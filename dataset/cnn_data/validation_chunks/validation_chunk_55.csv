"Everywhere you go on the Isle of Man, you'll see Manx flags - three conjoined white legs on a red background. For the Manx, the Triskelion is a powerful symbol of independent spirit and endurance, the motto being: 'Whichever way you throw, it will stand.' Lately, it's become a symbol for me too, of three islands. There's the island I've called home for the past 11 years, the island I write about in my novels, and somewhere in between, perhaps, a deeper truth about this beautiful rock in the middle of the Irish Sea. Independent spirit: The harbour at Ramsey, the Isle of Man's second biggest town . Legend: A carving of the sea god Manannan . Can a place with a reputation for being safe and sleepy really also be home to spies, killers and evil spirits that feature in my books? I like to think so, and here are a few reasons why. The weather might be mixed but the landscape is dramatic, whether seen from the sea, walking the coast path, or taking the electric railway to the top of the island's solitary mountain, Snaefell (from where, on a clear day, you can see the distant humped blurs of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales). The rich variety of locations is something I've grown to appreciate in my books, and something the Isle of Man film industry has thrived on during the past decade. Need a spooky cottage? The island has plenty. The same goes for lush glens and lonely coves. But the island provides more than great backdrops. It's compact, with a population in the region of 85,000, and while that makes it ideally manageable for a weekend visit, it also fosters something all writers rely on - rumours and hearsay. My first Isle of Man-set thriller, Safe House, grew out of a rumour I heard almost as soon as I moved here - namely, that it's used as a place to relocate people enrolled in UK witness protection schemes. Is the rumour true? I don't know for certain, but it seems credible to me. The island is isolated and has lots of out-of-the-way spots. The Isle of Man also its own very distinct identity. Where else could the population swell for a fortnight every June in celebration of a controversial motorbike festival that pits man against machine over a course run on almost 38 miles of public roads? The Isle of Man is isolated, with some out of the way spots, lush glens and lonely coves . Racing glory: Every summer the island hosts the world-famous TT races, with motorbikes reaching 200mph . The TT (Tourist Trophy) races have been in existence since 1907, with recent competitors recording top speeds of 200mph. But while most islanders are proud of the long tradition of racing greats who have tamed the course, the event is not without its critics. Like many others, I find it hard to reconcile the number of fatalities that have occurred with the racing glory, but I can't fail to admire how brave the riders must be. Another local oddity is Hop-tunaa - the Isle of Man's version of Halloween. Taking place every October 31, it shares many similarities with Halloween, but is still marked by some unique Manx twists. For example, Hop-tu-naa traditionalists carve lanterns from turnips instead of pumpkins, and children call from door-to-door singing nonsense songs instead of trick-or-treating. In fact, one of the songs was striking enough to become the basis for my new thriller, Dark Tides. It's a short step from rumours and hearsay to myths and legends, and the Isle of Man has some of the most interesting I've ever heard: from the sea god, Manannan, who cloaks the isle in a veil of mist to protect it from outside threats, to the Moddey Dhoo, a big black hound that haunts Peel Castle.

"Arranging to meet a stranger in a busy cafe last week, I needed to describe my appearance. I started: ‘I have long, dark hair with a fringe . . .’ That’s not because it’s an easy way to spot me, but because my hairstyle is the very thing that I recognise myself by — when I look in the mirror, when I picture myself, when I think of myself in the past or the future, it is my hair that I see first. For while other people might notice different features, or describe themselves in terms of their clothes, height or figure, for me it has always been this one thing that defines me. Scroll down for video . Daisy Goodwin: The writer was 'tressed to impress' aged six with her fringe and is still sporting that hairstyle today . And I don’t just mean it defines my appearance; it defines my inner identity, too. Some women use their hair to reflect their mood or a time in their life, they like to chop and change with the seasons and follow trends. Then there are women like me — and Jemima Khan — who keep the same hairstyle throughout their entire lives. This week, Jemima tweeted a photo of her childhood hair — golden, thick, long and framed with a fringe — identical to the style she still has. For us, our hairstyle is such a fundamental part of who we are that to change it would be as brutal and unthinkable as having plastic surgery. Cutting my hair off would be like losing part of my soul. It’s not that I think my hair is particularly fabulous — it might well look better with a different cut — but it’s the consistency that counts. Jemima Goldsmith: The socialite tweeted this picture of herself as a young girl (left) with the words: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' Keira Knightly: Today she's a red carpet icon, but the busy Hollywood A-lister was wearing an 'undone up-do' at ten . Since I was five it has always been shoulder length or just below with a choppy fringe. Sometimes it is longer, sometimes there are a few layers, but though I am 53, I haven’t changed my style since childhood. Back then, my grandmother cut it with kitchen shears; now Marcio, my lovely Portuguese hairdresser, uses high-tech scissors at vast expense. But the end result is pretty much the same. So while many people have embarrassing teenage photos of themselves with a mullet, perm or a disastrous dye, my ‘look’ — if you can call it that — has never wavered. And I relish that fact; I love peering nostalgically at photos of me in my 20s partying with friends and spotting the hair I still have and love. Or looking at my glowing, gloriously happy face at my wedding in 1989 and still admiring the hairdo. And somehow the style has come to encapsulate my character — it is shiny on a good day, albeit slightly messy and reliably straight. My STYLE is driven by my personality, too, for while there are women who don’t mind facing the world with their hair scraped back off their face or with pixie cuts that mean every emotion is visible, I am not one of them. Georgia May Jagger: From the age of nine to today, Mick's model daughter favours long blonde girlish waves . Patsy Kensit: The model, singer, actress and rocker's ex-wife has kept the blonde centre parting she had as a nine-year-old . I need my hair to hide behind, to chew when I am thinking, to pull over my face when I am embarrassed. For me, my hair is a veil, a barrier between me and the unkind scrutiny of the world. I don’t want people to see what I am thinking all the time. But it is a mental barrier, too — a comfort blanket, an unchanging element as my face changes. My world has transformed since I was a child, but throughout school, university, marriage and children, one thing has remained constant: my hair. Without the hairstyle I have always known I would feel strange and vulnerable. I’m certainly not alone. I used to work on TV makeover programmes and we would ruthlessly change women’s hairstyles because we knew that would guarantee an enormous emotional response. Only once have I experienced that trauma — and I have never been tempted to alter my hair again. I was 36 and the hairdresser talked me into having a really short haircut. I had just started a new job and part of me thought a sharp new style might turn me into a sharp, decisive person. The hairdresser cut it without a mirror, so I had no preparation for the shock of seeing my face without its normal framing. Kate Winslet: The award-winning actress and Titanic star obviously loves the casual wavy style she sported at nine . Brooke Shields: At 13 she was Hollywood royalty, and 37 years later the actress still has chic long tresses . I was hoping for liberation; instead when I saw myself shorn all I felt was horror. When I went home, my six-year-old daughter burst into inconsolable tears, crying: ‘You don’t look like my mummy any more.’ Even my husband, who doesn’t know the difference between a dress and a skirt, was shocked. ‘Why didn’t you tell me you were going to do this?’ he kept asking. Though he didn’t say it, I knew he was thinking: ‘You don’t look like my wife any more.’ And for several days, until the shock had worn off, my husband and daughter avoided looking at me as much as possible. I felt much the same way as my family — every time I looked in the mirror I could barely see myself there. I hated my reflection. For while I thought that cutting my hair would make me feel like Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday — young, free and liberated — I felt like Samson in the Old Testament, who lost all his strength when his hair was lopped off. Jodie Kidd: The catwalk queen retains the simple, quick and easy hairstyle she wore as an outdoors-loving school athlete . Angelina Jolie: From Tomb raider star to UN envoy, she favours the sideswept look she had at the age of 11 . I stopped feeling attractive. I couldn’t tell a story, let alone flirt, without my hair to play with. My hair took about six months to grow back — the longest six months of my life — and since then I have done nothing to it except a careful trim and colour to keep the grey hairs at bay. Basically, just what I need to do to keep my hair looking exactly as it always has. When my mother died two years ago, I found a cache of photographs of her as a young woman. In the last years of her life she had worn her hair up mostly, but when I saw these photos I realised she, too, kept the same hairstyle pretty much all her life — and it was identical to mine, shoulder length with a fringe. So, this hairstyle hasn’t just been worn for one lifetime, but two. Of course, there are moments when I think I should try a more mature hairstyle. But despite my advanced age, I simply don’t think I am mature enough to cope without my hair. For in my heart I am still a little girl peering through her fringe — and that’s what my hair helps me see in the mirror, too.

"Harry Kirkham was killed as he crossed the road outside Erdington police station in Birmingham . A 15-year-old schoolboy was knocked down and killed by a police car while walking home from  church with his younger brother. Harry Kirkham was run over by an officer on a routine patrol as he crossed the road outside Erdington Police Station in Birmingham. The teenager suffered a heart attack and was rushed to hospital but died the next day. Harry had been making his way home with his 13-year-old brother after attending a service at the nearby Potter's House Christian Fellowship Church when he was mowed down at 9pm on Wednesday. The officer, from Sutton Coldfield police station, gave the youngster first aid along with a passing paramedic who witnessed the crash. Police said he has been left 'traumatised' by the ordeal but has been questioned by detectives from the force's Professional Standards Department. A local resident, who saw the aftermath of the incident, but did not want to be named, added: 'There were blue flashing lights all along the road. 'I saw one young lad being comforted by a police officer - he looks in absolute shock. He was in floods of tears. 'I couldn't see much else apart from blankets and a stretcher and lots of emergency services. I didn't get too close though, you don't want to be disrespectful. 'Its a busy road and a lot of people bomb up and down it - but you don't expect a police officer to, especially if he isn't attending an emergency. It's an absolute tragedy.' Harry, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, suffered a cardiac arrested and was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. West Midlands Police confirmed the teenager tragically died as a result of his injuries yesterday afternoon.

Tributes have been left at the scene to the teenager who went into cardiac arrest after he was hit by a police officer's car- he died in hospital the next day . Pastor Lewis Claxton from the Potter's House Church added: 'He was running across the road probably. He wasn't playing a game or anything like that. 'Just beforehand, his brother Max told me that they were just going to the shops so they were on the way there at the time. 'I think he just did not use the crossing and thought he could just rush across the road when tragedy struck.' Chief Inspector Neil Hobson said: 'No parent should have to lose a child, particularly in such tragic circumstances. 'Our thoughts are with Harry's family following their tragic loss. 'As Harry was hit by a police car West Midlands Police has informed the Independent Police Complaints Commission who continue to be updated. 'We have launched an investigation to understand what happened last night and to provide answers. Hundreds of tributes have poured into the teen online and friends and family left messages at the scene including this touching tribute which read: 'To Harry, RIP, you are at peace now. My thoughts are with you and your family. You will be missed at church. From Ismail, Freda and family'. Another simply read: 'Rest in peace Harry-James, with love Faragher family xxxx' 'The police officer who was driving the car at the time has been left traumatised by the ordeal but is providing every assistance to the investigation.' The officer was on routine patrol in the area and was not responding to an emergency call when he struck Harry. A relative who answered the door at the family's semi-detached home yesterday morning said his parents had been left 'heartbroken'. He added: 'The family are too upset to talk. They are still at the hospital now. 'They are devastated and completely heartbroken.' Pastor  Claxton, 25, said Harry and his brothers had attended their services for the last three weeks. Speaking outside the church today he added: 'I was standing at the door of the church when I heard what seemed to sound like a car crash or a collision. 'I ran outside, along with another person from the church. We saw a police car in the road, and we ran over to the young man, where he was put in the recovery position by the other man from the church. Harry, pictured with his dad Craig, suffered a heart attack and was rushed to hospital but died the next day . 'I went over to his younger brother who was very upset. We'd had a service at 7.30pm and the brothers had attended for the last three weeks. 'We had just began to get to know them. It was very traumatic. 'Harry was a wonderful young man. He was very popular, he was just wonderful. 'He was full of life. He was friendly and everybody loved him. We only knew him for such a short time but he really was wonderful. Harry was described by his pastor as friendly and 'full of life' 'He had been coming here regularly for the past three weeks or so. He came at the end of February and had been coming since, every week. 'Everybody started to get to know him and became friends. 'We are doing and will be doing everything we can to support and help the family. We pray for them as much as we can and we send our deepest condolences to them.' Tributes, messages and flowers have been left at the scene where Harry was killed. Friends left a touching tribute on one, which read: 'To Harry, RIP, you are at peace now. My thoughts are with you and your family. You will be missed at church. From Ismail, Freda and family.'

"Would you reveal your biggest regret in the name of art? A young Romanian photographer took to the streets of  the UK and Romania to find strangers brave enough to confess their deepest, darkest secrets on camera. Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi, 22, from London, captured people of all ages  in various locations  in a bid to explore ideas of human interaction and communication. A new photo project shows people holding their regrets on handwritten signs. This woman's deepest regret was when she stole her sister's money . The girl on the left wrote: 'I regret that I forgot to take my baby doll with me today' and the boy (right) wrote 'I regret I do not have more time to play' Standing straight clutching holding their signs, the unnamed subjects stare straight into the University of Portsmouth graduate's lens, allowing viewers to judge them and draw their own conclusions. While some declared they had no regrets, others were much more forthcoming in their vulnerable state. Alcohol addiction, theft and smoking weed were among the most explosive revelations from those keen to unburden themselves. A young man with a smiling toddler in a pram confessed his drinking problem while a teenage wears the ghost of a smile as she admits stealing her sister's money. A couple now living in a British seaside town said: 'Our biggest regret is that we didn't move here many years ago. WE LOVE IT HERE' These young men regret supporting Middlesbrough and smoking cannabis . A remorseful woman regretted not being able to help her child more and another wished she had different parents. There were positive messages too though, with one elderly couple expressing joy at where they live, while a little girl simply wished she had brought her doll out with her. Alecsandra said of the project: 'This question has given to me the chance to have a profound connection between me and the interlocutor, thus managing to get into their soul and bring out a grinding they have for years.' The girl on the left wrote 'Not having the confidence to be the best I can' and the girl hiding behind her sign wrote 'What I did last night' This man regrets: 'Not saying ""I love you!"" enough' But while many people Alecsandra asked were happy to open up about their experiences, others flatly refused. She said: 'It is true that many of the surveyed people had some abstention regarding their answers, and some of them said that it is too personal, but I had the chance to meet kind people to whom I could talk.' The project was inspired by the work of Gillian Wearing, OBE, an English conceptual artist who was part of the Young British Artists' movement in the 1990s. Wearing uses photography and video to document the confessions of ordinary people and won the Turner Prize in 1997 for her '60 Minutes Silence' and 'Sacha And Mum' videos. This woman revealed that she regretted: 'That I did not have the right parents' The man with the pram on the left confessed 'Developing an addiction to alcohol' and the man on the right wrote 'Not becoming a footballer' Alecsandra believes that her project had the power to help the people she met, by helping them to offload their burdens. She said: 'I think that frequently when you share your thought with somebody, even if it is strange person, you release the black stain which is on the soul and you can feel free. 'I do not trust in people who say that they do not have regrets. 'In my opinion, there is a difference between not having regrets and not thinking about them. 'Not thinking about regrets is better, because what you have done is in the past.' Submit your own regrets into the project here, or view the entire photo series on Alecsandra's website.

"Entertainment reporter Peter Ford has angered the Twitter community after slamming Chrissie Swan's decision to leave her one-year-old baby at home to appear on a reality show. MIX FM DJ Chrissie, who is currently the favourite to take out the crown on the channel 10 show I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, has been in the South African jungle for the past six weeks, leaving her three children in Australia with their father Chris Saville.

"It is the home where her father is said to have confronted Prince Charles and thundered: 'What are your intentions towards my daughter?' And now the seven-bedroom former rectory once described by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall as 'perfect in every way' is on the market for £3.15million. The Laines, set within five acres on the edge of Plumpton village in East Sussex, has a paddock, wide lawns, a secret garden, a swimming pool and tennis court. Dating back to the 18th Century, the Grade-II listed home is spread over three floors and even boasts a Gothic style orangery added in the Seventies. The Duchess of Cornwall's childhood home The Laines (pictured) in Plumpton, East Sussex, is on the market for £3.15million . The former rectory set within five acres on the edge of Plumpton village in East Sussex, has wide lawns and a swimming pool . It is only the second time in 63 years that the property comes to the market, pictured is the conservatory decorated with plants . It is only the second time in 63 years that the property has come to the market and was home to Camilla's father Major Bruce Shand for 45 years. The former rectory was bought off him by actor James Wilby, best known for his aristocratic roles in Maurice, Gosford Park and A Handful Of Dust, and his wife Shana. They decided to sell the home in August last year with a guide price of £3.25million, but the couple have now dropped the price. Camilla has fond memories of the years she spent at the historic property with her siblings Annabel and Mark after the family moved to Sussex  to be near Sonia Cubitt, Camilla’s maternal grandmother. It was from here that Camilla, aged four-and-a-half, started out for her first school, Dumbrell’s, before completing her education at Queens Gate School in Kensington and finishing schools in Switzerland and France. Prince Charles came to visit the house several times, both before Camilla’s marriage and also later while on shore posting at Portsmouth during his Royal Navy service in the early Seventies. But the majority of the couple's secret assignations were made at Camilla’s grandmother’s home, Hall Place at West Meon.

The open plan kitchen and breakfast room in the Grade-II listed building has polished wooden surfaces, flooring and wooden beams . Major Bruce Shand lived at the home in East Sussex for 45 years, pictured in the gardens at the former rectory with his dog . The gardens were re-designed by well-known landscape gardener, Lanning Roper, and include a walled kitchen garden (pictured) It was once reported that Major Shand hauled Prince Charles to The Laines to confront him about the intense public scrutiny his daughter was under. But later it emerged that the husband of one of Camilla’s best friends, Charles Benson, had sold the totally fallacious tale to fund a chronic gambling habit. At the time, because of the feverish atmosphere surrounding the disclosure of Charles and Camilla’s relationship, the story seemed to have the ring of truth. Prince Charles has praised the way his wife has tackled the challenge of joining the royal family as ‘brilliant’ ahead of their 10th wedding anniversary next month and it remains to be seen whether he will buy the property. Since marrying the prince in 2005, Camilla – once one of the most hated women in Britain - has gone from being a middle-aged mother who lived much of her life out of the spotlight, to taking on a range of charitable patronages and learning about the rigours of royal engagements. The main rooms of the historic house have high ceilings and large Georgian windows with wonderful views of the garden and Downs. A spokesman for agent Strutt and Parker said: 'On the first floor there are seven main bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a shower room. The rooms to the south and east enjoy stunning views of the gardens and South Downs. 'The superb gardens were re-designed by the well-known landscape gardener, Lanning Roper and are a particular feature of the property. They include formal lawns planted with mature trees and shrubs, a magnificent walled kitchen garden, secluded swimming pool area, a rose garden and an orchard.'

"A Colorado woman accused of luring an expectant mother to a basement and cutting the baby from her belly will not be charged with murder. Catherine Olguin, a spokeswoman for the Boulder County District Attorney's Office, said prosecutors won't bring the charge in the baby's death, but she declined to say why or what charges Dynel Lane, 34, will face. Investigators say Lane lured Michelle Wilkins, 26, to her Longmont home March 18 with an ad on Craigslist offering baby clothes. Inside, police say, Lane attacked Wilkins and extracted her unborn baby girl. Scroll down for video . Dynel Lane (left)  will not be charged with murder for cutting out the baby of expectant mom Michelle Wilkins (right) Wilkins had gone over to Lane's Longmont, Colorado home (above) on March 18 after responding to a CraigsList ad for baby clothes . Lane's husband found the infant in a bathtub and rushed the child to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Wilkins survived the attack and was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday. District Attorney Stan Garnett is expected to release more information Friday about the decision not to charge Lane with murder, and the coroner's office is expected to release the findings of an autopsy performed on the baby. The gruesome attack revived the highly-charged debate over when a fetus can legally be considered a human being. Even though the baby girl died, legal experts say the situation is complicated by the fact that Colorado is one of 12 states that do not have laws making the violent death of an unborn child a homicide. State legislators in 2013 voted down such a measure over fears it would interfere with abortion rights, and voters overwhelmingly agreed when they rejected a similar ballot measure in 2014. Advocates say the attack shows the need for a fetal homicide law. Naomi Garcia, 11, holds a sign in the direction of passing cars during a protest against Dynel Lane . Legal experts say a person can still be charged with homicide for an unborn child's death under existing Colorado law if the baby was alive outside the mother's body and the act that led to its death also occurred there. After rejecting a fetal homicide law in 2013, Colorado legislators did pass a measure that makes it a felony to violently cause the death of a mother's fetus. The maximum punishment under that provision is 32 years in prison. The maximum punishment for homicide in Colorado is the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole. Lane is expected to be formally charged on Friday.","Dynel Lane, 34, will not be charged with murder for cutting out the baby of expectant mom Michelle Wilkins .

"Official records claim a staggering 6.5million 'super-centurions' have reached the grand age of 112 in the U.S. - but it is all down to missing death certificates. A record-keeping blip means Social Security records appear to show America has a group of super-centenarians equal to the population of El Salvador. But in fact there are only 19 people who say they are over the age of 112 in the U.S. today, and Social Security admits there are only 13 still getting benefits. Mistake: A record-keeping blip means Social Security records appear to show America has a group of super-centenarians equal to the population of El Salvador (stock picture) Record-holder: Just 19 women are over the age of 122 in America, with Gertrude Weaver, of Arkansas, pictured, the oldest among them at 116 years and 255 days old . The error has been caused because Social Security does not have death records for millions of people, the oldest of whom was born in 1869. That would mean, were that person still alive, they would be 146 years old - 24 years older than the oldest living person in history, Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who was 122 when she died in 1997. They would also be considerably older than America's oldest living resident, Gertrude Weaver of Arkansas, who is 116 years and 255 days old. But far from being something to chuckle about, Republican Senator Ron Johnson, who represents Wisconsin, has raised it as a cause for concern. It means there are millions of Social Security numbers which are still active, so a number could be used to report wages, open bank accounts, obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds. Problem: Senator Ron Johnson, pictured, says the active numbers are an issue as they can be used illegally . 'That is a real problem,' said Senator Johnson. 'When you have a fake Social Security number, that's what allows you to fraudulently do all kinds things, claim things like the earned income tax credit or other tax benefits.' Johnson is chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which plans a hearing Monday on problems with death records maintained by the Social Security Administration. The agency said it is working to improve the accuracy of its death records. However, it would be costly and time-consuming to update 6.5million files created at a time when the agency used paper records, said Sean Brune, a senior adviser to the agency's deputy commissioner for budget, finance, quality and management. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935, and the first old-age monthly benefit check was paid in 1940. 'The records in this review are extremely old, decades-old, and unreliable,' Brune said. The internal watchdog's report does not document any fraudulent or improper payments to people using these Social Security numbers - but it raises red flags that it could be happening. Landmark: President Franklin Roosevelt signs the Social Security bill in Washington in 1935 . For example, nearly 67,000 of the Social Security numbers were used to report more than $3billion in wages, tips and self-employment income from 2006 to 2011, according to the report. One Social Security number was used 613 different times, while 194 numbers were used at least 50 times each. Illegal immigrants often use fake or stolen Social Security numbers to get jobs and report wages, as do other people who do not want to be found by the government, and thieves are known to use stolen Social Security numbers to claim fraudulent tax refunds. The IRS estimated it paid out $5.8billion in fraudulent tax refunds in 2013 because of identity theft. But the Social Security Administration is trying to combat the problem, generating a list of dead people known as the 'Death Master File', so employers can compare the numbers they are given with those which should no longer be in use. But none of the 6.5million people cited by the inspector general's report was on the list.","Millions of active numbers from people who would now be over 112 .

"Ikram Ismail has been jailed for stalking Big Brother winner Kate Lawler and leaving her bizarre gifts . A stalker who sent ex-Big Brother star Kate Lawler bizarre Islamic gifts causing the bomb squad to be scrambled has been jailed. Army bomb disposal experts were sent to the offices of Rock FM, in Preston, Lancashire, where Miss Lawler works as a DJ, after obsessed Ikram Ismail sent her a box containing a burnt Koran, a court heard. Ismail, of Preston, had never met the 34-year-old personality but started leaving strange gifts at the studio on St Paul's Square, in Deepdale, Preston Magistrates' Court heard. On the first occasion, in February 2014, the bomb squad was called to a suspicious box, which was later found to contain a Koran, wrapped in traditional fabric. Among other strange 'gifts' Ismail, who pleaded guilty to stalking, left in the studio grounds over the next 12 months were a book entitled the Ninety-Nine Names of Allah, a burnt Koran, a burnt jumper, a box containing Muslim leaflets, and a 'Kate' keyring. He also left the DJ chocolates and a clock, scattered safety pins, a soup cookbook and a parcel containing a 'love' fridge magnet and chocolates. Prosecutor Suzy Privett told the court that on Hallowe'en last year, DJ Jordan North saw the defendant trying to get into a party, believing Kate Lawler was there. A PCSO later attended and found Ismail, and he was issued with an acceptable behaviour contract. However, on Valentine's Day this year he sent further gifts to Miss Lawler, followed by a card signed 'Ikram'. The celebrity became aware of his behaviour, and when she checked her social media accounts, she found several messages from him dating back to July 2014, the court heard. Army bomb disposal experts were sent to the offices of Rock FM, in Preston, Lancashire, where Miss Lawler works as a DJ, after obsessed Ismail sent her a box containing a burnt Koran, a court heard . In a victim impact statement, she said she accepted her career attracted a 'certain amount of attention', but said she was unnerved by his attention and she had a right to a private and family life. She said the thought of bumping into him frightened her. Miss Lawler declined to comment further. It is not the first time Miss Lawler has been stalked. While working for Kerrang! Radio in Birmingham, she was sent underwear and sinister gifts. Obsessed Mark Taylor sent dozens of newspaper cuttings and crude pictures to the former reality TV star's workplace. In much of the correspondence, he declared his love for the DJ, sending her topless tabloid snaps of herself, a dictionary and, bizarrely, a dinner plate. He even sent a magazine picture of two pairs of feet at the bottom of a bed with the male pair marked with his name and the female marked with 'Kate.' Among other strange 'gifts' Ismail, who pleaded guilty to stalking, left in the studio grounds over the next 12 months were a book entitled the Ninety-Nine Names of Allah, a burnt Koran, a burnt jumper, a box containing Muslim leaflets, and a 'Kate' keyring . The 49-year-old set about his campaign of mailing in 2005, but after breaking three separate restraining orders, Judge Anthony King jailed him for eight months in 2011. The Beckenham-born celebrity shot to fame after winning Big Brother's third series, broadcast in 2002. She later became a DJ on Capital FM and co-presented a breakfast TV show. She has also taken part in game shows and done modelling work. District Judge Jane Goodwin jailed Ismail for two months and ordered him to pay an £80 victim surcharge.","Ikram Ismail sent ex-Big Brother star Kate Lawler Islamic themed gifts .

"Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano is set to push for migrant screening and processing centres in Africa, at meetings with his EU counterparts in Brussels . Italy is to outline proposals to fast-track African migrants and send them directly to EU countries including Britain. Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano is set to push for migrant screening and processing centres in Africa, at meetings with his EU counterparts in Brussels tomorrow. Mr Alfano claims that the migrant crisis should be tackled with refugee camps on African soil, where asylum seekers could be identified and then distributed evenly throughout European states. The minister’s proposals come as the EU border chief warned that there are up to a million migrants in Libya preparing to cross the Mediterranean. Italy, with its southernmost landfall just a 80km (49 miles) from Africa, is the first port of call for many seeking new lives in Europe. With Libya descending into ever-worsening chaos and lawlessness, almost 9,000 migrants arrived on Italian shores in January and February, up 43 per cent on last year’s record figures. Fabrice Leggeri director of EU border control Frontex said: ‘Our sources tell us there are anywhere between 500,000 to a million people ready to leave from Libya.’ ‘We have to be ready to address a more difficult situation than last year.’ With militias loyal to the Islamic State making frightening inroads in Libya, it is feared that jihadis could enter Europe by boat hidden among migrants. Minister Alfano, of the centre-right NCD party, said the solution has to be found in Africa: ‘We must resolve the problem at its origin. There are two paths, stabilise Libya and create refugee camps in . Africa so that the screening is done there, and those who have the right to asylum are identified with a balanced distribution between the European countries.’ He told Italian television La 7 in advance of the meeting that Libya has become ‘an international priority.’ ‘The camps would do a preventative screening,’ he said. ‘Who has refugee status would be distributed in a balanced way among various European countries, those who aren’t would not be given permission to leave.’ Italy is the first place many people arrive when seeking a new life in Europe. These migrants were rescued from the sea after the boat they were travelling in capsised . Three of the camps would be based in Niger, Tunisia and Sudan, according to Italian media reports. Natasha Bertaud, spokesman for the EU executive, said the plans were in an ‘orientation phase’ . She said the Commission was ‘aware that some member states are in discussions to develop centres in North . Africa and are in contact with the International Organisation for Migration and UNHCR about the possibility of developing centres for migrants to facilitate screening and logistics for the voluntary return of economic migrants, as well as identifying those who need help.’ A pilot project in Niger is under discussion, she said. Deploying liaison officers in third party countries is ‘a long term project’ she said. It is thought up to a million people might be willing to make the crossing from Libya. Pictured: A group of migrants arrived in Lampedusa few days ago, arrive in the harbour of Lampedusa to be transferred to Sicily . The proposals are likely to meet opposition in norther European states that may bear the brunt of a future quota system. But the plans were welcomed in Italy. Centre left PD Senator Luigi Manconi head of the Human Rights commission said: ‘I learn with satisfaction that minister Alfano will present tomorrow in Brussels a project for the opening with the UNHCR and the IOM of at least three migration centres which would allow them to process asylum requests for Europe. ‘The facilities would be created by the EU in conjunction with international humanitarian organisations to two ends: avoiding the illegal crossings of the Mediterranean with the risks that it brings and distributing the asylum seekers in Europe according to balanced reception quotas.’","Italian interior minister to push for migrant screening centres in Africa .

"The number of NHS patients waiting longer than six weeks for crucial medical tests including cancer has hit a record high, official figures revealed this morning. Some 18,740 patients had to wait longer than six weeks to take cancer and other tests in January – more than five times higher than in May 2010 when the Coalition took over. The figures cover 15 of the most important NHS tests, including seven that detect cancers and others for heart disease. The number of NHS patients waiting longer than six weeks for crucial medical tests including Cancer has hit a record high . Just under 14,000 patients waited longer than six weeks for one of the key cancer tests. Some 2,954 patients waited too long for MRI scans, compared to 374 in May 2010, with a further 1,125 patients were forced to wait longer than they should for CT scans – up from 215 five years ago. Just under 2,904 patients in January waited too long for ultrasound tests - not including pregnant women – up from 291 in 2010. Four crucial endoscopy tests that detect bowel and stomach cancers have also seen a huge spike in patients waiting longer than six weeks. Some 6,978 patients in January waited too long for one of the tests – up from 976 in May 2010. A Labour Government will guarantee that NHS patients in England will wait no longer than one week for cancer tests and results by 2020. In 2014, 20,775 patients who were diagnosed with cancer waited for than 62 days to begin treatment. Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the figures showed David Cameron had 'damaged the care that Cancer patients are receiving' Andy Burnham, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said the figures were 'damning evidence' of the Government's failure on NHS waiting lists. Mr Burnham said: 'He has presided over a major cut in the cancer budget in this Parliament and this has damaged the care that cancer patients are receiving. 'All the gains that Labour made have been lost and the NHS is heading in the wrong direction. Thousands of families are waiting too long for tests, facing all the anxiety that means, and cancer is being diagnosed at a later stage where treatment is less likely to be successful. 'That's why Labour will guarantee a maximum one-week wait for cancer tests. 'The NHS as we know it can't survive five more years of the Tories. Families struggling with cancer can't take the risk and, despite all the warnings, persisted with an NHS reorganisation that disrupted cancer services.'","18,740 patients waited longer than six weeks to take NHS tests in January .

"Eating three meals a day is as much a part of our routine as getting up in the morning and going to sleep in the evening. Now, experts have warned eating breakfast, lunch and dinner may be damaging our health. In fact, there is no evidence eating three square meals a day is beneficial to the body’s needs for energy, the website Mother Jones reports. In fact, skipping meals and fasting could actually be better for health than sticking to rigid eating patterns. There is no evidence eating three meals a day is healthier than eating in other forms, such as six or nine meals a day . Historian Abigail Carroll told  journalist Kiera Butler that these meals are cultural constructions European settlers enforced on Native Americans. In her new book, ‘Three Squares: The Invention of the American Meal’, Ms Carroll said the settlers ate meals at regimented times and considered this more ‘civilised’ than the natives whose eating patterns varied with the seasons, and included fasting. A quirk of history has meant this pattern has been heralded as healthy, when in fact there is no evidence for this assertion, Ms Carroll said. For example, breakfast is considered the most important meal of the day largely due to advertising campaigns by cereal and juice companies, she claims. In fact, a 2014 study by the University of Bath found whether or not a person ate breakfast had zero effect on the overall calories they consumed in a day. Those who ate breakfast did burn more calories than those who skipped it, but they burned off the extra calories later in the day, meaning the net calorie consumption was the same. New research shows skipping meals and fasting could actually be beneficial for health, triggering weight loss and strengthening the immune system . Similar University of Alabama research found eating breakfast or not made no difference to dieters trying to lose weight. And last year, MailOnline reported on research published in the journal Cell Metabolism, which found eating meals within an eight hour window each day could help a person shed weight. Fasting can be good for your health, experts claim. A study found that fasting for two days or more can help to kick-start the immune system, especially if it has been damaged by ageing or cancer treatment. It encourages the body to replace old and damaged cells, U.S. researchers said. Valter Longo, a longevity expert at the University of Southern California, said: ‘When you starve, the system tries to save energy, and one of the things it can do to save energy is to recycle a lot of the immune cells that are not needed, especially those that may be damaged.’ His team found fasting for two to four days every six months forced the body into survival mode, using up stores of fat and sugar and breaking down old cells. ‘The body then sent a signal telling stem cells to regenerate and “rebuild the entire system”.' Mice fed a high-fat diet within an eight hour time frame – for example between 9am and 5pm – were both healthier and slimmer than those given the same number of calories throughout the whole day. Even when obese mice had their eating window reduced to nine hours, they were able to drop five per cent of their body weight within a few days – while still enjoying the same amount of calories. Whether a person eats three large meals a day or six smaller ones makes no difference to their overall calorie count, a 2010 study published in the British journal of Nutrition found. Researchers found no weight or hormonal differences between the two groups. Last year, a University of Warwick study found no difference between women who ate two meals a day and another group that ate five. And new research suggests fasting - deemed 'uncivilized' by the European settlers - could actually be healthy. Advocates of the 5:2 diet, which involves limiting food to just 500 calories on two days a week, say denying the body food leads to weight loss, a longer lifespan and lower blood pressure. Similarly, a University of Southern California study published last year found fasting for two to four days every six months forces the body into survival mode, using up stores of fat and sugar and breaking down old cells. This caused the body's entire immune system to regenerate, providing better protection against infection and disease, experts said.","Abigail Carroll wrote 'Three Squares: The Invention of the American Meal'

"The King may have left the building too soon but the chance to own his old tour bus, marriage certificate or even one of his prescription bottles is still alive. A number of Elvis Presley's personal items will soon be put up for auction, which will also include his 1971 Stutz Blackhawk car, a diamond necklace he gave to his nurse and the shirt he wore for his first ever live performance in 1954. Also featured is an MGM personnel form that Elvis signed for his Jailhouse Rock film in 1957, which includes the star's old address, social security number and emergency contact. Scroll down for video . A number of Elvis Presley's personal items will soon be put up for auction, including the 'TCB' tour bus that he personally bought for his backup band Sumner and the Stamps . These are just some of the items Julien's Auctions of Beverly Hills will feature in the 'Property from the Life and Career of Elvis Presley' collection, which will be auctioned at the New York Hard Rock Cafe on May 16 . These are just some of the items Julien's Auctions of Beverly Hills will feature in the 'Property from the Life and Career of Elvis Presley' collection, which will be auctioned at the New York Hard Rock Cafe on May 16. The standout is the 'TCB' tour bus that was once driven into a cornfield by the King of Rock and Roll himself. Elvis personally paid for the bus for his backup band, Sumner and the Stamps. His signed $25,000 deposit check is framed on its wall. According to Martin Nolan, executive director of Julien's Auctions, Elvis and JD Sumner were 'like brothers'. Sumner even sang at his funeral. It was Elvis who said the band needed their own tour bus. Sumner was reluctant to take 'any financial funding' but eventually accepted and let his friend drive the bus whenever he pleased . It seats up to 12 people and includes nine sleeping berths. It has since been renovated to its original state . The two became fast friends in Memphis when Elvis was living in public housing, two blocks from the auditorium where Sumner and the Stamps used to perform every month. One month Elvis didn't show up to a gig. When he returned the next month Sumner asked about his absence. Elvis admitted he had to skip the show because he couldn't afford the 50cent ticket. From then on Sumner let him attend the shows for free. The favor was returned when Sumner and the Stamps became Elvis' back-up band, touring with the King from 1971 until his death in 1977. It was Elvis who said the band should get their own tour bus. Sumner had the bus 'decked out' as a tribute to Elvis and had the TCB lightning bolt logo, which was Elvis' slogan and stood for 'Taking Care of Business', emblazoned on the front of the bus . The walls are decorated with Elvis records, pictures of the band and even an old set list (pictured) Elvis became fast friends with JD Sumner (right of the singer), whose band toured with the singer from 1971 until his death in 1977. Sumner even sang at Elvis' funeral . According to Nolan, Sumner was reluctant to take 'any financial funding' from his close friend but eventually accepted and let Elvis drive the bus whenever he pleased. Nolan said Sumner 'decked out' the bus as a tribute to Elvis and had the TCB lightning bolt logo, which was Elvis' slogan and stood for 'Taking Care of Business', emblazoned on its front. The TCB bus, which seats up to 12 people and has nine sleeping berths, has since been renovated to its original state. The walls are decorated with Elvis records, pictures of the band and even an old set list. Nolan calls it a 'mobile museum' for the late great rocker. The bus' current price estimate is $100,000-$200,000, according to the Associated Press. Also up for auction is the King of Rock and Roll's 1971 two-seater Stutz Blackhawk car, which is estimated to sell for $400,000 to $600,000 .

"The banks of the Dead Sea are under threat from soaring numbers of sinkholes that are appearing as the salt lake dries up, an environmental group has warned. EcoPeace Middle East estimates that there are more than 3,000 sinkholes now along the banks of the salt lake, which is bordered by Israel and Jordan. Water evaporation from the lake - which is occurring at nearly four feet per year - drawing freshwater into the pockets of salt left behind by the lake. Environmental groups report that there are now more than 3,000 sinkholes, shown above filled with water, along the banks of the main body of the Dead Sea, caused by the loss of water from the giant salt lake . As the salt dissolves in the fresh water, it causes the earth above it to collapse. Gidon Bromberg, director of EcoPeace Middle East claims that the appearance of the sinkholes has been accelerating in recent years. For thousands of years, the Dead Sea has attracted visitors who come to float in its salty waters and reap its reported health benefits. But the salt lake's water elves have fallen from 394 metres below sea level in the 1960s to about 423 meters below sea level at the end of 2012. As a result, the Sea’s water surface area has been reduced  by one third: from roughly 950 square kilometers to 637 square kilometers today. The water level continues  to drop at an alarming pace of 0.8 to 1.2 meters per year. The significant decline of the water level over the past 30 years is due to diversion of water from the Jordan River and from the Dead Sea itself due to population increase. The first one appeared in the 1980s, by 1990 there were 40 and by 2005 there were 1,000 holes. Now, Mr Bromberg says, a new sinkhole is appearing almost every day. Speaking to ABC News, Mr Bromberg said: 'These sink holes are a direct result of the inappropriate mismanagement of water resources in the region. 'They could develop overnight or over time, making them unpredictable and very dangerous.' Mr Bromberg and his colleagues believe the rate of these sinkholes appearing has been increased by the construction of dams and reservoirs beside the lake. Water is also pumped from the lake to be evaporated so that minerals such as potash and bromide can be extracted. Water is also pumped from the lake to help maintain the pools that sit outside the spa hotels that attract tourists from around the world. Sitting nearly 1,300ft below sea level, the Dead Sea is the lowest inland area in the world and has a salinity of almost 33 per cent. Sink holes like this one at Mineral Beach beside the Dead Sea on the West Bank are becoming more common . These sinkholes appeared in the fields in south east corner of the Dead Sea near to the Lisan Peninsula . It has historically been maintained by a flow of fresh water from rivers and streams that have equaled the water is loses to evaporation in the scorching heat - about 160 billion gallons a year. Now the Dead Sea is thought to receive less than 10 per cent of the water it needs to maintain its size and it has declined from being 50 miles long in the 1950s to around 30 miles long today. Warning signs now dot the shores of the lake to highlight the danger of the open pits that have been appearing as a result of the sea's shrinkage. Mr Bromberg fears that the sinkholes may soon start posing a threat to the roads and infrastructure that run alongside the Dead Sea. Israel's Transportation Ministry had to close down a stretch of its Route 90 in January after several metres on its eastern side sank by two inches. The Dead Sea is an inland lake that sits on the border between Israel and Jordan, as shown in the map above . The salt formations, seen in the aerial view above, are left behind as the mineral rich water evaporates away . This sink hole beside the Dead Sea, caused by collapsing alt deposits left by the lake, has filled with water .","Environmental group estimates there are 3,000 sinkholes beside Dead Sea .
It claim that new sink holes are on the banks appearing almost every day .
They say the lake is being over exploited causing it to drop by 4 feet a year .

"A 14-year-old Sacramento girl who was given only a one-percent chance of surviving a life-threatening condition is looking forward to a trip to Disneyland. Paid for by the kindness of strangers donating to her gofundme page, Zoe Deibel suffers from a condition known as fetal hydrops, which causes fluid to collect on her lungs. Delivered by emergency Cesarean section at 33-weeks old, doctors told Zoe's mother and father that her chances of living much longer were almost non-existent. Bravery: Zoe Deibel has battled fetal hydrops since her birth. Doctors told her parents she had a one percent chance of survival at birth . Fighter: Zoe has always dreamed of traveling to Disneyland and has had to abort one attempt to get there in the past . Sick: Fetal hydrops affects Zoe's lungs and means she only has half the capacity of another 14-year-old girl . 'Every year they said she wasn't going to make it. And every year she proved them wrong,' mom Christine Deibel told KTLA sister station KTXL on Saturday. Since then, brave Zoe has been on life support multiple times and had six surgeries to repair his legs, which also suffer because of her illness. Indeed, her condition has meant that she once got to Disneyland only to be forced to turn around because she was too sick. Her lungs are so underdeveloped they only received about half the air she needs. Tough: Mom, Christine Deibel and Zoe make silly faces for the camera (right) while (left) Zoe recovers during one of her many visits to hospital . Mom, dad and Zoe: Doctors told the Deibel's that they should say good bye to their daughter shortly after she was born 14-years ago. She is still going strong now . Resolving to get Zoe to Disneyland and to also get her the portable oxygen concentrator tank she needs, the gofundme page is almost at its $10,000 target. Zoe told KTXl what the oxygen tank would mean to her. 'Go to my friend's house randomly, just stay after school or be able to do recess or something more often,' she said. The godfundme page tells Zoe's story and Jack Allen, the man who set it up, said his phone is going like crazy. 'From everywhere. My phone beeps all the time of 'you have another donation coming in,' Allen said. Once she has visited Disneyland, Zoe told KTXl that she wants to be a chef someday.","Zoe Diebel suffers incurable condition known as fetal hydrops .

"Federal prosecutors could file corruption charges against New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez by the end of the week, ending a years-long saga that has had the Democratic politician livign and working under a shadow of criminal suspicion. The Wall Street Journal reported that the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would see charges filed in his native New Jersey, citing people familiar with the FBI's investigation. The allegations against Menendez involve claims that he used his office to promote the business interests of a Democratic Party donor and close friend in exchange for personal gifts. Menendez has denied any wrongdoing, vowing that he is 'not going anywhere.' But a grand jury probe that has lasted for two years coudl complicate his future. THE SENATOR: Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption . POLITICS: (l-r) Menendez, donor Salomon Melgen, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and her husband Paul, posed in February 2012 at a National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials gala . Menendez, 61, has seen pressure from the Obama administration over his positions on Cuba and Iran, leading some Republicans who share his foreign policy views to suspect that the White House is exacting retribution on him. But more troubling are the ethics questions lingering about Menendez's relationship with Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, a wealthy and prolific donor. The senator's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on his friend's behalf, pushing back against accusations of overbilling the Medicare system by $8.9 million. Menendez has also repaid Melgen $58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor's private jet, mostly to the posh Dominican Republic resot Casa de Campo. But his spokeswoman fiercely denied he has done anything illegal even as a conservative group is calling for him to resign and face the music. Tricia Enright, Menendez's communications director, told Daily Mail Online in a statement earlier this month that 'we believe all of the Senator's actions have been appropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that.' 'Any actions taken by Senator Menendez or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason.' 'The Senator has counted Dr. Melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades,' Enright said. 'The two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other’s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts.' COY: Attorney General Eric Holder wouldn't talk on Friday about whether charges are forthcoming for Menendez, saying 'I can't comment' She called the investigation's beginnings 'suspect,' referring to 'false allegations' that have been 'discredited' in the past. Meanwhile, the conservative activist group American Commitment has called on Menendez to resign his office. On a new website called ByeBob.com, the group claims he 'unethically, and likely criminally, compromised his ability to represent the people of New Jersey.' CNN reported that the investigation into Menendez is reaching a crescendo, with prosecutors under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out on some charges. Attorney General Eric Holder, according to the network, has already given his approval. But he insisted 'I can't comment on that' when a reporter asked him about the report Friday afternoon after Obama gave a speech in South Carolina. Menendez's first high-level meeting at HHS related to Melgen's Medicare troubles occurred on June 7, 2012, according to court documents seen by the New Jersey Law Journal. The government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with Marilyn Tavenner, who was then in charge of the agency's Medicare and Medicaid subagency. Court papers also indicate Menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call, and then took Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, to an August 2, 2012 meeting with the Department of Health and Human Services's then-secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. CNN reported that Melgen was one of the Medicare system's most-reimbursed doctors nationwide, during the years when he was also a major donor to Menendez and to the Majority PAC. That political action committee, run by former Reid staffers, collected more than $700,000 from Melgen and made sure $600,000 of it benefited Menendez’s re-election campaign. The senator, now the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman until two months ago, has become a thorn in the White House's side by taking positions that grate on President Obama. Menendez opposed the presdient's rapprochement with Cuban strongman Raul Castro, saying in December that his actions 'have vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.' He has stood in the way of the State Department's negotiations with Iran, threatening to lead Congress in imposing new sanctions on the Islamic Republic if it doesn't shelve its nuclear ambitions. The White House has insisted the Iranians can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain. 'I have to be honest with you,' Menendez said during a January 21 Capitol Hill hearing. 'The more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran.' While he is not among the senate's super-rich elites, the New Jersey legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges: His legal defense fund has already collected, and spent, more than $1 million. Last week two of his Senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case, arguing that the senator's actions, and theirs, are protected by the U.S. Constitution's 'Speech or Debate' clause. Those words in America's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny, including Justice Department investigations, while they are actively working on legislation. THE DOCTOR: Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida ophthalmologist and a major Menendez donor, was ordered to pay back Medicare for $8.9 million in overbillings, and Menendez intervened with HHS for him . SEARCH WARRANT: A January 30 raid of Melgen's medical practice yielded van-loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files . According to the New Jersey Law Journal, aide Michael Barnard refused to answer 50 questions about Menendez's conversations with Sebelius and Tavenner, and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator's office and Melgen's lawyer-lobbyist about those conversations. Another more senior aide, former Menendez chief counsel Kerri Talbot, reportedly refused to testify about a separate mattter. The grand jury wanted to know if Talbot had emailed a staffer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port-screening equipment – principally cargo-container x-ray machines – to the Dominican Republic. Melgen, the senator's donor, controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through. The x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband. NARCO-POLITICS: Dr. Melgen controlled a company that wanted a Dominican ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs. Menendez allegedly helped ensure the U.S. wouldn't provide the machines for free . In 2013 FBI agents and investigators from HHS raided Melgen's West Palm Beach, Florida medical office, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. Over a period of nearly 24 hours, then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing whatnews reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files. The Washington Post reported at the time that HHS auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments Melgen's practice billed to Medicare. Other news reports described an alleged scheme in which Melgen used leftover fluid from single-use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients, billing Medicare for a new vial with each treatment. The government typically paid $2,000 for each container, raising the possibility that Melgen could have overbilled Medicare between $4,000 and $6,000 per vial.","New Jersey Sen.

"A top university official ran up a £45,000 expenses bill in just 14 months, it has emerged. Sheila O'Neal, executive director of development at Bangor University, spent the money on flights, hotels and meals - including a £10,000 trip to New York for herself and three colleagues. During the trip last March, the group watched Emma Thompson and Bryn Terfel on Broadway in the  Stephen Sondheim production production of Sweeney Todd. Expenses: Sheila O'Neal, executive director of development at Bangor University, pictured, spent the money on flights, hotels and meals - including a £10,000 trip to New York for herself and three colleagues . Ms O'Neal, who took up her post in the autumn of 2013, also spent more than £1,000 on taxis, £5,400 on food and £14,000 on hotels between October 2013 and December 2014. The figures were obtained by S4C’s current affairs programme Y Byd ar Bedwar. The university defended the New York visit, saying it was necessary in order to raise funds for future developments. Ms O'Neal, 60, was joined on the trip by vice-chancellor Professor John Hughes and his wife, Dr Xinyu Wu, the university's director of international development. Elen ap Robert, artistic director of Pontio, the university's new arts centre, was also invited. The centre will include a 450-seat theatre named after Terfel, who has an honourary doctorate from the institution. Colleagues: Ms O'Neal, 60, was joined on the trip by vice-chancellor Professor John Hughes, left, and his wife, Dr Xinyu Wu, right, the university's director of international development on the £10,000 trip to New York . Work on Pontio is currently running months behind schedule with the £49 million project already £12 million over budget. Terfel has previously defended the delay saying they needed 'time to get everything perfect'. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman Simon Thomas said: 'I understand that this trip was involved with Pontio. 'I would think that their resources would be better spent making sure the building work is finished on time instead of flying out to New York.' The president of Bangor's students' union, Rhys Taylor, said: 'I don't think there was any need to send staff over to New York for this trip. 'I think it's important that these decisions are discussed more openly with the rest of the university, including students and members of staff.' A university spokesman said the trip was necessary to raise more funds for the university and added it had generated £2.2 million since Mrs O'Neal took her post. Ms O'Neal has received a 'reminder' over her expenses bill ran-up between October 2013 and December 2014. A spokesman told S4C's Y Byd ar Bedwar ('The World on Four') program: 'The university has succeeded in raising £2.2m since Ms O'Neal took up her post in autumn 2013. 'Expenses connected to this job are higher than other roles within the university however, this is because it is pursuing an ambitious fundraising programme.

'We encourage our staff to get the best possible price for any item of expenditure and Ms O'Neal has been reminded of this recently. 'It is not possible to put a specific figure on how much has been raised individually by Ms O'Neal. And it is difficult to attach any single donation to a single event or visit.

"New images have emerged showing dozens of black balaclava-wearing extremists graduating from an Islamic State-run school of terror in northern Syria. Brandishing AK47 assault rifles and waving flags carrying the sinister black and white ISIS logo, the photographs showing the jihadi 'Class of 2015' are believed to have been taken in Raqqa city. Although the are dressed in head-to-toe black  and wear balaclavas that cover most of their faces, it is clear that the majority of the graduates are teenagers who have been brainwashed into thinking they are holy warriors, when the reality is they will be used as little more than cannon fodder.

The images are believed to have been taken somewhere in the city of Raqqa - the eponymous capital of the province and a stronghold of the terrorists' self-declared caliphate, which covers vast swathes of land in northern Syria and western Iraq. The photographs show dozens of militants sitting on seats in what appears to be a school hall, while chilling black and banners carrying the ISIS logo are seen been waved.

Kneeling: ISIS militants listen to a senior commanda give them their final lecture before graduating . Other images in the collection show the militants clambering on to what appears to be a school bus, which will no doubt transport them to the frontline of fighting in the area outside Raqqa city. While hardened militants with experience of warfare and knowledge of battlefield strategy may be of use to ISIS, the vast majority of new recruits - especially teenagers and foreign fighters - are used as little more than cannon fodder during an assault or for suicide bomb attacks. Others are kept far from the frontline and given mundane jobs such as guards or toilet cleaners that are a far cry from propaganda images portraying ISIS membership as a life of glory and honour. The  images emerged as thousands of Syrians fled Idlib province over the weekend, fearing government reprisals a day after opposition fighters and a powerful local Al Qaeda affiliate captured the northwestern town, activists said. Idlib, with a population of around 165,000 people, is the second provincial capital to fall to the opposition after Raqqa, which is now a stronghold of the Islamic State group. Its capture by several factions led by the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front underscores the growing power of extremist groups in Syria, who now control about half the country.

Jihadis: The heavily armed military are photographed being transported to the frontlines by school bus . Militants fighting for the Islamic State have now turned their savagery on the dead, tearing down graves and smashing tombs at a cemetery in Syria. Not content with the rape and massacre of the estimated four million brutally oppressed people living under the terror group's control in  Syria and Iraq, ISIS jihadis are now victimising the dead. Claiming gravestones and tombs are a form of veneration of the dead and only distract from the worship of Allah, the heavily-armed, camouflage-wearing militants are seen happily reducing the hilltop cemetery to piles of rubble. The chilling images are believed to have been taken in the Syrian province of Raqqa and shows a hilltop cemetery overlooking what appears to be farmland. Having parked their motorcycles at the gates of the graveyard, the militants are seen inside pulling over tombstones while sympathisers stand alongside them taking photographs. The Nusra Front and Syrian rebels have controlled the countryside and towns across Idlib province since 2012, but Assad's forces had maintained their grip on Idlib city, near the border with Turkey, throughout the conflict. Now that the city is in the hands of rebels, who stormed government buildings and tore down posters of Assad, many residents fear that troops will retaliate harshly. Muayad Zurayk, an activist based in Idlib province, said via Skype that 'residents are fleeing the city to nearby villages and towns.' He added that the situation was relatively quiet in the city yesterday despite some government shelling. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, confirmed some people were fleeing the city. Also in Idlib, activists said members of a Syrian security agency killed more than a dozen detainees before withdrawing from a detention center in the city. The activists said the killings were conducted shortly before rebels took the so-called security compound in Idlib on Saturday. The Idlib Media Center showed a video of what it said were at least 12 bloodied bodies inside a room at the Military Intelligence Directorate. The Observatory said 15 men were found shot dead inside the compound. The group said 53 other detainees, including two women, were freed by the rebels in the compound. More than 220,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, which began with an Arab Spring uprising in March 2011 and turned into an insurgency following a military crackdown.","Islamic State's 'Class of 2015' were seen graduating from a school in Raqqa .

'More impressively – for a man who was memorably booed at the Paralympics – George Osborne appears to have achieved a remarkable turnaround in public opinion. 'This is no doubt helped by the fact that more voters think the economy is doing well than at any point in our tracking for this parliament.' Mr Drummond added: 'Along with David Cameron's strong approval ratings the economy, and by extension George Osborne's handling of it, is overwhelmingly the Tories' strongest asset going into the election.' However, a Survation poll carried out for The Mail on Sunday found no evidence of a 'Budget bounce', and showed Labour ahead on 34 points, the Tories on 30, Ukip on 17 and the Lib Dems on 10 per cent. According to the ICM/Telegraph Wisdom Index poll, the Tories are on course to achieve 32 per cent of the vote, one point ahead of Labour's 31 per cent.

"The names of two Missouri police commanders who resigned from their positions in the Ferguson Police Department over racist emails have been released amid the U.S. Department of Justice's  investigation into the police department. Sgt. William Mudd and Capt. Rick Henke resigned Thursday and City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty was fired Wednesday. It is unclear whether the three were recipients or senders of the 'racially biased' emails included in the 102-page civil rights report released Wednesday by the DOJ  accusing the department of illegal practices targeting African-Americans. Twitty is seen in an undated photograph smiling as Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who gunned down Michael Brown, an unarmed,  African-American teen, has his arm around her. The two are seen appearing joyful among colleagues and friends, including Ferguson Mayor James Knowles. Scroll down for video . Sgt. William Mudd (left) and Capt. Rick Henke (center) resigned from their positions Thursday and City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty (right) was fired Wednesday over racially charged emails discovered by the U.S. Justice Department during an investigation into the Ferguson Police Department . Friends: Here, Twitty is seen among friends and colleagues, standing next to Darren Wilson (center), the Ferguson officer who killed an unarmed black teen, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles appears in the photo as well (back left, wearing a green shirt) However, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Henke was associated with a 2008 email suggesting that President Barack Obama would not complete a full presidential term because a black man can't hold 'a steady job for four years.' Mudd is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a New Orleans woman was paid by 'CrimeStoppers' to terminate her pregnancy. The Justice Department highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless, appearingly tribal, women dancing, with the caption 'Michelle Obama's High School Reunion.' The report states that the emails illustrate racial, ethnic, or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the DOJ's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week. In fact, the report states, there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails, instead, the emails were forwarded along to others. *The list above is highlighted emails found in the DOJ's 102-page report on the Ferguson Police Department. The investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts. Officials say that at least one of the email recipients was among city leaders who met with DOJ officials to discuss the investigation, the Dispatch reports. The report also adds that evidence found shows not only racial bias, 'but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case.' The DOJ's civil rights investigation into the St. Louis suburb of 21,000 came after Wilson fatally shot the unarmed black teen on Aug. 9, an action that sparked nationwide protests and cast Ferguson's mostly white police force in a negative light. A grand jury did not indict Wilson for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown. Though the Justice Department found no grounds to prosecute Wilson, the case did spark suspicions into the department's practices. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the DOJ's report 'searing,' saying the investigation found the Ferguson community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be 'disproportionately harmful to African-American residents.' 'This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized,' Holder said. 'A community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents. 'A community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue.' Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said Friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the DOJ, Reuters reports. The mayor said the city has been carrying a surplus of nearly $5 million to handle expenses related to the reform. Justice: The DOJ's civil rights investigation into the St. Louis suburb of 21,000 came after a white Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson (right) fatally shot an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown (left) on Aug. 9 . Protests: The grand jury's decision not to indict the Ferguson police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast Ferguson's mostly white police force in a negative light . Knowles said that while the DOJ did highlight many things in the report that must be addressed, there are also things that are an 'over reach.' Knowles did not comment on whether Police Chief Tom Jackson would step down, Reuters reports, amid calls for the chief to do so by some community and civil rights leaders. The report highlighted the department's practices saying the city's focus on revenue greatly impacts the police department's approach to law enforcement and the role of Ferguson's municipal court. The report states: 'The Ferguson Municpal Court handles most charges brought by the FPD, and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice, or protecting the rights of the accused, but of maximizing revenue.' The department also exhibited evidence of racial stereotyping, the report states. Several Ferguson officials told the DOJ that African-American residents exhibit a lack of 'personal responsibility' which causes the group to experience harm. However, the DOJ found that though some people lack personal responsibility, -- including officers within the police department -- the reason African-Americans in the city experience 'disproportionate' harm is the result of the department's many 'systematic deficiencies.' *The list above is highlighted evidence found in the DOJ's 102-page investigation into the Ferguson Police Department based on the department's findings and research . Ferguson Police Department: The report found that some practices of the Ferguson Police Department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the Fourth Amendment . The report highlighted the fact that African-Americans make 'extraordinary' efforts to pay off overly expensive tickets for often minor,  unfairly charged violations. Court records and emails show that while African-Americans struggled to pay the expensive tickets, city officials including the Municipal Judge, the court clerk, and department supervisors helped their friends, colleagues, and even themselves in eliminating tickets, fees, fines, and citations. The report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help. The clerk responded: 'Your ticket of $200 has magically disappeared! The report does not mention Twitty by name when referring to the 'Court Clerk.' But in capitalizing 'Court Clerk,' the report appears to refer to the head clerk -- who, the report noted, is white. The report found that some practices of the Ferguson Police Department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause.","Sgt.

"Riders were left shaken after the  Cyclone at Coney Island got stuck at the top of its track forcing them to climb down to safety on opening day of the amusement park. The 24 passengers made their way slowly from around 10ft from the top of the the 88-year-old roller coaster after it stopped at about 12pm on Sunday. The riders were enjoying the first public ride during the opening of Luna Park's summer season before it malfunctioned. They were able to climb down to safety and there were no reported injuries following the incident. Scroll down for video . Riders were left stranded after the legendary Coney Island Cyclone got stuck at the top of its track during its inaugural run. Passengers on the roller coaster had to climb down to safety . The 24 passengers were evacuated by climbing down the walkway lining the 88-year-old rollercoaster after it stopped around 10ft from the top at 12pm on Sunday . Some of the passengers called the experience 'terrifying' after they safely made it to the bottom . After the roller coaster came to a halt, riders were stranded for about ten minutes before they climbed down the small walkway lining the track, according to CBS. One passenger said the entire experience was scary. 'It was terrifying, because I was up there and everything was spinning,' Gabriella Centeno said once she climbed to the bottom. 'I didn't know what to do.' A small mechanical glitch was likely the cause of the roller coaster getting stuck, said Luna Park spokeswoman Erica Hoffman. Angie Morris, the park's brand manager, said a problem like this one had not happened in a long time, and that tests were conducted on the roller coaster during the last month ahead of opening day, according to NBC. Riders were enjoying the first public ride of the 2015 season before it came to a halt and left them stranded for about ten minutes . A rider who is afraid of heights said 'it was insane' but that she made it down with the help of employees .

Another rider, who is afraid of heights, said the climb down was made easier with the help of the park's employees. Ann Dartany said: 'I'm scared of heights. But with their help I made it down. This was insane.' Prior to the two dozen passengers getting stuck, a group of dignitaries had taken a ride on the Cyclone. The roller coaster was closed while technicians repaired it and officials said they hoped it would only be shut down for a maximum of two hours. A mechanical glitch was likely the cause of the historic roller coaster stopping on its track, said Luna Park spokeswoman Erica Hoffman . The ride was closed while technicians repaired it which officials hoped would only take a couple of hours . 'The most important part obviously is that everybody was safe,' said Hoffman. During opening day, the first 100 guests were given a free ride on the Cyclone, according to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Some riders waited overnight so that they could be at the front of the line and one of the first to take part in the Cyclone's inaugural run. While thrill-seekers flocked to the amusement park in not-so-summery temperatures, it did not stop members of the Coney Island Polar Bear Club from taking a dip in the Atlantic Ocean. The group, who calls themselves the oldest winter bathing organization in the United States, went for a swim in the chilly water. And to officially set off the 2015 season with what has become a yearly ritual, Brooklyn Borough president Eric Adams broke a bottle of Egg Cream on the roller coaster.

"If you have two left feet and your dance moves are bad enough to clear the floor at a wedding reception, Google Glass may soon be able to help. A patent awarded to the tech giant this week suggests its headset could teach wearers how to dance to any kind of music. 'Shazam-like' technology would recognise a tune and suggested dance moves would be shown on the heads-up display that a user could copy. A patent rewarded to Google suggests its headset could teach wearers how dance to any kind of music. 'Shazam-like' technology would recognise a tune, and suggested dance moves would be shown on the heads up display that a user could copy (illustrated in this image from the patent) Shazam is an app that can 'listen' to songs are identify the track name and artist. The patent suggests that a wearer of the smart spectacles could watch a video of other people dancing in order to understand how the moves should look before following the instructions themselves. And it seems that instructions would show steps in real time, like those for dancing games such as Dance Dance Revolution, so users could dance along in time. In order to work, the device would have to search for appropriate dance moves to fit the beat of a song, which hints that a database of dance moves would be needed, Quartz reported. The Patent reads: ‘The content identification module may provide information associated with a content of the media sample, such as identification of the song and the dance, to the wearable computing system. The patent suggests that a wearer of the smart spectacles (stock image) could watch a video of other people dancing in order to understand how the moves should look, before following the instructions themselves . Google's chairman, Eric Schmidt, said that the company hasn't stopped working on Google Glass. It stopped selling the first generation device in January and moved research to another part of the firm. Schmidt said 'it is a big and very fundamental platform for Google,' supporting rumours that a second generation model is in the works. It is rumoured to have battery  life, sound quality and an improved display, as well as being cheaper. ‘The wearable computing system may determine dance steps corresponding to the content of the media sample and may generate a display of the dance steps on the HMD [head mounted display].’ As well as the prospect of performing some embarrassingly outlandish movements compared to those with natural rhythm, perhaps the biggest drawback with the idea is that users would have to wear the attention-grabbing spectacles on a night out. Wears of Google Glass have been already been branded glassholes. As with all patents, there is no guarantee Google will develop the idea further - although Eric Schmidt has recently said that the tech giant hasn’t given up on Glass. Google’s Chairman told The Wall Street Journal that its technology is too important to scrap, despite the fact that the firm stopped selling the controversial device in January and has closed its Explorer program. The system could risk giving users some embarrassingly outlandish movements to use on a dance floor, but seeing as it's designed to help those with two left feet (stock image), the instructions may still be an improvement overall . Glass has been moved to a stand-alone research unit and is reportedly being made ready for users. 'It is a big and very fundamental platform for Google,' Mr Schmidt said. 'We ended the Explorer program and the press conflated this into us cancelling the whole project, which isn’t true. 'Google is about taking risks and there’s nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we’re ending it.' He said that ambitious projects such as Glass and Google's self-driving car simply take time. Google is rumoured to be working on the next generation of Glass, which is expected to have better battery life, sound quality and an improved display, as well as being cheaper.","Patent suggests headset could teach people to dance to any music .

"The family of a British pilot considered missing in action for more than 70 years have finally been reunited with the ring he was wearing when his plane crashed. The plane special operation pilot Sgt John Thompson was flying crashed in Albania on October 29, 1944 whilst transporting assistance to local anti-Nazi fighters. Today, his 92-year-old sister Dorothy Webster received his ring from a family in Albania together with a box of debris from his Halifax bomber.

In 1960, Jaho Cala found Mr Thompson's finger with the ring on it at Sinoi Mountain, 25 miles north of the Albanian capital Tirana. He kept the ring and hid it at his home, afraid to show it to the then-communist authorities. Mr Cala asked his son Xhemil to look for the family of the owner, and after his father died, Xhemil contacted the embassies of the US and Britain - the two countries that helped liberate Albania from the Nazis a month after Mr Thompson's death. After three months, the British embassy confirmed the ring was Mr Thompson's and told his family. Ms Webster, a year younger than her brother, was accompanied by four of his nephews and other family members at a ceremony at the Albanian Defence Ministry today. The ring was recovered with Sgt John Thompson's finger in 1960 25 miles north of the Albanian capital Tirana . 'She was over the moon when they told us, ringing everybody,' Ms Webster's son Brian said. 'Our grandfather and grandmother never locked the house in Matlock, Derbyshire, waiting for their missed son.'

"Guilty-stricken: Rick Abath, pictured above as police found him, has spoken about his involvement in the 1990 heist from a Boston art gallery . The security guard who was duped into letting the thieves at the center of America's most notorious unsolved art crime into the Boston gallery from which they looted paintings worth $500million has spoken of his guilt. Rick Abath, who was a college drop-out working night shifts at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990, said he still feels 'horrible' about his inadvertent role in the crime, which has baffled investigators for decades. Abath was duped by two thieves in police uniform, who persuaded him to let them into the gallery, then overwhelmed him and left him in the basement covered in duct tape. He spent the next seven hours handcuffed to an electrical box alongside another guard, while the two men cut loose enormously valuable Old Masters from their frames, including works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet. The FBI has never come close to finding the paintings - despite supposedly promising leads last May - and there remains a $5million reward for information leading to their return. Abath reflected on the night of March 18, 1990, in an interview published by NPR. He said: 'They had hats, badges, they looked like cops, and I let them in...' 'Ultimately I'm the one who made the decision to buzz them in. 'It's the kind of thing most people don't have to learn to cope with. It's like doing penance. It's always there. He added: 'I don't want to be remembered for this alone. I'd like to be remembered for the good things I've done. I'm a husband, a father of two really cool kids. Scroll down for video .

Dutch Master: The thieves stole two Rembrandts . -  'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee,' left, believed to be the only . seascape the master painted, and 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black,' right . Irreplaceable: Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum . 'Dressed as cops': This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two men, who have never been caught . 'But they're saying it's half a billion worth of artwork.' In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Degas, a Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the men may have been. Missing: The Gardner museum continues to display empty frames in the spots where the paintings should be . A petty Boston criminal, who had broken into the gallery before denies having anything to do with the heist, has since said he believes his boasts to criminal associates may have sparked the crime. Louis Royce, who was a teenager in the 1980s and made it inside the gallery, told veteran crime reporter Stephen Kurkjian that he believes information he gave 'criminal associates' about the lax security may have focused the thieves' attention on the Gardner Museum. According to Kurkjian, whose recently-published book about the heist was previewed in the Washington Post, the information passed up the chain in the criminal underworld until a Boston gangster decided to make the attempt. The FBI has periodically renewed its appeal for information about the artworks, and carries information about the reward prominently on its website. Reward: The FBI has claimed to be hot on the trail of the paintings in the past - but little has emerged. Pictured above is a 2013 press conference at which a $5million reward was announced . In 2013, the bureau claimed to have made 'significant investigative progress' after figuring out that the stolen paintings had been taken to Connecticut and Philadelphia. Agents also said 'a criminal organization with a base in the Mid-Atlantic states' was responsible, and had attempted to sell the paintings in 2003. Federal prosecutors have said they would even consider immunity for those who help recover the artworks, and said they could pay the huge reward anonymously. In May 2014, the bureau made another announcement, saying there had been 'confirmed sightings' of the work - and even naming three men in connection with the crime. However, two of them, Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, are dead, and the third, Robert Gentile, denies any involvement. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the missing work. In a long piece in the Boston Globe, Gentile, a long-time criminal in his 70s who recently got out of prison, revealed that FBI agents had raided his shed hoping to find the paintings. There was nothing there, and Gentile continues to deny he ever had anything to do with the theft. The museum, meanwhile, has been displaying empty frames in place of the missing masterworks ever since the theft. It is now offering virtual tours and lectures about the work, in an effort to make up for their continued absence - though the museum's directors continue to hold out hope they will one day return.

"A British singer and her husband have been fired from their roles as judges on New Zealand’s X Factor after humiliating a contestant by launching a tirade that the show’s boss slammed as ‘completely unacceptable’. Natalia Kills, from Bradford, and her New Zealander husband Willy Moon, mocked aspiring singer Joe Irvine after he performed in a live show on Sunday. Kills, 28, accused Irvine, who sang Cry Me A River, of copying her husband’s look of gelled-back hair and a suit. Sacked: Married X Factor New Zealand judges Natalia Kills and Willy Moon have been fired after launching a tirade of abuse at contestant, Joe Irvine, on Sunday night's episode . Holding back the tears: Joe Irvine, an aspiring singer, was verbally attacked by the British singer/songwriter and her husband on live television following his rendition of Cry Me A River . She said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelgänger in our midst. 'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband. 'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?' alluding to the fact that Moon has copyright over wearing suits and gelling his hair back. She added: ‘You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious. 'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.' A shocked Irvine retorted: ‘Don’t you copy Cleopatra?’ In the spotlight: Kills accused the aspiring singer of copying her husband's look, seemingly unaware of the fact that slicked-back hair and a suit were hardly original . Double whammy: Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wifer, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates, asking him whether he dressed up in his mother's clothing . Hubris: Kills said Irvine was 'a laughing stock'. 'It's cheesy, it's disgusting', she said. But it was Kills herself and her husband that ended up being fired . You're killing me: Despite the shocking humiliation, Irvine reacted with a smile and attempted to shake the criticism off, asking Kills, 'don't you copy Cleopatra?' Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise. Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland. She told The New Zealand Herald: ‘He was a passenger in a car being driven by a woman and he became very upset when I pulled into a space before him, even though I had the right of way. ‘He got out of the car and was waving his finger at me and saying, “No, no, no.” He then snarled, “That was so rude” as we both went into the bakery.’ She said that once they were inside the bakery, with children nearby, Moon twice hissed ‘you are such a c***’. The Herald published a letter that Ms Neal-Gailer wrote to Moon in which she voiced her disgust at his insult. But Moon told the newspaper: ‘I seem to recall someone was behaving like a c*** and getting called a c***. It's as simple as that.’ In a tweet directed at The Herald he repeated the abuse and also disputed the accuracy of Ms Neal-Gailer’s letter, writing ‘not only a **** but a lying **** judging from that ""statement"" you [The Herald] saw fit to print. Laughable. Bored?’ Kills also used the C-word in a tweet to describe Ms Neal-Gailer, it was reported, in which she disputed that children had been within earshot of the swearing. She wrote: ‘Hilarious that lady is proving not only how much of a c*** she is, but also a lying c***! 'Children present'?! Where?!’ X Factor producers TV3 apologised to Ms Neal-Gailer on the pair’s behalf. Then Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wife, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates. He said: 'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd. It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.' Kills continued: 'It's absolutely disgusting... you make me sick. You have no identity... I am ashamed to be here.' Irvine appeared to take the abuse in his stride and said ‘I think I look really good’. Despite Moon having a look that resembles other more famous singers such as Mark Ronson, Olly Murs and Michael Bublé, Kills replied: ‘You look good because you're dressed as my husband.’ Both their comments were roundly booed by the audience. And fellow judge Melanie Blatt, the former All Saints singer, defended Irvine. She told him: ‘Actually, you're dressed better than her husband.’ Mark Weldon, chief executive of MediaWorks, which owns and operates TV3 - the channel that broadcasts the show - said on Monday afternoon the pair would no longer be welcome on the hit reality show. 'Last night on X Factor both Kills and Moon made comments that were completely unacceptable,' he said. 'While the judges on X Factor are expected to provide critiques of the performances, we will not tolerate such destructive tirades from any of the judges. 'Contestants put their all into this competition and they should expect to receive feedback and criticism that is professional and constructive. 'We no longer have confidence that Kills and Moon are the right people to perform the role of X Factor judges and they will leave the show, effective immediately.’ Two new judges are said to replace Moon and Kills next week, while Blatt and fellow judge Stan Walker will take over on Monday night. A Facebook group called 'Fire Natalia Kills from X Factor NZ' was created after the show, amassing over 57,500 followers, while a petition demanding the same thing gathered 74,000 signatures. Afterwards Blatt took to Twitter to slam Kills. She wrote: 'Ive tried to keep my cool and stay professional but really @nataliakills ? Sorry love , you're a t**t.' Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise. Water off a duck's back... Kills tweeted shortly after the show, seemingly unfazed by the petitions and Facebook groups calling for her to be fired . Not happy: People tweeted in their droves about their disgust at Kills and Moon's comments . Not happy: Fans aired their grievances about the insults that were hurled by the pair of judges . You're a t**t!' Fellow judge and former All Saints member Melanie Blatt attacked Kills on social media . Outraged: Blatt could no longer keep her cool and took to her own social media account to speak out about the televised humiliation . Replaced: Two new judges are said to replace Moon and Kills next week, while Blatt and fellow host Stan Walker will take over on Monday night .

"CBS correspondent Lara Logan, who was brutally sexually assaulted while reporting in Egypt in 2011, has reportedly checked into a  DC hospital for at least the fourth time this year. A close family friend of Logan's, financial pundit Ed Butowsky,confirmed to Breitbart that the 43-year-old had been hospitalized and revealed the extent of the journalism heavy hitter's suffering since the attack in Cairo's Tahrir Square. 'In spite of everything she’s had to face in the last two years, people have no idea the physical suffering she has been enduring due to the brutal sexual assault she encountered,' Mr Butowsky said. Scroll down for video . CBS News correspondent Lara Logan pictured shortly before she was sexually assaulted in Tahrir Square while she was reporting on the Egyptian protests in February 2011. She was admitted to hospital this week for the fourth time this year amid ongoing complications from the attack . Mr Butowsky told Breitbart that Logan had been in and out of the hospital since the attack, which occurred while Logan was reporting on the Arab Spring. On February 11, 2011, Logan was the victim of a 'sustained and brutal' sexual assault as she reported from Cairo on the resignation of President Mubarak. She was surrounded by a mob of 200 - 300 men after being dragged away from her TV crew in Tahrir Square, seconds after Egyptian colleagues heard men talking about wanting to take her pants off. The group  tore her clothes from her body, groped and beat her, she later told The New York Times. 'For an extended period of time, they raped me with their hands,' the reporter said and she was subjected to 'aggressive pinching'. She was rescued by a group of women and up to 20 Egyptian soldiers. Logan has since returned to the Middle East. On Sunday, 60 Minutes aired her report on the persecution of Iraqi Christians by ISIS. 'She did the story while ISIS was just four to six miles from where she was reporting,' Butowsky said. 'She did the story over the last four to six months on location in the face of ISIS all while suffering from the brutal sexual assault she suffered at the hands of evil forces at play during the Arab Spring.' CBS told Breitbart in an email: 'We were sorry to hear this morning that Lara was readmitted to the hospital. We wish her a speedy recovery.' 'In spite of everything she’s had to face in the last two years, people have no idea the physical suffering she has been enduring due to the brutal sexual assault she encountered,' Logan's family friend Ed Butowsky (pictured left) said . A handful of weeks ago, CBS released a similar statement after Logan was admitted to hospital in late February, as she suffered internal bleeding reportedly from diverticulitis--a potentially stress-related intestinal condition. The foreign affairs correspondent has digestive diverticulitis, reported Page Six. The condition could have been aggravated by stress. She was expected to remain in the hospital for several days to recover. She had since been released at least long enough to complete her report on Iraqi Christians. Diverticulitis, according to the NIH website, occurs when when pouches, called diverticula, form in the colon and then become inflamed. The last few years have not been completely kind to the South Africa native. Aside from her beating and sexual assault in 2011, she was forced in 2011 to take a seven-month leave of absence after admitting her report on the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was based on a discredited first-hand account.

Diverticula are small, bulging pouches that can form in the lining of your digestive system. They are found most often in the lower part of the large intestine (colon). Diverticula are common, especially after age 40, and seldom cause problems. Sometimes, however, one or more of the pouches become inflamed or infected. That condition is known as diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea and a marked change in your bowel habits. Mild diverticulitis can be treated with rest, changes in your diet and antibiotics. Severe or recurring diverticulitis may require surgery.","The reporter, 43, has been admitted to hospital for the fourth time this year relating to the sexual assault she suffered in 2011, a close friend said .

"A former female jail worker in Washington County, Oregon, has been sentenced to more than four years in prison for repeatedly having sex with a convicted rapist in a supply closet. Ex-Washington County Jail staffer Jill Curry, 39, cried in court on Monday as she read out a statement in which she claimed that Jang-Li Delgado Galban, a 25-year-old gang member housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, had seduced her. Judge Charles Bailey was less than convinced by Curry’s tears. 'I find that stupid and ludicrous,' he said. Ex-Washington County Jail staffer Jill Curry, 39, cried in court on Monday as she was sentenced to more than four years in prison for repeatedly having sex with an inmate in a supply closet . Curry had claimed that Jang-Li Delgado Galban, a 25-year-old gang member housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, had seduced her . Curry, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, had pleaded guilty last month to custodial sexual misconduct and other charges stemming from her contact with Delgado Galban. Authorities said the sexual misconduct occurred while a deputy was at lunch, when Curry, a civilian jail services technician, was alone in the unit's control room, reports The Oregonian. Curry pushed a button to unlock the inmate's cell and the pair would then meet in a supply closet to have sexual relations. This occurred 13 times, said prosecutor Jeff Lesowski. A probation officer who conducted a pre-sentencing investigation had recommended a prison sentence of less than two years, which the defense asked the judge to impose. Judge Bailey went above the state's recommendation and sentenced Curry to four years and two months in prison. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, 2014, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician. A probation officer who conducted a pre-sentencing investigation had recommended a prison sentence of less than two years for Curry, but Judge Charles Bailey went above the state's recommendation and sentenced Curry to four years and two months in prison . Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation. She had been working in the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center. After her arrest, Curry was booked into the Washington County Jail and held on $120,000 bond. An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her. The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped. In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again . In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release. But according to sheriff's officials, he failed to meet the conditions of the plea agreement, which landed him behind bars in the Washington County Jail where he encountered Curry. In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again.","Jill Curry, 39, cried in court on Monday as she was sentenced to four years and two months in prison for repeatedly sleeping with a sex offender .

"Animal behaviour experts had warned that this morning’s eclipse could make owls more alert, sheep feel sleepy and change the flight of moths. And while some animal lovers have taken to Twitter to describe how their cat ‘went nuts’ or dog looked confused, some say pets and farm animals didn’t react at all to the astronomical phenomenon. The partial eclipse saw skies across the UK darken at around 9.30am as the moon travelled in front of the sun, casting a shadow over Earth. Scroll down for video . The partial eclipse saw skies across the UK darken at around 9.30am as the moon's orbit saw it travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over Earth. This image shows the partial eclipse in Penzance, Cornwall . Before the event, Dave Clarke, Head of Invertebrates at ZSL London told MailOnline: ‘A solar eclipse, especially a full eclipse, could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies - who use the light for navigation.’ While the zoo had prepared by amending the lighting slightly in Butterfly Paradise, it said that in the end, it was ‘pretty underwheming’ with no strange behaviour seen. An expert from ZSL London told MailOnline that the eclipse could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies (an owl butterfly is shown) This may be because the skies of London were grey and cloudy. The Royal Zoological Society Scotland said there was also no unusual activity at Edinburgh Zoo either. However, many people took to Twitter to say it was eerily quiet during the eclipse, with birds falling silent, as predicted. RizkeyG in Staffordshire, tweeted: ‘It went cold and dark and the wind changed. There were no birds flying, then they started to tweet again in the trees. Brilliant #eclipse’, while Robert Thompson said: ‘Eclipse is weird even though cloudy the sky has almost a lilac haze, the birds have gone and the wind has stopped eerie out there.’ Kitty Gallannaugh in London said: 'It's just kind of dusky flat light here and all the birds have gone silent. It's eerily peaceful!', to which Laura Amy replied: 'There is a hazy feel to everything, no birds flying and no wind at all! Very eerie.' Donald Broom, Emeritus Professor of Animal Welfare at the University of Cambridge, told MailOnline earlier this week that the most people would notice that many of the common birds stop singing and some may move to higher perches or more secluded spots to feel safer. 'Farm animals out in the fields might stop grazing and move to a more sheltered place as they do at night,' he said, before adding that because all animals have 24 hour body clocks, they know it is not night time but that something unusual is going on,’ he added. A Twitter user called €va said: ‘It's REALLY calm. No animals make sounds out there. It's STILL, like NATURE is holding its breath. :-) #eclipse The mood is ODD’ and Yvonneridley tweeted: ‘Animals on farm are acting a bit weird #eclipse’. The path of totality for Friday's eclipse travelled from just beneath the Greenland peninsula to the Arctic Circle. The left-hand animation shows the totality of the 1999 eclipse. The right-hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 March travelled over Europe . Professor Broom also said that pet dogs and cats would probably be 'slightly disturbed' by the eclipse and some Twitter users seem to have confirmed his theory. ‘They'll notice it will get dark,' he said before adding: 'Although night happens every day, you don't have a substantial change in light intensity in the morning, so it's a bit disturbing for them.' He predicted that dogs would probably be more alert and pay more attention to what's going on around them more than usual because they will be 'slightly surprised'. There were reports of pet dogs howling and running around on Twitter, although Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London ‘saw absolutely no changes in behaviour in our animals’. Kat Williams tweeted: ‘Did anyone else's animals get proper weird over the eclipse? Rachel [a dog] was chewing the armchair & generally acting like a little weirdo, to which Jason A Leaman replied: ‘Our hens went to bed!’ Zoos in London, Chester and Edinburgh said that animals did not behave particularly strangely during the eclipse, but these lemurs at Chester Zoo, seem to be admiring the strange sight . Professor Broom also said that pet dogs and cats would probably be 'slightly disturbed' by the eclipse and some Twitter users seem to have confirmed his theory, however, this dog waiting for the event with its eclipse glasses on, looks quite relaxed . The eclipse saw up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in London and around 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. A partial eclipse was visible across Europe, North Africa and Russia for about 90 minutes. This suggests that animals living nearer the arctic circle  reacted more strongly but this is hard to prove . Charlotte Vermeulen, a biologist at the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam told Nasa that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark, because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of ‘night-time’. For example, sheep (stock image) may find a place to sleep tomorrow . Projection: Place a pinhole or small opening in a card, and hold it between the sun and a screen – giant sheet of white paper works – a few feet away. Filters: The sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose. Such filters have a thin layer of aluminum, chromium or silver on the surfaces. Telescopes with solar filters: There are sun-specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse. However, other pet owners were underwhelmed by their animals’ response to the partial eclipse. Hand Troleman in Aberdeen, where the eclipse was meant to be more striking, tweeted: ‘Not gonna lie was expecting more from the eclipse: total darkness, folk walking into lampposts, animals howling, the end times being upon us and Pokusevski's, a deli in Salford said: ‘They say animals can feel solar eclipse. Don't think my cats are bothered,’ along with a picture of two ginger cats relaxing. Charlotte Vermeulen, a biologist at the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam told Nasa that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark, because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of ‘night time’. She said: 'Diurnal animals - those that are awake during the day - do what they usually do at night: sleep! ‘Dragonflies hide under a leaf, ants return to their nest, sheep walk back to their sleeping place, cattle egrets (heron-like birds) return to their nocturnal roost, diurnal grasshoppers chirp more slowly and then stop.’ ‘Nocturnal animals become active: owls hoot, bats fly, blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning, cocks crow, nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping, and so on.’ It was also predicted that bees may become more active during the partial eclipse, based on a study conducted in India. Experts at the Zoological Survey of India studied rock bees during an eclipse in June 1955 and found that when the sun was hidden behind the moon, 150 bees buzzed out of a hive, instead of the normal 25 or so, The Atlantic reported. ‘It would appear that during the partial solar eclipse on the 20th June, the rock bees became distinctly restless and more active,’ ML Roonwall, who led the study said. During a partial eclipse in 2001, desert cicadas in Arizona fell silent in a break from their normal calling,but there have been no reports that similar insects like crickets, did the same in the UK. Birds were reported to go silent during the partial eclipse, like the crow shown above in Bridgwater, Somerset . Many people took to Twitter to say it was eerily quiet during the eclipse, with birds falling silent, as predicted. Here, a group wear protective glasses as they watch the partial eclipse in Madrid . Experts think this may have happened because of a drop in temperature under the eclipse’s shadow and because calling takes a lot of energy, it was impossible for the insects to keep up their method of communication. In 1973, researchers found that captive squirrels became restless in the run up to and during an eclipse. In the study, the animals increased the length of this ‘non-stop running sessions’. During a 2001 solar eclipse in Africa, self-proclaimed eclipse chaser, Todd Thompson witnessed strange animal behaviour in Zambia. RizkeyG in Staffordshire, tweeted: ‘It went cold and dark and the wind changed. There were no birds flying, then they started to tweet again in the trees. Brilliant #eclipse’ A stock image of a blackbird is shown . ‘Nocturnal animals become active [during an eclipse]: Owls hoot, bats fly, blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning, cocks crow, nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping, and so on,’ one expert said . He said in a blog post that birds went to roost as the sky darkened, crickets and cicadas fell silent and even mosquitoes vanished. Paul Murdin, visiting professor of Astronomy at Liverpool John Moores University, collected observations from 250 members of Wildlife and Environment Zimbabwe (WEZ) during the same eclipse. He wrote that hippos looked nervous and alert in a river, unsure if it was dawn or dusk and once the eclipse ended, there was a ‘crescendo of loud dawn chorus-like calls’ from turtle doves, after they had fallen silent though the event. ‘By contrast frogs in the river called at totality and ceased calling when the light reappeared,’ he wrote.","Eclipse saw skies darken across the UK at around 9.30am .

"Spared jail: Amy Hickson had more than 600 indecent images of babies and children and pornographic images of animals . A woman has been spared jail despite being caught with more than 600 indecent images of babies and children and pornographic images of animals when she was just 17. Amy Hickson, now 20, of  Alresford, Hampshire, pleaded guilty at Winchester Crown Court to 13 offences which involved many of the sick images being stored as a Powerpoint presentation. She had also made Google and Youtube searches for child abuse images, the court heard. Judge Susan Evans said: 'There are babies in these images, two-year-olds, three-year-olds, four and five-year-olds. They are not all young children, but there are some very young children so it does make it very serious indeed.' She added: 'Theses children are the victims and people do not know what happens to them. But I know for sure they suffer serious physical and emotional damage from what they suffer in these appalling pictures.' The offences are made up of eight charges of making indecent photos of a child, one charge of a pseudo image of a child and two counts of possessing prohibited images of children. Hickson also pleaded guilty to two charges of possessing 16 'extreme, disgusting or obscene' pornographic images involving animals - including dogs, being abused and tortured. She was sentenced to a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. She was also ordered to carry out 200 hours community service and attend a women's group. She was also made subject of a sex offences prevention order for five years and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for 10 years - and pay £750 costs and a £100 victim surcharge. Dawn Hyland, prosecuting, said that the indecent images of children included 219 of category A seriousness, 185 at category B and 199 at category C. The prohibited images included 523 cartoon images portraying child abuse, Ms Hyland said. She explained that Hickson's computer was examined by the UK police in February 2013 after they were tipped off by the American authorities. Andrew Turton, defending, said that Hickson, who is unemployed, was 'naive and immature' for her age and that she had left her university course following the police investigation and now remains living at home with her parents. Speaking at Winchester Crown Court, above, Andrew Turton, defending, said that Hickson, who is unemployed, was 'naive and immature' for her age . He said: 'It is unusual to have someone who is a child, who is a youth, being involved with this type of offending.' He also described how she had cut and paste some of the images and added text in a 'childish' way - and the offences were committed using a computer which had been bought for her sixth form studies. He added: 'There is no suggestion that Amy Hickson is a danger to anybody - and certainly not a danger to animals, babies or children.'","Amy Hickson, 20, collected stash of sick images when she just 17 years old .

"Planets wandering through space, unattached to any star or solar system, may be much more common that previously thought, according to an expert. The planets are hard to find because, without orbiting a star, they reflect very little light. But 50 have now been found in the past 15 years, leading some to suggest they may be abundant in the universe. Ashley Yeager for Science News has explained that solo planets (artist's impression shown) could be common. This is thanks to more regions of dust and gas than we thought. Planets become 'rogue' when they are ejected or form on their own and about 50 have been found in the last 15 years . The potential for these free-floating planets to be common was discussed in an article by Ashley Yeager for Science News. Rogue planets, or interstellar planets, are planetary objects that were either formed by themselves or were ejected from a system. A brown dwarf is commonly regarded as the ‘missing link’ between stars and planets. They are too large to be classed as true planets, but too small to have ignited nuclear fusion at their cores and be classed as stars. When a celestial body first forms, its size will determine what sort of object it becomes. As a star forms from a cloud of gas, its core becomes so large that hydrogen fuses into helium. Conversely, a planet forms into a smaller sphere that is not large enough to have nuclear fusion at its core. Brown dwarfs fall somewhere in between. They are the size between a gas giant like Jupiter and a small star. Their mass, meanwhile, can be anything from 15 to 75 times the mass of Jupiter. This is not enough to sustain fusion but, owing to their size, this has led astronomers to coin brown dwarfs ‘failed stars’. As they don't emit much light it’s thought there may be many rogue brown dwarfs drifting through the galaxy waiting to be discovered. How abundant they are in the universe, though, has been the cause of some debate. But Ms Yeager explained so-called globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make them more common than thought. The number of possible planets in one such region is not known, and this depends on what the boundary between cloud density and planet formation is. ‘Globulettes are very numerous,’ Dr Thomas Haworth from the University of Cambridge told Science News. ‘Even if only a small fraction can be made to collapse, they could make a significant contribution to the population of free-floating planets.’ Rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star. Brown dwarfs, for example, are substellar objects that are not massive enough to sustain fusion, but are still more than 13 times the mass of Jupiter. The exact boundary between a giant planet and a low-mass brown dwarf is still being debated, but finding more rogue planets could shed light on this mystery. And this could indicate that there are more rogue planets than we know of in the cosmos. Yeager explained that so-called globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make them more common than first thought. However, the number of possible planets that can be found in one such region  is not known. Shown is a star-forming region known as Thackeray's Globules .","Ashley Yeager for Science News explained solo planets could be common .

"A Greggs bakery based in an NHS hospital is the fast-food chain's second busiest outlet in Britain, it has been revealed. The counter at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton is often so busy selling steak bakes, bacon rolls and pizzas that ropes have to be used to separate queues of hungry customers which can reach 20 people deep. Greggs, which has flourished on the high street over the last decade and has more than 1,600 shops, would not reveal which of its outlets was the busiest. The counter at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton is often so busy selling steak bakes, bacon rolls and pizzas that ropes have to be used to separate queues of hungry customers which can reach 20 people deep . The Greggs bakery based at an NHS hospital is the fast-food chain's second busiest outlet in Britain, it has been revealed . But David Loughton, chief executive of Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals, said he had heard on good authority that the bakery at the hospital was the chain's second busiest. Mr Loughton told the Daily Star Sunday: 'There is a cafe in site that sells all healthy food but it gets nowhere near the footfall that Greggs gets. 'You can understand the appeal. It is relatively cheap.' The chain sells a range of sandwiches, pies and pasties - such as the cheese and bacon wrap, a chicken fajita slice, and beef and vegetable pasties - ranging from 300 calories to almost 600. The hospital trust has joined forces with Wolverhampton Council to tackle the obesity crisis locally. But Mr Loughton said banning the chain from the site would not solve anything. He said: 'People say ""ban the fast-food places"" but I don't think that will ever work. We have to change people's mentality regarding the food they eat.'

The chain sells a range of sandwiches, pies and pasties - such as the cheese and bacon wrap, a chicken fajita slice, and beef and vegetable pasties - ranging from 300 calories to almost 600 . New Cross is not the only NHS hospital to include a fast-food outlet. Addenbrooke's in Cambridge operates a food court with a Burger King, Costa Coffee, Starbucks and pizzeria, and University Hospital Southampton Foundation trust, also hosts a Burger King and a Costa Coffee shop. Hospital chiefs in Devon have recently told staff not to allow deliveries from a new Pizza Hut - despite it being built in their own multi-storey car park. The move was revealed a month after the chain opened just 100 yards from the walls of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. Staff were instructed to tell patients they could not order from the fast food restaurant, with bosses steering them towards 'healthier' sandwiches in the hospital's smoothie bar instead. David Loughton, chief executive of Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals, said he had heard on good authority that the bakery at the hospital was the chain's second busiest . A hospital in Surrey has also come under heavy fire when it emerged it had paid £24,000 to close a Burger King branch inside its own walls. Croydon University Hospital had hosted the fast food chain in its entrance for 14 years, sparking the ire of health campaigners. It finally managed to close the outlet - which was next to posters promoting healthy eating - in 2011 and replace it with a Costa Coffee branch. But in order to terminate the contract it had to pay £24,000 to Compass UK, the company operating the fast food franchise. Croydon Health Service admitted the 'world had changed' since it signed the original deal in 1997.","The counter at New Cross Hospital, in Wolverhampton, is often 20 people deep as it is busy selling steak bakes, bacon rolls and pizzas to patients .

"Anne Dobson, 39, was jailed for two years and four months after stealing money from the families of three residents at the care home where she worked . A conwoman who used her job working at a care home to steal £116,000 from the families of vulnerable residents used it to pay for a lifestyle she could not afford. Anne Dobson, 39, splashed £20,000 on a wedding ceremony, another £4,000 on the honeymoon, and bought herself a new car worth £16,000. She tricked the families of three residents of Broomfield Grange Care Home, Essex, into paying their monthly bill of around £1,200 directly into her bank account. She then passed the money on to her employer Embrace All Care Homes, but not before taking £400 from each bill for herself. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that she began taking the funds in order to pay down debts she had racked up, but soon went on a spending spree than included a £1,000 holiday. Andrew Jackson, QC, prosecuting, said: 'In 2013 she was marrying again and needed to pay for her wedding and she could not afford the sort of wedding she wanted so continued to defraud the company. 'She paid for her own wedding which she told police had cost about £20,000 and on top of that a honeymoon to the tune of £4,000, all of which were funded by the ongoing fraud. 'By 2013 she was on top of her debts and she freely admitted that it was to pay for the wedding.' The 'simple' scheme worked like clockwork each month, the court was told, until one of the residents' families thought to question the amounts being paid. When interviewed by police, Dobson admitted her actions, telling officers she felt 'crap' for what she had done. At one stage the mum from Witham, Essex, even wrote a £7,000 cheque to one resident in a bid to relieve her of her burden of guilt. Mr Jackson added: 'It was a gross breach of the trust that the company placed in her. 'She played a leading role - she was the author of this fraud - there was an abuse of her position of trust and responsibility.' Miss Penny Summers, mitigating, said Dobson was 'absolutely and thoroughly ashamed of herself' and had yet to tell her children of her actions. She said: 'In the beginning, she was in financial difficulties - however she explained to me that there was no excuse for it ongoing. Dobson (right) gave her personal bank details to three families, collected their monthly bills, skimmed £800 off for herself, then paid the rest to her employer. She then spent some of the money on a £20,000 wedding . Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Dobson also paid £4,000 for a honeymoon, £16,000 for a car, and another £1,000 on a holiday. She also used the money to pay off debts . 'The money was used to pay for her wedding and honeymoon.' Dobson, who wore a black jacket and scarf, black skirt and knee-high black boots, sat with her head bowed in the dock listening to the evidence. She sobbed as she was sentenced. Sentencing her to two years and four months in jail, Recorder Mark Ockelton, told her: 'You were not in debt at the time - it was committed in order to give you a lifestyle of the sort you thought you ought to have. '£20,000 on a wedding, another £4,000 on a honeymoon, then you bought a new car for £16,000 and spent £1,300 on holiday and that still leaves tens of thousands of pounds unaccounted for.' A proceeds of crime hearing will take place later this year in order to try to recoup some of the missing money. Dobson had joined the Embrace care company as a receptionist before being promoted to the role of administrator - a role which gave her access to residents personal files. Mr Jackson said: 'It became plain that she has been syphoning considerable amounts of money. 'Her role was to update the company head office with regards to what residents or patients would be paying for care - that amounts having been agree with the residents and the care home. 'Once the fee for the care has been agreed, what should happened, by direct debit or standing order, the resident would pay weekly or monthly the required amount direct to the care home.' Dobson admitted a single charge of fraud between July 1, 2012 and July 31, 2014.","Anne Dobson, 39, gave her bank details to families of care home residents .

"Actress Meili Cady was just a small-town girl aspiring to be an actress in Los Angeles, but was lured into a life of crime by 'Pot Princess' and alleged Samsung heiress Lisette Lee, she claims in her new book. Cady, who appeared in Californication and Chick Magnet, said she became enchanted with the extravagant lifestyle of Lee - but she realized too late when she was taken into custody by DEA agents that she was apart of Lee's illegal smuggling operation into the Midwest. The book, Smoke: How a Small-Town Girl Accidentally Wound Up Smuggling Seven Tons of Marijuana with the Pot Princess of Beverly Hills, tells of how it all came raining down on Cady when she learned that Lee was transporting 500 pounds of marijuana, according to the New York Daily News. Scroll down for video . Actress Meili Cady (abve) was just a small-town girl aspiring to be an actress in Los Angeles, but was lured into a life of crime by 'Pot Princess' and alleged Samsung heiress Lisette Lee, she claims in her new book . Cady (left), who appeared in Californication and Chick Magnet, said she became enchanted with the extravagant lifestyle of Lee. But she realized too late when she was taken into custody by DEA agents in connection to Lee's illegal smuggling of weed into the Midwest . On a day in June 2010, the private jet her best friend had leased headed for Columbus, Ohio had 13 suitcases filled with weed. And as Lee's personal assistant, she never knew the reality behind the glamorous life of the 'Gangster Princess', as named by the Rolling Stone, was closely entangled in a web of lies and manipulation that would leave her facing 40 years in prison. It was estimated that during 14 trips made to Ohio, Lee had transported 7,000 pounds of pot and made a profit of $3million. Lee was sentenced to six years, while Cady received 30 days in custody and one year of home confinement after making a deal with prosecutors. It all began when she left Washington State at 19 years old and headed for California where she worked part-time jobs to support herself and pursued her dreams by enrolling for classes at an acting studio. A friend from the studio introduced her to Lee, an aspiring Korean pop star who dropped out of Harvard and called herself the 'Korean Paris Hilton', and though Cady was hesitant to befriend an heiress who had to seek  friends, she was lonely. And as Lee's personal assistant, she never knew the reality behind the glamorous life of the 'Gangster Princess', as named by the Rolling Stone, was closely entangled in a web of lies and manipulation that would leave her facing 40 years in prison (above Lisettee Lee, left, with Cady, right) Lee (left) was sentenced to six years, while Cady (right) received 30 days in custody and one year of home confinement after making a deal with prosecutors. It was estimated that during 14 trips made to Ohio, Lee had transported 7,000 pounds of pot and made a profit of $3million (above the 13 suitcases filled with marijuana) Following her release from prison, she spent a year under house arrest and was forced to wear an ankle monitor while confined in her apartment . Lee's Japanese father was a big player at Sony and her Korean mother was the granddaughter of the founder of Samsung - so the luxury condo she lived in along with the purple Mercedes all made sense to Cady. And when she was struggling financially, Lee offered her a job as personal assistant, as she needed the help while 'embarking on a new business venture'. While Lee was vague on the details, Cady took the job with her first assignment pretending to be a wealthy diva who was particular about the way her luggage was loaded onto the plane at the Van Nuys airport in California. Cady learned later that she was risking arrest for Lee who feared it, as she was sent on the drug-smuggling flight in her place. But on her fourth flight, when Cady (above) complained about the smell of marijuana in the cabin, she finally understood that luggage was actually filled with drugs - and that she was an accessory in a major criminal operation . But she nearly made a fatal mistake after offering to help with the suitcases on her second flight, which she was scolded for by Lee. This along with other jobs including making large wire transfers under her own name left her confused about her role as Lee's personal assistant. On her fourth flight, when she complained about the smell of marijuana in the cabin, she finally understood that luggage was actually filled with drugs - and that she was an accessory in a major criminal operation. In the book, which is out on March 24, Cady revealed that even though the truth came out, she remained silent and was arrested along with Lee in Columbus by federal agents in 2010. In the end, during the trial, Cady learned the truth - Lee had been fostered as a small child, and was the illegitimate daughter of a Samsung heiress and a Japanese father who owned casinos. Film director Craig Brewer, a Sundance winner for 2005 film Hustle and Flow, is considering making a movie based on Lee’s life.","Meili Cady tells of how a life she thought was glamorous landed her as an accessory to a major crime in new book .

"NBC News' veteran chief medical correspondent Dr Nancy Snyderman announced her departure Thursday, months after she sparked a controversy by violating a quarantine upon her return from covering the Ebola epidemic in Africa. In a statement released this morning, Snyderman, 62, said that her decision to leave NBC was partially informed by her desire to return to her medical ‘roots.’ However, she noted that the Ebola scandal also played a role in her resignation. Scroll down for video . Out: Dr Nancy Snyderman, the chief medical editor at NBC News, announced her resignation Thurasday after nine years with NBC . Scandal: Dr Snyderman agreed to a voluntary quarantine for Ebola after covering the outbreak in Liberia for NBC last fall, pictured - but she was seen getting takeout in New Jersey just a few days later . Contrite: Snyderman, pictured working in Africa, returned to Today Show in December and apologized for violating the terms of her quarantine . Rumor mill: On February 22, Snyderman appeared in a Nightly News segment about peanut allergies, in which she seemed disoriented and was tripping over her words. 'I stepped out of the OR a few years ago and it is now time for me to return to my roots, so I am stepping down from my position as Chief Medical Editor at NBC News. ‘Covering the Ebola epidemic last fall in Liberia, and then becoming part of the story upon my return to the U.S., contributed to my decision that now is the time to return to academic medicine,’ Snyderman stated. ‘I will be shortly taking up a faculty position at a major U.S. medical school. More needs to be done to communicate medicine and science to our viewers and citizens, especially in times of crisis, and with my experiences in the field and on air, that is going to be a priority for me.’ 'I stepped out of the OR a few years ago and it is now time for me to return to my roots, so I am stepping down from my position as Chief Medical Editor at NBC News.

I will be shortly taking up a faculty position at a major U.S. medical school. More needs to be done to communicate medicine and science to our viewers and citizens, especially in times of crisis, and with my experiences in the field and on air, that is going to be a priority for me. “I have loved my nine years at NBC and I am proud of the work my team has done. Very few people get the chance to combine two professions and I have appreciated the chance to inform the public about medical updates and the plight of so many in other countries. Every moment has been an honor.' In conclusion of her parting note, Snyderman said she has loved her nine years at the network and was proud of the work her team has done informing the public about the plight of people around the world. ‘Every moment has been an honor,’ she summed it up. NBC also released an anodyne statement Thursday commenting on Dr Snyderman’s abrupt departure from NBC News. ‘Throughout her career with NBC News, Dr. Nancy Snyderman has provided her expertise on countless health and medical topics that are vitally important to our audience,’ a spokesperson for the network wrote. ‘She’s been a valuable voice both on air and in our newsroom, and we wish her all the best.’ Nancy Snyderman had been reporting on the Ebola outbreak in Liberia for NBC in October at the time a cameraman who briefly worked with her, Ashoka Mukpo, came down with the deadly virus. Mukpo was transferred back to the U.S. for treatment at a Nebraska medical facility and has since recovered. Snyderman and the rest of the NBC team were urged to voluntarily quarantine themselves for a 21-day period upon their return to the United States. But during the midst of that quarantine, Snyderman and her crew were spotted getting takeout food from a New Jersey restaurant, prompting New Jersey officials to make her quarantine mandatory. Neither she nor anyone else from the network came down with Ebola. Her takeout foray angered her bosses and unleashed a bitter response online, with some viewers saying that they would have a hard time trusting her again after the mistake in judgment. NBC News President Deborah Turness told Dr Snyderman to take some time off. In early December, after spending more than a month off air, Snyderman appeared on the Today Show to apologize profusely for her blunder. Heir apparent: There is no word on who will replace Snyderman, but one possible contender could be NBC medical contributor Dr Roshini Raj, who presented a Today Show segment on Thursday . Medicine woman: Raj is a Harvard-educated gastroenterologist and internist with a medical degree from New York University School of Medicine . 'I'm very sorry for not only scaring my community and the country but adding to the confusion of the terms that came as fast and furious as the news about Ebola did,' she told Matt Lauer. 'We had already been taking our temperatures... and we knew our risks in our heads... but we did not really appreciate and - frankly were not sensitive to - how absolutely scared Americans were.' On February 22, Snyderman appeared in a Nightly News segment about peanut allergies, in which she seemed disoriented and was tripping over her words. Some NBC viewers quickly took to Twitter, wondering whether the veteran medical reporter was drunk on air. Snyderman, a surgeon and former executive at Johnson & Johnson, has been at NBC News since 2006 after spending 17 years as a medical correspondent for ABC News. There is no word at this time on who will replace Snyderman in the position of chief medical editor at NBC News, but there are a several possible candidates. On Thursday, the day of Snyderman's announcement, NBC medical contributor Dr Roshini Raj appeared in a segment about a study that says there's a link between sleep deprivation and obesity. Contender: Another possible contender for Snyderman's old job is Dr Natalie Azar, who came on the Today Show earlier this week to talk about hormone replacement therapy .

"The BBC boss who insulted nearly half the country earns an enormous salary without even working full-time, it emerged yesterday. Trying to rebut allegations of BBC elitism, £330,000-a-year Alan Yentob insisted the corporation did make programmes for C2s and DEs – a technical term for the working classes. Viewers said his comments on Newsnight were arrogant and showed he was out of touch. And yesterday the BBC had to admit that – despite commanding a salary more than twice that of the Prime Minister – Mr Yentob’s job is ‘not a contracted full-time role’. Part-time worker: Alan Yentob, pictured, is paid £183,000-a-year as the BBC's creative director, and gets a separate salary as editor and presenter of BBC programmes such as the arts series Imagine . In an embarrassing series of letters, the BBC also struggled to explain what he does as creative director, claiming it is ‘highly specialised and bespoke role unique to him’. Asked for Mr Yentob’s job description, it said that he was ‘a leading figure in the broadcast world’ but was unable to detail his duties. The 68-year old media grandee is paid one salary of £183,300 a year for his work as creative director, and another as editor and presenter of BBC programmes such as the arts series Imagine. He has refused to say exactly how much this is, but BBC insiders says it is ‘easily’ in the region of £150,000 a year, bringing his total package to around £330,000. On Wednesday Mr Yentob was wheeled out to explain the decision to sack Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear but was ridiculed for bungling his lines. Fluffed: Yentob appeared on Newsnight  to explain the decision to sack Jeremy Clarkson (pictured)  but was ridiculed for bungling his lines . He claimed Mr Clarkson had ‘already suffered’ by being dropped from the show and it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest he shouldn’t be paid until the end of his contract. Mr Yentob then said the BBC did not cater only for the metropolitan elite saying it ‘reached out to…C2s [and] DEs’ – who account for more than 46 per cent of the population. Last night, John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP from Birmingham Yardley, called for an investigation into Mr Yentob’s pay. ‘It sounds to me a lot like somebody who is a popular person within the BBC hierarchy getting a bung for just existing,’ he said. ‘There should be an inquiry into where the value for money is.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘As creative director, Alan oversees the BBC’s creative strategy across all content and services including acting as the focal point for all BBC talent management. ‘Alan has also built the BBC’s partnerships with arts and cultural organisations across the UK.’","Media grandee is paid £183,300-a-year for his role as creative director .

"Police hunting the rapist of an 18-year-old girl who was left for dead after she was dragged from a bus stop and repeatedly smashed over the head have released an e-fit of the suspect . Police hunting the rapist of an 18-year-old girl who was left for dead after she was dragged from a bus stop and repeatedly smashed over the head have released an e-fit of the suspect. The victim was waiting by the roadside in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when she was grabbed and hauled to a nearby garden and repeatedly struck with what is believed to be a large stone. The horrific attack was captured on CCTV - but police say the quality of the footage is not sufficient to identify the attacker. The young woman was left with serious head and hip injuries and rushed to hospital after the attack around 10.52pm last Friday. Now detectives investigating the attempted murder have released an e-fit image of the suspect. The Asian teenager was grabbed from behind by a man,  in his 20s and also believed to be Asian, in the Beeston Hill area of Leeds. He dragged her into a garden and raped her. She was assaulted over a considerable period of time which left her with head injuries, a possible broken hip, and lying in blood. Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The victim is making a good recovery in hospital and we are continuing to support her and work very closely with her to gain as much information as we can about the incident. 'As part of that process, we have been able to produce an e-fit image of the man from her description of him. We would ask people to look at it closely and think very carefully if it is anyone they recognise. 'The description remains of him being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, aged in his early twenties, slim, with receding black hair. He was wearing dark clothing and possibly a light blue top with a hood. The scene of the horrific attack. Police say the incident was captured on CCTV - but police say the quality of the footage is not sufficient to identify the attacker . The victim was assaulted over a considerable period of time which left her with head injuries, a possible broken hip, and lying in blood . 'We are still considering the possibility that the suspect could be somebody who is new to the area. They may be staying locally in a bedsit or hostel and I would like to hear from anyone who runs such premises who thinks they know who it might be. 'Our enquiries are ongoing and we are currently trawling the area for any CCTV footage of the suspect that could assist us in identifying him. 'The incident was captured on CCTV and it is clear there were a number of people in the area at the time, either walking down the road or getting on and off buses on either side of the road. I would like to hear from anyone who was in the area around that time. A team of specialist forensic officers spent last Saturday recovering evidence from where the girl was found . 'We are still trying to trace two potential witness - a woman who gets onto a Number One bus bound for Leeds shortly before the attack and a man with her who walks away down Beeston Road. 'We are also keen to identify the man seen running along Beeston Road and onto Parkfield Road shortly after the incident.'

"President Barack Obama's most secretive and controversial adviser isn't going anywhere, despite six years of whisper campaigns and public derision offered up by Republicans. Valerie Jarrett, the onetime aide to then-Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, was introduced to Obama by a young staffer then named Michelle Robinson. In short order she had the future leader of the free world's future plans mapped out and underway. It doesn't help her public image that she was born in Iran, albeit to American parents. Or that she's unelected and has never faced the Senate confirmation process. But American presidents have broad discretion to appoint their own advisers, and Jarrett now says she'll 'stay until the lights go off.' POWER: During a July 2014 broadcast interview with NBC, Jarrett showed off her office – including a picture frame decorated with figurines bowing to her . OBAMA-WHISPERER: Jarrett is the president's closest adviser but has never faced an election or a Senate confirmation vote . The New York Times Magazine interviewed Jarrett for a feature published on Friday, hearing her say that her relationship to Obama is nothing like the famously cozy one between former President George W. Bush and Vice Presdient Dick Cheney. 'Please don't say that. Stop right there,' she insisted. 'The president listens to people who have interesting things to say – that could be the most junior person on the staff or it could be a senior adviser or it could be a person who whispers something to him across a rope line.' There's nothing new about close advisers in the White House, not even with the spacious West Wing office Jarrett has occupied since 2009. George W. Bush had Karen Hughes. Bill Clinton had Bruce Lindsey. Ronald Reagan had Michael Deaver. Thomas Jefferson had James Madison. 'NIGHT-STALKER': Jarrett has access to both the West Wing and the upstairs presidential residence, drawing resentment from other senior staff . But a Republican congressional staffer who requested anonymity spoke frankly about Jarrett on Friday, telling Daily Mail Online that she 'is clearly Obama's Rasputin, subtlely steering the ship of state.' 'Valerie Jarrett has the kind of influence on the federal government that the Constitution was designed to prevent,' the staffer said. The New Republic once reported on quiet discussions with an unnamed former Obama administration official who explained aides' resentment of her all-hours access status with the first family – a situation that has earned her the nickname 'the night stalker.' 'It’s pretty toxic,' the official said. 'She went to whatever meeting she wanted to go to – basically all of them – and then would go and whisper to the president. Or at least everyone believed she did. ... People don’t trust the process. They think she’s a spy.' Jarrett told the Times that having Obama's ear and knowing his instincts 'initially it probably made people a little uncomfortable,' but 'I think that has faded. I just want to do my job, and part of my job for the president is to be his friend.' 'WHATEVER MEETING SHE WANTED': Jarrett reportedly has carte blanche to sit in with Obama wherever and whenever she chooses – including this February 2014 sit-down with business leaders where she sat closer to the president than former secretary of state Colin Powell . 'RASTPUTIN': A Republican congressional aide likened Jarrett to Grigori Rasputin, the mystical Russian faith healer who earned the nickname 'mad monk' as he wielded influence over Tsar Nicholas II and his wife . What hasn't faded is the Washington-wide perception that she has outsize influence. Recent books and White House interviews have fed that fire more oxygen. In his book 'Leading From Behind,' noted terrorism expert and multiple New York Times best-selling author Richard Miniter reported that the president called off – three times – a planned the Navy SEAL raid that killed al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden. It was Jarrett who persuaded him to step back each time, according to Miniter's sources. The White House later denied his account. And Ed Klein, whose book 'Blood Feud' traced the arc of a decade-long rivalry between the Obamas and the Clintons, said Wednesday on the Fox News Channel that the White House – not scheming Republicans – is behind the swirling scandal over Hillary Clinton's secret email server. Klein cited sources who told him Jarrett and Obama are jointly behind it since neither wants sto see Mrs. Clinton measuring the Oval Office's drapes. White House staffers, he told Fox News, are seeing 'tons of documents being wheeled through the corridors from Clinton’s old offices, and they’re going through these looking for problems on her expense account, on her dealings with foreign leaders.' 'All of this, I’m told, is prompted by Valerie Jarrett and the president, who do not want to see Hillary Clinton president of the United States,' Klein said. EXCUSE? Jarrett explanied away the bow-to-me photo frame on Twitter . In a profile published during Obama's first year in office, the president told The Independent that 'Valerie is one of my oldest friends. Over time, I think our relationship evolved to the point where she's like a sibling to me ... I trust her completely.' He trusts Jarrett, he said, 'to speak for me, particularly when we're dealing with delicate issues.' Obama also trusts her, it seems, to give TV interviews like the one she granted NBC News last July. Her message, though, was overshadowed by a camera shot of a framed photo of herself of a bookshelf – complete with three figurines posed bowing in homage to her image. Jarrett later fell back on a tweet claiming it was 'a gag gift.'","Valerie Jarrett helped launch the president's political career in Chicago is never far from the Obamas .

"Olivia-Grace (pictured with mother Jessica Steele-Smith), now two years old, battled though surgery and chemotherapy to beat ovarian cancer . Happy and smiling in her mother’s arms, Olivia-Grace Steele looks a picture of health. But the two-year-old is one of the youngest ovarian cancer sufferers and has battled through surgery and chemotherapy. She first showed symptoms at ten days old but it was not until she was four months old that doctors realised what was wrong. Her mother Jessica Steele-Smith, of Oxford, said: ‘Call it mother’s instinct, but I felt very strongly for months that there was something wrong with Olivia-Grace. ‘I had spoken to medical professionals at least ten times because of her large belly and because she couldn’t keep her milk down. I was dismissed as an overanxious first-time mother.’ Mrs Steele-Smith and husband Jake Smith, a nuclear energy development worker, grew more worried as doctors diagnosed their daughter with everything from constipation to colic. They finally found the true cause of her problems when they took her to Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital where doctors found her stomach swollen with more than a litre of fluid. An ultrasound scan revealed a 10cm mass on her right ovary, which was a rare cancerous juvenile granulosa cell tumour. Mrs Steele-Smith, 26, said: ‘We felt awful. Far from being a cute pot belly, the fluid had been building up because of the tumour. ‘The consultants seemed to know what they were looking for immediately. ‘We were stunned to be told our baby had ovarian cancer because you tend to consider it a disease that only affects older ladies.’ Three days later on February 14, 2013, Olivia-Grace underwent an operation, which lasted for three hours, to remove the tumour. A picture of health: While Olivia-Grace looked like your average, bouncing baby, she had a rare cancerous juvenile granulosa cell tumour . Following surgery and chemotherapy, Olivia-Grace's cancer was shown to be in remission by her first birthday . Following the surgery she needed three weeks of chemotherapy, which caused her to lose all of her blonde hair. But the treatment worked, and in August of that year scans showed that the cancer was in remission – all before Olivia-Grace’s first birthday. And, when her delighted parents married in September last year, she was well enough to be one of the bridesmaids.","Olivia-Grace first started showing symptoms when she was ten days old .

"A businessman who was wrongly issued with a £15,000 phone bill by Vodafone only managed to get it cancelled by staging a three-hour sit-in at the firm's headquarters. Edward Martin was sent the enormous invoice after the mobile phone company put him on a new tariff, but after eight hours on the phone he was unable to get them to admit their mistake. Eventually, he was forced to go and camp outside the multinational firm's headquarters - and they were so desperate to make him go away that they caved in and cancelled the bill. Victory: Edward Martin managed to get a £15,000 phone bill cancelled by protesting at Vodafone's head office . Mr Martin, 52, who runs a clothing business in Tiverton, Devon, said that his troubles started when he was put on a new package and told his bill would be recalculated. Vodafone then sent him a series of inflated bills adding up to £14,949.41 - without explaining why he suddenly had to pay more. 'I have been a Vodafone customer for 21 years with no trouble,' he said. 'But in December they called me to say they had made a mistake and they would recalculate my bill. 'But they never called me back and never let me know in writing what my new tariff was. All they want is for me to pay up but I'm not going to because they have made a mistake, not me. 'I haven't used any more text or data than I did before I went into the Exeter store to get a new deal. I really don't understand what has changed.' Proactive: Mr Martin had been unable to resolve the situation by phoning customer services . He repeatedly tried to phone the company to discuss the error, but was unable to rectify the situation. 'I must have spent eight hours on the phone to them being transferred to India, then Johannesburg, then onto Egypt and back to South Africa,' Mr Martin said. 'On one occasion I waited 27 minutes to speak with someone who told me they would call me back but they never did. That's just basic disregard for their customers.' The businessman finally decided to take drastic action, and yesterday he drove two hours from his home to the firm's head office in Newbury, Berkshire. Staff there initially said it would take three days to resolve the problem - but when Mr Martin refused to leave the premises, they dealt with his issue immediately. HQ: Vodafone's global headquarters are situated in Newbury, Berkshire, two hours from Mr Martin's home . He said: 'All seven car parks were full so I parked at the very front of the building, ignoring protestations from the security guys, and marched into reception. 'I was directed to the retail shop in the foyer - the shop staff were apparently highly trained in ""problem resolution"". 'The techie guy I spoke to made calls to various teams and one hour later appeared to tell me it would be sorted on Friday. 'I said this was unacceptable and I feared they were just giving me the run-around like they've been doing for the past four months. 'I thought nothing would be resolved by Friday so I told him I would wait there until then. He told me I could not do that so I sat firmly on a chair and told him to call security. 'He disappeared to the office and one hour later the headquarters store assistant manager appeared and told me that the whole bill would be cleared immediately. 'About 15 minutes later I was on my way with a letter confirming that my overcharge had been cleared and a copy of my correct contract. 'They have apologised and have launched an investigation, but they could have done a lot of damage to other people and businesses.' A Vodafone spokesman said that an 'internal communication error' was to blame for Mr Martin's enormous bill, and confirmed it has now been wiped clean.","Businessman Edward Martin was sent the enormous bill by Vodafone after he switched to a different tariff .

"Former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson is expected to go head to head with his possible replacement Chris Evans as the two bid on items in the UK's largest private car collection. After recently discovering he may have a little more time on his hands, Clarkson is said to be among motoring enthusiasts that will bid on items in the collection of 150 cars, 60 motorbikes, a gyrocopter and even a Soviet rocket launcher. Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans could also be bidding on the massive collection. Scroll down for video . A Riley 2.5, Registration: NRR 712 from 1953 - The diverse collection of cars fills eight halls and comprises of almost 150 vehicles . A Ford Fairline 500 Skyline, registration: VSU 508, from 1958. The 5800cc first arrived in the UK in 1989 . A Jowett, registriation: CPC 34 - this 30s classic was first registered in the UK on the 1st January 1935. The oldest car put up for auction dates back to the 1920s with the newest a Citroen 2CV from 1986 . While the disc jockey has emphatically ruled out taking the helm of Top Gear, there may be little love lost between the two presenters. Puncturing rumours he had been offered the top job on the BBC cash-cow, Evans did say he saw no reason the popular motoring show should not carry on without Clarkson. Evans said Clarkson's co-presenters James May  and Richard Hammond had more than enough charisma to carry the show on their own. May is believed to have been in talks with the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob but also appeared recently online in videos he posted of himself playing the recorder, alongside mundane tweets using the hashtag #stillunemployed. Clarkson, Evans and 2,000 other motoring enthusiasts will be bidding on the auction of, among other lots, the collection's most sought after item, an Aston Martin Lagonda. Amid the Army tanks, fire engines, old buses and more than 60 vintage motorbikes also being put up for sale there is also a lot of interest in an East German Trabant, reputedly the worst car ever made. The collection, which fills eight halls at a museum, belonged to the late green house entrepreneur John Saunders.

This car was road tested at Brands Hatch to a speed of 105mph. A 748cc, the cars were made for about 4 years, with about 2000 produced . Auctioneer James Dennison said: 'For anyone who likes Top Gear - this is their ultimate playground.' 'It is the most amazing collection - there's something here for everyone who likes cars. 'But there's also Rolls Royce jet turbine engine, an original gypsy Romany caravan and a replica of Stevenson's rocket. There will be no reserve on any of the lots, Dennison explained, adding that it really is a case of 'everything must go'. With a little more time on his hands, Clarkson (left) is said to be among motoring enthusiasts that will bid on items in the collection. Evans (right) said Clarkson's co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond had more than enough charisma to carry Top Gear on their own . John Saunder's son Chris, 61, said Clarkson was likely to attend 'There is a lot here to get Top Gear fans excited - I wouldn't be surprised if Jeremy Clarkson is at the auction.' He added: 'My dad loved every one of the pieces in his museum. 'It started with just one car but became what we believe is the largest private collection of automobiles in the country.

'My dad was fascinated by all sorts of weird and wonderful things. 'I remember telling him that a lot of Soviet military hardware was being sold off in the nineties and I came home to see a 40ft rocket launcher had been added to his collection. The museum is to close after Mr Saunders died two years ago and because the lease is due up on the museum site. A Rolls Royce jet turbine engine is up for auction. The collector stopped short of actually getting the jet . 'We have spent many happy years amassing the collection but the care and maintenance of the vehicles was getting a bit much. 'The number of visitors has fallen but ironically as soon as we announced we are closing we have been busier than ever.' The value of the entire Sanders collection is expected to run into several million pounds although the family say they have not sat down and put an overall value on it. The oldest car put up for auction dates back to the 1920s with the newest is a Citroen 2CV from 1986. The collection will be sold over three separate auction days in April, May and June . A replica of Stephenson's Rocket, similar to the one that will be auctioned off - the owner had two and one is not for sale .

"A father-of-three who claims he has spent 53 years living in Britain is facing deportation back to the U.S after being caught up in an immigration crackdown. Robert Carl Jordan was born in the U.S to an American soldier and a so-called 'GI Bride' - one of thousands of British women who crossed the Atlantic to marry soldiers during the Second World War. But when his parents split up when he was aged three, Mr Jordan moved back to Manchester with his mother. Robert Carl Jordan who claims he has spent 53 years living in Britain - including paying taxes and starting a family - is facing deportation back to the U.S after being caught up in an immigration crackdown . The 56-year-old, who lives close to his elderly mother in Haughton Green, Tameside, says he then set up a life for himself in the UK, which involved attending school, paying taxes and working for four decades. He also married a British woman with whom he had three children. But, since arriving in 1963, neither he nor his mother has ever sought to obtain British citizenship for Mr Jordan, believing he was entitled to stay in the country on account of his mother's nationality. In fact, those who are born to British parents outside of the UK are not automatically given a permanent right to remain - and he should have applied for citizenship. Now, the Government has decided Mr Jordan should be deported from the UK because he does not have the correct paperwork to allow him to stay. Mr Jordan, who has until April 6 to appeal the decision, said: 'I thought it would be all right because I've been married here, I've got three kids and all my family are here. I didn't think it was going to get this serious.' The former railway guard and Royal Mail postman claims he did not know anything about applying for citizenship until immigration officers turned up at the pub where he worked just before Christmas. The father-of-three, pictured with his son Matthew and daughter Chloe, has until April 6 to appeal Government's decision to send him back to the U.S because he does not have the right paperwork . After receiving an anonymous tip-off about Mr Jordan's situation, officials arrested him for working illegally in the UK. He was then released on the condition that he reports regularly to an immigration centre in Salford. Many Europeans who have been in similar situations to Mr Jordan have managed to stay in the UK due to their right to private and family life, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2011, Amir Beheshti, from Iran - who had been trying to get refugee status for seven years but had the claim repeatedly turned down - was allowed to stay in the UK because he said he had a private life that involves going for work-outs with his friends. The 40-year-old's lawyers argued his human rights would be violated if he was deported because he had become 'well integrated' in the Glasgow community. The controversial legal ruling by Scotland’s Court of Session meant the threat of deportation has been removed and Beheshti is free to remain in Scotland indefinitely. Beheshti’s claim, it said, was ‘based on Article 8 ECHR and, in particular, on the fact that he had, so he claimed, established a private life in the UK. Earlier this month, Branko Loncar, 55 - who won asylum by claiming he fled Croatia due to anti-Serb discrimination - was allowed to stay in the UK, despite being convicted of killing his wife. Since being convicted of the crime in his absence during a retrial in 2000, Croatia had asked for Loncar's extradition from UK - but his lawyers fought move . They argued that he had right to family life with his new Serbian partner in the UK - despite the pair living hundreds of miles away from one another. In the meantime, Loncar continued claiming benefits and was convicted of common assault in the UK. But the High Court still ruled that it would be 'oppressive' to send Loncar back after so long. But Mr Johnson, who is a father to Nicky, 30, Matthew, 20, and Chloe, 15, has now been told to leave the country. The Home Office says Mr Johnson was told he needed to apply for residency in 2007 after being granted a visitor's visa following a two-month holiday away from the UK. But officials said he has failed to provide evidence of long term residency in the country - evidence which would usually come in the form of medical history, tax contributions and evidence of education. Mr Jordan, who has now split from his wife, says he cannot bear the thought of being forced to leave and having to say goodbye to his children. He said: 'I have lived here all my life. I went to school here, I've worked here for 40 years. 'But now I've been told I've been working illegally all that time, even though I've got a National Insurance number and paid my taxes. 'I've not been sleeping or eating. Every time I see my daughter she cries and that sets me off.' Many Europeans who have been in similar situations to Mr Jordan have managed to stay in the UK due to their right to private and family life, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Thousands have now signed an online petition requesting he be allowed to say. It reads: 'Carl has a close relationship with his children, who are, in the least to say, devastated by this turn of events, especially his daughter, the youngest child. Carl's elderly Mother is also reliant upon him and would therefore be left without the help and care she currently gets from her Son.' Denton MP Andrew Gwynne is also backing his campaign and has asked the government to grant Mr Jordan discretionary leave while he applies for dual nationality. Mr Gwynne said: 'My office has asked the immigration minister to grant discretionary leave for Mr Jordan to remain... while he applies for dual nationality, which he has the right to do because his mother is British. 'I am fully supportive of Mr Jordan. I do feel that he should be given the right to stay.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'People born overseas to a British parent do not gain an automatic right to long term residency in the UK, and the onus is on the individual to ensure their immigration status is free of time restrictions. 'Mr Jordan was told in 2007 of the need to formalise his stay in the UK by providing evidence to support his claim of long term residency. He was also advised in writing on three occasions what level of evidence is required but he has still failed to provide it.'","Carl Jordan, 56, was born in U.S. to American soldier and British mother .

"Anti-police: Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee with a woman believed to be his wife . Great orator, reads a glowing reference from one of lawyer Tasnime Akunjee’s appreciative former clients. The testimonial is included on Mr Akunjee’s CV on a professional networking site; the person who wrote it is named, so it’s not made up. But the identity of the individual in question is something we shall come back to because it tells us rather a lot about this silver-tongued solicitor. In any event, Mr Akunjee’s skills as an ‘orator’, for want of a better word, have been much in evidence on the national stage recently. You might have heard Mr Akunjee in full flow on the radio or caught a glimpse of him on the evening news earlier this month in his (very lawyerly) charcoal-grey, three-piece suit and swish purple silk tie. What he had to say was certainly splashed across the papers. Mr Akunjee, 37, was giving evidence to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee with his latest clients: the families of the three girls from Tower Hamlets, East London, who fled the UK to join Islamic State. Mr Akunjee denounced the authorities for allowing Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15‑year-olds Shamima Begum and Amira Abase to leave Britain and reach Syria after going missing in December. He castigated the police for failing to inform their parents that a school friend had vanished in similar circumstances a few weeks earlier. And he demanded — and got — a grovelling apology from the country’s top police officer for the ‘mistake’ that, in the eyes of most neutral observers, probably had little or no bearing on what happened to the youngsters. ‘Relations can be built after they have broken down only after an apology,’ Mr Akunjee insisted loftily. The audacity takes your breath away. For we now know that the father of Amira Abase, one of the missing schoolgirl ‘jihadi brides’, is himself a supporter of militant Islam. Images posted online show Abase Hussen taking part in a notorious Islamist rally back in September 2012 in London, when flags of Israel and the U.S. were burned. Also in attendance that day was hate preacher Anjem Choudary, as well as Michael Adebowale, one of the two Muslim converts who went on to murder soldier Lee Rigby. Abase Hussen could not have found a more suitable lawyer to front the families’ anti-police campaign. Abase Hussen (circled right), whose daughter fled the UK last month to join ISIS, was pictured at an Islamic protest alongside Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale (circled left) Vicious: In 2012, Abase Hussen (left) marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London, taking part in the burning of an American flag . Tasnime Akunjee has gone on record in the past to declare that no Muslim should co-operate with the British police force because the Government’s Prevent counter-terror policy is ‘straightforward, paid-for spying on the community’. He once asked in an internet rant: ‘Does she [Home Secretary Theresa May] have Nazi blood in her veins?’ Imagine the furore if someone had insulted a Muslim leader in the same vein. The wider public might not have heard of Mr Akunjee until now but behind his self-righteous performance in the Commons, behind his fancy legal credentials, behind his respectable upbringing (his father and two younger brothers are all doctors), is an individual with links to what some might describe as the ‘who’s who’ of Islamic extremists in Britain. Consider, to begin with, a cartoon posted on his Facebook page on January 12, less than a week after the Charlie Hebdo atrocity in Paris. It depicted murdered editor Stephane Charbonnier blowing himself up by detonating a suicide vest comprising of rolled-up copies of the magazine which resembled sticks of dynamite, the clear implication being that the journalist was to blame for his own death and those of nine colleagues for frequently publishing satires about the prophet Mohammed. That message reinforced a previous Facebook entry on the day of the Paris attack itself. ‘Please don’t REPEATEDLY poke a sleeping bear,’ wrote Mr Akunjee, ‘then cry when it bites “your head off,” parce que ce est vraiment tres stupide [French for ‘because that is really very stupid].’ Could there be a more inappropriate way of behaving, given his profession? Mr Akunjee (right), 37, gave evidence to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee alongside Mr Hussen and his family . Mr Akunjee’s father arrived in this country from Bangladesh in the Seventies. He runs a GP surgery with his two other sons in Haringey, North London. Mr Akunjee’s nauseating performance before MPs closely echoed preposterous claims made by ‘human rights group’ Cage last week that MI5 was responsible for radicalising Mohammed Emwazi, the IS butcher known to the world as Jihadi John. Just a coincidence? Unlikely. In only January, Mr Akunjee — surprise, surprise — shared a platform with Cage when he argued that the UK had a ‘Jekyll and Hyde, two-tier legal system’ which was ‘a breeding ground for fascism’. Mr Akunjee said Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebolajo was 'created' by the security services . In an article carried on the Cage website, he also claimed that the security services ‘created’ Michael Adebolajo — who with Michael Adebowale killed Woolwich Fusilier Lee Rigby — by ‘making his life so difficult’. Mr Akunjee represented a close friend of Adebolajo, who was sentenced to three years for terrorist offences in 2013. And who do you think the glowing testimonial mentioned in the opening paragraph of this article was from? It was penned by someone called Abbas Iqbal, a former member of the so-called ‘Blackburn Resistance’. He served two years back in 2010 following the discovery in his home of gruesome beheading videos and an arsenal of weapons, including knives, machetes, a sword and ammunition. ‘I recommend Mr T. Akunjee for all Muslim brothers and sisters arrested under the Terrorism Act,’ he wrote. ‘He is a true and genuine friend and brother to all who meet him.’ The reference is included on Mr Akunjee’s biography on professional networking site LinkedIn. They say you can judge a person by the company he keeps. Might the same yardstick be extended to the company a person keeps online? Among his other Facebook friends are a notorious hate preacher, a former member of banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun, a one-time Guantanamo detainee, and, almost inevitably, Asim Qureshi, the leading figure in Cage, the man who for years was in regular contact with Jihadi John, to name but a few of Mr Akunjee’s unsavoury contacts. This was the man, remember, who was given a public platform in the Commons. Mr Akunjee — as the Mail has revealed in previous articles — is part of a network of extremists spreading poisonous propaganda that is turning the heads of so many young Muslims. But Mr Akunjee, like Asim Qureshi, has much for which to thank the country he despises. The solicitor is also friends on Facebook with Asim Qureshi - the leading figure in Cage who was in regular contact with Jihadi John . We now know that the father of Amira Abase, one of the missing schoolgirl ‘jihadi brides’ (pictured), is himself a supporter of militant Islam . He studied law at two of its universities: he was an undergraduate at Sussex and a postgraduate at Westminster. He was at Westminster, a college with an appalling reputation for campus radicalism, in 2007/08. Mohammed Emwazi/Jihadi John was enrolled at Westminster at that time on a computer programming course, but there is nothing to suggest they knew each other. Mr Akunjee, also known as Mohammed Tasnime Akunjee, now works for Waterfords Solicitors in Brentford, West London. Radical: Amira Abase, 15, daughter of Abase Hussen, travelled to Syria with two other girls . Home is a Victorian terrace in North London, where the curtains and blinds were drawn yesterday. But he was also recently living in a flat in a block near Marble Arch, where flats typically sell for more than £1 million. Mr Akunjee is pictured in the vicinity on Facebook in the company of an attractive blonde. Asked by one friend: ‘Who is she brother?’, he replies: ‘New wife.’ When another friend commented that she was ‘without hijab’ — a veil that covers the head and chest — Mr Akunjee informs him: ‘Working on it.’ Mr Akunjee’s first marriage to a law student he met at Sussex Uni lasted less than a year. ‘In Bangladeshi culture,’ said someone who knows the family, ‘it is usually the groom’s mother who finds the wife. She [Tasnime’s mother] was not happy that he married so quickly and divorced so quickly.’ But his career has gone from strength to strength. His latest case was given star billing at his law practice. The firm’s rolling Twitter feed repeated three tweets; all refer to the missing schoolgirls from Tower Hamlets in Syria and mentioning Mr Akunjee as having ‘conduct of the case of the three girls’. How Mr Akunjee, who is based on the other side of London, came to be representing the families or why they should need a lawyer in the first place is not clear. However, the families’ decision to effectively absolve themselves of any responsibility for the disappearance of their daughters, and scapegoat the police instead, has left them facing a backlash of criticism. Senior figures, led by David Cameron, insisted parents must take responsibility to help stop the spreading of militant beliefs. Not in the eyes of Tasnime Akunjee, who once claimed that even a shop assistant who ‘sold a terrorist a toothbrush in Boots’ would be guilty of aiding and abetting terrorism under terror laws. In a recent video on an extremist YouTube channel, he also denied that those who call for the death of British soldiers should be defined as extremist because ‘I think it is actually a soldier’s job to die’. Mr Akunjee’s views are shared by others in his online community. Aren’t they, and not the police, the ones who are really driving so many young British Muslims into the hands of IS?","Tasnime Akunjee blamed authorities for allowing jihadi schoolgirl to flee .

"A hairdresser claims obese workers ruined her business and lost her clients by prioritising food over customers. Zena Claire claims three former staff at her salon in Barnsley, south Yorkshire, were obese and faked appointments so they could sneak out to get takeaways. They also turned up eating a McDonald's when they should have been starting their shift. The 42-year-old mother of two said the three obese girls she employed caused her to lose clients and will make her think twice about employing severely overweight people in future. A salon owner said obese employees ruined her business after they booked in fake clients so they could go out on breaks or finish early to eat takeaways, or brought in fast food to eat before they started work . She said: 'It had a massive impact on my business. 'They were going to eat food rather than looking after clients. They were pretending to book clients in, having extended breaks and finishing early to go to the chippy.' Ms Claire estimates the three workers would book up to five fake appointments a week, costing her a considerable amount of money in lost bookings. She said when the non-existent clients did not turn up they could use the time to do nothing, or go out and get a KFC. She said they also brought in a McDonald's, which they would eat in the staff room at the start of the day - often cutting up to 40 minutes into their shifts. She told the Sun: 'One day five packs of caramel biscuits I'd left out were eaten all at once, along with two litres of orange juice.' 'I lost clients and product sales all because they prioritised food over work,' she added. The hairdresser said she will not ban obese people working for her in future because she will offer everyone an equal chance but the experience has made her think twice as she must base her decision on 'production value.' She claimed the girls were not attentive to clients and their lives 'revolved around food.' Experts said the difficulty in getting a job if you are obese is quite prevalent among overweight people . About one in every four adults in the UK are classed as obese, and it is known that larger people often face obstacles in getting jobs. Tam Fry, director of the National Obesity Forum, said: 'Unfortunately it is quite prevalent that if you are overweight or fat and you are in a position where the public sees you or you are an ambassador of the establishment then there's a huge tendency not to give a job to anybody who isn't regarded by society as being as 'perfect' as possible. 'Also there are many jobs where being overweight actually could be a real problem at times of emergency. 'It's a truism to say that if you are fat, fat in the sense of just appearing to be fat, that's going to work against you. That's a very big wake-up call for young people to take a grip on themselves.' Ms Claire claims her three workers would book fake appointments so they could go out to get takeaways . Mr Fry said the question of obese workers was a difficult one in the beauty industry because if a person can do a job not allowing them to do so because of their weight is discrimination. However he said image is an important factor in the beauty industry, and any issues the employer has with their work must also be taken into consideration. Last year a survey of HR and recruitment professionals in America found that half of employers find obesity to be an undesirable trait. The study by researchers from Virginia Tech and the University at Buffalo found that when faced with the option of two candidates with identical qualities - the only difference being that one is obese - more than half of respondents said they would prefer to hire the candidate with a more healthy weight. Nearly 1million people in the UK are classed as morbidly obese, and thousands of adults are believed to get Disability Living Allowance because they are unable to work because of their size.","Zena Claire said she employed three obese women at her hairdressers .

"With nothing but her dog Garrick to her name, strong-willed servant Demelza convinced her master, Captain Poldark, to tie the knot after just one night of passion in the popular new BBC series. But research shows that marriage in the 18th century was actually a mercenary affair in the vast majority of cases which saw many men marry to get their hands on a woman's wealth. Anne Laurence, a historian with Open University, has found that pragmatic marriages made for the preservation or the transfer of wealth became more important during the Poldark era. Her study is based on around 400 marriage announcements in London newspapers when it was common to refer to a bride's wealth, according to The Observer. Scroll down for video . Strong-willed servant Demelza convinced her master, Captain Poldark, to tie the knot after just one night of passion in the popular new BBC series . The fortunes of the brides were routinely given either in thousands of pounds or described as 'large', 'ample', 'considerable' or 'handsome'. In almost two thirds of the announcements studied, the bride's fortune, ranged from £1,000 to more than £20,000. But the wealth of the grooms was rarely mentioned. Ms Laurence said: 'Mercenary marriages became the subject of much criticism, but it would seem that the zeitgeist was against the moralists. 'Western sensibilities react against the idea that marriage might be for reasons other than love of a partner and a desire to spend the rest of one's life with them. But research shows that marriage in the 18th century was actually a mercenary affair in the vast majority of cases, pictured is Aidan Turner as Captain Poldark and  Eleanor Tomlinson as Demelza . The wealth of the grooms was rarely, if ever, mentioned in the 400 marriage announcements studied . 'We recognise no one has to get married to survive. At the same time, the very rich make prenuptial agreements and ever-larger divorce settlements make the news weekly. 'The preservation of a fortune concentrates the mind on pragmatic considerations.' She gave an example of one of the marriage announcement's which said: 'On Tuesday last Gilbert Burton, Esq; eldest son to George Burton, Esq; was married at Foot's Cray near Eltham in Kent, to Miss Craddock, only daughter to Mr Craddock, late an eminent goldsmith in Lombard Street, a beautiful young lady with a fortune of £10,000.' Her study is to be presented at the annual conference of the Economic History Society. A guide was published in 1742 to help men locate wealthy widows and spinsters. More than 400 wealthy woman were listed in 'A Master Key to the Rich Ladies Treasury: the Widower and Batchelor's Directory' including their reputed fortune and  stock market investments. The anonymous author cast his net wide: several of the women were in their 70s and 80s.","Study has revealed that marriage in the 18th century was  a mercenary affair .

"Islamic State militants have bulldozed an ancient Iraqi city using heavy military vehicles in the latest attack on the country's historical heritage. The jihadists are said to have gone on the rampage in the city of Nimrud in northern Iraq and even smashed up 3,000 year-old winged statues that are placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. The attack comes just days after ISIS extremists targeted a museum in Mosul by using power drills and sledgehammers to destroy artefacts, sparking global outrage. Scroll down for video . The ancient Iraqi city of Nimrud in northern Iraq pictured before it was bulldozed by ISIS militants using military vehicles . The jihadists are said to have even smashed up 3,000 year-old winged statues that are placed at the gates of the palace of Ashurnasirpal . A statement from Iraq's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities didn't elaborate on the extent of the damage. However, they added that ISIS 'continues to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity.' The ancient city of Nimrud was the second capital of Assyria, an ancient kingdom that began in 900BC, partially in present day Iraq, and became a great regional power. The city, which was destroyed in 612 BC, is located on the Tigris River, just south of Mosul, which was captured by ISIS last June. In the late 1980s the discovery of treasures in Nimrud's royal tombs was one of the 20th century's most significant archaeological finds. After Iraq was invaded in 2003, archaeologists were relieved to find the treasures had been hidden in the country's central bank inside a vault submerged in sewage water. ISIS, who control a third of Iraq and Syria, have attacked other archaeological and religious sites, claiming that they promote apostasy. Last week ISIS extremists targeted a museum in Mosul by using power drills and sledge hammers to destroy artefacts, sparking global outrage . An ISIS fanatic uses a power tool to destroy a winged-bull Assyrian protective deity at a museum in Mosul last week . Last year, the militants destroyed the Mosque of the Prophet Younis - or Jonah - and the Mosque of the Prophet Jirjis, two revered ancient shrines in Mosul. They also threatened to destroy Mosul's 850-year old Crooked Minaret, but residents surrounded the structure, preventing the militants from approaching. Iraq's national museum in Baghdad opened its doors to the public last week for the first time in 12 years in a move Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said was to defy efforts 'to destroy the heritage of mankind and Iraq's civilization.' ISIS has imposed a harsh and violent version of Islamic law in the territories it controls and has terrorised religious minorities. It has released gruesome videos online showing the beheading of captives, including captured Western journalists and aid workers. A U.S.-led coalition has been striking the group since August, and Iraqi forces launched an offensive this week to try to retake the militant-held city of Tikrit, on the main road linking Baghdad to Mosul. ISIS has imposed a harsh and violent version of Islamic law in the territories it controls and has terrorised religious minorities . Jack Green, chief curator of the Oriental Institute Museum at the University of Chicago and expert on Iraqi art, said Thursday that ISIS seems bent on destroying objects they view as idols representing religions and cultures that don't conform to their beliefs. He said: 'It's the deliberate destruction of a heritage and its images, intended to erase history and the identity of the people of Iraq, whether in the past or the present. 'And it has a major impact on the heritage of the region.' Mr Green also noted that in many of these attacks on art, pieces that can be carried away are then sold to fund ISIS, while the larger artifacts and sculptures are destroyed at the site.","ISIS has bulldozed the ancient Iraq city of Nimrud with military vehicles .

"Militant union boss Len McCluskey has warned that his activists will break the law if the Tories curb the right to strike after the election. In an extraordinary move, which was condemned by ministers, the Unite general-secretary said he was seeking to change the giant union’s constitution to authorise illegal action. Mr McCluskey, whose union has given Ed Miliband more than £14 million, said union members could not be expected to obey ‘oppressive’ laws that restrict the right to strike. Unite general-secretary Len McCluskey said he was seeking to change the giant union’s constitution to authorise illegal action . The Conservatives have said they will change the law to require unions to get the support of at least 40 per cent of their members before calling a strike. The initiative is designed to prevent union bosses ordering strikes on the basis of ballots in which only a tiny number of members have voted. Mr McCluskey said the right to strike was already ‘hanging by a thread’ as a result of union reforms carried out by the Coalition. In a move that suggests he has little confidence in a Labour victory, Mr McCluskey said Unite members would now be asked to vote to remove the words ‘so far as may be lawful’ from the rules governing the union's actions. In a speech to lawyers, Mr Cluskey said: ‘These words will go not because we are anarchists, not because we are suddenly planning a bank robbery - but because we have to ask ourselves the question, can we any longer make that commitment to, under any and all circumstances, stick within the law as it stands? Mr McCluskey, whose union has given Ed Miliband more than £14 million . ‘It is no exaggeration to say that the right to strike in this - the first country of free trade unionism - was and is hanging by a thread. ‘But should there be a Conservative majority in May, there will be a new attack on trade union rights and democracy. ‘The bar for a strike ballot will be raised to a level which hardly any MPs would get over in their own constituencies, by a government which has refused our requests to use modern, more effective balloting methods. ‘When the law is misguided, when it oppresses the people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question. I'm giving you the answer. It ain't going to happen.’ Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude condemned the move – and said it would raise further concerns Unite’s planned ‘merger’ with the PCS union. Mr Maude said: ‘Labour's biggest donor and Ed Miliband's puppet master is now advocating that their membership break the law. Ed Miliband needs to immediately condemn this outrageous proposal and refuse to take a penny more from Unite until these plans are cancelled.’ Tory MP Dominc Raab said it was ‘shocking’ for a union leader to call for illegal action – and called on Mr Miliband to disown the move. Mr Raab, who has campaigned for the introduction of minimum strike thresholds, said: ‘Red Len has never managed to persuade even a quarter of Unite members to back even one of his reckless public sector strikes since 2010, but it's still shocking to hear him preparing to break the law. Ed Miliband has taken millions from this union bully since becoming Labour leader, so if he now fails to condemn this threat of illegal strikes, it will just show the public what a weak leader he is.’ Unite activists will decide on the change of wording to the union's rules at a conference later in the year. The Labour Party declined to comment.","Unite chief  seeking change to union's rules to authorise illegal action .

"A heartwarming video has surfaced showing a flight attendant accepting her pilot boyfriend's proposal some 34,000ft in their air in front of a cabin full of passengers. Alaska Airlines flight attendant Brandy Hollenbeck's day was going like any other on the flight from Seattle to Juneau when the surprise moment unfolded. As she tended to the passengers, a familiar voice came over the tannoy as her boyfriend Eric Greener began to detail the moment the two first met. It was the perfect way to propose for pilot Eric Greener to his flight attendant girlfriend Brand Hollenbeck . Yet seemingly oblivious to this and focused on her job, Brandy continued her duties, pouring out coffee to the passengers. The Ravn Alaska pilot had sneaked onto the plane unbeknown to Ms Hollenbeck, and waited in the flight deck jump seat to spring his special surprise. Speaking to Alaska Airlines' official website, Ms Hollenbeck's close friend and fellow flight attendant RieAnn Fullwood said: 'We tried to keep her busy in the back of the plane during boarding so she wouldn't see (her boyfriend) Eric board.' Greener took the microphone to tell all on board how he had been told by his mother some time before how she had met a 'wonderful flight attendant while flying out on Alaskan Airlines'. Mr Greener gets ready to place the ring on his new fiancee as the passengers cheer and clap . Mr Greener began by recounting how the couple first met, and described it as love at first sight . He then fast forwards to three months later, when he had come across a 'beautiful flight attendant mowing down on a double cheeseburger'. He tells the passengers: 'All I could think, folks, is, my gosh, the flight attendant has got the courage to eat a cheeseburger in the terminals is a woman to know.' He speaks of how the two 'hit it off' and that he 'got her number' after meeting the woman of his dreams. Finally, while serving passengers, the flight attendant realises the love story being told over the tannoy was her very own. The announcement brought as much surprise to the passengers, as it did to Brandy Hollenbeck . 'Brandy Hollenbeck, I've loved you since the first moment I met you, and I want to be the man for you for the rest of your life,' says Greener. The pilot then springs out of his hiding place, to be greeted by an onrushing Ms Hollenbeck down the aisle, and the two embrace. The passengers cheer and applaud the loved-up couple, before Mr Greener places a ring on his fiancee and the two share a kiss. Ms Hollenbeck is thrust forward by a colleague to greet her soon-to-be husband . Just in case he wasn't sure, Mr Greener shouts, 'Will you marry me?', to which Ms Hollenbeck answers, 'Yes'. The final act is set for the delighted fiance who raises one hand in the air exclaiming, 'She said yes.' Ms Hollenbeck, quoted on the airline's website, added: 'At one point I thought, ""Someone up there is telling my love story!"" But I just kept serving coffee.'","Eric Greener takes to the PA system to propose to Brandy Hollenbeck .

As well as posing in the pretty lingerie set the petite brunette flashes some well-toned leg in denim hotpants and tailored shorts. There's even a leg-bombing shot in the campaign images by fashion photographer Matt Holyoak. Recently Emma stood down from her long-term presenting role on Celebrity Big Brother show Bit On The Side. The Channel 5 show, which the mother-of-two co-hosted with Rylan Clarke, was thought to be her career highlight until she hit the ratings big time on BBC1 show The Voice. The 'Use Your And' campaign wants to inspire women and girls to use the word AND instead of OR in order to celebrate the many different qualities that make us all unique. Emma said: 'I‘ve always believed that having many different interests, ambitions and ideas is what makes life interesting. 'Women today have the chance to try so many different things, develop their skills and of course define who they want to be more than ever. Emma showed off her killer figure this weekend in a Victoria Beckam dress on The Voice UK semi-finals which she co-hosted with Marvin Humes . 'So I’m really surprised that according to a recent study into stereotyping and labelling by Venus, a whopping 70 per cent of British women still feel held back by one-dimensional labels placed on them . 'I’m proud to partner with the brand on the new Use Your And campaign, which aims to inspire and encourage women everywhere to celebrate all the different brilliant qualities that make them unique'. Sharing her budget beauty tips with FEMAIL, Emma said: 'As a woman who is constantly on the move there is nothing more I love than a bargain beauty buy which I can pop in my handbag. I have always loved Paw Paw Ointment – it’s just one of those multi-tasking products you keep in your beauty bag which I can use on my lips, skin, even my eyelids for a little sheen. 'I also love the new Venus Snap portable razor, so cute I can just pop in the handbag so whether I’m dashing to work or to the gym; I know I can always have instant smoothness on-the-go and a feeling of confidence.' While she has made brunette pixie crop her signature, Emma revealed she may be tempted to follow in newly blonde Kim's foosteps soon. She said: 'I adore Michelle Williams’ style, she is the reason I cut my hair short in the first place! I would also love to try being platinum blonde like her, a real change from my existing shade.' Emma's new campaign has the hashtag #UseYourAnd and Venus has made a video to launch it at www.youtube.com/gillettevenus.

"A brave transgender teenager came out in front of his entire class. Tom Sosnik, 13, of Fresno, California, first read the suicide note written by Leelah Alcorn, another tragic teen who took her own life at the end of last year. He then told the students; 'I am no longer Mia. I never really was.' Scroll down for video . Tom Sosnik (above) came out as transgender to his class . Sosnik (above) told his fellow students; 'I am not Mia. I never really was' Sosnik (above with Glee star Lauren Potter) when he was Mia . The middle school student then said; 'And now I finally stand before you in my true and authentic gender identity as Tom. I stand before you as a 13-year-old boy.' Tom then detailed his struggle over the past few years, and what it took to bring him to the moment where he made this announcement. He eloquently explained his challenges, saying; 'For a while, I dismissed the fact that I hated my body. I pretended to be content with what I was assigned until, at a certain point, I broke.' Sosnik began his speech by reading the tragic suicide note of Leelah Alcorn (above) He then added; 'I went through a series of horrible breakdowns. And I would stand under the water in the shower crying. I knew I wasn't happy.' He also took some time to let other students know if they were struggling with their sexual identity or orientation, he was there for them. 'I want you to know that if no one else accepts you, I always will,' he said. If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue. Please don't be sad, it's for the better. The life I would've lived isn't worth living in… because I'm transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, and I've felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally 'boyish' things to try to fit in. When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me. My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help. When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep. I formed a sort of a 'f*** you' attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted. So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I'm surprised I didn't kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent's disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness. At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually they realized they didn't actually give a s**t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week. After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like s**t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning. There's no way out. I'm sad enough already, I don't need my life to get any worse. People say 'it gets better' but that isn't true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse. That's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a s**t which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say 'that's f***ed up' and fix it. Fix society. Please. Goodbye, .

"When her husband left her for the woman next door mum-of-four Gaynor Evans was left feeling frumpy, lonely and depressed. Fed up with staying in and watching TV on her own the 55-year-old, from Enfield, north London, started joining her single daughters on nights on the tiles  - and it wasn't long before she discovered her inner cougar. The pubs and bars were full of men in their 20s and 30s who were looking for a good time just like Gaynor, who refused to accept her sex life was over along with her 20-year marriage. Scroll down for video . Gaynor Evans found herself single when her husband left her for her friend and neighbour next door . After nervously agreeing to a first date with a man young enough to be her son in 2009 Gaynor hasn't looked back. Enjoying up to two dates a week she said she's now addicted to dating toy boys, clocking up hundreds of internet dates. What's more, after years of fad dieting, Gaynor said the energetic sex sessions she enjoys as a result has helped her shed more than two stones of flab and drop from a size 18 to 14. The recruitment manager said: 'When my husband left me I found myself sexually charged but with no one to go to. The only people I knew who were also single were my daughters, who are 37 and 36, so I went out with them. 'I started getting approached by much younger men and I was bemused at first, but then I thought why not? I just wanted to enjoy myself, still have a sex life and be free. I'm making up for lost time and it's liberating.' Gaynor on a night out with her daughter Kate, 36 (left) and on another girls night out with Laura, 37 (right) In a bid to rediscover her lost youth Gaynor wasted no time joining internet dating sites to hunt for younger men, joining specialist websites such as toyboywarehouse.com because many conventional sites don't allow more than a 15-year age gap between clients. She said: 'The youngest guy I've been out with was 20, the same age as my youngest son at the time, and I know I'm older than some of their mothers. There's a huge amount of chemistry between an older woman and a younger guy and the sex has been amazing. 'Toy boys have such stamina. I thought I knew all there is to know about sex until I started seeing younger men. 'I'm not swinging from the chandeliers or anything, but I can find myself lost. I do make a point of only seeing them only once or twice which saves me from getting too attached.' The serial dater also makes a point of not taking her men home for saucy liaisons, where her youngest son still lives. She said: 'I never tell my two boys about these things but the girls are always informed and know what I get up to. Gaynor makes a point of only seeing her toyboys 'once or twice' so she doesn't get too attached . Then and now: Gaynor has shed two stones and dropped two dress sizes since dating younger men . 'I'm a mother first and never take men home when my kids are there, which can make it hard because 95 per cent of them don't have their own places. They house share or still live with their parents so we can't go back to theirs. 'Instead I borrow my daughter's flat during the day when she's at work – she doesn't mind. I did also use my other daughter's flat once, but she wasn't so happy about it. You can always find somewhere. I duck and dive.' Despite her expert planning – Gaynor once flew a toy boy in from abroad as her youngest son flew out on holiday - she has been caught out in the past. She said: 'Once I did take a guy home and my son came back when he wasn't supposed to and found me delicately placed. It was very embarrassing.' With hundreds of internet dates under her belt Gaynor decided to self-publish Sex And The Signposts, a racy eBook charting her experiences as an unlikely cougar in August 2012. In the book she details some of her best – and worst – dates, as well as her saucy sex sessions. She said: 'I also write a blog about my antics with the same title, but I've saved the naughty stuff for the book. 'There was a hottie I met at the Ascot races who scooped me off my feet and kissed me with a passion – I'll always remember him – but other dates weren't so successful. Gaynor has also become an agony aunt for toyboywarehouse.com and regularly dishes out dating advice to younger men. 'There was a date that didn't go so well and afterwards the guy texted me rude pictures of his manhood. It was horrible. Then there was another guy whose stutter was so bad he couldn't speak at all during the date. I got one of my daughters to ring me at a staged moment and pretend there was an emergency. It was squirmingly awful.' Madonna, left, and Demi Moore, right, are both famous for dating younger men . Although she usually only allows herself to see her toyboys once or twice, there have been a couple Gaynor has fallen for. She said: 'Sometime a first date ends in a first date but there have been one or two guys I've fallen in love with. I saw one man on and off for four years but he's moved abroad now, although I'm still in touch with him. 'I feel for them in a way that is measured because I know the relationship can't go anywhere. I kick myself because I know the chance of a long relationship isn't likely – even after five years I still have that mental barrier. I often wish I was younger.' But Gaynor said there are more pros than cons when it comes to dating younger men. She said: 'There's none of the domestic drudgery you have when you're in a long term relationship and you never fall out. 'When I was younger and dating before I was married you didn't have a very big pool of men to choose from – there was no internet and you just dated people you knew where you lived. Now the world is your oyster.' 'I feel like I've had a new lease of life. I've dropped from 15 stone to 13 stone through all the sex. I never feel like eating junk food any more and I feel better than ever. 'After six months of dating toyboys I lost half a stone, and when I wasn't having sex I felt sluggish and the weight started creeping back on. Having orgasms is the best diet ever.' 'My mum, who's 91, tuts at me but we can't all be conventional. One of my daughters is always a bit disappointed in my behaviour but the other is hugely supportive and my friends just expect it now.' 'Dating toyboys has been an eye opening experience. When I found out my husband had been having an affair with our neighbour, who was also my friend, for five years I was devastated. The prospect of a lonely life was terrifying and I was scared at what awaited because as an older woman you think your life is over and you're on the scrapheap.' 'I was scared at what awaited me but what I found was amazingly good. I wish I'd found out about my husband's affair sooner. 'I've reinvented myself and now I have a fresh pool to dip my toe – or my whole body into. I'm proof you can still enjoy your life as an older single woman.'","Gaynor Evans, 55, meets younger men on nights out with her daughters .

"The family of one of the schoolgirls feared to have fled to join Islamic State discovered a handwritten shopping list of items which included tips for crossing into Syria, it emerged last night. Details of prices for flights to Turkey, visa money, coaches, hotels, taxis and other supplies were found on a diary and planner page in one of the girl’s bedrooms. It also includes sinister tips for how to slip over the Turkish border and into IS-held territory, scrawled in different handwriting at the bottom of the page. Scroll down for video . The parents of one of the three schoolgirls (pictured) from London who fled to join ISIS in Syria have found a list of essential items for their trip, including underwear, an epilator, and £1,000 plane tickets . This hand-written list shows some of the vital items the ISIS recruits needed to buy . The list of purchases, seen by The Guardian, includes a £50 epilator, two sets of £12 underwear for two girls, socks for £4 and a phone for £75. Next to each item is one of the initials of the girl’s first name, and appears to show either who was to purchase them or who they were for. Below the list of items to buy ahead of the trip is a list of the costs of reaching Turkey, and appears to be written in different handwriting. The total cost of the items, which includes £1,000 plane tickets to Turkey and appears to match with an Isis online guide for potential recruits, amounts to £2,190. The list was found in one of the girl’s bedrooms and has now been handed to police investigating the girls' disappearance. Their families of three girls - Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum - told the Guardian in an interview last week they had no idea how the girls could have raised the money for the trip. They also alleged that the police had mishandled their case, saying they were not informed that another girl from the same school had disappeared and was thought to have gone to Syria.

"A new US study may make you think twice about biting into a piece of lettuce. Scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive – and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them. The discovery was made after tests on the Arabidopsis plant  found it can distinguish between insects eating it based on the way they chew and drool. Scroll down for video . A new US study may make you think twice about biting a piece of lettuce.Scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive – and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them . 'It was no surprise that plants responded differently to having their leaves chewed by a caterpillar or sucked by an aphid,' Heidi Appel, senior research scientist University of Missouri told the Washington Post. 'What surprised us was how different plant responses were to each of the caterpillars and aphids. The plants could clearly tell insects apart - they really seem to ""know"" who's attacking.' Professor Appel exposed a group of Arabidopsis, which is part of the cabbage family, to cabbage butterfly caterpillars and beet army worms. She predicted that as the insects eat the plant, Arabidopsis could tell by the chewing motion and the drool whether the creature was a butterfly or a worm. Heidi Appel (left) and Rex Cocroft (right) previously conducted a study that found plants can identify sounds nearby, such as the sound of eating, and then react to the threats in their environment . She also believed that the plant could tell several different insects apart, even when they were eating the leaves simultaneously. To test her theory, she harvested the chewed up Arabidopsis, extracted the genes, and froze it in a laboratory. Plants attempt to defend themselves using different methods, such as giving off spicy flavours and rancid smells. These defences are expressed in their genes. Researchers in Bonn, Germany, found plants give off a gas when under 'attack'. Super-sensitive microphones picked up a 'bubbling' sound from a healthy plant. But this rose to a piercing screech when it was under threat. Even a tiny insect bite could have an effect. 'The more a plant is subjected to stress, the louder the signal,' said Dr Frank Kühnemann. Plants do not actually scream in pain. But different sounds are heard when the gas they emit, ethylene, is bombarded with lasers. The research could help to work out which pieces of fruit and vegetables are likely to stay fresh longer, as a cucumber which is starting to go off produces a squealing sound. It could then be separated from the fresher ones. Based on the gene analysis, Professor Appel found that the plant can sense when a caterpillar is drooling and provides a different defence mechanism, than if it sensed a butterfly. There were also different genetic responses to each worm, showing that the plant knew what was eating it. Professor Appel hopes that this will allow scientists to breed plants that are naturally insect resistant rather than spraying them with pesticides. The research builds on a study last year that found plants can identify sounds nearby, such as the sound of eating, and then react to the threats in their environment. In this study, caterpillars were placed on Arabidopsis. Using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant, scientists measured the movement of the leaf in response to the chewing caterpillar. Professor Appel then played back recordings of caterpillar feeding vibrations to one set of plants, but played back only silence to the other set of plants. When caterpillars later fed on both sets of plants, the researchers found that the plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils, a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars. 'What is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations, including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defences,' co-author Rex Cocroft, said. 'This indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration.'","Scientists exposed the Arabidopsis plant to caterpillars and worms .

"Police have appealed for help from the public to identify a man who was pulled near death from a shark-infested harbour by two teenage girls. The pair have been hailed as heroes after risking their own lives to jump into shark-infested waters where a man was drowning. Cousins Kelly McKay, 15, and Payge Olds, 16, were helping their friend tow his car near Burdan's Gate in Eastbourne, Wellington Harbour, at 10:30pm on Monday night when they heard a man scream for help. Without thinking, the group rushed 300m down the beach to the scene where Payge managed to undress the fastest and swim 70 metres out to sea to rescue the  man. Cousins Kelly McKay, 15 (left), and Payge Olds, 16 (right) risked their own lives on Monday night when they saved a drowning man in Wellington Harbour . 'We all thought it was a prank at first because this kind of thing doesn't really happen,' Payge, from Lower Hutt in Wellington told Daily Mail Australia. The man's cries for help were also heard by a fisherman, John Derek,  who had been fishing earlier in the evening and returned as he realised that he had dropped his cell phone and went back to find it. He saw the man floating face down in the water unconscious. Mr Derek, who was unable to swim, alerted the group to the man in the water, with the hope that one of them would be a capable swimmer. 'I was the last one there and everyone else was undressed and ready to jump in the water but no one had jumped in yet because none of them are comfortable swimmers so I ended up just stripping off to my underwear and then jumping in,' Payge said. The two teenagers were helping their friend tow his car after it got stuck on the beach . The incident happened near Burdan's Gate in Eastbourne, Wellington Harbour, at 10:30pm on Monday night . Payge said she is not a confident swimmer and didn't think about the shark-infested waters when she leaped into the harbour but she knew that the man's life depended on her. 'I wasn't expecting to get that far,' she said of the distance she swam out to sea. 'At the time I didn't really think about it. I just thought you know what there's a man out there suffering, I need to get to him and help him. 'Now I'm really proud of myself and I'm happy that I was there.' Police released images of the man unconscious and lying in his hospital bed an appealed for public help to identify him . The man appeared to be aged in his 30s and from a South Asian background . Police said the man was dressed but had no identificatoin on him, The Dominion Post reported. 'Unfortunately, due to his condition, police has been unable to speak with him and he was not carrying any identification that could help us find out who he is,' Detective Sergeant Grant Corroll said, appealing for anyone who recognises him to contact police. 'Given his critical stauts, time is of the essence,' he said. Even the murky water and it's inhabitants didn't stop the courageous teenager from jumping head-first into the harbour. Payge (right) said she is not a confident swimmer and didn't think about the shark-infested waters when she leaped into the harbour but she knew that the man's life depended on her . 'There's eels and multiple other things in there,' she said. 'Sometimes we do get sharks and whales  and stingrays but I didn't really think about that. Well I did but I tried to avoid that thought.' Two men, who were sitting on the rocks on the harbours edge, shone torches on the water so Payge would be able to see where she was going. The teenager said she was terrified she would be too late and that she would lose the man in the dark. 'My worst fear was that he wasn't there any more and that I was just too late,' she said. The man's cries for help were also heard by a fisherman, John Derek, who had been fishing earlier in the evening and returned as he realised that he had dropped his cell phone and went back to find it . 'Eventually I came across him and he was kind of floating. He was sinking but he was just on the surface. 'If I has been any longer I would have completely lost him and I would not have been able to find him.' According to Payge, the man had an Indian appearance and weighed between 70 and 80kg. She said both her and her cousin thought he was in his late 30s to early 40s. 'I got there and I couldn't lift him, he was so much bigger than me,' Payge said. Payge  began to panic and started screaming for someone to help her. After eight minutes, the group got the man back to shore and 15-year-old Kelly McKay(right) began performing CPR until paramedics arrived and took over . 17-year-old Logan Mason and a 25-year-old man swam out to Payge and assisted her in bringing the man back to shore. 'I got his feet out of the water but then I had to yell and get all the manly men to come and help me because I couldn't do it myself,' she said. After eight minutes, the group got the man back to shore and 15-year-old Kelly McKay began performing CPR until paramedics arrived and took over. 'My cousin Kelly did CPR she did so good. We're really proud of each other,' Payge said. 'I don't consider myself a hero, I just consider myself human because it's pretty much what anyone would do I thought.' Senior Sergeant Andre Kowalczyk of New Zealand Police said that the actions of the two girls is to be applauded . Senior Sergeant Andre Kowalczyk of New Zealand Police said that the actions of the two girls is to be applauded. 'They did an excellent job in very difficult circumstances and their efforts to enter the water to save this man's life were exceptional,' Sergeant Kowalczyk said. The man was taken to Hutt Hospital, where he is in intensive care in a stable condition. He is described as a male Indian approximately mid twenties to mid thirties. He was wearing a Maroon colour short sleeved polo shirt and a pair of black light-weight trousers. The man was not carrying any form of ID on him. According to Payge, Police found a pair of runners and a hoodie on the beach but it is not clear whether they belonged to the man or if there was another person in the water. 'I just really want to meet him and hug him and just understand why he was out there,' Payge said.","Two teenage girls risked their lives trying to save a drowning man .

"When her beloved dog collapsed and had to be rushed to the vet, Heather Goddard was horrified. The grandmother was left grief-stricken when tests showed Clover, an eight-year-old crossbreed, had lung cancer and would have to be put down. But the biggest shock came when she was told that her dog’s death was caused by passive smoking – the result of being in the house as she and her husband Keith puffed through 30 cigarettes each a day. Scroll down for video . Devastated: 62-year-old Heather Goddard, from Seaton Delaval, said her dog got lung cancer after inhaling the toxic chemicals from tobacco smoke - she is now speaking out to protect pets in the future . Happier times: Ms Goddard, with husband Keith, granddaughters Chelsea and Leona and dog Roger, quit smoking a year ago and has been told she now smells 'like a proper grandma, which is lovely to hear' Now Mrs Goddard, 61, has quit smoking and is alerting other pet owners to the dangers posed to animals by second-hand smoke. She and Mr Goddard, 67, of Seaton Delaval, Northumberland, were walking Clover in a park when the rescue dog became ill. They took her to a veterinary practice in Morpeth, where they were told she had black spots on her lungs and was also suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The vet said nothing more could be done for Clover, adding that the cause of her cancer was passive smoking. ‘Knowing my smoking was to blame was like somebody had just put a bullet into my heart. It was a nightmare that had come true,’ said Mrs Goddard, a retired cleaner who has another dog, Roger, as well as two cats and a rabbit. ‘Clover was a lovely dog. She was friendly and there wasn’t a bad bone in her body. Fond memories: She says thinking about Clover 'brings a tear to my eye just thinking about the damage my smoking was doing' - she is now hoping to inform others about the dangers of second-hand smoke . Clover had to be put down after a scan showed up black spots on her lungs . ‘She showed no signs or symptoms of being ill. We had no idea why she had collapsed until we took her to the vets. It was such a shock. ‘You don’t think about your animals but they are just like us. They can get illnesses like diabetes and cancer the same as us.’ Mrs Goddard says she now regrets exposing her family and her animals to years of cigarette smoke in the house and the car. She added: ‘I think I would have tried to give up earlier if I had known the damage it was doing to my animals. As long as the animals were fed I would be happy to go without food but I had to have my cigarettes. ‘I didn’t connect passive smoking with animals. You don’t realise how much of it they are taking in. My grandchildren are only here once or twice a week but our pets are with us 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.’ It still took her nearly three years following Clover’s death before she managed to quit her 30-a-day habit – and by then she too had been diagnosed with chronic lung disease. Her husband has also given up smoking, much to the delight of their three children and eight grandchildren. Mrs Goddard, who had smoked for 40 years, said: ‘I feel a lot healthier now I have stopped. ‘I can walk to the end of the path without getting as out of breath and I don’t use my inhalers as much. New start: Ms Goddard pictured with her grandchildren - who are 'always happy that I no longer smoke' ‘My grandchildren tell me they are glad I stopped smoking because I don’t smell of smoke any more. When I gave up smoking that stopped my illness from getting any worse.’ She hopes by speaking out she will alert other animal owners and help protect more pets from the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. ‘I would tell anyone who smokes and has animals to think twice,’ she said. ‘I know how difficult it is to give up but they need to think about their animals. Don’t give up trying, even if you have two cigarettes less a day.’ The British Veterinary Association has long warned of the dangers of smoking around pets, saying it can lead to incidents of cancer, asthma and bronchitis in cats and dogs.","Heather Goddard left devastated when pet dog Clover got lung cancer .

"The latest list of Australia's top 10 tourist destinations has the usual suspects of capital cities and beach side locations but an old mining town in New South Wales has made an unexpected appearance. Cessnock, about two hours north of Sydney, slipped in at number 10 on TripAdvisor's list ahead of one of Australia's most popular tourist attractions - the Gold Coast in Queensland. The sleepy town attracts about 30,000 visitors every year with its biggest drawcard being the gateway to the New South Wales' Hunter Valley wine region. In stark contrast, the Gold Coast pulls in a whopping 12million tourists each year to visit the variety of theme parks and sunny beaches it is so well known for. However, instead of the list being complied by comparing the number of people who have visited the destinations - the quality and quantity of the reviews on the site were analysed. Cessnock, which is the gateway to the Hunter Valley wine region (pictured), was listed number ten in TripAdvisor's top 10 tourist destinations of Australia . Although the Gold Coast pulls 12million people each year for its sunny beaches and theme parks - it didn't make it into the top ten tourist spots . Gold Coast Tourism chief executive Martin Winter said the ranking of reviews was not indicative of the millions of visitors to the Gold Coast every year . It comes as no great surprise that arguably Australia's most famous capital city, Sydney, came in at number one followed by fellow capital cities Melbourne and Brisbane. Sunny beach spots rated highly with Cairns, Port Douglas, Margaret River and Noosa also listed in the country's top ten holiday destinations. Hobart and Adelaide came in at sixth and ninth respectively - leaving just Darwin and Perth the only remaining capital cities not to make into the fave locations. Evidently the reviewers who jump on the TripAdvisor site to give their opinion of their holiday experiences prefer a relaxed winery tour over the adrenalin-filled fun at amusement parks. It comes as no surprise that arguably Australia's most famous capital city, Sydney, was ranked number one . Melbourne came runner up for its art, haute boutiques, multicultural dining and the pulsing and swanky nightlife . Brisbane was ranked number three for being the hub of Queensland culture both past and present . The other attractions in Cessnock mentioned on the site aside from the abundant vineyards are 'world-class golf courses, gourmet eateries, lush gardens and blissful spas'. Gold Coast Tourism chief executive Martin Winter said he was 'absolutely' surprised that the Gold Coast did not make the list. 'We dismiss the illicit comment outright,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's pretty clear that this is sample is flawed and even though consumers make independent comment that doesn't have anything to do with the overall attractiveness of the destination. 'Our international visitation was 13 per cent last year so we must be doing something right in the minds of most consumers.' Cairns made fourth spot for being the perfect city for merry revelers, passionate divers and adrenaline junkies, offering booming nightlife and heart-pounding adventure amid a vibrant and tropical setting . Port Douglas was voted in at number 5 for its perfect base in Northern Queensland for exploring the Great Barrier Reef, the Daintree rainforest and the beaches at Cape Tribulation - or just being pampered at day spas . The lively city of Hobart took out sixth spot for its unique mash-up of the 19th and 21st centuries, the waterfront cafes and restaurants that overlook a harbour bustling with yachts and fishing boats . 1. Sydney . 2. Melbourne . 3. Brisbane . 4. Cairns . 5. Port Douglas . 6. Hobart . 7. Margaret River . 8. Noosa . 9. Adelaide . 10. Cessnock . Mr Winter said Cessnock being included in the top 10 was a perfect example to illustrate his point. 'Not taking anything away from the beautiful Cessnock but clearly the sample size and the cohort that responds to TripAdvisor is not representative of the millions of people who have wonderful holidays throughout Australia on an annual basis,' he said. Cessnock mayor Bob Pynsent said the quality of the visit to his hometown made for a positive experience for people. 'When you compare the Gold Coast experience to a vineyard tranquility - whether it be wine tasting, golf, ballooning or just chilling out in the big city - we are attractive,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We hosted Japan for a pre-training camp in the Asia Cup and the number of world class acts across the concert season is another attraction so people go away and say "" I love that and I'm going to come back"".' Known as much for its wine region as the idyllic surf spot - Margaret River in Western Australia came seventh . The luxurious town of Noosa on Queensland's Sunshine Coast came in at number eight on the list . South Australia's capital city of Adelaide was ranked number nine for its enchanting treasure trove of shopping, fine arts, gastronomy and outdoor activity . Last but definitely not least - Cessnock which the mayors says is always a positive experience for visitors .","Old mining town of Cessnock came in at number 10 over the Gold Coast in TripAdviser's top 10 tourist destinations across Australia .

"Nigel Farage was left reeling today after losing three election candidates in less than 24 hours. The Ukip leader was left 'deeply shocked' after suspending MEP Janice Atkinson over allegations that her staff had concocted bogus expenses claims. Hours later the party confirmed a second senior figure, the party's candidate for Scunthorpe Stephen Howd, had been suspended following an 'alleged incident at his workplace'. The final blow came when the party's candidate for Westmorland and Lonsdale, Jonathan Stanley, sensationally quit claiming he was sick of the 'open racism and bullying' in the party. The Ukip leader said he was 'deeply shocked' with Janice Atkinson after a member of her staff was secretly filmed apparently trying to obtain an inflated invoice for a drinks reception in a bid to claim the money from the EU . The triple blow came after detectives were brought in to investigate the allegations that Mrs Atkinson's chief of staff Christine Hewitt was secretly filmed apparently trying to obtain an inflated invoice for a drinks reception in a bid to claim the money from the EU. A police spokesman said the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate was investigating the alleged fraud. Mrs Atkinson, an MEP for the South East, has now been axed as the party's candidate for Folkestone and Hythe in May’s election. The MEP had hosted a women’s fringe event – attended by Nigel Farage’s wife Kirsten – during Ukip’s spring conference in Margate, Kent, last month. The reception, where guests drank champagne, Bellini cocktails and dozens of bottles of wine, allegedly cost £950 and was paid by Mrs Hewitt on a credit card. But 24 hours later, it is claimed, Miss Hewitt returned to the restaurant and asked the manager to give her an invoice for £3,150 so she could claim back a larger amount from Brussels. She was allegedly filmed telling an undercover reporter from The Sun: ‘The idea is we overcharge them slightly because that’s the way of repatriating [the money].’ Mr Farage this morning attacked Mrs Atkinson and the member of staff over the ploy. He told LBC: ‘I was deeply shocked when I saw it. I thought it was one of the most incredibly stupid and dishonest things I’ve even seen in my life. ‘This was a member of staff. Exactly what the relationship between the member of staff and the asking of the false bill and Janice Atkinson I don’t know. We’ve suspended Janice Atkinson and we will hold a disciplinary hearing as soon as possible.' Stephen Howd (left) the Ukip candidate suspended today, with Mike and Barbara Speakman, members of UKIP's Scunthorpe, Brigg and Goole branch, with party leader Nigel Farage . Janice Atkinson (left) was due to fight the Folkestone and Hythe Commons seat on May 7. Jonathan Stanley (right) quit the party today citing 'open racism and bullying' Ostentatious breastfeeding . Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.' Immigrants causing traffic jams . Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four. 'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.' General secretary sex scandal . Ukip general secretary Roger Bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate Natasha Bolter in December. He claimed they slept together, she denied it. Doubts later emerged about her CV, with Oxford denying she studied there and questions about her teaching qualifications . Rate an immigrant game . A Ukip game emerged last year asking supporters to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans' in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella. Weeding out the lunatics . Ukip candidates chief David Soutter revealed he spent half his time 'weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn't be there.' Candidate quits over 'poofter' comments . Kerry Smith was forced to quit as Ukip candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock in December after being taped mocking gay party members as 'poofters', joking about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referring to someone as a 'Chinky bird'. Taking money from Brussels . Ukip secures a £1.5 million pot of taxpayers' cash by forming a new European-wide political party. The Ukip leader added: ‘It would be mistake for me to pre-judge this but on the evidence of what that member of staff did, it does not look good.’ He said he had asked her ‘what on earth is going on’ when he called but did not get a clear answer. Mr Farage said: ‘They have asked a commercial enterprise to do something which is against the law. ‘I was shocked I simply couldn’t believe we could potentially find ourselves in this position.’ Mrs Atkinson who last year caused outrage after she called a Thai woman constituent a ‘ting tong’, had been due to stand the general election. But a Ukip spokesman said last night: ‘The party is incredibly disappointed with Ms Atkinson, who appears to have exercised extremely poor judgment in acting in a way that the party has never, and would never condone.' The spokesman added: 'The party has acted swiftly and immediately, and just as we showed when we suspended another MEP for financial irregularities, we always maintain a zero-tolerance attitude towards acts of this nature.’ Mr Farage, a candidate for nearby Thanet South, told the Telegraph last night: ‘If what she has been suspended for is right, I am astonished she could have done something quite so stupid. 'It looks like a claim that wasn’t made, I am pleased to say, but a claim that was intended to be made that may not have been as genuine as perhaps it should have been.’ It is understood Mrs Atkinson and Miss Hewitt have been reported to Kent Police and the EU anti-fraud office. Mrs Farage is not thought to have been aware of the incident and is not accused of any wrongdoing. Mrs Atkinson was elected as an MEP last year after joining Ukip in 2011. On top of a salary of close to £80,000, she is able to claim for expenses from the public purse. The 52-year-old found herself in trouble last year after she was recorded by TV cameras calling the wife of a Ukip supporter ‘a ting tong from somewhere’. She insisted the comments were naive rather than malicious and said she was ‘incredibly sorry’ for offending the woman. In December it emerged that she owed more than £2,000 in child support to her ex-husband, despite previously criticising ‘feckless families’ who have more children than they can afford. She has also been pictured sticking up her middle finger to a camera and was accused of swearing at protesters. Folkestone and Hythe is seen as a safe Conservative seat, although Mrs Atkinson was a high-profile candidate. The latest problem for Ukip came after Mr Farage renewed warnings that he expected a ‘very dirty, nasty’ election campaign and urged his party to ‘turn the other cheek’. Mr Farage spoke in Rochester, Kent, where he welcomed former Medway Tory councillors Tom Mason and Vaughan Hewett to Ukip to stand in May's local elections.","Two candidates have been suspended by the party with a third resigning .

"A six-year-old boy was buried today in St. Louis after he was killed last week in an gun attack his parents say stemmed from a traffic dispute. Marcus Johnson Jr visited O'Fallon Park with his parents, four siblings, and other friends and family members while recovering from heart surgery one week earlier. He had a post-operation appointment the day he was killed. Police are searching for the occupants of a car who shot at the family's minivan as they left the north St Louis park in a minivan at about 7.30pm on March 11. Marcus Johnson Jr.'s parents figured a day at a city park was just what the 6-year-old kindergartner needed while recovering from heart surgery the previous week. Instead, his family buried Marcus today after the child was shot in the chest and killed in an attack his mother and father said stemmed from a traffic dispute . Marcus Johnson Sr. said he returned fire in self-defense as the rolling shootout continued for several blocks. Marcus's 15-year-old brother and a 69-year-old family friend were also wounded. 'My baby already had stress to live in this world, and for somebody to take his life away is wrong,' mother Quiana Johnson told the St Louis Post Dispatch. She said that Marcus, who was in kindergarten, had suffered from a heart ailment since birth. His family had to watch him closely because he was taking blood-thinning drugs so he had to be careful not to get bruised. 'He was a happy, happy, loving and caring kid,' she told the St Louis Post Dispatch. 'Through his sickness he was happy.' The day of the shooting, the family had piled into their recently purchased 2006 Pontiac Montana and headed to the park. Quiana Johnson said it 'was a nice day' and that it gave them a chance to 'get out of the house and do some things as a family'. She said that as they were leaving, her husband saw someone he knew and stopped his vehicle to chat, annoying another man who was stuck because of the traffic. Quiana Johnson said the man told them it was his 'hood' and that the family shouldn't hold up traffic. Marcus suffered from a heart ailment and had surgery the week before he was shot. He had been at a post-operation appointment prior to going to the park. His mother said he was taking blood-thinning drugs and had to be careful not to get bruised . The family returned to the car and as they drove to the exit of the park, the man followed them and began shooting. Quiana Johnson had a gun on her - which she had recently bought because of a fear of break-ins in her neighborhood - and when she noticed her son had been shot, she handed it to her husband. 'I told him that if he didn't shoot back, they will kill us all,' she told the St Louis Post Dispatch. She crawled to the back of the van, where her son had been shot and the rest of her family members were huddling. 'I said, ""little Marcus, wake up. Don't go to sleep. Mommy is right here with you. Wake up."" He was trying,' she said. Once they escaped the shooting they called the police who took Marcus to Barnes-Jewish Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Funeral arrangements were taken care of at Ronald L Jones Funeral Chapel in St Louis. Johnson said Marcus, his youngest son, was diagnosed with a heart ailment as an infant.","Marcus Johnson Jr was shot as his family was leaving park in their minivan .

"Harrison Ford's flying ability was called into question in an official report following his first aviation crash, Daily Mail Online can reveal. The Hollywood star, who was rushed to hospital after crashing a vintage plane in Venice, California on Thursday, also slammed a helicopter into a riverbed back in 1999. It is not believed that Ford, 72, is to blame for his latest - and what is his third - aviation incident at Penmar Golf Course near Santa Monica Municipal Airport, with early reports suggesting engine failure is at fault. But an official report into Ford's October 1999 accident, obtained by Daily Mail Online, reveals it was caused by 'the pilot's delay in adding power during a power-on recovery'. Ford had flown the helicopter from Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles 45 miles northwest towards Santa Clarita when he hit trouble. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Full recovery: Ford was rushed from the scene bleeding heavily from a head wound, his injuries were described only as 'moderate' and he is expected to recover fully. Pictured, an aerial view of the crash . Rescue: Harrison Ford is treated at the scene of his crash in Venice, California, yesterday . The pilot was practicing autorotations to a power-on recovery. When he attempted to recover the power, the engine did not respond as quickly as anticipated and the helicopter landed hard, hitting on the rear heels of both skids. The flight instructor said that when he saw the pilot was late adding power, he attempted to correct the situation but was unsuccessful. The surface of the dry riverbed was mostly soft sand. The left skid heel contacted a log that was embedded in the sand and the helicopter pitched forward onto the skid toes and rolled over onto its left side. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows: . The pilot's delay in adding power during a power-on recovery from an autorotation, which resulted in a hard landing and rollover. The flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight was also causal. Source: NTSB . Ford was practicing 'auto rotations' - an emergency landing technique that simulates engine failure. He had completed one 'auto-rotation' but on his second he was 'late bringing in the power', according to the documents. As a result, when Ford attempted to recover, the helicopter engine did not respond quickly enough and the aircraft began plummeting to the ground. The unidentified flying instructor who was aboard with the actor was forced to take over the controls and try to level the helicopter but he was unable to do so and the aircraft came crashing down into the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita and flipped over. Luckily Ford, and the unnamed instructor, were unharmed in the crash but the helicopter was 'substantially damaged', according to the document. Coincidentally the helicopter was registered to MG Aviation – the same firm to which the 1942 vintage plane involved in Ford's latest crash is registered to. The official report, which does not name Ford or his instructor, states: 'On October 23, 1999, at 1115 hours Pacific daylight time, a Bell 206-L4, N36R, landed hard and rolled over in the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita, California. 'The helicopter, operated by MG Aviation, Teterboro, New Jersey, under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, was substantially damaged.' The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) document goes on to say that the pilot reported that he 'successfully completed one practice autorotation and entered a second approximately 600 feet agl.' It adds: 'When he attempted to recover power, the engine did not respond as quickly as anticipated and the helicopter settled hard into the soft creek bed.' The certified flying instructor (CFI) flying with the Star Wars legend, reported that, 'the pilot had been late bringing in the power and he had gotten on the controls during the flare to help the pilot and level the helicopter. 'The pilot reported that when he realized there was a lack of power, he tried to push the nose over. 'Both the pilot and CFI applied full collective, and reported that there was not sufficient rotor rpm to effectively cushion the landing, causing the helicopter to land on the heels of both skids. 'The surface of the dry riverbed was mostly soft sand; the aft end of the left skid contacted a 12-inch-diameter log that was embedded within the riverbed. Experienced: Harrison Ford at the controls of his helicopter in February last year . 'The tip of the left skid nosed into the sand and the helicopter rolled over onto its left side.' Tests carried out on the helicopter following the crash found 'no abnormalities' in the cockpit controls, engine or other parts of the aircraft. The NTSB concluded that the accident was caused by, 'The pilot's delay in adding power during a power-on recovery from an autorotation, which resulted in a hard landing and rollover.' It also pointed out that 'The flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight was also causal.' Ford was not named in the official report but its timing and circumstances were identical to a report at the time by the respected Los Angeles Times that he had been involved in a helicopter crash. Ford's air mishaps didn't stop there. Just over a year later Ford was involved in a second aviation incident, when he was forced to make an emergency landing at Lincoln Municipal Airport in Nebraska. The six-seater Beech Bonanza aircraft was forced to land due to bad weather conditions and it clipped the runway damaging the wings. Ford played down the two incidents at the time, telling Playboy magazine: 'They were more misadventures of a mechanical or weather-induced type. 'With my first helicopter, I had an issue with fuel control once, which resulted in substantial damage to the helicopter prop but no injuries to the two souls aboard. So that ended well.' Ford is currently being treated in hospital where he is described as being in a 'fair to moderate' condition. In audio of his conversation with air traffic control moments before Thursday's crash, a calm and collected Ford can be heard asking for an emergency landing as his engines had failed. He could not make the runway at Santa Monica Airport so he chose to land the two-seater World War Two-era plane on a green at Penmar Golf Course. Seasoned aviator: Ford, who has been flying planes since the 1960s, was the only person in the plane at the time of the crash . Ford crashed into the Penmar golf course (left) after appearing to veer off course from the runway (right) in order to avoid homes in between . Witnesses described how the veteran actor was bleeding profusely from his face and he was rushed to hospital in a 'critical' condition but this was soon downgraded. His son Ben Ford tweeted that he was 'battered, but ok'. Fellow aviators have come out in praise of the star for managing to navigate the vintage plane away from the nearby residential area and on to an empty part of the golf course, with one experienced pilot stating 'everything he did was perfect'.","Movie star, 72, has been hailed a hero in his latest plane crash when his vintage plane came down on a golf course in Venice, California .

"Suspended hundreds of feet in the air amid glistening pillars of ice illuminated with ghostly lights from below, this could easily be a computer-generated scene from the latest sci-fi blockbuster movie. But in fact these ethereal photographs were taken in real life, and show extreme sportsman and climber Stephan Siegrist, 43, ascending the Voringsfossen icefall which is part of a gigantic glacier in Eidfjord, Norway. The stunning images were captured by fellow mountaineer and photographer Thomas Senf. While the 500ft frozen waterfall is regularly scaled by climbers during daylight, he said he wanted to capture the beauty of the falls by night. Scroll down for video . Spot the climber: Stephan Siegrist, 43, scales the Voringsfossen icefall, a 500ft-tall frozen waterfall that forms part of a glacier in Norway . There he is: While hundreds of climbers attempt to scale the fall during the day, few attempt it at night. With bright lights illuminating his efforts from below, Mr Siegrist appears to be on the set of a sci-fi movie . Stunning: Mr Siegrist (pictured) trained as an apprentice carpenter before falling in love with mountaineering during a ski trip as a teenager. He gave up woodwork aged 26, and has earned his living from climbing ever since . He said: 'Photography and filming at night is a big challenge because of the lighting. The ways to play with the factors of light, time and environment fascinate me endlessly. 'I had considered for a long time how to work with artificial light, which is normally only possible in a photo studio, in major mountains. 'The transparency and reflective properties of ice in the sun had often caught my eye. With its virtually unlimited number of icefalls, Norway seemed like the perfect place to put those ideas into practice.' Climber Mr Siegrist was born in Meikirch, Switzerland, near to Bern, which is within sight of the northern Alps. While he trained as a carpenter, he fell in love with mountaineering after a skiing trip as a teenager. Out of this world: Mr Senf (pictured bottom right in both images) was primarily a climber in the early stages of his career, but began to incorporate photography into his adventures, and took these images during one trip in 2012 . Frozen solid: For a large part of the year the Voringsfossen icefall is liquid, but during the winter months the bitterly cold air freezes it solid, allowing climbers to attempt to scale it . Aged 26 he gave up woodwork, became a professional mountain guide, and has made a living from climbing ever since. Over the course of a near 20-year career he has racked up hundreds of climbing hours, making first ascents on all seven continents. As well as ice climbing, as demonstrated in these photographs, he also specialises in big-wall climbing - scaling sheer rock faces that usually require more than one day to ascend - and bouldering - climbing without the use of safety harnesses or ropes. Meanwhile photographer Mr Senf qualified in mechanical engineering, but moved to Switzerland aged 21 to pursue his passion for mountaineering. Adventurer: Mr Senf, who took an expedition to the icefall with Mr Siegrist in order to photograph it, is pictured left, and right during a climb . Starting out purely as a climber, he and a group of friends made two first ascents of peaks in the Himalayas, before he began incorporating photography into his adventures. He captured these stunning images of Mr Siegrist during a trip to Norway in 2012. He added: 'During the summer months, water tumbles from the cliff tops. Come winter, this majestic landscape is transformed as the waters are suspended mid-flow creating icefalls. 'Climbers frequently scale them during daylight hours, but we wanted to capture their full beauty and colour at night.'","Stunning images captured by photographer Thomas Senf as climber Stephan Siegrist, 43, scaled frozen waterfall .

"A nine-year-old boy wearing only pajamas and no shoes fled to his Minnesota school as his step mom allegedly chased him yelling 'I'm going to kill you'. The child, who has not been named, ran into Dayton's Bluff Achievement Plus Elementary where teachers found him hysterically crying on Wednesday around 3.40pm, according to the criminal complaint. Shortly after, the  principal told police his step-mom, Tashay Caprice Johnson, 24, came running into the school. A boy, nine, told police he ran to his school after his step mom allegedly told him she was going to kill him (Tashay Caprice Johnson pictured above) Johnson, 24, was arrested following the incident and charged with making terroristic threats and malicious punishment of a child . The boy claimed Johnson hit him on the head with a baseball bat, struck him in the face with her fist and also hit him in the arm with a belt before telling him she was going to grab a gun and kill him. Johnson was arrested and faces up to five years in prison if convicted of both charges including making terroristic threats and malicious punishment of a child. Police said they found injuries that matched the trauma the boy described including swelling on the left side of his head and marks on his left arm that appeared to be from a belt, according to 11Alive. They also found scratches near his left eye and the right side of his neck. While officers were speaking to Johnson at her home, they later found the baseball bat and arrested her. Johnson, right, denied assaulting the boy and told police she had agreed with his dad to have him sit in the corner as punishment but he kept running around the house . On Wednesday after the boy ran into the school, the principal blocked Johnson from entering until they could piece together what had transpired. The boy told police earlier that day his teacher had walked him home so that she could talk to his parents about his behavioral problems at school. Once the teacher left their home, that is when he said Johnson told him he was going to get a 'whooping'. After she allegedly hit him and said she was going to get the gun, he fled from home. Johnson denied assaulting the boy or threatening to kill him, and she did not know how he got the belt marks on his arm, according to Twin Cities. She told police that after the teacher left their home, she spoke to the child's father and they both decided to have him sit in the corner as punishment, but he ran around the house instead, the complaint said. Following Johnson's arrest, the boy's father jumped and said 'I whoop that kid but it doesn't do any good'. If she is convicted of the charges, Johnson faces  $10,000 in fines for the terroristic threat charge and $3,000 in fines for the malicious punishment charge, according to KSTP.

"Only one in three people routinely see police officers patrolling their neighbourhood, a new report has revealed. Critics said the shocking statistics sounded the death knell for the traditional Dixon Of Dock Green-style beat bobby pounding Britain’s streets. Police chiefs warned the fall in police visibility would get worse if threatened major budget cuts are pushed through after the general election. But Home Secretary Theresa May has argued that since the Coalition’s austerity drive began in 2010, crime has tumbled – showing police forces have successfully continued to crack offending despite being ordered to make savings. Scroll down for video . Decline: Just 32 per cent of people saw a police foot patrol at least once a week in 2013-14 . The research, published by the Office For National Statistics yesterday also found one in five people think it is ‘likely’ they will become a victim of crime over the next 12 months amid concerns over community safety. The most damning finding was the dwindling number of police officers or police community support officers (PCSOs) seen on foot patrols since the Coalition came to power. Experts say not only does neighbourhood policing help catch criminals, it also deters offending, makes the public feel safe and strengthens links between the police and communities. But only 32 per cent of people saw bobbies on the beat at least once a week in 2013-14, compared to 40 per cent in 2010-11. And while the proportion who saw officers on foot once a month rose from 34 per cent to 40 per cent, the number never seeing them at all rose from 25 per cent to 28 per cent. The figures coincide with a fall in the number of police officers and PCSOs from 161,000 to around 140,000 since ministers began their austerity drive. Fear: One in five people said they thought it 'likely' they would be a victim of crime in the next year - a feeling at odds with Home Secretary Theresa May's assertion that crime has dropped since the cuts came in . There has been a reduction of 20 per cent since 2011 in the amount spent by the Home Office on the police. Constabularies are also bracing themselves for further cuts amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds after the election. David Green, criminologist and founder of think-tank Civitas, said: ‘Theresa May has said police time is being used more efficiently and there is less waste but this shows they have cut so far that it is starting to reduce police visibility. ‘It means the policy of neighbourhood policing, which was very popular, has become if not quite a dead letter, then severely weakened by the reductions in police strength.’ Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said: ‘Neighbourhood policing – the bedrock of British policing – is being eroded. There has been a reduction of 20 per cent since 2011 in the amount spent by the Home Office on the police - and chiefs warn foot patrols will decrease more if further cuts are made . ‘The Government claims that they have increased the proportion of police officers on the frontline. The public see it different with fewer people saying that they regularly see bobbies on the beat.’ Steve White, chairman of Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: ‘This underlines the sad fact that, although the public highly values the work that police officers do to keep them safe, they are seeing fewer and fewer of them around on the street. ‘It represents a sad indictment of the Government’s policing policies. Quite clearly, cuts have consequences and the government cuts have severely damaged the service’s ability to keep people safe and lock up criminals.’ Last month police unions in the West Midlands warned police cuts meant bobbies on the beat had become ‘an endangered species’. The ONS survey found the proportion of people who felt positively about the police rose from 59 per cent in 2010-11 to 63 per cent last year, while those who had confidence in the police rose from 72 per cent to 76 per cent. According to the Crime Survey of England and Wales, based on people’s experiences of crime, overall crime had fallen 25 per cent since 2010-11 to 7.1million incidents, the lowest since 1981. The total number of crimes reported to forces in England and Wales has fallen from 4.1million to 3.7million over the same period. Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘Police reform is working and crime has fallen by more than a fifth since 2010. Citizens and communities are safer than at any point since the survey began. ‘Under this Government, police forces have shown that, with reform, it is possible to deliver more with less. ‘The police watchdog has made clear that there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels, the visibility of the police in the community and the quality of service provided. What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are.’","Office for National Statistics find 32 per cent saw police patrol every week .

"Victims say former Rotherham council chiefs who failed to tackle child sex grooming on their watch, such as Roger Stone (pictured with Dolly Parton), should be stripped of honours . Former council chiefs who failed to tackle child sex grooming on their watch should be stripped of their honours, say victims and campaigners. They warn that letting the ex-officials keep their awards will ‘bring shame’ on the system. Those criticised over the Rotherham scandal, in which horrific abuse was ignored, include former council leader Roger Stone OBE and ex-children’s services and education heads Joyce Thacker OBE and Diane Billups MBE. Former South Yorkshire chief constable Meredydd Hughes CBE has also come under fire for claiming not to know about the scale of child grooming in Rotherham. Campaigning MP Simon Danczuk, a member of Parliament’s Communities and Local Government Committee which will grill Mr Stone today, said: ‘It brings shame on the honours system if these awards are not removed. ‘If these people have any decency, they will give back their honours. These people have badly let down vulnerable young girls and turned a blind eye to the most horrendous abuse.’ The council and police in Rotherham were savaged in two reports by independent expert Professor Alexis Jay and Home Office official Louise Casey. At least 1,400 girls in the town were exploited over 16 years by gangs of mainly Pakistani men. Local Labour MP Sarah Champion said the number may be as high as 2,000 as more young women are coming forward all the time. David Greenwood, a solicitor representing 40 of the victims, said: ‘They [the officials] have been shown in evidence-based reports to have been asleep on the job. It undermines the integrity of the system if these people retain their awards. They should be forced to give them up.’ According to Mrs Casey, the establishment in Rotherham ignored child sexual exploitation due to ‘misplaced political correctness’. Police also saw victims as ‘little slags’, said one person interviewed for her report. Mrs Casey highlighted examples including an officer who told one victim: ‘Don’t worry – you aren’t the first girl to be raped by XX and you won’t be the last.’ One of the victims in Rotherham, known as Jessica, said: ‘It is ridiculous that these people still have their honours. How can they keep them when they let 2,000 girls down?’ Senior officials who have apologised over the Oxford abuse scandal, in which at least 300 girls were groomed, also hold honours. Oxfordshire County Council chief executive Joanna Simons has a CBE, while Thames Valley chief constable Sara Thornton was awarded a CBE and Queen’s Policing Medal. Honours can be removed from those who damage the ‘system’s reputation’. Any decision has to be taken by the Honours Forfeiture Committee, whose recommendation is sent to the Queen for final approval. A Government spokesman said: ‘Forfeiture action is confidential and we cannot comment on whether or not specific cases are being considered.’ Mr Stone, Mr Hughes and Mrs Thacker were unavailable for comment. Mrs Billups said: ‘I know in my heart what I did and I know why I got the MBE and what I gave for it.’ Criticised: Joyce Thacker OBE was Rotherham’s director of children’s services from 2008 to 2014 . JOYCE THACKER OBE: Rotherham’s director of children’s services, 2008-2014.Several abused girls were known to her team for months before any action was taken.

MEREDYDD HUGHES CBE: South Yorkshire Chief Constable, 2004-11. Savaged by Home Affairs Committee after admitting he had ‘singularly failed’ victims. DIANE BILLUPS MBE: Executive director of education at Rotherham, 2001-2005. Accused of trying to force a researcher to remove sections of a report on child exploitation. JOANNA SIMONS CBE: Chief executive of Oxfordshire County Council since 2005. Presided over ‘systematic failure’ which led to more than 300 girls becoming victims, according to the NSPCC charity.

"A rare badger suffered horrific deep bite wounds following a fight over its territory and had to be admitted to a rescue centre. The male badger was found in an outdoor toilet in Beaminster in Dorset and was admitted to RSPCA West Hatch Wildlife Centre in Taunton, Somerset with wounds to its neck and rump. Experts believe the animal is likely to have been injured in a fight over its territory because females usually give birth in February and are ready to mate again straight away - leading to fierce competition between males. A rare albino badger was taken to a rescue centre after being found with deep bite wounds to its neck and rump, believed to have been caused by fighting over territory during the current mating season . RSPCA wildlife centre supervisor Paul Oaten said: 'Albino badgers are fairly rare so to have one admitted to the centre only happens once in a blue moon. 'This poor badger came in to us with territorial bite wounds on his neck and rump, but other than that he is in good condition. 'He has been seen by the vet and had the wounds cleaned up and will be undergoing a course of antibiotics.' Mr Oaten said it was common to see badgers with these type of wounds during the breeding season. The injured animal was rescued as dozens of badgers have been born in Somerset, in time for Spring. Staff at Secret World Wildlife Rescue in Somerset are caring for three badger cubs which need feeding around the clock. The first cub, named Little Star, has grown from 80g to over a kilogram since being rescued and cared for by the centre. Three rescued badger cubs are being cared for at Secret World Wildlife Rescue in Somerset . The animal was brought in from the cold into a house in Derbyshire by a Jack Russell, who carried it in its jaws. She has been joined by another eight-week old badger cub called Vogue. The third badger cub arrived only a week ago after being found with injuries caused by a dog. There has been an increase in births of badgers, like these three, during Spring in Somerset .

"It has baffled scientists for years - why the penguin waddles in such a distinctive manner. Most other diving birds are able to simply fly on land - but not the penguin. Now, researchers hope to unravel the mystery of the waddle - and find out how it evolved . Watch the penguins on their custom catwalk . Using a special motion detecting 'catwalk' Professor Hutchison and paleobiologist James Proffitt have been measuring how the penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle. Researchers set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it. The penguins walked over this to get their breakfast . Researchers also filmed the walk in slow motion, and are looking for the forces the birds excert, how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are. Scientists from the Royal Veterinary College and University of Texas at Austin have visited London Zoo to study the way the animals walk. Prof John Hutchison from the RVC said: 'The upright posture and waddling gait of penguins is not often seen in other birds. 'Most wing-propelled diving birds move using flight when they are not in the water.' Using a special motion detecting 'catwalk' Professor Hutchison and paleobiologist James Proffitt have been measuring how the Humboldt penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle. 'We're trying to understand the minute detail of how waddling works with living penguins, and then taking that back in time, looking at the fossil record of penguins to understand how evolving for such a specialised underwater lifestyle has affected their ability to move on land,' said Proffitt. 'We set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it. If they want to move quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain they may jump with both feet together. 'The penguins walked over this to get their breakfast . 'We were looking for the forces they exert, how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are.' 'Zoos provide an opportunity for research scientists to look at organisms that otherwise would be very difficult to study in the wild.' Penguin keeper Zuzanna Matyasova said: 'We know our penguins really well, we know what they eat, we know how they behave on a day to day basis, and we know how to breed them for conservation purposes.

"Officers have arrested 21-year-old Matthew Ellery (pictured) on suspicion of theft . A UKIP candidate handed his own son – a Ukip councillor – in to police after discovering valuable stock from his antiques shop had been stolen. Alan Stone, 50, said the decision to take Matthew Ellery to the police had been the most difficult of his life. But he added that he hoped it would show he was capable of making hard choices and worthy of a seat at Westminster. Mr Stone is hoping to oust the disgraced former culture secretary Maria Miller in May. The father-of-four admitted he had a 'lump in his throat' as he apparently escorted the 21-year-old to the local police station. Officers arrested Ellery on suspicion of theft. Mr Stone said: 'It was the hardest thing I have ever had to do but I would do it again. I took him to the police station, absolutely. I did what I had to do. The police are still investigating.' The grandfather added: 'I made a complaint about stock going missing – whether he stole it from me I do not know yet. I will stand by him when it is all over. He is my son.' Ellery, who controversially won a place on Basingstoke and Dean Council last year, has been released on bail until after the election. Mr Stone, who was announced as Ukip's candidate for Basingstoke last year, said he was hopeful of winning the seat despite the arrest. 'It is a family issue,' he said. 'It could be very positive. The fact that I am willing to take my own children to court if they do something wrong is a positive move. I am capable of taking the hard decisions if they are needed.' Alan Stone, 50, said the decision to take his son to the police had been the most difficult of his life . The parliamentary candidate admitted his action had received 'mixed reactions' from the rest of his family, with some even suggesting the move was politically motivated. He added that he had not seen his son, who uses his mother's maiden name, for a week. Ellery's election to his local council was shrouded in controversy, coming as it did after he caused outrage by branding the women in his town 'pug ugly' on social media. He also posted a message on Facebook saying that he 'felt like stabbing someone'. Mr Stone went to the police three weeks ago after finding stock had been stolen from his shop Squirrel Antiques in Basingstoke over the last year. The businessman, who also runs Stone's Fine Jewellery in the Hampshire town, would not confirm the value of the theft but it is believed the items taken amount to tens of thousands of pounds. Mr Stone said: 'The police do not know the exact figure. I know my stock has gone missing over the past year – of course I do.' Hampshire police said: 'The 21-year-old arrested man has been re-bailed pending further enquiries. He's now due to return on bail on May 14.' Basingstoke and Dean Council said it had not been informed of the arrest and Ellery had not been suspended. Ukip refused to comment saying it was a family matter.

"He's out: Ferguson City Council unanimously voted on a resolution to part ways with City Manager John Shaw, 39, effective immediately . The city manager of Ferguson, Missouri, has resigned in the wake of a US Justice Department probe that found a wide range of systemic racially biased practices by the police and municipal court. This evening, the Ferguson City Council unanimously voted on a resolution to part ways with City Manager John Shaw effective immediately. Shaw, 39, was among several individuals heavily criticized in the scathing Justice Department report issued last Wednesday. Shaw had held . the position in the St. Louis suburb since 2007. The Justice Department launched an investigation into . Ferguson's police department and municipal court after the August 9 shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a . white police officer. A news release from the city said the Council had reached a 'mutual separation agreement' with Shaw, the city's chief executive. The statement also said a nationwide search for Shaw's replacement would begin immediately. 'I believe that the city of Ferguson has the resolve to overcome the challenges it faces in the coming months and emerge as a stronger community for it,' Shaw, 39, said in a statement included in the release. Since Brown's death seven months ago, Mayor James Knowles has been the public face and voice of Ferguson's city government. But Shaw held the legal power to make personnel and policy changes in the police department —   not Knowles, a part-time officeholder who earns less than $5,000 annually. Scroll down for video . Ousted: Embattled Ferguson City Manager John Shaw walks past a police officer as he leaves a closed door meeting with Ferguson's mayor and City Council . Shaw has been Ferguson's city manager for eight years. He had previously worked as city clerk and assistant to the city administrator in Shrewsbury, another town in St. Louis County. Online biographies indicate that he grew up in north St. Louis County and lived in Ferguson before working for the city. He was honored in 2013 as a distinguished alumnus of a public policy administration program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, which is located near Ferguson, and was listed as an adviser for the university's student group for aspiring city managers. Shaw has not spoken publicly about the shooting, protests, grand jury inquiry or Justice Department investigation. He stood silently beside two City Council members at Knowles' Wednesday news conference responding to the Justice Department report and declined, through a city spokesman, a subsequent Associated Press interview request. He was not at Tuesday's meeting. The Justice Department report repeatedly cited Shaw's role in encouraging his police force to aggressively ticket motorists as a means to generate revenue. In one instance, he responded to a Jackson email about a record-setting month for court revenue — nearly $180,000 in February 2011 alone — with the exclamation, 'Wonderful!' Catalyst: The Justice Department launched an investigation into policing practices in Ferguson after Officer Darren Wilson (left) shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in August . City divided: Analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed African-Americans make up 93 percent of arrests . And when Jackson told Shaw in January 2013 that municipal court revenue had exceeded $2million the previous year, the city manager was similarly excited. 'Awesome!' he said, according to the federal inquiry. Municipal Judge Ronald Brockmeyer stepped down to help the divided city 'begin its healing process' But in a statement issued after the announcement of his departure, Shaw said his office 'never instructed the police department to target African Americans, nor falsify charges to administer fines, nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor. Any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false,' Shaw said. Shaw's resignation comes a day after Ferguson Municipal Judge Ronald Brockmeyer stepped down to help the divided city 'begin its healing process' and to promote public confidence in the court system. Last Thursday, two Ferguson Police Department commanders also quit after racist emails were released during the DOJ's investigation into the police department. Sgt. William Mudd and Capt. Rick Henke resigned Thursday and City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty was fired Wednesday. US Attorney General Eric Holder called the DOJ's report 'searing,' saying the investigation found the Ferguson community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be 'disproportionately harmful to African-American residents.' 'This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized,' Holder said. 'A community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents. 'A community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue.' Embarassement: Last Thursday, two Ferguson Police Department commanders also quit after racist emails were released during the DOJ's investigation . Speaking out: US Attorney General Eric Holder called the DOJ's report 'searing' Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said Friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the DOJ, Reuters reports. Speaking at a town hall event in South Carolina two days after the release of the DOJ report, President Obama said the Ferguson probe exposed a 'broken, racially biased system.' A St. Louis County grand jury and the Justice Department both declined to bring charges in the Michael Brown shooting against Officer Darren Wilson, who left the department. The Justice Department report said Wilson acted in self-defense when he shot Brown. But the agency said in its report last week that Ferguson's police and court systems functioned as a money-making enterprise that heightened tensions among residents. Strong words: President Obama said the Ferguson probe exposed a 'broken, racially biased system' The DOJ report cited cases of racial profiling and bigotry by the predominantly white police force in the mostly black St. Louis suburb. Brown's shooting prompted protests in the St. Louis area and across the nation. Analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed African-Americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in Ferguson. African-Americans also made up most of incidents in which officers used force and all incidents where police dogs bit citizens.","Ferguson City Council voted unanimously to accept City Manager John Shaw's resignation effective immediately .

Was he trying to impress his new bosses with the smart blazer and tie? The 54-year-old star started his Top Gear career as a smartly-dressed twenty-something with a background in journalism . Honeymoon period: With the first Mrs Clarkson, Alexandra James, in 1989. It was over in months, but the relationship restarted years later during his second marriage. She broke up with Clarkson for one of his friends and wedding guests . Racy moment: By now married to Frances Cain, whom he married in April 2003, (pictured together right), Jeremy is caught snogging a BBC producer while test-driving a new Honda in 2000. It was said he had to apologise to both of his wives . Life is full of ups and downs. At Blackpool in 2001, Jeremy and his mother ride 'The Big One' rollercoaster for a new series called 'Speed'. The show saw Clarkson go around the world, looked into the art of travelling very fast and why people enjoy travelling at such great speed . Flying high: Last flight of Concorde in 2003. Finding his sworn enemy, Piers Morgan, in the seat behind, Jeremy tips champagne into his lap. Yesterday, after his sacking was announced, Piers Morgan tweeted 'If he'd stuck to just punching me, he'd have been fine. #Clarkson' Egg on his face: Not everyone at Oxford Brookes University thought Jeremy should get an honorary degree  in 2005. Road protester Rebecca Lush gave him a custard pie. ‘Good shot!’ he told her. Clarkson was nominated by the School of Technology for his championing of high standards in engineering, but green campaigners attacked the move, saying he had a poor stance on the environment . Ice and a slice: He enjoys a G&T at the wheel, driving to the North Pole in 2007 — and is, inevitably, censured by bosses for ‘misuse of alcohol’. The incident was one of a string of controversies to hit the outspoken presenter during his long career . The Banned Waggon: Jeremy flouts the smoking ban — on air — to test drive a Porsche pipe. Clarkson was then shown 'eating' the pipe's bowl, before running from the stage having burned his tongue. The Ash anti-smoking lobby demand an apology . Baywatch bulge: In Barbados in 2008, entries for the annual Michael Winner lookalike competition are limbering up at the Sandy Lane Hotel . Road rage: Lorry drivers protest after Jeremy cracks a joke which appeared to reference Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe and 'Suffolk Strangler' Steve Wright. He said: 'What matters to lorry drivers? Murdering prostitutes? Fuel economy?' he says. 'This is a hard job and I'm not just saying this to win favour with lorry drivers... change gear, change gear.... check your mirrors... murder a prostitute...' Not exactly Poldark: The costume department clearly enjoyed themselves with this Top Gear episode on the north Cornish coast . Worse for wear: He insists he’s not leaving the family home to move into a bachelor pad in London, after photos appeared of a lively night out with a former Miss World in 2011. The pictures showed him embracing Linda Petursdottir, with his trademark cigarette between his fingers, before the pair were whisked off in a taxi . On tour: Leaving a Sydney restaurant in 2013 with Phillipa Sage, the events organiser with whom he allegedly had a year-long affair in 2011. Ms Sage has been regularly at Clarkson's side during his recent suspension from the BBC . Burning bridges: The ‘Burma Special’ Top Gear episode in 2014. After allegations of a racial slur involving the word ‘slope’, Ofcom upholds viewers’ complaints — all two of them. Clarkson has been at the centre of numerous rows on a range of subjects during the show's career . Bad verse: When out-takes of an ill-judged ‘eeny-meeny’ gag leak out in which critics claim to hear the ‘n’ word, BBC bosses warn Jeremy he is on borrowed time. Clarkson had previously issued a robust denial of the allegation, telling his 3.2 million Twitter followers: 'I did not use the N-word. Never use it.' But in a video statement posted online later, he begged for forgiveness, saying that he had tried to obscure the word when reciting the rhyme but that his efforts to do so 'weren't quite good enough' Battle of the River Plate Number Plate: The car which spawned a pitched battle in Argentina and sent Top Gear packing. Argentina will not be crying after yesterday’s news of Clarkson’s BBC exit. Many felt the number plate was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War and Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, met with BBC director of television Danny Cohen to demand a public apology .

"Passengers on a packed train were left shocked after an announcer said fat people should not sit down because of a lack of space. The train was full of commuters when a member of staff reportedly said: 'We are going to be like sardines on this train, so can I ask that only slim people sit on the three-seaters. 'If you are fat then it is simply not going to work.' An employee on a busy South West trains told 'slim people' to sit in three seaters but said for 'fat people' it 'simply is not going to work' One angry passenger on the service, which was leaving Basingstoke, Hampshire, said: 'I am not necessarily a big person but most people are larger than those seats anyway. 'It's pretty disgusting. I would get fired if I said that at my work.' South West Trains apologised, saying that if the comment had been made it was 'unacceptable' but that the train guard was also being light-hearted. A statement from South West Trains said: ' All passengers are welcome on board our trains. Our guard was aware this particular service was very busy and, in a light-hearted way, pointed out that some middle seat spaces might not be comfortable for passengers with a similar build to herself. 'This was in no way intended as a slight on any customers and the majority of passengers on the train took the comments in the spirit in which they were intended. 'However, like ourselves, she is very sorry if any passengers were offended by her remarks. 'We run some of the busiest trains in the country and we appreciate that space on some of our trains is limited. 'To provide extra space and seats for our customers, we are in the process of investing £250m in extra carriages and new trains.' One commuter described the announcement as 'disgusting'.

"It may have always been on his mind, but country singer Willie Nelson only recently announced he plans to create and sell his own brand of marijuana. The singer's personal brand of weed will be called Willie's Reserve and it could be available as soon as 2016. Nelson, 81, revealed his plans at the Heartbreaker Banquet, a fundraiser which is held during South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. Scroll down for video . Willi Nelson, 81, revealed his pot plans at a fundraiser during South by Southwest in Austin, Texas . The country singer will create a brand of marijuana called Willie's Reserve and bring it to market in 2016 . Brand will represent Nelson's 'personal morals and convictions' and be sold from 'anti-Walmart' storefronts . After Nelson let the cat out of the bag, his spokesman revealed details about Willie's Reserve to the Daily Beast. The brand will represent Nelson's 'personal morals and convictions' and it will be sold from storefronts that feel like 'the anti-Walmart', according to Bowman. The plan is to open stores in states like Colorado, Washington and Alaska. Bowman said: 'He wants it to be something that's reflective of his passion. 'Ultimately, it's his. But it was developed by his family, and their focus on environmental and social issues, and in particular this crazy war on drugs, and trying to be a bright light amongst this trail as we're trying to extract ourselves from the goo of prohibition.' He added that growers who meet Nelson's standards for quality will have the chance to peddle their wares next to Willie's Reserve. Bowman said: 'Let's just call it the anti-Walmart model. 'Personally, internally, that's what we call it. 'A certain standard by which growers have to account for carbon and such, in a way that empowers small growers who are doing the right thing. 'It will be like when you walk into a Whole Foods store.' Bob Marley's family capitalized on the deceased reggae legend's popularity by announcing a 'global cannabis brand' called Marley Natural, according to the Cannabist. The brand, which is slated to launch later this year, will 'honor the life and legacy of Bob Marley as well as his belief in the benefits of cannabis' by offering 'heirloom Jamaican cannabis strains' inspired by those the singer enjoyed.

"Samantha Cameron is to hit the campaign trail as part of a Tory strategy to keep her husband in Number 10. Conservative strategists believe the PM's wife could be a secret weapon in the battle for re-election on May 7. The couple appeared together yesterday in the first of many campaign visits, but David Cameron admitted that the pressures of wooing voters means their regular date nights will have to be put on hold. Scroll down for video . David and Samantha Cameron are to appear together regularly during the election campaign to woo floating voters . Mrs Cameron has secured a broadly positive press since moving into Number 10 five years ago, largely by keeping below the radar. Many of her appearances have been linked to her charities, including Save The Children, Comic Relief and Tickets For Troops. She has also championed the creative industries, hosting events in Downing Street to mark London Fashion Week. But she is now expected to make a series of more stridently political interventions, after using a BBC interview last week to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister. She said: 'He's definitely for my mind the best man for the job. 'I hope that me and the family help him to keep things in perspective - keep him grounded - help him to pace himself over the next eight weeks.' And yesterday they were filmed together discussing their hospital visits with son Ivan, who died in 2009. The couple appeared at Salford Royal Hospital on Saturday, where they spoke to patient Tom Lawrence about their hospital visits with son Ivan, who died in 2009 . Mrs Cameron was on the front row for her husbands keynote speech to the Conservative Spring Forum . Mrs Cameron managed to avoid being caught pulling an embarrassing expression, something her husband did not acheive . They were seen speaking to a patient during a visit to Salford's Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. The PM said: 'When our son was very ill, we often went into hospital and it is very difficult to get out at the weekend.' Mrs Cameron added: 'On a Friday, if we thought there was any chance that we could get home, I was like: 'We've got to get out this afternoon'.' The Tory leader has made much of his regular 'date nights', slipping out of Downing Street to visit trendy restaurants like Kitty Fisher's in Mayfair and the celeb haunt Chiltern Firehouse. But the nights out will have to be shelved while the couple focus on winning votes. Mrs Cameron used an appearance in a BBC interview at the couple's Oxfordshire home last week to back her husband's bid to remain as Prime Minister . Mrs Cameron has also championed the creative industries, hosting events in Downing Street to mark London Fashion Week and often appearing on the front row at high profile shows . Unafraid to make a spectacle of herself, in 2013 she posed in a red wig to promote Comic Relief in her Downing Street kitchen . During the five years of the coalition, many of Mrs Cameron's media appearances have been linked to charity work, including this visit with Save The Children to a refugee settlement in Lebanon, close to the Syria border in March 2013 . He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I think that will probably be a bit testing. I think there won't be much time for some of those things. 'Samantha's going to be on the campaign trail with me. She has also got other things she has to do, including making sure the children make it to school every day.' But he played down the idea that he spends too much time 'chillaxing' instead of focussing on running the country. 'I work bloody hard,' he insisted. 'I'm normally up before six at my kitchen table working away. I certainly was today.' But he went on to add: 'I do try to make sure that [I] don't get exhausted. I try to get a decent amount of sleep. I try to spend some time with my family. 'My view is, the most important thing as Prime Minister is trying to make the right judgments. In order to make good judgments, you need good advice, you need good principles and you need a clear head and you need to have a sense of equilibrium.'","Samantha Cameron to make regularly appearances on the campaign trail .

"John Davies: Police are still working to track down the conman . A flamboyant conman who funded an extravagant lifestyle by swindling £750,000 from struggling businesses has gone missing after being convicted of fraud. John Davies, 53, of Milton Keynes, left a trail of misery in his wake, with 'numerous' people losing their jobs and companies as a result of his actions. After his six-week trial police detailed how he had lived a 'flamboyant lifestyle on the back of despicable crimes', buying a house complete with the latest cinema system and a luxury kitchen. On Wednesday, he was found guilty in his absence of 12 counts of fraud by breach of trust. Police have since issued a warrant for his arrest. The court case, at Aylesbury Crown Court in Buckinghamshire, related to Davies' dealings with nine different companies where he gained in excess of £750,000. He was convicted of 11 counts by a unanimous jury decision, and one by a majority verdict. The court was told how he had spent his ill-gotten gains on a luxury lifestyle, including more than £70,000 on a new Range Rover and foreign holidays to Barbados and Las Vegas. Davies, of Dean Forest Way, Broughton, Milton Keynes, claimed to be an insolvency and business adviser but he was not licensed. Between 2007 and 2013 he targeted distressed companies, claiming he could help restructure their debts. But although he often advised companies they should go into liquidation or administration, he would delay doing so in order to gain control of companies' remaining assets which he used for his own personal gain. The prosecution said he gained his victims' trust and then took the money that was due to the company creditors which he then spent on himself. His swindles - carried out in Theale in Berkshire, Kent, and Northamptonshire - meant people lost their jobs, livelihoods and companies. Thames Valley Police Economic Crime Unit spent more than two years collating evidence against him. Following the trial investigating officer Detective Constable Stephanie Burleigh said: 'I am very grateful to all the victims and witnesses who took the time to come to court and give statements to support the proceedings against this serial fraudster. 'Company fraud is not a victimless crime, Davies ruined many livelihoods and Thames Valley Police take these crimes seriously. Davies kept a lavish £70,000 Range Rover along with other trappings of the jet-set lifestyle (file photo) The fraudster used his ill-gotten money to pay for luxury holidays to Las Vegas (left) and Barbados (right) 'Davies has led a flamboyant lifestyle on the back of these despicable crimes which have caused so much misery up and down the country. 'He is an accomplished and manipulative con-artist who does not care about the consequences of his actions. 'I appeal to anyone who knows where he is to contact the police immediately so that he can serve his sentence.' His conviction comes two years after being cleared of murdering his wife during their honeymoon to India. Colette Davies, 39, from Bridgend, was found dead at the bottom of a 80ft ravine in a remote part of the country in February 2004. In 2011 he was charged with murder and two counts of fraud, relating to allegations he fraudulently claimed £132,000 from a life insurance policy. In March 2013 he was cleared of all charges at Cardiff Crown Court when the prosecution produced no evidence against him.","John Davies, 53, of Milton Keynes, ruined lives to live a playboy lifestyle .

"A smart cooking device that uses 'satellite technology' for precision-temperature cooking has been unveiled. The £330 ($499) Cinder Sensing Cooker looks like a sandwich toaster but is used to cook a variety foods, including steak. An app tells you when your food is done - and even stores it for up to two hours if you aren't ready to eat just yet. A San Francisco-based company has developed the Cinder Sensing Cooker (shown). It uses 'satellite technology' to cook food to precise temperatures . The boss of the San Francisco-based company, Eric Norman, was previously an engineer at Lockheed Martin - known for its involvement in the space industry. Mr Norman said they ‘drew upon rocket science used in spacecraft to create a wholly down-to-Earth cooking experience.’ For example, the materials and the structural design were selected specifically to optimise heat flow, while the device can cook food to very precise specifications. ‘Like controlling the motion of a satellite, Cinder’s predictive control system and sensor placement are carefully tuned to avoid overshoot,’ the company said. Dimensions: 18 x 12 x 5 inches (46 x 30 x 13cm) Weight: 12 lbs (5kg) Electric: 1800W at 120V . Max temperature: 290°C (550°F) Connectivity: WiFi and Bluetooth . Mr Norman said the product enables people to ‘combine the best parts of home cooking - the creative and sensory experience - with the best part of fine dining, which is the perfectly cooked, delicious food.’ To cook food, Cinder has an enclosed chamber and two non-stick aluminium cooking plates. These are equipped with highly accurate sensors that achieve and maintain the precise temperature to cook a particular food. This can either be calculated by the machine, or selected according to the cook’s preferences. The company said it can ‘prepare a perfect, medium-rare New York Strip steak, cooked evenly edge-to-edge and with a beautiful seared exterior, in 28 minutes.’ The user selects what food is cooking via an app. The device then uses two plates to heat it to the right temperature. It can also store cooked food for up to two hours ready to serve . The app will send you reminders to let you know when your food is done and the user can also control the cooker remotely using any connected device. It is currently only available for iOS . To cook food in Cinder, the user simply places the food inside and closes the lid. They then select what they are cooking - for example ‘NY Strip, Medium Rare’ - in an accompanying app. It  reaches its target temperature ‘within seconds’ and then maintains this until the food also reaches its correct temperature. Once cooked, the machine can then keep the food at its serving temperature for two hours. ‘Because the temperature inside Cinder is so precise and remains constant, it is impossible to overcook or undercook the steak,’ the company claimed. 'To monitor the temperature of the food, Cinder uses a ‘patent-pending virtual-thermometer algorithm.’ Cinder is available now for pre-order, and will begin shipping in early 2016. Mr Norman said the product enables people to ‘combine the best parts of home cooking - the creative and sensory experience - with the best part of fine dining, which is the perfectly cooked, delicious food’ The £330 ($499) Cinder Sensing Cooker (shown) looks like a sandwich toaster but is instead used to cook a variety foods including steak and salmon.

"Father Tony McSweeney, 68, watched as care home manager John Stingemore, his paedophile friend, fondled a teenager in the shower of Grafton Close Children’s Home . The 'Fat Vicar' who conducted Frank Bruno's wedding has been jailed for three years for abusing a boy at a children's home. Father Anthony McSweeney was locked up after the court rejected his claim that his 20st size meant he could not have molested boys as they sat on his lap. The 68-year-old, who officiated at the boxer's wedding to ex-wife Laura, watched as care home manager John Stingemore, his paedophile friend, fondled a teenager in the shower of Grafton Close Children’s Home in Hounslow, west London, between 1979 and 1981. The Catholic clergyman, once part-time chaplain at Norwich City FC, also collected vile child porn over ‘decades’ and was caught with a drawer crammed with sex toys by his cleaner, Southwark Crown Court heard. McSweeney was leading the congregation at St George’s Church in north Norwich when the claims against him emerged in 2013. He was originally charged with Stingemore, 72, but the care home manager died weeks before the trial was due to start. McSweeney’s 15-year-old victim remembered a ‘massive’ trainee priest who was a ‘right bulk’ visiting Grafton Close. Together with Stingemore, McSweeney forced the young teenager to expose himself to them and touched him under the pretence of making sure he was ‘clean’ four or five times. ‘This was joint enterprise by both men to use the victim for their own sexual gratification,’ said prosecutor Sarah Plaschkes QC. ‘On a number of occasions this defendant, together with the officer in charge of the home John Stingemore, would be present when the victim was in the bathroom. ‘Mr Stingemore would touch him by, in his words, lifting his balls and making him bend over.’ The men groomed the ‘vulnerable’ and ‘isolated’ boy by using the washing routine to ‘confuse the child’ and to hide their true motivation. Both pensioners were accused of targeting children while Stingemore, of Stonehouse Drive, St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, was in charge of the council-run home. The disgraced clergyman was found guilty of one count of indecent assault. Together with Stingemore (pictured), McSweeney forced the young teenager to expose himself to them and touched him under the pretence of making sure he was ‘clean’ four or five times . The morbidly obese Catholic priest argued he could not have molested boys as they sat on his lap because he was too fat to fit a teen on him . He was further found guilty of three charges of making indecent photographs of children after sickening images of sexual abuse were discovered on his Dell laptop dating between 2012 and 2013. He was cleared of three counts of indecent assault and one of taking an indecent photograph of a child relating to two boys who lived in the home he volunteered in. McSweeney sat open-mouthed as he was jailed for three years for his crimes. Judge McCreath explained the clergyman ’was prosecuted and convicted on a joint enterprise basis and on clear evidence that the touching of the child was done with approval and encouragement and for his sexual gratification.’ McSweeny was also made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order which restricts his access to boys between 12 and 17 years old and monitors his internet use. In 1998 McSweeney nearly lost his career when his cleaner discovered his stash of sex toys, truncheons and pornographic videos - featuring boys between 14 and 16 years old - at St Peter’s Catholic Church in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex. He was originally threatened that he would be “banished” from the priesthood, but after around six months was quietly moved to a new parish, St George’s, in Norwich.","Father Tony McSweeney, 68, watched as a friend repeatedly fondled boy .

"Michelle Hughes has defied the threat of a terror attack by wearing her cadet uniform to school despite being warned against the idea . A teenager has defied the threat of a terror attack by wearing her cadet uniform to school despite being warned against the idea. Michelle Hughes was told to carry her Army uniform in a bag when travelling to and from school after fears of a Woolwich copycat attack on soldiers. But the proud 17-year-old cadet ignored advice, insisting she had not been brought up to be ‘scared of anything’. Her show of courage comes after children in cadet forces across the country were warned in December not to wear their uniform outside school. Pupils were also told to carry out searches of training areas, ranges and accommodation before setting up camp while on trips. Individual units were told to ensure with ‘immediate effect’ that ‘appropriate security measures’ were put into place in all detachments. Michelle’s mother, Rose Hughes, said: ‘I am not going to be afraid of evil frustrated people. That is the way I brought up my children. I brought them up to work hard and achieve and fulfil their potential. ‘There are crazy people out there who take out their frustrations in life on other people, but this country is peaceful and I do not want my children to be afraid. ‘Let the terrorists be afraid, they are the ones who should hide.’ When the guidance was issued by some units, a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) source said it was a ‘terrible shame’ that children were no longer able to wear their uniforms proudly on the streets. Andrew Halls, headmaster of King’s College School in Wimbledon, south west London, wrote to the parents of pupils who belong to its CCF, to advise that concerned pupils should carry their uniforms in a bag when travelling to school. Miss Hughes, a single mother, wrote back to say her daughter would not bow to the threat. Michelle, who has 12 A* GCSEs and has represented England at athletics, told the Sunday Times: ‘I saw the email from the headmaster and so did my mum, but I was going to wear the CCF uniform anyway. ‘I don’t really feel at risk. My mum wrote back to the school saying she had not brought us up to be scared of anything.’ Some schools have been strict with guidance and have told pupils they must not wear their uniform in public (file picture) Her mother, from Essex, added: ‘It is a wonderful privilege to be alive and to live in a country like Britain. ‘Nothing is risk free, but on the whole this country is safe. I want my children to be on the right side of life, to do the right thing and fulfil their potential. The only thing you have to be afraid of in life is fear.’ Michelle, who was previously a member of the Air Training Corps, is one of a number of CCF members at her school who are not prepared to hide their uniforms in public. The teenager hopes to secure a place at an Ivy League university in America and train to be a doctor, possibly with the Royal Air Force. Mr Halls said he felt he had to pass on the army’s advice, but respected the decision by most of his pupils to ignore it. He said: ‘I respect Michelle’s mum’s message. I think it is admirable, but I would not want to enforce it if anyone did not feel comfortable with it. ‘What would be really awful would be if we packed in the CCF because we thought it was two risky.’ Some schools have been stricter with the guidance and told pupils they must not wear their uniform in public. Last year serving soldiers were also told not to wear their uniform outside barracks amid fears of an another attack similar to the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich . Richard Cairns, the headmaster of Brighton College, said his pupils changed into their CCF uniforms only after they arrived at school. He said: ‘You’ve got to put the potential risk to children first.’ Thomas Garnier, the headmaster of Pangbourne College in Berkshire, who is in charge of liaison between schools with CCFs and the army, said it was for individual head teachers to interpret advice from the army. He said: ‘Given the different situations schools are in, a school in an inner city might take a different view to a school in the country where pupils board.’ He said the decision to ignore guidance did ‘seem brave’, adding: ‘They have a right to say they are not afraid of this threat.’ A CCF source said in December: ‘It is such a terrible shame that children are being told not to wear uniforms. It is sad they can’t proudly walk the streets.’ Last year serving soldiers were also told not to wear their uniform outside barracks amid fears of an another attack similar to the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in 2013. Rigby was wearing a top bearing the logo of Help for Heroes, the charity for injured service personnel, when he was attacked. The threat level for the armed forces was raised from ‘substantial’ to ‘severe’ at the end of last year, meaning a terrorist attack on military personnel is highly likely.","Michelle Hughes was told to carry her Cadet uniform in her backpack .

"Her turn as a cold character in Four Weddings And A Funeral and a villain in Only God Forgives made her a household name - and one of the world's most in-demand actresses. But, at 54, Kristin Scott Thomas says she's fed up of playing these 'cold' characters and is now swapping the cinema for the stage. Speaking to the Radio Times, the acclaimed actress said: 'I got fed up with being asked to do the same thing, playing cold, wicked bitches'. Kristin Scott Thomas, who has made the move from the silver screen to the stage, says she got fed up with being asked to play cold, wicked women . The mother-of-three added: 'I felt like the camera was stealing bits of me and the end product was a mosaic, just snippets. If I cried on film, they weren't my tears.' The British-French actress is now vowing to make theatre her priority and she's kicking things off in May by portraying the Queen in The Audience. She takes over the reins from Dame Helen Mirren in Peter Morgan's show, which tells the tale of the royal's weekly meetings with various prime ministers. Indeed, Kristin and Helen now have more in common than just a shared role; Kristin was  named a Dame in the New Year's Honours List, alongside Joan Collins and Sheridan Smith. Speaking to the Radio Times, the acclaimed actress said: 'I got fed up with being asked to do the same thing, playing cold, wicked bitches' One of her most celebrated roles was in Four Weddings and a Funeral alongside Simon Callow, Charlotte Coleman, John Hannah and Hugh Grant . In the past, the star has said that she considers herself to be more French than English after moving to Paris to become an actress at the age of 19 and bringing up her three children there. The actress is nonetheless diverting her attention back to her British roots for the foreseeable future after announcing that she had quit films in 2014 and taking on a string of West End roles. Speaking to The Guardian about her latest career move last year, she said: 'I just suddenly thought, I cannot cope with another film. 'I realised I've done the things I know how to do so many times in different languages, and I just suddenly thought, I can't do it any more. I'm bored by it. So I'm stopping.' At 54, the brunette discussed her place in the industry and the brick wall she's facing as a 'woman in her fifties.' 'I'm sort of, as the French would say, ""stuck between two chairs"",' she continued. 'Because I'm no longer 40 and sort of a seductress, and I'm not yet a granny.'

"Tony 'the Fridge' Phoenix-Morrison has denied allegations he assaulted four members of a family . A runner who has raised more than £100,000 for charity by completing marathons with a fridge strapped to his back has been accused of assaulting a family-of-four. Tony Phoenix-Morrison has become well known for running hundreds of miles with the 42kg weight and has also been named Fundraiser of the Year at the Pride of Britain Awards. The 50-year-old grandfather appeared at Sunderland Magistrates' Court under the name Anthony Morrison and was charged with four counts of assault against four members of the Mallaby family. He was also accused of using violence for the purpose of securing entry into their home, knowing that there was someone present on those premises opposed to his entry. Morrison, of Hebburn, South Tyneside, denied all the charges when he appeared at court today. The dedicated runner is said to have seen his business fail as he relentlessly pursued his charity work over the last few years. He has covered more than 1,000 miles with a fridge strapped to his back, raising more than £100,000 for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. And last year his efforts were recognised when he was named Fundraiser of the Year at the Pride of Britain Awards. He was also nominated as endurance fundraiser of the year at the JustGiving Awards for completing the London Marathon twice in 24 hours - a feat which raised more than £10,000 for Cancer Research UK. Morrison has completed the Great North Run, and regularly ran 13.1 miles with the fridge on his back every morning between Newcastle and South Shields to help him train for his charity challenges. He had been due to stand trial but his solicitor, Chris Wilson, applied for more time. Morrison has raised more than £100,000 for charity by running hundreds of miles with a fridge on his back and is seen here on the 13.1 mile training route he used to do every morning, with the fridge strapped to him . The charity fundraiser completed the London Marathon twice in 24 hours and has run more than 1,000 miles . Mr Wilson said 'exceptional circumstances' meant the trial could not go ahead because Morrison had 'buried his head in the sand', and he had stopped communicating with his legal team, according to the Shields Gazette. Mr Wilson told the court that Morrison had lost his business as a result of his commitment to his charitable work. He said the grandfather had stopped opening his mail and said he had 'disengaged from society.' Mr Morrison was named Fundraiser of the Year at the Pride of Britain awards for his charity efforts . But Morrison told the court: 'I wasn't burying my head in the sand. It was confusion.' The bench adjourned the trial until Wednesday, September 2, and warned him that the case may proceed in his absence should he not turn up. Morrison was released on bail on the condition that he does not contact prosecution witnesses or go to the family's home again.

"The Pentagon wants to spend billions on three new Air Force One planes to replace the existing two Boeing 747s currently used by the president. The existing planes have been in service since 1991 and the military argue that they're getting too old and need to be replaced. They've requested $102 million from Congress this year to help buy the planes, with the figure growing to more than $3 billion over the next five years. Scroll down for video . The Pentagon is set to spend billions on three new Air Force One planes to replace the existing two Boeing 747s currently used by the president, pictured above . The military has requested $102 million from Congress this year to buy the planes, with the figure growing to more than $3 billion over the next five years . Those numbers don't include the final three years of the project, reports CBS News. While some may question whether taxpayers can afford to buy the new planes, Air Force Col. Amy McCain argues that they can't afford not to. 'It's the only 747-200 left in the United States that is flying. So it costs a lot more time and money to keep that airplane flying than it used to. It's actually cheaper in the long run to replace it,' she said. 'The top priority is an affordable aircraft that will meet the presidential requirements,' said McCain, who is in charge of ordering the new Air Force One. 'We're buying up to three. It depends on all the availability of having two airplanes available for the president at any one time.' The Air Force hopes to sign the first contract with Boeing later this year. The goal is to have the new planes flying the president by 2023.

"After an NFL season to forget, Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson celebrated his 30th birthday in style on Saturday with an extravagant Arabic-themed party in his home state of Texas. Peterson is currently at the center of much speculation about who he’ll be playing for next season, but he put all that behind him at the weekend and took his own life into his hands as he entered his birthday bash on the back of camel. The elaborate celebrations included costumes, an ice bar, a cake shaped like a middle eastern palace and a special guest appearance by actor Jamie Foxx who can be seen hamming it up on the dance-floor and in the DJ booth in cellphone footage that's appeared on social media since. Scroll down for video . Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson celebrated his 30th birthday in style on Saturday by entering the extravagant Arabic-themed party on the back of a camel . Peterson, posing above with one birthday guest, celebrated turning 30 on Saturday with a no-expense-spared party in his home state of Texas . The big 3-0 typically signals the beginning of the end for an NFL running back, but Peterson didn’t let that spoil his fun on Saturday night. The Vikings' all-time leading rusher appeared in only one game in 2014 because of the child abuse case that involved injuries to his 4-year-old son. He was indicted on September 11, 2014, by a Montgomery County, Texas, grand jury on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child that occurred on May 18, 2014. He is accused of beating his four-year-old son with a tree branch, which Peterson consistently referred to as a 'switch', causing severe welts and bleeding on the child's back, legs, buttocks, genitals and ankles. In their initial response, the Vikings deactivated Peterson for a single game. Peterson’s 2014 NFL season was over after arbitrator Shyam Das ruled in favor of the NFL on November 18, 2014, saying, 'the league can keep Adrian Peterson on the commissioner’s exempt list,' effectively terminating the Minnesota Vikings running back's season. Actor Jamie Foxx was one of the guests in attendance for Peterson's party and he can be seen hamming in up on the dancefloor and in the DJ booth in cellphone footage that has appeared on social media since . The elaborate celebrations included costumes, an ice bar and a cake shaped like a middle eastern palace . His suspension, ordered by Commissioner Roger Goodell through at least April 15, was tabled after a federal judge knocked down the NFL arbitrator's denial of Peterson's appeal. Peterson was returned to the special exempt list, pending further developments on the legal front. He has three years remaining on his Vikings contract and is owed $12.75 million next season, but relations between the two parties are currently described as tenuous. While team officials have said they want Peterson back, he has questioned their commitment in the wake of the suspension controversy. The Vikings' all-time leading rusher appeared in only one game in 2014 because of the child abuse case that involved injuries to his 4-year-old son . In an interview with ESPN last month, he called the collaboration between the Vikings and the NFL to place him on paid leave the week after he was indicted in Texas 'an ambush.' Peterson's agent, Ben Dogra, said on Friday that he declined an invitation from Vikings general manager Rick Spielman to meet over dinner during the NFL owners meetings in Arizona next week. The Texan has featured in six Pro Bowl selections, run for 10,190 yards and scored 86 touchdowns since joining the NFL. He has only played for the Vikings since his league debut in 2007. In 2012, Peterson rushed for 2,097 yards, finishing nine yards shy of breaking Eric Dickerson's all-time record for running yardage in a single NFL season.

"Megan Crofts and Eric Hewlett have booked their ceremony at a new venue being created by the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh . A bride-to-be is so set on having her wedding at her dream location that she has booked it for the big day, before it has even been built. Megan Crofts, 32, and her fiance Eric Hewlett, 36, hope to become the first couple to marry in a new venue being created by the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh. The pair are planning to tie the knot on May 23, just eight weeks away,but their dream venue is yet to be fully built, still has workmen on site, and is 370 miles from their home. Megan booked the venue despite never having the opportunity to tour around it in a hope that it will be completed just in time for her big day. She says that she has pictured exactly where the ceremony will take place, where the cake will be cut, and where she will have her first dance with Eric. Megan, a doctor who now lives in Bristol, insists she is confident everything will go as planned on the big day. She said: 'It may seem a little risky to book a wedding in a venue that we haven't yet seen and is so far from home. 'But the team at the venue have made everything so easy, so we know we are in excellent hands.' Despite having complete confidence in her unfinished venue Megan admits that there have been a few difficulties with planning. 'Of course, some aspects of the planning have been difficult, for example, figuring out flowers and themes was a little tricky because we haven't seen the interior or any colour scheme. 'Living so far away has also been a little tricky, but the team at the venue have been great at liaising with my parents.' Megan will not be the first in her family to celebrate a milestone at the Royal college of Surgeons, as her father, Trevor, is a fellow of the College of Surgeons. Megan says that it was celebrating with her father that first set the idea for her unfinished venue into motion. She said: 'A retirement party was held for my dad at the Royal College and it was such a stunning setting that I always had it in mind as a potential wedding venue. The exterior of the Royal College of Surgeons, which is currently undergoing building work . Megan has booked The Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh as her venue despite being unable to view it . Megan and Eric have had to plan every detail of their wedding 'blind' in a hope that the venue will be complete in time for their big day. Pictured: Artist impression of the building . Megan continued: 'When we heard the new venue was under construction, we asked the coordinators to show us the plans and we were really sold on what the venue had to offer. 'So after a few sneak peeks of the space during its renovation, we could really see the venue's potential as the ideal setting for our wedding.' The new events and conference venue was formerly a language school, and will be accessible through a pillared entrance opposite the city's Festival Theatre. Megan first fell in love with the venue when celebrating her father's retirement in the old college building . Scott Mitchell, the College's commercial director, says that hosting a wedding will be a great way to unveil the building. He said: 'We are thrilled to have a wedding already booked at the venue. 'It is the perfect start for us and we'll be doing everything we possibly can to make sure it gives the perfect start to Megan and Eric's marriage.'","Megan Crofts and Eric Hewlett have booked their wedding ceremony in the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh .

"Revealing satellite images show how Syria has been flooded with darkness since the beginning of the civil war with 83 per cent of the country's lights being extinguished since 2011. In a picture taken four years ago, the nation's heavily-populated cities are clearly visible due to the  dense cluster of lights they emit. But in a photo taken this month, major cities including the war-torn country's capital Damascus, have all but disappeared from sight due to destruction, power shortages and people fleeing their homes. Scroll down for video . Then: A satellite picture taken of Syria before civil war began in 2011 shows the country's major cities emitting a dense cluster of lights at night . Now: Four years later and 83 per cent of the country's night-time light has disappeared due to  destruction, power shortages and people fleeing their homes . Scientists based in China analyzed night-time satellite images and were stunned by the proportion of lights that have disappeared. The study was backed by 130 international NGOs that are part of the #withSyria coalition, which aims to raise awareness about the ongoing conflict. Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who briefed the media on the results of the analysis, said: 'What is happening on the ground in Syria is a humanitarian and human rights catastrophe of the first order. 'I believe it is the single most important issue in the Middle East today, yet it sometimes feels as though the world has forgotten about it. Destruction: Once Syria's commercial hub, Aleppo has been devastated by fighting and has lost 97 per cent of its night-time light . The war-torn city of Aleppo, pictured last week, barely shows on the satellite images after four years of civil conflict . 'The international community can and must supply more intense political pressure to stop the violence and human rights abuses that are fueling this crisis.' More than 200,000 people have been killed and another four million have fled the country since the conflict  between rebel groups and President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. In this period, the Islamic State has seized control of large swathes of territory in their bid to establish a caliphate across the Middle East. One of the most prominent eclipses depicted in the satellite images has taken place in the northern city of Aleppo where fierce fighting between rebels and Government forces has decreased the night-time lights emitted by 97 per cent. In Government-held cities such as Damascus, the change has been less dramatic with a 35 per cent reduction in light output. Also affected: The nation's capital Damascus has also been hit by fighting since 2011 with satellite imagery showing how night-time light has been reduced by 35 per cent . People fleeing their homes, power shortages and physical destruction can all contribute to the decline in night light, which offers a unique glimpse into the destruction wrought by the violence in Syria. According to research leader Dr. Xi LI, the fall in night light over the course of the conflict is similar to what was seen in Rwanda over the course of the genocide in 1994. The scientist said 'the night light data never tells lies' - but admitted that even he had been shocked at their findings. He added: 'More night lights lost means more displaced persons.. destruction of infrastructure and power shortages. 'Satellite imagery is the most objective source of data showing the devastation of Syria on a national scale. 'Taken from 500 miles above the Earth, these images help us understand the suffering and fear experienced by ordinary Syrians every day as their country is destroyed around them.' Condemned findings: Former British foreign secretary David Miliband (left) and former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (right) have both expressed their sorrow at seeing the satellite images . Former British foreign secretary David Miliband tweeted about the research findings today . Former British foreign secretary David Miliband tweeted about the research findings, saying: 'For 4 yrs, Syria’s people have been plunged into the dark: fearful, grieving for friends lost & the country they once knew. 'Syrians deserve much better from int'l community. It's past time to show that we will work with them to turn the lights back on' In a press conference, Mr Miliband, no the president of the International Rescue Committee, added: 'Syria is entering the dark ages, literally and metaphorically'.","Satellite photos show how country has been affected by four years of war .

Superintendent of Schools Emanuele Triggiano (pictured) called the incident a 'terrible thing' and added, 'The most important thing is to make sure that the child is in our prayers' The note, which ended up in the hands of an adult in the room, may have had something to do with a dispute about a chess game the boy had with another student earlier in the day. A person in the class reported witnessing the fight, according to reports. Sources have told The Jersey Record the letter was not a suicide note.

"A poker player who cheated casinos across the country out of tens of thousands of pounds by making almost invisible dents and bends in cards has been jailed for 18 months. Mihai Lacatos, a Romanian national, lied his way into casinos he had been banned from by producing fake ID cards and driving licences. Once inside, the unemployed 61-year-old would sit at card tables for hours, deftly making marks in the cards before using them to work out his opponents' hands. Sentenced: Mihai Lacatos, a Romanian national, would sit at casino tables for hours deftly making the marks in the cards before using them to work out his opponents' hands. He was jailed for 18 months today . The technique allowed him to swindle the Playboy Club in Mayfair, London out of £43,400 in just one week. Lacatos was arrested at the Rubicon Casino on Regent Street, Northampton, in March 2014 after staff recognised him and raised the alarm. After his arrest, Lacatos attempted to flee to Romania from Luton Airport but was caught in the departure lounge by detectives on 20 November 2014. He admitted 14 fraud offences and four further charges of possessing false ID documents which date back to 2008. He was jailed for 18 months at Southwark Crown Court today. His conviction is the one of the first for ‘card marking’ - a technique which is thought to have made the skilled fraudster hundreds of thousands of pounds over his six-year spree. Lacatos fleeced customers at casinos across the country - including in Leicester, Salford, Nottingham and Birmingham. Lacatos, pictured bottom right at a card table in Playboy Club in Mayfair, London, used slight of hand to subtly bend and dent cards at the poker table and was so skilled that his cheating went unnoticed for years . He used slight of hand to subtly bend and dent cards at the poker table and was so skilled that his cheating went unnoticed for years. The bends and dents helped him identify what other players at the table for three card games were holding. Prosecutor Michelle Fawcett said: ‘The defendant is a well-known casino cheat. He is known to mark cards at three card poker thereby causing loss to operators across the UK. ‘To facilitate his entry into the various casinos, knowing he had been previously banned from such establishments, the allegations behind the fraud in this case are that he used false names to register with the various casinos supporting his applications with counterfeit documentation on every occasion.’ Scam: The bends and dents, pictured, helped Lacatos identify what other players at the table were holding . She added: ‘Over the week of using the false identity at the Playboy Casino in London, it was discovered that the defendant had cheated at three card poker by bending or marking the cards. ‘The cards were notably aces and this bending of the cards enabled him to know when the card were being dealt. ‘The CCTV showed that the defendant noticeably increased his bets of £10 to £20 to £100 to £200 per game. ‘CCTV also showed that the defendant always sat at the first box position which is nearest to the shuffle machine at the card table. Lacatos spent hours sitting at casino tables for making tiny marks and creases in the cards. He would always sit at the first box position, which is nearest to the card shuffle machine and the table. This seat meant he was given the best possible view of the cards as they left the machine and fell into the dealing cradle. The poker player would then watch carefully as the pack was dealt, noting the creases or marks which revealed which card it was. ‘This ensured he could clearly see the cards as they left the machine and fell into the dealing cradle,’ she said. ‘He was able to take a sum of £43,400 from the casino in total. That figure includes winning his bets back and the profit made by cheating. ‘As a result of these findings the matter was reported to the police, the packs of cards were handed over and were analysed and were found to have been marked. ‘That caused further enquiries to be made and an investigation showed that the defendant had been involved in various other incidents around the UK and had gained access to various casinos by using further false identities.' Lacatos’ placed bets worth £25,200 at the Playboy club and won them all back plus a profit of £18,200. Ms Fawcett continued: ‘Between 29 March 2014 and 31 March 2014 he joined the Northampton Rubicon casino again with a false identity. ‘He was recognised in that casino however on the 31 March 2014 - the police were notified, they arrested the defendant in the casino.’ Lacatos was cautioned and later bailed to return to Charing Cross police station for a full interview with an interpreter. But he failed to attend and offended  twice more while on bail. Lacastos targeted the Playboy Club in Mayfair in London and cheated players out of more than £40,000 . ‘The defendant was finally arrested on 20 November 2014 at Luton airport whilst about to leave the UK on a flight to Romania,’ said Ms Fawcett. Police seized £3,500 from Lacatos who was carrying his own passport and ID card at the time. Stuart Stevens, for Lacatos, said the married cheat was from the ‘very, very poor’ region of southern Romania. Lacatos has simply printed bogus Hungarian and Romanian identity cards from the internet and laminated them. ‘He tells me there is not a big check at casinos - they want your money so they let you in,’ said Mr Stevens. ‘He realises his time of making this money is over, he wanted to get back to Romania, to his family. He appreciates just how serious this is and he throws himself on the mercy of the court.’ Sentencing Lacatos at Southwark Crown Court, Recorder Alexander Layton QC said Lacatos ‘deliberately planned’ his crimes and used a ‘large number’ of false names. ‘After you had been arrested you attempted to flee the country, two of the offences were committed while you were on bail and you have previous convictions in Romania for offences relating to false identity documents,’ he said. ‘You have pleaded guilty to 18 counts - all of which were related to a campaign of cheating in casinos up and down the country over a period stretching back some six years.’ Lacatos hoaxed staff at the Rendezvous Casino in Southend-on-Sea, the Genting Palm Beach Casino in Mayfair and Maxim’s Casino also in London. He also fleeced customers at the Rank Casinos in Leicester, Stockport, Salford, Swansea, Portsmouth, Nottingham, Sunderland, Birmingham, Walsall and London premises in Victoria and Bayswater.","Unemployed poker player Mihai Lacatos cheated at casinos across country .

"James Corden pulled out all the stops for his opening night on US TV - breaking a showbiz exclusive, performing alongside a Hollywood legend and roping in some of his most famous celebrity friends. He made sure his first show went off with a bang with a opening sequence in which he joked he got the job by finding a golden ticket in a Willy Wonka-style chocolate bar. The sketch included appearances from Simon Cowell, Girls creator Lena Dunham, Billy Crystal, Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne and comedian Chris Rock ,all devastated or furious after opening chocolate bars without the golden ticket inside, before Corden found the winning ticket in the street. Scroll down for videos . Welcome to America: James Corden walks out for his first night as host of the US's Late, Late Show . The piece then showed how Jay Leno, Shia LaBeouf, and Arnold Schwarznegger whipped him into shape for his new role. Schwarzegger shouted at him 'You don't look like a talk show host, you look like two' while Leno waterboarded him for preparation. Meryl Streep then appeared to tell the London-born comic he was ready to a become a star. Corden added to the star power on display by bringing on his guests, Tom Hanks and Mila Kunis. Kunis delivered an exclusive for his inaugural show by reluctantly revealing that she and partner Ashton Kutcher 'might' have got married. Asked by Corden if she had tied the knot, she replied: 'I don't know, maybe.' Prompted by gestures from Hanks, the host inspected the huge ring on Kunis's hand and declared 'Oh, you got married! They got married, everyone! Oh my god, Mr and Mrs Kutcher!' Corden introduced himself to American audiences as he admitted he was stunned to be making a star-packed debut with his late-night talk show. Tinsel town: Aswell as a number of cameos from celebrities, Corden interviewed Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks . He was greeted by a whooping crowd including his wife, parents and celebrity friend Piers Morgan for his first outing as host of the Late Late Show on US network CBS. Corden is relatively unknown in America and he immediately addressed that fact as he opened the programme, which airs at 12.35am. 'I feel I should tell you a little bit about myself,' he said. 'My name is James Corden and I'm 36 years old and I'm from a place called High Wycombe in Great Britain, which you almost certainly will never have heard of because most people in Great Britain haven't heard of it so I don't expect you to.' He added: 'I'm married, sorry ladies, this ship has sailed.' Gesturing to his newly slimmed-down frame, he said: 'This don't stay on the shelf too long.' Addressing the cameras in front of a studio audience at CBS studios in Los Angeles, he added: 'We have two children - my son was four yesterday and my daughter is 16 weeks old - and I really couldn't be more honoured to be stood here talking to you now and, believe me, however shocked you are that I am standing here doing this job, you will never be as shocked as I am.' Unknown: He opened the show with a sequence joking that he got the job by finding a golden ticket . He added: 'I promise you we will have fun on this show and I promise we will do everything we can to put a smile on your face before or, let's be honest, more likely while you fall asleep at night. 'It really isn't lost on me what a privilege it is to be given a show like this and I really will do my best not to let any of you down.' The actor thanked his parents for flying over from the UK to watch his debut. He said: 'They have never been to Los Angeles before and they are already loving it, they are eating kale every day, my mum is getting a boob job next week. He choked on his words and wiped away a tear as he added: 'Thank you for being here, thank you for making the trip, I really appreciate it.' One of the show's biggest hits among fans . Other highlights of the show included Corden and Hanks performing a five-minute retrospective of Hanks' many films, complete with wigs and green screen backdrops. Corden took the unusual step of ending the show with a musical number before the end credits. Critics said the idea made the show stand out from other talk shows, though questioned whether the comedian would be able to sing the show out very week. Play it again: Critics praised Corden's idea of finishing with a musical number, for which he sat at a piano .","James Corden has received rave reviews for his first show on US TV .

"A takeaway owner has been banned from running any food businesses after inspectors found his restaurant was caked in grime with mouse droppings on the kitchen table. Council workers said Indian Ocean restaurant in Portsmouth had no hot running water, rotting food thrown into an outside yard, and pots kept on the floor next to rat poison. The sink in the fast food outlet was covered in limescale, the utensils were not clean, and inspectors heard from one customer who saw a mouse running into the kitchen. Disgusting: Mouse droppings are pictured on a shelf inside the Indian Ocean takeaway in Portsmouth, where a diner witnesses a live rodent running into the kitchen . Rotting: Food inspectors were called to the takeaway where they found no hot running water and food left to decompose in the yard outside (pictured) Stomach churning: The owner of Indian Ocean was banned from running a food business for life after inspectors said the grime-caked walls showed no cleaning had been done for some time . Shocking pictures from behind the kitchen doors reveal chefs' aprons covered with dried food, a light switch blackened with dirt, and a filthy phone used for taking orders in the kitchen. More pictures show the store room where some of the food was kept is cluttered and dirty, while there are mouse droppings on work surfaces and the floor. Paul Fairley, prosecuting, said: 'The accumulation of food, dirt and debris made it quite clear to the inspector that no cleaning at all had been done for some time. 'Clearly there was a very real risk of cross-contamination.' Punished: Matab Uddin, who appeared on behalf of the business in court, was fined £6,700 for multiple health and safety breaches (pictured, more rotting food and mouse droppings) Blackened: This phone was used by chefs to take delivery orders, and was also located in the kitchen . Messy: The store room where sacks of rice were left together with cleaning implements. Pans were also found being stored on the floor next to rat poison . Takeaway co-director Matab Uddin appeared in court on behalf of the business and pleaded guilty to six counts of breaching health and safety laws. Mr Uddin was fined more than £6,700 and given a hygiene prohibition order banning him from running any food business. Cllr Robert New, cabinet member for environment and community safety, said: 'We want people to be able to go out and eat a meal without fearing that their health will be harmed. Revolting: Chefs' whites covered with dried food are pictured hanging from a hook inside the grotty eatery . Grimy: Even the toilet inside the restaurant had not been property cleaned when inspectors paid their visit . The Indian Ocean takeaway has now been closed and the owner banned from running any food businesses . 'We work with restaurants to help them achieve high standards, but if they put customers at risk like this we will not hesitate to take court action..' Mr Uddin pleaded guilty to not maintaining premises in a clean condition, not maintaining premises in good repair and to having inadequate hand washing facilities. He also admitted failing to put in place, implement and maintain food safety procedures.","Indian Ocean inspected after customer saw mouse running into kitchen .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief of staff has come under fire yet again for her controversial decision to ban Labor appointments from retaining their positions on government boards. The move by Peta Credlin has been derided by the business community  as 'unrealistic' because nearly all of the directors on government boards were employed during Labor's six-years in government. Speaking at an Australian Institute of Company Directors lunch, chairman of CSIRO, Simon McKeon confirmed the ban on Labor appointees to government boards, claiming he will lose his position when his contract expires in June. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief of staff, Peta Credlin (pictured) has come under fire yet again for her controversial decision to ban Labor appointments from retaining their positions on government boards. 'Labor was in power for six years. Virtually everybody currently serving on the boards of government bodies was either appointed or reappointed while Labor was in power,' Mr McKeon said. 'If Abbott persists with his policy, there will be a full clean out of directorships.' 'The reality is that, yes, there is a rule that no one on the board of a federal government agency has been reappointed,' Mr McKeon said. 'It's an issue that many people are finding worrying.' Mr McKeon, who is also chairman of AMP, said the policy was at odds with what the AICD and Business Council of Australia subscribed to as good governance. 'My understanding is that there are many people like me who are disappointed with this quite brutal rule,' he said. 'I haven't come across anyone actually in government, let alone in private enterprise, who says `oh this is a wonderfully good initiative'.' Takeovers Panel member and Telstra director Dr Nora Scheinkestel said the panel's size had been significantly reduced as members had not been reappointed when their terms came up. In February, it was revealed that Peta Creddlin was at loggerheads with top Cabinet Ministers over her attempts to micro manage Julie Bishop and steal Joe Hockey's thunder . 'The reality is we lost a lot of people who brought great expertise, major institutional investors, investment bankers etc, and I think it's to the detriment of how the panel functions.' Mr McKeon said Australia needed excellent people on these challenging boards. 'The last thing we want to be doing is to one kick them off after three years, let alone send a very strong message saying this is the way it ought to be.' Dr Nora Scheinkestel, a director of Telstra, said she was strongly against the rule, as was chairman of BlueScope Steel Graham Kraehe. McKeon is a former Australian of the Year and is coming up for reappointment in following months, like many of his colleagues. Many of them are part of the boards for humanitarian or charitable reasons. 'My understanding is that there are many people like me who are disappointed with this quite brutal rule,' he said. But Abbott's devotion to Credlin is unmoving. The prime minister has defended her time and time again, calling her 'the fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with' In February, it was revealed that Peta Creddlin was at loggerheads with top Cabinet Ministers over her attempts to micro manage Julie Bishop and steal Joe Hockey's thunder. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is understood to have been involved in a feud with Credlin after her extensive attempt to micro manage the government included controlling minister's media appearances. Meanwhile, Treasurer Joe Hockey's grievances with Credlin are also understood to have stemmed from her tendency to over-step her mark and take control. At a small celebration following the release of the party's first budget, Credlin undermined the Treasurer by having the first word - leading the toast, and ultimately taking ownership of an accomplishment that should have been Hockey's to savour. But Abbott's devotion to Credlin is unmoving. The prime minister has defended her time and time again, calling her 'the fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with'. He is known to have told associates that raised complaints against her: 'you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Peta'. Meanwhile, Tony Abbott's future remains uncertain with some disgruntled MPs claiming it is only a matter of time before the leadership issue comes to a head.","Peta Credlin has banned Labor appointees from keeping their jobs .

"Hammer attack: Police have released this e-fit of a man who attacked a 26-year-old with a hammer . Police have issued an e-fit of a man they want to speak to after a pedestrian was hit repeatedly with a hammer by an attacker who jumped out of a bush. The 26-year-old man was left with severe injuries in the unprovoked attack in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex on March 24. The attacker was white, about 40 and over six foot tall with untidy brown hair. He was slim with hunched over shoulders and had very drawn cheeks. Police said he walked with a distinctive stagger. The victim was taken to hospital after the attack, though his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. Police initially believed the attack was part of an attempted theft. Detective Constable Nick O'Shaughnessy said: 'This appears to be totally unprovoked.

"Ed Miliband will 'pick your pocket on a frequent basis'  because he won't cut benefit spending, David Cameron claimed today. The Prime Minister said he 'made no apology' for claims that Labour would increase taxes on working families by more than £3,000 over the next five years – despite the Tory estimate being criticised by economists and dismissed as 'made up' by Labour. But Mr Cameron refused to say how he would deliver £12billion in savings from the welfare budget which he has claimed are needed to avoid tax rises. David Cameron this morning accused Labour of planning to 'pick you pocket' if they are elected in May . On the first full day of campaigning, the PM said Labour was planning to hike taxes on businesses on families to reduce the deficit instead of making savings from government spending. It came as Labour risked a new clash with business by pledging to reverse the Government's cut in corporation tax just weeks after it is due to come into effect. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the move would enable them to throw a lifeline to smaller firms - cutting business rates on 1.5 million small firms - rather than the big companies which benefit from the reduction in corporation tax. But the Conservatives warned that it could lead to the loss of almost 100,000 jobs, putting economic security at risk, 'for the sake of making a political point'. Mr Cameron meanwhile promised that the Conservatives would help business create another two million jobs over the course of the next parliament if they are returned to Downing Street. The PM said the election was 'a choice about whether you want a government that will find savings and not pick your pocket or with Labour a government that will pick your pocket, I think, on a pretty frequent basis.' The Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday challenged Mr Cameron's claim of a £3,000 tax hike under Labour, saying the party's plans did not suggest a rise of anything like that scale and that Conservative plans implied a larger overall package of spending cuts or tax rises. Ed Miliband has accused the Tories of using 'made up figures' Asked about the £3,000 figure, the Prime Minister told the BBC: 'I think it's a totally fair assumption. If Labour want to come forward now and change the assumptions and set out their own assumptions, then they can. 'But in the meantime, the best calculation available is the one that we have made.' Mr Cameron was repeatedly pressed over Tory plans to save £12 billion from the welfare budget, as part of an overall £30 billion cuts package. Asked whether he could rule out achieving some of the savings from cuts in disability benefits, he told the BBC that the coalition had just introduced a new Personal Independence Payment, adding: 'We haven't created that benefit in order to undermine it. We want to enhance it and safeguard it.' He added: 'Politics is about choices and my choice - and I think the British people's choice - is to find savings in welfare, rather than to put up people's taxes.' Meanwhile, Mr Balls announced that the first budget of a Labour government will cut business rates for 1.5 million small companies – worth an average of £400 – to be followed by a freeze the following year. Labour say that 17 small firms would benefit from the cut for every one large business helped by the reduction in corporation tax – first announced in Chancellor George Osborne's 2013 Budget – which takes effect next month. It argues the coalition spent £7 billion over the last parliament cutting the main rate of corporation tax to the benefit of larger firms while revenues from business rates rose by £3 billion, at an average cost to firms of £1,500-a-year. Mr Balls will say: 'Unleashing the potential of smaller businesses to grow, create more good jobs and raise living standards is a vital part of Labour's better plan. 'This is part of our plan to deliver a simpler and fairer tax system for small businesses. This is the right priority when money is tight. And it will mean that the tax burden on small businesses will be lower with Labour than under the Tories.' Nick Clegg this morning demanded the Tories come clean over how they will cut £12billion from the welfare budget . However the move risks re-opening the rift with some big business leaders who have strongly criticised Labour's spending plans. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke said that abandoning the cut in corporation tax would jeopardise economic security. He said: 'This would be the first time corporation tax has risen in over 40 years and Labour's plans could cost 96,400 jobs - it would put people's economic security at risk. 'The Conservative Party is helping businesses small and large as part of our long-term economic plan - we don't divide them up for the sake of making a political point.' Mr Cameron told Sky News's Sunrise that Labour's plan to raise corporation tax was 'a crazy thing to do when the economy is growing'. Asked for details of how the Tories' £12 billion benefit cuts would be delivered, Mr Cameron told ITV1's Good Morning Britain: 'Effectively what we are saying is that we need to save £1 out of every £100 that the Government spends in the next two years. We've done that in the last five years. We need to do it for two more. 'I think the right choice is to try to find that saving of £1 in every £100, rather than putting up people's taxes or adding to our borrowing. 'Where we've identified savings, we've been very clear about them. For instance, we've said that we'll cut the welfare cap - the amount of money that any family can get in welfare - from £26,000 to £23,000.' Mr Cameron said his party was setting out a 'very positive vision for Britain' with a pledge to help business create two million new jobs, adding: 'I can't think of anything more positive than that.'","Mr Cameron said he 'made no apology' for claims Labour would hike taxes .

"Your very own home to buy for less than $200,000, a short drive from Sydney's CBD - no, this is not a real estate fairytale. SQM Research guru Louis Christopher has poured over the current listings and singled out his top 10 in Sydney and Paul Bird from the Real Estate Institute of Victoria, has done the same for Melbourne buyers. If you think you've been priced out of the Sydney or Melbourne property markets, you're wrong, according to these real estate experts, who have found hidden gems among the over-inflated prices. 'The Sydney market is now 25 per cent above fair valuation but there is bargain buying,' Mr Christopher admitted. One of his top picks came in under $200,000 and where he found the others will surprise. Less than $200,000. The cheapest on the market and top pick, just 45 kilometres west of the CBD, a one-bed, one bathroom unit in St Marys is listed at $199,950 in the over-inflated Sydney property market . St Marys unit described as 'a low buy in price, all studios have been renovated to a high standard, close to train station and shopping centre with excellent growth prospects for the area' This St Marys apartment is going for less than half the median price for units in the western suburb of Sydney . There are listings in the eastern suburbs and inner west which make his top ten. And while there is no Toorak or Malvern in the Melbourne cheapies, they are still close to the Victorian capital and won't stretch the budget much beyond $300,000. Globally, Sydney is considered the third most expensive property market behind only Hong Kong and Vancouver, when it comes to housing versus household income - and Melbourne fares little better, ranking sixth. But there are ways around the rankings. 1 Werribee $240,000 . 2. Hoppers Crossing $299,999 . 3. Carrum Downs $329,000 . 4. Wyndham Vale $352,500 . 5. Hampton Park $360,000 . 6. Deer Park $363,500 . 7. Truganina $370,000 . 8. Pakenham $375,000 . 9. Frankston $375,000 . 10. Craigieburn $378,500 . 1. St Marys  $199,950 . 2. Waterloo $380,000 . 3. Cronulla $400,000 . 4. Wiley Park $419,000 . 5. Potts Point $429,000 . 6. Kingswood $440,000 . 7. Casula $470,000 . 8. Gladesville $485,000 . 9. Dharruk $490,000 . 10. Ingleburn $490,000 . The Potter Street apartment enjoys open plan kitchen equipped with premium appliances, flowing to private garden side balcony, a built-in robe and ducted air conditioning and access to a swimming pool, spa, sauna and gym . Room with a view in Waterloo. Just four kilometres south of the CBD, this studio apartment is considered a perfect entry point for the first home buyer and the astute investor - just $380,000 . 'Suburbs just like St Marys are increasingly in demand because of their affordability, the importance of the future second airport and infrastructure plans,' Louis Christopher said. The property on the Great Western Highway is going for just $199,950. 'Now this is a basic entry level but you must remember that St Marys has, on our numbers, risen 41 per cent in the past 3 years for units,' he added. 'And the median for units there is $391,000 - this is almost half that.' Werribee home for just $240,000, south-west of Melbourne. Comes in well below the median price for the area and is among the top pick for bargain buys in Victoria according to real estate experts . For your $240,000 you'll get a 'freshly painted home boasting three spacious bedrooms with large built in robes and main bathroom with separate shower and bath' Like St Marys, top of the Melbourne list is found a similar distance from the CBD, at Werribee south-west of the capital. For about $240,000, a 3 bedroom brick home can be all yours. 'Werribee, Hoppers Crossing and Carrum Downs are Melbourne’s most affordable suburbs,' said Paul Bird from the Real Estate Institute of Victoria. Also under the $300,000 mark is the three-bedder at Hoppers Crossing, also south-west of the city. The 46 Hampstead Drive home is on a 580 square metre property and boasts two bathrooms, split system reverse cycle unit and ceiling fans throughout, as well as floating flooring and a new pergola. 'Capital growth will still be at the top end of our forecast this year of between 8 to 12 per cent for Sydney,' Mr Christopher said. 'Right now no triggers are there on the horizon to stop it.' 'The Waterloo property is an interesting one. 'That's a unit in an area where the median is at $736,000, so to get it for $380,000 is an eye-opener. Potts Point apartment going for $429,000. Agents say it is 'reminiscent of a chic Parisian studio, the 33msq apartment is tucked away in a leafy cul-de-sac enclave in Potts Point’s fashionable Macleay Street quarter' It has black Japan floors, chandeliers• and is less than 2 kilometres to the CBD and offered for sale furnished . The one-bedder also comes with a 'common roof-top with harbour views' 'Potts Point has a median of $582,000 and is full of 1 bedders and studios and then you go to $1.17 million for two bedroom apartments.' He has found a small apartment on Crick Avenue for $429,000 and a property at Cronulla, not far from southern beaches for just $400,000. 'Buyers have to make sure, that even with these bargains, they need to do the work, inspections are recommended, you must check the quality always, yes it could be cheap but you need to know what you are getting for your money.' But he left, perhaps his best, for last. 'I like the one in Dharruk, a standard house, under $500,000 for what is basically 3 bedder on 600 square metres,' he said. 'It's not a mansion but look that's really affordable real estate, that means for your first home buyer they are keeping their mortgage low .

'Some people may turn their noses up now but in time that will change, especially with the plans for the second Sydney Airport.'

The number of Australian residential property listings was steady in the past month, Sydney reporting a jump in listings as more vendors placed their houses on the market, looking to make a sale after the summer beak, while some buyers backed away due to the high prices. 'The key point that Sydney right now is that it has less listings on the market than Perth does, it's crazy considering the population base of both.

'Over in Perth they cannot sell a thing, the market is falling away badly, the fly-in fly-out market is gone and that is causing a big rise in rental supply. 'I's different on the retail front because of the mining boom, retail rents went through the roof, they locked themselves in for five year leases and can't get it down, so prices stay high.' Nationally, the number of unsold properties reached 351,843 last month, a modest rise and 1.6 per cent up from a year earlier. 283 Ballarto Road at Carrum Downs, negotiations welcome at $329,000 for the 3-bedder .

Managing Director of SQM Research, Louis Christopher, said lower interest rates should continue to drive the Sydney market and lift buyer demand elsewhere . Low interest rates will help to underpin investor demand for property, helping vendors to sell their properties, which will keep a lid on listings in those cities, Mr Christopher said. SQM Research is an independent property research house which specialises in providing accurate property related research and data to financial institutions, property professional, real estate investors and the media. 'We are seeing a very different picture in Darwin and Perth. The softness in those markets is expected to be ongoing given that the commodity downturn is depressing economic activity in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

"A third of burglaries in England and Wales are committed by children, according to new statistics. Researchers found that of 291,567 burglaries where an offender was caught, 95,872 - or 32 per cent - were aged under 18. It was also revealed that of the total 1,068,901 burglaries committed between January 1 2008 and December 31 2013, less than a third resulted in a conviction. Alarming: A third of burglaries in England and Wales are committed by children, according to new statistics (file picture) The study was carried out by home security firm ADT, which submitted a Freedom of Information  request to 43 police forces in England and Wales. Spokesperson Gail Hunter said: 'We have found that some of the worst affected victims of burglary are children, yet these statistics have shown that the perpetrators of the crimes are children themselves. 'Our aim is to deter burglars and give householders peace of mind.' Of the 23 forces who responded to the FoI request, Nottinghamshire, Greater Manchester and the Metropolitan Police had the highest percentage of child burglars.

"The U.S. study showed supplements of of purified Omega 7 oil, the key fatty acid found in anchovies, could reduce harmful blood fats and boost 'good' cholestrol . Anchovies could hold the key to cutting risk factors for heart disease and stroke. An extract of omega oil found in them reduced levels of harmful blood fats and boosted ‘good’ cholesterol. The findings come from the first human trial of supplements of purified Omega 7 oil, the key fatty acid found in anchovies. After just a month volunteers were found to have a 44 per cent cut in C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation in the blood, along with triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol. Experts say the health benefits of palmitoleic acid, the prime Omega 7 acid, are only just emerging. Dr Michael Roizen, who led the US study, said ‘I think the major benefit come from decreasing inflammation as well as a beneficial effect on other contributing risk factors to cardiovascular disease, with no side effects that we know of.’ Dr Roizen, professor of medicine and head of the Wellness Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, said ‘The trial showed inflammatory markers were reduced and the effect on good fats was a bonus. ‘There seems to be a lot of benefit and not much risk – this could help us tackle some of the factors made worse by obesity that can lead to heart disease,’ he added. In the study, 60 adult volunteers were randomly assigned to take 220mg of palmitoleic acid once a day or an inactive supplement for 30 days. Those taking part had mildly raised levels of blood fats and inflammation. After the study tests showed a 44 per cent reduction in CRP, 15 per cent cut in triglycerides and eight per cent fall in LDL cholesterol – all factors linked to heart disease. Levels of HDL – a good form of cholesterol – rose five per cent compared with those taking dummy capsules. The trial, published by the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, was funded by Tersus Pharmaceuticals which provided the experimental capsules called Provinal. Provinal is available in the UK as Pura 7, a new brand of Omega 7 concentrated wild anchovy oil. Unlike the better known polyunsaturated fatty acids known as omega-3s, omega-7s are monounsaturated fats and they have different mechanisms of action. But to get the same effect from anchovies alone would mean eating a can of the fish a day . Palmitoleic acid was found by scientists at Harvard University in 2008 to be the first fatty acid to act as a hormone in the body. It plays an important role in regulating metabolism and appears to protect against harmful processes associated with obesity-related diseases such as diabetes. Dr Roizen, who chairs the scientific advisory board for Tersus Pharmaceuticals, said people would have to eat around a can of anchovies a day to get the same amount of omega 7 oil from a daily dose of supplements. ‘That’s a reasonable amount of anchovies every day if you like them, but some people find it simpler and more convenient to take supplements’ he added.

"More than 1,200 cases of scarlet fever have been reported since the start of 2015, with ‘steep increases’ across the country, say health officials . More than 1,200 cases of scarlet fever have been reported since the start of 2015, with ‘steep increases’ across the country, say health officials. Some 1,265 new cases have been recorded in England in the first six weeks of the year, with over 300 cases reported last week, according to data from Public Health England (PHE). Officials say the number is above typical levels for the high season of scarlet fever between March and April. Last year in England, over 14,000 cases of scarlet fever were recorded, the highest total since the late 1960s. Scarlet fever is a highly contagious bacterial illness that causes a distinctive pink-red rash which feels like sandpaper to touch. Dr Theresa Lamagni, PHE’s head of streptococcal infection surveillance said: 'As we enter into high season for scarlet fever, we ask GPs and other frontline medical staff to be mindful of the current high levels of scarlet fever activity when assessing patients. ‘Prompt notification of cases to local health protection teams is critical to enable local monitoring and rapid response to outbreaks. ‘Schools and nurseries should similarly be mindful of the current elevated levels of scarlet fever and promptly inform local health protection teams at an early stage if they become aware of cases, especially if more than one child is affected.’ The first symptoms of scarlet fever include a sore throat and fever which may be accompanied by a headache, nausea and vomiting. Between 12 to 48 hours after this, a characteristic fine, sandpapery rash develops, often appearing first on the chest or stomach. Cases are more common in children although adults of all ages can also develop scarlet fever. Individuals who think they or their child may have scarlet fever should consult their GP, said Dr Lamagni. Symptoms usually clear up after a week and in the majority of cases remain reasonably mild providing a course of antibiotics is completed to reduce the risk of complications. As scarlet fever is highly contagious, children or adults diagnosed with scarlet fever are advised to stay at home until at least 24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment to avoid passing on the infection. Symptoms include a sandpaper-like rash which can appear within 12 to 48 hours of catching the illness (file image)","More than 1,200 cases of scarlet fever reported since beginning of 2015 .

"For anyone packing for their holidays this year, getting their clothes to fit neatly inside their bags is always a struggle. But robotics engineers have now come up with what they say is the best way to fold a variety of clothes into neat little rectangles. Their findings, of course, are intended to help a new generation of robots take on some of our more monotonous household chores. The diagram above shows the approach outlined by the scientists for folding a jumper or long sleeved t-shirt . However, their work has also revealed the most effective ways of folding clothing so it can be stacked and packed away that may also help humans too. They use a principal that they have called the 'g-fold' - where clothing is laid out on a flat surface and gravity is used to help assist the folding of clothing. It could be the ultimate home help - able to find your dirty clothes, wash them, and even fold them before neatly putting them away. The robot developed by researchers at the University of California Berkeley is able to wash and fold clothes, recognise different items so they can be folded neatly away. Using Willow Garage's $280,000 Personal Robot 2, the researchers have been able to get their robot to take washing out oa basket, place them in a washer. The semi-humanoid robot is 'roughly the size of a person' and features two arms, claw-like 'gripper' hands, a front-facing screen head, and a tilting Hokuyo laser scanner that continuously flaps up and down like an ever-chattering mouth. For a jumper, for example, they suggest folding the sleeves in half first at the elbow and then folding them in at the shoulders. They then suggest folding the body of the jumper into the middle from both sides before then folding it in half. With a pair of trousers they suggest folding them along the crotch and then down the middle. The approach is published in a research paper describing how domestic robots can help around the home. Dr Pieter Abbeel, an associate professor in computer science at the University of California Berkeley, and his colleagues who have been conducting the research, said they attempted to solve the problem of folding clothing by treating it as a problem of geometry. They said: 'Spread crudley on a table, real-world clothing items do not perfectly resemble simple polygons. 'They contain curves rather than straight lines, corners which are rounded rather than sharp, and small intricacies which no two articles of a given class will necessarily share. 'Rather than reason explicitly about these complex shapes, we wish to transpose them as best we can into a shape which we know how to fold.' The researchers have now used their findings to help develop a robot that is able to sort and fold laundry. They developed software that allowed the Willow Garage Personal Robot to grip clothes with claw like gripper hands and lay it out on a flat surface. This is the technique the engineers recommended for folding up a standard t-shirt into a neat rectangle . Folding a pair of trousers or jeans requires just the simplest of folds shown above according to the research . The approach outlined above shows how the researchers recommend folding a variety of different clothing . The researchers have written software that enables a robot to fold clothing into neat rectangles (shown above) It is then able to assess them best way of folding the clothing based on its shape. Using cameras and shape recognition software, the robot is able to recognise where folds should be made and use its grippers to perform them. In a series of tests they found the robot was able to fold up to 40 different articles of clothing, including trousers, towels, sweaters and t-shirts. For a t-shirt, for example, they calculated it required just five folds, while a jumper requires seven folds. Folding a towel might seem simple but for a robot it requires the ability to use some complex geometry . Writing in a paper in a new journal on Household Robotic Services, the researchers said: 'The g-fold method worked reasonably well on pants. 'It was also able to fold a collared shirt quite neatly, despite that its rigid collar and buttons are not expressible in the language of our model.' They did warn, however, that the thickness of the cloth could interfere with the folding and in order to achieve truly neat folds it may be necessary to use an iron. Their approach contrasts with other suggest folding methods. Recently an approach known as the Japanese folding method, where a t-shirt is folded by gripping just two points on the cloth, has become popular. Others, such as researchers at the University of Oklahoma, have recommended packing bags using the bundle method. This, they claim, allows clothes to be bundled into a relatively small bag without while minimising the number of creases they have. Those of a more military background, however, often prefer an approach known as 'Ranger Rolling' where clothes are rolled up into tight little bundles. However Dr  Abbeel and his team said: 'While this study dealt explicitly with the task of laundry folding, we believe the tools put forth may generalize well beyond this to many deformable object manipulation challenges, such as ironing or bed-making. 'We hope that these results will provide another step forward on the long road toward the utopian future, where humans are never again nagged to ""do their chores.""'","Engineers at University of California Berkeley assessed folding techniques .

Meanwhile English raspberries have made their earliest ever appearance on supermarket shelves after a trial crop was grown during the sunniest winter since records began - despite snow continuing to blanket parts of the UK. Waitrose have announced they will stock the Chichester glasshouse-grown Diamond Jubilee berries from today, and say it is the first time consumers have been able to enjoy locally grown varieties in March. The early delivery of raspberries follows British-grown strawberries becoming available two weeks earlier than in previous years. This is thanks to the weather this winter which the Met Office has said was the sunniest since records began in 1929. While the figures for rainfall and temperature were average, the number of sunny days was 125 per cent of the long-term average. Laurence Olins, chairman of industry body British Summer Fruits, said the raspberries were the result of a trial plot of the 'very sweet' Diamond Jubilee berries planted by Harry Hall, who supplied Waitrose with the first strawberries of the season earlier this month. Just 200kg of the berries, which are grown in glasshouses, are expected this week but there should be around a tonne produced every week afterwards. Mr Olins said: 'This is probably the earliest we've seen English raspberries - around two weeks earlier than normal.' Waitrose's raspberry buyer Nicki Baggott said: 'This is the first time we've been able to offer British-grown raspberries so early in the year. 'It's incredibly unusual to have these ready in March, but a combination of growing techniques and the perfect weather have meant we can sell these juicy delights earlier than ever.' Raspberries were once regarded as a late summer crop, but British Summer Fruits said growers are using new varieties and innovative methods to extend the season.

It is a large berry, light in colour and firm with a good shelf life. Last year the crop was only available in small volumes with just 20 tonnes produced. It is the first time consumers have been able to enjoy locally grown varieties in March. Normally greenhouse-grown raspberries are not ready until at least mid-April. The Diamond Jubilee raspberry was created to commemorate the Queen's reign in 2012. Raspberries grown outside (not in a greenhouse) are expected to be on sale later than usual this year - in late May or early June, following the particularly cold but sunny winter.","While British Summer Time is just days away winter has had one last hurrah as snow fell across parts of the UK .

She said: ‘One of the fire extinguishers in the cockpit went off and it’s got halon gas, which is very dangerous, and as a result the pilot and first officer couldn’t breathe.' Ryanair described it as a minor fault involving a fire extinguisher and said the flight crew followed standard procedure by putting on their masks. Hannah added: ‘The oxygen masks deployed [for the flight crew] and we dropped down to a very low altitude. ‘When [the pilot] came over the tannoy to talk to us you could hear them breathing through the oxygen masks. Passengers said they were unaware of the reason for the emergency landing but knew it was serious . TV presenter and professional sailor Hannah White tweeted a photo of fire trucks on the tarmac . ‘The first thing we heard was “emergency landing”, said three times by the captain, which indicates a massive issue.’ Hannah said the announcement didn’t send immediate panic through the cabin as the passengers had no idea why flight FR8321 was diverting. She said: ‘It was clear that something was wrong. I would have to say the whole situation was dealt with amazingly and professionally.’ One of the flight attendants became anxious and oxygen masks did not deploy for passengers in the cabin, she added. Passengers hailed the crew for their professionalism while the plane diverted to Barcelona . Several passengers tweeted updates while the plane was on the ground and the pilots were checked over . Fire trucks greeted the Boeing 737 when it touched down shortly after 10:15am local time as passengers began to grasp the nature of the emergency. Hannah, 31, said: ‘We had very limited information until we were about to land. It was fairly calm on board, I have to say.’ Once people learned of the reason for the emergency landing they became agitated that they weren’t told sooner, she said. ‘It’s hot [on the plane], and people are pretty keen to get off or find out what’s going on.’ The flight crew declared an emergency over southern France and changed their flight path . Hannah, from London, and her coach were travelling to Valencia for a training session as she prepares to attempt to set a new world record for women’s speed sailing. After the plane had been on the ground for about 30 minutes, passenger Josh Adler tweeted: '@Ryanair it sounds like the faulty equipment has been replaced and you expect us to re-journey soon, thanks again to the pilots and crew.' A Ryanair spokeswoman said: 'This flight from London Stansted to Valencia diverted to Barcelona due to a minor fault with a cockpit fire extinguisher. 'The aircraft landed normally and was inspected by a Ryanair engineer, who replaced the fire extinguisher and cleared the aircraft to return to service. 'Customers remained on board and this flight has since departed to Valencia. Ryanair apologised sincerely to all customers affected by this diversion and short delay. 'Both pilots followed standard procedures and all crew continued to Valencia.'","Plane was flying from London Stansted Airport to Valencia, Spain .

The 18-year-old girl was waiting by the roadside in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when she was viciously attacked just before 11pm last Friday. Police have now confirmed the incident, which is being treated as attempted murder, was caught on camera and said the footage shows the 'very disturbing circumstances of the offence'. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage of the shocking bus stop attack in Leeds, West Yorkshire (pictured), shows the 18-year-old victim being hit over the head with a blunt object numerous times before being seriously sexually assaulted . Police said they are looking for an Asian man in his early 20s, of slim build, with receding dark coloured hair, in connection the attack which occurred as the 18-year-old victim waited at the bus stop on Friday evening . Officers from West Yorkshire Police said the footage is not being released to the public at this stage but said it may hold vital clues to help identify the suspect. Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'The offence has been captured on CCTV and while the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect as it stands, it clearly shows the very disturbing circumstances of the offence. 'The victim is seen being carried away a short distance while struggling against her attacker who takes her into a nearby garden. 'He can then be seen striking her over the head numerous times with a blunt object that we believe to have been a large stone.' The young Asian victim was grabbed from behind by the man, who is in his 20s and also believed to be Asian, in the Beeston Hill area of Leeds at about 10.52pm on Friday. She was assaulted over a considerable period of time which left her with serious head and hip injuries and she remains in hospital today. Police found her lying on the ground in a pool of blood with head wounds before later discovering she had been subjected to a serious sexual assault. Officers said the road was very busy at the time of the attack and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward. Mr Wallen said: 'The victim is still recovering in hospital after being subjected to a very violent physical assault and a repeated serious sexual assault. 'Her injuries are serious but thankfully not life-threatening and she has been left very badly traumatised by the ordeal. 'Specialist officers are working with her to support her and to elicit as much information as we can to assist with the investigation. 'At this point we believe the suspect is of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin. 'It is possible that the suspect could be somebody who is from abroad and has recently come to the country. 'They may be staying locally in a bedsit or hostel and I would like to hear from anyone who runs such premises who thinks they know who it might be.' Officers have combed the scene for any hair or fibres that could help them identify the suspect. Police said CCTV footage of the attempted murder incident shows the 'very disturbing circumstances of the offence' Police have described the suspect as Asian or Middle Eastern, aged in his early twenties, slim, with receding black hair. He was wearing dark clothing and possibly a light blue coat at the time of the attack. Mr Wallen said that shortly after the 'unprecedented' incident a man was seen running along nearby Beeston Road. He added: 'We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or who may have seen the suspect in the area at any time that evening. 'If you were the person seen running we would like you to come forward. 'We would also like to trace a potential witness - a woman who was seen standing at the bus stop before the incident before getting on either a number 1 or number 74 bus. 'This was a shocking incident which is unprecedented both for this area and for Leeds as whole. However I appreciate it will understandably cause people in the community a good deal of concern. 'Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team have been carrying out increased patrols in the area and those will be continuing as part of our efforts to provide visible reassurance to the community. The teenager was raped as she waited at a bus stop (pictured) near Leeds City centre late on Friday night. She remains in hospital three days on from the attack with serious but non life-threatening head injuries . 'They will also be working closely with key contacts in the community to keep people informed as the investigation progresses.' Detective Chief Inspector Elizabeth Belton said the crime had 'shocked the community' and said it was being treated as attempted murder because the victim had been 'left for dead'. The officer also confirmed the attack was not racially motivated and encouraged people to come forward with information about the attack, saying this is 'no time for family loyalty.' She added: 'I think it is possible that someone will know [the attacker] as there was a considerable amount of blood that was at the scene. 'It's possible that the person responsible will have had blood on their hands and possibly blood on their clothing.' Anyone with any information are asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.","Girl seriously injured after being raped and hit over head with 'large stone'

"Gone: Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minneapolis, apartment building last Wednesday after school . Dozens of relatives, friends and supporters came together Monday in Crystal, Minnesota, to plead for the safe return of a 10-year-old who vanished without a trace five days earlier. Barway Edwin Collins was last seen walking away from his apartment building in the 5400 block of Douglas Drive in Crystal after school Wednesday. Over the past five days, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies have been searching the area for Barway with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses. While police have not classified Barway's disappearance as an abduction at this point, on Monday they released a photo of two people who may be linked to the missing person case. According to the Crystal Police Department, the man and woman pictured in a screen shot from a CCTV camera installed at the front entrance of the Cedarwood apartment complex may have witnessed Barway being dropped off from school. So far, the mystery couple have not been named as suspects or even persons of interest in the case. Police Chief Stephanie Revering said during a press conference Monday that an Amber Alert has not been issued for Barway because investigators believe he may be with a relative. Witnesses: Police released Monday this screen shot from a CCTV video showing two people they believe may have witnessed Barway being dropped off from school .

Outpouring of support: A young boy adds a donation for Barway Collins' family to the pile during the vigil Monday . While law enforcement officials continued searching for the missing fourth-grader, members of Crystal's Liberian community were busy handing out fliers featuring Barway’s picture to help bring him home. At around 5pm Monday, more than 100 people gathered outside Cedarwood apartments for an emotional prayer vigil. Inside job? Police have not issued an Amber Alert saying the 10-year-old (center) may be with someone he knows . ‘We miss Barway,’ his father, Pierre Collins, told the crowd. ‘Barway has been gone for a very long time now. We are begging and asking everyone to look out there.’ Chief Revering also attended the gathering, promising Barway's family to continue looking for him until he is found, according to Minneapolis Star Tribune. Barway was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm. Mr Collins and his wife, Yamah, said the entrance surveillance camera caught their son opening the front door to the building, looking inside and then closing it, as if someone called him outside. ‘Please just bring him back. We just want Barway back. We don't want anything from them. Just let him go. Just let him come home,’ the parents begged, according to KARE11. Collins is described as 5 feet tall, weighing 80lbs with black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black jacket, white T-shirt, black pants, red shoes and carrying a red school backpack. Anyone with information on Barway Collins’ whereabouts is being asked to call police.","Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minneapolis, apartment building March 18 after school .

"The Boston Marathon bombing . trial jury on Thursday saw the remains of a pressure-cooker bomb . that prosecutors say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hurled at police during a . gunfight four days after the bombing. Jurors also got a chance to see jihadist files . recovered from his laptop. The bomb, described as similar to the twin bombs set off at . the race, was extracted from a Honda Civic in which it embedded . itself on a Watertown, Massachusetts street after Dzhokhar . Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, detonated it during . the gunfight. The pressure cooker was the same type as was used in the . bombs that killed three people and injured 264 on April 15, . 2013, said Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Brian . Corcoran, though the pieces found in Watertown were more intact . than those discovered at the race's finish line. The Boston bombing jury was shown images of a pressure cooker bomb that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly threw at police during a shootout in the neighborhood on Watertown . The pressure cooker bomb in Watertown was lodged into a Honda and was more intact than the two found at the Boston Marathon finish line . The lid of the device landed two houses away, in a local child's hockey goal . Pieces of the bomb shrapnel were found on nearby roofs, lawns, and lodged in the siding of homes up to a block away . A piece of shrapnel metal seen above with BBs stuck to it on the street where the Tsarnaev's threw pipe bombs and a pressure-cooker bomb, on the left. On the right, a remnant of the bottom of the Watertown pressure-cooker bomb . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if he is convicted of charges that include carrying out the bombing and shooting dead a university police officer three days later as he and Tamerlan, 26, tried to flee Boston . 'Those pieces were typically more fragmented, more cut up,' Corcoran testified in U.S. District Court in Boston, looking at . both the main pot and its lid, which was found halfway down the . block from the blast site, in a child-sized soccer goal in a . home's side yard. 'This was a better representation of the . pressure cooker as a whole.' Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if he is . convicted of charges that include carrying out the bombing and . shooting dead a university police officer three days later as he . and Tamerlan, 26, tried to flee Boston. The Watertown gunfight in the early hours of April 19, 2013 . ended when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hopped into a black Mercedes and . attempted to run over three police officers who were trying to . arrest Tamerlan. The officers jumped out of the way but Dzhokhar . ran over his brother, who was briefly caught up in the vehicle's . wheels and dragged. Tsarnaev's lawyers opened the trial early this month by . bluntly admitting he carried out the bombing and shooting. Their . goal is to convince the jury that the plot was driven by . Tamerlan, with Dzhokhar a junior partner in the scheme. Proving . that could persuade the jury to sentence the younger brother to . life in prison without possibility of parole, rather than death. Tsarnaev (left) pictured in court on Thursday as an expert testifies about the jihadi propaganda found on his laptop . Tsarnaev casually leans on his hand during his death penalty trial on Thursday, March 19 . The jury was also shown images of a Samsung laptop, which was found in Watertown along with Tamerlan's high school diploma . Several jihadist materials were found on Dzhokhar's laptop and orange flash drive, including an article on how to make homemade bombs . Another FBI agent testified that investigators recovered . several apparently jihadist documents on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's . laptop, including at least three copies of Al Qaeda's 'Inspire' magazine, one featuring a cover story headlined 'Make a Bomb in . the Kitchen of Your Mom,' and another brochure-type document . titled 'Jihad and the Effects of Intention Upon It.' The bombing killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, . graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard. Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean . Collier, 27, was shot dead three days later. Separately on Thursday, Middlesex County District Attorney . Marian Ryan said her office would pursue murder charges against . Tsarnaev for the shooting of Collier, following his current . trial on bombing charges. The above photo shows the apartment of Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, Dzhokhar's friends.

Donohue, was wounded after Tamerlan Tsarnaev had run out of . bullets in the one working firearm the brothers had. 'The written investigatory report concerning the Laurel . Street incident is anticipated to be completed within two . months,' Ryan said in a statement. A spokeswoman said the report . would include 'ballistic information' but declined to confirm . whether it would address how Donohue was wounded.

"Rare photos have emerged of the primitive and isolated compound Osama Bin Laden lived in until a Western bombing campaign forced him to flee. The images resurfaced last month during the terrorism conspiracy trial in New York of Al Qaeda lieutenant Khaled al-Fawwaz, a communications conduit for the terrorist organisation in London in the mid-1990s. They were taken by Palestinian journalist Abdel Barri Atwan, who was invited to the hideout in 1996 as part of Bin Laden's ploy to spread his message of hate to the Western world. The 9/11 mastermind had declared war on America and planned a media campaign to garner international attention. Scroll down for video . Image: Osama Bin Laden holds a Kalashnikov rifle in Tora Bora, a mountainous region of Afghanistan, in November 1996. The Al Qaeda leader spent years developing a network of tunnels and caves in the area . On message: The terrorist mastermind had, by this point, declared war on the United States and tried to use international press coverage to spread the word . Perception: The militant would sit in front of Islamic books when recording his video messages to make it seem like he was intellectual . Entourage: A smiling Bin Laden is seen walking around Tora Bora surrounded by bodyguards, loyal followers and family members . Lair: The rare images of Bin Laden in his home setting were released as part of the trial of Al Qaeda lieutenant Khaled al-Fawwaz, a communications conduit for Al Qaeda in London in the mid-1990s . Companion: He sits alongside Syrian-born ideologue Abu Musab al-Suri, a Bin Laden ally who once ran training camps inside Afghanistan . It included his first television interview for CNN's Peter Arnett and Peter Bergen in 1997 and a sit-down for ABC News' John Miller a year later. 'He wanted media exposure,' Atwan told CNN's Bergen for his 2006 book, The Osama Bin Laden I Know. 'He wants to say, ""Now I am an international figure; I'm not just a Saudi. I am aggrieved at Americans who are occupying Saudi Arabia who are desecrating the Holy Land""', said Atwan. He was seen making video announcements in front of shelves of Islamic books - in a bid to make him look intelligent - and was captured with a wide grin as he strolled around the isolated compound. For several years, he developed an intricate network of caves and dwellings 14,000ft up in the White Mountains. He discovered the area during the anti-Soviet war in the 1980s, and decided to settle and set up the compound  in 1996 - when the Taliban had taken control of Afghanistan. Bin Laden chose the location because of its proximity to the border with Pakistan, while the rugged terrain meant it would be difficult for opposition forces to attack on foot. The system of caves and underground passages meant he would also be protected from air attacks. He told Atwan during the interview: 'I feel really secure in the mountains.' According to reports Bin Laden would spend hours on long hikes through the mountains, always carrying a Russian-made Kalashnikov rifle by his side. Bodyguards, militants and children - including his sons - would constantly follow him around as he looked for new hideout locations. He told his family members they needed to know the terrain and the tunnel system inside out in case of an attack. Reporter: The rare pictures were yielded by Palestinian journalist Abdel Barri Atwan (right)  during an interview in 1996. Bin Laden wanted the media coverage to project his status as an international terrorist leader . Force: Dozens of fighters would accompany him on the long walks. They would stay in the compound alongside Bin Laden's multiple wives and children . Primitive: One of Bin Laden;s hideaways was made mud and stone and propped up by wooden struts . Escape: Pictured is a secret passageway - part of the intricate network that lay in the mountainside. Bin Laden told his sons they had to know well the tunnel network in case the area came under attack . Home: A two-bedroom house - made out of mud and stone - where Bin Laden lived in Tora Bora . Sparse: A child's tricycle is seen outside one of the many isolated homes designed for the terrorist leader. His children were fed a limited diet of rice, bread, eggs and salty cheese . Keeping guard: A boy stands outside one of the primitive houses holding a Kalashnikov. Most people living in the compound would always walk around with a rifle . Gallop: The militant is seen riding on a horse below his compound. He escaped Tora Bora on horseback when Western forces were getting closer to his hideout in 2001 . The compound, nestled in the snow-covered mountains, was primitive and only connected to the nearest city of Jalalabad by dirt road. During the visit Atwan took a picture of a two-bedroom house made of mud and stone Bin Laden is believed to have shared with his wives and family. His children were believed to have suffered from constant hunger, with a limited diet of eggs, rice and salty cheese. The terrorist leader remained in the area until 2001. Western forces had tracked him down to the region and consistently targeted it with air strikes. During an assault in December, just months after the devastating September 11, attacks he evaded capture by escaping on horseback and slipping into neighboring Pakistan or northern Afghanistan. He was helped by local warlord, Maulvi Yunus Khalis, who had fought with Bin Laden against the Red Army during the 1980s, according to officials including Michael Scheuer, former CIA pointman in the hunt for the al-Qaida chief. In that month, Tora Bora endured one of the most punitive bombing campaigns in history. In just three days, from December 4 to 7, bombers dropped some 700,000lb of explosives on Bin Laden's positions - the equivalent of two nights' worth of RAF raids over Berlin during World War II. Experts have asserted that Bin Laden was able to escape because of a lack of American willingness to commit more troops to the operation — at a time when the head of Al Qaeda was well within grasp. After Bin Laden relocated, the hunt expanded in the Kunar border zone. In 2003, US soldiers attacked the hideouts of Bin Laden's military chief Kashmir Khan, slightly wounding him. In 2005, a US special forces Chinook helicopter was shot down in Kunar, killing all 16 personnel on board. The 10-year search for him ended on May 2 2011 when he was killed during a Navy Seal operation in Abbottobad. Smile: Bin Laden grins during one of his lengthy walks in the isolated area . Break: Bin Laden speaks to al-Suri during a two-hour hike across the mountains. Journalist Atwan said: 'He loved the nature there. He loved the mountain. They were trying to have their own community' Isolated: The 9/11 mastermind would also hike alone in the snow-covered mountains alone for hours. As Western forces closed in on the network of compounds in 2001, Bin Laden escaped . Hideout: From left, inside a cave, are al-Suri, bin Laden and British documentary maker Gwynne Roberts . Stroll: The terrorist leader uses a walking stick as he walks with two militants. He settled in the Afghan city of Jalalabad in 1996 - the Tora Bora hideaway was hidden up a long dirt track . Isolated: A sparse valley in the mountainous Tora Bora region. Bin Laden discovered the area during the anti-Soviet war in the 1980s and moved there in 1996 . Security: The journey from Jalalabad to Tora Bora along the dustry track was a perilous and bumpy ride past armed checkpoints . Landscape: A view of the lake outside Tora Bora. A limited number of lights can be seen within the huts at dusk . Ideologue: Al-Suri, seen here taking photos, published online 'The Call for Global Islamic Resistance'  in 2004, saying there need not be any organizational bonds between 'resistance fighters' Desire: Al-Suri advocated a 'leaderless jihad' with 'spontaneous operations' performed by unconnected individuals and cells all over the world . Changing allegiance: Al-Suri relaxes  in one of the hideouts. He was a supporter of Bin Laden during the 1990s but soon would condemn Al Qaeda's hierarchical and bureaucratic structure .","Images taken by  journalist Abdel Barri Atwan in 1996 released in trial of Al Qaeda lieutenant Khaled al-Fawwaz .

"It's normally women accused of high maintenance beauty routines and spending hours to get ready. But are men starting to taking over as the main bathroom hogs? In a new interview, Peter Andre has revealed that although he takes just 15 minutes to get ready each morning, that's only after he's spent an hour or more indulging in a pampering regime. 'If I have to be somewhere in the morning, the actual getting ready takes 15 minutes,' Peter told The Guardian. Scroll down for video . Role reversal? Peter Andre has revealed that his daily grooming and fashion routine sees him prepping for over an hour before he can leave the house . 'But I need an hour before that to put on my steam shower, go downstairs and sit and have a coffee in silence.' Peter's far from ready to walk out of the door after his morning beverage ritual however, which consists of a double espresso and glass of water, for both a caffeine and hydration boost. Next, comes jumping in the steam shower he has preheated, before tackling his hair and skin. He said: 'My hair is curly, so if I'm, going somewhere on my own, not a work event, I will run the straighteners over it. I also use coconut oil as a moisturiser. 'You can do anything with it - eat it, cook with it, use it on your skin. It's fantastic.' Who hogs the bathroom in this house? Part of Peter's morning routine involves preheating his steam shower for an hour while he drinks a cup of coffee in silence. So when does fiancée Emily MacDonagh (right) get her turn? Then, comes the agonising decision of what he's going to wear each day. Picking an outfit the night before just isn't an option for the popstar. Instead, Peter needs to walk into his wardrobe and pick out clothes which match his mood for the day. 'I could pick out a million things the night before, but if I wake up and I don't feel as good as I did the day before, I won't want to wear any of it.' In contrast, British model and It girl Alexa Chung has said she can be up and out of the house in a mere seven minutes. British fashion icon Alexa Chung may give everyone style envy on the front row, but the model claims her daily 'getting ready' routine takes her a mere seven minutes. Pictured: Alexa Chung attends the Prada show during the Milan Fashion Week last month . Talking to STAR magazine,the front row regular said, 'In real life, it's around the seven-minute mark. But for fashion week, I try and put in a bit more of an effort.' For Alexa Chung however, more of an effort means just three minutes added to her normal routine. Compared with Peter's painstaking grooming process, Alexa's final Fashion Week regime takes her a maximum of 10 minutes. Fashion Week ready in 10 minutes or less? It girl Alexa claims that to get ready for big events like sitting front row at Fashion Week, she needs just an extra three minutes of preening time.

"Police are searching for a Massachusetts mother who is thought to have kidnapped her five children, preventing authorities from treating her 2-month old daughter in need of medical care. Yurong Wu, 41, of Quincy, is wanted for parental kidnapping and child endangerment, and is believed to have fled to New York City before losing custody of her children to the state last week. She is believed to have taken her children Yu Fan Mei, 10, Kelly Mei, 8, Kethy Mei, 6, Kate Mei, 2, and Kalen Mei, two months. Scroll down for video . Yurong Wu, (left) 41, and Jackie Mei, (right) 50,  face charges of child endangerment after Wu disappeared with her five children. Police believe the mother, who also faces kidnapping charges, took them to New York City . Department of Children and Families officials was given custody of the children last Wednesday after they could not find them at their home managed by the Quincy Housing Authority. The youngest child is believed to have serious health issues and was in 'dire need' of treatment, police told CBS Boston. The children's father Jackie Mei, 50, was arrested Friday and charged with child endangerment and misleading a investigation after allegedly being uncooperative with police. He posted $1,500 bail and was released with a GPS device. Court documents show the father saying that his wife turned off her phone and told him that she would take care of the children. His lawyer says he does not speak English and does not know about the whereabouts of his wife or children. Wu and Mei's children Yu Fan (left, 10), Kelly (center, 8) and Kethy (right, 6) were taken along with their younger siblings Kate, 2, and Kalen, two months (not pictured) Department of Children and Families officials gained custody of the children after they could not find them at Wu and Mei's Quincy home (pictured) Police in Massachusetts are working with New York City authorities to find the family. The family has relatives in the metropolis and NYPD visited a house in Brooklyn on Monday night but did not find the children, Quincy Police spokesman Capt John Dougan told Daily Mail Online. It is not believed Ms Wu wants to harm her children, and neighbors say she was concerned about losing custody of them this winter, according to the Patriot Ledger. The mother and her children, who have no car, may have left weeks ago, a neighbor told NECN. Stephen Hensley said that he saw the woman and child get in a van and leave around the time of  'the first snowstorm' and he had not seen them afterwards. Capt Dougan said that the police currently believe that Wu left with her children shortly before Department of Children and Families officials came to her home. He said the investigation is still focusing on New York City and that he is 'confident' that Wu and her children have not left the country.

"Next time someone asks you how wide the Milky Way is, you might want to rethink your answer of '100,000 light-years'. Astronomers have discovered that a strange ring of distant stars may actually be part of our galaxy, making it 50 per cent bigger at 150,000 light-years wide. This is based on re-analysis of a distant ring that surrounds our galaxy, which the astronomers think is now actually part of the Milky Way. Astronomers in New York have revised the size estimate for our galaxy (shown). They now say it is 50 per cent bigger in size at 150,000 light-years wide, not 100,000 light-years. This is based on re-examining a ring of stars in the so-called Monoceros Ring . The team of scientists from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York studied the Monoceros Ring, which is a long ring-like filament of stars that ‘wraps’ around our galaxy three times. It is located 65,000 light-years from our galaxy’s centre, and in total is 200,000 light-years in length. Previously it was thought to be a stream of stars torn from the nearby Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy due to interactions with the Milky Way. The Milky Way is thought contain more than 200 billion stars. This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars. On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars. Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created. Astronomers believe the Milky Way wasn’t always a stunning barred spiral. It formed into its current size by ‘eating’ other galaxies. Now, however, it seems that the ring may actually be part of our own galaxy, and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies. ‘It looks to me like maybe these patterns are following the spiral structure of the Milky Way, so they may be related,’ Dr Heidi Newberg, from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, told Discovery News. ‘It now looks to me like it’s part of the disk,’ she added. The latest discovery was made using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a projecting to map parts of the universe in three dimensions. The results will be published in the Astrophysical Journal. Another ring, known as the TriAnd Ring, may also be part of the Milky Way, further increasing its size. To verify their theory, astronomers will use data from Europe’s Gaia telescope, which is also mapping stars in the Milky Way. Previously the Monoceros Ring was thought to be a stream of stars torn from the nearby Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy due to interactions with the Milky Way (illustration shown). Now, however, it seems that the ring may actually be part of our own galaxy, and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies .","Astronomers in New York have revised the size estimate for our galaxy .

"An 18th century folly which was converted into a luxury home and featured on TV property show Grand Designs is on sale for £2 million. Kemeys Folly, in Langstone, near Newport in South Wales, starred in the popular Channel 4 programme six years ago when it was converted into a six-bedroom luxury house - and now owners Sarah and Dean Berry have put the unusual property up for sale. The ambitious project saw the couple combine the painstaking restoration of a castellated 18th Century hunting lodge with the construction of a state of-the-art glass extension. Scroll down for video . Kemeys Folly (pictured) starred in popular property show Grand Designs six years ago. Its owners have now put the unusual home up for sale . Owners Sarah and Dean Berry have now put the unusual Grade II listed six-bedroom home up for sale for £1,999,950 . The ambitious project saw the couple combine the painstaking restoration of the old hunting lodge with a state of-the-art glass extension . The couple paid £830,000 for the tower in 2005, which was being sold by a couple who had quickly realised that there was far too much work to do, and put it back on the market. Work on Kemeys started in January 2007 and over the next year an old extension was demolished, the outside of the tower was re-pointed and the inside was stripped as much as the building's listed status would allow. Now, The Grade II listed home boasts six bedrooms, five of which have en-suite bathrooms - and including a master bedroom which takes up a whole floor of the tower and opens up on to its own roof terrace. Sitting in 23 acres of land the property also boasts a cinema room in the older part of the building and outside there is a large pool house with swimming pool and changing facilities. The folly also has four stables which back directly onto a paddock. The glass extension takes full advantage of the stunning hilltop location - on a clear day you can see 11 counties as well as the two Severn road bridges and the Bristol Channel. The owners say the surrounding woodland is perfect for long walks, and which features lots of wildlife, including deer. Something of a local landmark, the original building was a hunting lodge dating back to the 1700s and was at one point owned by the Sheriff of Monmouth. The folly is situated in the heart of the Usk Valley in South Wales and has a roof terrace which enjoys this view over the  countryside . The house boasts a master bedroom and en suite which takes up a whole floor of the tower and opens up on to its own roof terrace . It was struck by lightning in 1890, rebuilt as a home in the early 1900s and was eventually converted into a house for the Sheriff of Monmouth . The couple paid £830,000 for the folly in 2005 and spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renovating it and bringing it up to scratch . Mrs Berry said: 'We bought it with a view to carrying out significant work on it, renovating the tower and extending it. 'It was one of those love at first sight moments. We were in London at the time but knew we wanted to move back here to where we grew up. 'Neither of us even knew it existed but when we saw it we wanted it. It was just outstanding.' The couple spent a huge amount of time with planners to agree on a concept for the home that everyone was happy with. She said: 'The idea was to keep the original features of the main building, such as the beautiful exposed stonework, but not to mimic what was already there in the extension. 'We wanted to create new sections that helped to tell the story of the building through the years and were an expression of the 21st century. 'Living here has been such fun.' A former hunting lodge, the folly was built in 1712 by local landowner George Kemeys. It was struck by lightning in the late 1890s, partially rebuilt as a home in the early 1900s and converted into a house for TE Watson, the High Sheriff of Monmouthshire. The couple are selling as they are downsizing but say: 'Whoever takes Kemeys Folly on now is going to enjoy such an amazing life here.' The house is for sale for £1,999,950 with Chewton Rose.

"Diary: The new guidance from NICE suggests keeping a diary of everything you eat to help keep those extra pounds off . They are pastimes that millions of us do every week to keep relatively fit and healthy. Dancing, gardening and walking up hills are all well-known as simple exercises that would help to fight the flab. But the health watchdog NICE believes we should be given official guidance to remind those who don’t bother - and that we should keep a daily diary alongside details of meals, snacks and drinks. The watchdog warns to pay particular attention to lattes, high protein drinks, nuts and alcohol which contain hidden calories they may not realise they have consumed. It is estimated that a quarter of adults in the UK are obese although this is projected to increase to almost two thirds by 2050. The condition is thought to cost the health service and economy £16 billion a year through medical treatment, sick days and benefits. Officials from NICE hope that encouraging adults to ‘self-monitor’ their activity and food intake will prompt them to adopt healthier lifestyles. They are particularly concerned that the emergence of a ‘coffee culture’ in recent years has led to Britons consuming calorie-laden lattes and muffins on top of their meals and snacks. Guidance also points out that many adults who do exercise underdo the good work immediately afterwards by ‘refuelling’ on high sugar sports drinks and protein shakes. Additionally, the watchdog instructs parents to avoid giving children sweets at weekends, the school holidays or even for good behaviour. Even in small amounts, they can ‘disrupt’ everyday healthy eating habits and lead to obesity, they state. Scroll down for video . They also encourage parents to ensure children get at least nine to ten hours sleep a night as staying up late is linked to being overweight. Other recommendations include urging adults not to drink too much alcohol as this also contains high numbers of hidden calories. It points out that even if a woman sticks within the recommended safe limits of 2 to 3 units a day – a large glass of wine – this contains as many calories as Mars bar. Don't undo good work at the gym by drinking protein shakes or high sugar sports drinks afterwards. Avoid calorific coffees like lattes – and the muffins and cakes that come with them. Remember nuts and alcohol have 'hidden calories'. Don't allow children more than two hours of 'screen time' a day – which includes watching TV or playing handheld video games. Have 'TV-free' days and go on a walk or cycle-ride instead. Source: NICE guidance . Professor Gillian Leng, Deputy Chief Executive at NICE, said: ‘Overweight and obesity is an enormous concern for the health service in England, it has a huge personal health cost to the individual and the financial impact of dealing with obesity and its associated conditions and its associated conditions is creating a significant burden on the NHS. ‘A significant amount of effort is needed to lose weight and keep it off. This guidance sets out the many things individuals can do to maintain a healthy weight that are known to be effective. Professor Susan Jebb, an expert in diet and population health at the University of Oxford, said: ‘In 21st century Britain most people are less active than recommended for good health and it is all too easy to eat more calories than we need – weight gain is unfortunately all too common. ‘The recommendations emphasise the value of reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods and the amount of time spent sitting down and inactive.’ The guidance also states that ideally, children should have no more than two hours screen time a day – which includes watching TV or playing handheld video games. Parents are also encouraged to have TV-free days either weekly or monthly and spend the time going for a walk or cycle ride. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘Finally NICE is getting the message, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind. ‘Children, and maybe their parents too, will rebel against the advice that sweets should never be offered as treats on any day of the year - but both will welcome the advice long-term.’ Move more: It also suggests people try and get more active to keep their weight within healthy levels . Only yesterday the head of the NHS Simon Stevens launched an initiative that will very overweight patients referred for cookery classes and Zumba keep fit sessions. Sessions paid for by the health service will teach adults to boil, grill and steam food rather than dunking them in the frying pan. They will also receive vouchers to attend exercise sessions at local community centres or gyms.","Health watchdog NICE advises keeping a diary of every morsel consumed .

"A stockbroker who crashed a £250,000 super-car was pulled from the burning wreckage by the salesman giving him a test drive. The driver, who has not been named, lost control of the McLaren 650S and smashed it into a tree. As the vehicle burst into flames, salesman Lee Christian managed to clamber out but he was initially unable to free the unconscious driver. One of the firefighters saidit had been the single biggest accident he had attended where the crew did not have to remove bodies . It was only seconds before the fuel tank exploded – completely destroying the 200mph car – that he pulled him clear. The stockbroker was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he was treated for fractures to a shoulder, elbow and ankle. He is still recovering from a series of skin grafts. Mr Christian, who suffered cuts and burns, was back at work at the McLaren dealership in Knutsford, Cheshire, within four weeks. Father-of-two Lee Christian, 37, sustained a nasty cut to the back of his head and burns to his face and head . The father of two said: ‘After we impacted with the tree, my first thought was that I was OK. But when I looked across, the driver looked in a very bad way. 'The impact had ripped off the driver’s door and there were flames in the back of the car. ‘I tried to make my escape through the passenger door but that was jammed, so I had to clamber over the driver. ‘The fire was so intense that it was difficult to get to him and on the third attempt I knew it was going to be now or never. ‘I managed to grab him by his trouser belt and by an arm and with my feet against the vehicle managed to pull him out. ‘I then managed to carry him 30 metres into the field with the car behind me banging and exploding. 'Passers-by used the detached driver’s door to shield him from the intensity of the blaze.’ Mr Christian has been honoured with a bravery award from Cheshire Constabulary. Chief Constable Simon Byrne said: ‘It was a selfless act in an extremely perilous scenario that put Lee’s own life at risk. His actions are very much deserving of this commendation.’ The incident took place on a country road near High Legh, around four miles from the McLaren dealership. Mr Christian said he had had two ‘very nice’ letters from the driver’s wife in which she said without his actions her husband would not be alive. A firefighters said it had been the single biggest accident he had attended where the crew did not have to remove bodies . In the weeks following the crash Mr Christian also went to thank the firefighters from Stockton Heath who had attended on the day . He added: ‘One of the firefighters told me it had been the single biggest accident he had attended where the crew did not have to remove bodies. ‘That just shows how lucky we both were on that day.’ Last year, a McLaren worker died in hospital after he crashed a 650S on his way back to the Formula 1 team’s headquarters in Woking, Surrey.","Salesman Lee Christian from Cheshire saved his customer from the crash .

"This is the moment a group of weaver hungry ants entered into a tug of war after they captured a fly and desperately fought to have it for their dinner.

"Having concentrated on her career up until her mid 30s, Claire Patterson had still not met Mr Right and was conscious that her biological clock was ticking. With a professional career under her belt and financially stable, the photographer decided she wanted a baby of her own - and decided to adopt. After sailing through the process, she was shown a video of a little boy who melted her heart. ‘He was sitting down and then suddenly he smiled and that was it,’ Claire said. Claire Patterson was delighted when she was told she could adopt a baby boy . ‘I didn’t want any child with a disability as I was a single adopter and I couldn’t facilitate that. ‘It said in his child performance report that he was a healthy, babbling baby boy and I was thrilled when I was told I could collect him. ‘It was such a special day and he was going to be my very special boy, I was very excited.’ Claire knew that her child had some mild developmental delay but said she felt optimistic. ‘I thought he couldn’t crawl because he had been in care and thought with a bit of determination and one-to-one care from me, it was only a matter of time.’ Having only seen the video and some photographs, Claire, who is now 40, started to worry when she met him and took him home two weeks later: '‘I was concerned about the shape of his head. It seemed to be very flat at the back, but even then, I didn’t know what was to come,’. She said looking back, alarm bells should have rung sooner that there was something seriously wrong with her son. ‘He didn’t do anything you would expect a child of his age to do,’ she said. ‘He couldn’t roll over, he couldn’t talk or crawl and had very poor muscle tone.’ The look of love: Claire plays with the little boy she handed back to social services after the tot started suffering as many as 36 seizures a day . She took him to speech therapy and would encourage him constantly, but said he never missed her if she went out of the room and didn’t speak at all, other than one word, ‘mummy’. Having adopted him in 2011, Claire had persevered and the little boy learnt to walk. However, having been to visit her parents in the Lake District in October 2012, Claire’s world began to disintegrate. ‘I’d just pulled into a petrol station in Preston when I turned around and he was in the back of the car and started to jolt - he was having a seizure. It was one of the most terrifying moments of my life.’ Claire took many photographs of the little boy in the two years he spent with her, including this one . Unfortunately, it was the first of many seizures which eventually resulted in him going to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. ‘He had neurological damage, or brain damage, and had been born that way,’ Claire said. ‘He was having 36 seizures a day and his epilepsy was a symptom of something much bigger. He didn’t know who I was. ‘At one point we were sleeping downstairs with a bag packed, always ready for the ambulance. His seizures were out of control. ‘He had breathing difficulties and once was in a coma. At one point it was thought he might even die. ‘It was very, very stressful and I had reached the end of my physical and mental strength.’ Claire said she felt she had no option but to call social workers who she said agreed with medics that he could no longer be cared for at home. ‘It was a heartbreaking decision, I loved him,’ she said. ‘It’s certainly not something I took lightly at all, but I had nothing more to give and had to hand him back.’ However, Claire said that although social workers had agreed she couldn’t care for him, a legal ‘care order’ is needed to hand a child back which she says implies the parents are at fault as they cannot look after it. Claire said she was so incensed, she went to court to win a ‘no fault’ ruling, thus ensuring there would be no negative reflection on her, crucial if she wanted to adopt again. ‘I had to give him back through no fault of my own, and I wanted a record of that,’ she says. Claire Patterson is hoping her website will provide support to anyone else going through adoption disruption. Picture posed by models . Now Claire has launched a website called Adoption Disruption UK to provide support for others for whom adoption breaks down. ‘Sometimes it just doesn’t work out and parents have no choice but to return their children, whether they are babies or teenagers,’  Claire said. ‘More needs to be done around care orders as it’s not always the fault of parents that they have to hand their children back.’ Claire said that the little boy is now living in a home environment where he is cared for by four people around-the-clock. Currently embarking on a new adoption journey, Claire hopes to be approved to adopt another child in six months’ time. ‘I’m hoping to have a child between three and six years old,’ she said. ‘I’m very hopeful for the future and through my website, I hope I can help support someone who might be feeling as isolated as I did,’ she added.","Thrilled to become mother to little 18-month-old boy .

"Jurors on Thursday were shown a to-do list written by former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez shortly before murder victim Odin Lloyd was shot dead. The list, which was on Hernandez's Blackberry, contains mostly football related tasks, like purchasing fish oil, watching game film and memorizing the playbook, but also says 'send rounds.' And according to Kyle Aspinwall, who works for Glock and is testifying for the prosecution, this is another way of saying purchase ammunition. Scroll down for video . Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez, left, speaks with his defense attorney Charles Rankin, right, during his murder trial Thursda . Kyle Aspinwall, an employee of Glock firearms manufacturer, examines a pistol while testifying during the murder trial . The list also included 'troll,' a form of online harassment generally popular among teenagers. This as the jury was asked to disregard some of the expert testimony delivered by Aspinwall on Wednesday when he claimed that Hernandez could be seen holding a gun on security footage from inside his home both before and after the time Lloyd is believed to have been killed. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh said that jurors were to disregard some of the identifying characteristics of the gun Aspinwall testified to, and also reminded them that he was speaking to his opinion, which they could accept or disregard. Aspinwall said Hernandez appeared to be carrying a Glock in his residence around 3:30am on June 17, just minutes after Lloyd was killed in a nearby industrial park with what the prosecution claims was a .45-caliber Glock handgun. When questioned by the defense however, Aspinwall said he could not say if the gun was a functioning gun or even a pellet gun. Hernandez looks on as a still frame from surveillance video is displayed on a monitor during his murder trial in . The defense also went after him by pointing out that if it was indeed a gun, Hernandez would have to be holding it by the muzzle, something that would be incredibly unsafe should the weapon accidentally fire. Hernandez, 25, has pleaded not guilty the to murder of Lloyd. He is also charged in another case with the murder of two Boston men in 2012 after a brief encounter at a nightclub. He has pleaded not guilty in that case too.","Jurors in the Aaron Hernandez murder trial were shown a to-do list written by the former New Engalnd Patriots star during his trial on Thursday .

"A high school honor roll student encouraged her boyfriend to take his life because if she didn't, he would just threaten to do it the following day, she allegedly told a friend. Michelle Carter, 18, was charged last month with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Conrad Roy III, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in his truck in Fairhaven, Massachusetts last July. When Roy texted Carter that he wasn't sure he should take his life and had climbed out of the vehicle, she allegedly texted him: 'Get back in.' Now it has emerged that she later told a friend: 'He got out of the car, and I told him to get back in... because I knew he would do it all over again the next day', People reported. Accused: Michelle Conrad, pictured left, allegedly knew that her friend Conrad Roy III, right, was suicidal but rather than seeking help, she encouraged him to take his life in the minutes before he died last July . The magazine reported that in the days before Roy took his life,  Carter texted her friends to say he had gone missing and she feared he was going to take his life. But other texts revealed that she was messaging Roy the whole time. 'Let me know when you're gonna do it,' one of her messages allegedly read. 'It is believed that Carter acted in this way because she was planning to continue to encourage Conrad to take his own life,' police said, People reported. 'So as a result she was beginning to put together a plan to get sympathy from her friends, which was evident because at this point she already started explaining that it's her fault that Conrad is dead, even though he was still alive and speaking and texting with her regularly.' Police and prosecutors say the pair exchanged more than 1,000 text messages in the days leading up to his death in the parking lot of a Fairhaven Kmart on July 13, 2014. Before his suicide, Conrad told her he was scared and not ready to leave his family, according to a police report, but 'she continued to encourage him to take his own life', the Sun Chronicle reported. 'When he actually started to carry out the act, he got scared again and exited his truck, but instead of telling him to stay out of the truck ... Carter told him to 'get back in',' the police report said. Tribute: In the hours after he was found dead, Carter shared this message to her Twitter page . 'Duplicitous': Three days after she allegedly encouraged him to take his life, she questioned why he had died . Most recently, just two days before her arraignment, she shared this image of Conrad, adding: 'Really missing you tonight'. She is free on bail but has been ordered not to touch her social media pages . His body was found in the truck after his parents reported him missing, and police found the text messages after looking through his phone. Carter messaged one of her friends nearly a week later expressing her fears that her messages to Roy had been found, People reported. 'I just got off the phone with Conrads mom about 20 mins ago and she told me that detectives had to come and go thru his things and stuff,' she wrote. 'They read my messages with him I'm done... His family will hate me and I could go to jail.' Even though Carter, who met Roy while on a vacation to Florida several years earlier, reportedly called herself his 'girlfriend', his friends and family said they never knew of the relationship. Friend Louie Pina, 19, told People of the first time he saw her: 'I didn't even know who she was. She was just like a random face.' After the death, Carter, who attends King Philip Regional High School, started raising money and awareness for suicide prevention and organized a fundraising softball tournament last September. Tragic: Roy had struggled with anxiety throughout school, his family said, and canceled plans to go to college . In a description for the event, 'Homers for Conrad', Carter wrote: 'Life can be tough, but helping others makes it easier.' She later wrote on Twitter that the event had raised $2,300. Carter has also repeatedly posted online about how much she misses her friend. 'Such a beautiful soul gone too soon,' she wrote on the day of his death. 'I'll always remember your bright light and smile. You'll forever be in my heart, I love you Conrad.' Three days later, she added: 'I will never understand why this had to happen.' Her most recent message - written just two days before her indictment - reads: 'Enjoy the parade from up there tomorrow Conrad, I know you would of loved to be there ♥ Really missing you tonight.' Carter, who was 17 at the time of Roy's suicide, was indicted on February 5 and arraigned on an involuntary manslaughter charge the next day in New Bedford Juvenile Court. The high school senior was charged as a youthful offender, which means her case is open and she could face punishment as an adult if convicted. She is free on bail and is due back in court in April. As conditions of her bail, she is not allowed to use the internet or social media and cannot text anyone but her parents. She is due back in court for a pretrial hearing on April 17. Her family have insisted that she is innocent and had been left overwhelmed by Roy's suicidal talk. Free: Carter, a high school senior who's on the honor role, has been charged as a youthful offender, which means her case is open and she could face punishment as an adult if convicted . In a statement last month, they said she 'is not the villain the media is portraying her to be'. 'She is a quiet, kind, and sympathetic young girl,' they said. 'She tried immensely to help Mr. Roy in his battle with depression. We know that once all of the facts are released, our daughter will be found innocent.' Conrad Roy had graduated from Old Rochester Regional High School, where he was an all-around athlete who played baseball, rowed crew and ran track, according to an obituary. He had earned his captain's license from Northeast Maritime Institute and worked for his family's marine salvage business. But Roy's father told police that his son suffered from anxiety and had struggled to attend school, and that he had got into Fitchburg State University but had canceled his plans to go. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Michelle Carter 'sent Conrad Roy III, 18, a series of texts encouraging to take his life in a parking lot in Fairhaven, Massachusetts last July'

"Mark Miller has been jailed for almost nine years after he hid in his ex-wife's home to spy on her and tried to set fire to her father and his own son . A man hid in the loft of his ex-wife's home to spy on her before he tried to set his former father-in-law and three-year-old son on fire. Mark Miller, 39, sneaked into the former marital home in Guisborough in east Cleveland and spied on his ex-wife after he refused to accept their 20-year relationship was over. The 39-year-old blamed his wife's father for interfering in their breakup, and when he arrived in a car, also carrying Miller's three-year-old son, Miller attempted to set fire to them - spraying lighter fluid on his former father-in-law. At a hearing at Teeside Crown Court Miller was jailed for eight years and nine months by Recorder James Brown, who told him: 'It is only by great good fortune that a catastrophe was avoided.' Miller was caught hiding in the rafters of his wife's home, spying on her and their children, after using a key she did not know he had to let himself in. The court heard that around 10 years before the attack, when the pair were still together, Miller had become convinced his wife was having an affair and set fire to her bed, holding her in the room saying he wanted them both to perish in the blaze. He was jailed for two-and-a-half years for reckless arson, but when he came out she forgave him and continued their relationship. However Shaun Dryden, prosecuting, said Miller then drinking heavily, hiding alcohol around the house, gambling and demanded frequent sex or he would visit prostitutes. In 2013 the pair split up and Miller began texting his estranged wife pictures pretending to hang himself, taking pills and of gravestones, threatening: 'I can get to your house quicker than the police can.' He had previously been given a suspended sentence imposed for breaching a non-molestation order and a separate restraining order. This had banned him from contacting his ex-wife or coming within 200 metres of her home. But he breached this when he went to the house again last June as his ex-wife's father pulled up in his car. Mr Dryden said: 'He approached the window and said 'This is the last f****** time you will interfere' and began flicking the liquid through the driver's window. Teeside Crown Court heard that Miller sprayed lighter fluid onto his former father-in-law through a car window . '[The man's] shirt and trousers were drenched. He began trying to activate the windows to close them while the defendant fumbled with a lighter trying to light it.' He was convinced Miller would set him on fire and the court heard he had 'never been so frightened.' In a victim impact statement read out in court, Mrs Miller I feel angry, ashamed and embarrassed by allowing myself and my children to be victims to this. She said even though her young son was too young to realise what had happened, he remembered seeing his grandfather frightened as he argued with the boy's father. Miller, of Whitby, admitted attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, breaching a non-molestation order and breaching a restraining order. Graham Silvester, defending, said: 'He regrets bitterly the hurt and anxiety he has caused his ex partner and her family. He was far from a well man when he undertook the course for which he falls to be sentenced. He is a hard working industrious man.' Miller was also given an extended three year licence period.","Mark Miller sneaked into his ex-wife's home to spy on her and their children .

"An Australian skier has told of the terrifying moment he was buried during an avalanche while skiing in the Swiss alps. James Mort, from Sydney, was with his Australian friends Andrew Sebesfi and Daniel O'Sullivan when the incident happened on January 30. The rescue of Mr Mort was captured on a GoPro camera as well as the moment the avalanche hit at Les Crosets on the Swiss-French border. Scroll down for video . James Mort has told of the terrifying moment he was buried alive in an avalanche while skiing . The Sydney man penned a blog post about his experience, saying he wanted to raise more awareness of the dangers of an avalanche . On his Tumblr, the Australian wrote he had tried to outrun it by skiing over the top of a frozen creek, but was unsuccessful. 'I looked up just in time to watch the avalanche envelope me,' Mr Mort said. 'The last thing I managed to do before I was completely buried was to reach as high as I could above the snow with my left arm and ski pole.' It was this decision that saved Mr Mort's life and helped his friends locate him. Mr Mort was with his two friends, Daniel O'Sullivan (left) and Andrew Sebesfi (right), at the time . Mr Mort's friends started to dig him out from under the metres of snow after the avalanche . He wrote on his blog he found the whole experience terrifying, saying he thought he was going to die . In video of the incident, Mr Sebesfi, Mr O'Sullivan and a third friend, Swiss man Léonard Ottensmeyer, were unaware of his whereabouts until they find a ski pole sticking out of the snow, which Mr Mort starts waving while buried underneath. His friends call out to him and tell him they were going to get him out. One of them starts to dig through the snow with a portable shovel they have attached to their backpack. His friends found him when he was able to wave his ski pole from underneath the snow to alert them to his location . The avalanche that buried him happened on January 30 while he was skiing with three other people, including two Australians . But Mr Mort shares what he was thinking before he was saved. 'As the snow piled higher and higher, it became darker and darker until I was surrounded by an eerie black silence, broken only by the sound of my slow breathing and racing heartbeat,' he wrote. '""Okay"" I thought to myself; ""You’re dead"". 'I was convinced that they would not find me in time. Unable to move I focused on slowing my breathing, relaxing and conserving oxygen.' Mr Mort describes the relief he felt when he was finally able to see the sky again. 'Soon my vision became brighter and I heard some muffled voices, then suddenly everything went white as Dan and Leonard excavated my face... I cried with happiness and relief,' he wrote. Mr Mort said he wanted to tell his story to raise awareness of how dangerous avalanches could be.","James Mort was skiing with friends on the Swiss border on January 30 .

"Laurence Fishburne is a multimillionaire actor with roles on hit shows on both ABC and NBC and a part in the upcoming 'Superman v. Batman: Dawn of Justice.' His 80-year-old mother, meanwhile, is broke and facing eviction - and her successful son refuses to call her, she told the New York Post. 'He's gone Hollywood.  For 20 years, I funded my son’s career. He promised me he would take care of me. ... To this day, I have not got a Christmas present or a ""Thank you, Mama"" present. He hasn’t given me a penny,' Hattie Crawford Fishburne told the newspaper. Hattie Crawford Fishburn, 80, holds up her eviction notice as she claims she's being kicked out of her Los Angeles apartment - and that her son can't be bothered to pick up the phone . Laurence Fishburne's mother Hattie, pictured with her son on the red carpet in 1999, says she is facing eviction and hasn't heard from her son in over a year . She says she's living on $3,000 a month from social security and her pension from years of teaching in public schools in Brooklyn and Los Angeles. Mrs Fisburne says she's struggling to pay her medical expenses from her arthritis, underactive thyroid, high cholesterol and injuries she sustained in a massive car crash. Montana Fishburne's father reportedly stopped speaking with her she made two porn videos . She's now so far behind on the $1,500-a-month rent on her Los Angeles apartment that she's be evicted on Tuesday, she told the Post. Despite her attempts to reach her son Laurence, she hasn't spoken to him in more than a year, she says. A call to Fishburne's publicist by Daily Mail Online was not immediately returned. Fishburne, who played the iconic character of Morpheus on the 'Matrix' trilogy, is worth an estimated $20million and earns $175,000 per episode of the NBC show 'Hannibal,' according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. In addition to 'Hannibal,' the 53-year-old actor also stars in and produces ABC's 'Black-ish' and is reprising his role of Daily Planet editor Perry White in the new 'Superman v. Batman' role. In 1994, Mrs Fishburne went to the press with reports she was being evicted from her home in Brooklyn, where she had raised her son as a single mother. Laurence was a child star, appearing on state at age 10 and in soap operas by 12. At age 14, he lied his way into a role in 'Apocalypse Now' by claiming he was 18. The father-of-three has had other estrangements from his family, according to the Post. His daughter Montana says he stopped speaking to her when it emerged she was appearing in porn videos. She was last reported to be working as a stripper in Texas.","Hattie Crawford Fishburne says she will be evicted from her Los Angeles apartment on Tuesday .

"QUESTION: The past few years have been awful: my husband left me for his PA. I felt dowdy and middle-aged, so embarked on a programme of exercise and dieting. Even so, I was amazed when a trainer at my gym, who’s 27 (I’m 49), asked me on a date. I want to say ‘Yes’, but I fear it’s undignified and that my body will repel him. What should I do? Rowan advises a woman who has been asked out on a date by her younger gym trainer (picture posed by models) ANSWER: I have a friend who swears the best way for any middle-aged woman to make a decision is to ask themselves: ‘What would Madonna do?’ The Queen of pop would never let a trifling thing such as dignity stand between her and a hot young man. Nor did the director of 50 Shades Of Grey, Sam Taylor-Johnson, put decorum before personal happiness when she wed a much younger actor. Would it have been more seemly to deny herself an unbelievably handsome husband just to ensure the more censorious members of our society weren’t scandalised? Of course, this kind of chutzpah is far easier to talk about than achieve. It comes more naturally to celebrities than mere mortals. But that doesn’t mean you can’t borrow a little bit of that erotic entitlement. This man has gone out of his way to pursue you. It’s also a bit daft, under the circumstances, to be fretful about your body. If he works in your gym, then surely he’s got a good idea of your physique. The simple fact is that he fancies you rotten. In short, why don’t you do this man a favour and take his request seriously? If he’s interesting and sexy, you should simply assess him for these qualities. Treat him like any other man who might have the good sense to ask you out. Please say ‘Yes!’ — perhaps with the addendum: ‘Because I’m worth it!’","Sex columnist tackles a question from a woman whose husband left her .

"The robin, wren and blue tit have made it on to a shortlist to find Britain's national bird. Ornithologist David Lindo, who has featured on TV shows such as Countryfile, decided to promote his passion for conservation after discovering Britain is one of the few countries not to have its own national bird. While America has the bald eagle, Sweden the common blackbird, Japan the green pheasant, France the Gallic rooster and India the peacock, the author and broadcaster said it was hard to believe that, as a nation of animal lovers, Britain does not have a bird to call its own.

Will the Kingfisher be top of the tree after the vote? 1) Robin . 2) Kingfisher . 3) Barn owl . 4) Blue tit . 5) Wren . 6) Blackbird . 7) Puffin . 8) Mute swan . 9) Red kite . 10) Hen harrier . Mr Lindo said he will be speaking to the Government once the public has voted to see if the winner can officially be made Britain's national bird. He said: 'I want to encourage the great British public to vote for the bird that best represents all that is great about this nation. 'Along with the expected contenders - the friendly robin, charismatic puffin and elegant swan - there is one major surprise, the hen harrier, one of England's rarest breeding birds. 'Down to just one breeding pair a couple of years ago, it may already be extinct. Could the majestic hen harrier knock the hot favourite robin off its perch?'

"The body of Frank Viggiano was laid to rest on Thursday in Linden, New Jersey, after the 28-year-old police officer was killed during a horrific car wreck in Staten Island last week. His fellow officer, Pedro Abad Jr., was driving the wrong way and smashed head-on into a truck during the crash which also killed Joseph Rodriguez, 28, and injured Linden officer Patrik Kudlac. Records show Abad, who is now conscious in the hospital, has had two DUI arrests in the last four years. Scroll down for video . Pallbearers carried the casket holding Linden Officer Frank Viggiano following funeral services in New Jersey .

Abad suffered two broken legs in the crash and he is recovering at Richmond University Medical Center in West Brighton, according to the Staten Island Advance. Frank Viggiano was killed in the crash on March 20 . The six-year Linden police veteran was arrested on a DUI charge in Roselle in 2011. That arrest apparently led to no citation or violation. Abad's license was suspended for seven months after a 2013 DUI arrest in Rahway a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission said earlier this week. Linden police didn't comment Thursday on why Abad remained on the force or say what sanctions he may have faced.

"Last night's highly publicised television debate between the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition was intended to focus the watching audience's attention acutely on them ahead of the general election in May. However, the morning after the night before, another name is grabbing the headlines. As Jeremy Paxman's co-host on Cameron & Miliband Live: The Battle for Number 10, Sky News anchor Kay Burley, 54, was charged with managing the audience's questions. Kay Burley, pictured with David Cameron and Jeremy Paxman, was accused of giving the PM an easy ride . Narrowing her gaze at Mr Miliband: The Sky News anchor was trending on Twitter after the programme aired with one user, Imperial Aerosol Kid accusing her of being 'biased' towards Cameron . Perched to left of the stage, wearing a bright pink dress, the presenter caused such a storm while interviewing David Cameron and Ed Miliband, that her name promptly trended on Twitter. Imperial Aerosol Kid wrote: 'I'm not sure how any sensible person can say Kay Burley was neutral last night. I laughed a few times at how biased she was.' While Tommy Ball wrote sarcastically: 'Just watched Kay Burley. Really hard to see where her political loyalties lie. Wonderfully even-handed.' The audience at home also derided the co-host, accusing her of giving the Prime Minister an easy ride, as she asked him questions about Shredded Wheat (in reference to leading for three terms) and even his favourite colour. A spokesman for communications watchdog Ofcom said it had received 131 complaints by late morning today, all of which were about perceived bias against the Labour leader. An Ofcom spokesman said: 'We are assessing the complaints before deciding whether or not to investigate.' Channel 4 also confirmed today that they had received around 300 complaints following the show last night although a spokeswoman couldn't confirm specifically what they were about. Burley was charged with managing the audience participation section of Cameron & Miliband Live . Viewers at home took to Twitter to say they felt Burley, 54, was noticeably softer on the PM . Kay has responded to many of the Twitter responses...surmising that both herself and Jeremy Paxman were 'alternately accused of being pro and anti both Cameron and Miliband' The news anchor took to Twitter herself to refute accusations of bias. She posted after the debate: 'I see JP [Jeremy Paxman] and I are being alternately accused of being pro and anti both Cameron and Miliband. Our work here is done #BattleForNumber10.' Later, when another user accused her of 'telling porkies' about the reaction of viewers on Twitter, Burley responded that '@Ed_Miliband team disagreed', suggesting the Labour party team were happy with Burley's questioning of Mr Miliband. A Channel 4 spokeswoman said both parties had been happy with the format: 'Both politicians, one of whom is likely to be the next Prime Minister, agreed to the format and were prepared for and actively participated in robust questioning about their policies and abilities. Neither party has expressed any dissatisfaction to Channel 4.' Burley, 54, responded on Twitter that the Miliband team were 'happy' with her performance . Making Peter cry: Pop star and television presenter was reduced to tears in 2010 after Burley asked him about whether he worried about losing custody of his children. The star promptly asked for the interview to end . There was an awkward moment during Miliband's questions with the audience when Burley seemed to introduce an audience member as former One Direction boy band member Zayn Malik. The man's name was actually Zaid Malik. Twitter users also didn't miss the opportunity to rake over Burley's previous TV clangers. The Wigan-born Sky News anchor has, on more than a few occasions, prompted a backlash with her questioning. In October 2012, when Burley was dispatched to Machynlleth in Wales to report on the disappearance of five-year-old April Jones, she told volunteers searching for the little girl that the case had become a murder inquiry live on TV. The volunteers broke down at the news. At the time, Labour MP Tom Watson accused Burley of being 'insensitive bordering on cruel'. Complaints were filed against Sky News in 2010 after Burley broke the news to two female volunteers live on camera that the disappearance of five-year-old April Jones was being treated as a murder enquiry . The women were unaware of the latest developments in the April Jones case and were visibly distressed as the cameras continued to roll. Critics accused Burley of 'unethical journalism' In 2010, Burley commented that US Vice President Joe Biden's head looked bruised. 'What's happened to his head?' she asked. 'It looks like he's walked into a door.' Biden was actually daubed in Ash Wednesday ash. In the same year, she reduced pop star and TV presenter Peter Andre to tears during a live interview after asking him whether he worried about losing custody of his children. Andre, who was on the show to promote his new tour was left upset and asked for the interview to end. However, perhaps her most famous gaffe remains her 2001 declaration that 'the entire eastern seaboard of the United States has been decimated by a terrorist attack' as she covered the unfolding 9/11 tragedy. It is a moment that her critics haven't let her forget.","Kay Burley co-hosted C4's Cameron & Miliband Live with Jeremy Paxman .

"A retired teacher knocked his wife out with a dumbbell and then slit her throat in a 'mercy killing' at their £390,000 home because he couldn't cope with her dementia, a court heard. John Colin Bennett, 75, killed his wife Beatrice, 75, at their North Shropshire home after struggling to come to terms with her debilitating condition. His devoted wife of 55 years had been left unable to recognise her husband as a result of Alzheimer's disease and regularly called him a 'double' or an 'imposter'. John Colin Bennett, 75, killed his wife Beatrice, 75, at their £390,000 North Shropshire home (pictured) In May last year Mr Bennett decided he wanted to 'end her pain' and severely struck his wife with several blows to the head with a dumbbell fracturing her skull. He then cut her throat with a kitchen knife before calmly calling 999 and telling operators: 'I've done a terrible thing, I have murdered my wife.' The pensioner was detained in a psychiatric clinic under the Mental Health Act yesterday after previously admitting manslaughter at Stafford Crown Court. Judge Simon Tonking said: 'This wasn't a premeditated killing. It was, in part, an act which you believed to be one of mercy.' The court was told the happily married couple, both retired teachers, were completely devoted to one another but were unable to have children. They were described as a very 'private couple' who lived in Market Drayton, Shropshire, and relied on one another for almost everything. He then cut her throat with a kitchen knife before calmly calling 999 and telling operators: 'I've done a terrible thing, I have murdered my wife' The pair had a 'happy and active' retirement until Mrs Bennett, known as Trixi, began to show signs of dementia in 2011. Prosecutor Deborah Gould said: 'She was an enthusiastic bridge player and her condition first became noticeable whilst she was playing. 'Mr Bennett became plagued with fears about their future, he became depressed, unable to sleep and was on sleeping tablets. 'What undermined the world of this couple was age.' When he dialled 999 to hand himself in, he said: 'She has Alzheimer's. I hit her on the head to stun her. 'I couldn't see her suffer any more so I put an end to it. 'She didn't recognise me as her husband. I have had two years living with this stress.' Michael Duck QC, for the defence, said: 'That which emerges most strikingly is the depth of affection between husband and wife, the way they had supported each other as individuals for five and a half decades. 'On any view, a happy married life. He is contrite in the extreme. The pressures brought to bear on that particular day came together in a tragic few moments.' Speaking at the time of the death neighbours of the couple in the picturesque market town expressed shock at the news. Local resident Paul Dawson, 48, said: 'Trixie was very ill. I can't believe it was murder, he was probably trying to help her die. 'It's just not possible, somewhere like this. I'm just gob-smacked.' Another neighbour James Mullineaux, 68, a retired police officer, added: 'They were a well respected elderly couple just enjoying their lives together.'","John Colin Bennett, 75, killed his wife Beatrice, 75, at their £390,000 home .

"It's the biggest week of the year for chocolate sales, eclipsing demand at Christmas and even Valentine's Day. And just in time for Easter, one of the world's foremost food scientists - Bernard Lahousse - has explained why Easter eggs taste so good. According to Mr Lahousse, it's all down to smell of chocolate which, when presented in Easter egg form, is enhanced. Happy memories associated with Easter firmly anchor positive feelings towards chocolate eggs . Mr Lahousse told FEMAIL:  'The smaller the chocolate layer is, the easier the chocolate will melt. 'So that is the advantage of Easter eggs; they melt easily and the aromas of the chocolate come into your nose quite fast.' There are a number of reasons why chocolate tastes so good - and like Mr Lahousse explained - the majority of them have to do with the way chocolate smells. 'Chocolate contains a lot of different aroma molecules,' he said. 'It has roasted molecules and fruity molecules. 'These molecules contain a lot of complexity which makes it possible for chocolate to be paired with a lot of ingredients. And it's not just the smell of chocolate that makes it so appealing. 'There are a lot of taste components contained within chocolate,' Mr Lahousse continued. 'We have sweetness, bitterness and sourness. Plus we can't disregard  the fat component. This melts at body temperature and provides a nice sensation and fresh mouth feel in the mouth. So what happens to us when we eat chocolate? Why does it make us feel so good, so content... so happy? The small chocolate layers in an egg means we get an intense whiff of chocolate when we first bite into it . 'Chocolate contains a molecule called phenylethylamine, which chocolate is loaded with,' the scientist continued. This molecule is said to inspire feelings of love, which is why we feel good when eating it. 'Pairing chocolate with extra ingredients will enhance the feeling,' Mr Lahousse said. 'For instance, by adding long pepper or black pepper it [the molecule] will have more effect.' And finally it all goes down to pleasurable memories and the way your egg is presented to you. 'If you look at food more than half of experience lies outside of the taste. 'You taste what you make out of it; when you wrap it in a nice package,  and it is presented to you by the people who love you, it will make the experience much better.' If you don't have the time to make chocolate from scratch, you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs. Once your chocolate is melted, it will need to be tempered. The cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along, just pop your chocolate into the freezer (no longer than 30 seconds). Place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it. Keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process. Stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature. Bittersweet/ dark chocolate should reach a temperature of 28C-29C;  milk chocolate should reach 27C-28C; and white or coloured chocolate should reach 26C-27C. Once the first batch has melted, add more chocolate to your bowl, stirring as you go along. As soon as the correct temperature is reached, start building your Easter egg layers. Spoon some chocolate into a mould (you can get them from Lakeland, Denny Craft Moulds or Party Delights) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould. You can make it as thick as you like, building each layer as the previous one cools. Once the final layer has been built, leave aside to cool and harden before decorating.","Food scientist Bernard Lahousse reveals the science behind our obsession .

"As five years as Prime Minister David Cameron should have a decent stock of anecdotes to keep a room of voters entertained. But in an advert break for last night's TV election contest the Tory leader took the chance to perform his own party trick. In front of more than 100 voters and studio crew, he recited a verse from his favourite childhood song: Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West). Scroll down for video . David Cameron revealed the only song he knows the words to is Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West), before reciting the first verse . Initial reports that the Prime Minister had burst into song were disappointingly wide of the mark. During a break he told Sky News presenter Kay Burley how the chart-topping song by Benny Hill was the only one he could sing in full. She tweeted: 'Just heard from PM that he can sing Ernie and nothing else...' The Premier could not be persuaded to showcase this talent, but did prove his love of the song by reciting the first verse. Burley added: 'He didn't sing but he did recite 'you could hear the hoof beats pound as they raced across the ground...' Mr Cameron's love of the song first emerged in 2006 when he appeared on Desert Island Discs and revealed it would be one of the songs he would take to the fictional island. 'This really just reminds me of my childhood,' he said at the time. 'When you are asked to sing a song, this is, I'm afraid, the only song whose words I can remember.' The private rendition for the audience in last night's TV studio might explain why he got a relatively easy time from them when the cameras went live. While Mr Cameron was asked about treating the elderly with dignity and the depth of spending cuts, Mr Miliband faced a series of aggressive questions. Mr Cameron waves to the audience after taking questions in the first TV contest of the general election campaign . The Tory leader's first question from the audience was: 'What do you think are Ed Miliband's best qualities?' One of the few off-the-cuff questions from Burley to the PM was: 'Have you ever had three shredded wheat?' When Mr Miliband face the audience, he was first asked: 'You sound gloomy most of the time, are things really so bad?' Another asked: 'Do you not think that your brother would have done a better job? He was better qualified and better positioned.' Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband faced the wrath of voters - and Jeremy Paxman - last night as they were forced to defend their broken promises, judgement and ability to lead the country in the first prime-time TV contest of the general election. They were interviewed by Paxman for 18 minutes each, and also took questions from a studio audience with Ms Burley acting as moderator on the show broadcast on Sky News and Channel 4. This afternoon Ofcom had received 254 complaints  - all of which were about perceived bias against the Labour leader. It is thought they have been generated by a social media campaign sharing a link to the watchdog's website and urging people to complain. Jeremy Paxman appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing Prime Minister David Cameron . An Ofcom spokesman said: 'We are assessing the complaints before deciding whether or not to investigate.' A Channel 4 spokeswoman said it had received around 300 complaints, but was unable to say specifically what they were about. 'Both politicians, one of whom is likely to be the next Prime Minister, agreed to the format and were prepared for and actively participated in robust questioning about their policies and abilities. Neither party has expressed any dissatisfaction to Channel 4,' she added. Labour insiders privately noted that they thought Burley 'intervened and followed up aggressively a number of times'. At one point Burley told Mr Miliband: 'That's a politicians answer there isn't it?' She also pressed him on the impact of his leadership victory over his brother David. When the Labour leader said family relations had been strained, Burley responded: 'Your poor mum.' In a series of posts on Twitter, Burley took on her critics. Hundreds of people have lodged complaints with TV watchdogs that Kay Burley and Jeremy Paxman were biased against Ed Miliband . You could hear the hoof beats pound as they raced across the ground, and the clatter of the wheels as they spun 'round and 'round. And he galloped into market street, his badge upon his chest, his name was Ernie, and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west. Now Ernie loved a widow, a lady known as Sue, she lived all alone in Liddley Lane at number 22. They said she was too good for him, she was haughty, proud and chic, but Ernie got his cocoa there three times every week. They called him Ernie, (Ernieeeeeeeeeee) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west. She said she'd like to bathe in milk, he said, 'all right, sweetheart,' and when he'd finished work one night he loaded up the cart. He said, 'd'you want it pasturize? 'cause pasturize is best,' she says, 'Ernie, I'll be happy if it comes up to my chest.' That tickled old Ernie, (Ernieeeeeeeeeee) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west. Now Ernie had a rival, an evil-looking man, called Two-Ton Ted from Teddington and he drove the baker's van. Comedian Benny Hill pictured as Ernie receiving a ticket from a policeman . He tempted her with his treacle tarts and his tasty wholemeal bread, and when she seen the size of his hot meat pies it very near turned her head. She nearly swooned at his macaroon and he said, 'If you treat me right, you'll have hot rolls every morning and crumpets every night.' He knew once she sampled his layer cake he'd have his wicked way, and all Ernie had to offer was a pint of milk a day. Poor Ernie, (Ernieeeeeeeeeee) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west. One lunch time Ted saw Ernie's horse and cart outside her door, it drove him mad to find it was still there at half past four. And as he lept down from his van hot blood through his veins did course, and he went across to Ernie's cart and didn't half kick his 'orse. Whose name was Trigger, (Triggerrrrrrrr) and he pulled the fastest milk cart in the west. Now Ernie rushed out into the street, his gold top in his hand, he said, 'If you wanna marry Susie you'll fight for her like a man.' 'Oh why don't we play cards for her?' he sneeringly replied, 'and just to make it interesting we'll have a shilling on the side.' Now Ernie dragged him from his van and beneath the blazing sun, they stood there face to face, and Ted went for his bun. But Ernie was too quick, things didn't go the way Ted planned, and a strawberry-flavoured yogurt sent it spinning from his hand. Now Susie ran between them and tried to keep them apart, and Ernie, he pushed her aside and a rock cake caught him underneath his heart. And he looked up in pained surprise and the concrete hardened crust, of a stale pork pie caught him in the eye and Ernie bit the dust. Poor Ernie, (Ernieeeeeeeeeee) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west. Ernie was only 52, he didn't wanna die, and now he's gone to make deliveries in that milk round in the sky. Where the customers are angels and ferocious dogs are banned, and the milkman's life is full of fun in that fairy, dairy land. But a woman's needs are many fold and soon she married Ted, but strange things happened on their wedding night as they lay in their bed. Was that the trees a-rustling? Or the hinges of the gate? Or Ernie's ghostly gold tops a-rattling in their crate? They won't forget Ernie, (Ernieeeeeeeeee) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west.","Prime Minister reveals Benny Hill hit is the only song he can sing in full .

"This Sydney luxury unit is a stunning city high-rise but also a chilling crime scene. The Liverpool Street apartment where Simon Gittany threw his fiancée fifteen floors to her death is now up for sale. Gittany was found guilty of murdering Lisa Cecilia Harnum in one of the most high-profile court cases in recent history. On July 30 2011 the former ballerina was thrown to her death from the 15th storey apartment. Her fiance, 40-year-old Gittany, claimed it was suicide and that he had tried to save her life. However, he was handed a 26 year prison sentence in November 2013. The property  where the chilling crime took place is now expected to fetch more than $2 million when it goes to auction on Tuesday. The balcony is being used as one of the unit's key selling points. Scroll down for video . The Sydney apartment where Lisa Harnum was thrown from the balcony to her death is going to auction .

It towers over Hyde Park, on the corner of bustling Elizabeth and Liverpool streets in Sydney's city. The unit was last sold for $1.6 million in June 2010. Gittany rented the property until he was taken into custody.

"A British man has pleaded guilty in New York to plotting to set up a terrorist training camp in the US with hook-handed extremist Abu Hamza. Paranoid schizophrenic Haroon Aswat, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, admitted supporting terrorism and conspiracy and could face up to 20 years in jail.

Aswat, who is thought to be 40, was arrested in 2005 in Zambia and later flown to the UK. He fought extradition for several years and was held at Broadmoor Hospital before being sent to the US last October. In January the European Court of Human Rights dismissed a case he brought against the British Government arguing that his extradition rested on inadequate assurances from US officials about his treatment. His lawyers claimed that it had breached Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Prosecutors say Aswat (background) and Hamza conspired to create a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, 15 years ago . In their ruling at the time, ECHR judges said: 'In light of the specific assurances and additional information received from the United States government, and the careful examination of the case by the High Court in the United Kingdom, the court found that it could not be said that there was a real risk that Mr Aswat would be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if extradited. 'The Court therefore considered his complaint to be manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article 35 of the Convention and declared the application inadmissible.' Aswat's lawyers told the court yesterday that he has been treated for mental illness. He will be sentenced on July 31.","Haroon Aswat, 40, pleaded guilty to supporting terrorism and conspiracy .

"A cow in Northeast Texas has defied great odds and apparently given birth to four calves that have been named Eeny, Meeny, Miny and Moo. Jimmy Barling said Monday that DNA tests will be done on tissue samples from the three bull calves and the one heifer calf to satisfy those who may question the births from one mother. 'We knew she was pregnant, but we didn't know she was going to do this,' the 76-year-old Barling said. 'This was a shock. This blew our minds.' Awesome foursome: Dora Rumsey-Barling is seen here among newborn calves Eeny, Meeny, Miny and Moo near DelKalb, Texas, on March 16. It is incredibly rare for a momma cow to birth four calves . Rare: The cow, described by Dora Rumsey-Barling as 'just a run of the mill red cow', had been bred to an Angus bull, so all four of the calves are black . This momma cow has apparently defied great odds and given birth to four calves. DNA tests will be done to satisfy those who question the veracity of the calves . Barling's wife, Dora Rumsey-Barling, owns the couple's 20 or so cattle outside of DeKalb, near the Arkansas and Oklahoma borders. Rumsey-Barling's granddaughter named the four black calves Eeny, Meeny, Miny and Moo, Barling said. Local veterinarian Mike Baird called the March 16 births 'extremely rare.' He said the odds of four live births from one cow are 1 in 11.2 million. Baird knows the couple well and is nearly certain the four came from one mother, rather than a nearby cow perhaps birthing one or two and then moving along so that it appeared the four came from the Barling's cow. 'In the interest of science and the animal world, it's one of those things that need to be verified beyond a shadow of a doubt,' he said. Proud: Jimmy Barling shows off two of his new calves, after one of his cows apparently underwent an extremely rare pregnancy and birth . The couple watched the birth of the fourth calf after going to check on her when they saw buzzards circling above a field. Because the mother cow is unable to nurse all four calves, the couple are relying on neighbors to help. Moo has stayed with her mother, while Eeny, Meeny and Miny are with two different caretakers. Meeny is the smallest of the calves, weighing in at about 25 pounds. A typical healthy birth weight for a calf is 75 pounds. Standing has also been difficult for some of the quadruplets.","Odds of four live births apparently from one cow are 1 in 11.2 million .

"Staffordshire Police officer Adam Rushton (pictured) denies 10 counts of misconduct in a public office and two counts of obtaining personal data of women without permission . A police officer had sex with four women while on duty, including one liaison at a police station, a court heard yesterday. PC Adam Rushton is accused of letting the woman handcuff him with police equipment in his office during foreplay and sent another woman photographs of himself naked from the waist down. The Staffordshire Police officer also groomed a victim of sexual violence before returning to her home after his shift finished to have sex with her, jurors were told. Prosecutor Duncan Bould said Rushton used his position to engineer relationships with seven vulnerable women - one as young as 17 - during a six-year spell from 2006. A jury were told how the PC attended homes of people complaining of crimes, then left them his personal number. Mr Bould said: ‘You can summarise his charges as: ‘I’m on duty, I’m going to rush (over to your home) so you can give me oral sex before I rush back to work’. ‘He picked one woman up while on duty and took her to Longton Police station in Stoke-on-Trent. ‘He picked her up in a marked car, in uniform, and she had to wait in the car while he checked the coast was clear. ‘Then he took her into the police station, it was in darkness, and he told her to keep quiet, and took her to an office. ‘The only purpose of that was for sexual activity. They began to go further, she put his handcuffs on him, and it was intended to go further but they were disturbed so had to leave.’ Another charge, the prosecutor said, related to a woman his visited at home who he persuaded ‘by a lie or ruse’ to show him her intimate areas. Another woman, who had checked in to a hotel after she had been left terrified to stay at home following an incident of ‘sexual violence’, had sex with Rushton despite his sergeant earlier warning the officer to leave the hotel. Mr Bould said: ‘She was put in a hotel just over night, so Mr Rushton knew he would have to act quickly. Rushton was suspended from Staffordshire Police (headquarters pictured) when the allegations came to light . ‘He set about grooming her by flattering her and flirting with her to show his interest in a sexual way. He then turned up at her hotel at about 10.30pm that night. ‘A sergeant heard about it and attended the hotel and pointed out that Mr Rushton should leave because of the way his behaviour was reflecting on the force. ‘But Mr Rushton didn’t leave, he stayed and had sex with her.’ One of Rushton’s victims told the jury how he had sex with her while on duty, after he had attended a burglary at her home. A few weeks later, he was waiting for her outside her home. The woman said: ‘My relationship with my partner had broken down completely so I was grateful Adam had come round. ‘On his third visit it was different, we didn’t discuss the burglary that time, it was more of a friendship by then. ‘He had been texting me and sometimes he would send me some images of parts of him privately, unclothed below the waist.’ Rushton was suspended after the allegations came to light in early 2013. Rushton, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, denies ten counts of misconduct in a public office and two counts of obtaining the personal data of women without proper permission. The trial at Birmingham Crown Court continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","PC Adam Rushton allegedly had sex with four women while on duty .

"Danielle Liddle, 22, was attacked with baseball bats and a knife while she was in labour, pictured with her two-year-old baby Reggie . A father has branded the masked gang who attacked his pregnant partner with baseball bats and a butcher's knife while she was giving birth as 'sick scum'. Chris Miller, 33, said the five men who assaulted  Danielle Liddle, 22, had 'wrecked his family's lives' and that his partner was too traumatised to return home with baby Reggie. The couple were preparing to leave for hospital when the gang smashed through the front window of their home in Basildon, Essex, with a crowbar. Ms Liddle was slashed in the face with a butcher's knife and beaten with crowbars and baseball bats as her two-year-old son Kenzie slept upstairs. She was rushed to Basildon hospital with a fractured skull and facial wounds, but gave birth to a baby boy despite her injuries. Mr Miller, who was collecting his partner's hospital bag when the gang broke in, said: 'This was an extremely traumatic experience for us both. 'My girlfriend remains in hospital with a serious head injury when she should be celebrating the birth of our child. He relived the moment the gang smashed their way into the home and appealed for help to find those responsible. 'My partner's contractions were about six minutes apart, so I went upstairs to get her hospital bag and to phone the babysitter to come and look after our two-year-old,' he said. 'The next thing I heard a loud smash - like a fish tank shattering. 'My partner started screaming my name and I just heard these men shouting something like 'where's the money?', 'give us the money!'.' 'I came down running down the stairs and they were attacking her. I just threw my arms round her to protect her. 'They carried on beating us. I was just shouting back at them, 'you are wrong man, she is in labour'. 'Me and my girlfriend just started screaming and shouting for help. 'I can't even describe to you how angry I am. My partner is too traumatised to even go back to our home. Ms Liddle and her partner Chris Miller were attacked when a masked gang burst into her home  in Beambridge (pictured), Essex . 'She is going to need counselling to help her get through this. To do this to a woman who is in labour - it's sick.' Ms Liddle was ten days past her due date when she went into labour at 6am on Monday at her home in Pitsea, Essex. Just before 9pm that night the contractions became more regular so Mr Miller started preparing a bag for hospital. But while he was upstairs a gang of five men - three wearing balaclavas - broke into their terraced home. They were heard shouting 'where is the money' and fled with just an iPad, Sony Experia mobile phone and £60 cash after the attack. Ms Liddle's family say the 'strong and courageous' mum suffered flashbacks of the horrific attack while she was in a hospital delivery room. Her sister Charlotte said: 'They attacked her with crowbars, baseball bats and cut her face with a butcher's knife. The 22-year-old was rushed to Basildon Hospital (pictured) and gave birth to a healthy baby on Tuesday . 'She was screaming for them to stop as she was in labour but this did not stop them. Luckily my two-year-old nephew was asleep upstairs and slept through it. 'My sister has had her face stitched but now discovered she may have a fractured skull.' Police are now hunting the five men, all ages in their twenties with local accents, who broke into the home in Beambridge, Pitsea, on Monday night. Three of the men wore balaclavas and dark clothes, a fourth gang member was white and the fifth was mixed race. Detective Inspector Joel Henderson, from Basildon CID, said: 'This was a shocking attack on a young woman who was in labour. It is vital we get those people responsible off the streets of Basildon.' Anyone with information can call Basildon CID on 101. A GoFundMe account has been set up my mother-of-two Joanne Ahrens, who is aiming to raise enough money so the young couple can rent a new house and install a good security system.

"A Louisiana man who said he shot a man he mistook for an alligator will get a new trial after a jury couldn't make a decision in his second-degree murder case. Robert Chouest, 31, of Cut Off, was charged in the May 22, 2013, killing of Shawn Galjour, 41, of Larose. Galjour was found on his back in a driveway near Chouest's home. After two-and-a-half hours of deliberation, jurors on Saturday were deadlocked 9-3 in a decision on his fate. In Louisiana, at least 10 of 12 jurors must agree to convict someone of a charge. Robert Chouest, left, of Cut Off, Louisiana, was charged in the May 22, 2013, killing of Shawn Galjour, right, of Larose . Chouest's defense attorney said his client had been up for three days and shot at a silhouette he mistook for an alligator as he had no reason to believe anyone would be in his driveway  at 4 a.m. During his testimony on Thursday, Chouest said he'd had about six beers and used crystal methamphetamine the afternoon of May 21, 2013. He also testified that he'd taken about eight Percocet pain pills and, soon before the shooting, smoked about five rocks of crack cocaine. The jury could have found Chouest guilty of second-degree murder, manslaughter or negligent homicide, or not guilty, reports The Courier. 'We fully intend to retry Mr. Chouest,' said Lafourche District Attorney Cam Morvant II. A coroner's report showed that Galjour was intoxicated at the time he was shot. Detectives haven't been able to determine what he was doing near Chouest's home at 4 a.m. A coroner's report showed that Galjour, left, was intoxicated at the time he was shot. Detectives haven't been able to determine what he was doing near Chouest's, right, home at 4 a.m. Lafourche assistant district attorneys Annette Fontana accused Chouest of fabricating the story about the alligator. She also pointed out that the defendant was able to perform his job the day before the shooting, work on his truck, drive and effectively use a rifle, despite being on drugs. 'It was a perfect shot to the head, just like he said he was aiming for,' she said. 'He shot to kill. He just doesn't want to take responsibility.' Attorneys on both sides will have a conference with the judge May 13 to schedule a new trial.","Robert Chouest, 31, of Cut Off, Louisiana, was charged in the May 22, 2013, killing of Shawn Galjour, 41, of Larose .

"Apple is said to have been toying with the idea of launching a TV and streaming service for years and new reports suggest it could finally launch as early as this summer. Unnamed sources told The Wall Street Journal that the tech giant plans to launch a 25-channel service that will be streamed to Apple TV, iPhones, iPads and other iOS devices. Rumours suggest it will cost up to $40 a month making it more like an online cable service than a Netflix rival. Unnamed sources have told The Wall Street Journal that the tech giant plans to launch a 25-channel service that will be streamed to iOS devices. Rumours suggest it will cost up to $40 (£27) a month. The news follows Apple's partnership with HBO for HBO Now (pictured), announced at its Watch event earlier this month . Channels are expected to include CBS, ESPN and FX, but it will strip out some of the smaller channels that come packaged on cable services. It is also expected to only be available in the US, although this hasn't been confirmed. The news follows Apple's partnership with HBO, announced at its Watch event earlier this month. Called HBO Now, the on-demand service is launching exclusively on Apple devices next month and this is said to be a 'taster' for what's to come later this year. At its Watch event earlier this month Tim Cook announced Apple's partnership with HBO for the launch of HBO Now. The on-demand service will offer all of HBO's shows for $14.99 a month. HBO's boss Richard Plepler said: 'All you need is a broadband connection and an Apple device.' There will be a brand new HBO Now channel on Apple TV, iPhones and iPads. The service is launching in April, in time for Game of Thrones and for people who sign up in April, they will get the first month free. Apple also dropped the price of its TV box from $99 to $69 and Mr Cook hinted at plans for an updated Apple TV set. 'Apple TV will reinvent the way you watch television - and this is just the beginning,' said the chief executive. Apple also recently cut the price of its Apple TV from $99 to $69. Last month reports claimed Apple was working on a Netflix rival. Sources at the time said the service would put together bundles of programming, rather than entire TV lineups. And Apple is said to have shown programmers demos of the proposed service, but talks seem to be in the early stages. Apple has made repeated attempts to crack the TV business. In his biography of Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson quoted the late Apple co-founder as saying : 'I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use. It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud.' 'It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it.'' In 2009, Apple proposed a $30-a-month subscription service, and since then the company has periodically tried different strategies. Apple's most recent plan has been to work with pay-TV providers like Time Warner Cable to provide a hardware/software offering to those company's customers.

"Four people have been killed and three others seriously injured following a collision  in the Brecon Beacons. Police have named the 68-year-old women who died as Margaret Elizabeth Challis (pictured) A 68-year-old grandmother and three teenagers have died following a fatal car crash on a notorious stretch of mountain road in the Brecon Beacons. Five teenage boys, all aged 17 and 18, from the Barry area, have  been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving in relation to the incident on Friday night and remain in custody.

The three teenagers who died have been named locally as Alesha O’Connor, Rhodri Miller and Corey Price, all aged 17, from Barry. Another three teenagers are in a serious condition in hospital following the head-on collision between two cars at an accident blackspot. Police said a convoy of five cars was travelling on the notorious A470 road, which runs through the Brecon Beacons in south Wales, when the accident occurred. A green VW Golf collided with a black VW Golf Estate between the Storey Arms beauty spot and the village of Libanus at 10.15pm on Friday. Hundreds of people have taken to social media to pay tribute to the crash victims. Two of the teenagers were students at Ysgol Gyfun Bro Morgannwg in Barry while the third was a former pupil. Dylan Jones, head teacher at Ysgol Bro Morgannwg in Barry, said one of those killed was a sixth form student. He added: 'A former pupil, a boy, has also died and a third pupil is seriously injured in hospital. Scroll down for video . 'We had a junior eisteddfod this morning and some of the sixth form were stewarding the event when news started to come in.' 'I have spoken to parents of the those involved and we are preparing for Monday so that we can offer all assistance and counselling to the pupils.' Police said the five vehicles were racing through a notorious stretch of road in the Brecon Beacons (pictured) A statement on the school's website says: 'Following a car accident we received some sad news about our pupils.

A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman said: 'It is believed that a number of vehicles were travelling in convoy at the time of the collision. 'The black Golf is not believed to be part of the convoy of vehicles. 'Five male drivers, from other vehicles in the convoy have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and remain in police custody. A single bunch of purple irises was tied to a barbed wire fence at the scene of the crash today. Hundreds of people have taken to social media to pay tribute to the four people who died. One wrote: 'RIP rhodri, alesha & corey, always in our hearts! Never forgotten.' Another said: 'So devastated. 4 people snatched away just like that. rest in peace to you all.' The road (pictured) near the Storey Arms in south Wales is a well known local blackspot - a single bunch of purple irises was tied to a barbed wire fence at the scene of the crash today . One wrote about Alesha: 'My beautiful girl, I'll love you always, I'll remember you forever. Couldn't of ever had a better best friend.' The mountain pass road reaches 1600ft as it goes through Storey Arms, the main access point for the climb to Penyfan, the highest mountain in the Brecon Beacons. It is a known accident blackspot - there are two roadside shrines less than a mile away from the scene of the latest crash. Local businessman Jason Griffiths, 47, said: 'It is another tragedy - there are always flowers laid on the roadside. Now there will be more. 'I use this road most days, it is dangerous especially at night. 'There are always flowers alongside it where people have been killed. It is a mountain pass which snakes for about a mile before opening up onto a fast stretch of road.' The road is an accident blackspot - there are two roadside shrines less than a mile away from the crash site . Eyewitness Nigel Shiel said paramedics and fire crews were on the scene 'within minutes' and the drivers in the convoy didn't believe anyone had died initially. He said: 'I came upon the accident just after the ambulance got there. I spoke with some of the lads in the cars not involved in crash, they were all from Barry. 'At the time of speaking to them they believed that all their friends were still alive as we had seen one of them being pulled from the cars. 'It was a terrible scene.' A spokeswoman for the Welsh ambulance service said there were an 'enormous amount of resources on the scene' and believed the incident was a 'head on collision'. She said: 'A rapid response unit conveyed patients into Prince Charles Hospital. in Merthyr Tydfil. 'An emergency ambulance conveyed a patient to University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.'

"Sen. Ted Cruz announced that he is running as a candidate for the GOP nomination in the 2016 presidential race on Monday and promptly sent Twitter into a tailspin. Speaking at Liberty University, Cruz opened the first major campaign of the 2016 presidential season with a kickoff speech courting cultural conservatives and declaring that he will devote himself to 'reigniting the promise of America.' The Christian conservative addressed his religious faith, his father's Cuban roots and his unquestioned conservative credentials, saying 'for so many Americans the promise of America seems more and more distant.' Scroll down for video . No sonner had Sen. Ted Cruz announced that he is running as a candidate for the GOP nomination in 2016  than the hastag '#TedCruzCampaignSlogans' started trending with many people poking fun at the fact that he was actually born in Canada . The majority of tweets featuring the '#TedCruzCampaignSlogans' hashtag were from people mocking Cruz's hardline conservative values . And he asked the enthusiastic crowd to 'imagine a president that finally, finally, finally secures the borders.' 'Imagine a simple flat tax,' he said. 'Imagine abolishing the IRS.' It didn't take long for Twitter to be awash with quips about Cruz and his hardline conservative values which started trending with the hastag '#TedCruzCampaignSlogans'. The overwhelming majority of tweets poked fun at Cruz and amongst other things the fact that he was born in Canada, however some of h is supporters also got in on the act and started using the hashtag to tweet their support for him. A divisive figure even in his own party, Cruz is not expected to be the sole GOP contender for long. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and two Senate colleagues, Kentucky's Rand Paul and Florida's Marco Rubio, are eyeing campaign launches soon. A divisive figure even in his own party, it didn't take long for Twitter users to start mocking Cruz by comparing him to Sarah Palin, questioning his links to large corporations and even accusing him of having 'daddy issues' Following his election to the Senate in 2012, the former Texas solicitor general quickly established himself as an uncompromising conservative willing to take on Democrats and Republicans alike. Criticized by members of his own party at times, he won praise from tea party activists for leading the GOP's push to shut the federal government during an unsuccessful bid to block money for President Barack Obama's health care law. The son of an American mother and Cuban-born father, Cruz is positioning himself to become potentially the nation's first Hispanic president. While he was born in Canada, two lawyers who represented presidents from both parties at the Supreme Court recently wrote in the Harvard Law Review that they think Cruz meets the constitutional standard to run. Should he fail to win the nomination or the presidency, Cruz would retain his Senate seat through 2019. He also could elect to run for re-election in 2018, having broadened his national network of allies and donors during this presidential campaign. While the overwhelming majority of tweets poked fun at Cruz, some of his supporters also got in on the act and attempted to hijack the hashtag to promote what they see as his good points .

"A man in a kilt playing the bagpipes may be a regular feature in Scotland, but beyond the borders it's a somewhat rarer occurrence. But one patriotic bagpiper is taking Scottish heritage around the world as he aims to be the first Scot to play the instrument in every single country. Ross O'Connell Jennings, 25, has played in a total of 34 countries and is working his way around the world to bring Scottish music to the masses. Scroll down for video . 25-year-old Ross O'Connell Jennings is attempting to be the first person to play the bagpipes in every country. The half Scot, half Irishman said his friends thought he was initially ridiculous but are now extremely supportive . A musical fan! At the Giraffe Manor in Nairobi, Ross played for the giraffes to the delight of the creatures, who started marching in a line in time . Ross has so far played at 34 countries, including France, and hopes to complete them all in his lifetime. He usually gets a very receptive welcome when playing abroad, but has had a few close shaves being stopped by Tunisian guards and by Vatican police . Fitting in! Ross says he gets a mixed reaction to the kilt, mostly positive. Here pictured at Doraemonin Tokyo in Japan . The motivational speaker is no stranger to travel, having attended an international school in Shanghai, lived in Thailand for a while, and studied Economics and Chinese at Edinburgh University. His father would always encourage him to take his bagpipes wherever he travelled, and Ross realised that he had racked up an impressive number of countries that he had played in. 'When I told my friends and family that I was going to try and attempt to do every country they thought I was absolutely ridiculous, but are incredibly supportive,' the half Scot, half Irishman said. Ross prefers to travel by himself, as he says it is more fun because he meets a lot of people who are curious about his mission and the kilt. When he was recently in Jerusalem, a girl grabbed him as soon as she spotted his Scottish attire, and insisted that he play on the top of the Tower of David. The bagpipes have also proven to be a way to get out of some sticky situations. When travelling in Tunisia, a police guard stopped his rented car and grilled him on why it was not registered. Having done prior research Ross knew that the bagpipe was similar to the Tunisian mezoued, and ended up playing for them, to their delight, and was allowed on his way. Bit chilly?! Ross has even taken his bagpipes and kilt on the slopes in Canada in a bid to complete his round the world mission . Ross uses the name, The First Piper, on social media accounts, and fans can track his mission on facebook and instagram. Here pictured in Shanghai . Animal audience: Ross has played for a number of creatures along the way. These warthogs in Nairobi appear to be unperturbed by the instrument . Transporting the instrument is one of the hardest part of mission, the bagpiper revealed. As they have to be taken on planes as hand luggage, there are always confused reactions when it goes through the x-ray machine. 'I nearly always get pulled over and asked whether it is a shisha pipe, or a weapon!' he said. When Ross reaches a country they are usually very receptive to his playing. The Vatican police were less than impressed, however, and he was almost immediately accosted by officers. 'They quickly silenced me, but admitted they thought it was kind of cool,' Ross said. Animals similarly seem to appreciate the bagpipe playing, and the adventurer has counted giraffes, goats, dogs and cats among his audience. 'When I was in Nairobi at the Giraffe Manor they were initially hesitant as to how the giraffes would react to the sound,' he said. 'I began playing and they actually starting marching in line, it was incredible.' 'There have been mixed reactions to the kilt though,' Ross admitted. At the foot of Kilimanjaro he encountered a group of ladies who were in hysterics at his attire and playing, one of the older ladies even went as far as to call his kilt 'disgusting.' It emerged that she had last heard the bagpipes before her husband went to fight in World War 2. 'It is amazing how the music can bring people together, all over the world,' he said. 'This is something that I am trying to do on my travels, even in a small way.' England . Ireland . Scotland . Wales . Denmark . France . Spain . Monaco . Latvia . San Marino . Vatican City . Italy . Portugal . Switzerland . Germany . Tunisia . Malaysia . Kenya . Uganda . Tanzania . Rwanda . South Africa . Israel . Canada . British Virgin Islands . Cayman Islands . Cuba . China . Mongolia . Taiwan . South Korea . Japan . Thailand . Singapore . When he is not travelling, Ross works in England for a company that runs seminars and motivational speeches in secondary schools. 'Work have been absolutely phenomenal about what I'm doing,' Ross said. 'I tend to get holidays when the school holidays fall, which is great for my travelling.' The musician saves from his job, and has been helped out by generous contacts he has made, and even the Scottish Saltire Society and Smart Turnout menswear have contributed to his mission. Although he does not tend to busk in the countries when he is playing, some people insist on paying for his performance. Japan was where he received the most donations, and he had no sooner opened his bagpipe case to take out his instrument when people were already throwing coins into his box and taking photographs. Ross' next mission is for Ethiopia in April and his travels can be followed on facebook or instagram. When in Rome: Ross does not just want to travel and see what he can get from a destination, but aims to give back to where he visits, and share  his love for music with them . On the go! Ross has travelled to Wenzhou in China in full outfit. The talented Scot is fluent in Mandarin, and even studied Economics and Chinese at university . Sunrise at Lake Bunyonyi in Uganda, allegedly the second deepest lake in Africa. Usually bagpipes cost between £500-£5000, and you can even get gold or silver ones. Ross' cost £1000 . The musician outside the Ivuka Arts Studio in the centre of Kigali in Rwanda. The bagpiper always wanted to travel, but wanted to aim to do it in an unusual way . Ross enjoys travelling alone as it means he is less threatening to people he meets, and it forces him to be sociable and step out his comfort zone .","Ross O'Connell Jennings has so far played in 34 countries and is aiming to take on the world .

"A Fort Worth woman turned 104 this week, and she credits a very special doctor for her good health and longevity: Dr Pepper. Elizabeth Sullivan fell in love with the 23-flavored soft drink 40 years ago, when she was in her 60s. 'People try to give me coffee for breakfast. Well I'd rather have a Dr Pepper,' she said. 'I started drinking them about 40 years ago. Three a day. Every doctor that sees me says they'll kill you, but they die and I don't, so there must be a mistake somewhere.' Scroll down for video . Elizabeth Sullivan turned 104 this week, and on Wednesday the CEO of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Larry Young, surprised her with a very Dr Pepper-filled day . Sullivan has been drinking Dr Pepper for 40 years, since she was in her 60s. She drinks about three cans a day . Larry Young, the CEO of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, gave Sullivan a big surprise for her birthday on Wednesday: a cake designed to look like the carbonated drink's can, a gift basket and plenty of bottles of the pop to drink, according to CBS Dallas Fort Worth. As she reveled in excitement from the day, Sullivan reflected on her age. 'Well at 103 I didn't think I'd make it, but I'm still perking along,' she told CBS. 'When you live to be 104 and can still talk to nice people, you deserve some Dr Pepper, but I never expected this.'

Sullivan taught math at Paschal High School in Fort Worth for 15 years, where she tutored football players for free. She said that the secret to living a long life - aside from Dr Pepper - is to 'just keep living'. 'Man I'm feeling good. I'm glad I'm still here. I'm glad I'm not in a rest home. Glad I can still read books and watch TV and have people come by and say hello,' she said. Sullivan said she is thankful that she's still active at her age and not in a care home. She said she likes that people can stop by her house just to say hello .","Elizabeth Sullivan fell in love with the soft drink when she was in her 60s .

"It took Benjamin Shine 11 years to pop the question and he knew he had to make up for it. So the Canberra-based sculptor took his usual artwork to the next level, this time creating a portrait of himself and his new wife Danielle Stone with 4km of mesh for their big day. The impressive sculpture and installation of the artwork, which took Mr Shine just a month to construct, takes the form of two ribbons which float from the air as they loop and meander around trees and entwine into the silhouette of the couple.

The 37-year-old admits that he had some extra hands to help him make the ribbon by hand-pounding the mesh, but he created his five-metre high masterpiece on his very own. 'No one - not even my wife - knew what I was sculpting until the wedding day,' Mr Shine said. But the bride had arranged a surprise of her own for her new husband. 'The DeLorean is the car of my dreams but Danielle had fooled me into thinking that a blue Mustang was going to pull up and take me and my best man to the wedding venue,' Mr Shine said. 'Instead, this DeLorean emerged and it wasn't just any old DeLorean - it was a Back To The Future Delorean. It seriously was the best ever surprise.'

"The world’s most wanted man avoided a deadly airstrike in Iraq thanks to a bureaucratic dispute, it was claimed today. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was attending a  nursery school in al-Qaim on the Iraq-Syria border, with senior aides and dozens of men set to pledge allegiance to him. An elite Iraqi intelligence unit known as the ‘Falcons cell’ were aware of this thanks to their sources, and the Iraqi air force were ordered to strike the school – but the defence ministry did nothing. Scroll down for video . Target: Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) was attending  a nursery school in al-Qaim, Iraq, with senior aides and dozens of men set to pledge allegiance to him . Officials were reluctant to act after the Falcons did not reveal their target’s identity - before the office of the Prime Minister became involved one hour later, reported The Sunday Times. However by then Baghdadi had left the meeting, and Iraqi fighter jets were instead forced to target a moving convoy of vehicles – not knowing which vehicle he was inside. One of the cell’s leaders said: ‘The strike should have killed Baghdadi if it had happened on time, but we weren't able to reveal the target and the fighter jets moved late.’ The newspaper’s report, by Ali Hashem of Lebanon TV station Al-Mayadeen, told how ten vehicles were destroyed - but Baghdadi was injured in the head and stomach before being taken to safety. Location: An elite Iraqi intelligence unit known as the ‘Falcons cell’ were aware of this thanks to their sources, and the Iraqi air force were ordered to strike the school in al-Qaim, on the Iraq-Syria border . The strike last November - which was reported by MailOnline - saw an aircraft swoop over the meeting of ISIS figures and kill more than a dozen people, according to local government sources. The Falcons intelligence cell is an elite anti-terrorism unit that works under the Iraqi Prime Minister, based in a secret bunker in Baghdad. The group is in charge of charge of counter-terrorism activity in Iraq, and is currently targeting a number of ISIS leaders. A leader from the elite cell - who gave the pseudonym of Major Bakr - insisted that it was 'very close' to getting their target, Baghdadi. The Falcons group was previously in the news in 2013 when its officials issued a letter stating Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of Al Qaeda group the Nusra Front in Syria, had sought to kidnap United Nations workers. Another witness said that eight people had died when a bomb hit a market. A nearby hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including Baghdadi. Local ISIS officials were reportedly roaming the streets ordering residents to donate blood to help the wounded. Striking Baghdadi would have been a significant blow in the campaign against ISIS. Al-Qaim and the neighbouring Syrian town of Albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Baghdadi, who declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims in a televised speech last year, was formerly a prisoner of the US during their occupation of Iraq. The shady figure was eventually released, and rose through the ranks of the jihadist groups which eventually united to form ISIS. World’s most-wanted man: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . The world’s most-wanted man was an impressive footballer known as ‘Maradona’ by inmates at a US detention camp. American forces detained Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion for four years - and he ‘amazed’ others there with his football skills, an ex-inmate said. Baghdadi also used to play for his mosque’s team, with one former acquaintance telling The Sunday Times: ‘He was obsessed with scoring goals - he would turn nervous if he didn’t.’ After his time at Camp Bucca, Baghdadi – who has a PhD in Islamic history - emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world. US officials put a $10million (£6.7million) bounty on his head four years ago when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous. This warrant was publicised once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning. He maintained a low profile for months as ISIS rose to global infamy and even Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'. But last July he revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube.","ISIS leader was attending nursery school in al-Qaim on Iraq-Syria border .

"A mother who was jointly awarded £1.5 million damages after an alcoholic nurse swapped her daughter at birth, has spoken of her pain at being trolled for not recognising her daughter. The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, told how she cried herself to sleep over nasty online messages, accusing her of lacking proper maternal feelings. She was one of two mothers and families whose lives were devastated when their babies were accidentally mixed up at a Cannes clinic in 1994. Trolling victim: The woman, who does not want to be identified and pictured here with her solicitor, has since been abused online for not recognising her own child . Internet trolls attacked her for failing to notice the complexion of her daughter was wrong when she and her husband were both Creoles. 'So many mothers were insisting that it was impossible not to recognise your own child,' she said. 'These horrible messages made me suffer more from my own feelings of guilt. I wanted to scream. 'Nothing was stopping me from turning off the computer, so I was hurting myself all alone'. Both babies were being treated for jaundice when the tragic blunder occurred, the mistake of a nurse who Mailonline understands is now in a psychiatric hospital. Separated at birth: 'Stephanie's' biological daughter Manon was unwittingly given to Sophie Serrano who thought her darker complexion was due to her own Spanish heritage . Blunder: Baby Manon, pictured here with her non-biological mother Sophie, who had no idea she was holding another woman's baby, was placed under a lamp with another baby girl just after birth to cure her jaundice . The woman's biological daughter, Manon, now 21, is still living with the other mother Sophie Serrano, while she has continued to raise Madame Serrano's biological daughter, Mathilde. Earlier this year, Madame Serrano told Mail Online how the unforgivable error had cost her her marriage when her husband refused to accept the daughter she brought home was his. The two families were awarded damages of 1.88 million euros between them by a French civil court after a ten-year fight to prove they were the innocent victims of a hospital mix-up. Now the second woman has decided to speak out about the anger and fear that swept over her when tests proved that both had taken the wrong children home. Using the alias of Stephanie in French newspaper Nice Matin, she told how she was only 19 when she gave birth and had not long arrived from the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, a French territory. She explained that she and her husband, who met when they were 14, were Creoles and had no family with them on the Cote d'Azur. She had lost her parents as a child and was brought up by her grandmother. Stephanie said she did think her baby had changed when the nurse placed her back in her arms but this was quickly dismissed by staff. Teased: Manon was subjected to bullying taunts and whispers that she was the daughter of 'the postman' because her complexion was darker than her mother's. She is pictured above aged nine, just before she discovered the truth about her parentage and was left deeply traumatised . Then and now: Manon, pictured as a nine-year-old before she discovered she had been given to the wrong mother, left, and today aged 21. She wanted to stay with her non-biological mother but has since met with biological mum 'Stephanie' 'Only three little tufts of hair were left on her head', she said. 'I did smile as I told the nurse so, but there was a deep anxiety within me over an eventual mistake. 'She remarked sharply: ' Of course it is your baby'. The moment passed very quickly and I was alone. I reasoned that I was quite young and had faith in them.' Stephanie said she was devastated to learn the truth a decade later and worried that she would lose Mathilde. She was also naturally curious to find out about her biological daughter, Manon, and who she was living with. 'After learning the truth, I felt so angry, but above all frightened. The fear of people taking my child away after she had lived ten years with us. 'Then I wanted to know where my biological daughter was, which family she was in and to know her.' Sophie, left, described the moment she heard that Manon, right, was not her daughter: 'He is not the father,' the lawyer said, 'but you are not the mother either'. Both families have been awarded joint damages of £1.5 million . She was then faced with heartbreaking job of telling Mathilde about the mistake. She went on: 'We took her aside in the living room, sat on the settee and explained to her as simply as possible. 'She said nothing at first and then, with us either side of her, she asked: 'Must I go to the other family? 'We told her that normally, no, but we did not know anything yet. Her reply was: 'In any case, you are my parents'. 'I was impressed by her reaction and still am by the manner in which she has handled it, often better than me even if it was very hard for her'. The two families eventually met in an emotional reunion for all involved. The mother continued: 'Things happened simply with a lot of tears. Mathilde discovered her brothers and sisters. 'Manon, my biological daughter, was acquainted with my children, who are her brothers and sisters'. Both girls, now 21, have been left so traumatised that neither envisage having children of their own in the future.","Anonymous woman 'cried herself to sleep' over cruel internet taunts .

"Not all home owners have enjoyed the famed big returns of Sydney's property boom, analysts reveal. While median home prices have leapt by at least 30 per cent across Sydney, home prices in some of the city's more 'prestigious', mostly waterfront postcodes have hardly budged in the last two years. Analysts say this is because higher-end buyers and sellers are more influenced by fluctuations in the stock market than by low interest rates which sparked the boom in budget and middle sectors of the market. Scroll down for video . The median price of 'prestige' properties in Burraneer, a waterfront suburb south of Sydney's CBD, grew the least of all Sydney suburbs over the last two years . The median price of Burraneer, south of Sydney, is more than $1.5million. This Burraneer home is on the market for an estimated $6.5 million . Seaforth on Sydney's Northern beaches, was ranked the fourth worst performing suburb for luxury sales by Domain Group . Analysts say market conditions haven't suited 'prestigious property', like this $6.5 million Burraneer home, since the GFC . Sydney's eastern suburbs, the northern beaches and the north shore are among the poorest performing suburbs in terms of price growth over the last two years. 'This is the section that has missed out on the boom,' says Domain Group senior economist Andrew Wilson. Burraneer 3.4% . Bronte 7.9% . Sylvania Waters 8.3% . Seaforth 8.4% . Woollahra 8.9% .

(Source: Domain Group) He says Sydney's booming prices have been driven by buyers in the budget and middle sectors of the market taking advantage of low interest rates. But market conditions haven't suited 'prestige property' since the 2007 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) 'We don't have the animal spirit, speculative elements in those markets [that we did before the GFC],' Mr Wilson said. In the waterfront suburb of Burraneer, south of the city, house prices have grown less than inflation at only 3.4 per cent in the last two years. The popular eastern suburbs beach suburb of Bronte grew only 7.9 per cent and the Northern Beaches suburbs of Seaforth and Balgowlah Heights grew just 8.4 per cent  and 10.7 per cent respectively, according to data from Domain Group. Despite the low growth, property agents like James McCowan, from Sotheby's International Realty, say there is still a 'lot of strength' in the very top end of the market - with  homes worth more than $8 million selling well. Woollahra was ranked the fifth worst performing suburb in terms of median home price growth over the last two years. Woollahra is also one of Sydney's most exclusive suburbs, with this home currently on the market valued at more than $1.6 million . The median house price in Bronte, the second worst performing suburb for price growth, is $2.29 million. Agents of this Bronte home  describe it as a 'chance-of-a-lifetime' purchase for its 'fashionable beachfront lifestyle' This Sylvania Waters home is estimated to sell for at least $1.4 million.

"Jagger was wrongly thought to have been poisoned at Crufts, but his joint owners have criticised the Kennel Club for how it dealt with the situation . The owners of a prize-winning Irish setter who was wrongly thought to have been poisoned at Crufts have attacked the Kennel Club for its 'cold' attitude in dealing with the death of the dog. Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Tongeren, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world's biggest dog show. At first his devastated owners believed the dog had been giving cubes of beef laced with poison at Crufts, possibly by a rival, only for the Kennel Club to run tests which showed Jagger had eaten the it 28 hours after leaving the show in Birmingham. The animal's co-owners, Belgian couple Aleksandra and Willem Lauwers and Leicestershire-based Dee Milligan-Bott and her husband Jeremy Bott have criticised the way the Kennel Club handled the situation, and said they faced a barrage of emails from the organisation after the dog's death. 'We accept that we will never know the true facts of why, where and when Jagger ingested poison which resulted in his death,' the owners said in a joint statement, posted on their Facebook pages. 'We wish now to draw a line under this tragedy. 'We are extremely disappointed, the way the Kennel Club have handled the events surrounding the death of Jagger.' The owners said they would have welcomed 'expert advice' with how to deal with the situation and the ensuing press attention. They added: 'That would have been helpful, rather than the cold, impersonal emails and their own press comments regretting that Jagger had died after the show.' Jagger became ill when he returned to the Lauwers family home in the city of Tongeren, in Belgium. The couple called a vet but he suffered a fit and died before the vet arrived. Jagger - known by his show name Thendara Satisfaction - was owned by the couple's young son who was devastated at the death of his pet. A vet acting for the couple carried out an immediate post-mortem on Friday March 6, confirming suspected poisoning. The dog's owners said they had then contacted the Kennel Club by urgent email to its press office to report the dog's death and then faced a 'barrage' of emails from the organisation. Toxicology reports were sent to the Kennel Club last Saturday along with a timetable of Jagger's exact movements, the dog's owners said. Belgian dog owners Aleksandra Lauwers, centre, and her husband Willem Lauwers, were pictured speaking outside their home shortly after the death of their dog and son's pet Jagger, an Irish setter . Thendara Satisfaction, known as Jagger, won second in his class during the second day of Crufts . In a statement issued on Monday Crufts said it was 'inconceivable' that the dog had been given two fast-acting poisons at Birmingham's NEC between 28 and 36 hours earlier. Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko said: 'There has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at Crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog-lovers who came to Crufts that this could not have been possible. 'It is highly likely that the poisons, thought to be on a piece of beef, were eaten in Belgium, shortly before Jagger's death.' They said the poisons - identified as carbofuran and aldicarb - were fast acting and severe symptoms would have set in two to three hours after them being eaten. Jagger belonged to the Lauwers' son Jeremy who was very close to the three-year-old Irish setter . Jeremy Lauwers is pictured with Jagger as a puppy among a large litter of Irish setters owned by his parents . Aldicarb and carbofuran are insecticides which are used in agriculture - but are not approved for use in the EU. Nick Edwards, senior information scientist for Veterinary Poisons Information Service, said: 'We would expect the clinical effects, if ingested by a dog, to be rapid in onset; normally between half an hour and three hours. 'After this time a combination of clinical effects, if the toxins were taken in sufficient quantities, would likely be present, including weakness, collapse, diarrhoea, slow heart rate, difficulty in breathing and excessive salivation.' The comments from the Kennel Club about the poison were made after fears were raised that six dogs had fallen ill after performing at the dog show. There is no evidence to suggest any were poisoned at Crufts and the Kennel Club said there had never been a confirmed case of poisoning in the show's 124-year history. Dee Milligan-Bott was a co-owner of Jagger who took the animal to Crufts, where he achieved second in class . Jagger is thought to have died after eating two fast acting poisons, which the Kennel Club believes he must have eaten after returning to Belgium - rather than at the world's biggest dog show . A spokeswoman for Crufts said: 'As dog owners ourselves we understand how heart-breaking the loss of a beloved dog is and we have continually offered our sincere sympathies and support to the owners throughout all of the contact that we have had on the telephone and by email and we continue to do so.' She said they had offered the families support with making statements about the investigation. 'Both we and the owners have expressed our desire to draw a line under this, so that the owners can grieve privately,' she added. 'The only way the truth about who poisoned Jagger and whether or not it was intentional can possibly now come out is via a police investigation.' Jagger was cremated last week at a special centre for family pets twenty miles from the family hom in Belgium. The Lauwers said they brought his ashes home and plan to spread them in the coming weeks in woods near their home where he liked to walk. They also wanted to spread some of his ashes in Kilby, Leicestershire where he was born and his British co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott runs a kennel.","Jagger, an Irish setter who won a silver at Crufts, collapsed after dog show .

"Jonathan Ross has returned to Radio Two - the station that sacked him over a prank phone call - despite a raft of complaints from listeners. The chat show host is once again standing in for Steve Wright, 60, on show Steve Wright in the Afternoon - despite the BBC receiving 100 complaints since his last cover shift and criticism on social media. It is more than six years since he disgraced himself when he and comedian Russell Brand crudely mocked Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs and his family on air. Jonathan Ross has returned to Radio Two - the station that sacked him over a prank phone call - despite hundreds of complaints from listeners. It is more than six years since he disgraced himself when he and comedian Russell Brand crudely mocked Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs and his family on air . The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with the actor’s granddaughter Georgina and joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls. Brand later resigned and Ross, who had his own regular Radio 2 show, was suspended for 12 weeks . Ross had been hired to cover the afternoon show in February while Steve Wright was on holiday and was once again hosting the show today. But listeners have been left far from impressed. One posted on the Points of View message board: ‘I have read all 70 messages. Many reflect my opinion of this dreadful man. 'I just want to put in a fervent request to the BBC. Please don’t let him back on radio or t.v. I could avoid him on THE OTHER CHANNEL. At the moment he is just spoiling my afternoons, Please make him stop.’ Another added: ‘I’ll find another station to listen to when I go out in the car tomorrow.’ One posted on Twitter: ‘BBC’s shown double standards over Clarkson case - Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand get away with murder!!’ In 2008, Ross used an appearance on comedian Russell Brand’s Radio 2 show to leave obscene messages on Sachs’s answering machine. The Sachs family have refused to forgive Ross and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career . The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with the actor’s granddaughter Georgina and joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls. Brand later resigned and Ross, who had his own regular Radio 2 show, was suspended for 12 weeks. He subsequently moved to ITV, while the BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom for the shameful episode. After last month's show listeners questioned the choice of Ross to stand-in for Wright. One wrote on Twitter: ‘All is forgiven then? Didn’t think @wossy would ever “darken” hallowed BBC premises again.’ Another posted: ‘And Jonathan Ross is on BBC Radio 2 hosting a show because? My God, just shows you can get away with anything and still asked back. Shameful!’ Others said they had switched their radios off, with one tweeting: ‘Disgrace they let this clown back on radio. Never again please.’ Although Ross – who left the BBC in 2010 after it decided not to renew his £18million contract – has said he feels ‘immense regret’, the Sachs family have refused to forgive him and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career. Last month Sachs’s wife Melody said of Ross: ‘I think it’s dreadful that he’s back at the BBC. I don’t like it because of what he did to us. They carry on regardless. He’s never off the box now, is he? ‘He can do what he likes – walk over anybody, say what he likes. I just put it out of my mind and can’t be bothered any more. 'But I’m careful to switch the TV or radio off when he’s on. It’s not very nice, especially the way Andrew’s worked all his life for the BBC on radio and TV. It’s an absolute insult, really.’ Ross will cover another ten shows for Wright next month. The presenter, who has also been guest on Radio 4 panel show Just A Minute since his fall from grace, hosted Wright’s show for four days over the August bank holiday weekend last year, for which he was paid an estimated £4,000. A BBC spokesman told MailOnline: 'Jonathan has stood in as holiday cover on several occasions previously and is popular with the Radio 2 audience. 'Of the 8 million listeners who tune in each week, we've received many messages of support and only a small number of less than 100 complaints.

"It may not look as appetising as a crisp Chardonnay or a rich bottle of Malbec, but grey wine recovered from a shipwreck is definitely more unusual. The bottle of grey liquid was recovered from a US Civil War shipwreck. Now, a panel of experts have sipped the wine and say it had a heady sulphur bouquet with distinct notes of crab water and gasoline. Grey wine recorded from the wreck of a Civil War blockade runner that sank in 1864 waqs sampled by sommeliers, who said it tasted like a mixture of crab water, gasoline, salt water and vinegar, with hints of citrus and alcohol . The bottle was pulled from the wreck of a Civil War blockade runner that sank off the coast of Bermuda in 1864. It was uncorked at a food festival in Charleston, South Carolina, in front of an audience of 50 who watched a panel of experts decant and taste the rare liquid. Master sommelier Paul Roberts said: ‘I've had shipwreck wines before. They can be great.’ But sadly the grey wine was not. The wine was one of five sealed bottles recovered by marine archaeologists (pictured) from the Mary-Celestia, an iron-hulled sidewheel steamship that sank under mysterious circumstances during the US Civil War . To peals of audience laughter, the panel said the cloudy yellow-grey liquid smelled and tasted like a mixture of crab water, gasoline, salt water and vinegar, with hints of citrus and alcohol. Sommeliers were not impressed with the taste of the grey ship wreck wine. Larry Stone of Napa, California is shown looking at the murky liquid . It could have been a Spanish fortified wine, a spirit, or medicine, but after 151 years at the bottom of the ocean, it's now mostly saltwater, they said. Wine chemist Pierre Louis Teissedre of the University of Bordeaux, had previously analysed samples drawn through the cork. He said the ‘nose’ of the wine was a room-clearing mix of camphor – which is used in vapour rubs to treat colds - stagnant water, hydrocarbons, turpentine and sulphur. Analysis showed it was 37 percent alcohol, he said. The wine was one of five sealed bottles recovered by marine archaeologists from the Mary-Celestia, an iron-hulled sidewheel steamship that sank under mysterious circumstances during the US Civil War. The boat was leaving Bermuda with supplies for the Confederate states when it struck a reef and sank in six minutes, said Philippe Rouja, a cultural anthropologist and custodian of historic shipwrecks for the Bermudan government. Whether the sinking was deliberate or accidental has been debated for decades. Mr Rouja and his brother, Jean-Pierre Rouja, were diving near the shipwreck in 2011 after winter storms swept over the site when they found a bottle of wine inside a secret boatswain's locker in the bow. Subsequent dives turned up the additional bottles, as well as sealed bottles of perfume, women's shoes, hairbrushes and pearl shell buttons, Philippe Rouja said. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War, which was fought from 1861 to 1865 and began in Charleston Harbor with the Battle of Fort Sumter.

This image shows the excavation in process . The Mary-Celestia is a Civil War blockade runner that sank off the coast of Bermuda in 1864. The iron-hulled sidewheel steamship sank under mysterious circumstances. Leaving Bermuda with supplies for the Confederate states, the boat struck a reef and sank in six minutes. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln imposed a naval blockade of the US coast from Virginia to Texas in a bid to stop exports of southern cotton, turpentine and tobacco to Europe - crippling it financially. Subsequent dives turned up the additional bottles, as well as sealed bottles of perfume, women's shoes, hairbrushes and pearl shell buttons. The bottle containing the grey 'wine' is shown . The southern response to the blockade was the blockade runner - fast steamships that were manned by daredevil crews who could come under fire and faced possible imprisonment. The boats were highly profitable and saw the goods they carried selling for 200 to 700 per cent more than they had in peacetime, Archaeology.org reported. Mary-Celestia was one of them and was commissioned by two brothers in Virginia to serve their business interests in Great Britain and its colonies, including Bermuda. In its short lifetime, the ship is believed to have been chased by a US Navy blockader but escaped, leading the crew to throw 100 bales of cotton, worth $100,000 overboard to lighten the load. On its final voyage the ship was loaded with canned meat and guns. A crew member spotted rocks as the vessel approached the southern shore of Bermuda, but the pilot didn’t heed the warning and the ship struck the reef. With the crew scrambling for lifeboats, the ship sank rapidly. Sinking after just two years of service rumours were rife that the pilot had deliberately wrecked the ship, but there is no evidence to suggest that he was working for the US Consul in Bermuda. Much of the cargo was retrieved, but items like wine bottles, shoes, perfume bottles and other personal effects were left behind and were revealed after Hurricane Bill in 2009.","Bottle of grey liquid was recovered from a US Civil War shipwreck .

Rhys Hunter (right), who survived the crash, said Rhodri lost control of the car and veered into oncoming traffic . Three people, two teenagers and the driver of the car with Mrs Challis in, remain critically ill in hospital from their injuries. Rhodri, who had only recently passed his driving test, was said to have joined a 'convoy' of six cars before the crash. Seven teenagers, aged 17 and 18, have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving on the notorious twisting stretch of the A470 which sweeps through the Brecon Beacons National Park. Grandmother Margaret Elizabeth Challis also died in the crash . Rhodri and Corey, both pupils at Bro Morgannwg High School in Barry, South Wales, were killed almost immediately in the collision. Corey was a promising football player with the Cardiff City Academy. Alesha, who attended St Richard Gwyn Roman Catholic High School in Barry, and Mrs Challis, from Merthyr Tydfil, were rushed to hospital but died of their injuries in hospital on Saturday. Hundreds of people have taken to social media to pay tribute to the four people who died. Today Andrew Beattie, 37, the step-father of Rhys Hunter - one of the teenagers who survived the crash - told how Rhodri lost control of the car and veered into oncoming traffic. '[Rhys] remembers Rhodri losing control of the car as they went around a corner. 'They went over the other side of the road and hit another car.' Rhys suffered a broken leg and has undergone surgery to have the bones put back in position.

Rhodri turned 17 on October 11, starting driving lessons just two weeks later. A friend said: 'He was delighted to pass so quickly... One of the boys had just had a new car and asked Rhod if he fancied a cruise on Friday - but now this has happened.' Two other teenagers travelling in the same car are still in a critical state in hospital and friends on social media are asking for people to pray they pull through. Mrs Challis, who lived alone, was on her way home from an evening out with a friend when she was killed. Next door neighbour Mandy Driscoll described her as 'such a lovely woman'. Dyfed-Powys Police said the driver of the car in which Mrs Challis was a passenger remains 'seriously injured' in hospital.

"A Chinese actress ruffled a few feathers when she invited Prince William to try the local delicacy - duck necks. Wu Qian met the Duke of Cambridge at the premier of Paddington in Shanghai during his recent visit to China, the People's Daily reported. The Chinese tv and film actress, who stars in the box office smash, was asking William how he had enjoyed his trip when she mentioned the regional dish. Quackers: Chinese actress Wu Qian suggested Prince William tried the local delicacy of duck's neck when she met him in Shanghai during his recent visit . She recommended duck necks, which is a delicacy from Wuhan, provincial capital of Hubei, where she is from. It is not known if the Duke took Wu up on her culinary endorsement during his three-day trip. But his foray to Asia left a lasting impression on Wu who said she spent days learning about British etiquette after learning she would meet the Prince. At ease: Actress Wu Qian found Prince William very down to Earth and approachable when she met him at the premiere of Paddington in China . Delicacy: Duck neck was recommended to Prince William during his recent visit to China . 'Thinking back, talking about food at the first meeting is a bit strange,' she said. Duck neck is a famous Wuhan delicacy which combines SzeChuan style chilli to that part of the bird. Wu, who only found out she was meeting William three days before, traveled back to Wuhan  to choose her dress. She picked a classic 'English-style' dress with hand-stitched flowers to ensure it was one-of-a-kind. 'When I was told that I may be on the red carpet with the Prince I was really terrified. I am still new to the industry and it's my first time to such a big event, she said. 'I was the only female actor at the premier and Prince William asked me some questions about the acting.' Well-received: Prince William stands with the star of the show, Paddington Bear, in Shanghai, China. Prince William was recommended  the local delicacy of duck neck whilst attending the premiere . Young star: Wu Qian met the Duke of Cambridge at the premier of Paddington in Shanghai last week where she recommended he tried a local delicacy . Describing the Prince as 'approachable and humorous' she asked William what he liked eating in China and plugged the spicy dish. William became the first senior royal to visit China, since the Queen and Prince Philip who spent time there in 1986. He met with the Chinese President Xi Jinping and an elephant sanctuary in the southwestern province of Yunnan.","Actress gave her top tip to the Prince when she met him at premier .

"It was hugs all round and a few curtsies too when the Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima arrived in Denmark this morning. Waiting at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport was the Scandinavian country's 74-year-old monarch, Queen Margrethe, her husband Prince Henrik, 80 and their son Crown Prince Frederik, 46. But Maxima, glamorous in a grey coat by Dutch designer Claes Iversen, had serious competition in the style stakes from Australian-born Crown Princess Mary, 43, who was elegant in a nude coat and purple pillbox hat. Scroll down for video . Sweeping a curtsey: Crown Princess Mary of Denmark curtsies to Queen Maxima at Kastrup Airport . Royal welcome: A beaming King Willem-Alexander steps off the plane to be greeted by Queen Margrethe . Like the 43-year-old Dutch Queen, mother-of-four Mary chose Louboutins for the occasion and even managed to sweep a low curtsey, despite the teetering height of the heels. Also on hand to welcome the Dutch royals at Kastrup Airport's private royal terminal were other members of the Danish Royal Family, among them Frederik's younger brother Joachim. 45-year-old Joachim's French wife Princess Marie was also there and wore an ensemble that echoed her sister-in-law's. Queen Margrethe, who along with Queen Elizabeth II, is one of the world's only Queens Regnant, then led the way out of the airport, escorted by King Willem-Alexander. The Dutch royals are at the start of a three-day state visit to Denmark, aimed at strengthening links between the two countries. Unsurprisingly, the programme is a busy one, with Maxima and Willem-Alexander set to criss-cross the country over the next couple of days.

Afterwards, the royal couple will travel north to Aalborg in North Jutland where they will attend a conference at the city's university before flying back to Copenhagen for a reception at the Christiansborg Palace. Tomorrow will see them visit the carbon-neutral Samsø island, accompanied by Crown Prince Frederik and his wife Mary, to visit a special type of Danish boarding school called an efterskole. Most Danish teenagers spend at least a year at the state boarding schools, where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music. The efterskole on Samsø focuses on aquatic sports, diving, aviation and golf, with pupils due to give the royal party, among them sport-mad Frederik, a tour of the school.

By contrast, Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander have enjoyed a smooth ride of late, with Maxima in particular becoming increasingly popular. One of the most glamorous royals in Europe, the Argentina-born mother-of-three has proved a hit with her Dutch subjects, thanks in no small part to her charity work.

"Australia's  property market is continuously booming, with house prices soaring through the roof - but unfortunately for prospective property buyers, it's showing no sign of slowing down. An auction of a quaint, unrenovated Surry Hills home on Saturday reaped surprising bids, with the owner of the property managing to bag a whooping $1.5 million for the home, which didn't even have a bathroom and had holes in the ceiling. On the same day, a stunning beachfront home, owned by former TV comedian John 'Strop' Cornell, in the stylish area of Belongil in Byron Bay was picked up by Harvey Norman heir Glen Norman for $10 million. Scroll down for video . 22 Ridge St, Surry Hills )pictured) sold for over $1.5 million on Saturday . So why are Australia's house prices so extortionate and can we expect more of this in the future? According to Director at LJ Hooker, Brigitte Blackman, low interest prices are pushing up real estate prices and mixed with a lack of stock on the market, things are only set to get worse. 'While we have cheap money, people will just extend themselves,' Ms Blackman told Daily Mail Australia. 'Also there’s very low stock on the market, which I haven’t seen in a long time at this time of year. 'With low stock levels and lowest interest rates ever - which are projected to go down further - moneys cheap and real estates such a solid investment that people are spending big and wanting to buy, but there’s not much to buy,' she said. The house had holes in the ceiling and didn't even have a kitchen . 14 registered buyers turned out for the auction and each battling it out to but the house . About 700 homes went under the hammer in Sydney on Saturday and Domain Group put the clearance rate at 86.1 per cent, the second highest result on record. Ms Blackman sold 22 Ridge St in Surry Hills on Saturday for $1.5 and said everyone was extremely surprised with the outcome, considering the reserve was set at $1.3 million. There were between 80-100 people at the auction and astonishingly 14 buyers registered to bid. The dilapidated four-bedroom Surry Hills terrace was unrenovated with no kitchen, no bathroom and not even a toilet. The home had been in the same family’s hands for more than 60 years, but was left in a state of neglect. Paint was peeling off the walls, holes littered the kitchen ceiling and and the garden was in some serious need of some tender loving care. The house didn't have a bathroom, a toilet or a kitchen but was located in prime real estate . Two other houses on the same street sold last year for less than this house, and they were both renovated . However, what it lacked in amenities it made up for in location and buyers scrambled over themselves to be the one to scoop up the hot property. 'Surry Hills is probably one of the hottest suburbs in Sydney that people want to buy,' Ms Blackman said. 'It was what I call a rough diamond. It had the right orientation, it’s faced north at the rear. There are only a few streets in Surry Hills that do face north at the rear so that was a big plus and it was unrenovated but very solid, it wasn't falling down. 'It was raw, the potential was massive, it was a gem. Buyers saw that and we’re prepared to pay big dollars for it,' she said. This Byron Bay property was snapped up by Harvey Norman heir Glen Norman . The stunning home is set right on the beach and is only accessible by a private path . Two properties on the same street went up for auction last year and both were renovated. One sold for $1.45 million and the other for $1.55 million. 'This one didn't even have a kitchen and barely a bathroom so it was a big surprise,' Ms Blackman said. 'We've got too much demand and low supply so unless the supply comes up it’s not going to meet the demand. I've never heard buyers say to me: ""There’s nothing else to see"", generally they will say: ""I've got five other’s to see today"" -  and they’re not saying that right now. Mr Norman bought the home from his former father-in-law John 'strop' Cornell . Glen Norman sold his Double Bay apartment for $4.5 million last week so he could move to Byron Bay . 'I think it’s a very interesting time, I've been selling for 20 years and I can’t recall another time like this. Noones ever seen these low interest rates before because they've never been this low in our country.' Ms Blackman said she didn't know what was going to happen to the property market but she believes people are more interested in buying now, due to the high rent prices. 'Money’s cheap so people are buying,' she said. 'If you were renting a property and you can afford to buy, why pay someone else’s rent when you can pay your own? That’s why there’s so many people in the market in my opinion.' Further north in Byron Bay a stunning beachside home, formerly owned by comedian John 'Strop' Cornell was snapped off the market by his former son-in-law Glen Norman. Interestingly, Mr Norman's move to Byron Bay's seaside replicates that of his ex-wife, who only returned to live there last year after selling her Bronte home for $4.6 million . Melissa Cornell and Glen Norman were married in 1997 at her father's Beach Hotel but separated in 2004 . Norman had listed his  his three-bedroom apartment in Double Bay earlier this month and was hoping to secure $4 million for the north-facing home, which he bought in 2008. Last week, the Double Bay luxury apartment sold for $4.5 million.

They also sold their other two lots of land overlooking the beach, one for $2 million to Melbourne restaurateur Shannon Bennett and the other for $2.25 million to Bennett's business partner Adam Garrisson . Real estate agent Glen Irwin from LJ Hooker told Daily Mail Australia that they were expecting such a high price for the house, considering the sale price of previous lots in the area .

'There are five paths there and lot one sold for $2.25 million and lot three sold for $2 million,' Mr Irwin said. 'There is no road in front of it and it can only be accessed by path. Its an exclusive enclave of Byron Bay.' Mr Irwin also stated that there was a lot of interest in the property but Mr Norman proposed the highest bid. The sale is just short of the Byron Bay record set in 2006 at $15.68 million, which was set my Mr Irwin . The stunning home is as private as you can get and there is no main road at the front of the house . House prices in Byron Bay have always been high due to desirable location .

A self-contained studio downstairs opens on to manicured lawns and gardens. It also features stunning views of Cape Byron Light-house, Julian Rocks and Mt Warning. However, in a complete turnaround, a 'gingerbread house' in Willoughby failed to sell under the hammer yesterday. The heritage-listed three-bedroom home at 105 Penshurst Street, which features enchanting gingerbread coloured bricks was left on the shelf, despite a lot of interest from buyers.

"Police in Florida have arrested two teenagers for tying a dog to railroad tracks and shooting it. Officers at Tampa Police Department announced in a press conference on Wednesday night that the dog, since named Cabela, was bought from her owners for use in dog fights. Her owners had previously said that she had escaped or was stolen from their yard. She was bought by Natwan Callaway and Bobby Hollinger, both 17, who found that Cabela, a one-year-old pit bull mix, was 'too sweet tempered to fight' according to police. Detective Sgt. Patrick Messmer said a tip led to surveillance footage that showed an individual known to police who was then able to identify other people in the video. Callaway and Hollinger have been charged as adults. One of the two teenagers has a lengthy record to which can now be added charges of aggravated animal cruelty and trespassing. Horrific: Police inlcuding Sgt. Rich Mills (pictured) arrived at the scene to discover the Cabela had been shot three times and tied to the railway tracks . Cabela is now on the mend after her ordeal, and has been inundated with gifts and cards from well-wishers . The suspects turned themselves in voluntarily and have confessed. It is likely additional charges will be filed and other individuals will also be arrested. WTSP reported that in the video police saw a group of people walking the dog towards the railroad tracks in the Sulphur Springs area. Hollinger took Cabela into the woods and shot at her, but she ran away uninjured and was found at home. Callaway and Hollinger caught her and took her back to the railroad tracks, tied her down and Callaway shot her several times, police said. In the video, some people walk away, and then two people are seen running away. Officers received three 911 calls at around 5:23 p.m. on Wednesday March 4 from people reporting hearing gunshots. They heard a dog whimpering while canvassing the neighborhood, and followed the sound to nearby train tracks. Sgt. Rich Mills talks about finding Cabela and investigating the case of animal abuse at a press conference on Wednesday night . Survivor: The young pit bull mix, named Cabela, suffered injuries  so severe it was feared that her front-right leg (right) would have to be amputated. Vers were able to pin the leg instead . Officers discovered the blood-spattered pup had been shot twice in the neck and once in the shoulder and tied to the tracks. They freed Cabela and immediately took her to the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center, where she is staying during her recovery. Her injuries were so severe that it was feared that the pup's front right leg would need to be amputated. However, veterinarians were able to save the leg. A post on the vet's Facebook page read: 'Cabela came through surgery with flying colors and four legs. The surgeon decided to pin it instead of amputation. It will be 6 to 8 weeks before we know whether she will regain full use and motion.' Cabela is doing very well, her bandage was removed on Tuesday and she is already bearing a small amount of weight on her leg. Her chances of making a full recovery are improving . On Wedneday evening following the police announcement that Cabela's attackers had been charged, Katy Meyer, owner of the veterinary practice posted her thanks to police and gave an update on Cabela's condition. 'Justice for Cabela, now that an arrest has been made!' 'We wish to thank the the Tampa Police Department for their thorough investigation into this horrible crime. We hope the individuals reponsible will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.' She added: 'Cabela is doing very well, her bandage was removed last night and she is already bearing a small amount of weight on her leg. Her chances of making a full recovery are improving.' Once Cabela fully recovers, she will be spayed, vaccinated and put up for adoption.

"Mr Putin vanished soon after aides to one of his key allies were blamed for ordering the assassination of one of the Kremlin's most outspoken critics, Boris Nemtsov . Vladimir Putin has admitted that he was ready to place his nuclear attack forces on alert when he seized Crimea a year ago. The Russian president's revelation was aired in a pre-recorded TV interview broadcast at the end of last week. In the documentary – titled Crimea: Way Back Home – he claimed the area was Russia's 'historic territory', even though under international law it remains Ukrainian. Putin went on to say: 'Russian people live there, they are in danger and we cannot leave them.' He also claimed that he feared they would have been overrun by 'a nationalist bulldozer' from Kiev, and said he could not have left the area and the people who live there 'to whims of fate'. However the president explained that he knew the West could have intervened, and had been 'ready' to put his nuclear arsenal on alert, adding: 'I talked with colleagues and told them that Crimea is our historic territory. We were ready to do it.' The Kremlin has since claimed it has the right to station nuclear weapons on the Crimean peninsula. Yesterday's interview came a full ten days after Putin was last seen in public, amid rumours of illness, a coup, or his Olympic gymnast 'lover' Alina Kabayeva giving birth to a child in Switzerland. He vanished soon after aides to one of his key allies were blamed for ordering the assassination of one of the Kremlin's most outspoken critics, Boris Nemtsov. Scroll down for video . The crisis over his disappearance will deepen if he fails to appear this week at a number of events to commemorate the restoration of Crimea to Russia . Opposition TV channel Dozhd has claimed that the president has hidden himself away in one of his many luxurious official residences, a forest hideaway near Lake Valdai in the Novgorod region. But asked yesterday about whether his disappearance from public life was down to a bout of flu, Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov would only say: 'No comment. The topic is closed.' The crisis over his disappearance will deepen if he fails to appear this week at a number of events to commemorate the restoration of Crimea to Russia.

"A Nasa mission designed to study the interaction of Earth's magnetic field and the sun launched this morning at 2:44am GMT (last night at 10:44pm EDT). The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission will use four identical spacecraft to measure a mysterious process known as magnetic reconnection. By orbiting Earth, the spacecraft will seek to understand how energy from the sun is funnelled in to the environment of not only our own but other planets, causing space weather such as aurorae. Scroll down for video . The United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with Nasa's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft onboard is seen here launching from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 in Florida this morning at 2:44am GMT (last night at 10:44pm EDT) The groundbreaking and complex mission represents the first time this astronomical phenomena will be studied in extremely fine detail. The spacecraft were launched on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 421 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. After reaching orbit, each spacecraft deployed from the upper stage of the rocket in five-minute increments. 'I am speaking for the entire MMS team when I say we're thrilled to see all four of our spacecraft have deployed and data indicates we have a healthy fleet,' said Craig Tooley, project manager at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Magnetic reconnection occurs wherever charged gases, called plasma, are present. It's rare on Earth, but plasma makes up 99 per cent of the visible universe, fueling stars and filling the near-vacuum of space. This plasma contains magnetic fields that affects the way charged particles it encounters move. Under normal conditions, the magnetic field lines inside plasmas don't break or merge with other field lines. But sometimes, as field lines get close to each other, the entire pattern changes and everything realign into a new configuration. The amount of energy released can be formidable. Magnetic reconnection taps into the stored energy of the magnetic field, converting it into heat and kinetic energy that sends particles streaming out along the field lines. The MMS mission will help scientsits understand how this process is taking place in the environment around Earth. This could teach us more about geomagnetic storms and aurorae on our planet, and also help us understand similar processes taking place in the rest of the solar system and beyond. Over the following weeks, Nasa scientists and engineers will deploy several complex booms and antennae on the spacecraft, and test all their instruments. The core of each spacecraft is about four feet (1.2 metres) tall and 11 feet (3.4 metres) wide, although with all of their booms and antennae deployed, they grow to 369 by 94ft (29 by 112 metres). The four will then be placed in a pyramid formation, separated by distances of 6.2 to 62 miles (10 to 100km), in preparation for science observations that are scheduled to begin in early September. They will fly around Earth in an elliptical orbit, travelling through two regions where magnetic reconnection is thought to be occurring. One of these is the side of Earth nearest the sun, where plasma from the sun interacts with Earth's magnetosphere. This interaction transfers energy from the sun to Earth's environment, creating 'magnetic explosions' when the magnetic field lines connect. The process of magnetic reconnection can release bursts of energy that are as powerful as billions of megatons of TNT, which send particles surging through space at the speed of light. On Earth, we can see the effects of this in the aurora at the poles, but it can also be dangerous to satellites and cause problems for communications. At the other side of Earth, away from the sun, the spacecraft will pass through a region where Earth's magnetic field lines combine, and produce a similar effect. After reaching orbit, each spacecraft deployed from the upper stage of the rocket in five-minute increments. They were stacked together for the launch (illustrated) The spacecraft will fly around Earth in an elliptical orbit, travelling through two regions where magnetic reconnection is thought to be occurring.

The spacecraft will sturdy the former phenomenon for one and a half years, while the following science phase will focus on the latter phenomenon. 'After a decade of planning and engineering, the science team is ready to go to work,' said Jim Burch, principal investigator for the MMS instrument suite science team at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio (SwRI). 'We've never had this type of opportunity to study this fundamental process in such detail.' The mission will provide the first three-dimensional views of reconnection occurring in Earth's magnetic space environment. But aside from providing more information about our own planet, scientists will use the data to work out how the sun affects other planets, and also how the process takes place in other stars.

The data could also provide information on how magnetic reconnection occurs near black holes and neutron stars, and also at the edge of the solar system at the boundary of our sun's influence and interstellar space. 'MMS is a crucial next step in advancing the science of magnetic reconnection – and no mission has ever observed this fundamental process with such detail,' said Jeff Newmark, interim director for Nasa's Heliophysics Division at the agency's Headquarters in Washington.

"A South African woman who snatched a newborn baby and raised her as her own for nearly 18 years was today banned by a judge from any contact with the child. The 50-year-old was ordered to live at a secret address isolated from the girl she'd brought up and the husband she'd deceived when she appeared in court following her arrest for kidnapping. Yesterday the biological mother of Zephany Nurse who was snatched from her arms in hospital in April 1997, thanked the stranger who had brought her up for 'doing a good job' in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. Today Celeste and Morne Nurse were forced to stand in the packed Cape Town Magistrates Court as the seamstress who had stolen their three day old baby was granted bail with strict conditions. Scroll down for video . Shock: Celeste Nurse, pictured wearing a hat arriving at court next to her ex-husband Morne, has said she forgives the seamstress who took her daughter, who today was granted bail with strict conditions . Horror: Zephany was just three days old when a woman walked into the room at Groote Schuur Hospital and took her from sleeping Celeste's arms - not to be seen again by her family for many years . The stout middle-aged woman, wearing an animal print t-shirt and black leggings, dabbed her eyes with a tissue as magistrate Grant Engel warned her to stay away from the daughter and husband she'd deceived. The seamstress, from a poverty-stricken suburb of Cape Town, looked grief-stricken but managed to smile weakly at a clutch of friends who had gathered to support her in court. Outside court, Judith Wasserfall, a neighbour of the accused was emotional as she recalled the day her friend had brought her baby girl home from hospital in April 1997. 'We were so thrilled for her, she looked so happy,' she said. 'We have watched that child grow up, what a lovely girl she is. 'We helped change her nappies and she was so cute and smiley, everyone loved her, she played with my own daughters. 'As a mother and child they just seemed just to fit together – like a proper family. The mother is a lovely, lovable woman, always smiling and kind and will do anything for you. 'We are all just in shock, and pain. Now the house is empty, and we miss them. 'It was the husband who came to tell us what had happened, when she had been arrested for kidnap. My knees went weak, I felt numb when he told us. 'He looked shocked, broken, he didn't know a thing. No one did, only she knew this secret and she kept it all these years.' Relief: Unbelievably, Celeste has revealed she has already forgiven the woman who kidnapped her daughter . Shock: Zephany (pictured) is coming to terms with the fact her family is not who she thought they were . Zephany, who was given a different name by the woman – neither of whom can be identified – is being cared for by social workers and has met her biological family three times since discovering her real identity. It is understood she has also seen the man she thought of as her father, who was in court but unable to answer any questions, only shaking his head in apparent shock. The girl, who turns 18 next month, learned she had been stolen at birth following an extraordinary twist of fate when her long lost sister, 13-year-old Cassidy Nurse, joined her school. Unaware they were related, the girls struck up a close friendship, despite their age difference, and soon became inseparable. Once Morne, 37, learned of his daughter's new older friend 'who looks just like us', he sought her out and immediately felt an inexplicable bond with the girl. The electrical sales rep then carried out his own investigation into the 17-year-old, scanning her Facebook page for information which would help prove she was the three-day-old baby who'd been taken from his sleeping wife's arms. Anger: There is a feeling of betrayal in the community where Zephany was raised on the Cape Flats, with many questioning how this lie has been able to go on beneath their noses for so many years . Precious: The family only have a few photos of Zephany taken before she was snatched. Here she is with her uncle Abraham Nurse in Hospital on April 29, 1997 . The father of four told MailOnline, 'When I saw Zephany for the first time the feeling was there completely. 'I looked at her and I don't know what it was, but I fell in love with my daughter when I saw her, I thought 'wow what is this feeling?' I don't know how to express myself, it was confusion, attraction, confusion, it was everything all in one. 'And she said later that it was the same from her.' He downloaded a picture of the woman who was raising Zephany from the girl's Facebook page and sent it to a witness who had seen the woman, dressed in a nurse's uniform, carrying the baby away from Celeste as she slept, heavily medicated following a Cesarean section. She confirmed that it was the kidnapper she had seen at the Groote Schuur Hospital more than 17 years before. Morne also sent a photograph of the girl to Celeste, 36, who immediately recognised her as Zephany. 'When he sent me the photo I burst into tears, she looked exactly like Cassidy. She had the same face, ear lobes, nose, she was the same. I said 'this is my daughter'. Instinct: Morne Nurse (centre, arriving at court with ex-wife Celeste, left) said he recognised his nearly 18-year-old daughter immediately - despite not having seen her since she was just three days old . Appeals: The family has worked hard to make sure people don't forget about their missing daughter over the years, including a big appeal in 2010 in the local newspaper the Cape Argus, but no one ever come forward . Once they were satisfied that they had enough evidence, they contacted police who carried out DNA tests and proved they had traced their own child. During the short court hearing, the accused did not look in the direction of Morne and Celeste – who are now divorced. Both families have lived only streets apart for all of Zephany's life and the poverty-stricken community of Lavender Hill, where drugs and gangs are rife, are divided over the extraordinary story. It is understood that the baby snatcher had had a still birth before she took Zephany and was able to breastfeed the newborn and bring her home from hospital without raising suspicion, even from her own husband. The packed, wood-pannelled court heard that the accused is in 'precarious health', and is understood to suffer from diabetes and a heart condition. Prosecutor Bonnie Currie-Gamwo did not oppose the application for bail, which was set at 350 pounds. The woman will have to report to the police station near to her new address which was not revealed in court. Releasing the woman on bail, Mr Engel ordered her to ' make no contact directly or indirectly with any witnesses in this matter, including the child'. He specified that this included 'via Facebook, social media, whatsapp, or sending any messages with third parties'. She is next due to appear in court on May 29.","Seamstress banned from contacting girl she snatched from mother's arms .

"Lil Fatty, Baby Hobbit and Happy Meal are just a few of the bizarre and outrageous nicknames pregnant moms across the country have given to their unborn babies. Ovia, a pregnancy tracking app developed by Harvard scientists, quizzed more than two million of its users about their future children’s quirky monikers in order to discover the most bizarre baby nicknames from all 50 states. 'Baby nicknames are so special because they're one of the first emotional connections a mother has with her unborn baby,' Ovia's director of design Ingrid Pierre told People. Unique monikers: Ovia, a pregnancy tracking app, found and listed the strangest baby nicknames in all 50 states on this map . She added: 'Creating pet names is a very human thing to do. It introduces intimacy into your language with your new child.' While the app's top three chosen nicknames were Peanut, Bean and Baby, Ovia's default option, other parents-to-be, who were asked to come up with their perfect nickname upon signing up to the app, wanted to be as original as possible. Pig products proved to be popular with a number of parents from Nevada, a couple of whom dubbed their babies Pork Bun and Pepperoni. Some mothers from the Lone Star state were filled hometown pride when they chose the names Texas and Lone Ranger for their unborn children, while expecting parents in Massachusetts opted for ferocious fighting monikers such as Little Champion and Lil A** Kicker. And when it comes to picking nicknames for their future children, there were notable regional differences. Southern states favored confectionery inspired names, including King Cake Bebe and Sugarbutt. Special research: Ovia asked more than two million of its users to give their unborn babies a nickname when signing up for the app, which tracks pregnancies . Meanwhile, animals and insects were popular on the West Coast as parents from those states chose Tiniest Bear, Little Ladybug and Lil Bird for their babies' nicknames. And Nebraskans were inspired by music. Little Drummer and Future Rockstar were the unique nicknames chosen by some moms in the Midwestern state. In response to Ovia's findings, People asked its readers to share their unborn babies' special nicknames. 'I nicknamed my daughter Doodlebug and my son Dimples,' one parent responded. Another wrote: 'My sister still to this day calls my oldest son ""Rooster"". She doesn't even recall why she started calling him that.' Although Ovia's research revealed strange nicknames, unique monikers are also in demand for parents who want their children's names to one of a kind creations that are as special as they are. A Swedish company Erfolgswelle charges parents upwards of $30,000 for the creation of tailor-made and 'unheard of' names for their soon-to-be born babies.","Ovia, a pregnancy tracking app, gathered data from more than two million users to find the strangest monikers from all 50 states ."
"A few years ago travellers were happy if their luggage could withstand being battered by baggage handlers while being light enough not to risk massive charges. But a new generation of consumers is demanding luggage that is not only portable and durable, but tell you if it gets lost, and designers are happy to oblige. Bags with GPS trackers, smart phone locking systems and ports for charging mobile phones are among some of the innovative designs available in time for the summer holiday season. Scroll down for video . Proximity sensors lock the suitcase when they detect you have walked away, or it can also be locked manually through the app (shown). GPS tells you where your bag is if it gets re-routed to another flight, and a built-in battery can charge your smartphone six times over . Trunkster features an innovative sliding door as well as GPS trackers and a battery charger . Coming in August is Trunkster, which offers both carry on and check in options. Funded by a Kickstarter campaign, it was created by Gaston Blanchet and Jesse Potash, from New York, They set about creating their ultimate suitcase after tiring of 'brittle zippers, cumbersome flaps, flimsy handles, and unreliable wheels' on traditional luggage. They came up with the 'game-changing' design for the sliding door on the luggage which opens at the touch of a button. 'We're all too familiar with that frustrating moment when you realise you quickly need something out of your bag,' The Trunkster team writes on their Kickstarter page. 'With Trunkster’s revolutionary sliding door, you no longer have to unzip your entire bag and flap it open. The rolltop door lets you instantly access your belongings in one swift motion.' For passengers who are less keen on getting their hands on the latest gadgets and more interested in having enough room for cheeky holiday purchases there is the Fugu. For £399, users can also have a removable battery pack that can charge a device up to nine times, a built-in GPS and a built-in digital scale in the handle. A few months later in October the first deliveries of carry-on suitcase Bluesmart will be shipped out. Designed by a team from New York and funded by an Indiegogo campaign, the bag is connected by Bluetooth to the user's smartphone. Via an app, the owner can lock and unlock it and work out how much it weights. Sensors in the suitcase automatically detect  if the owner has walked away and lock it or notify the user if it is being left behind. The suitcase, which is available for £120 for early backers on Indiegogo will be shipped out by August. 'We came up with the idea for Bluesmart after suffering a couple of bad experiences with our luggage, when airlines forced us to check bags only to have them mishandled or lost,' said Tomi Pierucci, co-founder of Bluesmart. 'We realised that with all the amazing technology available today, we could do better. 'Suitcases haven’t seen much innovation in decades, so we decided to design a suitcase for this century.'

'We realised that with all the amazing technology available today, we could do better. 'Suitcases haven’t seen much innovation in decades, so we decided to design a suitcase for this century.' On this side of the pond, French designer Delsey is working on a prototype smart suitcase called Pluggage. A check lock facility that can tell the Pluggage user if the suitcase has been opened by someone else, an app weather forecast  and an inside speaker are some of the other options being looked at . Not only will the bag contain a battery charger, and scales inside the handle, it will tell owner when it is safely stored in the aeroplane's hold and double up as a sound system with internal speakers. People around the world are now being asked to vote whether they want any other features to be included in the finished product. 'Pluggage will allow ultraconnected travellers to make their lives more simple', Delsey's director of design Albert Engler said. The Pluggage line of three smart bags will be released in the first half of 2016, with a possible price of £399 for a 24-inch model. For travellers on a budget who like the sound of being able to track their bag but are put off by the hefty price tag, Trakdot is offering a GPS system that can be used with existing luggage. Billed as the 'first affordable luggage tracking device', for £79 and an annual fee, users are sent a message saying their suitcase has safely landed - or letting you know if it has ended up in Rome instead of Riga. A new digital lock will hit the markets soon, allowing tourists to lock and unlock their suitcase with a swipe of their iPhone. The designers of the eGeeTouch lock, from US company Digipas, claim to offer a hassle-free alternative to normal locks and keys, offering increased security because it needs a specific smartphone or tablet to use it . The designers of the eGeeTouch lock, from US company Digipas, claim to offer a hassle-free alternative to normal locks and keys, offering increased security because it needs a specific smartphone or tablet to use it. The lock is battery operated which will last for three years, but it can also be charged via USB, and uses NFC (Near Field Communications) to operate; a feature that is compatible with most smartphones. For passengers who are less keen on getting their hands on the latest gadgets and more interested in having enough room for cheeky holiday purchases there is the Fugu. Created by a team of Israeli designers, it triples its volume from 40 litres to 120 litres. The expandable suitcase, which doubles as a closet and laptop table, can then be checked into the hold. Isaac Atlas, industrial designer at Fugu, got the idea for the case when he had to buy new luggage on his way home from a trip because his carry-on bag could not fit in all his extra shopping. On their Kickstarter page they write: 'Today's advanced technology makes nearly every aspect of day-to-day life simpler and easier. Despite these advances, there is one heavily used product that has not significantly progressed in decades: the suitcase . 'Having decided that the time has come to rethink the traditional suitcase, we have developed Fugu Luggage – an innovative lifestyle product that adjusts to meet the needs of the modern traveller.' It will be released by the end of the year. Chairman of the British Travelgoods and Acessories Association Jacquie Sandison said the industry was worth £1.63billion to the UK economy and she believed there would be a strong market for smart luggage in the UK. She added: 'The industry is buoyant and consumers are always keen to source new and exciting travel brands that keep pace with trends, lifestyles and now technology. Manufacturers are innovative these days and invest heavily in research, development and design. It was inevitable that a company would produce products like these eventually. As Smartphone ownership in the UK continues to increase I believe there is real growth potential here for Smartphone compatible luggage, not everyone wants a black suitcase with a red ribbon tied to the handle.'","New generation of suitcases being designed to suit connected generation .

"A woman called police today claiming she had been kidnapped by TV baker Mary Berry . A woman called the police claiming she had been kidnapped by the Queen of British baking Mary Berry today, officers have revealed. Avon and Somerset Police were also called by a drunk man who wanted to find out the football scores this afternoon before proceeding to speak inappropriately. The force has been publishing its calls on Twitter today in a bid to highlight how the emergency call system is abused and the kind of reports received on a daily basis. Among the other bizarre calls was one from a woman in Bristol who said she had aliens in her living room and another reported seeing a cloud shaped like a hammer and believed it was a bad omen. One man called 999 to report that Vodafone was robbing him because he had no service and another rung to get a number for an electrician after his lights went out. Another man reported finding a melon on his doorstep cut into slices this evening and was advised by police the matter was 'not an emergency'. There were also some calls that needed to be passed onto the RSPCA, including one woman who was worried about an emu in a field and someone who claimed she saw a monkey near Bristol zoo.

Becky Tipper, Call Handling Manager said: 'Every day we receive an average of 3,000 calls, 550 of which are emergency 999 calls. Last year 1 in 5 of these calls weren't emergencies.' 'During our tweetathon we will be giving an insight into ""a day in the life"" in our communications centre. 'No two days are ever the same but we are hoping to show the huge variety of issues we deal with. 'If we can help cut the number of unnecessary calls we receive on both 101 and 999, this will reduce call waiting times and improve the experience for callers who genuinely need our help.'

"Three separate bomb blasts in the Nigerian city of Maiduguri have killed at least 10 people and injured several more. One of the explosions was caused by a suicide bomber who detonated a tricycle-taxi, according to witnesses. A military source has said the first two explosions were from bombs - one inside a busy marketplace and the other nearby. The wave of violent attacks which happened within half-an-hour of each other left dead bodies strewn across the ground. Terror-attack: Three separate blasts have ripped through a busy marketplace in the Nigerian city of Maiduguri (pictured in 2009), killing at least 10 people . Insurgents: Terror group Boko Haram (pictured) has intensified bombings and village attacks recently as troops from neighbouring nations try to expel them from the Nigeria-Cameroon border . Another witness heard all the three explosions from about mid-day in the city which houses over two million people. Maiduguri is the state capital of Borno State - the heartland of militant group Boko Haram which has adopted the city as its self-declared capital. A member of a civilian emergency response team said: 'I have counted five ambulances that have evacuated victims . from the scene. 'Soldiers are shooting in the air and warding off . people at the market.' Fish-seller Idi Idrisa who was in the vicinity of the blast says several people were badly wounded. An officer who wishes to stay anonymous says he counted 10 corpses on the ground but the death toll is mounting, with unconfirmed reports of up to 19 deaths. The attack bears the hallmarks of terrorist group Boko Haram which has intensified suicide bombings and village attacks as soldiers from neighbouring countries try to expel the militants from towns along the Nigeria-Cameroon border. Around 12,000 people have died since the group's deadly uprising in north-eastern Nigeria six years ago. The extremists are reportedly amassing forces at their headquarters in the town of Gwoza to prepare for a bloody showdown with the multinational force, an intelligence officer has said. Multinational force: Troops from Chad and Cameroon are trying to battle the threat of Boko Haram in Nigeria, for fear the militants may cross into their countries . Death: Around 12,000 people have died since Boko Haram's deadly uprising in north-eastern Nigeria six years ago . Now the militants are warning civilians to leave the town to avoid being killed in the crossfire, a woman who has been trapped there since July has told her daughter. Hajiya Adama claims her mother left last week and escaped to the town of Yola in neighboring Adamawa state. 'She told me that Boko Haram terrorists asked them to leave suddenly, that they were preparing grounds for a major battle,' she said. 'While being helped by other women to leave through Madagali, they saw many Boko Haram terrorists in trucks and some on bikes moving toward Gwoza.' An intelligence officer has said security forces are being careful for fear of harming civilians - and because Boko Haram has surrounded Gwoza with land mines.","All three blasts occurred within half-an-hour of each other in Maiduguri .

Nishikura told NBC that Miyamoto's selection as Miss Universe Japan 'is a huge step forward in expanding the definition of what it means to be Japanese. The controversy that has erupted over her selection is a great opportunity for us Japanese to examine how far we have come from our self-perpetuated myth of homogeneity while at the same time it shows us how much further we have to go'.

"A federal judge has ordered the US military to release photographs of detainees being abused in Iraq and Afghanistan . U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein's ruling on Friday gives the government, which has fought the case for over a decade, two months to decide whether to appeal before the photos could be released. The American Civil Liberties Union has been seeking to make them public in the name of holding government accountable. The fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it invokes the images of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006. This image shows an unidentified detainee standing on a box with a bag on his head and wires attached to him at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. A federal judge has ordered that more pictures of inmate abuse must be shared by the US military . 'To allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone, somewhere, to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents' misconduct,' said Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director. 'Giving the government that kind of censorial power would have implications far beyond this specific context.' The Defense Department is studying the ruling and will make any further responses in court, spokesman Lt. Col. Myles Caggins III said. Early in the 2004 lawsuit, the ACLU pointed to the Abu Ghraib photos as priority examples of records the organization was seeking on the treatment of detainees. It's unclear how many more photographs may exist. The government has said it has 29 relevant pictures from at least seven different sites in Afghanistan and Iraq, and it's believed to have perhaps hundreds or thousands more, Hellerstein said in a ruling in August. He said some photos he had seen 'are relatively innocuous while others need more serious consideration,' and he has ruled that any images that would be released would be redacted to protect the identities of people in them. Some photographs, taken by service members in Iraq and Afghanistan, were part of criminal investigations of alleged abuse. Some images show 'soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees,' then-Solicitor General — now Supreme Court Justice — Elena Kagan wrote in an appeal to the high court earlier in the case, which has taken a long road through the courts and Congress. The fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it invokes the images of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq (inside pictured) that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006 . The government has long argued that releasing the photographs could incite attacks against U.S. forces and government personnel abroad, and officials have said that risk hasn't abated as the U.S. military role in Iraq and Afghanistan lessened. Indeed, 'the danger associated with release of these photographs is heightened now,' amid the rise of the Islamic State militant group, Navy Rear Adm. Sinclair Harris, the vice director for operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a December court filing. Islamic State, he said 'would use these photographs to further encourage its supporters and followers to attack U.S. military and government personnel.' Amid the lawsuit, Congress passed a 2009 law allowing the government to keep the photos secret if the secretary of defense certified that unveiling them would endanger U.S. citizens or government or military personnel. Defense secretaries have since done so, but Hellerstein said the government hasn't been specific enough.","Follows a long-running clash concerning how prisoners were treated .

"The conjoined twin girls born in Indonesia today were have a very rare condition which means they share a chest, abdomen and incredibly - a heart. Images have emerged showing the babies in a hospital bed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Soetomo Hospital in Java. They fall under the most common type of conjoined twins known as 'thoracopagus' which means they are joined at the upper torso and have just one heart between them, making it 'nearly impossible' to separate them and save both babies. Specialists from the hospital where they were born helped carry out the separation of conjoined twins at another medical facility in South Sumatra in 2013. Connected: The twin girls (pictured) born in Java, Indonesia have a rare condition which means they are joined at the upper torso and share a single heart . Together for life: Babies who share a heart like the twin Indonesian girls (pictured) are 'nearly impossible' to separate successfully . The twins born today cannot be torn apart because they share vital organs but Soetomo Hospital has reportedly performed separation surgeries on 53 conjoined twins in the past. According to a Jakarta Post report, only two of those surgeries failed because of 'anatomy and heart abnormalities in the babies'. Conjoined twins occur about once in every 200,000 live births and their survival is 'anything but assured' according to the University of Maryland Medical Centre. It claims 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn and tragically, about 35 per cent only survive for a single day. The are genetically rare and always the same sex because they develop from the same fertilised egg and share the same placenta. 'Twinning' occurs either when a woman releases two eggs instead of one or she produces an egg that divides after it has been fertilised. Although there are many different types, the most common form of conjoined twins is thoracopagus which means they are combined at the upper torso like the baby girls in Indonesia. These twins share a heart which - depending on how closely they are joined - makes it 'nearly impossible to separate them and save them both'. Risky procedure: Specialists from Soetomo Hospital where they were born have carried out 54 separation surgeries in the past .

"While it may look like a particularly gruesome DIY lobotomy, this Shaolin monk in Chinais showing how he has trained his body to withstand incredibly sharp objects. In a series of stunts that should most certainly not be tried at home, Zhao Rui held a running electric drill to the side of his head without breaking the skin, bent an iron bar against a wall with his throat, and led on metal spears while breaking stones with his head. According to People's Daily Online, Zhao held the powerful drill against his temple for 10 seconds - but only left a small red mark where it had been. Headache: Zhao Rui holds a running power drill against his head for 10 seconds without injury . The display was intended to show how the 24-year-old had trained his body during his years of martial arts training - and his skills have made him a celebrity in his home city of Mianzhu in south-western China's Sichuan province. But the 24-year-old admitted that he has previously accidentally drilled a hole in his head when practising the stunt, ripping off a large piece of skin. He said: 'It was pretty painful but I got better and I learned from the experience and now I can practice pretty often without any problems.' And to prove the point he held a drill against his head for 10 seconds. Bending the rules: He also bends iron bars between his throat and a wall . Scoring points: His routine also involves lying on metal spikes while breaking stones over his head . Eyewitness Lian Tang, 25, said: 'It was incredible because after he removed it, there was no blood, only a bright red mark where the drill head had been.' The kung fu master started learning martial arts as a child after becoming fascinated with the discipline and at the age of 16 ran away to join a Shaolin Temple. He mainly wanted to learn Sanda (Chinese kick-boxing) and 'hard Qigong', which draws strength from the inner energy force known as qi. He studied there for two years before leaving to continue his studies in kung fu from other masters - and now he is a master himself. The drill is just one of the stunts he uses to demonstrate his skill, and he also can use his supertough skin to lie on sharpened spears without any of them piercing his body, or can bend an iron bar by pressing it between his throat and a wall. He said: 'I believe in making my body super tough. Believe it or not I used to be quite nervous as a youngster but now that I can break stones with my head I have found it has given me lots of self-confidence.'","Shaolin monk held running drill against his head for full 10 seconds .

"One of the British twin sisters who have travelled to Syria to become jihadi brides was caught looking at an extremist-linked image on her school computer six months before she fled the country, it has emerged. Salma Halane, 17, downloaded a photograph of ISIS fighters in December 2013, using a computer at Connell Sixth Form College in Manchester. When teachers found out, she told them she was trying to find her brother who had gone to Syria. Terror: Salma Halane, left, looked up an image of ISIS fighters online six months before she travelled to Syria with her twin sister Zahra, right . Six months later, Salma and her twin sister Zahra fled to the war-torn country, where they are believed to have married jihadist fighters from the bloodthirsty terror group. The ISIS-related photograph which Salma viewed online was spotted by teachers when they were reviewing pupils' internet usage. The school says that she was twice spoken to by staff about the picture, and advised to talk to her family about her worries over her brother, while teachers subsequently discussed the issue with her parents. However, staff did not  tell the police of any concerns about the girl. After the twins disappeared in June last year, the school handed all their internet browsing records over to anti-terrorism investigators to help them track Salma and Zahra down. School: Connell Sixth Form College discovered the image on one of its own computers . Jihad: This picture of female ISIS fighters was shared by Salma on her Twitter feed after she went to Syria . A spokesman for Bright Futures Educational Trust, which runs the college, said there was no reason not to believe Salma's explanation for why she was viewing the image. She added: 'As part of the college's daily routine we review all internet browsing records. We promptly challenge students on anything that stands out during that review. 'In December 2013 we discovered that Salma Halane had viewed an image on a mainstream news website in the hope of spotting her missing brother. Our priority was her emotional wellbeing, and we recommended she speak to her mother about her concern for her brother and the college followed this up. 'Once it became clear that the girls had travelled to Syria, we handed over all computer records to the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU). These were reviewed and nothing was discovered that caused them concern.' Training: Another image sent out by Salma appears to show women in burqas being taught how to shoot . An education source told the Manchester Evening News that the school should have done more to intervene after they saw that Salma had been looking at terror-related content online. 'I have no doubt whatsoever that if someone at the college had followed this up with Salma, she would still be in this country,' the source said. 'I think there should have been a real concern that she was becoming radicalised.' Salma and Zahra were among the first pupils at Connell Sixth Form College, which opened as a State-funded free school in September 2013. The twin girls, from the Manchester suburb of Chorlton, had 28 GCSEs between them and were hoping to become doctors before they ran away to join ISIS. Their parents tried to travel to Syria to bring the girls back home, but were unable to persuade them to leave the war zone. A number of British schoolgirls are believed to have left the country to become jihadi brides - last month, three teenagers from East London abandoned their families and travelled to Syria.","Salma Halane looked up a photograph of extremist fighters on school PC .

"The brother of Gregory Smart, who was shot dead by his wife's teenage lover 25 years ago, has said the killer should be paroled. Billy Flynn was just 15 when his teacher and lover, 22-year-old Pamela Smart, encouraged him to kill her husband, Gregory Smart, in their New Hampshire home in May 1990. Flynn faces a parole hearing in Concord on Thursday, his 41st birthday. If he is paroled, he could be free as early as June 4. 'I think he did his time,' Gregory Smart's older brother, Rick Smart, told the Boston Herald. 'He was at a young age. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he shouldn't have been punished, but I want to put this behind me and I'm sure he wants to put it behind him.' Scroll down for video . Locked up: Billy Flynn (pictured in court in 2008) is serving life behind bars for shooting dead his teacher's husband/ He has a parole hearing on Thursday and the victim's brother said he thinks he should be freed . He added that although he would not use the word 'forgiveness' to describe his feelings towards the killer, he has realized that Flynn was influenced by Pamela Smart. 'I feel like he got his punishment,' he said. 'Maybe he can make something out of the rest of his life. What's important to me is Pam stays in jail for the rest of her life.' Pamela Smart remains in prison serving life without the possibility of parole. Their case inspired the 1995 movie 'To Die For.' In the film, Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Suzanne Stone, who becomes involved in a relationship with a teen, played by Joaquin Phoenix. Smart was an instructor in a self-awareness program at Winnicunnet High School in Hampton when she seduced the 15-year-old Flynn, a fellow volunteer. She told him she needed her 24-year-old husband killed because she feared she would lose everything, including her dog and furniture, if she divorced him. Teacher:  Pamela Smart (seen in 1991) was convicted of conspiring with her teen lover, William 'Billy' Flynn, to kill her 24-year-old husband, Gregory Smart. Smart is serving a life without parole sentence . Murdered: Smart's husband, Gregory Smart (seen on their wedding day), was shot in the head in May 1990 . On May 1, 1990, he and 18-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart, a sales representative for an insurance company, to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn shot him in the head. To this day, Pamela Smart denies knowing about the plot. But the state's star witness, a teenage intern in whom Smart confided, secretly recorded her after the killing saying, 'If you tell the (expletive) truth, you'll send me to the slammer for the rest of my (expletive) life.' Smart, whose trial was the first to be televised nationally from start to finish, was convicted March 22, 1991, of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy and witness tampering. Randall got 28 years to life; he comes up for parole in April. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released. Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified in Smart's 1991 trial that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. He was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus credit for pretrial incarceration. Student: In this 1991 file photo,  Flynn testifies on his 17th birthday how he shot Gregory Smart in the head and killed him. Flynn pleaded guilty to killing Smart and  has a parole hearing scheduled for Thursday . Media circus: The trials's lurid details aired on television years before the O.J. Simpson spectacle . Flynn, who is serving out his sentence in Maine, will not be present at the parole board hearing on Thursday and will address the board on speakerphone. Gregory Smart's family members and friends have a right to make victim impact statements. State prosecutors will also weigh in. The three board members are expected to confer among themselves without leaving the hearing room at the state prison in Concord and then render a decision. If parole is granted, Flynn would not be freed before his parole eligibility date of June 4 and only after his final parole plan is approved by the board. Flynn's lawyer, Cathy Green, declined to say what Flynn would tell the board. But seven years ago, testifying on his motion for a reduced sentence, a tearful Flynn took full responsibility for his actions and apologized. 'I promise you I will carry this guilt and remorse with me every day for the rest of my life,' he said. Gregory Smart's father, William, told Flynn then that he might be prepared to see him go free when Flynn reached 40 but that he wasn't ready yet. William Smart has since died. On the big screen: The case inspired the 1995 movie 'To Die For.' In the film, Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Suzanne Stone, who becomes involved in a relationship with a teen, played by Joaquin Phoenix . Flynn married while behind bars, has a teen stepdaughter and has earned his GED and electrician's helper license. 'This never would have happened if it wasn't for Pam Smart,' said attorney Paul Maggiotto, who prosecuted Smart. 'It was Smart's manipulation of Flynn that caused this crime to occur.' Flynn's age and testimony against Smart were taken into account at sentencing. 'I desperately want you to know I'm not that weak person anymore,' Flynn said in 2008. Smart's friend and spokeswoman, Eleanor Pam, told The Associated Press that Smart is not taking a position on Flynn's parole bid but chafes at her life sentence without the chance at freedom. Smart told her: 'If they look at Flynn, they really should take a look at me.' Pam said that while Smart acknowledges the affair with Flynn led to the series of events leading up to her husband's death, she maintains she didn't plan it.","Pamela Smart, then a 22-year-old high school instructor, seduced 15-year-old Billy Flynn and encouraged him to kill her husband .

"Britons who are now in their twenties and thirties will own half as many homes in their lifetime as their parents, a study has shown. According to the research, today’s twenty and thirty-somethings will own an average of 1.7 homes over their lifetime, compared to 3.2 homes for the over-50s. The study, carried out by LV= home insurance, found that a third of homeowners are stuck in homes that are too small for them, but are unable to upsize. Almost a quarter said they could not raise the deposit for a bigger home, while a sixth said they were waiting for prices to drop before even contemplating a move. According to the research, today’s twenty and thirty-somethings will own an average of 1.7 homes over their lifetime, compared to 3.2 homes for the over-50s . Experts blamed rising prices – which have also meant higher stamp duty charges, legal fees and estate agent costs – as well as a housing shortage and stricter mortgage lending criteria which was introduced last April. Many families have instead chosen to stay put and extend their current homes. And moving house has become so unattainable that many Britons said they are already in their ‘forever’ home, including one in five people in their thirties. A separate report yesterday found the affordability of homes in UK cities has deteriorated in the last year and is now at levels last seen in 2009 – with the typical price now more than six times average annual earnings. Selwyn Fernandes, of LV=, said: ‘While owning your own home was achievable for the previous generation, it is an impossible dream for many today. ‘Rising house prices and strict lending criteria are now not only preventing people from buying their own home, but they are also stopping many homeowners from moving, forcing them to modify their homes instead.’ Paula Higgins of the HomeOwners’ Alliance, said: ‘This survey suggests many are stuck in homes which may be unsuitable because they cannot afford to move. Experts blamed rising prices – which have also meant higher stamp duty charges, legal fees and estate agent costs – as well as a housing shortage and stricter mortgage lending criteria which was introduced last April . ‘In different stages of your lives, you have different needs. You may need to move closer to your place of work, or to good schools, or nearer to family. ‘You may want more green space or a more adaptable home. But lots of people are finding they are stuck in their first homes, which they struggled to afford in the first place. ‘Transaction costs, changes to mortgage lending criteria and - critically - a woeful lack of new homes being built puts homeownership, and moving up the ladder, out of the reach of many.’ The survey by LV= asked homeowners whether they were in their ‘forever’ home. They then analysed their age and how many homes they had owned previously. A separate report yesterday found the affordability of homes in UK cities has deteriorated in the last year and is now at levels last seen in 2009 – when Britain was in the midst of an economic crisis. The average house price in cities has risen from £182,000 to £195,000 between 2014 and 2015, with the typical price now more than six times average annual earnings. Lloyds Bank said Oxford was the UK’s least affordable city, followed by Winchester, Cambridge, Chichester, Brighton and Hove, Bath and London. Stirling, in Scotland, was the most affordable, with Londonderry, Northern Ireland, close behind, as well as Lancaster, Bradford and Hereford. Aberdeen recorded highest house price growth since 2005 after the oil-rich city underwent a dramatic housing boom, while London has seen the greatest growth since 2010. Andy Hulme, of Lloyds Bank, said: ‘House price rises in the past two years have resulted in a deterioration in home affordability in the majority of UK cities, and generally widened the north-south affordability divide.’","According to research individuals in 20s and 30s will own fewer homes .

"You might think the secret to a long life is eating healthily and staying away from alcohol. But residents in a Chinese village where most people live into their 90s disagree. In fact they say there is nothing better than a good argument, hard work and a drink. Yu Fangyin, 99, drinks more than 10kgs of rice wine every month and leads a peaceful life in Shuping, according to People's Daily Online. Residents from Shuping in China have given their opinions on what leads to a long life. Yu Fangyin (above), 99, says the key to longevity is a good drink . His daughter-in-law Wang Jiaxiang said it is drinking and smoking that keeps Mr Fangyin happy. She said: 'Apart from these he has no other interests. He is very healthy, is rarely ill, and is a bit of a celebrity in the village.' Mr Fangyin is feeling so healthy that he is hoping to find a wife, jokingly saying that he will start looking 'next year after my 100th birthday'. As far as Chen Zhenglan, 93, is concerned it is not getting married but having an argument that is best. She continually rebuffs her husband Li Changgui, 89, over breakfast about what they are going to eat for dinner. Her claims are backed up by the couple's son Li Tianshun, who said his parents have argued all of their lives with most situations ending with his mother making a compromise. When he spoke to the reporter the 60-year-old said: 'It’s actually good today. The old man doesn’t have much of a huff otherwise he would have walked out already. 'Arguments are part of life. This may be another way to express their love as well as the secret to their longevity.' Most people living in the village reach their 90s. Li Shangui (third from right), 95, says hard work is the best way to stay young, as long as you love your job . Mr Fangyin (above) drinks more than 10kgs of rice wine per month and also enjoys smoking as he sits on a stool in his home . Chen Zhenglan (above), 93, says the secret is a good and loud argument with her 89-year-old former blacksmith husband . The pair met when Mr Changgui was a blacksmith. Mrs Zhenglan said she fell for him and added: 'I am older than him and more mature.' Others in the village attribute a healthy life to hard graft. Li Shangui is 95. She was director of the Women's Association before she started making and mending shoes. In her spare time she helps her family complete their chores. Her daughter Hu Zhenggui said: 'Her eyes and ears are still very sharp.' Her great daughter-in-law Ceng Changping added: 'I tried to learn how to mend the soles of shoes a number of times but sadly I couldn’t figure it out.' Wu Liangfu also believes in working hard. The 104-year-old works as a tailor at his house, as he has done for many years. Li Shangui, 95, was director of the Women's Association before she started making shoes and mending their soles.

Mr Fangyin (right) makes residents laugh when he says that he is going to find a new wife for his 100th birthday . The former soldier said he likes doing things in an orderly fashion as well as reminiscing about the past. 'It is through constant recalling of memories do they become ingrained and your mind will not become dumb,' he explained. 'I love seeing all my children and grandchildren having good jobs.' He said a good mood, maintaining good relations with everyone and not arguing were also key. Mr Liangfu's son added: 'My father was a soldier and an old revolutionary and whenever the subject of war appears he will talk about it for a long time and we all patiently listen to his old stories. Mrs Zhenglan mostly argues with her husband over breakfast (above), allegedly about what they are going to eat for dinner .

According to the babysitter, 28-year-old Jennifer Fortier, Hernandez paid her $250 two days later after she babysat for just four hours. That sum equates to $62.50 an hour, a marked increase of her usual rate of $20 per hour. Scroll down for video . Jennifer Fortier, 28, testified she ran into Aaron Hernandez while she was out with a friend in Boston two nights before he is accused of murdering Odin Lloyd . Hernandez, 25, is accused of shooting Lloyd. He is being tried at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts. If convicted, Hernandez faces a maximum penalty of life in prison . Fortier said he kissed her in a bedroom and then she stopped him and left. Two days later, he paid her $250 . Fortier said she ran into Hernandez on the night of of June 14, 2013, when she and a girlfriend were out in Boston. After they left with Hernandez, Lloyd and a third man, they eventually wound up in his apartment in Franklin. The prosecution commonly refers to that apartment as a 'flophouse'. They were in a bedroom at the apartment when Hernandez kissed her. Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots before he was released . She said: 'I pushed him away,' 'I told him, ""I'm your Nanny. I can't do this."" 'He understood and said it was OK.' Fortier did admit that she initially kissed Hernandez back before rebuffing him and departing. Two nights later, Fortier said she was babysitting at the home of Hernandez and his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins when two men identified as Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz arrived around midnight while the couple were out. Prosecutors have alleged the three men picked up  Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating Jenkins' sister, at his Boston home early on June 17, 2013, and drove him to the industrial area where his bullet-riddled body was found later that day. Hernandez, 25, is accused of fatally shooting Lloyd and is being tried at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts. Wallace and Ortiz also face murder charges and will be tried separately. All three men have pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Hernandez, a former tight-end for the New England Patriots, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. Surveillance video played in court showed Wallace and Ortiz arriving at the house in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, and Fortier answering the door. The $250 sum equates to a rate of $62.50 an hour, a marked increase of Fortier's usual pay of $20 per hour . They arrived in what prosecutors say was a rented Nissan Altima that they later drove to the crime scene. Fortier said Hernandez or Jenkins called her cell phone within 10-15 minutes of their arrival, and that she handed the phone to Wallace, who walked into the kitchen to talk before giving her the phone back. After Hernandez and Jenkins returned, Hernandez went upstairs quickly before leaving with the men at around 1am, she said. Fortier said she talked with Jenkins for about an hour before leaving. Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the Patriots. He was released from the team hours after his arrest in June, 2013.","Jennifer Fortier, 28, testified she ran into Aaron Hernandez in Boston two nights before he is accused of murdering Odin Lloyd .

"A Republican state senator from Maine is in hot water after posting an image on Facebook that suggested U.S. President Barack Obama is going easy on the ISIS terror army because it includes some of his family. The posting plays on the discredited conspiracy theory that holds Obama is secretly practicing Muslim. 'Why haven't I done anything about ISIS? Because I'll deal with them at the family reunion,' its caption reads. Willette, a part-time lawmaker who makes his living selling real estate, shared it March 1 on his Facebook wall.' 'I've been very good over the last year and a half about not posting things about Obama, but this one was too good to pass up,' he wrote in the posting. 'I promise this will be the last one for some time.' Willette apparently found it on the 'Conservative News Today' Facebook feed, which supplies a daily diet of anti-Obama, anti-Clinton and anti-Islam material including 'meme' photos, videos and cartoons. ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, is an army of terrorists that occupies more than two-thirds of Syria and Iraq. The group counts tens of thousands of fighters among its ranks, including many drawn from other Middle Eastern and European nations. Its soldiers have been seen in gruesome videos, beheading captured prisoners and burning them alive. President Obama has embraced a 'coalition' approach of airstrikes to fight ISIS, but has not authorized the Pentagon to deploy American ground troops in the region. In a prepared statement on Monday, he apologized for posting the item – but didn't say whether he still agreed with it. It was no longer on his Facebook page as of Monday afternoon. 'COMMON SENSE': Mike Willette's campaign postcards from the 2014 election season called him a 'rare breed of public servant' 'I apologize for posting this on Facebook,' Willette's statement read. 'Like too many people these days, I fell into the trap of posting something first and then thinking later. It was an error in judgment.' The Maine Democratic Party pounced on the scandal, saying Willette's behavior was 'extremely disappointing and shows a severe lack of judgement.' Party chairman Phil Bartlett's statement slammed Willette for perpetuating a 'false racial, religious and ethnic slur at a time when our state and country should come together.' 'This reflects very poorly on the Maine Republican Party and we urge their leadership to denounce Sen. Willette's actions,' wrote party chairman Phil Bartlett. Willette himself was a Democrat until 2010, according to the Bangor Daily News. He switched parties when the GOP took over control of the state Senate.","'Like too many people these days, I fell into the trap of posting something first and then thinking later,' said Maine GOP state Sen.

"A former New York Stock Exchange managing director has filed a lawsuit claiming he was fired for appearing on the satirical newscast 'The Daily Show' to discuss Obamacare because his bosses objected to the program's politics. In a lawsuit filed Thursday in California state court, Todd Wilemon says his supervisors at Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE), which owns NYSE and other financial exchanges, had allowed him to appear on Fox News, Al Jazeera and other television stations without receiving permission in each instance. After appearing in a 2014 segment about the Affordable Care Act on the popular Comedy Central show without permission, however, Wilemon was promptly fired, the suit says. He claims that while he knew the interview would be edited to poke fun at his opposition to 'Obamacare,' he thought it would be an effective way to draw attention to controversies surrounding the law. Scroll down for video . Foot-in-mouth: Former Intercontinental Exchange Inc. managing director Todd Wilemon made controversial comments on The Daily Show on March 6, 2014, for which he was fired. He is now suing the company . An ICE representative, also speaking for the New York Stock Exchange, declined to comment on the suit on Friday. The March 6, 2014 segment of 'The Daily Show' challenged the notion that the U.S. has the best health care system in the world, with Wilemon, a managing director for ICE from 2009 to 2014, playing the foil. His comments, particularly his exhortation that 'if you're poor, stop being poor,' were widely criticized by left-leaning websites and news outlets. The popular website AlterNet, for example, placed Wilemon at the top of a list of '8 colossal jackasses from the right-wing fringe.' Before he was fired, Wilemon provided information to investors and firms listed on the NYSE's exchanges, as well as making regular television appearances to discuss investing and politics. Days after the segment aired, Wilemon's supervisors chided him for 'mocking the one percent,' according to the suit, and he was fired. Controversial segment: The March 6, 2014 segment of The Daily Show with Aasif Mandvi (left) challenged the notion that the U.S. has the best health care system in the world, with Wilemon (right) playing the foil . The suit says his termination violated a California labor law that prohibits employers from curbing workers' participation in politics. His firing was 'due to defendants' own antipathy for the political message of The Daily Show, which is widely regarded as an influential progressive political platform,' Wilemon's suit says. Wilemon is seeking at least $150,000 in damages under California law, but not reinstatement to his job. Wilemon's lawyer, Richard Levine, didn't immediately return a request for comment.

"When it comes to criss-crossing the globe by plane, it seems jet lag is the least of our worries. Whether you're suffering from dehydration due to low cabin humidity or suffering from pain in your ear canal during takeoff and landing, everything from oxygen deprivation to inactivity can contribute to passengers feeling unwell in the air. Here are some of the scariest health effects of flying... and some suggestions to prevent and combat them. Everything from dehydration to inactivity can contribute to passengers feeling unwell while in the air . Dehydration . While bodies are most comfortable at around 50 percent humidity, an aeroplane's cabin humidity can be as low as 10 per cent. That is drier than being in a desert. Naturally, this extreme dryness will only lead to only one inevitable conclusion: a very dehydrated traveller. According to NHS, the symptoms of dehydration include 'dizziness or light-headedness, headache, tiredness, dry mouth, lips and eyes, and the passing of small amounts of urine infrequently.' Dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina and dry sinuses, nostrils and throat that make you far more prone to infection. Combat all of this by drinking plenty of water and keeping away from beverages with diuretic properties, like alcohol or coffee. Low humidity in cabin air means that passengers should keep diuretic beverages, like alcohol, to a minimum . Ear pain . Ever wondered exactly why you feel pain in your ears during takeoff and landing? It turns out that the uncomfortable feeling a product of the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure to build up within the ear canal. But it's only when this pressure cannot be released, such as due to blockage from a cold, for example, that the passenger will really be made aware of the change. Luckily, alleviating the pressure in most cases is relatively easy - simply by swallowing, chewing or yawning. Additionally, the motion sickness that you may feel in the pit of your stomach actually also starts in your inner ears, when your balance is thrown off by something like turbulence. Ear pain during take off and landing is due to the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure . In this instance, the best bet for preventing nausea is to book a seat over the wings, which is the steadiest part of the plane. And the final ear-related concern to contend with on board has to do with hearing. Whether watching a movie or listening to your iPod, the sounds you're blasting to block out engine noise and passenger chatter are probably wreaking a bit of havoc, since it's a different listening environment than you're used to with different levels of ambient noise to tune out. Although your hearing won't suffer any permanent damage after a plane ride or two, frequent fliers should take note of the decibel difference to avoid any sort of long-term effects. Lower levels of oxygen in the plane's pressurised air can cause light-headedness and shallow breathing . Oxygen deprivation . It may be a small difference, but the lower oxygen levels in the plane's pressurised air can lead to minor oxygen deprivation in travellers. This could cause light-headedness, shallow breathing or difficulty concentrating. If this happens to you, be sure to alert a flight attendant, as he or she may be able to provide you with additional oxygen or even increase the overall airflow to the plane. The lower pressure in the cabin can also affect your blood circulation, which could lead to swelling in your lower extremities - especially on long haul flights when you're cramped in your seat. Ideally, walk around the aircraft every 30 minutes, or, at the very least, flex and stretch your feet regularly. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when blood clots develop in the legs due to long periods of inactivity . DVT . Deep vein thrombosis (or DVT) occurs when blood clots develop within the deep veins of the legs, causing pain and swelling. Occasionally, it may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism, which is when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs. Anyone sitting for more than four hours, as most people do during long-haul flights, is at risk of developing DVT, however, certain groups may be at greater risk. Virgin Atlantic encourages anyone aged 40 or over, anyone with a family history of blood clothes or anyone being treated for cancer, heart failure or circulation problems to be especially cautious. To help prevent clots, moving around during the flight and wearing support stockings will both help to keep blood circulating. However, if you begin to feel short of breath, experience chest pain, or if your legs are still swollen after the flight, you should seek medical attention immediately. On long-haul flights, your exposure to radiation from cosmic rays, energetic particles from space, is higher . Radiation exposure . While on international flights, you're exposed to more than a tiny amount of radiation from cosmic rays, which are energetic particles from space, mostly made up of protons. The longer the flight and the higher and closer the plane flies to the North Pole, the greater the dose of radiation that crew and passengers alike will experience. While it's of most concern for those who fly for a living, frequent flier passengers will experience more of this exposure than people who spend more time on the ground. Several studies have found also that cancer rates among flight personnel are marginally higher than the rest of the general population, although a recent Center for Disease Control (CDC) report did not find further support of such a claim. However, the CDC does admit that experts are still not sure of the health risks associated with cosmic radiation and because you cannot see or feel it, often people do not just precisely when they are being exposed. Flying roundtrip from New York to Los Angeles, for example, three times per year, would expose passengers to the equivalent of 3 chest X-rays, or about 100 microSieverts. On a roundtrip flight from New York to Beijing, however, you can easily exceed that amount. Sun damage from UV rays . It is not something passengers would necessarily think to do before a flight, but applying suncream could well protect against UV damage in the skies. 'At high altitude, over 54 per cent of UVA rays penetrate glass, making pilots spending long periods in the cockpit up to twice as likely to develop melanoma,' Abi Cleeve, MD at UltraSun UK tells MailOnline Travel. 'In fact, 56.6 minutes in the air is equivalent to 20 minutes on a tanning bed.' When flying, a passenger is 100 times more at risk to catch a common cold than when not on a plane . Common cold . Finally, and what may seem insignificant in comparison to the other risks that befall frequent travellers, those who travel often may be at a greater risk for catching a common cold. A 2004 study in the Journal of Environmental Health Research found that when you're flying, your risk for catching a cold is over 100 times higher than when you're not on a plane. Take proper precautions and be sure to wash your hands frequently, and carry anti-bacterial hand sanitiser, when globe trotting. After all, the last thing you want is for a simple cold to slow you down on your next glamorous getaway.","When it comes to flying, there are plenty of health concerns to look out for .
Due to the lack of cabin air humidity, dehydration and swelling are common .
Cosmic radiation is also higher when in flight and closer to the North Pole ."
"A 13-year-old boy, whose mystery illness bound him to a wheelchair with a feeding tube, has made a miraculous recovery after years of suffering thanks to his determined mother who scoured the internet for answers as to why he was in excruciating pain. According to the Today show, Bobby Leithauser, from Marco Island, Florida, was originally diagnosed with dysautonomia, a malfunction in the autonomic nervous system, and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a tissue disorder - but the conditions didn't account for all of his ailments, which included stomach afflictions, loss of vision and agonizing neck pain. Refusing to accept her son’s initial diagnosis, Bobby's mom, Keri Leithauser, began researching his symptoms online, and came across the work of Dr. Harold Rekate, a neurosurgeon at the Cohen Children's Medical Center in New York, who soon discovered her son had a Chiari malformation, a treatable, yet rare condition that affects the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance. Scroll down for video . Miraculous discovery: Bobby Leithauser, 13, suffered from a painful mystery illness for years before being diagnosed with a Chiari malformation, a rare condition that affects the part of the brain that controls balance . Needing a cure: Bobby's parents, Keri and Tom Keri Leithauser, explained that their son started having crippling stomach pain when he was only nine-years-old, requiring him to have a feeding tube . Last December, Dr Rekate operated on Bobby, performing a surgery that he had invented, to fix the condition which cause his spine to press into his brain. Three months later, Bobby recalled the days after his surgery, saying he 'couldn't believe' his unbearable pain was gone after years of suffering. The teen's health problems seemingly came out of nowhere when he was only nine years old, when the once-active child began to experience crippling stomach pain, prompting his parents to start limiting his food to the point that he was only consuming blueberries and chicken. But despite their best efforts, his ailments continued. Next came headaches, tremors and an inability to control his body temperature or regulate his blood pressure. But even after Bobby was diagnosed with dysautonomia and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, his physical suffering continued. Difficult prognosis: Bobby, who was active as a boy, found himself bound to a wheelchair after his condition worsened . 'It was really horrendous pain and I couldn't hold my head up for more than 10 minutes at a time,' Bobby explained. As his condition worsened, his worried mom began doing research on the internet and contacted other parents whose children had similar issues. Chiari malformations are caused by structural defects in the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include dizziness, muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems, headaches and problems with balance and coordination. Chiari malformations mostly occur during fetal development, although they may develop later in life after injury, infection or exposure to toxic substances . It was once believed that Chiari malformations occurred in only one in every 1,000 births, but research shows that they appear to be more common. Babies who are born with Chiari malformations don't develop symptoms until adolescence or adulthood - if they develop them at all . 'I started putting the pieces of the puzzles together,' she said. Her husband Tom noted that because their son's issues started with severe abdominal pain, they found themselves focused on the wrong area of his body. 'The whole time we were looking at stomach pain, never imagining that the problem could be in another part of his body, like the brain,' he said. Mrs Leithauser's determination to cure her son eventually brought her family to Dr. Rekate. As soon as the neurosurgeon saw scans of the boy's skull and spine, he immediately knew what was wrong. The scan revealed that Bobby's skull and spine were not held together properly because the ligaments were too loose. The misalignment was causing his brain to be squeezed from the front and the back. 'I knew that he could be helped by surgery,' Dr Rekate said. 'I knew that the chronic pain that he was in, that the inability to exercise could be helped, that we could change his life.' Bobby is now walking again, and his chronic pain and headaches are gone as expected. But what is even more surprising is that the issues associated with his autonomic nervous system suddenly started to get better as well. 'To me, it's a miracle. It really is a miracle,' Mr Leithauser said. Magical surgeon: Dr Harold Rekate explained that Bobby's skull and spine weren't hooked together properly, which caused his spine to push into his brain . Fast recovery: Three months ago, Bobby had surgery to properly align his skull and his spine, which improved all of his ailments and allowed him to start walking again .","Bobby Leithauser, from Marco Island, Florida, started experiencing crippling stomach pain when he was only nine years old .

"Conwoman Juliette D'Souza persuaded vulnerable victims to hand over £5million as she claimed to be a witchdoctor who could heal their loved ones . A bogus witchdoctor believed to be Britain's most prolific conwoman after she stole £5million from vulnerable victims she duped, said she is penniless and unable to pay them back. Juliette D'Souza, 59, was jailed for ten years after she persuaded 11 vulnerable victims to hand over huge 'sacrifice payments' to cure terminal illnesses, help disabilities and for fertility treatment. D'Souza, acting 'out of pure greed', would tell them that their loved-ones 'would die' unless they paid her and spent the cash on designer goods and a celebrity lifestyle in her four flats, a confiscation hearing at Blackfriars Crown Court heard. But she now claims 'she has no assets whatsoever' in order to repay her victims. The fraudster posed as an intermediary to a ‘shaman’  - a mystic with contact with the spirit world - in the Amazon rainforest. She promised her victims that the cash they gave her would be hung from a 'magical tree' deep in the Amazonian rainforest by shamans 'Pa' and 'Oma', according to ancient healing rites. Police say the fake mystic was paid at least £1million in cash but probably made more than £5million from the criminal enterprise. She spent up to £1.5m on flights, antique furniture, Louis Vuitton handbags and rent on multiple flats in Hampstead, as well as a pet monkey later found it one of her homes. Maria Karaiskos, prosecuting, said that nine months after being jailed, D'Souza 'essentially disputes everything, including any benefit arising from the convictions'. She added: 'It is a blanket denial of everything.' The public gallery was packed with D'Souza's victims, including 83-year-old opera singer Sylvia Eaves, who was duped out of more than £256,000 after first employing D'Souza to cure her stomach problems. Solicitor-advocate Piers Kiss-Wilson said: 'Her case would be she has no assets whatsoever effectively.' Prosecutors believe D'Souza is in a position to repay more than £300,000 to her victims - after around £45,000 of jewellery, including Cartier watches and diamonds, were found at one of her four flats. The haul also included a vintage Rolex watch, made during World War Two. D'Souza is believed to have made £5million from her criminal enterprise spending the cash in designer stores . D'Souza (left) was jailed for the maximum 10 years and a search of her flat found an 'evil eye' hanging (right) Investigators also need to establish the value of a riverside bungalow in Suriname, South America, the court heard. D'Souza denies the tropical home belongs to her, despite a north London antique dealer recounting in a statement that she purchased 'wardrobes, dining tables and chests of drawers'  to furnish the house. The conwoman has also accused Hampstead osteopath Keith Bender of stealing the valuable jewellery from her flat, having previously tried to blame the entire fraud on her former friend. Mr Bender was convinced by D'Souza to pay the rent on several of her flats, but forced his way into one of her properties with a group of her victims, where they discovered an abandoned monkey and a voodoo shrine. He later cleared out the flat. But Miss Karaiskos said D'Souza claimed Mr Bender 'had stolen the jewellery'. As well as designer handbags D'Souza spent the cash she conned her victims out of on a pet monkey . 'He was questioned about it...he said he had taken it along with a lot of other property. 'He has still got it and he has given it to the police. That valuation that we have is just under £45,000.' She added: 'As things stand, the defendant is denying all of the benefit figures, including those that are on the indictment.' Piers Kiss-Wilson, D'Souza's solicitor-advocate, said: 'The assets attributed to her are in the region of £280,000... some of those assets are in the hands of the police . Judge Ian Karsten previously jailed D'Souza for 10 years after she was found guilty of 23 fraud charges. He said: 'It is the worst case of confidence fraud that I have ever had to deal with on indeed that I have ever heard of. 'It seems to me that you have wrecked the lives of a number of victims and you have done it out of pure greed.' The conwoman had claimed to have a client list that once included Princess Diana and music mogul Simon Cowell, persuaded wealthy residents of London's upmarket Hampstead to hand over huge sums over a decade. Bags from expensive shops were found at D'Souza's home, but she claims to have no money to repay victims . Voodoo dolls and Chanel bottles were found in D'Souza's flat and she was later jailed for 10 years . Investigators found some victims were so deeply ‘under her spell’ they agreed to sell their homes and borrow huge sums. One mother of a 10-year-old boy with Down's syndrome was conned out of £42,000 by D'Souza in 2004 after the fake healer claimed the cash would cure his behavioural problems. Another woman, the wife of a globe-trotting City high-flyer, who was granted anonymity to protect her family, was duped her into handing over £170,000. She was told by D'Souza the ‘devil’ child would be born deformed, prompting her to terminate it. Retired solicitor Richard Collier-Wright also paid £7,000 to D'Souza to cure his leukaemia. Sunday Times photographer Jocelyn Bain-Hogg began paying cash to D'Souza in late 2004 to help his mother who was having heart surgery, racking up £43,000 in 'sacrifice' payments to D'Souza. D'Souza had 'told him his mother would die if he didn't pay'. A number of victims are thought not to have come forward because of embarrassment at being duped by the conwoman. D'Souza is pictured as a younger woman and was found guilty of 23 counts of fraud at a trial last year . When friends went to one of her four flats in Hampstead, they found they were filled with piles of rubbish and unopened designer bags. In one an 'Evil Eye' symbol hung on the wall, burned photographs buried face down in earth, freezers filled with rotting meat and a brand new barrister's wig. There were also diaries suggesting that her Hampstead victims were just one of several groups she was scamming . D'Souza, of Hampstead, north London, was convicted of 23 counts of fraud and obtaining property by deception.

"NSW Police have launched an investigation into four of the country's most notorious serial killers in an effort to determine whether the men were responsible for more unsolved murders. The cold case review focuses on backpack murderer Ivan Milat, who was convicted of seven murder, along with Bandali Debs, Ashley Coulston, and Reginald Arthurell and other known mass murderers. Dozens of unsolved deaths are being re-opened and examined for links to the men by a review team from the NSW Unsolved Homicide Squad, a move which Inspector John Lehmann said was motivated by a desire for justice. The cold case review focuses on backpack murderer Ivan Milat, who was convicted of seven murders . 'Even though some of the murders are old, sometimes 30 years ago, and the killers are locked away it doesn't mean we should give up,' Inspector Lehmann told The Daily Telegraph. 'It's about getting justice for the dead and for their families.' The Unsolved Homicide Squad is currently investigating more than 600 unsolved murders which date back to 1965. While official links between any of the known killers and their potential victims are yet to be made, Inspector Lehmann said he was hopeful that the task force would be able to build up enough evidence to charge the murderers. Inspector Lehmann said that while the review was 'routine', the approach was different, and made all the more unusual as a result of the reputation of the killers. Ivan Milat is considered by many to be Australia's most notorious serial killer, responsible for the murders of seven backpackers whose bodies were discovered in the Bengalo State Forest in NSW. Milat is currently serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders, including those of British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters, who were discovered in September 1992 after being reported missing in April.

Their bodies were discovered in the Bengalo State Forest in NSW in 1992 . British backpackers Caroline Clarke (above, left) and Joanne Walters, who were discovered in September 1992 after being reported missing in April . Clarke has been shot ten times in the head and Walters had been stabbed 35 times, and the bodies of his other victims, most of whom were foreign backpackers, also died of stab or gunshot wounds. Bandali Michael Debs is currently serving four consecutive life sentences for the murder of teenager Kristy Harty in 1997, prostitute Donna Ann Hicks in 1995, and police officers Sgt Gary Silk and Sen-Constable Rod Miller in 1998. The judge presiding over the case called the murder of the teenager as 'entirely senseless, needless and wanton.' 'This was, most clearly, a callous, craven and senseless murder in cold blood of an entirely innocent, defenceless and vulnerable young woman. The evidence leads to the inevitable conclusion that you murdered Kristy Harty for no other reason than for the sheer sake of it.' 'You are an evil, violent and dangerous man, who places no value on the life of another,' Justice Kaye said of the killings of Sgt Silk and Sen-Constable Miller. Ashley Coulston (left) is currently serving three consecutive sentences, and Reginald Arthurell (right) is a suspect in the unsolved murder of 82-year-old Catherine Mary Page . Bandali Michael Debs is currently serving four consecutive life sentences for the murder of a teenager, a prostitute, and two police officers . Bandali Debs was charged with the murder of prostitute Donna Ann Hicks (above) in 1995 . Debs is currently in the Goulburn Supermax Jail, along with fellow inmate Milat, who is suspected of killing more people than he is convicted of. Ashley Coulston is currently serving three consecutive sentences for the 1992 murders pf housemates Kerryn Hestridge, 22, Anne Smerdon, 22, and Peter Dempsey, 27. In July of 1992, Coulston responded to an ad placed by the housemates for a new tenant, and shot them in the back of the head execution style while they were hogtied in separate rooms of the house. Coulston is also a suspect in the Balaclava Killer case, where Queensland victims were raped and killed over a ten month time frame between 1979 and 1980. Reginald Arthurell is a suspect in the unsolved murder of 82-year-old Catherine Mary Page, has pleaded guilty to manslaughter for the stabbing death of sailor Ross Browning, his ex-step father Thomas Thornton, and was found guilty of the murder of his fiancee Venet Raylee Mulhall. 'The team will look at what we have in ways of linking these murderers to a victim and then hopefully build up enough evidence to form a strike team and eventually charge them,' Inspector Lehmann told The Daily Telegraph.

"Children were reported for crimes including vandalism, arson, actual body harm and racial or religious harassment to Cambridgeshire police . A girl aged just two has been reported to police for shoplifting and a boy of five accused of rape, a force has revealed. Other 'crimes' by children reported to Cambridgeshire police last year include vandalism, arson, actual bodily harm and racial or religious harassment. One four year-old boy was reported for sexual activity with a young female relative and five six year-olds, including one girl, were reported for assault and sexual assault. A nine year-old was reported for affray, a six year-old girl for common assault and battery and another for a racist assault and several were accused of theft and sex attacks. A five year-old girl was accused of criminal damage and another was reported for criminal damage to a home. The figures released under the Freedom of Information Act showed a massive increase in under-10s being reported to officers in 2014. A MailOnline investigation in January previously revealed that 5,665 crimes were committed by children under eight in the last four years. It also showed that, alarmingly, crimes reached a four-year high in 2014, with 1,713 recorded. Dany DuBois, a counsellor and psychotherapist who deals with child related issues, said children under 10 have no moral compass. He said a child of two has no concept of right and wrong - and should not be reported to police for 'theft'. She said: 'The general opinion of psychologists is that a child below the age of 10-12 does not have a full moral understanding of right and wrong. 'A two year-old will pick up lots of things that attracts them but they would have no concept that is stealing and there are more appropriate ways of dealing with that rather than going to the police. 'But if say a child of five is doing something that may look like rape then they may be copying behaviour they have seen and could be being abused and in that case going to the authorities is the best thing to do but maybe not the police but instead a social worker.' A girl aged just two has been reported to police for shoplifting and a boy of five accused of rape, Cambridgeshire police have revealed in figures . A spokesman for Cambridgeshire police said: 'In most cases, we do not believe custody is a place for children because there are more effective methods which actually reduce the chances of re-offending. 'Restorative justice, which is often used when dealing young first-time offenders, gives an officer the opportunity to resolve a situation successfully, with the approval of the victim, without arresting and criminalising the person responsible. 'The process gives victims the chance to tell offenders the real impact of their crime, to get answers to questions and an apology, while offenders are given the chance to take responsibility for what they've done and make amends but not acquire the stigma of a criminal record.' The spokesman added: 'Custody staff and duty managers are urged to carefully consider whether children need to be kept in custody overnight. 'A new under-15s category has been added to force statistics to give leaders greater visibility of detainees who are most vulnerable by virtue of their age. 'In addition, the Cambridgeshire Police and Crime Commissioner's independent custody visitors, who sit on the force's custody steering group, pay regular visits to custody units across the force to check on the welfare of detainees, including vulnerable people such as children.'","Crimes by children to Cambridgeshire police include vandalism and arson .

"The first wife of Professor Stephen Hawking has said the Government needs a 'big overhaul' of its policy towards disabled people and has also called for a 'stronger tax policy' to enable more funding. Jane Hawking said money from 'firms who make millions in this country and yet do not pay any tax' should go towards those who need it. But speaking at a Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) reception at Buckingham Palace, Ms Hawking said she is not optimistic that anything will change. Scroll down for video . Newlyweds Sophie Hunter and Benedict Cumberbatch joined the Princess Royal for a Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) reception at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday . She was joined at the event - hosted by the Princess Royal - by Prof Hawking, Benedict Cumberbatch and his pregnant wife Sophie Hunter, Michael Ball, Victoria Wood, Greg Davies, Jon Lee from S Club 7, and the presenters from Good Morning Britain. Prof Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease (MND) in 1964 at the age of 22 and given just a few years to live. Now aged 73 and despite his illness leaving him almost completely paralysed, he is celebrated as one of the most brilliant scientists of the modern age. Professor Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease (MND) in 1964 at the age of 22 and given just a few years to live . Now aged 73 and despite his illness leaving him almost completely paralysed, he is celebrated as one of the most brilliant scientists of the modern age . Speaking at the event first wife of Professor Stephen Hawking has said the Government needs a 'big overhaul' of its policy towards disabled people and has also called for a 'stronger tax policy' to enable more funding . Ms Hawking said: 'The Motor Neurone Disease Association is doing very valuable work, and my first husband Stephen Hawking is the patients' patron, and so we're here to support him as well as to support the Association.' Asked if enough is being done to support patients with the disease and what needs to change, she said: 'I think they're doing very well considering that there's very little support for disabled people and their families from the Government. 'I think the Government needs to do a big overhaul of its policy towards disabled people, towards people with degenerative illnesses and it needs to provide much better support and it needs to have a system for vetting carers who go into people's homes.' Asked if she sees that changing, Ms Hawking, who is played by Felicity Jones in The Theory of Everything, said: 'No, not at the moment, but I do think that a stronger tax policy, taxing firms who make millions in this country and yet do not pay any tax...the money should go towards this very particular cause.' Ms Hawking said she does not think the result of the general election will change anything either. The Theory of Everything is based on the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, which was written by Ms Hawking. It looks back to their days as Cambridge students in the early 1960s, when the then-cosmology undergraduate was first diagnosed with motor neurone disease, which went on to rob him of most physical movements. Cumberbatch played Professor Hawking in 2003 BBC drama 'Hawking' and has been a patron of the MNDA charity for 11 years . Reflecting on how she has been thrust into the limelight following the success of the film - for which Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for playing Prof Hawking - she said: 'It's been very exciting and it's a once in a lifetime opportunity so I think I can cope with it. It has meant that life has been very, very busy, very full, not a moment to spare.' Asked if she had any concerns about the film being made, she said: 'Of course I did, but I would not allow the film to go ahead. Each time Anthony McCarten, the producer, came to see me from 2004 onwards I said no every year. No, no, no. 'Until in 2013 he said well we've got an invitation to go to Working Title, the best British film company, so I said right we go. And I was so impressed with the sensitivity that they were bringing to bear on the project that I said yes we'll go ahead. 'Previously the time wasn't right for the family, for Stephen, for me, but then the time was right.' And how did she feel the first time she watched the film? 'Overwhelmed. It was beautiful,' she said. Other guests at the event included Victoria Wood (far left) and Michael Ball . Ms Hawking greeted her ex-husband in the Palace's white drawing room where the 41 guests, including the Princess Royal, mingled before dinner. Cumberbatch, who played Prof Hawking in a 2004 BBC drama, went over to the famous scientist and bent down to speak with him, as well as posing for photographs. The Sherlock star, dressed in a velvet jacket, greeted Victoria Wood with two kisses and chatted with Michael Ball. He stayed close to the side of new wife Hunter for most of the event and also put his arm around her. In 2014 Cumberbatch took part in six ice bucket challenges to help raise money . The actor said: 'I'm very proud to still be involved - alongside Stephen - with the MND Association today,' Hunter was wearing a full-length navy gown - complete with patterned top and feather embellishment - which skimmed over her visible baby bump. Cumberbatch has been a patron of MNDA for 11 years. He said he first became aware of MND back in 2003 when he played Prof Hawking in the BBC's Hawking, and as part of his research into 'this brilliant man' he worked with the charity which introduced him to two people who had MND at different stages. 'I'm very proud to still be involved - alongside Stephen - with the MND Association today,' he said.","Professor Hawking's first wife Jane Hawking was also in attendance and made a plea for a 'big overhaul' of government policy .

"Reddit use 'loserfame' has won eternal online bragging rights after posting a series of photos taken in 2012 when he and two friends snuck into the empty Houston Astrodome and gave themselves a beer-fueled tour. The Houston Astros vacated the stadium in 2003, and it had sat empty for years before the anonymous trio snuck through a fence onto the property. That same year the Houston Chronicle would send a photographer of their own to profile the ruins during daylight hours, and sober. Reddit use 'loserfame' posted a series of photos taken in 2012 when he and two friends snuck into the empty Houston Astrodome . The group could be charged with trespassing but say they meant no harm . A ladder found in what appeared to be a closet let the group even go up onto the roof . Deadspin notes that one of the red beer cups they left behind can even be seen in the Chronicle's photographs of the control room. 'After making it in through a gap in the fence, we were stunned to find out that [where] we snuck in on led straight onto the field,' said read one caption. 'It's kind of hard to tell, but you can see that all of the lights were on in the main hallways which we thought was strange, but definitely helped us explore!' The Houston Chronicle reports that upon finding a ladder they were able to go all the way up to the roof. The stadium has been abandoned since the Atros left in 2003 . Images show the ruins and cobwebs inside the long abandoned stadium . The Astrodome has since been cleaned up with many seats sold and removed . The lucky group even left a red beer cup behind later photographed by the Houston Chronicle . The stadium is still standing as no one seems sure what to do with it . One unidentified man wrote on the captions they had no ill-intent . The Astrodome is now locked up tighter and harder to break into . He wrote: 'It went up about 15ft to a hatch that wasn't locked. So we popped our head out and there was the roof. To the Astrodome. It was surreal.' County judge spokesman Joe Stinebaker told the Chronicle: 'Aside from the inherent danger, the county can, and will, prosecute' people who would break in. One unidentified man wrote on the captions they had no ill-intent. 'We were NOT in there to vandalize, steal, or damage any property. Just there to see how the ol' dome was doing!' he wrote. 'I would NOT recommend and do not condone trespassing on private property. I don't think the building is safe anymore so don't do it!' County judge spokesman Joe Stinebaker said his office would prosecute anyone who broke in . While still empty the stadium has since been cleaned up with many seats removed and sold off. It's also now far harder to break into the place. The Redditor's images capture the eerie decay of the place, including the cobwebbed corners and then-useless equipment. Online reaction hailed the group as heroic for the adventure .

"A woman desperate to become a mother has been refused IVF treatment on the NHS because her partner already has a child from a previous relationship. Now, a furious Charlotte McPhillips, 23, from Rainham in Kent, is taking her case to the European Court of Human Rights in an attempt to force the Government to act. According to Ms McPhillips, she never sees her boyfriend's daughter and insists that having a child is a 'basic human right for a woman'. Charlotte Mcphillips, 23, pictured with partner Robert was told as a teenager she would be unable to conceive naturally because she has polycystic ovary syndrome . 'I hardly have any contact with Eleanor,' she says of partner Robert Howard's four-year-old daughter. 'She lives with her mum and she never stays with us so I don't understand the decision. 'When I was 17 I was told I would get two free goes on the NHS and I wasn't told then that anything would get in the way of that. 'I have already been told that parliament can't do anything and I am willing to go to the European Court to get it. 'It is a basic human right for a woman to have a child and be a mother. Even though I love my stepdaughter, I want a baby of my own.' Ms McPhillips' problems began when she was a teenager and was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome which caused small cysts to grow on her ovaries, preventing her from ovulating. The couple read their letter informing them they cannot have IVF on the NHS as Robert already has a child . Promised IVF by medics at the time, Ms McPhillips thought nothing more of it until, three years after meeting Mr Howard, 24, she decided she wanted to start a family and requested an appointment. But the couple were left devastated when NHS officials told them they were not eligible for IVF because Robert has a child, four-year-old Eleanor, from a previous relationship. Dr Peter Green, chief officer for the Medway Clinical Commissioning Group, sent a letter telling the couple they weren't eligible. 'The eligibility criteria states that where either partner in a couple has a living son or daughter from their relationship or any previous relationship, funding is not available through any of the CCGs in the NHS across Kent and Medway,' he wrote. 'This is irrespective of the age or place of abode of their son or daughter.' The barmaid said she intends to fight the decision denying her the chance to be a mother . 'It is heart-breaking that I can't have children and it was even more devastating when I was told I couldn't have IVF,' says Ms McPhillips. 'Time is running out because I may not be able to produce eggs in a few years' time so I am more determined than ever to get this sorted.' 'It could mean a bitter double whammy as it means my mum may never be a grandmother. Why am I being penalised for a condition that I have through no fault of my own?' Mr Howard, who recently left his job as a supermarket manager, added: 'I have been with Charlotte for three years and we want a baby together.' They have considered going private but say they are unable to afford the £5,000 fee since Mr Howard is unemployed and Ms McPhillips works as a barmaid. Their local Conservative MP Rehman Chishti is supporting them and has said he will back her battle if she takes it to Europe. Guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) state all women under 40 should have access to free IVF. They should be referred after two years of trying to get pregnant but if they can only have a baby using the treatment they can start immediately. However the guidelines are voluntary and many local NHS trusts impose their own conditions in a bid to cut costs.","Charlotte McPhillips, 23, unable to conceive naturally as she has PCOS .

"Footage has emerged of the moment fallen AFL star Ben Cousins was spotted driving erratically and running through the streets away from police, before he was taken into custody for the third time in two weeks. Cousins can be seen stopping and starting his car with its door flung wide open near a Sikh temple, before he is filmed sprinting away from police officers. He is currently in the emergency department of Armadale Hospital awaiting a mental health assessment and remains in a stable condition. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park.

The priest tried to confront Cousins before he took off again and stopped a few metres ahead to take photos of the temple. 'Again, I tried to talk to him and he started his car,' Mr Singh said. 'I called the police and then I followed him again and he stopped his car in the middle of the road and then some cars almost hit him.' Mr Singh then became alarmed by the behaviour and left it to the police. 'He was not looking stable.'

Cousins, who returned to the AFL with Richmond after the league banned him for one year, saw the latter stages of his career overshadowed by controversy . On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. The premiership star and former West Coast Eagles captain was apprehended at the Campbell Barracks near Perth at 11pm, according to Nine News. He was later assessed in the mental health ward at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital where he was reportedly being held under 'mental health watch'.

Cousins, 36, was arrested last week after allegedly being caught driving recklessly and failing to give a breath test. He is scheduled to face the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8 . The Brownlow Medalist's off-field antics have created headlines for almost a decade, due to well-publicised troubles with drugs and criminal connections. In 2005, Cousins and teammate Michael Gardiner became embroiled in police investigation into a nightclub shooting. The following year he was charged after abandoning his car and running away from police to avoid a booze bus. He entered rehab for 'substance abuse' in 2007, being later being suspended by the AFL for bringing the game into disrepute. Cousins returned to the game with Richmond in 2009, before he retired at the end of the 2010 season.

Now, Mrs Venditti is focused on celebrating her  journey from being a women who aimed to 'turn heads' and a 'vessel' for her unborn children to, finally, a proud mother with curves and pregnancy 'wounds'. 'Isn’t it incredible what the human body can do? Or better yet, what a woman’s body can do? I have had four children, including twins, in the span of five years. Yes, my body did that!,' she writes. The 32-year-old, from Ontario, Canada, adds: 'I am the thirty-something mom now with four kids and I am really proud of that. I am so much more confident with my body than I ever have been before. 'Anytime I start doubting my new curves or war wounds I look around the room and ask myself, how many other people in this room grew two people inside their body at once?' Heavily pregnant: Now, Mrs Venditti (pictured pregnant with her twins) is focused on celebrating her journey from being a women who aimed to 'turn heads' to a proud mother with curves and pregnancy 'wounds' Beaming: 'Isn’t it incredible what the human body can do?

Sunbathing: The 32-year-old, from Ontario, Canada, adds: 'I am the thirty-something mom now with four kids and I am really proud of that. I am so much more confident with my body than I ever have been before' While she has come to terms with her new body, Mrs Venditti - who weighs around 140lbs seven months after her twins Mia and Everly's birth - says she is working to lose her baby weight. However, she told TODAY Parents that she is taking her time to return to her target 120lbs - and is mainly concerned with being 'fit and healthy'. 'I’m not looking to be rail thin,' she told the site. On her blog, Mrs Venditti says she reached her goal weight in college after 'being a little bit on the heavy side' as a child. She admits her sole, 'pretty shallow' purpose back then was to 'turn heads'. 'I was already dating my now-husband Mike, and knew that he would love me whatever size I was, but I still craved walking into a room and having all eyes on me,' writes the designer and artist. Changes: Mrs Venditti, who weighed 190lbs at her heaviest, is pictured holding her newborn twins, Mia and Everly, in hospital (left) and smiling on the sofa after giving birth to them via c-section at 37 weeks (right) Proud mom: Mrs Venditti says she was terrified when she found out she was expecting twins. 'I couldn’t wrap my mind around how enormous I was going to get,' the mother-of-four writes in her widely-read blog post . Adorable: The designer and artist, who lives in Milton, Ontario, is pictured with three of her four children . During her first two pregnancies, Mrs Venditti, who weighed around 125lbs before both, experienced fast and easy deliveries. She gained 50lbs with each of the babies and lost the weight within months. But, she says, she was terrified when she found out she was expecting twins. 'I couldn’t wrap my mind around how enormous I was going to get,' Mrs Venditti writes in her widely-read blog post. 'I was already well known for having huge basketball size bellies whenever I was pregnant, but growing two babies at once??? To be honest, I was kind of freaking out about it.' Mrs Venditti, who lives with her family near Toronto, says her fear was only heightened by the many ultrasounds and blood tests that she was required to undergo, all of which came with multiples. Whenever it got too much for her, she would repeat to herself: 'You are a vessel, you are a vessel'. Mrs Venditti, who weighed 190lbs at her heaviest, gave birth to her twins via cesarean section at 37 weeks. She says she was left with a 'bruised and battered' body, with 'swollen ankles' and scars. She also suffered severe pain in her upper torso from her organs stretching to accommodate Mia and Everly. The pain meant she could not lie down, forcing to her to sleep while sat up for a week. 'I told my husband, I don’t feel like myself,' Mrs Venditti said. 'This adorable cute belly that would distract everyone was gone and you’re left with the remains. I did feel sad, I almost mourned.' However, after reflecting on her body's incredible journey, she eventually came to love it. And if she ever has a moment of insecurity, she reminds herself of her accomplishment of having twins. Difference: The mother-of-four now tries work out each morning in a bid to tone her muscles. She weighs around 140lbs seven months after her twins Mia and Everly's birth - but is taking her time to lose weight .

"A Washington, D.C. news anchor got a real earful during a live broadcast on Monday when an exotic insect got so cozy on his ear that he laid two eggs. Fox 5's Bob Barnard was broadcasting from the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History for a story on Museum Week when a palm-sized African Moon Moth unexpectedly landed on his head. Largely unfazed, Barnard continued with his broadcast. When he was done, he discovered the the exotic bug had left behind a gift. Scroll down for video . Ova the top: Washington Fox 5's Bob Barnard got an earful from an African Moon Moth in a live spot at the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History on Monday when the bug laid two eggs in his ear . Barnard was doing a story on Museum Week in DC when the moth laid eggs in his ear. He had no clue it had happened until after the broadcast . The moth had previously caused Barnard a bit of a tickle, which he at first appeared to believe was a bite. However, the insect zookeeper Barnard was interviewing informed him that African Moon Moths don't have mouths at all and are thus incapable of biting. Their plump, green larvae, the zookeeper explained, do all the eating. The moths then live off the fat stores once they become adults. 'That African Moon Moth on my ear on live TV laid two eggs! (Yuck),' Barnard tweeted Monday. Big and beautiful: The African Moon moth measures around 4 inches across with tail-like structures dangling majestically from its wings. The moth likely laid hundreds more eggs after the two he left behind on Barnard . Perhaps that sensation he thought was biting was actually the moth laying her eggs. Either way, the moth won't be around long enough to see if Barnard helps raise her young. The Moon Moth, unable to eat, lives only a handful of days. She does, however lay hundreds of eggs--just a few at a time--before she dies.",Washington Fox 5's Bob Barnard got an earful from an African Moon Moth in a live spot at the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History on Monday .
"A doctor put a 'Do Not Resuscitate' notice on a great-grandfather without any consultation as she believed it would have caused 'unnecessary distress' to discuss the plan with him. Michael Richardson, 66, a former metal polisher and gardener, died at James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on October 27 2013. He had been ill for several years with the lung condition pulmonary fibrosis. His widow Janet, 66, accused medics of 'playing God with his life' when she discovered the DNR notice had been placed on him without consultation. Michael Richardson, 66, pictured with his wife Janet (right), died at James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on October 27 2013 . Dr Anna Blackburn, a consultant specialising in respiratory medicine at the hospital, said she made the decision when he was admitted on October 24, as attempting to save him would have been 'futile' and 'cruel' In the inquest into his death today, Dr Anna Blackburn, a consultant specialising in respiratory medicine at the hospital, said she made the decision when he was admitted on October 24. She said Mr Richardson, from Great Yarmouth, had little chance of surviving a cardiac arrest and attempting to save him would have been 'futile and cruel'. 'I sat down and thought long and hard about it. 'We had discussed his condition, he cried and he seemed quite upset about how it would affect his wife. 'I felt bringing up resuscitation would be even more distressing for him', she said. Patient confidentiality meant she could not approach Mr Richardson's family without first talking to him. The inquest heard the hospital's policy at the time said it was not necessary to discuss a DNR decision if it would be 'unnecessarily burdensome' for the patient. The hospital's policy was not to discuss such a decision if it would be 'unnecessarily burdensome' for the patient. This was changed in light of a 2014 Court of Appeal ruling and now states patients should be informed of the decision, unless this would cause physical harm. Dr Blackburn added: 'If I was faced with Mr Richardson today, I would have that discussion.' Mrs Richardson challenged the doctor in the inquest, saying: 'My husband had a lot to live for even if it was for another week - I'm sorry your decision was very, very wrong.' Mr Richardson's widow Janet, 66, accused medics at James Paget University Hospital (pictured) of 'playing God with his life' when she discovered the DNR notice had been placed on him without consultation . Yesterday, hospital staff described how they had initially rushed to save Mr Richardson after he suffered a cardiac arrest. But they stopped when the DNR notice was brought to their attention. Giving evidence, Mrs Richardson said her husband tried to discharge himself the day before his death. 'He said, ""I can't breathe, take me home - I can't stand it any more. They're trying to kill me"",' she added. 'I said, ""I love you"", and then he said he loved me too. That was the last time I saw him alive. 'I wish I'd bundled him up and taken him home because at least if he was going to die, he was going to die with some dignity.'

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State have released horrific images of an alleged thief having his hand hacked off in its latest warped display of justice. The photographs show two masked 'surgeons' unpacking a briefcase containing meat cleavers, bandages and a chopping board  in front of a baying crowd of onlookers. A suspect,  reportedly convicted of stealing a motorbike after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court, is then frogmarched to a table where his right hand is doused in some form of sterilizing fluid. His hand is then held down on a chopping board while a militant lops it off with a cleaver. Warped justice: Two Islamic State 'surgeons' unpack a briefcase containing meat cleavers, a chopping board and some form of sterilizing fluid before chopping the hand off a thief accused of stealing a motorbike . The alleged thief's right hand is doused in sterilizing fluid to help prevent infection after the amputation . Barbaric: The thief's hand in hacked off with a meat cleaver while being held down on a chopping board . Before the sentencing, the images show crowds of onlookers, including young children, surrounding the table while a fighter appears to read out the charges. It is latest in a string of sickening amputations carried out by ISIS in Iraq and Syria in recent weeks. The photographs, like previous one, were shared by pro-ISIS social media users, who use the Arabic file sharing website Nasher to exchange images of the terror group's latest atrocities. The images are high quality  and carry the distinctive yellow branding of the group's Al-Hayat Media Center, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video. It comes just days after photographs taken in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul showed in gruesome detail how the terrorists pump their victims full of drugs before using a massive meat cleaver to cut off the hands. Last month, Islamic State released a document on social media, explaining the rules of Islamic State penal code, which is being brutally enforced across ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq. Entitled 'Clarification [regarding] the Hudud', the document contains a list of the punishments handed out for crimes committed in the Islamic State, in accordance with the extremist group's radical interpretation of Shariah law. All punishments are carried out after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court. After the sentencing, the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city. Sick spectacle: A baying crowd of onlookers gather round after being encouraged to watch the amputation . Iron rule: Heavily armed militants monitor the crowds which include children as young a five years old . A militant holds what appears to be a charge sheet which is read out before the sentence is carried out . Men and young boys of all ages are actively encouraged to gather and watch the punishments. An Islamic State fighter then reads out the charges found against the victim before the punishment is carried out in public. All forms of blasphemy against Islam are punished by execution, even if the accuser chooses to repent of their sins. Likewise, committing murder, spying, apostasy or sodomy is punished by immediate death. Anyone found guilty of banditry, specifically murder and stealing, is put to death by crucifixion. According to Islamic State's reading of Shariah law, thieves have a hand cut off. It is unclear whether the victim can choose which hand is removed. Islamic State's penal code also states that anyone found guilty of banditry and caught stealing will have their right hand and their left leg amputated. This terrible punishment is done so that every member of the public can identify the victim's past crime. Flogging is another common punishment carried out under Islamic State. Getting ready: In a previous amputation, the men's arms are pumped full of drugs and wrapped in tight bandages both to lessen the agony  and to reduce the amount of blood flowing from the open wound . Agony: After having his hand hacked off, the victim is seen receiving medical treatment to ensure the wound does not become infected . Sick: The victim is seen pinned in a chair by a group of men, one of whom uses a chord to pull his arm taut while two others place a heavy meat cleaver on the top of his wrist, ready to strike .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Meet Coronation Street's latest fresh-faced cast members who are all fighting for the same role. Erin, Eilah and Elsie, are triplets who all play 13-year-old Faye Windass's baby girl Miley, taking it in turns in front of the camera. They were chosen after the soap put out a call to casting agents and put up posters in hospital maternity units in the region asking for identical twin girls to play the newborn. Scroll down for video . Triplets Erin, Eliah and Elsie have joined Coronation Street as the youngest cast members taking it in turns to play the daughter of Faye Windass. Pictured here with father Martyn Halliwell and mother Laura Slinger . The five-month-old triplets were selected after parents Martyn Halliwell and Laura Slinger, from Padiham, near Burnley, put them forward after hearing that triplets are often in high demand in television. Martyn said: 'My cousin, who is a theatre actor, suggested that we should get in touch with an agent. He said ""there is a high demand for twins, let alone triplets"". 'We sent some photos over and within two hours we heard back to say they had a client who was interested. On the Monday we were at Coronation Street.' Martyn, 29, a  sales manager, and  Laura, 26, a beautician, are delighted at how well the girls, born on October 27, have taken to being on the soap. And the family has received a warm welcome from all the cast and crew - particularly from Ellie Leach, who plays teen mum Faye in the controversial storyline, and her mum Anna, played by Debbie Rush. Martyn says that despite only being a few months old his baby daughters are already developing quite a talent when it comes to being on screen. The triplets are swapped each scene while playing the daughter of Faye in the controversial story line that saw the Corrie character give birth at just 13-years-old . 'Everybody is shocked at how good they are,' he said. 'One of the triplets cries on cue, so when they need a crying baby we take Elsie down for filming. When they need a calm baby we take Erin. 'Everybody wants to look at the girls and they make a fuss of them, especially Debbie and Ellie. Ellie has been fantastic with the girls.' The triplets, who have a six-year-old  brother Maddox, were born ten weeks early at Liverpool Women's Hospital. Erin arrived first at 5pm weighing 2lb 2oz, followed by Eilah at 5.01pm weighing in at 3lb 1oz and Elsie, a minute later weighing 2lb. Martyn added that he hopes that their early start on show might have given them the acting bug. 'Hopefully they will stay on the show if they are enjoying it. 'I have grown up watching Coronation Street and so has Laura. They have made us at home and comfortable and everybody is one big family.' The triplets will make their first appearance on Good Friday when a shocked Faye goes into premature labour.","Five-month-old triplets take it in turns to play Miley Windass in the soap .

"As a child, she grew up  feeling she was nobody's child. At just four years old, Jessica Stoate lost her father. Then, ten years later,  her mother died of cancer. It was at that moment, devastated at the loss of both parents when she was just 14 years old, that Jessica vowed to help others. 'I made a promise that no other little girl will ever have to lose what I lost, or live how I have lived,' she told MailOnline. And today, on Mother's Day, the 23-year-old from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey is fulfilling her promise. Scroll down for video . Jessica Stoate was four years old when her father, Richard, pictured, died from a heart defect . Ten years later in June 2006, her mother Samantha died after a five-year battle with cancer . She is embarking on a campaign to raise money and awareness for the blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan. Recalling the moment she realised her mother had passed away, Jessica said: 'I just remember saying, ""I hadn't finished watching the sun go down with you"".' And on losing her father she added: 'I could never describe what it's like to hear that it's the end, when those words are coming from the other half of your heartbeat.' Growing up, Jessica kept her tragic past a secret from  friends, eager that no one treat her differently. But to mark Mother's Day she has found her voice, singing for the first time in public since losing her parents to kickstart her campaign. 'I'm finally speaking out about my story as part of a promise I made to my parents - to do anything I could think of to make sure that as many mums and dads as possible could survive cancer, to be around to watch their children grow up,' she said. 'No one should grow up feeling, as I did, like they're nobody's child. Anthony Nolan is a charity that can stop that happening to other families.' Explaining why she kept her secret for years, Jessica added: 'I never wanted to be defined by what I'd lost. ‘Mothers’ Day was coming up and I was really miserable, I was missing my mum and struggling with my degree. I began to wonder what a difference I could make if I finally told my story.’ It was at that moment, devastated at the loss of both parents when she was just 14 years old, that Jessica vowed to help others. 'I made a promise that no other little girl will ever have to lose what I lost, or live how I have lived,' she told MailOnline . Today, the 23-year-old is fulfilling her promise and embarking on a fundraising campaign for the blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan. Jessica, pictured with her boyfriend Tristan, is running the London Marathon . She decided to make a video of her singing, to tell her story and promote the Jessica's Promise campaign. 'It was a really big thing for me to sing as it was something so special between my mum and me,' she said. 'Whenever things got tough or stressful we went for a drive with the roof down and sang. It took years to get to that point of being able to sing again, it always reminded me of what I'd lost.' She added: 'I'm hoping to show people that we are not defined by our darkest moments. 'I can't change how my story ended, but by running 26.2 miles and helping Anthony Nolan save the lives of people with blood cancer, I hope I can be a part of somebody else's happy ending.' Five years after Jessica's father, Richard, died from a heart defect, her mother Samantha was diagnosed with breast cancer. 'When she had cancer, she just sat me down and said, ""OK, I've got cancer, but we are going to fight this together"", and that was all she said,' Jessica said. 'She was such a strong woman, she kept everything so normal. 'I was so young I couldn't understand the gravity of it. When she lost her hair, she took me to pick a wig for her. 'She made it all so normal and the cancer became just another part of our everyday life.' Growing up, Jessica refrained from sharing her past with friends, eager that no one treat her differently . Five years after Jessica's father, Richard, died from a heart defect, her mother Samantha was diagnosed with breast cancer. After treatment, her mother's disease went into remission, but it returned when Jessica was 13 . Samantha went into remission, but around four years later, when her daughter was 13, the disease returned. And this time it spread. 'I had been away on a Duke of Edinburgh weekend and everyone's mum and dad came to pick them up,' Jessica recalled. 'But my mum didn't. I thought she would be well enough to do it, but when I got home and she opened the door I saw she had deteriorated so much over the weekend. 'I realised then that it wasn't going to be OK.' A few weeks later Samantha was rushed to hospital and later passed away at home. It was June 2006 and Jessica was 14 years old. It was also the 10th anniversary of the death of her father, Richard. Until the age of 16, Jessica lived with her aunt and completed school. Recently she graduated from Surrey University with a first class degree in psychology. After volunteering at last year's London Marathon to cheer in the crowds, Jessica was inspired to take on this year's run. She joked: 'I'm not remotely a runner, I must be insane. 'The last time I ran anywhere was for the bus when I was 14. I missed it.' The 23-year-old chose Anthony Nolan as her charity to support after looking back at her time sitting with her mother in hospital. Jessica chose to support Anthony Nolan after sitting with her mother in hospital as she went through cancer treatment. She said: 'There was nothing I could do. I used to sit on the cancer ward holding her hand, and think about how I could change this ending for other people facing the same future' Jessica added: 'This isn’t the life I would have chosen, and growing up without either of my parents has meant that a part of me will always be missing. But I am the luckiest person in the world for having had two people so exceptional to lose' 'There was nothing I could do,' she told MailOnline. 'I used to sit on the cancer ward holding her hand, and think about how I could change this ending for other people facing the same future. 'Supporting Anthony Nolan became the opportunity to do exactly that - they re-write people's stories everyday by matching selfless strangers with people in desperate need of a transplant, completely changing their destiny. ‘This isn’t the life I would have chosen, and growing up without either of my parents has meant that a part of me will always be missing.

"Bad teacher: Jessica Streeper, 34, a former teacher from Pennsylvania, has pleaded guilty to a felony charge of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a male student . A former middle school math teacher from Pennsylvania has pleaded guilty to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students last year. Jessica Streeper, 34, a married mother of two from Doylestown, entered the plea Monday in Montgomery County Court to a felony charge of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Judge Garrett Page postponed sentencing until the defendant undergoes a sex offender evaluation and the probation office completes a background report. Streeper was a teacher at Eisenhower Science and Technology Leadership Academy in the Norristown Area School District. Prosecutors said in a criminal complaint that an eighth-grade student told them he had sex with Streeper last spring in her car and in her home. The disgraced educator could face a maximum sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison. She is currently out on $10,000 cash bail. Prosecutor Sophia Polites said it would be 'appropriate' to sentence the former educator to prison time, reported the Bucks County Courier Times. ‘Teachers are entrusted with the responsibility of teaching our children, making sure our children are safe,’ said Polites. ‘Teachers are role models. What this teacher did was destroy that trust.’ Wife and mother: The married mom of two admitted last year to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and sexting with him from her phone . Jessica Streeper was arrested in May 2014 after police in Norristown received an anonymous tip informing them that the eighth-grade math teacher was having a tryst with a male student. When the alleged victim, then age 14, was interviewed by detectives, he admitted to having sex with Jessica Streeper on seven occasions, including five times in her car. When investigators checked the teenager's cellphone, they found numerous 'sexts' that were exchanged between the married teacher and her underage lover. According to the criminal complaint, the illicit affairs lasted between April 1 and May 20, 2014. During Monday's court hearing, Judge Page informed the defendant that as a registered sex offender, she will have to report her address and place of employment to state police for the rest of her life.

"Tapping away on a laptop or tablet may be a handy way of recording your thoughts, but there is something satisfying about scribbling away on paper - especially if you're drawing a picture. Now there’s a notebook that allows people to write in it with a pen, then digitise the notes and save them to the cloud, using just a smartphone app. When the Rocketbook is full, users heat the book in a microwave to clean the pages so they can begin to fill them again. Take note! A notebook (pictured) allows people to write in it with a pen, then digitise the notes and save them to the cloud, using just a smartphone app . Joe Lemay, of Cambridge Massachusetts, is raising money on crowd funding site Indiegogo to put the book into production. The notebook and app will work together to enable notes and drawings to be uploaded to the cloud, where they can be stored. The notebook is the size of a traditional sheet of paper and is compatible with any pen, but by using Pilot FriXion pens, notes can be erased by heating the book in a microwave. Organised: There are seven icons on each page, described as the ‘magic buttons’ used to organise notes in the cloud. ‘You assign each icon to the place of your choice, any folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs (illustrated) or your email address,’ the company said, so they can easily be found in the cloud . Write on! When the Rocketbook is full of ideas (pictured), users will be able to heat in a microwave to clean the pages. People will be able to use the accompanying free app to ‘accurately and quickly’ convert handwritten notes and drawings into digital images . Using image capturing technology, the Rocketbook app will be able to ‘accurately and quickly convert’ handwritten notes and drawings into digital images. It will then store written information in predetermined cloud locations using seven icons on the pages. The app will be available for Apple iOS and Android and will come free with any notebook. It will also be able to be used to scan any piece of paper but performance in deciphering the information and storing it may be limited. Instead of the usual lined pages, the sheets in the Rocketbook have a dot grid pattern ‘that allows for true creativity and are great for writing text notes, sketches, and designs,’ according to the firm. There are seven icons at the bottom of each page, described as the ‘magic buttons’ which can be used to organise notes in the cloud. ‘You assign each icon to the place of your choice, any folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs, or your email address,’ the company said. ‘When you mark that icon on your page, Rocketbook automatically files your notes in the right place.’ People will be able to use the accompanying free app to ‘accurately and quickly’ convert handwritten notes and drawings into digital images. Easy: The notebook is the size of a traditional sheet of paper and is compatible with any old pen, but by using Pilot FriXion pens, notes can be erased by heating the book in a microwave . They will hover their handset above a page so the app can use image capturing technology to register words, images and the chosen icon. The app will first be available for iOS devices, with an Android version due in August. It will be able to be used for scanning non-Rocket book pages, but performance may be limited. The book can be pre-ordered via Indiegogo from $25 plus $15 international shipping (£27 for those living in the UK) and each one comes with one black FriXion pen, with others colours on sale too. The firm set out to raise a modest $20,000 on the site, but has so far pulled in $194,982, which is 975 per cent of what it asked for.","People write in the book using a pen and transfer scribblings to the cloud .

"Two more women have come forward to accused Bill Cosby of drugging and raping them in their youth. Margie Shapiro and Sunni Welles both claim they were 17-years-old when, after a night out with Cosby, they woke up and realized they had been sexually assaulted. What's more, Welles was a lifelong family friend of the embattled comedian. Scroll down for videos . Sunni Welles (left) and Margie Shapiro (right) have come forward to claim they were raped by Bill Cosby when they were both 17-years-old . Over 30 women have come forward since last October claiming they were sexually assaulted by Cosby (above), who has repeatedly denied all their claims . The two women detailed their experiences in a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred on Friday afternoon that was covered by The Wrap. Shapiro claims that she and Cosby met in 1975 when she worked at a doughnut shop in Santa Monica that the actor would frequent, and that he invited her to visit him on the set of the film he was working on at the time. From there he invited her to a dinner, but it was cancelled so he took her to the Playboy Mansion. Once there she says the two entered a 'game house' and began playing pinball. She said that she was not drinking at the time, but Cosby said whoever lost the game would have to take a pill, which she admits she agreed to. After losing and taking the pill, she claims she woke up to find that she was naked and Cosby was inside her. She says she passed back out but came to once more and that Cosby was touching her sexually. In the end, he told her she was not dressed well enough to meet Hugh Hefner and she was sent home with a driver. After that, she remembers 'feeling sick' when she saw Cosby's image in her head. Margie Shapiro (in photo at 17 being held up by lawyer Gloria Allred) claims that after meeting Cosby in 1975 at the doughnut shop she worked at, he invited her to visit him on set . Sunni Welles' (left) mother was friends with Cosby in the mid-1960s when she claims he invited her to go to a jazz club, pout something in her drink and then had sex with her . Welles meanwhile had known Cosby for years as her mother worked in Hollywood, first as a theatrical agent and then a story editor, and that as a teenager studying music she was thrilled when Cosby offered to take her to see some jazz back in the mid-1960s. Cosby and her mother had a friendship, so neither mother or daughter thought anything of it, and the experience of seeing live music would be good they thought as Welles was auditioning to be a background singer. Welles, like Shapiro, was not drinking, and ordered a Coke she claims at the club. After she had a sip she says 'things began to become blurry.' The next thing she remembers is waking up in an empty apartment feeling as if she had engaged in sexual intercourse. Cosby was nowhere to be found, so the young woman went home. Now Welles, who called Cosby a 'sexual predator,' is seeing if she might still be able to bring a suit against him. This all comes just days after Chelsea Handler (above with ex Andre Balazs) came forward to reveal that she too believes she might have become one of Cosby's victims . This all comes just days after Chelsea Handler came forward to reveal that she too believes she might have become one of Cosby's victims after he invited her to his hotel room in Atlantic City a few years back. Feeling uncertain, she decided to bring some male friends along with her, and she believes that is why she was not preyed upon by the actor. Over 30 women have come forward since last October claiming they were sexually assaulted by Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all their claims. In the aftermath however he has seen appearances cancelled as well as a Netflix special and a planned NBC series.","Two women have come forward to claim they were raped by Bill Cosby when they were both 17-years-old .
