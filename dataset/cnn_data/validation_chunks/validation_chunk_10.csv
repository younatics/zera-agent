"Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard claims Jose Mourinho won't be bothered by tarnishing his legacy after  Chelsea's latest ill-mannered exit from the Champions League. The Blues crashed out of Europe's elite competition after a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night sent Paris Saint-Germain through to the quarter finals on away goals. The game was marred by regular interruptions for fouls and unsportsmanlike behaviour  while the French media has accused Mourinho of being responsible for the sending off of Zlatan Ibrahimovic as nine Blues players crowded the referee following his foul on Oscar. Steven Gerrard was speaking ahead of an All-Star charity game to be staged at Anfield later this month . Gerrard will pit his team of All-Stars against one managed by Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher . The pair show off their respective teams, featuring the likes of Thierry Henry, John Terry and Luis Suarez . Read John Terry's excuse for Chelsea's bully boy tactics against PSG . However, Gerrard - who came close to signing for Mourinho's Blues in 2005 - believes the Portuguese will not be worried about the legacy he leaves because he is 'a winner'. The Reds captain was speaking ahead of an All-Star charity match at Anfield that will see him line up alongside the likes of Thierry Henry and Luis Suarez against a team managed by  Jamie Carragher which features Didier Drogba and Pepe Reina. 'I think it's normal when you play games at that level. Players and managers want to win so much - players will try every trick in the book to try and get over the line and win football matches,' he told reporters. 'Sometimes it doesn't look nice but we've all been guilty of it throughout our careers by not always abiding by the rules. Jose Mourinho will not be concerned by bully-boy tactics tarnishing his reputation, says Gerrard . Up to nine Chelsea players crowded the referee ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's sending off . Mourinho has words with former Chelsea defender David Luiz (left) from the touchline . 'I think PSG got through because they're the better team and good luck to them going forward. Chelsea had a very good effort, but it wasn't to be for them. 'I don't think he (Mourinho) will be interested in whether it will tarnish his legacy. He's a winner, he's won many, many trophies. Every single player out there has respect for him as a manager, he's going to win many more titles and will probably go down as one of the best managers of all time. 'I'm in no position to criticise him or have a go at him. He does it his way and I respect that. But, I'm only interested in one manager and that's the one that I've got here.'

Branislav Ivanovic rows with Brazilians Thiago Motta and Silva as Chelsea twice lose their lead . Meanwhile, former Liverpool defender and Sportsmail columnist Carragher admitted he was more concerned for the standard of the Premier League than Chelsea's elimination. 'I'm disappointed because our league has lost its best team in the competition. And to see them come up so short on the night to PSG - who looked a class act and credit to them as they have some very good players - but for our league in general,' he said. 'You look at Manchester City and Arsenal's first legs, and hopefully they can come through. Ourselves, Liverpool not qualifying for the knockout stages, so not so much for Chelsea but for our league. You want to see the teams do well and at this moment we're coming up a bit short,' he added.","Chelsea crashed out of the Champions League after a bad tempered clash with PSG on Wednesday .

"Manchester United boosted their Champions League chances with a convincing win over Tottenham, racing into a three-goal lead in the first half before seeing the game out. Michael Carrick bossed the midfield, before Wayne Rooney stole the show with a brilliant goal - and an even better celebration. Sportsmail's Matt Barlow was at Old Trafford to run the rule over both sides... Wayne Rooney celebrates with his 'knockout' celebration as Manchester United take a three-goal lead . Manchester United . DAVID DE GEA: A relaxed spectator from the moment he scrambled across his goal to keep out back-pass from Jones until he saved from Kane in the last minute. 6. ANTONIO VALENCIA: Few problems of a defensive nature after his error against Arsenal and combined well with Mata in attack. 6. CHRIS SMALLING: Few centre halves have coped so well with Kane in recent weeks. Read it well, quick into the tackle and ran the ball out with style once or twice. 7 . David de Gea, who had remarkably little to do until a last-gasp save from Harry Kane, celebrates the win . PHIL JONES: Strong and assured - but for the sloppy back-pass which almost caught out De Gea in opening minutes. 6.5 . DALEY BLIND: Splendid first half, raiding forward from left-back to link up with Ashley Young as United tore Spurs apart before half-time. Good delivery from wide. 7. MICHAEL CARRICK: Took a grip of the game with two instances of clear-minded wit in the first half: a pass for Fellaini’s opener and a goal with his head to make it 2-0. 8.5. JUAN MATA: Like Carrick making his first Premier League start for two months, playing wide on the right where he often struggles to cover the ground. Added some silky touches. 6.5. MIchael Carrick heads the ball back across goal to put United two goals up after some poor Spurs defending . Carrick, who also created United's first goal for Marouane Fellaini, was the best player on the pitch . ANDER HERRERA: Supplied good energy, invention and forward thrust from midfield and a key to success of the formation. 6.5. MAROUANE FELLAINI: Huge first-half contribution. Spurs could not cope with him. One well-taken goal with his left foot and a key header in second. 7.5. ASHLEY YOUNG: Excellent reminder of his acceleration and trickery on the left-wing. Tormented Walker in the first half as United won the game. 7.5. Fellaini celebrates putting United into the lead with a well-placed finish in the ninth minute of the game . WAYNE ROONEY: Mobile and tireless, with wonderful vision to link up with his midfield runners. Scored a fabulous goal and may have had more. 8. Subs: Pereira for Mata (79 min) Premier League debut. Falcao for Fellaini (83). Rafael for Carrick (87) Manager: Louis van Gaal: Having started the season trying to cram as many attackers onto the pitch as possible, this 4-1-4-1 shape had a pleasing balance. 7. Rooney slots away after being handed the ball by lacklustre Nabil Bentaleb in the opening 45 . Louis van Gaal waves to the Manchester United fans after a game where he finally found his team's balance . Tottenham . HUGO LLORIS: Badly exposed by his team in the first-half. Little he could do with any of the goals, but unable to save Spurs this time. 6. KYLE WALKER: Torrid opening 45 minutes when he could not contain the first-half threat of Young and Blind on United’s left. Not helped by his midfield 4. ERIC DIER: Beaten in air by Fellaini for United second. Easily side-stepped by Rooney for the third. Easier after the break when United cruised. 4.5. JAN VERTONGHEN: Perhaps the only one of the defensive unit to escape with a little credit. Even so, not able to keep United at bay. 6. The Spurs defenders look shell-shocked at the half-time whistle after being completely over-run . DANNY ROSE: Not the result or performance he would have wanted in front of England boss Roy Hodgson, but most of the damage done by United on the other side. 5.5. RYAN MASON: Appeared overwhelmed by United’s intensity and the thrust of Fellaini and Herrera. Dragged right to help with Young and Blind, left holes for Fellaini to exploit. 5. NABIL BENTALEB: Like Mason, found it impossible to get any sort of grip on the game in midfield. Awful mistake for the third goal. 5. ANDROS TOWNSEND: A torrid half-hour. He supplied precious little protection for Walker and enjoyed little quality possession to attack. Hooked as Pochettino reshuffled. 4. Andros Townsend was withdrawn in the first half after a torrid first 30 minutes in Manchester . Townsend cannot bear to look as he sits on the Old Trafford bench after being replaced so early on . CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN: Flickers of magic from the Dane were absent. A victim of Tottenham’s inability to secure possession. 5. NACER CHADLI: Poor clearance gave Carrick chance to score the second. Swtiched to the right after Townsend subbed to provide more solidity, which he did. 5.5. HARRY KANE: A difficult afternoon in front of Hodgson. Ran hard as ever but was isolated and starved of the ball and it was the 89th minute before he tested De Gea. 5. Subs: Dembele for Townsend (31) helped make Spurs a little more solid 5; Lamela for Mason (64) minimal influence 4, Adebayor for Chadli (79) out of exile to little effect. Mauricio Pochettino may have made an early chance, but it was already too late for Tottenham on Sunday . Manger: Mauricio Pochettino: His team were stunned by United’s intense start and slow to adjust until he sent on Dembele for Townsend, by when it was too late. 5. Referee: Mark Clattenburg: Back at Old Trafford for Manchester United v Spurs a decade after missing the Pedro Mendes goal which crossed the line. This experience was far less controversial. 7.","Goals from Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini and Wayne Rooney earn win .

"Lewis Hamilton plans to toast his Australian Grand Prix triumph with Hollywood A-Lister Arnold Schwarzenegger in Melbourne. Hamilton issued an emphatic defence of his Formula One world championship with a flawless drive at the Albert Park Circuit in Sunday’s season opener. The 30-year-old Briton left Nico Rosberg chomping on his Mercedes exhaust fumes on the run down to Turn 1 and from then on in the result never appeared in doubt. Lewis Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger share a joke on the podium at the Australian Grand Prix . Hamilton, who stormed to victory ahead of Nico Rosberg, made a joke about Schwarzenegger's height . They ended the interview by saying: 'I'll be back'; Schwarzenegger's catchphrase from the Terminator films . It was the perfect start to Hamilton’s hopes of becoming the first British driver to win back-to-back titles, and join the likes of Ayrton Senna, Niki Lauda and Sir Jackie Stewart with a hat-trick of F1 championships. And a jubilant Hamilton hopes to celebrate his latest victory, the 34th of his grand prix career, with Schwarzenegger who conducted the podium interviews after the race. 'If he is around I will go out for a drink with him,’ said Hamilton. ‘I am not starstruck by many people but I was with him. I am a big fan.' Hamilton provoked much hilarity on the podium when he appeared to be taken by surprise by the appearance of the Terminator star. Hamilton led from start-to-finish ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in Australia . Sir Jackie Stewart runs for cover as Robserg and Hamilton drench the Scotsman with champagne . Hamilton is hopeful of hooking up with Schwarzenegger for a drink to toast his victory later on Sunday . ‘Hey, man! Wow,’ Hamilton said when Schwarzenegger walked on to the podium. ‘It’s an incredible feeling to continue winning, but also great to be up here with you… I thought you were taller!’ Schwarzenegger replied: 'I'm not wearing my high heels.' Moving to clarify his comments about the Austrian's height, Hamilton later said: ‘I don’t know what I said. I hope I didn't offend anyone. ‘It’s not like I said he was short, but I honestly thought he was taller.’ Hamilton and Schwarzenegger ended the interview by both saying 'I'll be back', the catchphrase made famous in the Terminator films.","Arnold Schwarzenegger conducted the post-race podium interviews .

"Twitter has admitted it needs to get tougher on trolls and has already introduced new ways to report abuse to weed out the perpetrators. But now it's taking aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the site. Its rules now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. Twitter's rules have been updated in an attempt to clamp down on revenge porn. Under 'Private information' (pictured) the guidelines now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. The site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users . The changes were spotted by BuzzFeedNews, which recently submitted a Q&A to Reddit when the community site took a similar stance against pornographic posts. Twitter has used these questions to address the changes. Both Twitter's rules and abusive behaviour policy have been updated to reflect these changes. Twitter said that an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent. In February a law was passed that made posting revenge porn images and videos a criminal offence in England and Wales. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland are considering similar laws. Under the rules, revenge porn is considered: 'photographs or films which show people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way or with their genitals exposed, where what is shown would not usually be seen in public'. It covers images shared without the subject's permission and 'with the intent to cause harm. Offenders face up to two years in jail. This follows laws in sixteen US states - including Alaska, California,  New Jersey and Texas - explicitly relating to revenge porn. Under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can, in theory, distribute it as they see fit but  Twitter's rules additionally considers the people in the footage. It will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify  they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission. Twitter said 'agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy', including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders. 'Users who believe that content they post has been incorrectly identified is violating the policy can appeal the decision and agents will review that request as well,' said the firm. 'Content that is identified as violating our policy will be hidden from public view and users posting it will have their accounts locked; those users will be required to delete the content in question before being able to return to the platform. 'Users posting such content with an intent to harass will be subject to suspension from Twitter.' The changes follow reports Twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking  email addresses and phone numbers. This means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details Twitter will be able to intervene. Reports recently claimed Twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. When people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number (pictured). In the future, Twitter may  ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number . Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father's suicide. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games. In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note. Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year. When people sign up to Twitter they are required to provide an email address, which is then validated. Adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive text notifications or setup two-step verification. Under the reported plans, once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and cross-referenced each time a new user signs up to the site. Last month an internal memo sent by Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site 'sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls'. In the memo, Mr Costolo said  he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future. Mr Costolo's comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information. It has also made it simpler to flag tweets and accounts for review . These enhancements similarly improved the reporting process for people who see abuse but aren't directly receiving it. More recently the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features. MailOnline has contacted Twitter for more information about how users details will be stored . Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500. Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls. Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act. Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003. It has also made it simpler to flag tweets and accounts for review. These enhancements similarly improved the reporting process for people who see abuse but aren't directly receiving it. More recently, the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features. Tina Bhatnagar, Twitter's vice president of User Services said: 'Over the last six months, in addition to the product changes, we have overhauled how we review user reports about abuse. 'Overall, we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously, and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports. 'We are also beginning to add several new enforcement actions for use against accounts that violate our rules. These new actions will not be visible to the vast majority of rule-abiding Twitter users - but they give us new options for acting against the accounts that don't follow the rules and serve to discourage behavior that goes against our policies. The safety of our users is extremely important to us. It's something we continue to work hard to improve.' In recent years Twitter has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls.

"Jose Mourinho claims Arsenal are back in the race for the Barclays Premier League title after Chelsea were held 1-1 by Southampton. Arsenal beat West Ham 3-0 on Saturday and Arsene Wenger’s side, who have not won the league since 2004, are now seven points behind Chelsea. Manchester City were beaten at Burnley 1-0 and Chelsea could only draw at Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho has admitted that Arsenal have joined Chelsea and Manchester City in the title race . The Blues struggled to break down Southampton despite Diego Costa's first-half opener at Stamford Bridge . Arsenal saw off the threat of West Ham at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday with an impressive 3-0 win . Mourinho said: ‘Of course Arsenal are in it. They are seven points behind Chelsea, but have one less match to play than Chelsea. ‘Both City and Arsenal are in the title race. It depends on the momentum for Arsenal - the 3-1 defeat against Monaco or the 3-0 defeat against West Ham? ‘So the danger is always there. But I keep saying, we are there. If someone had told me in August that, at the end of March, we'd be six points in front with a match in hand, I'd have signed for that immediately. ‘There are two perspectives. One perspective is a draw at home to Southampton is not a good result. For me, that perspective is very acceptable. ‘The second perspective is we had a lead of five points from second, and now it's six points with one less match to play.’ Mourinho believed a wrongly-awarded penalty denied his side an eight-point lead over Manchester City at the top of the league. The Portuguese coach was fined £25,000 for saying there was a 'clear campaign' against his side after Cesc Fabregas was denied a penalty and booked for diving instead in the December 28 draw at St Mary's. Mourinho says that Arsenal are a danger to Chelsea, although he is happy with his current strong position . On Sunday Mourinho was frustrated Nemanja Matic was penalised - allowing Dusan Tadic to score from the spot and cancel out Diego Costa's first Premier League goal for almost two months - while Branislav Ivanovic was not awarded a spot kick at the other end. 'I'm happy with the situation. I'm happy with the six-point lead, but I'm not happy with the result,' Mourinho said. 'If you remember our two matches against Southampton: in one game, one penalty that is not a penalty and in another game a penalty that was not given. You are speaking about six points transformed into two points.' Mike Dean (right) gave Southampton the penalty for their equaliser, Mourinho said that it 'is not a penalty' Thibaut Courtois could not keep out Dusan Tadic's spot-kick and the playmaker secured a point for Saints . Mourinho was clearly upset with the penalty decisions, but bit his tongue on this occasion. He said: 'My opinion is not important. Important is Mr Mike Dean (the referee). 'His decision was a penalty and his decision was no penalty on Ivanovic.' Ivanovic may have been clipped by Tadic, but fell theatrically, dissuading Dean from pointing to the spot. Nemanja Matic brought down Saido Mane for Southampton's equaliser but Mourinho was clearly upset . Branislav Ivanovic went down in search of a penalty but Dean did not give the desired spot-kick . Asked about the fall, Mourinho deferred to his media officer sitting alongside, saying: 'You have to control me, if not...' Mourinho was told television pundit Graeme Souness - with whom he had a public exchange of views this week after the Scot criticised Chelsea's conduct in the Champions League exit to Paris St Germain - thought Matic had conceded a penalty. 'Graeme Souness says also that it's more a reason to criticise a player who asks for a yellow card than a player who kicks somebody in the chest,' Mourinho added. 'I went to Sky and they told me their pundits said it's a penalty. I went to BBC and they told me it's not a penalty. I went to the radios and they told me it's not a penalty. Mourinho was told television pundit Graeme Souness thought Matic had conceded a penalty, and responded . Mourinho said that pundits 'win every game' due to their position of being critical but exempt from criticism . 'Pundits are paid to wear my suit, but I'm not paid to wear their suit or to comment on their comments. 'If one day I become a pundit, I will wear a manager's suit. I will win every game, because pundits win every game, and then I can be critical and I can be phenomenal like they are.' Matic was replaced by Ramires soon after a second-half foul on Sadio Mane which could have seen him booked for a second time - after his initial yellow when giving away the penalty - and sent off for a second successive Premier League game. 'When that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow card can come,' said Mourinho. Matic was substituted for Ramires in the second half but could have seen a second yellow card for one foul .

"Jenson Button found a glimmer of hope in McLaren's dismal start to the Formula One season when he at least finished Sunday's Australian Grand Prix. The Briton was last of the 11 cars that completed the race, and was twice lapped by race winner Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes, but the 2009 world champion saw some positives. 'Today has been a good day,' he said. 'We're still a long way off, but this is a good starting point -- and I enjoyed the race. I even had a good little battle with Checo (Sergio Perez). McLaren driver Jenson Button finished last at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . Button waves to the crowd ahead of the race. McLaren have endured a difficult start to the season . 'Today also really helps in terms of development. If we'd done three laps, we'd have learned nothing, so we've learned a massive amount by completing a race distance.' Button missed out on a championship point but he said that was almost irrelevant after a weekend when everything went wrong for the sport's second most successful team, who have not won a race since 2012. 'It was also a good opportunity for me to get used to the car and to play around with it, making adjustments in the cockpit,' said the Briton, whose longest stint before Melbourne had been 12 laps. 'There's a lot of work still needed - on power, driveability, downforce and set-up - but we can make big strides. And, by improving one area, it tends to snowball.' McLaren had low expectations after Button and Kevin Magnussen were the slowest qualifiers. Things only got worse on Sunday when the Dane failed to make the grid after his Honda power unit blew up on the way to the grid. Kevin Magnussen is presented to the crowd before the race, but the Dane failed to make the start after his Honda engine blew on the way to the grid . 'Even though I couldn't make the start, the team can learn something from my car's problem,' said Magnussen, who was recalled after Fernando Alonso was ruled out on medical advice following a crash in testing. 'We can take positives from Jenson finishing the race, too - we came here to learn, and that's what we did. Finishing is a small victory for the team - I don't think we expected to be able to do that. ""Now we can get a car to the finish line, we can start to accelerate our learning.' Racing director Eric Boullier also found a silver lining from a dark weekend. 'It's not easy to find positives, but in fact there are some,' he said.

"Southampton stopped Chelsea from going eight points clear at the top of the Premier League after Dusan Tadic cancelled out Diego Costa's opener at Stamford Bridge. Costa opened the scoring on 11 minutes when he headed past Fraser Forster, but when Nemanja Matic brought down Sadio Mane shortly after, the Saints were gifted a way back into the game. Tadic didn't need asking twice as he slotted the ball past Thibaut Courtois, and the scores remained at 1-1. Find out how each player fared at Stamford Bridge with Sportsmail's Neil Ashton.

"West Ham striker Carlton Cole has spoken of his disappointment at being fined £20,000 for a Twitter indiscretion in which he told a Tottenham fan to 'F off you c***'. The 31-year-old, who has 123,000 followers on Twitter, was responding to a message from Spurs supporter Stuart Hardy that read: 'Hi @CarltonCole1 when your own team-mates don't kick the ball out when you're lying injured for 2 mins, you think it's time to call it a day?' Cole accepted the fine from the FA, dished out after the incident that occurred on February 22, but has now spoken out to defend himself. West Ham striker Carlton Cole was fined £20,000 for tweeting a fan saying 'F off you c***' in February . Cole tweeted a Tottenham fan who had insulted him on Twitter, but later deleted the message . Carlton Cole is far from the first footballer to have be censured over his behaviour on Twitter: . Darren Bent, 2009 - £120,000 fine . Bent was fined by his club Tottenham for a blast at chairman Daniel Levy. He tweeted: ‘Do I wanna go Hull City NO. Do I wanna go Stoke NO do I wanna go Sunderland YES so stop f****** around levy.’ Carlton Cole, 2011 - £20,000 fine . Cole tweeted during England's friendly with Ghana saying: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap!' Rio Ferdinand, 2012 - £45,000 fine . Ferdinand appeared to endorse a tweet by another user  which described  Ashley Cole as a 'choc ice', a term said to mean a person is black on the outside but white on the inside. Ashley Cole, 2012 - £90,000 fine . Cole was unimpressed with the FA's judgement in the John Terry racism case, tweeting: 'Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFT***S' Michael Chopra, 2014 - £15,000 fine . Referring to life at crisis club Blackpool, Chopra posted: ‘F****** joke this come in training only 6 f****** players here then find out the fitness coach taken the football session #joke.’ Rio Ferdinand, 2014 - three-match ban and £25,000 fine . QPR defender used the word 'sket' in reference to another Twitter user's mother this season. 'I was disappointed I got done,' the West Ham man told Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday. 'The amount of abuse you get on Twitter is sometimes unruly and you can't defend yourself as a footballer. 'Obviously I know I've got responsibility and I'm a role model and some of the language that gets spouted at you, you can't return it. You've got to be very aware of that and I did make a mistake.' It is not the first time Cole has been caught out by the FA. He was fined £20,000 in April 2011 for a tweet he posted during England's friendly against Ghana that read: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap! 'The only way to get out safely is to wear an England jersey and paint your face w/ the St George's flag!' After his second misdemeanor in February, Cole's total fines for Twitter wrongdoings rose to £40,000, an amount he admits 'hurts'. 'You can't defend yourself,' he continued. 'You're a sitting duck really and you need to try and be able to blank it out of your mind – but some of the stuff they say is too much. 'If you can't handle it you should stay off Twitter or else you're going to be getting fined a lot. 'Forty grand hurts! I try to keep it humorous on Twitter, but sometimes being humorous does get you into trouble.' After his tweet to the Tottenham supporter, the FA's statement, detailing the fine, read: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today, Carlton Cole has been fined £20,000 after he admitted breaching FA Rules in relation to social media.' 'The West Ham United player, who was also severely warned as to his future conduct, admitted posting a comment on his Twitter account which was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, in breach of FA Rule E3.' Cole has been fined £40,000 overall for two separate incidents involving his Twitter conduct .","Carlton Cole was fined £20,000 for a tweet he sent to a Tottenham fan .

"Sir Alex Ferguson has hailed the fantastic career of Dave Mackay as the tributes came in for the former Tottenham and Scotland midfielder, who died on Monday night aged 80. Edinburgh-born Mackay passed away at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. Having joined Tottenham from Hearts in 1959, Mackay went on to achieve a historic league and FA Cup double with the north London club in 1961.

Spurs are set to hold a minute's silence for their former captain, who also helped Derby to success as a player and coach before taking up a similar role with Swindon. Ferguson, who fondly remembers Mackay as a contemporary and a friend, told Sky Sports News: 'I played against him once and I'm glad it was only once! 'He was hard. He was one of the hardest men of all time - a great Scottish player. You think of Denis Law, Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness; Dave Mackay was along with them. 'He came back from two broken legs. He broke it against Manchester United actually, recovered and broke it again. He went on to play for Derby County and won the league and then became the manager, which was not an easy task because he followed Brian Clough, of course. Mackay, then at Derby County, challenges Manchester United's George Best during a game during the 1970s . Best again felt the full force of Mackay's boot as the pair battle for the ball in 1971 . 'But he's had a fantastic career both has player and as manager. I always remember he was a good friend of mine.' Spurs will hold their minute's applause ahead of Wednesday night's game against Swansea at White Hart Lane, with black armbands being worn by the squad and a number of the club's highest-profile former players paying tribute to Mackay at half-time. Current Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino is anticipating an emotional occasion for the evening kick-off, saying: 'It is a great loss for British football. He was a legend for Tottenham and in British football. Sir Alex Ferguson hailed Mackay as fantastic player and manager as well as a good friend . 'A very sad day and I want to send condolences to his family and friends. 'He is a legend, big player and manager, and it is a very sad day. It is emotional yes. Our players know it is important to get the three points.' The Scottish FA announced it will also hold a minute's applause in honour of Mackay before Scotland's friendly against Northern Ireland later this month. The 22-cap Scotland international began his career with Hearts in 1953 and captained the Edinburgh side to the Scottish League title during the 1957-58 season. Mackay (right) rushes to congratulate goalscorer Jimmy Greaves (middle) with Jimmy Robertson in 1967 . 'The Scottish FA is deeply saddened by the news of Dave Mackay's death,' a statement on its website read. 'He was a legendary figure with Heart of Midlothian, Tottenham Hotspur and Derby County; an inspirational pillar for the clubs with whom he played with distinction and, of course, his country. 'Dave played 22 times for Scotland and was instrumental in helping his country qualify for the FIFA World Cup finals in Sweden in 1958. Proving his athleticism by jumping over Spurs team-mates Cliff Jones, Ron Henry and Jimmy Greaves . 'His last international appearance occurred against Northern Ireland in 1965 and the Scottish FA believe it is appropriate that a minute's applause should be observed in his honour prior to the forthcoming match against Michael O'Neill's side at Hampden Park on Wednesday, 25th March.' Arsene Wenger, manager of Tottenham's biggest rivals Arsenal, also spoke about Mackay in his own media briefing ahead of the Gunners' game at QPR. 'He's an iconic figure of English football who contributed a lot to Tottenham's success at the time,' Wenger said.

'The majority of pictures you see of Dave Mackay, he had his chest stuck out. That is how he played and that is how he lived his life,' he told BBC Radio Derby. 'He had a tough legacy taking over as manager from Brian Clough, in terms of the atmosphere at the club, but he calmed and settled everyone down.'","Dave Mackay, the Scottish enforcer of Spurs' 1961 Double winners, died aged 80 on Monday night .

"Rangers full-back Lee Wallace admitted last week that his Scotland career effectively ended when he elected to remain at Ibrox following the club’s descent into administration, liquidation and the Third Division. Before being signed from Hearts by then manager Ally McCoist for £1.5million in the summer of 2011, he had made five appearances for his country. However, his residency in the lower leagues has seen the 27-year-old make just three substitute appearances (totalling a mere 53 minutes) for the national team in the last four years. Wallace claimed that, as he approaches what should be his peak years as a player, he has all but abandoned hope of forcing his way into Gordon Strachan’s starting 11. Rangers goalkeeper Cammy Bell (right) joins Tom Walsh as they promote a new four-match ticket package . Ibrox team-mate Cammy Bell could be forgiven for adopting a similar approach. The goalkeeper’s only cap came against the Faroe Islands in 2010, when he was playing for Kilmarnock. His involvement with Scotland squads, a regular occurrence during his time at Rugby Park, ended when he joined Rangers in 2013. However, the 28-year-old, whose international prospects were further hindered by a shoulder injury sustained in August which ruled him out of action for seven months, is in no mood to close the door on his chances of representing his country just yet. There’s also the small matter of David Marshall, Craig Gordon and Allan McGregor being ahead of him in the pecking order. But Bell insisted: ‘I would never say it’s over. I’m desperate to play and be part of the squad. The goalkeeping situation is very strong and there are some great goalies there. I totally respect that. ‘All I can do is keep playing well at club level and keep knocking on the door and, hopefully, the manager will take notice.’ Of course, as a goalkeeper, Bell can afford to be more sanguine than outfield players. All things being equal, he should still be playing at a high level for another decade or so. That, however, does not mean he isn’t impatient for success. Some former Rangers players, including Barry Ferguson, the 2003 Treble-winning captain, have claimed that another season in the Championship may prove beneficial for the Ibrox club while the first-team squad is dismantled and rebuilt from scratch. Lee Wallace's Scotland career is effectively over . Bell doesn’t see it that way and he wants last Sunday’s unexpected victory over play-off rivals Hibs to be the starting point on the road to Rangers returning to the top flight this year. ‘I can only speak for myself, and I want to be playing in the top league,’ he said. ‘You’ve got to be ambitious as a player and I want to play at the highest level I can with Rangers. ‘I’m desperate to be back in the top league and I’m sure everyone else associated with the club is as well. We know it’s going to be hard but there’s still a great chance we can do it. ‘We need to be playing well going into the play-offs so it really starts from now. We have to take some good form into them. We have nine games left in the league and we have to show we can do it on the pitch.’ New owner Dave King would also appreciate promotion being achieved sooner rather than later. With shareholder Mile Ashley seemingly having a stranglehold on the bulk of the profits arising from the club’s retail operation, the financially-challenged club need a fresh injection of cash. In the last few days the Three Bears consortium of Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor have donated £1.5million in order to pay this month’s wages but season-ticket renewal money in May, ideally at increased Premiership rates, is likely to be vital. Bell was speaking yesterday to publicise a new four-match ticket package for this season’s remaining home games but the improved performance against Hibs will have done as much to increase attendances at Ibrox for those fixtures. As far as the goalkeeper is concerned, however, there is more to come from Stuart McCall’s side between now and the end of May. ‘Yes, we’ve set a high bar but, at the end of the day, we are playing for Rangers Football Club so the bar should be set high,’ he said. ‘We can handle that: we should be able to handle the pressure and I’m sure we will. That performance has been in us all season and it was just a case of trying to bring it out of us. ‘I’m sure we’ll take confidence from it and we’ll work hard on the training pitch to make sure we are ready for games.’ Bell credited McCall for the transformation in the atmosphere at Ibrox. The former Motherwell manager has dispelled the gloom which surrounded the club during the dog days of McCoist and Kenny McDowall. ‘I think it’s just down to the enthusiasm the new manager has brought,’ he said. ‘He’s brought a spark to training too. Bell played for Kilmarnock when he won his only Scotland cap . ‘He was always a passionate player himself and he soon lets us know if we are doing things right in training. He’s been great and he’s brought a new lease of life to some players. ‘It’s a good start for us but we know there will be tough times ahead so we need to just take each game as it comes and concentrate on getting three points in the next game.’ Prices for a four-match value package start at £62 for adults, £50 concessions and £18 for juniors in the Club Deck subject to availability.

"Former Scotland captain Dave Mackay, legendary enforcer of Tottenham’s 1961 double winning side, has died aged 80. In an age of hard men, the stockily built midfield man was one of the toughest, a symbol of passion and fiery commitment. For years the iconic picture of him angrily holding Leeds’ equally combative Billy Bremner was framed on the wall in the players’ lounge at White Hart Lane, the club’s spiritual leader long after he’d left. Dave Mackay confronts Billy Bremner during his Tottenham days in August 1966 . Mackay is crowned by  Jimmy Robertson (right) after Spurs beat Chelsea 2-1 in the 1967 FA Cup final . Mackay won the FA Cup with Tottenham three times, in 1961, 1962 and 1967 . Tottenham manager Bill Nicholson with players Cliff Jones, Jimmy Greaves, Mackay, Paul Shoemark and Stephen Pitt in 1965 . Mackay runs up the stairs at White Hart Lane as he fights his way back from a double leg fracture . But while that image summed up his enduring aggression and determination there was so much more to his game than just his daunting physical presence. Born in Edinburgh in 1934, he was the second in a family of four boys whose father worked for The Scotsman newspaper. He began his career with his boyhood idols Hearts, winning all three domestic honours before captaining the side in 1957-8 when they won the Scottish League title – setting a British record with 132 goals scored and only 29 conceded. That persuaded Spurs to buy him in 1959 for £32,000, a transfer that manager Bill Nicholson later claimed was his greatest ever signing. He created a powerful partnership with Danny Blanchflower, and together they provided the driving force in the side that became the first post-war team to achieve the double of League title and FA Cup. In all Mackay played 318 times for Tottenham, twice recovering from a broken left leg to captain the side that won the FA Cup in 1967. In a statement, Spurs said: 'Dave Mackay will certainly always be remembered here as one of our greatest ever players and a man who never failed to inspire those around him. 'In short, a Spurs legend.' Mackay challenges Manchester United's George Best during a game during the 1970s . Best again felt the full force of Mackay's boot as the pair battle for the ball in 1971 . The famous picture was taken on the first day of that season, when Mackay reacted to a tackle he believed was designed to deliberately injure his bad leg. He was a powerful personality, the leader off the field in the days when the players would congregate in the Bell and Hare pub after matches, as well as the leader on the pitch. When Brian Clough was forging the early days of his management career in 1968 he persuaded Spurs to sell him Mackay for a bargain £5,000 – and the Scot then became captain of the team that first won promotion to the old First Division, and then captured the League title in their first season in the top flight.

He was jointly voted Footballer of the Year in 1969 alongside Tony Book, and played 122 games in all for Derby before ending his career as player-manager of Swindon. That began a management career which brought more success, starting out with Nottingham Forest and then peaking when in 1975, appointed as Derby’s manager following Clough’s resignation, he guided the club to the 1974-5 League title. Further jobs with Walsall, Doncaster and Birmingham brought less success, however, and his career ended taking jobs in Egypt and Qatar before he retired from football altogether in 1995. In later years he suffered from both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.","Dave Mackay was part of the 1961 Double winning team at Tottenham .

I thought the first one was a really good finish and the second one was sensational, so he has had a good day. ‘He is just so clever, you know. He moves the ball, takes up good positions, he is dangerous and he is just so intelligent.

He believes the Dutchman could pick two completely different line-ups capable of competing at the highest level, with little to choose between the players in training games. ‘I think it tells you about the squad and the strength in depth,’ said Carrick. ‘What more can you say? Listen, those boys (Di Maria and Falcao) are top players but I think we have got a number of players that the manager can choose from, which is great. ‘We see in training when we have games that both teams are pretty equal, when we have 11 versus 11, because that is the strength of our squad now.

"The Bay of Fundy is known for having the highest tidal range in the world. And a time-lapse video that captures the rise and fall of the ice-capped tide at Hall’s Harbour in Nova Scotia, Canada, shows the natural wonder in all its beauty. Three fishing boats in the video appear to be beached as day breaks and the large sweeping shadow is replaced by sunlight. Day breaks at Hall’s Harbour in Nova Scotia and the large sweeping shadow is replaced by sunlight . Suddenly the tide begins to rise in the distance and as water rushes through to the harbour the boats begin to rock on the surface of the bay. The surface remains frozen throughout the video, but a gap in the ice on the left shows water flooding onto the side of the bank as the level rises. Before long the water has risen to be parallel with the harbour and the boats that were once grounded sit awkwardly on the top of the ice. As the tide begins to rise water rushes through to the harbour and the boats begin to rock on the surface . Two men can be seen shovelling snow from one of the boats as the water level begins to decrease once more. They leave for the day as nightfall approaches, and darkness soon cloaks the scene. The Bay of Fundy, which has contested for world tidal dominance with the Leaf Basin in Ungava Bay, Canada, achieved the record for the highest water level ever at the head of Minas Basin on the night of the ‘Saxby Gale’ on October 4, 1869. In 1975, the Guinness Book of World Records declared that Burntcoat Head, Nova Scotia has the highest tides in the world. The water rises to be parallel with the harbour and the boats that were once grounded sit awkwardly on top . According to oceanographers, tidal resonance resulting from a coincidence of timing is the cause for the dramatic increase in water levels. However, traditional Mi'kmaq folklore attributes the high tides in the Bay of Fundy to a giant whale splashing in the water. Tens of thousands of people flocked to beauty spots on the coasts of Canada, the UK, France and the Netherlands over the weekend to catch a glimpse of the ‘tide of the century’. As nightfall approaches, darkness cloaks the scene and the water level begins to fall once more . The Guinness Book of World Records declared that Burntcoat Head, Nova Scotia has the world's highest tides . It was the first giant tide of the millennium, with experts predicting that it could reach as high as 46ft in north-eastern France. Although it is dubbed the ‘tide of the century’, the ‘supertide’ phenomenon occurs once every 18 years when a rare alignment of the sun, moon and Earth create a massive gravitational pull on the sea. The next ‘tide of the century’ will take place in March 2033.","Video captures the rise and fall of the ice-capped tide at Hall’s Harbour .

"Rory McIlroy will use his first appearance in the Arnold Palmer Invitational as his last competitive outing before attempting to complete the career grand slam in next month's Masters. McIlroy missed the cut in the Honda Classic on his PGA Tour debut at the start of the month and then hit the headlines for throwing his three iron into a lake at Doral during the WGC-Cadillac Championship, where he went on to finish joint ninth. The world No 1 spent part of last week practising at Augusta National with his father Gerry and New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as he looks to claim a first green jacket and join Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods in winning all four major titles. Rory McIlroy in action during the pro-am at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando . The event in Florida will be the world No 1's last competitive action before the Masters . 'I took three weeks off before the Masters in 2011 and it worked pretty well for 63 holes, not quite 72,' McIlroy joked in his pre-tournament press conference, a reference to his back-nine collapse in a closing 80 after starting the final round with a four-shot lead. 'I am just trying to adopt a similar approach.' Asked about his attitude at Augusta last week, the 25-year-old added: '100 per cent fun, zero per cent serious. I didn't hit any extra balls, just hit one ball the whole time. I just wanted to go and enjoy it with my dad, that's what the whole thing was about. There were four father-and-son pairs and we had a great time. 'Tee to green I know what I am doing, it's just about being comfortable on and around the greens.' McIlroy hit the headlines at Doral in the World Golf Championship for launching a club into the water . McIlroy has won all of golf's other three majors but is yet to taste success at Augusta . McIlroy revealed he had been working hard on his game for several days at home following an 'unplanned' visit from coach Michael Bannon, adding: 'I am feeling much better with my game than I was walking off Doral 10 days ago. 'I am excited in the direction it's going and to be here and get one more competitive outing and try to get myself into contention.' After getting his first look at Bay Hill, McIlroy admitted he was beginning to regret not playing the event sooner, both as the course suits his game and in order to pay his respects to Palmer. 'What Arnold Palmer has done for our game and what he's done for the PGA Tour, it was about time that I showed up here and played in his tournament,' McIlroy added. The top five in the world rankings are all competing this week - McIlroy, Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott and Jason Day - with Scott looking to bounce back from missing the cut in the Valspar Championship last week, ending his run of 45 PGA Tour events without an early exit.","Rory McIlroy will use Arnold Palmer Invitational as last competitive action before the Masters at Augusta next month .

"Joe Hart claimed his 100th clean sheet in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday when Manchester City beat West Bromwich Albion 3-0 at the Etihad. He became the 14th goalkeeper to pass the milestone but has some way to go before he can claim the crown, currently held by David James with 169. Yet at the age of 27, Hart has plenty of time left to make his way through the list that includes Peter Schmeichel, David Seaman and Edwin van der Sar. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart kept his 100th clean sheet against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday . Hart's clean sheet could have gone when Saido Berahino had this chance but the striker hit the crossbar . David James (left) and Petr Cech (right) lead the list of the most Premier League clean sheets . James, current player-manager for Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters, got his 169 from a career that saw him play for Liverpool, Aston Villa, West Ham, Manchester City and Portsmouth. Chelsea's Petr Cech would most likely have passed that total, had he not lost his place as first-choice goalkeeper to 22-year-old Thibaut Courtois under Jose Mourinho. Third-placed Mark Schwarzer left Chelsea for Leicester City on a free transfer in January as cover for the injured Kasper Schmeichel, whose dad Peter sits ninth in the list. Yet Schwarzer is running out of time to close in on Cech with the 42-year-old - the oldest player to feature in the Premier League this season - set to be relegated as Leicester sit bottom. Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard, having conceded five against Dynamo Kiev during their Europa League exit on Thursday, will look to move up the list before the 36-year-old retires. As for Hart, the man that thwarted Barcelona's Lionel Messi in the Champions League last week, he will now chase Thomas Sorensen and Jussi Jaaskelainen on 107 and 108 respectively. He will next be able to do so against Crystal Palace on April 6 after the international break with England.

"The All England Lawn Tennis Club has apologised for using the iconic Tennis Girl poster from the 1970s to promote an upcoming exhibition but will still feature the work. The poster featuring blonde model Fiona Butler, who was 18 at the time the image was taken, attracted a flurry of criticism when the official Wimbledon Twitter account included it in a post promoting the Powerful Posters exhibition. Some followers accused the home of Wimbledon of sexism for highlighting the image, taken by the late Martin Elliott in 1976 at the University of Birmingham's tennis courts and printed by Athena. 'We apologise for offence caused by the Athena Tennis Girl poster. It is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it,' the profile later said after removing the post. Athena's Tennis Girl poster caused a Twitter stir and Wimbledon was forced to apologise after using it to promote a forthcoming exhibition called Powerful Posters . Last year the dress worn by Butler in the famous image, the wooden tennis racquet she is holding, a a 1979 edition poster and a 1980s limited edition canvas print were sold at auction for £15,500. While such a price may indicate its historic value and iconic status, many on Twitter felt it had no place as a promotional tool for the exhibit in which it features at the respected venue. Tennis fan Kishore Sharma expressed her outrage on Twitter, saying: 'Can't believe Wimbledon used this pic for upcoming 'Powerful Poster Exhibition'.' Roger Federer fans who go by the name 'Fed's Angels' on Twitter, posted: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' The All England Lawn Tennis Club used the iconic poster, which will be exhibited with the handmade dress worn by model Fiona Butler and wooden racquet used in the 1976 shoot, to promote the exhibition . Even the wording of the apology attracted criticism as a Twitter user responded with the comment: 'The poster doesn't show the history of tennis, the girl isn't a tennis player, you are just publicising sexualisation of females.' And campaign group the Everyday Sexism Project asked: 'Wimbledon having deleted your tweet, can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition?' Twitter user David B backed the club, saying: 'Presumably John McEnroe will now have to be airbrushed out of Wimbledon history? These PC idiots - ""They cannot be serious!""' An All England Club spokesman has since confirmed the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology. He added: 'We're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis. 'The image in question is from a 1970s poster that was extremely popular, selling over two million copies worldwide and it is part of an historic exhibition about tennis posters dating back to 1893. 'Not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only.' Last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster, one of the world's best-selling, really is that controversial after all. Use of the saucy shot on the official Twitter page immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter . Roger Federer's fan group said: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' Sadie Hochfield tweeted: 'Ridiculous Wimbledon are getting stick for sharing iconic poster. Political correctness gone mad/don't pretend you've never seen it before!' Sara Smith-Jones posted: 'Wimbledon [has] nothing to apologise for – I think it's a great poster, is of its time in history.' Mark Staniforth said: 'Wimbledon has just tweeted an apology for any 'offence' caused by a link to the 40-year-old Athena Girl poster. The world's gone mad.' Others merely saw the funny side. 'I think Wimbledon were right to delete the Athena poster tweet,' one Twitter user wrote. 'No one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again.' The year-long exhibition will range from the earliest poster in the museum's collection, an 1893 advertisement for The Championships, through to the original artwork for this year's Grand Slam at the world famous venue in London SW19.","All England Club used iconic Athena girl image to promote exhibition .

"Arnold Palmer brought the house down when he held court on Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods at the scene of his own tournament, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, on Wednesday. After paying world No 1 McIlroy a warm tribute and expressing his delight that he had come to play in the event for the first time, the King was asked about Tiger’s absence, and the fact they supposedly spoke for an hour on the phone. Palmer gave the questioner a quizzical look and replied: ‘An hour? Whoever told you that was full of s***!’ Arnold Palmer revealed his joy that Rory McIlroy is competing for the first time in the tournament he hosts .

Woods (left) last won the competition in 2013 and is pictured receiving the trophy from Palmer . The laughter in the media tent could probably be heard 300 yards away on the golf course. The 85-year-old was in fabulous form as he confirmed that not even a dislocated shoulder suffered during a fall at his home in January will keep him away from hitting the ceremonial tee shot at the Masters, alongside Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, next month. ‘I’m going to hit a few golf balls next week and I have every intention of being at Augusta to play the first shot at the Masters, I can assure you of that,’ he said. ‘I’m looking forward to getting back in the gym. I still try to exercise three times a week because I think it’s important. Heck, I’m going to get old one of these days and I want to be in shape when it happens.’ Cue more laughter. On the subject of McIlroy, Palmer said: ’I’m so pleased he’s come this year, we’re very happy to have him. And I’ve got a good feeling about Rory this week. I’ve a feeling he’s going to snap to it and play very well.’ McIlroy has had a disappointing time of it so far in Florida. In his two previous outings in the Sunshine State, he missed the halfway cut in the Honda Classic and finished tied 9th in the Cadillac Championship at Doral. This is his last scheduled tournament before his historic tilt at a career Grand Slam at the Masters. Palmer (right) spoke to the media ahead of the start of the tournament in Florida on Thursday . Palmer said he feels McIlroy will have a good week but he has struggled lately when competing in Florida . McIlroy is in a three-ball with Rickie Fowler (left) and Jason Day for his first two rounds of the event . On the other side of the coin, Palmer expressed his disappointment that Woods, who has won this tournament at Bay Hill in Orlando no fewer than eight times, could not make it for the second successive year. ‘It was very nice of him to ring me to tell me he wasn’t coming and we will definitely miss him,’ said Palmer. ‘His record here is the best in any one tournament on the same golf course in the whole sport, so it’s a shame. 'All I would say is that he’s doing the right thing to work his way back to his best. It’s all about practising hard because that’s how you rediscover your confidence. I’ve known him since he was 3ft high and that’s how he became a great player and how he will become a great player again.’ The tournament begins on Thursday with McIlroy in a belter of a group, alongside good friend Rickie Fowler and Australian Jason Day.

We’re just about a day’s work behind now. We’ll get there.’","Arnold Palmer lauded Rory McIlroy for playing his event for the first time .

"Andy Murray is now eager to surpass the achievements of Tim Henman after matching his fellow Briton's career-wins record on Wednesday.

The victory in California saw Murray book a quarter-final match-up with Spain's Feliciano Lopez, who edged past Japan's Kei Nishikori. Referring to his win over 26-year-old Mannarino, the Scot said: 'It was a very tough match, he's playing very well this year and he's got a very tricky game. 'He's a lefty but he has a very flat backhand and a short take-back on his forehand so it's hard to read. 'He moves well and he has good hands around the net - in both sets though he played one or two loose games which helped me and I stayed solid throughout.

"Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes players will try 'every trick in the book' because of their desperation to win football matches. Television pundits Graeme Souness and Jamie Carragher - both former Liverpool players - led the criticism of Chelsea for surrounding referee Bjorn Kuipers during Wednesday's Champions League exit against Paris St Germain. Former Liverpool captain Gerrard told BBC Sport: 'I think it's normal when you play games at that level. Players want to win so much. The Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday against PSG . 'You've got managers who want to win so much, players will try every trick in the book to get over the line and try and win football matches. 'Sometimes it doesn't look nice, but we've all been guilty of it throughout our careers, of not always abiding by the rules. Football's not always going to look nice.'

With the Reds facing a cup quarter-final replay at Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn next month, the possibility of Gerrard leading the side out for a Wembley final on his birthday is still alive. He said: 'I've just got over a hamstring injury and I am fit and available for the next game.

Among the former Liverpool stars returning will be Luis Suarez, Xabi Alonso and Fernando Torres, while the likes of John Terry and Didier Drogba have also committed to the game.

Nico de Boinville kisses the Cheltenham Gold Cup following Coneygree's length and a half victory . The eight-year-old, who was ridden by conditional jockey Nico de Boinville, will not run again this season and Sara Bradstock, daughter of the late amateur rider, broadcaster and journalist, Lord Oaksey, believes Coneygree’s similarity to Denman means a crack at the Newbury race on November 28 is feasible challenge. Coneygree won the Denman Chase at the track last month on his final prep race for the Gold Cup. His family also have history in the race, with older brother Carruthers winning the 2011 Hennessy. Sara said: ‘We might consider the Betfair Chase and the King George, for sure. The world is our oyster now but, depending on what the handicapper does, we might try to win the Hennessy off top weight. ‘We know he likes Newbury and he seems to have a lot of similarities with Denman.’ De Boinville (left) and trainer Mark Bradstock are all smiles with the 2015 Gold Cup trophy .

"Guilty: Bob Hewitt was convicted of two charges of rape and one of indecent assault by the South Gauteng High Court in South Africa . A former tennis Grand Slam champion has been found guilty of raping and assaulting young girls he was coaching in the early 1980s. Australian-born Bob Hewitt, 75, had pleaded not guilty to the two charges of rape and one of indecent assault, which were brought against him by three women in 2013. But Judge Bert Bam, sitting at the South Gauteng High Court outside Johannesburg, South Africa, said that the evidence against him was 'overwhelming'. During the trial, his victims said that Hewitt, best known as a doubles star, assaulted them during private tennis lessons when they were young girls. 'Time did not erase the crimes. 'A guilty person should not go unpunished. The scales of justice tip against the accused,' Bam said. One woman testified that Hewitt had told her 'rape is enjoyable' as he assaulted her. Another victim told the court he had touched her inappropriately 34 years ago and forced her to perform a sex act on him when she was 12 and 13. Hewitt won numerous Grand Slam events during his career in the 1960s and 1970s and was named to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1992. But his name was removed from the hall of fame in 2012, following allegations that he sexually abused girls he coached. Judge Bam said he is satisfied that the two women who had accused the retired tennis player of rape and a third woman who had accused him of sexual assault were telling the truth. The judge said the striking similarities among the three womens' testimonies showed that Hewitt's conduct was calculated. Bam initially ordered that Australian-born Hewitt should be taken into custody, but said he was willing to consider bail until sentencing in April. A decision is expected later today. Wearing a suit, Hewitt sat with arms crossed and appeared impassive as the judge explained the reasoning behind his verdict for nearly two hours. His wife, Delaille, sat on a chair close to the accused's bench. He had pleaded not guilty to the two charges of rape and one of indecent assault, which were brought against him by three women in 2013 . One woman testified that Hewitt had told her 'rape is enjoyable' as he assaulted her. Another victim told the court he had touched her inappropriately 34 years ago and forced her to perform a sex act on him when she was 12 and 13 . 'I still don't think he thinks he did anything wrong,' said one of Hewitt's accusers, who is now 45. The victim, who was in court for the verdict, laid a charge of rape against Hewitt in 2011 for a crime she says he committed in 1980. She said her former coach raped her in his car before tennis practice when she was 12 years old. A South African group called Women and Men Against Children's Abuse helped two other accusers come forward and petitioned South African prosecutors until Hewitt was brought to trial this year. Hewitt was convicted of two alleged rapes that took place in the 1980s, and for a sexual assault that allegedly happened in the 1990s. Bam said the accounts of the three women who accused Hewitt were consistent and revealed a pattern of behavior by Hewitt. Hewitt, born in Australia, has spent most of his life in South Africa: In this file photograph from June 26, 1965, he is seen playing at Wimbledon . Hewitt also reached the semi-finals of the men's singles at the Australian Open three times, and won the Davis Cup with South Africa in 1974 after settling there . 'There is such a striking similarity between the evidence against the accused and his modus operandi,' said Bam. All three were gullible young girls, flattered by the attention of a renowned player, according to the judge. 'Their submissiveness in the circumstances should never have been seen as consent,' said Bam. The letters that Hewitt wrote to another of his accusers, were cited in detail as corroborating evidence. The judge said Hewitt had failed to convince him that the letters were only about tennis, as Hewitt said. Hewitt was born in Dubbo, Australia but has spent much of his life in South Africa. He won nine Grand Slam doubles and six Grand Slam mixed doubles titles in the 1960s and 1970s. Hewitt also reached the semi-finals of the men's singles at the Australian Open three times, and won the Davis Cup with South Africa in 1974 after settling there. The prosecution and defence both presented closing arguments at the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Monday. Hewitt had pleaded not guilty to all charges. His doctor said last year that Hewitt remained ill after suffering a stroke in 2010 and a heart attack in 2011.","Australian-born Bob Hewitt, 75, carried out offences in early 1980s .

Elsewhere, in an interview with Liverpool's official magazine, Henderson admitted that he is not getting complacent over inheriting the club captaincy from the departing Steven Gerrard. Although he is widely considered the favourite to take on the role, given that he has already captained the side in Gerrard's absence through injury, the England star is keeping his feet on the ground. 'Next season we'll see what happens because it might not be me succeeding Stevie, it might be someone else,' Henderson said. 'There are a lot of strong leaders in the dressing room.

"England Test captain Alastair Cook could only make three runs as he opened the batting for MCC in their match against LV= County Championship winners Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi. Having top-scored in MCC's t20 defeat to Sussex on Friday, Cook could not replicate his form as he was trapped lbw by Ryan Sidebottom, with his side all out for 221 in their first innings. Yorkshire's reply started strongly and they ended day one on 82 for two, with Adam Lyth - the man who could partner Cook on England's tour of the West Indies - hitting an unbeaten half-century. Alastair Cook was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in Abu Dhabi . Yorkshire's Ryan Sidebottom celebrates after trapping Cook lbw for just three runs . Cook will now be able to see at the closest of quarters whether or not Lyth has what it takes to occupy that spot in the wake of his first call-up earlier this week. Sidebottom removed Nick Compton - someone who has partnered Cook in Tests - with the first ball of the match as the MCC captain edged a delivery into Jonny Bairstow's gloves. Cook soon followed Compton back into the pavilion before Michael Carberry and James Hildreth steadied the ship. James Hildreth scored 89 to help MCC up to a score of 221 in their first innings in Abu Dhabi . Adam Lyth was unbeaten on 53 as Yorkshire closed day one on 82 for two in response . The duo put on 74 for the third wicket before Carberry fell for 36, but Hildreth pushed on and made 89 before Tim Bresnan got him out lbw after lunch. Daryl Mitchell (54) and Zafar Ansari (24) were the only others who could make it into double figures as the final five batsmen could only add five runs between them. Lyth then took centre-stage as he started the Yorkshire reply, although he lost fellow opener and captain Alex Lees as he was caught behind off the bowling of Matt Dunn for 11. The Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi is once again playing host to the floodlight contest . A 72-ball half-century from Lyth kept the reigning champions ticking over until Jack Leaning was caught off Ansari late in the day - with Steven Patterson brought in as night-watchman to see out the closing overs. He will return to the crease with Lyth (53 not out) on Monday with Yorkshire trailing by 139 runs with eight first-innings wickets in hand.","England Test captain scored just three runs at Sheikh Zayed Stadium .

"New Zealand coach Steve Hansen flew out of Dublin three weeks ago bemoaning boring European rugby. After Saturday’s spectacular conclusion to the 2015 Six Nations, you hope his television wasn’t on the blink at his home in Christchurch and that he caught every single second of an engrossing 240 minutes spread across the three round five matches. It was breathtaking. The three teams who entered denouement day on six points apiece — England with a +37 points difference, Ireland +33 and Wales +12 — all wound up on eight points each but with one crucial photo finish difference — Ireland’s calculus was revised upwards to +63, six better than England’s +57 and 10 clear of Wales’ +53. Mere numbers, though, can’t properly tell the tale of this nerve-shredding afternoon where credit must go to Wales for transforming a slender 14-13 interval lead in Rome into the 61-20 thrashing and igniting the subsequent thirst for points at Murrayfield and Twickenham. Jonny Sexton (left) and Paul O'Connell (right) arrive at Dublin Airport with the trophy fully in their grasp . Ireland's fans got a chance to touch the coveted Six Nations trophy outside Dublin Airport . When it all ended, with England a metre short of the French line in forlorn search of the title-clinching converted try, Hansen’s eyes should have been watering with the wonder of it all. Boring? No way. A whopping 27 tries — after just 36 in the four previous rounds’ dozen games — in a 221-point attacking rugby harvest. Amazing. Pivotal moments were numerous. With eight-try Wales 48 points clear of Italy, a margin that would have set Ireland the target of a 28-point win in Edinburgh, a vital late twist had the air of 2007 revisited (Italy scored a late try eight years ago to cut Ireland’s margin and France won the title by a points difference of +4). Azzurri winger Leonardo Sarto proved unstoppable from his 10-metre line, touching down on 79:24 for the converted try that saw Ireland’s desired goal suddenly become a more manageable 21. Rob Kearney (centre) holds the Six Nations trophy in front of a mixture of youthful and experienced fans . Having scored just four tries in 320 minutes, they doubled that tally through Paul O’Connell’s fifth-minute opener and Sean O’Brien’s 25th and 72nd-minute brace either side of Jared Payne’s 50th-minute effort. Then, Jamie Heaslip won a seemingly lost cause, marvellously knocking the ball from Stuart Hogg as he went to ground for a consolation Scotland try. It set England the chase of a 26-point victory and they fell short, referee Nigel Owens penalising them on 80:12 at a ruck for sealing off. Ireland were champions and it was just as well. If England had pounced for that deciding converted try, the finger of blame would have been pointed in Scotland at both Johnny Sexton and Ian Madigan. With Ireland 20 points ahead and needing another score to jump ahead of Wales on the table, Sexton inexplicably missed two penalty kicks in quick succession. Jamie Heaslip (centre) poses for a photograph with a young fan after returning to Ireland . The first effort, from in front of the posts close in, collided with an upright and the second, from the 10-metre line, drifted wide to the right. He eventually recomposed himself, landing the pole-taking penalty on 62 minutes before signing off nine minutes later with cramp having energetically applied pressure to earn the lineout that was a foundation for the revitalised O’Brien’ s second try. There was still time for another sloppy penalty miss, a nervous Madigan pulling his close-in attempt to the left, but it would have been cruel had this hat-trick of missed penalties come back to haunt them a few hours later. Unlike Wales, who needed a last-second penalty to secure a one-point Stadio Olimpico half-time lead, and unlike England, 15-10 in arrears until the 27th minute in London, Ireland hit the front early and resolutely stayed there against the winless Scots, their only defensive aberration being Rob Kearney’s error which left Robbie Henshaw defending a three-on-one overlap down the blindside of the ruck for Finn Russell’s converted try on the half hour. Ireland were crowned Six Nations winners after a dramatic final day that saw them edge England and Wales . Other than this repeated weakness in shackling breakdown ball quickly shifted from right to left (France and Wales scored against them in the same corner and England came within a whisker of doing the same), Ireland fixed the issues that betrayed them in Wales. They didn’t get stuck at the Murrayfield ruck, didn’t start lethargically, didn’ t trail by a dozen points 14 minutes in due to poor indiscipline, didn’t tactically kick inaccurately and didn’t blow up damagingly at the lineout due to talismanic O’Connell taking on the responsibility of calling a plethora of ball on himself. Exuding pride in his team’s resilience to overcome the disappointment of blowing their Grand Slam chance, Joe Schmidt hailed his skipper for grabbing the team by the scruff of the neck post–Wales and engineering the title-winning response. Ireland powered to a 40-10 victory over Scotland at Murrayfield that won them the Six Nations title . England beat France 55-35 at Twickenham but it wasn't enough to overhaul Ireland . ‘You could see them starting to bounce back on Thursday. I texted the players on Tuesday and just said, “Training wasn’t flash today but get a day’s rest and let’s start from scratch on Thursday and really launch ourselves into this last challenge”,’ he said. That 24-word missive had the desired effect. ‘You know when you ask something of them they are going to give it their very best shot. It’s funny, we took a fair bit of confidence out of Cardiff. ‘You give Wales a 12-point head start, a Lions pack team, get to within four and really put pressure on them — that in its own way gave us a little bit of confidence even though we didn’t get the result.’ Seven days later, that Grand Slam-destroying outcome was forgotten. Ireland were back-to-back champions for the first time in 66 years and their spontaneous celebrations, just like the calibre of their rugby, were anything but boring and anything but one dimensional.","Ireland win Six Nations on points difference from England and Wales .

"The Australia and India squads have had ample time in the past four months to work each other out, ensuring a level of tension for their World Cup semi-final expected to go well beyond the usual for a knockout game. Australia all-rounder James Faulkner won't be surprised if there's some niggle and verbal exchanges, just like he's not surprised that defending champion India shook off their poor form leading into the World Cup to win seven consecutive matches. 'They've spent a fair bit of time in the country, so they've adapted well to the conditions,' Faulkner told a news conference Monday.

Watson bats during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match between Australian and Pakistan at Adelaide Oval . India didn't win a competitive match between the time the squad landed in Australia in November until its opening World Cup game against Pakistan on February 15. In that time, it lost a test series to Australia, and was winless in a limited-overs tri-series against Australia and England. There was some glaring aggression between the teams in the test and ODI series, with players on both sides sanctioned and warned that sledging would not be tolerated at the World Cup. All-rounder Shane Watson was fined last week for his part in an exchange with Pakistan paceman Wahab Riaz . Australian all-rounder Shane Watson was fined last week for his part in an exchange with Pakistan paceman Wahab Riaz during a torrid spell of fast, short-pitch bowling that was easily the highlight of the quarterfinal in Adelaide. Faulkner said that exchange was 'all in great spirit,' and he expected more spirited exchanges with a spot in the final at stake at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday. 'There's going to be words said and it's going to be a really tough contest,' Faulkner said, adding that there's usually some sledging on the field. 'It's the nature of the game, it's a semi-final. Cut throat. Neither team will be backing down.' Watson plays a short pitched ball from Riaz of Pakistan during the  World Cup match at the Adelaide Oval . The India squad practiced at the SCG on Monday but, as have become the usual routine at the World Cup, remained off limits to the media until the eve of the match. The Sydney venue is expected to be packed with traveling India fans who may outnumber Australia supporters and possibly make it seem more like an away game for the locals. 'We were talking about it last night at dinner, the last game we played here it definitely felt like that,' Faulkner said. 'The passion the Indian fans show toward their cricket team is sensational, so we're definitely expecting that.'","Hosts Australia take on India at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday .

He scored 189 not out against England in 2013 and said, looking back at that innings, he felt he could have achieved the mark then. ‘I did muck around in the middle overs of that innings but I wouldn’t take it back at all,’ added Guptill. ‘To set the record and then break it again is pretty amazing and I just have to try to do it again I guess.’ The batsman recorded the second highest one-day international score in the sports history with 237 .

"Fabian Delph can be an instrumental figure in England winning Euro 2016, according to Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood. Roy Hodgson called Delph into his squad for the coming matches against Lithuania and Italy, to little surprise for Sherwood having tried to sign the 25-year-old at Tottenham. ‘Roy will stumble across a team that will win the Euros. He will, I tell you. They will win it,’ said Sherwood. ‘I feel we’ve got top young talent who will have another year’s football. A lot of them would play for any country across Europe.

Delph penned fresh terms in January. ‘I spoke to his agent in London and told him that if I was still in charge at Tottenham, I’d definitely want him to come. I tried my best. He’d cost too much money now, but he would have been a bargain then. ‘He’s got a change of pace and a hammer of a left foot. I think he’s got the ability to drop his shoulder and go past people.

"Toby Alderweireld knows Southampton need to beat Burnley this weekend if they are to maintain their push for European football. A summer of despair at St Mary's has been followed by a quite remarkable season, leaving Saints sixth in the standings with just nine matches remaining. Last weekend's 1-1 draw at Chelsea boosted their hopes of European qualification - a match in which Alderweireld performed fantastically on his return from a hamstring injury. It was a positive display after a frustrating time of late and the Belgium international knows Saints have to follow it up with a win at home to Burnley on Saturday. Toby Alderweireld is keen for Southampton to keep winning to maintain the push for Europe . 'It was great after two months seeing from the sidelines to play again,' Alderweireld said. 'With a bit of luck, a good defence and a great goalkeeper we got a point. 'It's important we don't look too far in the future because it won't help. We can be happy with the point at Chelsea, but if we lose on Saturday what does it mean? 'We want to achieve something good, something special this season, so we have to win. That's game by game.

Leon Osman believes Everton's win over QPR on Sunday shows the Toffees can win ugly when needed . Osman points at goalscorer Seamus Coleman after the defender had fired Everton ahead at Loftus Road . 'Certain games sometimes call for certain styles of play and the way the game goes dictates how you end up playing,' Osman said. 'Every time we lost the ball it was sent up to the edge of our box so we had to fight and scrap for second balls. 'It was a scrappy match defensively but we proved we can do that side of the game and then once you've done that, you have the opportunity to hit teams on the counter attack, which we tried to do. 'There was probably not as much football played as we usually like but there's no problem winning like that as well.' Aaron Lennon (left) celebrates after scoring the winning goal for Everton against Queens Park Rangers . The victory was Everton's second in a row in the league and saw Roberto Martinez's side bounce back from a disappointing 5-2 Europa League defeat to Dynamo Kiev on Thursday. 'It was a massive win for us after we suffered a big disappointment in the week,' Osman continued. 'It hasn't quite happened in the league this season so to put back-to-back wins together was really important for us. 'We were terrific at the back, especially Phil Jagielka. I thought he was at his best and we dealt with all their situations quite well. The winger slots home the crucial goal to move the Toffees closer to safety with the win at Loftus Road . 'It was always going to be difficult with the pitch as it is and with the way they played. 'They made it difficult for us but we stood up to that challenge head on and came away with a victory. 'We've still got eight games left and we're going to concentrate on those games now and just see how many points we can pick up.'","Everton beat QPR 2-1 at Loftus Road in the Premier League on Sunday .

"Jeremy Mathieu has quashed rumours that Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi could be on his way to Paris Saint Germain and is adamant the Argentine will stay put at the Nou Camp. At the turn of the year Messi's future at the Catalan giants was brought into question amid stories he was unhappy under boss Luis Enrique. However the forward - who is under contract until 2018 - has gone on to score 17 league goals for his club so far in 2015 and his colleague is convinced his heart remains well and truly placed in the Catalan capital.

"Rohit Sharma hit his maiden World Cup century as India claimed a clinical 109 run victory over Bangladesh in the second quarter-final here on Thursday. It was the reigning World Cup champions’ 11th consecutive victory in a World Cup, second best only to Australia’s run of 25 matches between 2003-2011, as MS Dhoni won his 100th one-day international match as captain. Featuring in their first ever World Cup knockout match Bangladesh promised much early on as they restricted India to 125-3 from 30 overs but fell away under the pressure of the occasion, though there was an element of controversy. The platform for the resounding victory was set-up by Rohit’s measured innings as India posted 302 for six and was backed-up by an impressive 4-31 from Umesh Yadav as Bangladesh were bowled out for 193. Rohit Sharma hits out during his potentially match-winning innings of 137 for India at the MCG . Sharma hits through the onside on his way to a century for India against Bangladesh in Melbourne . Sharma celebrates as he reaches his hundred in India's the World Cup quarter final at the MCG . Sharma jumps for joy on reaching his hundred in what turned out to be a match-winning innings . It’s hard to think of another set of fans that turn out in such support for their side and with such vociferously worldwide as the Indian supporters do. At times the noise from the immensely vocal crowd will tell you all you need to know about what is going on in the middle. And, while that support no doubt buoys the Indian players, it equally places them under an incredible amount of pressure. The type of pressure that has seen Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja’s places in the side constantly questioned because of the limited time they spent in the middle during the tournament. The mere fact that they have batted so little because the rest of India’s batsmen have performed so well is left by the way side. But if any of the players are feeling the weight of burden upon them then they are refusing to let it affect their game. In fact the players have risen to the task. Rohit Sharma is congratulated for his milestone by India captain MS Dhoni on Thursday . Rohit finally fell in the 47th over when he was bowled by Bangladeshi quick Taskin Ahmed . Rohit's innings of 137 from 126 balls came to an end after Taskin Ahmed endured some punishment . India's Suresh Raina goes aerial for a six in his innings of 65, India's second highest score . Raina celebrates reaching his half-century as India's batsman struggled to score quickly . Arguably Sharma came into this match as one the few top-order Indian batsmen who had yet to really impress, having made just 159 runs in his previous six innings. When required though, the 27-year-old rose to the challenge producing some of the best shots of the entire tournament. The Indian innings began uncharacteristically slowly as Bangladesh’s attack produced a master class in tight bowling. Shikhar Dhawan, having prodded and probed his way to a modest 30 of 50 balls, was stumped off the bowling of Shakib Al Hasan after being beaten by the flight of the ball and failing to drag his foot back in time. England’s ultimate destroyer Rubel Hossain erupted in jubilation eight balls later as he had star batsman Virat Kohli caught behind for just three. The dismissal was all the more impressive, with Mushfiqur Rahim taking a low catch, as the wicketkeeper was stood so far back a car could have fit between him and the stumps. Bangladesh wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim whips off the bails to dismiss India opener Shikhar Dhawan . Dhawan was given out for 30 from the bowling of Shakib Al Hasan as India's opening partnership ended on 75 . Taskin Ahmed (left) and Mashrafe Mortaza chest bump in celebration after the wicket of Ajinkya Rahane . Ahmed was the pick of Bangladesh's bowlers with three wickets for 69 runs off his 10 overs . Ahmed (left) and Shakib Al Hasan (right) fall to the ground laughing as Rahane walks back to the pavilion . And when Ajinkya Rahane mistimed a loft over extra-cover from a fuller Taskin Ahmed delivery to depart for painful 19 off 37 balls, India looked to be struggling. If discipline defined the first 30 overs for Bangladesh, having bowled an impressive 107 of those 180 as dot balls, then meltdown almost perfectly defined the last 17. Mashrafe Mortaza took the ball in the first over of the batting powerplay and after Suresh Raina sent the ball between two fielders, the Bangladeshi captain stood and berated his players. However, the game-changing over followed four overs later as Rubel believed he had Rohit caught at deep midwicket for 90, only for the delivery to be called a waist-high no ball. Confusion ensued, with the Bangladeshi players calling for a third-umpire second opinion but Ian Gould remained unmoved and Rohit remained at the crease. After reaching his ton off 108 balls the right-handed batsman let loose, lofting a beautiful inside-out drive for six. Taskin eventually had his man, bowling an excellent yorker – a delivery so rare now but still a marvel when produced perfectly – as Rohit departed to a standing ovation from the 51,000 strong crowd. Bangladesh's Rubel Hossain gives key wicket Virat Kohli an impassioned send off as he's dismissed . Hossain followed a series of short balls with a full and wide delivery that caught Kohli's outside edge . Tamim Iqbal got Bangladesh off to a steady start with a run a ball 25 before falling to Umesh Yadav . Yadav celebrates his breakthrough as he finds Iqbal's edge and MS Dhoni takes the catch to make it 33-1 . It seemed surprising then that the 19-year-old bowler was another who found himself on the end of a verbal rollicking from his captain as India passed the 300 run mark for the third time in the tournament. At the beginning of the year 302-6 would probably have been seen as an achievable target against an Indian bowling attack that looked anything but international players. But with MS Dhoni’s pack of bowlers having claimed 60 wickets in six matches Bangladesh needed Tamim Iqbal to fire from the beginning. Having found the boundary rope four times, Tamim departed for a run-a-ball 25 as Dhoni took a low catch off Yadav’s bowling. Without a run being added to their total, a mix-up in the middle saw Imrul Kayes run-out for five and Bangladesh two down for 33. Bangladesh did their to best to keep up with the rate but the constant loss of wickets hindered their chances of making the match a contest. Without adding a run Mahmudullah (left) and Imrul Kayes found themselves at the same end of the pitch .

Soumya Sarkar (29), Mushfiqur (27), Sabbir Rahman (30) and Nassir Hossain (35) all made starts but Bangladesh failed to ever really trouble the Indian bowlers who bowled out their opposition for a seventh consecutive match. While Rohit walked away with the man-of-the-match award, having become the fourth Indian batsman to hit a century during this World Cup, the Indian bowlers contribution to the side remains invaluable. Ridiculed ahead of the start of the tournament and spoken of as India’s weak link, Yadav, Mohammad Shami and Mohit Sharma continue to carry their side to outstanding victories. India look intent on holding on to the World Cup and at the moment it would take a very brave individual to bet against them.

"Paddy McNair admits he will fulfil his boyhood dream if he earns his first Northern Ireland cap against Scotland on Wednesday night. The Manchester United defender has been given his first taste of top-team action at Old Trafford by new boss Louis van Gaal this season. Now he is set to follow that up by making his international debut in Glasgow when Michael O'Neill's side take on the Scots at Hampden Park. Paddy McNair has made an impressive breakthrough for Manchester United this season at the back . The 19-year-old was forced to pull out of his first involvement with the national team last October due to injury, while he was an unused substitute a month later as the Irish lost 2-0 away to Romania. But he is expected to finally pull on the green jersey in the midweek friendly clash that will serve as a warm-up ahead of Sunday's crucial Euro 2016 qualifier with Finland at Windsor Park. 'It would be a dream come true if that happens,' said the teenage centre-half. 'As a young boy it is a dream to play for your country. 'I went to a few Northern Ireland games when I was very young but I don't remember too much about them. I can remember the atmosphere and hoping that one day I would be out there as well, so if I can do that on Wednesday I will be very proud.' The Northern Irishman competes with the Premier League's newest star Harry Kane at White Hart Lane . Wednesday's match will be just as important to the Scots as it is O'Neill's troops as both countries look to end their long absences from major tournaments by claiming a slot at next year's European Championships in France. While Northern Ireland are just a point off the summit of Group F after taking nine points from the first 12 available, Gordon Strachan's side are very much in the hunt themselves. They sit third in Group D, three points behind leaders Poland and level on seven with Germany and the Republic of Ireland. With that in mind, McNair does not expect an easy introduction to the international game. 'It's going to be tough,' he said. 'It's a game against another home nation and both teams want to win. It won't be a friendly. The 19-year-old has seen his game time limited in recent weeks but has done enough to earn a call-up . 'It's a game we can definitely win, though. We showed in the games in the qualifying group we can beat anybody. 'Scotland have some very good players. I've played against Steven Naismith earlier on this season and you can see why people rate him so highly.' McNair can also expect to come up against another familiar face clad in Dark Blue, with former United midfielder Darren Fletcher likely to line-up for the hosts. The 31-year-old - who quit the Red Devils in January after 12 years to sign for West Brom - played an influential dressing-room role while McNair was making his way through the Old Trafford ranks. Darren Fletcher (right) was influential in helping McNair settle into the United dressing room before he left . And the youngster happily admits he owes the four-time Premier League winner a huge debt of gratitude. 'Darren really helped me a lot and have to thank him a lot for that,' said McNair. 'When I first broke into the team he gave me a lot of advice and really did help me settle in. 'When you come through at Manchester United, it is such a big club with so much pressure on you. 'Darren was in the same position I'm in now at one stage so he would often come up to me before games and have a word to make sure my head was on right. 'Darren is a great player and I'm very happy to see him back playing regularly with West Brom.' Louis van Gaal took a risk on McNair when he had a shortage of defenders and was rewarded for his trust . In the 13 games McNair has racked for Van Gaal's side this term, he has done enough to leave the Dutchman so impressed that he reckons the Ballyclare youth could be a mainstay of the United line-up for the next decade. But McNair himself is trying not to look too far ahead. He said: 'I don't think I will really realise how good a season I have had until the end of the season when I look back at it, but so far I'm very happy. 'Am I surprised at how quickly things have gone this year? Yeah a little bit. 'Sometimes you just need a bit of luck to get your chance. But I was confident that once I got my chance I could take it.'","Paddy McNair could earn his first Northern Ireland cap against Scotland .

"With  Robin van Persie not due to return for Manchester United until next month, if ever there was a time for Radamel Falcao to prove his worth at Old Trafford then it is now. Unfortunately for manager Louis van Gaal it appears that Falcao’s surprise selection for United’s Under 21s in a 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Tuesday has done little to repair the shattered confidence that has characterised the 29-year-old’s loan spell. Van Gaal confirmed on Friday that Van Persie will not be fit until after the forthcoming international break and although he insisted his decision to play Falcao in the second string was not intended to humiliate the player, he hinted that the plan may not have worked. Radamel Falcao was dumped in Manchester United's Under 21s team on Tuesday night vs Tottenham . Falcao did not manage to get on the scoresheet against Tottenham Hotspur's Under 21s and was poor . United boss Louis van Gaal says Falcao's demotion was in order to boost his confidence . Van Gaal was speaking at United's pre-match press conference on Friday ahead of their clash vs Tottenham . 6 - Louis van Gaal could oversee an unwanted milestone on Sunday, as Tottenham look to make it six games unbeaten against Manchester United. 1921 - The last time Spurs managed this was a century ago, when they won four and drew two games either side of World War One, between February 1914 and October 1921. 3 - If Spurs win it will be the first time they have had three consecutive victories at Old Trafford. 1 - If Tottenham manage at least a draw, they will become the first team to go six games unbeaten against United in the Premier League era. 'People wrote that it was humiliation to play him in the second team. But a lot of players have played there this season. 'So I don't think so. It just shows a professional attitude of the manager, the staff and the player. 'Victor Valdes also played and Rafael da Silva. Rafael played a very good match and scored a very good goal so he will now have a better grip on his confidence. 'That can happen to all the players playing in the second team. It's a lower level and they can play more than the 70 minutes they get in training. 'Falcao did not play his best match for the second team but he tried and he did his utmost best. 'I can not ask for more from him. He has shown a professional attitude. 'We pay a lot of money for the players and so it is normal that they play football for us. Falcao has not reacted to this the way the media has reacted. That's the difference.' Robin van Persie has been sidelined since sustaining an ankle injury against Swansea on February 21 . Falcao tries to escape from Spurs U21 duo Bongani Khumalo (left) and Grant Ward (right) on Tuesday . More than seven months after signing the player, Van Gaal is still unable to fathom why he has been unable to replicate the stellar form he showed for Colombia, Porto and Atletico Madrid. 'You never can know that,' Van Gaal said when asked why things had not worked out for the 29-year-old, whom United have an option to buy for £43.2million at the end of the season. 'We are looking for the solution for him but you can never know that. 'You can give fantastic performances in another country but not in the country that you are present for. 'That is not the first example and it will not be the last example. A lot of players need more time to adapt to the new situation, new culture, higher rhythm of the English game and to a lot of aspects.' The striker has spent plenty of time warming the bench at Old Trafford - including in their last two games . Falcao has started the last two games on the bench and Van Gaal does not appear to be in any kind of rush to recall the striker. 'In a club like Manchester United it is more difficult than in a minor club because here he has his competitors,' Van Gaal added. 'Now Wayne (Rooney) is playing there and Wayne is scoring so you always have to compare players with each other but you need also luck. 'He is doing his utmost best and shows a professional attitude, not only Falcao but all the other players, but you cannot always win.' With Falcao only boasting four goals for United this season, Van Persie’s absence continues to hurt Van Gaal and his team. Asked about the Dutch striker’s possible return against Tottenham tomorrow, he said: ‘No, he is still with the medical department. He’s training inside, not outside on the pitch. It will be the other side of the international break.’ Van Gaal won a trophy in his first season at Ajax, Bayern Munich and Barcelona, but the chances of him doing so at United are remote. Falcao celebrates scoring against Leicester, one of only four goals he has netted for United since joining . The 2-1 defeat by Arsenal knocked United out of the FA Cup on Monday and in the league, Van Gaal's men are 10 points behind Chelsea, who have a match in hand. United are fourth in the standings, just one point ahead of Liverpool, with 10 matches left. Van Gaal is sure his team's confidence has not been affected by the cup exit to the Gunners. 'I have the same confidence as before,' said Van Gaal, who has fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool after Saturday's home game against Tottenham. 'We were very disappointed at the last game because the players had the feeling that we lost (because of) ourselves and not (because of) the opponent. 'But I am very pleased with the reaction from the players this week and I hope we can show that against Tottenham because it is the first of 10 matches we have to play in the rat race.'","Manchester United host Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday .

"David Gill will be one of the 'awkward squad' asking searching questions if he is elected as Britain's FIFA vice-president, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has claimed. Gill, the former Manchester United chief executive, is standing against Wales' Trefor Lloyd Hughes for the position, which is being elected by UEFA's 54 members at its congress in Vienna on Tuesday. Dyke, who has made clear his opposition to FIFA president Sepp Blatter continuing in the position, said Gill would act as a counter-balance to the 'acolytes' on FIFA's executive committee. The FA chairman said: 'David will be the sort of person who will do the job as a FIFA executive committee member properly. He will not be afraid of asking appropriate questions - in fact perhaps FIFA needs to have someone from the awkward squad asking tough questions. 'He has a strong background in finance so if there are financial questions he will know what to ask and what to look for. David Gill, pictured with Sir Alex Ferguson in 2011, is running for Britain's FIFA vice-president . 'There is a feeling that there have been too many acolytes and not enough people asking difficult questions and ensuring that decisions are taken in a transparent, ethical and business-like manner. 'Michel Platini (UEFA president) was very keen for David to stand for the position and to represent UEFA on the FIFA executive committee.' Gill himself admits that change cannot happen overnight. He said: 'I aim to use my skills in football around the table and work with my UEFA colleagues to have a greater say and influence in how it operates. In terms of votes it's quite an important block. 'In areas like transparency and decision-making, it's not going to happen overnight and it's arguable whether it will happen unless there is a president change. 'My personal view is that it needs a change at the top to ensure that the required changes take place. I'm not naive enough to think I can change things overnight.' FA chairman Greg Dyke claimed that Gill would not be afraid of asking appropriate questions . The Football Association of Wales has claimed its English counterparts have reneged on a deal agreed in 2011 which would see a Welsh nominee replace Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce as FIFA vice-president. Gill said the agreement became void after FIFA reforms, which saw the British FIFA vice-presidency elected by all UEFA members instead of just the four home nations. He added: 'If there was a deal, that then changed after the reforms. It may be semantics but it previously was the British vice-president of FIFA. Now it's UEFA electing a FIFA vice-president. 'We (the FA) very clearly took the view, as did UEFA, that the 54 countries of UEFA will determine that person and I think that makes sense. It's more democratic to have that person selected by all 54 countries. If there had been that agreement, if it hadn't been torn up, then obviously it would be the Welsh turn.'","David Gill standing for role of Britain's FIFA vice-president .

"Gus Poyet could not have looked more despondent at the final whistle had the fans who tried to storm his dugout in the first half got to him, vented their ire in his face and made it crystal clear they felt that he was to blame. ‘I am responsible,’ he said, looking as gloomy as at any point since he became Sunderland’s manager in October 2013. ‘I’m extremely disappointed. I wasn’t expecting this to happen. But it’s football, I suppose.’ It’s football, too, that woeful form and defeats like these lead to managerial sackings. Poyet’s job prospects looked more dire by the minute as this match wore on. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke slotted home the first goal in the 16th minute to end Villa's goal drought on the road . Gabriel Agbonlahor ran on to Ciaran Clark's long ball and beat Sunderland keeper Costel Pantilimon to make it 2-0 .

Christian Benteke was a constant thorn in Sunderland defence.CLICK HERE to see more from Sportsmail's MATCH ZONE . Christian Benteke and Gabby Agbonlahor scored twice each in a spectacular first-half goal rush to end Aston Villa’s scoring drought away from home. ‘That was good,’ said their manager Tim Sherwood. ‘We knew we could hurt them on the break with our pace and we used it … I’m delighted with that.’ Thus Villa leapfrogged Sunderland and now look up towards safety while Sunderland’s position remains precarious just above the relegation zone, no signs of revival in sight. The fans are revolting already, several of them apparently intent on launching physical attacks on Poyet at 3-0 down. They were escorted from the dugout but other dangers remain for Poyet. The pre-match narrative anticipated a dour 0-0 but the result and manner in which it was achieved left that not so much turned on its head but stumbling dazed to the exit. Like Poyet. Like many home fans even before half-time. A shocking lack of goals has characterised both teams all season, Villa particularly. At the start of the day they had 38 league goals — between them. Sunderland now have one league win in 12 games and Villa have two in two, and three wins on the bounce in all competitions. Sherwood’s appointment has had the transformational effect owner Randy Lerner envisaged and that many observers were sceptical would happen. Agbonlahor cut inside Wes Brown before calmly slotting the ball past Pantilimon for a second time in the 37th minute . Benteke extended the lead a minute before the break when he powered a header home from a Bacuna cross . Benteke celebrates scoring their fourth goal against Sunderland on Saturday . Villa had scored a measly 15 Premier League goals this season before kick-off and an even more pitiful four of those away from home, in seven months. It took 45 minutes to add another four. Sherwood affected ignorance about the extent to which Villa had been goal-shy before his arrival. ‘To be honest, I’d not taken too much notice of Aston Villa before I came here,’ he said. ‘But we’ve not had trouble scoring goals since I’ve been here … losing becomes a habit. Winning does also.’ Sherwood and Poyet played together at Tottenham and asked if he had sympathy for his old friend’s plight, Sherwood said: ‘Always. It’s not good when you get beaten heavily at home. But Gus will bounce back. He’s got a bigger heart than anyone.’ Poyet’s players lacked heart, application and attention as they were steamrollered by Sherwood’s revitalised side before the break. In a sustained flow of one-way Villa traffic and atrocious Sunderland defending, the visitors put the game to bed nice and early. Leandro Bacuna set up the opener with a square ball to Benteke, who side-footed with his left foot low into the net.

Sunderland fans attempt to storm Gus Poyet's dugout as the home side fell behind to Aston Villa . That brought to an end a Villa goal drought away from home that stretched back to December 2 last year: it had endured for six full league games and 614 minutes. It was something of a shock — and a source of joy bordering on delirium for their supporters — when Villa doubled the lead inside two minutes. Centre back Ciaran Clark sent a hoof the length of the left flank to Agbonlahor, who ran with it and slotted home diagonally. Villa might well have been three ahead when Bacuna, again, made swift, easy progress down the right and crossed, to Scott Sinclair. But Sinclair could only blaze over the bar from close range. The third goal came via a Charles N’Zogbia pass to the edge of the box, from where Agbonlahor slalomed past Wes Brown and Patrick van Aanholt before slotting home. With a minute remaining before the break, Bacuna was supplier again from the right, this time a high ball with pinpoint accuracy onto the head of Benteke, who nodded home past Costel Pantilimon. The game was over as a contest. When Sebastian Larsson failed to appear for the second half, with play ongoing for three and a half minutes before he came from the tunnel, some wags in the crowd joked he may have feared getting back out there. In fact he had needed stitches in what Poyet said was ‘a massive cut’ in his leg. By the time he arrived N’Zogbia, set up by Benteke, had already tested Pantilimon again. Sunderland’s Anthony Réveillere and Villa’s Fabian Delph both had shots saved. But Sunderland never threatened to get back into this, not remotely. ‘We’re gonna win 5-4,’ chanted their fans.

"QPR defender Mauricio Isla is convinced his Chile international colleague Alexis Sanchez will become the best player in the world after a sensational start to his Arsenal career this season. Sanchez and Isla were this week included in a 20-man Chile squad to play a friendly against Brazil at the Emirates Stadium on March 29, and also against Iran. Sanchez, who has scored 18 goals this season, has helped fire Arsenal to third in the Premier League table, where they sit just a point behind Manchester City. And Isla, who is on a season-long loan deal at Loftus Road from Juventus after impressing for Chile at last summer's World Cup in Brazil, believes Sanchez has all the ingredients – and the temperament – to eclipse even Barcelona striker Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo as the best in the business. Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez can become the best players in the world, according to Mauricio Isla . 'I have known him for ten years and I think Alexis has shown what he is made of,' said Isla. 'He has always said that he wanted to be the best in the world and now he has arrived in a team where this can truly become a reality. 'He can build confidence and where they play for him and he transmits the confidence that his teammates give him but honestly, I am not at all surprised by the quality of Alexis as a player. 'I am proud to play alongside him for Chile, as I am proud to play alongside Arturo Vidal of Juventus and Claudio Bravo of Barcelona among others. I think together we are able to succeed and it would be fantastic for our country. Sanchez was one of Chile's star men at the World Cup and will be a key man at the Copa America . 'Alexis Sanchez is a leader as are the other two. Of course, the team is a group but there are always role models in any team and I think these three in particular are fundamental to ours. 'There are always high quality players and these three are the pillars of our team and the rest of us must accompany them to achieve great things. 'Firstly Alexis Sanchez provides what I believe we lacked before which are his goals. 'It's fantastic that he is scoring so much which fills him with confidence and joy and I hope he continues to keep scoring always more. 'If we were to talk about his characteristics, we could be here all day but for me, I love playing with a player who's so bold, who is a fighter, runs for 90 minutes and always loves training. 'I have heard from many of his Arsenal teammates also that he never tires in training or on the pitch and this is fundamental for the team.' QPR's Mauricio Isla is proud to play for Chile alongside the likes of Sanchez and Arturo Vidal of Juventus . Also included in the squad is Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, former Cardiff midfielder Gary Medel, Fiorentina's David Pizarro, QPR's Eduardo Vargas and Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal. And Isla has issued a warning to Brazil boss Dunga to expect a serious test against fellow South Americans Chile at the Emirates Stadium. The friendly in North London will take on extra significance as Brazil secured a dramatic penalty shootout win against Chile to reach the last eight at the World Cup last summer and set up an all-South American quarter-final against Colombia. 'It's a game that give brings up some pain, for everything that happened in the World Cup which was a beautiful game, I think as much for Brazil as it was for Chile,' added Isla. 'The game played on for 120 minutes before going to penalties and sadly Brazil won but they really had to work for it. 'To play this game as a revenge match in a beautiful country, and beautiful city such as London, all Chileans will take interest and I hope it goes well.'

"Wayne Rooney responded in style to revelations that he had been knocked-out while boxing in his own kitchen, by leading Manchester United to victory, scoring a wonderful goal and producing a punch-drunk celebration. A resounding 3-0 win against Tottenham kept United in the top four of the Barclays Premier League and lifted spirits at Old Trafford. The goals came from Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Rooney, who had been in the spotlight on a day when The Sun broadcast video footage of him being floored by a punch from Stoke defender Phil Bardsley during an impromptu sparring session. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney re-enacted a video of him boxing a former team-mate . Rooney punched the air, before falling backwards in a similar fashion to what can be seen in the video . Rooney manages to keep a straight face as he falls directly backwards onto the Old Trafford turf . The two footballers, wearing boxing gloves, square up in Rooney's kitchen and spar for a few seconds before Bardsley lands a jab to put the England and United skipper flat on his back, seemingly unconscious. Rooney voiced his disappointment that a private moment, filmed inside his home on February 22, had been made public, a view shared by Louis van Gaal, who was clearly irritated by the story and seemed unperturbed by the nature of his captain's pastime. After scoring United's third against Spurs, Rooney let fly with a flurry of fake punches and fell on his back, much as he did in the video clip taken last month, although the Old Trafford turf seemed to provide a far softer landing than his kitchen tiles. 'That's the world we live in today,' said Rooney. 'It was a few mates in a private house which has somehow managed to get on the front page of a national newspaper. I have to accept that. It was me and a few friends joking around. 'It's my own home, I know it's got out but it's not public. It's what friends do. They mess around in the house and unfortunately it has made the front page of a national newspaper. 'I've just been focused on the game, it's more interesting for other people rather than for myself. You've seen that I've done a professional job, got on with the game and gladly helped my team win 3-0.' The England captain stretches his hands out behind him to break his fall as he hits the ground . Rooney was joined by laughing team-mates as he fell on the ground during his celebration . For a few seconds, Rooney lay on the Old Trafford pitch with his arms spread wide while being congratulated . Carrick admitted the players had been teasing Rooney about his sparring antics, while Fellaini revealed how the skipper had delivered a rousing speech to the squad in the team hotel on the eve of the game. 'I was aware of the speech but was not in the meeting because the captain has his own privilege,' said Van Gaal. 'The players knew this game was massive and the captain has to do something to help the players, the manager or the club. I was very pleased. 'I don't want to answer questions about what happened. What is this world, twisted? I don't have any comment. It is ridiculous that we have to talk about such things.' The Dutchman was happier to discuss Rooney's performance. 'It's always how Wayne plays,' said Van Gaal. 'With a lot of commitment and that's nice to see. 'We have waited a long time for such a victory, with a very good performance against a very good team, so I am very pleased. It was nice after the defeat against Arsenal to do that in the next game against a competitor. We did everything. We were compact and scored beautiful goals.

'We were lucky that the first chance was a goal, and then you raise your confidence. We also played quicker than usual and that depends on the confidence of your players. Also the opponent. Tottenham are a team who wants to play, therefore you have more time and space to play the game.' After a weekend when Chelsea and Manchester City dropped points, Van Gaal declared United in the race for second, but would not declare a late charge for the title. 'We go step by step, it's a rat race,' he said. 'We have made a big step but we have to go to Liverpool next, also a competitor of ours.' Rooney added: 'The first half was probably the best 45 minutes we've played this season. In the second half we didn't want to lose advantage of the three goals we had. We defended really well and made sure we've seen the game out. 'We knew it was a big game. With Manchester City losing and Southampton drawing it was a big game for us. We've taken the points off Tottenham, so it's a great three points for us.'","A video emerged of Wayne Rooney which appears to show him being knocked out by former team-mate Phil Bardsley .

"Gordon Strachan has told up and coming Scottish managers to get ready for periods of time when they will doubt their own ability to succeed. The Scotland national team boss was speaking at a press conference at the Scots' Mar Hall Hotel training base on the outskirts of Glasgow ahead of the forthcoming double-header against Northern Ireland and Gibraltar at Hampden Park. Watching Strachan's earlier training session were managers such as Dundee boss Paul Hartley, Alan Archibald of Partick Thistle, Hearts' Robbie Neilson and Norwich City boss Alex Neil, who are part of a group undertaking their UEFA Pro Licence.

Asked if he had any advice for the next generation of managers, the former Celtic, Southampton and Coventry boss did not sugar coat his reply. 'Get ready for a lot of long nights where you think you are useless,' he said. 'I'm serious. And you have to deal with that. There are a lot of players who I worked with who are now managers who phone me up. 'Now I know what Howard Wilkinson (his former boss at Leeds) felt like. I used to phone him a lot when I was in trouble. 'As a matter of fact, every time he picked up the phone he used to say 'what's up now?'

'You can only be called a good manager or a great manager, like Sir Alex Ferguson and those people, if you can hang in there for a long, long time. 'But it is a good way to learn. The best way to learn is being a manager and making mistakes.' Strachan took as much from the training session as the interested observers.

"Roy Hodgson picks his England squad on Thursday for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and a friendly against Italy. Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Rickie Lambert and Saido Berahino were named to face Scotland in November. Daniel Sturridge is fit again now too, but there are three new boys on the block. So what do the likes of Danny Ings, Charlie Austin and Harry Kane have to offer? Danny Ings . He’s a very astute and clever player, aware of what’s going on around him in midfield and around the penalty box. His movement and technical ability are good. Ings  looks to go in behind the defender and to face up and receive the ball. He has a bit of pace as well. Here is a player who will really flourish if he ends up at Liverpool, Arsenal or Manchester United because of the amount of chances he’ll the get there. He has a big future. Burnley striker Danny Ings (right) is a a very astute and clever player with a bit of pace as well . Charlie Austin . What people don’t appreciate about Charlie is that he’s scored 15 goals this season yet because QPR are fighting relegation, he’s not had that many chances. He is a born finisher, instinctive in the way that Gary Lineker or Ian Rush was and perhaps the best of the three in that regard. I was with him at QPR and Charlie knows he has to work on his game outside the box, in his positioning and movement. But he will do that, because he is committed learner and though he’s 25, you can see him improving over the next few years. QPR forward Charlie Austin has scored 15 Premier League goals this season, despite the club's struggles . Harry Kane . Harry’s probably not quite as good a finisher as Charlie, but his all-round game is better. He can play off the front, he can play the one right up the top. His movement is excellent and technically he looks a really good player. His finishing is much more clinical now and he has range, from the header he scored against Arsenal, to shots outside and inside the box. In general, if a player is good enough for the senior squad, I don’t see the sense in sending them back to the Under 21s. It’s unlikely Kane  will get much game time against Lithuania and Italy so he will probably go back to the U21s for the summer tournament. But once he has three or four senior games under his belt, there should be no going back. Harry Kane is the Premier League's form man - winning the January and February Player of the Month award . Verdict . I don’t think England have had this amount of players to choose from up front since I was manager. Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham, Ian Wright and Michael Owen meant the likes of as Robbie Fowler, Les Ferdinand and Andrew Cole weren’t first choice. Hodgson might have a similar scenario developing now.

"Chelsea took to Instagram on Saturday to back up their manager and attack the pundits who criticised their behaviour during the Champions League exit at the hands of PSG in midweek. Graeme Souness and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher branded Jose Mourinho's team 'a disgrace' after they surrounded the referee to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off during the 2-2 draw. But afterwards, Mourinho accused the pair of having short memories, pointing out both men's own on-field reputations. Jose Mourinho spikily replied to comments made by Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness . Chelsea players surround Bjorn Kuipers as the Dutch referee gives Zlatan Ibrahimovic his marching orders . And the club have put their weight behind his claims, publishing pictures of both Carragher and Souness confronting officials from years gone by.

Earlier this week Mourinho had hit out at both Souness and Carragher after the defeat to PSG on away goals. Every outfield Chelsea player except Oscar was involved in the mass protest during the PSG game . It was this tackle by the Swede on Oscar that had the Chelsea players swarming round the ref . ‘When Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness speak, it’s because they are having a problem for sure,' Mourinho said. 'Jamie stopped playing a couple of years ago and, in two years, he forgets everything he did on the pitch. Mr Souness also, but he stopped playing a long time ago. ‘I coached Benfica, I know a lot about him, so much about him. But I’m a certain kind of education, not just in football but in life, and I prefer to laugh.’ Carragher responded to the post on twitter, writing: 'I'm contesting a shocking penalty decision against Chelsea which the ref apologised for & Souey is backing his players like Jose does!!'","Jose Mourinho had accused pundits of forgetting what they did on pitch .

"Radamel Falcao left Manchester United's Carrington training base on Thursday, well aware that his chances to impress at his loan club have run out. The Colombian striker suffered an embarrassing demotion to United's Under 21 side this week and sources close to Falcao say he recognises that he made the wrong move when picking Old Trafford in the summer.

It was a stark contrast to his expressions on Tuesday night against Tottenham's Under 21 side, where Falcao looked surprised and upset to be pulled off after 71 minutes on his latest poor performance. And with Louis van Gaal appearing to show little belief in his deadline day signing, something else that sources close to Falcao have revealed the striker believes, he must have little hope of playing against the same club on Sunday. With wages of £300,000-a-week and an expected fee of close to his £40million release clause, United will not take up the option to sign Falcao and he will return to Monaco - although there are expected to be other suitors despite a dismal season in England.

On Sunday, however, he will lead the line at Everton as United begin the first of seven matches without top goalscorer Papiss Cisse, banned for his part in the shameful spitting incident with Manchester United’s Jonny Evans. But Carver is confident five-goal Perez can carry the scoring burden in Cisse’s absence and says he is not surprised by admiring eyes being cast from the Etihad. ‘I know for a fact there is interest in him,’ said Carver. ‘You go in coaches’ rooms after games and have a chat. A few people have spoken very highly of him, which is good. I had a good chat with Brian Kidd at Man City about him. ‘I’m not surprised by that. He’s a young lad and an exciting talent. Perez (bottom) has scored five goals for Newcastle and has attracted interest from Manchester City . Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared up to each other at St James' Park . ‘When we signed him we thought he would have a full season in the under-21 team developing. But he was thrown in at the deep end and he dealt with it.’ Perez was named Tenerife Sportsman of the Year this week having also collected best breakthrough player in Spain following his 16 goals in their second tier last term. But the frontman – who is being touted for a call-up to the senior Spain squad – is not concerned about the fuss surrounding his future. ‘It would be a mistake to start thinking about that now, it is too early. I’ve only been at Newcastle a few months and I am very happy. I continue to work as usual and I am in no rush,’ he said. Newcastle caretaker coach John Carver takes training ahead of facing Everton on Sunday afternoon . ‘I just think about helping the team and returning all the trust they have put in me. Everything else? If you keep working hard, sooner or later it will end up coming.’ Carver agrees. ‘I think it is best he stays here, absolutely,’ said the head coach. ‘He’s made the next step in his career and this is a fantastic place to continue that development. ‘I took him out of the firing line recently and I thought it was right to do so. ‘It has helped him having a bit of a break. There was an awful lot of pressure on this young lad coming from Tenerife and being thrown into our cauldron, as we know it is. ‘But I thought he dealt with it well and it's part of my job to deal with him and make sure he doesn't disappear into the wilderness.’","Ayoze Perez arrived for £1.6million in the summer from Tenerife .

"Real Madrid are hoping that a win against Levante on Sunday night will help them make peace with their fans, who have turned on the team after a recent poor run of form. Carlo Ancelotti's men have come under fierce criticism after squandering their lead at the top of La Liga, with Marca's front page on Sunday referring to the situation as a 'pressure cooker'. Levante are the visitors to the Bernabeu, in what AS have described as a 'trial run' for next week's El Clasico. The match at the Nou Camp on March 22 will go a long way to deciding this season's La Liga champions, and Ancelotti will be desperate to reclaim Madrid's spot at the top of the table. The front page of Marca leads with the headline, 'Pressure Cooker' ahead of Real Madrid's game on Sunday . Madrid face Levante at the Bernabeu on Sunday night, while Barcelona beat Eibar 2-0 on Saturday . There will be changes in the starting line-up for the Levante clash, the Spanish papers claim, with Keylor Navas expected to get the nod ahead of Iker Casillas. The Spanish veteran made a number of high-profile mistakes against Schalke in the Champions League last week. Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric are also expected to start, in order to get themselves ready for El Clasico. Marca carry a quote from Madrid boss Ancelotti, who has stated that his team are 'hurt, but won't let our heads drop'. Barcelona continued their good form on Saturday, comfortably beating Eibar 2-0. The win means that they have extended their lead at the top to four points - and it is up to Madrid to close the gap with victory on Sunday. In Italy, Juventus won 1-0 against Palermo, and are now gearing up for their Champions League game midweek . Morata scored the winning goal, and Tuttosport's headline (left) reads: 'Borussia, we're coming' Mundo Deportivo's front page hails the 'solid leaders', who came through the game ahead of a decisive week against Manchester City and then Real Madrid. They write that Lionel Messi was once again decisive, scoring both of his side's goals, one from the penalty spot and the other a 'great header'. Messi has taken his tally to 32 league goals for the season, overtaking rival Cristiano Ronaldo in the process. In Italy, much of the focus is on Juventus ahead of their Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund. Massimiliano Allegri's side beat Palermo 1-0 to 'send a message to Borussia', who they beat 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 game a fortnight ago. Elsewhere, Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini has labelled Yaya Toure his 'son', noting: 'With him, what an Inter!' There has been much speculation over the Ivorian's future at Manchester City, and Mancini has been honest in admitting his interest in the midfielder.","Real Madrid face Levante, needing a win to keep in touch with Barcelona .

"Gareth Bale rammed some of the ridiculous criticism he has received in recent weeks from Real Madrid supporters back down their throats with a first half double and the perfect goal celebration. The former Tottenham forward who scored 22 goals in 44 games in his first season at the club including strikes that won the Copa del Rey and Champions League final has had to put up with whistles in his own stadium and a fan poll that had 40 per cent of supporters calling for him to be dropped in recent weeks. When he put Real Madrid ahead on 18 minutes in the 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday night he made sure he left off some steam, covering his ears as he ran to the corner to give the flag a celebratory kick. Read back over Sportsmail's live coverage here. Host commentator . Thanks for following Sportsmail's live coverage of Real Madrid's 2-0 win over Levante. Big week of football coming up, starting with Swansea vs Liverpool - stick with MailOnline for all the updates. A drab second half is brought to the end by the referee. If only Karim Benzema had netted that ridiculous flick, eh? Anyway, Gareth Bale's seven-game run without scoring is over and he looks ready for next week's El Clasico, even if Cristiano Ronaldo was a bit out of sorts. Real Madrid move to within a point of Barcelona, and they are nine goals behind the Catalan club in terms of goal difference. Yeah, he's not scoring today. Marcelo puts in a cross, Bale slicks it on and Ronaldo shins the ball wide. Three minutes added on. Ronaldo elects to allow someone else to take a free-kick. This time it's Marcelo, he whips it in and it finds Hernandez but he wastes a header wide of the post. Oh, and Hernandez was just one of four Real players offside - the linesman spots it. Seconds later Nabil El Zhar flashes a shot well over the bar from the edge of the area, not that that statement will surprise Liverpool fans. Sergio Ramos pulls back Victor Casadesus. It's a yellow card for the Spaniard. Ronaldo still looking for that elusive goal, he cuts in from the left along the edge of the area, past two markers and fires in the shot but it's straight at goalkeeper Marino. Another change, Benzema gets a bit of a rest towards the end - with most people still gutted not to see his wondergoal effort go it - and is replaced by Javier Hernandez. Give the maestro a rest before El Clasico next week... Luka Modric comes off after completing 77 minutes and is replaced by Illarramendi. He might be the best player in the world but Ronaldo is taking a bit of a liberty here. First the lack of respect to Bale in the first half, and now he's running around demanding the ball. He gets it from Jese and then just loses the ball on the edge of the box. Obviously frustrated and not one for defensive responsibility, he stands with his hands on his hips. Kalu Uche off, Victor Casadesus on. Benzema plays in Bale and he fires at goal. Marino saves well but it escapes his grasp and Jese almost reaches it to tap in but the goalkeeper eventually gathers. There's four forwards for Real Madrid on the pitch now - looks like they're going to go with Ronaldo and Benzema up front as a pair, Jese on the left and Bale on the right as an extremely attacking front through. Ancelotti mixing things up. Wow! How do you describe that? Cristiano Ronaldo crosses from the right and Karim Benzema is completely unmarked. With the ball coming slightly behind him and around his midriff, he lifts his right heel and directs the ball on to the angle of post and crossbar. So close to a crazy goal. Absolute class and so, so ridiculous. Hopefully that will wake up this otherwise drab half. Nabir El Zhar (yes, the ex-Liverpool one) and Ruben Garcia replace Jose Luis Morales and Jordi Xumetra for Levante. Not much going on so far but Benzema fires over a half-volley seven minutes after the break. Real could do with a few more, they're nine goals behind Barcelona on the goal difference tally. Can Cristiano Ronaldo get himself a goal? And will Gareth Bale get his hat-trick? We'll find out in the next 45 minutes at the Bernabeu. Off we go. The Bernabeu crowd might be a bit more pleased with Bale, but team-mate Ronaldo certainly isn't. The Portuguese forward effectively set up the Welshman for both goals, albeit unintentionally, and was not best pleased. First, his acrobatic volley was cleared and Bale smashed in the rebound, with Ronaldo raising his arm in frustration even as Bale netted. Second, Bale deflected in Ronaldo's shot, which was heading wide, to make it 2-0, and the Ballon d'Or looked far from pleased, and it's not something that's gone unnoticed. Good start for Real Madrid. Two Gareth Bale goals - the second to the frustration of Cristiano Ronaldo - and they're 2-0 up. Keylor Navas has been a spectator in goal. That's Real sure of the win. A quick free-kick by Luka Modric plays Dani Carvajal in down the right, he cuts back to Cristiano Ronaldo who fires a shot across goal. It - decisively - deflects in off Gareth Bale and Real are 2-0 up. Ronaldo celebrates the strike but we're crediting that one to Bale. He's on a hat-trick now, unless the Ballon d'Or winner has a word at half-time. Well, of sorts. Morales cuts in from the left and tries to fire in a shot but it's blocked at close range. Real break but Benzema makes a wrong pas and the Bernabeu begins to boo. No pleasing these guys is there? They've done next to nothing so far but Levante are trying to play a bit, but there's just no intensity to their play Jose Luis Morales does well down the left but he can't get past his man and Real recover and are free to build up again. Moments later they look close to finding a gap in the Real defence but Pepe does well to clear away. Gareth Bale cuts back in from the right wing and it hits the chest of Simao to deflect on to the crossbar - not sure if the Welshman was aiming for a shot or cross but he's come close nonetheless. Bale also gets to the subsequent corner first but heads over. It's Real's 10th shot of the game (Levante have had none) and Cristiano Ronaldo almost makes it 2-0 to his side. He looks set for a tap-in in front of goal after Bale plays the ball across the six-yard line but Tono manages to get in with a last-ditch block to save Levante. Bale might have had the chance to silence his critics but Iker Casillas isn't quite so lucky as he sits on the bench. The Real captain got a less-than-warm reception from the crowd when his name was announced pre-match, as you can hear here: . Gareth Bale runs towards the Bernabeu crowd with his hands to his ears. Where are the boos now? After Cristiano Ronaldo's acrobatic volley was headed off the line, Bale slams in with a right-footed volley. It's 1-0 and Bale has his goal. Marino's having to be everywhere right now, although he probably knew it would be a busy night. This time it's Bale with the effort, he gets up to head Modric's corner goal-wards but the keeper makes a stunning diving save to keep it goalless. Karim Benzema has the ball in the net after he latches on to Marino's save from Lukas Modric's long shot, but the Frenchman is ruled offside by the linesman. Still 0-0. Cristiano Ronaldo is brought down 25 yards out and wins a free-kick. Six player wall...can he test Marino? No....it's hit the six-man wall. Here we go with another long-winded Real attack. Real not really breaking through their opponents in the last couple of minutes but they are well in control. Levante are effectively an eight-man defence and as soon as they break into the opposition half they give the ball away. Lovely flick from Gareth Bale over to Karim Benzema who cuts back to Ronaldo inside the box and he toe-pokes it towards the corner... but it hits the base of Diego Marino's post. A goal isn't far away. First chance for Gareth Bale to show what he can do. Decent early chance as he turns and volleys towards goal which arrows just wide of the top corner. We're underway at the Santiago Bernabeu. Before kick-off, a moment's reflection for former Real Madrid player Antonio Betancort who passed away today aged 78. It's bad enough having to play away against Real Madrid, but Levante have a dreadful record here and will likely just be hoping not to be on the end of a rout. The reverse fixture back in October ended 5-0 to Real, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring twice, and their past record at the Bernabeu makes grim reading too, looking from now back to 2008 their form here reads: 3-0, 5-1, 4-2, 2-0, 8-0 (yes, EIGHT), 5-2. Gareth Bale has no goals in his last nine games, so tonight is a big for him to change the fans' perceptions. Remember, we're only one week away from the big one: El Clasico. It's vital Real stay in touch. All the action here in 10 minutes. The big news for Real is that their famous front three of Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale all start - while Toni Kroos is rested. Oh, and of course Iker Casillas is dropped for Jesus Navas - although that seemed to be hinted by Carlo Ancelotti on Saturday. Here's the rest of their line-up plus the Levante XI: . Real Madrid (4-3-3): Navas; Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo; Modric, Silva, Isco; Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo. Levante (4-2-3-1): Marino; Lopez, Navarro, Ramis, Tono; Camarasa, Simao; Xumetra, Barral, Morales; Uche.","Real Madrid face Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday night .

"Jose Mourinho has come out swinging after a week in which Chelsea suffered a desperate Champions League exit, by declaring he is still the special one. Days after facing a barrage of criticism for the manner of Chelsea’s defeat by Paris Saint-Germain, Mourinho has hit back by bragging that there are a mere handful of managers around the world who can measure up to him. Jose Mourinho insists he is still the special one despite Champions League exit at hands of PSG . ‘When I compare myself with other managers I see just a few that are with me in terms of success,’ he said. ‘The others I see a huge distance.’ It was a defiant broadside from the colourful Portuguese boss, who vowed that Wednesday’s disaster against ten-man PSG — in which his team were branded ‘babies’ — will simply spark a Premier League title charge. Chelsea players were described as babies after surrounding Bjorn Kuipers during Champions League clash . Porto (2002–2004) Primeira Liga: 2002–03, 2003–04 . Taça de Portugal: 2002–03 .

It’s the main target. If you can win that, I think it’s fantastic.’ Speaking before Burnley beat Manchester City on Saturday, Mourinho added: ‘I think we need nine victories; 11 matches. If our direct opponents lose a couple of points, then you need eight victories and one draw or something like that.’ Asked about the prospect of winning a third Champions League title, having already won it at Porto and Inter, Mourinho said: ‘It is wrong to assume that. People are too worried about me. They don’t know what my happiness is. ‘My happiness, first of all, is when I compare myself with the other managers. This is not a fight with them and I have lots of respect for all of them. 'But in the Premier League, who is European champion? Me and Van Gaal. In the Premier League, how many has won it twice or more than twice? Mr Wenger and myself. How many has won every competition in this country?

"Sean Dyche reacted brilliantly to a reporter accidentally questioning him on Burnley's 'title fight' after their 1-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday.

"Dick Advocaat has a warning for Sunderland’s under-performing players – ‘If you don’t put it in for me I’ll be on the pitch letting you know’.

When they lost the ball up front, the ball went, and five players were walking back instead of running back. ‘This is not possible.

That means that something is wrong.’ Advocaat said he was disappointed with the Sunderland player's reaction after they conceded . Sunderland are one place and one point above the relegation zone . Advocaat has never been relegated during a 28-year managerial career – and he doesn’t intend to make that a first on Wearside. ‘I have never been relegated and I always have the feeling that I will never go down,’ he said. ‘So I don’t really want to talk about that. I have been close, but that was when I was a very young manager. I started at SVV when I was 36 and we were champions in one of the lower leagues. We had a difficult season the following year, but we survived in the last game.’ Advocaat has just nine games to save Sunderland from the drop and is confident his influence can make a difference.

They have to do that. ‘If we are to going to win games, they have to do that.

"Sebastian Vettel laughed off Nico Rosberg’s claim that he hopes Ferrari can catch Mercedes during a spiky press conference after Sunday's Australian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton, who romped to victory at the season-opening race in Melbourne, and team-mate Rosberg, finished more than half-a-minute clear of Vettel to seal an utterly dominant weekend for the world champions. After the race, Rosberg said he hoped Ferrari would be able to bring the challenge to Mercedes, with he and Hamilton expected to dominate this term having won 16 of the 19 races in 2014.

If you do come a bit closer, that would be awesome for everybody.’ Vettel points to the crowd as he celebrates his first Ferrari podium on his debut for the famous Italian team . The four-time world champion finished the best part of 30 seconds behind Hamilton and Rosberg on Sunday . Former Red Bull driver Vettel then called on his German compatriot to give him a guided tour of the Mercedes garage at the next race in Malaysia. ‘You can come if you want, we can invite you,’ said Rosberg. ‘OK, thank you for the invite, I’ll come,' Vettel replied. The spat continued when Vettel said it was ‘a shame’ that his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen didn’t finish the race – the Finn was forced to retire after his pit-crew failed to properly attach his rear-left tyre during his second stop. ‘You find it a shame that your team-mate didn’t finish?’ quizzed Rosberg, seemingly still irked by Vettel’s earlier interrogation. ‘Yes. I don’t know how much you like each other,’ answered Vettel in reference to Rosberg’s relationship with Hamilton, which descended into chaos at times last season as they vied for the title. ‘But Kimi and myself we get along, so I think it is a shame,' Vettel added. Hamilton saw off the challenge from Rosberg to win the opening race of the new season . VIDEO Hamilton cruises to victory in Australian GP . Q: Question to both Lewis and Nico. We’ve seen dominance in qualifying, dominance in the race today. Is this it for the season? A two-horse race between you two for the title or can you envisage any of your rivals making in-roads into your supremacy? LH: I think Nico was just explaining… I didn’t know, I didn’t see the times or anything but I think the Ferraris have taken a huge step forward. It’s clear they’ve made one of the biggest steps. So we definitely cannot back off because I’m sure they’re going to be pushing. And I anticipate we might have a good fight with them at some stage this year… . Nico? NR: I hope we can have a good fight. That would be awesome. I think the next couple of races we’re going to be leading the way for sure, and we’re going to try and keep it that way, but we know it would be good if they can come a bit closer, as long as they don’t come too close… . SV: Be honest. Do you really hope so? Seriously? You finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it’s going to be closer? So you hope you slow down? Is that what you’re saying? NR: I hope that you can give us a challenge! Because it’s important for the sport and for the fans. And I do think about the show. Half of me – or a part of me – thinks about the show because I want to give people a great time at home watching on TV or at the track. If you do come a bit closer, that would be awesome for everybody. SV: First suggestion, if you don’t mind, I think your garage becomes public for Malaysia and everyone can have a look. No? I’m joking. NR: You can come if you want, we can invite you… . SV: OK, thank you for the invite, I’ll come. NR: Friday Malaysia, OK. SV: Engineers’ room? Debrief, I’ll be there. Q: Sebastian, among the races to come, which one do you feel will be the one that is easier for you, for Ferrari to catch up to the Mercedes? I think Malaysia will be difficult but what about Bahrain or Shanghai? SV: Easy, for us? I think if you look at the gap, nowhere is going to be easy. I think we have to focus on ourselves, make sure that what we learned this weekend we’re able to take into the next races. The most important thing now is that if we finish – we did finish right behind Mercedes today. We need to confirm that in the next race, that’s the priority number one, so we need to make sure that I was not just a one-off. We improve reliability. As I said, Kimi didn’t finish, which is a shame. We could have scored a lot more points today. NR: ... that you find it a shame that your teammate didn’t finish? SV: Yes. I don’t know how much you like each other but Kimi and myself we get along, so I think it is a shame. NR: I though as a racing driver you might like it that you have a couple of points advantage over him now. I don’t want to get you off the foot there, sorry. Oops. Look at him, look at him go... SV: I can see your point. No, no. I can see that at the moment, where we are, we want to make sure we catch you guys and to do that we both need to score. Yes, I honestly think so and I honestly didn’t want to see the second car not finishing today. NR: Because I’m ready for it now, you caught me a bit off guard before but now I’m ready for it! Teen sensation Max Verstappen missed out on finishing in the points in his grand prix bow. Verstappen, 17, the youngest driver in F1 history, was running in ninth before mechanical gremlins struck. He was forced to park his Toro Rosso after 32 laps, which, in a remarkable coincidence, was the same number his father Jos completed before retiring on his 1994 F1 debut in Brazil. Lewis Hamilton’s win, the 34th of his GP career, means he has won seven of the last eight races. It leaves him five shy of Vettel, fourth on the all-time list, and seven adrift of boyhood hero Ayrton Senna. It is understood that Susie Wolff, the British racer, will not deputise for Valtteri Bottas in Malaysia if the Finn fails to recover from his back problem. ‘Susie is our test driver, not our reserve driver,’ said the team’s boss Claire Williams.","Sebastian Vettel issued spiky response when Nico Rosberg claimed he hoped Ferrari would be able to catch frontrunners Mercedes .

"German playmaker Mesut Ozil has called on his Arsenal team-mates to believe they have what it takes to produce their own miracle result in Monte Carlo on Tuesday night. The Gunners' hopes of progress to the quarter-finals of Europe's elite club competition are all but over following a disappointing 3-1 defeat in the first leg at the Emirates Stadium last month. No team has recovered from more than a single-goal deficit going into an away leg in the Champions League era. Mesut Ozil believes Arsenal can beat Monaco by three goals to reach the Champions League quarter finals . No club have ever overturned such a deficit, but the German says his team should take heart from recent form . Arsenal were in fine form to beat West Ham on Saturday, with Olivier Giroud playing a part in all three goals . Ozil says the Gunners can carry their momentum into the midweek tie and progress past Monaco . Monaco beat nine-man Bastia 3-0 in Ligue 1 on Friday night to extend their formidable defensive record with only seven goals conceded from the last 22 games. Leonardo Jardim's side did not let in a goal in three home ties during the Champions League group stages, but despite all the odds being stacked against the Barclays Premier League side Ozil feels Arsenal are well worth a gamble. 'When you believe in yourselves, a positive energy grows that you can achieve your aims. In football, things that may look unlikely can happen. I know that if we believe in ourselves and utilise our potential, we can still go through,' Ozil told Arsenal Player. 'We need to score three goals and Monaco are a team that play defensively, but we have to take initiative and score the first goal as quickly as possible to boost our confidence. Ozil and Giroud cut a dejected figure while Arsenal were being beaten at home by Monaco last month . The Gunners will need to overturn a two-goal deficit against a team who rarely concede . But Ozil is confident that they have enough going forward, and can win if they seize the early initiative . 'It is going to be difficult to score three times because they have defended well in the tournament so far, but if you look at our past matches and the way we played against Manchester United (in the FA Cup quarter-final) last week, I think there's a chance we can still progress. 'When you look at the Manchester United game, we controlled it and deserved to win the game, that just shows that if we convert what the manager encourages us to do into the games, we can achieve a lot.' Ozil added: 'We know the quality we have in our team - there are world-class players here. 'Look at our options in attack, where a variety of players can and do score goals. That's a positive for us and we will make sure to give everything in Monaco to advance to the next round.' Ozil has returned from three months out with a knee injury looking a much-stronger player, covering plenty of ground. Ozil was taken off early on Saturday, along with Alexis Sanchez, to preserve them for midweek in Monaco . The German, who was out with injury for much of this season, has come back stronger and fitter than ever . The 26-year-old former Real Madrid midfielder feels he is benefiting from his new training regime. 'I wanted to be as fit as possible when I returned after my injury. I worked on the upper part of my body as well as paying attention to my nutrition,' he said. 'I underwent treatment to get myself fit as soon as possible and to prevent the injury from returning. I am on a good path now. 'I worked really hard and I think it shows in training and in matches that I am fresher. 'I am really happy to be back on the pitch and able to do what I most love.' Tuesday night will see Wenger return to the Stade Louis II for the first time since his successful spell in charge which saw them win the 1988 French league title and Coupe de France in 1991, as well as reaching the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup final and semi-finals of the Champions League.","Arsenal trail Monaco 3-1 after Champions League last 16 first leg .

"Chris Froome is scheduled for an early-season duel with his three main rivals for the 2015 Tour de France title - Alberto Contador, Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali - at the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race later this month. Tinkoff-Saxo boss Oleg Tinkov had hoped the quartet would line-up in all three Grand Tours - of France, Italy and Spain. That idea did not take off, but now Tinkov has his wish of seeing the four race each other before the Tour after organisers RCS Sport announced their participation in the Italy-based Tirreno-Adriatico race, which takes place from March 11 to 17. Chris Froome celebrates on the podium after winning the 61st Tour of Andalusia on February 21, 2015 . Froome will face his main rivals for the Tour de France in Italy; one of which is Vincenzo Nibali (pictured) The prospect of 2014 Tour de France winner Nibali competing is by no means certain, though, after the UCI, cycling's world governing body, asked its licence commission to withdraw the licence of his Astana team. If Nibali does take part it will be the first time the dominant four Grand Tour winners have all raced in the same WorldTour event, RCS Sport said. Contador (Tinkoff-Saxo) is the defending champion of the 'Race of the Two Seas' and has won all three Grand Tours, as has Nibali, who won the 2012 and 2013 Tirreno-Adriatico. Froome, the 2013 Tour de France winner, will lead a Team Sky squad which is also slated to include Elia Viviani. The Italian will contest the sprints against Mark Cavendish (Etixx-QuickStep) and Marcel Kittel (Team Giant-Alpecin), who has taken the Briton's mantle as the world's top sprinter in recent seasons.

The 25 time Tour de France stage winner is 30 in May and has seen Marcel Kittel emerge as the dominant sprinter in recent seasons but his win in Belgium will certainly help his cause if he is to stay at Etixx-QuickStep.","Mark Cavendish triumphed in Sunday's one-day Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne .

"Bayern Munich fielded a non-German goalkeeper in the Bundesliga for the first time since 1988, as Pepe Reina replaced Manuel Neuer in a 4-0 win over Werder Bremen. The former Liverpool man signed for Bayern in the summer, and his debut in the German top flight also makes him the first goalkeeper to play in all four of Europe's top leagues. Robert Lewandowski took the plaudits, scoring twice as Bayern showed no signs of letting up at the top of the Bundesliga, swatting Werder Bremen aside with ease in a bad-tempered match that threatened to get out of hand. Pepe Reina became Bayern Munich's first non-German goalkeeper in the Bundesliga since 1988 . The Bayern squad celebrate after their impressive 4-0 win over Werder Bremen on Saturday . Reina directs his team-mates as he became the first goalkeeper ever to play in all four of Europe's top leagues . The game threatened to boil over after a series of strong challenges saw the referee dish out yellow cards . Werder were undone by three goals from counter-attacks and a David Alaba free-kick, but did enough to rile the visitors to the point that defender Jerome Boateng, one of six players booked, became involved in an argument with a ball boy. Runaway leaders Bayern, who have 64 points from 25 games, are now 14 clear of second-placed Wolfsburg who host Freiburg on Sunday afternoon. Pep Guardiola's side, who have scored 34 goals in their last eight games in all competitions and thumped Werder 6-0 earlier in the season, went ahead in the 24th minute when Thomas Muller curled the ball in from the edge of the area following a counter-attack. Despite missing Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben through injury, the leaders were as clinical as ever and Alaba chipped in a free kick in the last minute of the first half to make it 2-0. Reina tries to calm down team-mate Mehdi Benatia as tempers flare during the match in Bremen, Germany . Thomas Muller (centre) celebrates after netting the opening goal of the game; his 12th goal of the season . David Alaba scored the second goal, a wonderful free-kick in the dying moments of the first half . Pep Guardiola (left) has now taken his side 14 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table . Werder had a goal disallowed for handball by Sebastian Proedl in the second half, although the Austrian appeared to be pushed by Boateng, and the game turned ugly with several late tackles and heated exchanges between the players. Almost inevitably Werder were caught on the break when Lewandowski grabbed two goals in the final quarter of an hour, both set up by Mueller after lightning attacks. 'We tried everything and attacked with courage for part of the game,' said Werder coach Viktor Skrypnyk. 'Overall it wasn't a bad performance, at least it was better than the 6-0 defeat.' Robert Lewandowski (centre) and Muller celebrate as Bayern brushed Werder Bremen aside with ease . Lewandowski heads home his first - and Bayern's third - of the match... he later grabbed another to make it 4-0 . Muller (centre) screams in celebration after opening the scoring for Bayern Munich away at Bremen .

"Chelsea are 110 years old: and they look every day of it, battling towards a third Premier League title under Jose Mourinho. Six points clear with a game in hand hardly constitutes a crisis. Mourinho would certainly have bought that at the start of the season, any manager would. Yet it is hard, hard going, for a team that once seemed so assured. Southampton had the better of the first-half here, and all Chelsea’s pressure could not conjure a winner after half-time. Click here to read Martin Samuel's full match report . Host commentator . Chelsea miss the chance to go eight points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League table as Southampton claim a point at Stamford Bridge. And Koeman's side were worthy of the point as they impressed throughout the 90 minutes. Costa put his side in the lead, however his effort was cancelled out when the Saints were awarded a first-half penalty which Tadic converted. Azpilicueta came close to scoring a late winner however Forster was able to beat the ball away for a corner. Terry then almost gets on the scoresheet with a driven effort at goal, however he is unable to find a way past Forster. Pelle has just played a delightful lobbed pass to Mane but the Senegal international is unable to get the ball under control when going through on goal. Remains 1-1 at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea have just five more minutes to open up an eight-point lead over Manchester City. The Blues still have another game in hand over the Premier League champions so it's not all doom and gloom for Mourinho's men. Pelle has eight minutes to try to score a winner for his side. Meanwhile Willian is replaced by Cuadrado after hobbling off injured. With both sides having terrific records when it comes to keeping out the opposition I think the next goal will win this game. Chelsea look more likely to grab a winner as Southampton have been pushed back during the second half. There's just under 12 minutes left at Stamford Bridge. Hazard calls Forster into action with a quick fire shot. However the England stopper stands tall to deny the Belgium international. Tadic and Davis off, Djuricic and Ward-Prowse on . Cahill has been cautioned for yet another foul on Mane. The Senegal international has been in impressive this afternoon. Koeman will be thinking his side may be able to nick all three points. Pelle is warming up on the Stamford Bridge touchline. Long has led the line well but Koeman may look to freshen things up. Mane continues to cause problems with his blistering pace. This time it was Ivanovic who hacked Mane down as he was running through on goal. Wanyama also goes into Dean's book for a late foul. Mourinho brought in Cuadrado during the January transfer window to improve his wide options but the Colombia international hasn't really been handed the opportunities to impress. Today may just be the day for Cuadrado to prove his worth. Costa came close to grabbing his second goal of the match. The Spain international, who was involved in a tussle with Fonte, tried to poke home a cross by Willian but his effort hit the woodwork. Mourinho has decided not to risk the chance of Matic seeing red as he has replaced him with Ramires. Chelsea have started the second half in lively fashion. Their flair players are linking up much better than they were during the latter stages of the first. Sportsmail's Graham Poll believes Matic should have been sent off the foul on Mane. Matic was lucky not have been given a yellow card for a clumsy challenge on Mane. Dean appeared to reach into pocket before changing his mind. Chelsea played some nice football in the early stages of today's match. Costa's goal came after an intricate move which led to Ivanovic crossing into the box. Chelsea have looked extremely lacklustre since conceding. Matic deserved to be penalised for his foul on Mane despite Chelsea's protests. The home side could have also been awarded a penalty during the first half when Ivanovic was fouled inside the area. Mourinho will be weighing up his options ahead of the interval. Both Fabregas and Oscar have failed to make any real impact on today's game so far. Ramires, who failed to impress in midweek, and Cuadrado are both viable options from the bench. Koeman appears to have made the right decision in picking Long over Pelle. Long's pace is causing Terry and Cahill problems and his link up play with Mane has been exceptional thus far. The Saints look the more likely side to score the next goal. After a tricky first five minutes when it looked like Willian was going to run riot, Koeman's side have settled down and look a real threat on the counter attack. Mane has been cautioned for a late foul on Ivanovic. Chelsea could have received a penalty of their own. Ivanovic appeared to be clipped by Tadic while the right back was making his way into the penalty box. Mourinho will not be happy with Dean's decision. Tadic slots home via the foot of Courtois to level the scoreline at Stamford Bridge. Matic, who received a yellow card after being penalised by Mike Dean, appeared to win the ball but went through the back of Mane. Southampton have been awarded a penalty. Matic made a lunging challenge on Mane. Costa came into today's game level with Manchester City's Sergio Aguero as the joint highest goalscorer with 17 goals. However the Spain international's goal puts him in the lead. Southampton go up the other end in hope of getting back on to level terms. Mane shoots at goal but Courtois manages to get down to palm away his effort. And there you have it. Ivanovic crosses the ball into the box from the right and Costa has the easy task of nodding into the net. Koeman will be wondering why he was allowed to rise above his side's defence without being challenged. The Premier League's meanest defence will have to find a way of keeping Diego Costa quiet. Costa has had a remarkable first season in England - with the former Atletico Madrid man scoring 17 league goals. Brazilian playmaker Willian has looked extremely lively during the early exchanges. He has popped up on the right and through the middles to cause Southampton's defence problems. The likes of Willian, Oscar and Hazard have shown some neat early touches. Willian just ran through the middle before laying the ball onto Azpilicueta however his shot went over the bar. Chelsea and Southampton have excellent records when it comes to keeping out the opposition. Koeman's side have conceded just 20 Premier League goals while the Blues have let in just two more than their opponents. Ronald Koeman: 'It is always a bad time to face Chelsea because they are the strongest in the Premier League. 'It is a great opportunity for Chelsea after Man City's loss against Burnley and we have to stop them. We have to be patient and good defending will be important for today.' Chelsea seem to enjoy playing in front of their own fans. They have not lost a home match in the Premier League this season - with their only defeat at Stamford Bridge coming against Bradford in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Jose Mourinho: 'I'm not like the wind. I have stability in my relationship with the players. I trust my team. This is why I have gone with 10 of the 11 players which started against PSG.' Cesc Fabregas came in for criticism after Chelsea's defeat by PSG and he has a history of petering out in the second half of the season. Read the evidence here: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2991402/Cesc-Fabregas-history-fading-second-half-season-Chelsea-seen-slump-coming.html . John Terry: 'We came in for a lot of criticism after the PSG game and rightly so. 'If someone would have said at the start of the season that we would have won the Capital One Cup and where we are in the league then we would have bitten your hand off.' Chelsea fans turned up in their droves early on to get a glimpse of the players as they left the team coach. Let's see if the likes of John Terry, Eden Hazard and Co will be able to get out of first gear after stalling against PSG. If you are thinking about making a late trip up to Stamford Bridge without a matchday ticket then you best turn back as today's match is a sell out.

"Kevin Pietersen has been in talks with Surrey ‘for several weeks’ about a possible return to county cricket after approaching senior figures at the ECB about a shock international comeback before new chairman Colin Graves was appointed. The 34-year-old batsman’s hopes of an England return are gaining momentum, with Surrey seriously interested in re-signing the maverick star provided he is released from his Indian Premier League contract. Sportsmail understands Pietersen, currently exiled from the England squad after being sacked by team managing director Paul Downton, has been talking to Surrey’s director of cricket Alec Stewart, who is known to be open to him re-signing if he becomes available for all three formats - and not just Twenty20 cricket as he has been in the past. Kevin Pietersen has been in talks with Surrey  about a possible return as he plans an England comeback . Pietersen is willing to turn his back on the Indian Premier League in order to represent England . The batsman has been talking to Surrey’s director of cricket Alec Stewart - who is open to his return . It emerged on Saturday that Pietersen’s IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad are unlikely to object to releasing the star, leaving the unlikely prospect of Pietersen forgoing the IPL to play in the County Championship second division this summer in a bid to resurrect his England career. With incoming chairman Graves showing an appetite for significant regime change at the ECB, he has told Pietersen he will be considered for England selection again if he scores heavily in county cricket. It is understood Pietersen  first made contact with the ECB before Graves appointment was announced last month. ‘There will be a change of scenery at board level with the ECB and I’ve always expressed my desire to play for England again if I get the opportunity,’ Pietersen told Fox News on Saturday. Pietersen, pictured in 2008, would have to repair his relationship with England boss Peter Moores . ‘It seems encouraging but I’ve obviously got a few steps that I’ve got to climb. It just makes perfect sense to explore different things, that’s what I’m doing. I’ve still got more decisions to make - it’s the weekend now so nobody will be picking up their phones, but Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday it’ll be very exciting hopefully.’ Downton’s decision to sack Pietersen following last winter’s crushing 5-0 Ashes whitewash was welcomed by senior players in the dressing room who were further angered by the star’s autobiography. The relative paucity of Pietersen’s current IPL deal - which at £205,000 is worth barely 20 per cent of any of his previous deals - is understood to be a factor in his willingness to return to the grind of county cricket. At the centre of his attempt to return is the imminent departure of ECB chairman Giles Clarke, who clashed repeatedly with Pietersen following his requests for special treatment over his release for IPL duty. Pietersen's England future lies in the hands of new ECB chairman Colin Graves . England’s players would resist Pietersen’s return but their position has been weakened by their dire form since he was sacked. ‘They’d just have to suck it up if he does come back,’ said one insider on Saturday. If Pietersen - who has a debilitating knee condition - does re-sign for Surrey he would have just three County Championship games to prove himself ahead of England’s first Test of the summer against New Zealand at Lord’s on May 21 before the Ashes later in the summer. England name their squad for the Test tour of West Indies on Wednesday, with injury doubts hanging over Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, while Jonathan Trott is in line for a recall.","Kevin Pietersen has been in talks with Surrey 'for several weeks'

"Wilfried Zaha was happy to take one for the team after the Crystal Palace winger was involved in a nasty collision with the post as he opened the scoring against QPR on Saturday. The 22-year-old slid in at the back stick to turn home Yannick Bolasie's low cross knowing that he was on course to crash into the upright. 'I knew Bolasie was going to push it down the line, we've been doing it in training,' Zaha said during his post-match interview on BT Sport. Wilfired Zaha slid in at the back post to turn home Bolasie's low cross to give Palace a first-half lead . The 22-year-old beat  QPR full back Yun Suk-Young to poke the ball home from close range . Zaha's momentum took him and Puncheon crashing into the post as both Palace players required treatment . 'I had to get on the end of it, so if it meant colliding with the post, I had to. I was just glad to get the goal. 'I just got to do the right thing and ice it because it will definitely hurt tomorrow, but no pain, no gain.' After Palace beat Saturday's opponents 3-1 at Selhurst Park Zaha refused to get carried away as Alan Pardew's side close in on the top half of the table.

"England may be pondering a recall for Jonathan Trott but Yorkshire openers Adam Lyth and Alex Lees are ready and waiting to answer the call should selectors opt for new blood in the West Indies. England play three Tests in the Caribbean next month, where they will hope to shake off the ignominy of their woeful World Cup campaign. The identity of captain Alastair Cook's batting partner is likely to be one of the most vexed questions during selection meetings this week, with incumbent Sam Robson on shaky ground and Trott reportedly being considered for the first time since departing the 2013/14 Ashes with a stress-related condition. Jonathan Trott is reportedly being considered for an England recall ahead of West Indies tour . Yorkshire batsmen Adam Lyth (left) and Alex Lees are ready and willing to provide top order cover . He made his name as a No 3 but with another Yorkshire batsman, Gary Ballance, having made that slot his own, Trott is being considered for a promotion. Even if the 33-year-old travels, England may be tempted to take top-order cover and the title-winning pairing are first in line. Lyth was the top scorer in Division One of the LV= County Championship last summer, making 1489 runs and scoring six centuries, while 21-year-old Lees made 971 runs is rated as one of the country's brightest prospects. 'I feel like I've had a good winter with England Lions and hopefully I get the telephone call which I think I thoroughly deserve,' Lyth told Sportsmail. 'I'm looking forward to what might come for me. You can see how many people in recent years have gone on from playing Lions cricket to representing England and hopefully I can be the next one. Lees and Lyth were instrumental in winning the LV County Championship with Yorkshire last year . Trott has not been selected by England since departing the 2013/14 Ashes with a stress related condition . 'If that's not the case all I can do is keep scoring runs for Yorkshire.' Lyth and Lees are an unusual study in partners as rivals - as well as batting together throughout the county season they also played for the Lions in South Africa over the winter. Even now they are leading rival Yorkshire teams in an inter-club friendly in Abu Dhabi, but their relationship remains strong. 'Of course I get on really well with Alex and if he gets the nod I'll give him a pat on the back and say well done, but I obviously hope it's me,' added Lyth. Captain Eoin Morgan faces the press after England's disastrous exit from the Cricket World Cup . England vice captain Jos Buttler looks dejected as he leaves the field following defeat by Bangladesh . Lees is aware of the interest he has attracted as a stylish young opener, but is attempting to remain on an even keel as speculation over a Test call builds. 'I know I've had a good 18 months or so but I've got to keep knocking on the door and getting those runs,' he told PA. 'Personally the talk doesn't affect me, positive or negative, because people are always going to have their opinion on you and you just have to focus on your game. 'There is a spot with England and there's a few players in the mix. I think there will be an opportunity for somebody this year. 'It's quite refreshing that both me and Lythy are in the mix, we can really push each other on to be our best. 'That's good for us and hopefully it's good for Yorkshire.'","Yorkshire batsmen Adam Lyth and Alex Lees may be selected for England's three Test tour of West Indies .

"While many have not been aware of the decade-long tradition at Delta Airlines, a heart-warming video shows one of the tributes performed by bag handlers as a fallen soldier and his dog are returned home. As the unidentified K9 soldier's flag-draped casket is taken off a plane at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Delta staff are seen standing as they salute  on the tarmac during the ceremony. In the video, which was originally posted in April 2013, but has resurfaced touching many hearts, a smaller casket is also shown as the military animal is honored during the tribute. Scroll down for video . While many have not been aware of the decade-long tradition at Delta Airlines, a heart-warming video shows one of the tributes performed by bag handlers as a fallen soldier and his dog are returned home (above scenes from the tribute in 2013 at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport) In the video, which was originally posted in 2013, but has resurfaced touching many hearts, a smaller casket is also shown as the military animal is honored during the tribute (above Delta pilots shake hands with members of the Honor Guard service) The soldier and his bomb-sniffing dog were reportedly killed by an improvised explosive device, and the staff, both carefully handling their caskets and saluting, are a group of volunteers from the Delta Honor Guard service. During the moving February 2013 ceremony for the K9 soldier and his military dog, bag handlers are lined up holding flags behind the carrier transporting the caskets from the belly of the plane. There are flags represented for each branch of service as well as an American flag in the center, which are held at a 45 degree angle as the caskets emerge and are lowered, and a prayer is read before they are physically moved to a special flag-painted cart by the staff. Several other staff are seen observing the ceremony nearby during the rainy day, as travelers are seen in windows above filming and observing as well.

Two military personnel and what appears to be two Delta pilots then shake the hands of each flag holder before the touching tribute ends. Ceremonies like this are held by volunteers for veterans and active military personnel who were killed in action, according to an earlier report from the AJC. In 2010, it was reported that five to six ceremonies were held each week on both departing and arriving flights after a former Delta bag handler and military veteran, Thomas Schenk, started the effort in 2005.

While McConnell is not a veteran himself, his father was one and his son served in the Air Force in Afghanistan - so his involvement in the service, for this and among other reasons, is meaningful to him. The women and men of the employee-led Honor Guard, with several having served in the Armed Forces, have helped transport home more than 3,000 remains through Atlanta's airport, McConnell said in a report last year.

"A limp and lifeless Queens Park Rangers were destroyed by Crystal Palace, leaving their Barclays Premier League future severely in doubt. In a first half of utter domination the home side went three goals ahead with only three shots on target, while QPR failed to muster a single one. Already three points adrift of safety ahead of kick-off, QPR manager Chris Ramsey knew how imperative it was to get something from this game. His players did not respond. Joel Ward wheels away in celebration after finding the bottom corner with a well-placed effort to make it 3-0 to Crystal Palace . Ward gets his hot away just before QPR midfielder Sandro can get a block in as Palace raced into a 3-0 first-half lead . Ward heads towards team-mate Wilfried Zaha, who set up the goal with a brilliant run and pass . Crystal Palace (4-4-1-1): Speroni 6; Ward 7.5, Dann 7, Delaney 7, Kelly 7; Zaha 8.5 (Mariappa 57 6), Ledley 7, McArthur 7.5, Bolasie 8; Puncheon 7 (Gayle 55 6.5); Murray 6.5 (Sanogo 80).

Subs not used: McCarthy, Hoilett, Zamora, Grego-Cox . Booked: Sandro, Onuoha, Henry . Scorer(s): Phillips 83 . Manager: Chris Ramsey 4 . Referee: Lee Mason . Attendance: 24,886 . Wilfried Zaha terrorised the QPR defence down the Palace right. CLICK HERE to see more from Sportsmail's MATCH ZONE . The first came after 21 minutes, Yannick Bolasie bursting down the left, easily past 19-year-old right-back Darnell Furlong, and sending a low ball across the box which Wilfried Zaha was able to slide in at the back post. He was almost split in two by the upright in the process, and was eventually substituted in the second half, given a standing ovation by the adoring Selhurst Park crowd for netting his first goal since making a permanent move back to south London in January. ‘If it meant colliding with the post, I had to get my goal,’ said Zaha, who had gingerly limped off, afterwards. ‘It will definitely hurt, but no pain, no gain. ‘We’ve been talking all week about getting into the box so as soon as Yannick got the ball I knew I had to get in there and get on the end of it.’ It took another 20 minutes for the second, Bolasie again simply out-pacing Furlong down the left and crossing low again. This time goalkeeper Rob Green got a hand to the ball but could not divert it out of the path of James McArther who finished into the open net. Matt Phillips unleashed a ferocious strike from 40 yards that found the top corner to pull a goal back for the visitors . Phillips' effort dipped and swerved past Julian Speroni but it was too little too late for Rangers, who fell to another away defeat . Phillips grabs the ball in a hurry as he makes his way back to the centre spot as QPR sense a late comeback . Bolasie’s relentless dismantling of teenager Furlong was painful to watch, like a grown man putting a puppy into a sack and repeatedly kicking it. But he was afforded some respite, at least, for the third, just 60 seconds later this time. Palace probed down the other flank, Zaha using skill to outwit a few QPR players before passing into Joel Ward who took a touch before bending the ball through a flurry of players and bouncing agonisingly into the far left of goal. Furlong, playing only his third game for QPR, was hooked at half-time, Clint Hill coming in at centre-back and Nedum Onuoha moving to right-back to try to deal with Bolasie’s threat. QPR manager Chris Ramsey claimed it was due to injury. ‘Darnell came off for no other reason that he’s got a bad calf,’ he said. ‘His calf stiffened up and it wouldn’t be fair to the boy to keep the boy on there hobbling.’ Ward is congratulated by team-mates James McArthur and Scott Dann after firing Palace into an unassailable lead against QPR . James McArthur doubled the home side's lead five minutes before half-time after tapping Yannick Bolasie's low cross into an empty net . McArthur leaps to his feet in celebration as he heads towards the provider Bolasie as Palace took a firm a grip on proceedings . Midfielder McArthur points to his shin with a smile on his face appearing to suggest the ball hadn't gone in off his boot . If Darnell was the puppy of the side, his team-mates finally produced some bite in the second half, even if it was all too late. They finally got an effort on target, after 72 minutes. From who else but Charlie Austin? The striker reached a cross first but could only direct at tame header down the middle which Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni held. Then, out of nowhere, they pulled one back in the final 10 minutes, with one of the strikes of the season. Matt Phillips picked the ball up in the middle of the park and took a touch before belting an effort over Speroni and into the top left corner from 40 yards. With one minute remaining of the 90 he almost struck again, this time hitting a first-time drive from slightly to the right of goal, but Speroni was alert and dived to push it wide. Former Manchester United winger Wilfired Zaha slid in at the back post to turn home Bolasie's low cross to give Palace a first-half lead . The 22-year-old beat team-mate Jason Puncheon and QPR full back Yun Suk-Young to poke the ball home from close range . Zaha's momentum took him and Puncheon crashing into the post as both Palace players required treatment . Zaha and Puncheon both lay on the floor in pain after colliding with the post before both players were able to continue . James McArthur calls over to the bench for medical assistance as Palace's celebrations were cut short after taking the lead in the 21st minute . Palace manager Alan Pardew is targeting finishing above former club Newcastle, who he left in a shock move in December but has since reeled them to within reach. ‘I said to the players when I arrived to look above because if you look below there is anxiety and pressure,’ Pardew revealed. ‘You can't play like that. ‘You have to try to Newcastle, whoever is above us. We're above Everton, that was a bit of goal for us. Can we stay above them?’ But time is running out for QPR to stay in the league. ‘I’m hoping nine games is enough,’ Ramsey added. ‘That’s all that I’ve got, so we’ll go for it as best we can. ‘They’re still unified in what we’re trying to do, and all we can do really is to keep fighting.’ Even getting a stunning consolation goal flattered QPR at the final whistle and the fight is beginning to drain from them.","Crystal Palace beat Queens Park Rangers 3-1 in the Premier League at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon .

"An imposter posing as a former Pakistan cricket star and repeatedly conned the BBC into paying him to appear on air as a pundit. Nadeem Alam posed as ex-batsman Nadeem Abbasi on BBC World News, BBC Asian Network and Radio Five Live, despite only ever playing for his home town of Huddersfield.

Mr Abbasi, who has played three Tests for Pakistan in 1989, is furious that the pretender has damaged his country's reputation and plans to punch him if they ever meet, The Sun reported. He told the newspaper : 'If I ever find Nadeem Alam, I will punch him in the face for damaging the country's reputation.'

"England could be looking for a new bowling coach for the Ashes after David Saker confirmed he would be returning to his native Australia to coach Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League. Saker, 48, who has been with England for five years, has a six-month termination clause in his ECB contract, which could yet mean he sees out the summer in this country before heading home. But he is keen to move back to Australia sooner rather than later, and also hopes to become head coach of a state side in the first-class Sheffield Shield competition – with Victoria the favourites. England bowling coach David Saker has confirmed his return to Australia with Melbourne Renegades . Saker, pictured speaking to James Anderson, has worked with the England team for the last five years . If the ECB do allow Saker to head home before the Australians arrive to defend the Ashes this summer, that could pave the way for the return of Ottis Gibson, who quit as West Indies coach last year and was Saker's predecessor in the England fast-bowling role. Saker told the Melbourne Age: 'My first three years in the job for English cricket was a bit of a fairytale. But like most things it's hard to keep that form up. We lost some senior players, which made it a little bit harder. 'I'm sure everyone in the Australian camp don't think they can just walk up and win the Ashes. If they think that they've got something very wrong with them, because England in England are always hard to beat.' Saker's exit could open the door for Ottis Gibson, pictured with Anderson in 2007, to return to the role .

"England will leave a World Cup they can hardly be said to have graced having at least avoided another catastrophe in their final pretty meaningless match. When you have been as desperate as England in this tournament any win is a good one so they will  be relieved to have avoided what would have been the most embarrassing defeat of them all. A gloomy, miserable Sydney day matched the mood and turned this dead rubber into a damp one, with England winning a truncated contest with ease.

Afghanistan's Hamid Hassan (right) appeals unsuccessfully as England go on to claim victory . England bowler Chris Jordan (right) is presented with the Player of the Match award after posting figures of 2-13 . It will mean little to them but at least England avoided statistically their worst World Cup of all, their victories over Scotland and now Afghanistan matching their miserly returns of 1996 when they could defeat just Holland and the United Arab Emirates. This, though, feels much worse. The statistics, if we can dare mention them, will say that Afghanistan could only manage 111 for seven in the 36.2 overs that the weather allowed them before the third of three rain breaks brought their innings to a premature close. Then England, set 101 to win in 25 overs by Duckworth-Lewis, cruised home while losing just one wicket with 41 balls in hand, helped by a quite shocking fielding performance from Afghanistan. Alex Hales was dropped twice, both by Najibullah Zadran off the bowling of Shapoor Zadran, but showed the hitting he is capable of in reaching 37 before Afghanistan finally held on to a chance. And Ian Bell, playing in his 161st and surely his last one-day international for England with a new era about to dawn, signed off with an unbeaten 52.

Now England will slink off home on Saturday with much to contemplate if they are ever to have a chance of catching up with the big-hitters of this tournament who have simply left them behind in 50-over cricket. What cricket there was on Friday went England’s way, as it should against a team who have only been playing official cricket for the last 14 years. England had little to gain in their final group game and even more to lose against an Afghan team who have proved themselves here to be more than capable of causing some anxious moments for the established teams. But Afghanistan struggled against the moving ball and under leaden Sydney skies after Eoin Morgan had won an important toss in what might be the last game of his short reign as England’s one-day captain. Morgan is one of a number of senior England players who will have to wait and see whether they have a future in limited-overs cricket if the selectors take their only feasible option of starting from scratch with a new, young team. Two others who may be told to just concentrate on Test cricket in future are the established opening bowling pair of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad but both proved more than a handful for the inexperienced Afghan batsmen. Stuart Broad (second right) celebrates with his England team-mates after taking the wicket of Javed Ahmadi .

Afghanistan's Jamal (left) walks off the field as Bopara (centre) celebrates with England team-mate James Taylor (right) England's James Tredwell (left) attempts to run out Najibullah Zadran but the Afghanistan batsman was safe . Neither Anderson nor Broad have been at their best here, one of the many reasons why England have struggled, but at least they will be pleased with how they finished, both picking up a wicket and conceding just 18 runs each. England were without the injured pair of Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali and the men who stood in for them could also be satisfied with their work. The decision to leave out Ravi Bopara on the eve of the tournament to replace him with Gary Ballance is one of many to backfire on England and here he showed that he is more than capable of doing a decent job in the field. Bopara picked up two wickets and took an outstanding catch in the deep to give himself something to remember if he too is playing his last England game. James Tredwell has suffered because of the rise of Moeen as an off-spinner but he was as steady as ever here while the pick of the England bowlers was Chris Jordan, something for them to cling to as they ponder the future. The World Cup, which has confirmed that 50-over cricket is very much alive and kicking in the Twenty20 era, will now go on without England and the sad truth is that they will not be missed at all. They have to start all over again now. Shafiqullah (centre) and Jamal (left) take a drinks break during the Pool A match in Sydney .

"The 'disgraceful' reaction from Chelsea players forced referee Bjorn Kuipers to send off Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic during the ill-tempered Champions League tie at Stamford Bridge, said Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher. Carragher's fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness went further, branding Jose Mourinho's players 'pathetic', but co-commentator Gary Neville  defended the Blues for being 'shrewd'. Ibrahimovic was sent off after a lunging challenge on Chelsea's Oscar on the half hour mark but it appeared harsh as both players made forceful tackles. Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is shown a red card for fouling Oscar . The Chelsea players swarm around the referee with team-mate Oscar lying injured on the floor . Ibrahimovic is clearly dejected having been sent off after a collision with Oscar in the first-half . Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher labelled Chelsea players a 'disgrace' for their reaction to Ibrahimovic . The 33-year-old seemed apologetic as soon as he realised the impact of his challenge before the Chelsea players swarmed the referee demanding action. 'It was very unfortunate, it’s not a red card. I actually think he’s trying to pull his foot away. You look at it and you think Oscar’s foot is as high, if not higher,' Carragher said on Sky Sports. ‘If the referee is the other side then the referee might look at Oscar and give the decision the other way.' Carragher insisted the actions from the Chelsea players were the deciding factor in the dismissal. Jamie Carragher (left) and Graeme Souness (second right) slammed the behaviour of the Chelsea players . The 33-year-old heads into this challenge with Oscar (left) in the first-half which got him sent off . 'The reaction from the Chelsea players is disgraceful. It’s something that is sad that is coming into the game. It comes from I think Jose Mourinho’s teams, they have this reaction, it’s not a one off,' added Carragher. Souness branded the actions of Chelsea's squad 'pathetic'. He said: 'In Jamie’s (Carragher) generation, when someone caught you, the last thing you wanted to show your opponent is that you’re injured, today it’s the exact opposite. If someone brushes you, you want to go down and get them in trouble. That’s how pathetic it is. 'Thank goodness PSG stood up to that and leave here with great credit. They are the proper team.' Former Manchester United captain Neville disagreed with his colleagues. He said: ‘Listening to the lads at half-time, I’m not as damning about Chelsea reacting because partly times it happened during my career when you tried to influence the referee. But for far too many times you’ve seen naive English teams in Europe, that have been done on occasions like that. The PSG forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with Oscar . ‘Here, we’ve got a team that is shrewd. People at home might not like it but if the boot was on the other foot we’d be calling PSG shrewd. They play the game, that’s what you need to do in European competition over the last 20, 30 years. It’s different trying to gain those advantages. ‘I like the idea that it’s an English team that is shrewd and not the opposition. It comes from Mourinho, he knows how to play the game.’ However, Neville did acknowledge it was a harsh decision on Ibrahimovic:  'It's not a red card for me, I think that's a poor decision from the referee. He must have got his red card out within two or three seconds.' Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half at Stamford Bridge . At half-time, Carragher had also suggested that such intimidation comes from their manager Mourinho: 'I always think with Mourinho’s teams that they will always be respected but they’ll never be loved because of situations like this. 'They take winning to another level that no other team or manager does that I’ve seen over the years.' Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho gestures his dissatisfaction as his side crashed out of the Champions League . 'We all want to win but the reaction of the Chelsea players has definitely played a part and Jose Mourinho’s words in the press conference have worked.' Mourinho, in his post-match interview after his side were beaten on away goals, bemoaned PSG’s apparent time wasting but Carragher dismissed such claims as hypocrisy. ‘Mourinho is the master of time wasting and he did that from the first two minutes at Anfield last year (when Chelsea all but ended Liverpool’s title hopes),' he said. 'I’m not criticising him, I applauded him at the time and I know it’s part of the game, but he can’t complain about PSG and that English football is clean as the only dirty tricks we saw were from Chelsea by surrounding the referee and the reaction was disgraceful.’ The striker is consoled by PSG boss Laurent Blanc as he trudges off the pitch at Stamford Bridge . Carragher also questioned the quality of the Premier League after Chelsea crashed out: 'As a football person you want to see the best teams go through, we want the English teams to do well, to go through and represent our country,' he said at full-time. 'You think of the TV deal, the money we’ve got, we’re getting kidded. You see some of the players PSG have got. Now they’ve paid big money as well but you look at Arsenal, Man City. We’re supposed to be the biggest league in the world, with the best players. We are miles away.' Former Chelsea defender David Luiz jumps into the air in celebration having fired PSG back into the tie . Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness branded the Chelsea players 'pathetic' for their antics on Wednesday . In the Sky studio at full-time Souness was keen to highlight Chelsea's behaviour was 'unacceptable' and was full of praise for the Parisians: . 'It hurts me to say this but Chelsea earlier with their shenanigans early on, with the manager coming out with his talk that this is the most aggressive team we’ve ever played. Saying they are over physical, Mourinho is having a laugh,' Souness told Sky Sports. 'This is a team that is full of technique, a really good footballing team. They had to put up with a lot of stuff I find really unappealing. The Chelsea players are stunned as they were knocked out of the Champions League on Wednesday . 'That is from other players, the minute they come out of the tunnel, the first minute of the game, they are looking to get the opposition in trouble, get them booked, see if they can get them sent off. The reaction from the Chelsea players on the challenge on Oscar opitimises what I’m saying,' added Souness. 'To a man they were surrounding the referee, even Costa ran 50 yards to get involved. Oscar originally wasn’t going to get involved and then you can see in the pictures that as soon as his team-mates all raising their arms around the referee, then he gets involved. 'That’s something we can deal without, It’s not the British way of doing things and it is creeping into our game which I find it totally unacceptable.' Luiz and the PSG squad celebrate moving into the quarter-finals in front of their adouring fans .","PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic given straight red card for challenge on Chelsea's Oscar .

Last November Kai and his younger brother Klay were mascots when their father won his 100th England cap against Slovenia at Wembley.

"La Liga champions Atletico Madrid surrendered third place in La Liga to Valencia when they had Miranda sent off for a brutal challenge in first-half added time and were held to a 0-0 draw at mid-table Espanyol on Saturday. Atletico had the better chances at Espanyol's Cornella-El Prat stadium in Barcelona before centre back Miranda was shown a straight red card when he felled Abraham with a leading arm as the pair jumped for a bouncing ball. Forward Fernando Torres had forced a fine save from Espanyol goalkeeper Kiko Casilla in the 11th minute and midfielder Koke fired narrowly wide a minute later.

Playing with a man fewer in the second period Atletico struggled to create scoring opportunities but Raul Garcia came close to breaking the deadlock 13 minutes from time when his low shot was brilliantly tipped away by Casilla. Atletico, who are without a win in their last four games and need to overturn a 1-0 deficit when they host Bayer Leverkusen in a Champions League last 16, second leg tie on Tuesday, have 56 points in fourth with 11 games left. Valencia have 57 after Friday's 2-0 success at home to Deportivo La Coruna, while fifth-placed Sevilla (49) can close to within four points of Atletico by beating Elche on Sunday. Barcelona (62) can stretch their lead at the top over second-placed Real Madrid (61) to four points with a win at Eibar later on Saturday.

"Wigan coach Shaun Wane is hoping a series of cross-code training sessions with Bath can help kick-start his side's Super League campaign. The Warriors, who go into Friday's home game against Wakefield on the back of just two wins from their first six matches, have spent two days on a shared training camp at Orrell with Mike Ford's Premiership outfit. Wane, who reciprocated Bath's hospitality from last August, says his kickers picked up tips from their rugby union counterparts and that all his players will have benefited from lining up against the unknown in opposed training sessions. Wigan Warriors head coach Shaun Wane has been pleased with his side's training sessions with Bath . 'They looked after us last year at Bath and when we came back we went on a decent run in the play-offs so it paid off,' Wane said. 'We wanted to return the favour and we've had a great couple of days with them. 'We're running against players who don't know our systems so it's been really beneficial. We run against our 19s every day and they know what we're going to do so it's been a big help that way. 'We're trying to get benefits for both clubs.

"Mercedes . Engine: Mercedes . 44 Lewis Hamilton (GBR) Age: 30 . Grand Prix: 148 . Wins: 33 . 7 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Age: 29 . Grand Prix: 166 . Wins: 8 . Hamilton has got the confidence, but we do know that he can be fragile — his gaffe during qualifying for the British Grand Prix last year is a good example. Rosberg has a lot to prove, but he will undoubtedly learn from his mistakes. He will come back stronger. Nico Rosberg drives the new Mercedes car during testing at the Circuit de Catalunya in Spain on March 1 . Red Bull . Engine: Renault . 3 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Age: 25 . Grand Prix: 69 . Wins: 3 . 26 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Age: 20 . Grand Prix: 19 . Wins: 0 . New Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat takes the 2015 car round the track in Barcelona during a filming day . Williams . Engine: Mercedes . 19 Felipe Massa (Bra) Age: 33 . Grand Prix: 212 . Wins: 11 . 77 Valtteri Bottas . Age: 25 . Grand Prix: 38 . Wins: 0 . The flair and experience of Massa is balanced by the steely determination of Bottas, who I expect to lead the charge to Mercedes on a consistent basis. Massa is a great character and I hope he gets some good results, such as his pole position in Austria last year. Felipe Massa takes the WIlliams for a spin during testing in Barcelona at the end of February . Ferrari . Engine: Ferrari . 5 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Age: 27 . Grand Prix: 139 . Wins: 39 . 7 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Age: 35 . Grand Prix: 213 . Wins: 20 . There is less pressure on Vettel because it is a fresh challenge. It is the first time he has flown the nest and I expect to see him develop. Kimi was fantastic at races in 2013 but at the same events last year he was nowhere. The car will be better and I hope it gives him what he needs. Sebastian Vettel has moved from Red Bull to Ferrari for the 2015 season . McLaren . Engine: Honda . 14 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Age: 33 . Grand Prix's 236 . Wins: 32 . 22 Jenson Button (GBR) Age: 35 . Grand Prix's 268 . Wins: 15 . All team bosses nominated Alonso as the driver they would want, but he clearly has problems. Keeping Jenson was right, too, but the car is not where it needs to be. They finished fifth in 2014 with the best engine but have changed to Honda, so my gut says they will not improve. Great Britain's Jenson Button drives the new Honda powered McLaren at testing this month . Force India . Engine: Mercedes . 27 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Age: 27 . Grand Prix: 77 . Wins: 0 . 11 Sergio Perez (Mex) Age: 25 . Grand Prix: 77 . Wins: 0 . Hulkenberg is one of the stars but he has not been in the environment to win races, and I don’t know if he’ll achieve that at Force India. Last year Perez outshone him. Hulkenberg needs to be dominant if he wants to join a big team like Perez did at McLaren. Force India's Sergio Perez puts the car through its paces at the Circuit de Catalunya . Toro Rosso . Engine: Renault . 55 Carlos Sainz Jnr (Spa) Age: 20 . Grand Prix: 0 . Wins: 0 . 33 Max Verstappen (Hol) Age: 17 . Grand Prix: 0 . Wins: 0 . It is the youngest driver pairing in F1 history, but I like it. With greater experience, Jnr is who you would expect to lead the team, but I think we are going to get a big surprise from Max. He hardly made a mistake in testing, doesn’t miss apexes or lock brakes and looks in control. Toro Rosso's 17-year-old rookie Max Verstappen tests the new car earlier this month . Lotus . Engine: Mercedes . 8 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Age: 28 . Grand Prix: 64 . Wins: 0 . 13 Pastor Maldonado (Ven) Age: 29 . Grand Prix: 77 . Wins: 1 . I’m a big Grosjean fan, but the car was not very good last year and he struggled. If the team can deliver on performance — they have changed from Renault to Mercedes engines — we will see him up there. Pastor can deliver but he also crashes. He must reduce those incidents. Pastor Maldonado tests the new Lotus car at the circuit on the outskirts of Barcelona . Sauber . Engine: Ferrari . 9 Marcus Ericsson (Swe) Age: 24 . Grand Prix: 16 . Wins: 0 . 12 Felipe Nasr (Bra) Age: 22 . Grand Prix: 0 . Wins: 0 . A new driver line-up, with Adrian Sutil and Esteban Gutierrez leaving. Marcus Ericsson failed to set the world alight at Caterham in 2014, while Brazilian rookie Felipe Nasr battled for last year’s GP2 championship. Each brings £12m in sponsorship to the cash-strapped outfit. Felipe Nasr, who will be making his Formula One debut, tests the new Sauber . Manor . Engine: Ferrari . - Will Stevens (GBR) Age: 23 . Grand Prix: 1 . Wins: 0 . Will Stevens has got his chance but the big story here is that the team are on the grid and that really makes me smile. I am very pleased for all the guys there because they are racers with real passion. Why not give Paul di Resta a chance alongside the former Caterham driver?

"Ben Evans has had surgery after rupturing his hamstring against St Helens . Warrington's Wales international Ben Evans is set to spend around four months recuperating from a ruptured hamstring. The 22-year-old prop suffered the horrific injury during the Wolves' 32-24 defeat by Super League leaders St Helens last Thursday. He spent the weekend in London, where he underwent surgery, before returning to Warrington on Sunday night. 'It was a particularly nasty injury and he was in a considerable amount of discomfort at the time,' Warrington assistant coach Richard Agar said. 'But they got him off to hospital as soon as they possibly could and got him down to London the next day to see the specialist. 'He's had a fairly extensive operation to re-attach it but it's going to be a long injury. The first estimates are around four months but all that will depend on the success of the operation and how he rehabs. 'If it goes well for him, he will have a chance of playing again this year and at this place he is going to get the best medical care.' The Wales international (centre) will be sidelined, alongside brother Rhys, for around four months . Evans will have the company of his twin brother Rhys, the Warrington winger, during his recovery period. Rhys underwent shoulder surgery after damaging it during the Wolves' World Club Series clash with St George Illawarra in February and is facing a similar length of time on the sidelines. 'It's sad for Ben because he's got an opportunity that he had been patiently waiting for,' added Agar. 'Both him and Rhys have now picked up sizeable injuries and will be out for a similar length of time.'","Ben Evans was injured during Super League defeat by St Helens .

"To begin with, Mark Cavendish seems like he might rank among the more challenging interviewees. He anticipates questions before they’ve been asked, refuses to give an answer to some and offers monosyllabic responses to others. He curses when he talks about the doping scandals in his sport and complains that the newspapers only cover such stories in cycling. Has he not read the recent coverage of similar scandals in athletics and rugby? With a wry smile, he accepts that he hasn’t. British cyclist Mark Cavendish, pictured with Lee Matthews, insists he has plenty more to give . Help for Heroes patron Cavendish is confident he's not past his best following his 11 wins in 2014 . Cavendish believes he doesn't get the media coverage he deserves because he no longer rides for Team Sky . It might be that we’ve got off on the wrong foot. We meet in the bar of a hotel in Windsor and I congratulate him on his victory in Belgium the previous day. I remark that he’s had a ‘couple’ of good wins already this season. ‘I’ve had six,’ he responds a little tersely. But this is what makes him interesting beyond his brilliance at the business end of professional bike racing, beyond the explosive drama of a peloton hurtling towards the finish line at 40-odd mph. He has long proved himself a master racer with his sharp bike skills and that explosive turn of pace. But Cavendish has a sharp mind, too. It makes interviewing him something of a contest but an experience that is utterly fascinating. When he talks about the support he provides our injured servicemen and women as a patron for Help for Heroes, there is genuine emotion. He takes a swipe at ‘the government’ for not doing enough for these ‘amazing people’. He can relate to the ‘team mentality’ that develops among soldiers. ‘It’s more than a job,’ he says. ‘It’s a family. As a sportsman I get that.’ There are moments when he displays the intensity of a Roy Keane, occasionally communicating his objection to a question by simply staring back at you. But here’s a sportsman who is also not afraid to express an opinion and by the end of our chat he has shared quite a few. Cavendish left Team Sky because he thought the focus was on Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome . Cavendish felt Froome (left) and Wiggins (right) received preferential treatment during his time at Team Sky . ‘People think I’m past it,’ he says, unprompted. At 29, is he? ‘No,’ he says. There is a pause. He has clearly decided he has nothing further to say on the subject even if it is one that irks him. But I ask if it’s something he can prove to himself with facts and figures. Cycling is pretty scientific these days, after all. ‘I measure it by wins,’ he says. ‘I had 11 wins last year, which is more than any other British rider. But because I ride for a team that’s not supported by a media giant I don’t really get the coverage other riders enjoy.’ He is having a dig at Team Sky here, the ‘British’ team he represented for a year but left when he realised the focus was more on Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome and winning the grand tours than on delivering him to the front of the peloton to win stages. As the finest pure bike racer in the world at that time — he was the Manx Missile L’Equipe had voted the greatest sprinter in the history of the Tour de France — his frustration was understandable. But the truth is last year was not as successful as previous seasons. At least not in the eyes of cycling fans who measure Cavendish by his grand tour stage victories. He crashed out of the Tour de France in that opening-day sprint into Harrogate and appeared to have been superseded by the giant German, Marcel Kittel, as the main man in a tarmac tear-up. The 29-year-old believes he will reach his peak during his 30s and is confident he is now at the right team . A significantly larger man than Cavendish — 6ft 2in plays 5ft 9in — Kittel is a powerhouse. But Cavendish makes the point that his best is yet to come because ‘sprinters often peak in their 30s’ and also says ‘it’s not simply about pure power’. ‘It’s not as scientific as you think,’ he says. ‘I know what weight I have to be.’ Which is what? ‘I know what weight I have to be.’ So he’s pretty confident he’s not past his best? ‘Yeah, I’m pretty confident I’m not past my best,’ he says, repeating the question virtually word for word. I mention his startling victories on the Champs Elysees in 2009 and 2010 — the first two of four successive wins in the final stage of the Tour — and ask him if he remains the same bike racer. ‘I don’t compare myself to then,’ he says. ‘But I’ve won six races by the end of February.’ It’s as simple as that? ‘It’s as simple as the fact that when I first came in, people looked at when I won,’ he says. ‘I’ve won so much now they only report when I lose.’ His take on Kittel is fascinating. He doesn’t refer to him by name and regards it more as a rivalry between teams than individuals. Cavendish, pictured during a race in Lido di Camaiore, has had a successful start to 2015 . ‘My team has had a rival,’ he says. ‘It has taken us three years (at Etixx-Quick Step) to piece a new team together. But now I’m pretty confident I’ve got the strongest lead-out team. He’s had a team that has been built around him for years. I lost a team that had been built around me, when HTC folded. We didn’t build anything at Sky. And it’s taken two, three years at Quick Step but now I believe we’re there. ‘Last year he (Kittel) only won one more race than me and I was out for half the season. Head to head, he’s probably got the better of me most times. But don’t forget the amount of times I’ve been in the final run-in and he’s already been dropped on a climb. ‘He’s supposed to be the best sprinter in the world, the most powerful rider in a sprint, but that doesn’t mean I’ve lost anything. I win bike races.’ Even after all the he success he has enjoyed, the 43 grand tour stage wins, the world titles, Cavendish insists he remains as hungry as ever. And you can tell he is. You can tell he is miffed that people think there’s now somebody better out there, that he’s not the dominant force he once was. That he’s even now under pressure to secure a new contract when his current deal expires at the end of the season. ‘I still enjoy being the best,’ he says. ‘And I don’t just want to be the best I can be. I want to be the best of everyone. And I have another reason to want to be the best: it’s not just about me any more, it’s about my family and I want to be able to give them a good life. ‘But it’s not just a job. It’s still something I love. Cavendish is confident dopers will be kicked out of cycling because 'the system is working' Andre Agassi claimed in his autobiography Open that he did not like tennis despite his success . ‘You know in Andre Agassi’s book, where he says he didn’t like tennis? I’m telling you, he liked tennis. It was the stuff around it he probably got sick of. I understand that. But the core part of it, the thing that I love, is bike racing. I’m not fortunate to be where I am because I made it happen. But I feel lucky to be able to ride my bike for a living.’ He gives his view on the recent drug scandals — it should be pointed out that this interview was conducted before the publication of the CIRC report into the sport’s doping problem — with the same conviction. ‘There are always going to be d***heads,’ he says in reference to the five positives that could result in the Astana team losing its racing licence. ‘There are some guys, if I had a team, I wouldn’t touch. But there’s a lot of innocent people who are going to suffer now. ‘It’s f***ing stupid that there is five in one team. Like, come on, really? You have to have a problem. If you’re doping in cycling I can’t believe how s**t you must be as a cyclist. These guys aren’t even winning. When I started there were dopers. I don’t think it was rife but you could see it. But year on year it’s got better. ‘You still see it. It’s hard to explain. But when you are riding you know how it is to suffer. You know how you breathe, how you look. You can see when something isn’t right. But at least they are being caught. It shows the system is working.’ His final words, though, are for those whose work has been on the battlefield, who have been injured and are now striving to rebuild their lives with the amazing support of Help for Heroes. ‘It is an incredible charity and I find it humbling to be around them,’ he says. ‘These are the people who keep us safe.’ Mark Cavendish is encouraging Daily Mail readers to Ride with Heroes by signing up to the Help for Heroes Hero Ride 2015: the biggest ever cycling show of gratitude and support for our injured servicemen and women.

"Harry Kane is closing in on the record for scoring in the most consecutive away matches in Premier League history after his match-winning brace at Queens Park Rangers. In all competitions, the Tottenham striker has scored more goals (26) this season than any player in England's top four tiers, and his away form has been particularly impressive. Kane has scored eight goals in his last six away Premier League games. Only Robin van Persie has surpassed that achievement in the competition's 23 seasons. Tottenham striker Harry Kane celebrates at Loftus Road after scoring in his side's 2-1 win against QPR . Kane netted a brace in front of the watching Roy Hodgson to help his side claim a crucial win in west London . Robin van Persie - Nine (Arsenal 2010-11) Harry Kane - Six (Tottenham 2014-15) Daniel Sturridge - Six (Liverpool 2013-14) Didier Drogba - Six (Chelsea 2009-10) Kane scored at Swansea, Leicester City, Crystal Palace, West Brom (two), Liverpool, and QPR (two) to put him second on the list overall. The 21-year-old is tied in second place with Didier Drogba, who achieved the feat at Chelsea in 2009-10, and Daniel Sturrridge, who did the same at Liverpool last season. Van Persie's remarkable run came in his penultimate season at Arsenal where he scored in every single league away game from January 1 to May 22. This is just the latest statistic a spectacular season for Tottenham academy graduate Kane. He is currently the top English scorer in the Premier League and the third highest scoring player from Europe's top five leagues (behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo) and could become the first Tottenham player in the Premier League era to break the 30-goal barrier. Jurgen Klinsmann managed 29 in all competitions during the 199-95 season for Spurs, Kane needs just four more from the remaining 10 games to beat that. Robin van Persie scored in every single Premier League away game between January 1 to May 22 . Didier Drogba scored in six consecutive away matches for Chelsea during the 2009-10 season .

"Joe Hart believes that Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany will benefit from being axed by manager Manuel Pellegrini. Kompany was dropped to the bench for Wednesday’s home win over Leicester City after some below-par performances. Hart knows how the Belgium defender is feeling after he was left out for seven league games last season following a loss of form. But the England keeper is confident Kompany will come back stronger for the experience. Vincent Kompany was dropped for Manchester City's 2-0 win against Leicester City on Wednesday . Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart said Kompany would fight his way back into the team . Hart said: ‘Vinny appreciates, same as we all do, that sometimes the manager will change the squad. There is no-one destined to play every single game — I’ve learned that lesson. Vinny is an unbelievable player, one of the best I have ever played with, and that was his night off. I’m sure he will be back in the team again with that captain’s armband, being one of the best defenders in world football.’ The 2-0 victory over Leicester preserved City’s title hopes as they try to catch Chelsea, but it was only the ninth time this season that Pellegrini’s side have kept a clean sheet. ‘It has not been good enough,’ said Hart. ‘We’d all accept that, myself included. It’s not just the back four and the goalkeeper, we defend as a team. I don’t set out to be brutally honest but I’d struggle to say things any other way.’ City have won both their Premier League titles on the last day, but Hart added: ‘I’m not that bothered about topping previous seasons in terms of drama. Winning the league is the most important thing, whether we do it dramatically or not.’ Central defender Kompany has been criticised for some of his performances this season .

"Two Utah police officers have been suspended without pay over a risque video shoot featuring bikini-clad women firing high-powered weapons. The Utah Department of Public Safety imposed the discipline in December on Rob Wilkinson, a Utah Highway Patrol sergeant, and Justin Hansen, a State Bureau of Investigation agent. The department released its discipline records last week after receiving a request to obtain them by The Salt Lake Tribune. Wilkinson, who received a three-day suspension, and Hansen, who received a one-day suspension, were at the Big Shot Ranch near Grantsville in June when British bikini models posed for photos and were videotaped firing guns for a calendar called 'Hot Shots.' The two men were seen wearing camouflage uniforms identifying them as police in a promotional video filmed at Camp Williams in May and posted on YouTube in October. Scroll down for video . Risque: The models were at Camp Williams for a Hot Shots pinup calendar and behind-the-scenes video shoot. Two Utah peace officers were disciplined as a result . Exposed: Men were spotted in the promotional video wearing camouflage gear with 'police' on the back . Neither Wilkinson nor Hansen sought their superiors' permission to participate, and superiors learned of the activity only when they saw video clips played by the news media in Utah, according to the records. The men were disciplined for conduct that brings discredit to an officer or agency, and for wearing their uniform during a promotion for a product — both rules violations, the records show. Wilkinson and Hansen declined comment. An acquaintance asked the two to help supervise the firing line where the models shot at targets, according to an internal affairs report. The report also notes Hot Shots purports to donate a portion of its proceeds to charities for wounded soldiers. In November, four Utah National Guard soldiers were disciplined for their unauthorized involvement and use of military vehicles in a video featuring the bikini-clad women firing high-powered weapons and riding in tanks. A non-commissioned officer who inappropriately allowed the video to be partially shot at Camp Williams in May was relieved of his duties, and three other soldiers received lesser measures ranging from counseling to a reprimand. The men's superiors did not learn about their involvement with the video until they saw the coverage in Utah news reports, the investigation revealed .

"A New Mexico middle school teacher has quit her job and is lashing out at her school district after she claims she was threatened and bullied by her students. Sharon Moran, 47, retired from McKinley Middle School in Albuquerque last week after getting a death threat from on of her students. The Michigan State University graduate has worked as a teacher for 12 years, but felt she couldn't continue due to the hostile environment at the school. Sharon Moran, 47, says she retired because a middle school student threatened her life while she was teaching . Moran, who has taught for 12 years, was at McKinley Middle School in Albuquerque, New Mexico (pictured) The death threat was the final straw in Moran's decision to quit, KOAT reported. Administrators from Albuquerque Public Schools did not respond 'correctly to the threat that was made', according to Moran. She said: 'I do feel like I'm being intimidated and I feel like I'm bullied. 'I had to kind of evaluate every day what kind of situation I'm going into every day and whether or not I'm safe. 'My family is concerned for my safety. 'They worry about me and I think I did the right thing.' In an earlier incident at McKinley, a male teacher, 71, was hurt while breaking up a fight between two students . During an incident at McKinley earlier this year, a 71-year-old male teacher was hurt while breaking up a fight between two students. Vincent Criscuola, a special education teacher, was punched and thrown into a wall during the incident. Criscuola had to take time off after suffering a spinal strain, a neck sprain and a hip injury. However, he did decide to return to the school despite admitting, 'I don't feel safe there'. He said: 'It just upsets me. 'We're there to teach and take care of these kids and watch out for their safety.' The principal and vice principal at McKinley have not responded to a request for comment.","Sharon Moran says she retired because a student threatened her life .

"This is the shocking moment an angry mob refused to let an animal welfare charity rescue a injured performing elephant who had been abused. Indian elephant Mohan is kept shackled with heavy chains around his legs and is often left malnourished and injured, with his owners forcing him to beg on the streets. It prompted charity Wildlife SOS to launch a rescue operation to save Mohan and give him much needed treatment. Scroll down for video . A mob of 300 people surround Mohan as animal welfare charity Wildlife SOS attempt to rescue the abused elephant . The charity were forced to call in the police to help out with the operation, which was eventually aborted on safety grounds . But when the 55-strong team descended on the town of Lalganj in northern India to give treatment to the animal, a mob of 300 people surrounded them to stall the operation. Wildlife SOS were then forced to call the police as the mob became violent with over 40 officers drafted in to try to calm the situation. But with fears for the safety of the rescue team, a local magistrate ordered the operation to be aborted and the charity had to leave the elephant behind. Now the elephant's owner, Bhupendar Mishra has been accused of sending the crowd to stop the seizure of the animal. Mohan is kept shackled by his owners and is often forced to beg and perform for food and money . The elephant is also kept with heavy chains around his legs, and according to the charity is often malnourished and injured . Deputy Conservator of Forests, Y.P Shukla said: 'Mr Bhupendar Mishra has illegal custody of the elephant and is trying to manipulate and mislead the crowd. He is being supported by his two brothers. 'He is trying to stall the rescue of the elephant by filing revisions and misleading the courts although he has already lost the court battle.' Mohan, who is aged 56, was stole from his wild herd more than 50 years ago and has been used as a begging and performing elephant ever since. Mohan is paraded through the streets at night with leaves and branches tied to his back and is forced to beg . Mohan was stolen from his wild herd more than 50 years ago and has been exploit in several different Indian towns . After he was bought, he was chained for several years to be trained before being exploited in several Indian towns, where he has been subjected to abuse and forced to work long hours. Co-ordinator of Wildlife SOS Baiji Raj said: 'We will leave no stone unturned to rescue Mohan and are hopeful that we can successfully rescue him. The charity has now set up an appeal on their website to help fund the elephant's rescue.","Indian elephant Mohan is kept in chains and is forced to beg and perform .

"Detroit Red Wings star Darren Helm was looking to get a little sleep on Sunday night after an impressive overtime win by his team. That was not to be however, as shortly after midnight his girlfriend, Devon Englot, informed him that she was in labor. And this was a quick delivery, so quick in fact that the two did not make it to the hospital in time and Helm had to step up and deliver his daughter Rylee in the back of his car. Detroit Red Wings star and his longtime girlfriend Devon Englot welcomed a baby girl, Rylee (above) on Monday . After Helm won in overtime Sunday night (left), he went home and got to bed but was woken up shortly after midnight by Englot (right with Helm and their daughter Reece) who was in labor . The Red Wings report that Helm started gathering their things when he got the news that the baby was coming, phoning the hospital from his home as he loaded the car. Englot however, who is also the mother of another child, the couple's 3-year-old daughter Reece, started to feel things moving a little too fast. 'Devon kept on saying that she had the urge to push,' Helm said. And Helm realized what that meant. 'They said when the baby’s ready, the baby’s ready. She can’t really control much about it. We tried to make it there. She tried to hold her back,' he said. 'They’ve always told us the second one comes quicker, but we didn’t expect it to be that quick.' Mom, dad and big sister are all doing fine now . The couple were a mile away from the Providence Park Hospital in Novi, Michigan, when Helm got in the backseat and delivered their baby. 'It came on so quick. We thought we had lots of time to get to the hospital and things just took a turn and the baby was ready to come out to say hello and that’s what she did,' he explained. Five minutes later, they were back on their way to the hospital with their new passenger. 'We got to the ER and they kept assuring us that things were going to be OK after they got a good look at the baby and Devon was feeling good,' said Helm. 'After that things slowly calmed down. It took us awhile to kind of get over what happened, but things are moving along pretty well.'","Detroit Red Wings star and his longtime girlfriend Devon Englot welcomed a baby girl, Rylee on Monday .

"BT is to launch its own mobile phone service along with free access to Premier League football on the go starting at £5 a month. The move has been welcomed by consumer groups as the telecoms giant attempts to spread its empire from home telephone, internet and pay TV into mobile phones. This so-called ‘quad play’ service is seen as key by the likes of BT and its rivals Sky, Virgin and TalkTalk to future growth and profits. BT is to launch its own mobile phone service along with free access to Premier League football . BT hopes that it will be able to sign up millions of households to packages that include the four services to cement its place as Britain’s dominant media company in the 21st century. The company’s move comes ahead of its purchase of the UK’s largest mobile phone network EE in a deal worth £12.5billion. It has unveiled three SIM card deals, where customers buy a SIM and simply fit it to their existing handset in order to get access to calls, texts and 4G internet services, including video streaming. The service will operate across the EE masts as well as the wi-fi network offered via more than five million BT Wi-fi hotspots. The 12-month contracts will appeal to people who want to keep their existing handset but add a relatively cheap bundle of 4G data, minutes and texts. Alternatively, they can buy a new 4G phone from the BT Shop from as little as £99. The cheapest SIM card deal offers 500 MB of 4G data, unlimited texts and 200 minutes of calls for £5 a month if you are an existing BT Broadband customer and £10 a month for everyone else. The monthly charge for 2GB of data on 4G, unlimited texts and 500 minutes of calls is £12 for BT customers and £17 for others. At the top end, customers can take an enormous 4G data allowance of 20GB, with unlimited texts and minutes, for either £20 a month for BT customers or £25 for other customers. The cheapest deal will be for existing customers, at just £5 per month for 500 MB of 4G data, unlimited texts and 200 minutes of calls . BT is sweetening the offer by giving away free BT Sport on the BT Sport App, which offers live Barclays Premier League football matches. There is also a spending cap on all tariffs. Executive director at Which?, Richard Lloyd, suggested the BT move will boost competition and so could be good news for consumers. ‘BT entering the quad play market could lead to stronger competition but consumers need to be able to easily compare prices of the services offered. Any impact on competition in the mobile market will depend on the terms of BT’s agreement with EE,’ he said. ‘BT should use its entry into this market to drive improvements in customer service and to innovate for its customers. Any positive changes must not be set back by the merger of BT and EE.’ Mobile expert at the website broadbandchoices, Dominic Baliszewski, said: ‘BT’s 4G SIM-only launch is exactly the kind of shake up that was needed. ‘Starting at just £5 per month, the pricing is very competitive for existing BT customers and confirms BT’s ambitious plans to dominate quad-play before anyone else can get a foothold. ‘TalkTalk and Virgin Media have both had their own mobile offering for a while now, yet people have so far remained hesitant to sign up on a quad-play basis. ‘Broadband, TV and phone is still very much seen as a household purchase whereas a mobile phone service is considered a personal one. Bringing about a shift in perception will not happen overnight but if BT are willing to put the marketing muscle so badly needed behind these packages, quad-play could completely change the bundles market.’ John Petter, chief executive of BT Consumer, said: ‘Offering BT customers the UK’s best value 4G data deal is a great way to start our journey towards re-establishing ourselves as a major player in consumer mobile. ‘We are offering 4G on the UK’s biggest network along with unlimited access to the most extensive wi-fi coverage via our 5m BT Wi-fi hotspot network. ‘Our customers are consuming increasing amounts of data and they want the best possible connection wherever they are. It’s our ambition to meet this demand by combining the power of our fixed fibre service with wi-fi and the convenience of mobile.’ TalkTalk hit back by claiming it already offers cheap mobile tariffs starting from £3.75 a month. Spokesman, Tristia Harrison, said: ‘Our mission is to make Britain better off, that’s why TalkTalk homes make significant savings compared to other providers, while also getting more for their money. We offer better value tariffs with a great range of handsets. The rapid growth of our mobile base is proof that more and more homes are reaping the benefits of Britain's best value quad-play services.’","So-called ‘quad play’ service is seen as key by the mobile companies .

'We take great pride in delivering the mail to the American public, that’s what we do. We do it every day.,' said a USPS spokesperson. Two USPS representatives also visited the Gonzales home to apologize. What's more, Amazon has offered Gonzales a 20 percent discount for his negative experience.

"The wife of a young lawyer found stabbed to death in a hotel just five blocks from the White House has made an emotional appeal for anyone with information about her husband’s death to come forward. The body of 30-year-old David Messerschmitt was discovered at The Donovan on February 10 - 24 hours after his wife, Kim Vuong, reported him missing. On Wednesday, six weeks after her husband’s brutal murder, Vuong spoke to the media outside the Metropolitan Police Department’s headquarters in Washington D.C. Scroll down for video . Kim Vuong made an emotional plea for anyone with information about husband David Messerschmitt's death at The Donovan hotel in Washington D.C. on February 10 to come forward on Wednesday . David Messerschmitt, pictured with his wife Kim Vuong, was found stabbed to death inside a boutique hotel in Washington, D.C. six weeks ago. Police are still unclear of the motive . Vuong asked the public for help in solving the mystery surrounding her husband's death. 'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. Messerschmitt, a 30-year-old D.C. attorney, was found partially clothed and stabbed in the back at the upscale boutique hotel. Vuong told police she last saw her husband on February 8 and received a text from Messerschmitt around 7:30 p.m. the following day that said he would behome soon. Messerschmitt never made it home and Vuong reported him missing on February 9. Messerschmitt's body was discovered the morning of February 10, reports ABC7. Also at Wednesday’s press conference police confirmed that a person of interest captured in previously released surveillance video was a woman. She can be seen wearing a dark, hooded jacket while walking through the lobby and a stairwell. Police have asked for help identifying the person and have offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Authorities have released images from surveillance footage showing a 'person of interest' at the hotel, who they have now confirmed is a woman . Before taking the stairs, the unidentified person waited impatiently for an elevator at the hotel around 7.45pm . Detective Paris White told Daily Mail Online last month that theft was not considered a motive in the crime because all of the victim's valuables, including his wallet, had been left at the scene. The couple, who married in 2012, lived together in an apartment just three miles from the hotel. Vuong was not aware her husband was at The Donovan when he sent the text message and she couldn't provide other details of his plans for that day, Detective White said. The DC Metropolitan detective said that the investigation was 'looking at everything' surrounding Messerschmitt's murder, including his work as a lawyer. His laptop was seized and investigators had trawled his social media accounts for clues. The lawyer was found dead at The Donovan, pictured, five blocks from the White House and around three miles from the apartment he shared with his wife. It was not yet clear why he was even at the hotel . Messerschmitt, whose family lives in Cincinnati, graduated from Ohio State University in 2006 and from the Boston University Law School in 2009. After leaving college, he interned with Susan Dlott, a judge for the U.S. District Court Southern District of Ohio in Cincinnati. In April 2014, he joined DLA Piper in Washington, D.C., where he worked as an associate. His biography for the firm described him as an intellectual-property attorney who negotiated commercial and technology agreements.

"Gareth Bale rammed some of the ridiculous criticism he has received in recent weeks from Real Madrid supporters back down their throats with a first-half double and the perfect goal celebration. The former Tottenham forward, who scored 22 goals in 44 games in his first season at the club - including strikes that won the Copa del Rey and Champions League final - has had to put up with whistles in his own stadium and a fan poll that had 40 per cent of supporters calling for him to be dropped in recent weeks. When he put Real Madrid ahead on 18 minutes in the 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday night he made sure he left off some steam, covering his ears as he ran to the corner to give the flag a celebratory kick. Gareth Bale celebrates, with obvious relief, after breaking a long scoring drought to put Real Madrid ahead at the Bernabeu . The Welsh winger covers both his ears to demonstrate that he has not been listening to the boos from the Real Madrid fans . Bale ran to the corner flag and kicked it as he let out some pent-up frustration having found the net for the first time since January . Real Madrid's two expensive superstars both celebrate after Bale had diverted Ronaldo's shot into the corner of the net to make it 2-0 . Real Madrid (4-3-3): Navas; Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo; Modric (Illarramendi 78mins), Silva, Isco (Jese 69); Bale, Benzema (Hernandez 82), Ronaldo. Subs not used: Casillas, Nacho, Varane, Kroos. Goals: Bale 18, 40 . Booked: Modric . Levante (4-2-3-1): Marino; Lopez, Navarro, Ramis, Tono; Camarasa, Simao; Xumetra (Garcia 59), Barral, Morales (El Zhar 59); Uche (Casadesus 75). Subs not used: Fernandez, Juanfran, Mari, Sissoko. It was his first goal in nine games but with 16 in 38 this season he remains on course to match last year's haul and the singling out from those jeering supporters and some Madrid-based media had clearly got to him. The only player who did not seem to share his joy was Cristiano Ronaldo. It was his failed bicycle kick that was cleared off the line and came back out for Bale to volley into the top corner. Ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air at his missed effort both before and after Bale had buried the rebound. It was hardly the action of a man playing solely for his team. The Welshman scored again five minutes before the break, diverting a Ronaldo shot past Diego Marino. Ronaldo's effort looked as if it was going wide and although Bale's touch was slight it was necessary and he was awarded the goal. Bale's first half performance will have silenced those calls for him to be left out of the Real Madrid team. The jeers that have followed him around the pitch in recent weeks could even be heard when his name was read out before this win - although those for rested goalkeeper Iker Casillas and coach Carlo Ancelotti were more noticeable. Bale almost scored inside two minutes, taking a long ball forward down on his chest and volleying it across the face of goal. He looked motivated and buoyed by the return of Luka Modric in midfield - making his first start for over three months. Bale has come in for plenty of criticism from the La Liga crowd in recent weeks, but looked to have found his form at the right time . Karim Benzema tracks Levante's David Navarro as Real Madrid sought to respond after a poor performance against Schalke . Ronaldo cannot mask his frustration after striking the post with an early chance to put Real ahead against Levante . The World Player of the Year endured a difficult first half, with his temper bubbling below the surface despite Real Madrid taking control . It was a Modric shot that Marino pushed out to the edge of the six-yard box that Karim Benzema turned in moments later but all three Real Madrid forwards - Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo - were offside. Modric then took a corner won by Bale and planted it on the Welshman's head only for the effort to go just wide. Bale was everywhere in the first 45 minutes, even popping up on the left and drilling the perfect cross to the edge of the six-yard box where Ronaldo somehow managed to fail to get enough on the centre and sent it wide. Real Madrid had former Levante keeper Keylor Navas playing against his old team. Casillas will return for next week's visit to the Camp Nou. The stand-in keeper was a spectator for the most part as Real Madrid dominated and Benzema could have made it three in spectacular fashion after the break. He flicked the ball onto the crossbar with a volley from a Ronaldo cross from the right and then caught the rebound again on the volley only to send it tamely wide. Ronaldo also shot straight at Marino five minutes from time and skied an effort from the edge of the six-yard box in injury time. It wasn't his night but it had been Madrid's. They moved to within a point of Barcelona with the victory. It brings to an end a run of two defeats and a draw and sets them, and Bale, up perfectly for next week's potentially season-deciding Clasico. VIDEO Bale was more motivated - Ancelotti .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez believes his side have finally banished the fear factor which has been holding them back. The 3-0 win over 10-man Newcastle thanks to goals from James McCarthy, Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley was the Toffees' first at Goodison Park in the league in 2015. It was a crucial one as it lifted them six points clear of the relegation zone and Martinez believes the basis for the performance was founded in the come-from-behind 2-1 Europa League win over Dynamo Kiev on Thursday. Roberto Martinez believes Everton have finally banished the fear factor which has been holding them back . James McCarthy (right) opened the the scoring against Newcastle and was congratulated by Aaron Lennon . 'It was a big game for us and sometimes that can bring extra pressure in that you play the occasion rather than the game,' he said. 'The perfect preparation was Thursday. Probably Thursday was a real turning point in that moment when we managed to take control of the situation. The first 20 minutes (against Kiev) was as bad as it can be in terms of suffering because you feel the anxiety and responsibility as a player then all of a sudden we found the way we should perform. 'The mindset today wasn't of a team who had fear of losing at home, some of the play was outstanding but when we had to defend and work hard for each other we did that with total composure. 'From scoring the first goal we managed the game really well and I thought we defended really composed. Tim Howard had a big save in the second half but apart from that I thought we protected him very well. Everton were already 2-0 up when Magpies captain Fabricio Coloccini was sent off for a lunge at winger Aaron Lennon and Martinez had no doubts about the straight red card. Romelu Lukaku, having set up McCarthy for the opener, netted Everton's second from the penalty spot . 'I haven't seen the replay but I thought it was reckless and high,' he added. 'If you look at the reaction of the Newcastle players I don't think anyone was surprised when they saw the red card. 'I don't think it was a turning point or the reason why we won because we were very much in control but it always helps.' Newcastle caretaker boss John Carver's initial thoughts were to agree with Martinez but he admits he will closely examine all footage over the next day or two before deciding the next course of action. 'I have looked at it from four or five angles and it is not conclusive,' he said. Ross Barkley celebrates after giving gloss to the victory with a stoppage time strike to make it 3-0 . 'When it actually happened, from the reaction of the Everton players, straight away I thought 'that must be a red'. But when I came in and looked at it, it was very difficult to decide. 'I will look at it again and if it is worthy of a sending off then I will accept it but if it is not I will appeal. 'There seemed to be more of their players surrounding the situation than our players.' With nothing to play for Newcastle are limping towards the end of the season but Carver stressed that would not be allowed to happen and there was an immediate dressing room inquest after the game, although he was keen to point out it was not confrontational. 'A few of the guys had a few composed words after the match,' he added. 'I told one or two players not to say anything because usually it is one or two players who come forward - I wanted it to come from other people. 'The fact people make a point I think is a healthy situation - it can't always come from me, I'm not a dictator. 'We can't go hiding or disappear anywhere. I can't walk around miserable as sin, I have to do something about it. 'The guys had a good two-way conversation and we will review it all on Tuesday.'","Everton beat hapless Newcastle 3-0 at Goodison Park on Sunday .

"A mother and daughter who starved their pet dog so badly he was left as only 'skin and bone' have been banned for keeping animals for five years. Rosemary Robinson, 41, and daughter Rachel, 19, starved their pointer cross, named George, to the point where he was able to tuck his knees under his ribcage. Hastings Magistrates Court heard that the pet was also covered in sores, and was suffering from a lung condition due to a lack of worming. Rosemary Robinson, 41, and daughter Rachel, 19, have been banned from keeping any animals for five years after starving pet pointer cross George . The dog was so emaciated he was able to tuck his back legs up under his ribcage, and was also covered in sores and masses, according to the RSPCA . George was in such a bad state and living in such pain that vets were forced to put him down. Neither of the owners, from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, turned up to the hearing, and so were sentenced in their absence to a multitude of animal welfare offences. Rosemary was also given a community order for six months, a six month curfew and made to pay £1,063 costs and fines. Rachel was handed a 12-month community order, 100 hours unpaid work and ordered to pay £763 in costs and fines. The RSPCA was called with concern in February after George was finally taken to a vet. George was also suffering from a lung condition due to a lack of worming, and was in such constant pain that vets had to put him down . Ms Robinson and her daughter failed to appear at their court hearing and so were sentenced in their absence to a multitude of animal abuse charges . One RSPCA worker said that George's condition was only discovered after the owners eventually took him to the vet, and concerned staff called them . RSPCA inspector Zoe Ballard said: 'George was one of the thinnest dogs I have ever seen and had clearly been deteriorating and suffering for some time. 'As well as being emaciated he had lumps and masses all over his body and was suffering from a chronic lung condition caused by lack of worming. 'He had deteriorated to such an extent that he was living in constant pain - It was obvious at first glance that he should have been taken to a vet a long time before.'","Rosemary Robinson, 41, and daughter Rachel, 19, neglected pet George .

"Gary Neville surveyed Tottenham's right-side and described it as a 'graveyard' after it was torn apart in the first-half by Manchester United. The problem for England coach Neville and his boss Roy Hodgson, who was at Old Trafford, was that this graveyard shift was manned by four Englishmen: Kyle Walker, Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Eric Dier. Like Harry Kane and Danny Rose, also in the Spurs team, they had been hoping to deliver the type of display which might catch Hodgson's eye for the right reasons after he had changed his plans and hit the north, rather than go to Chelsea. Andros Townsend fails to hide his frustration after being taken off at Old Trafford during a torrid first half . England manager Roy Hodgson takes his seat to watch Manchester United and Tottenham on Sunday . The England squad will be named on Thursday for games against Lithuania and Italy and although Kane is certain to be involved, despite failing to make an impact in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United when his first effort on goal came in the 89th minute. Spurs defended terribly and were killed off by three first-half goals before completing the game in something of a daze as United coasted home and it damages their hopes of finishing in the top four and reaching the Champions League. Mauricio Pochettino dubbed it the worst performance since he arrived at White Hart Lane last summer and promised to examine what went wrong before they return to action against Leicester on Saturday. Marouane Fellaini buries this chance for United's opener inside the first 10 minutes despite Eric Dier's tackle . Manager Mauricio Pochettino (left) attempted to change Tottenham's fortunes by replacing Townsend . The Tottenham defence were in disarray as Michael Carrick has the time to head in for Manchester United . 'I am not disappointed with the result but I am worried about the performance,' said Pochettino. 'You can lose here but the performance was very poor. We need to analyse and try to fix that. We're all disappointed. Not only me. But all the team. We need to understand why it happened. We need to fix it. That maybe the poorest we've played this season. 'We came, ready to compete but from the beginning it was difficult. We didn't play our normal way. The first half was poor and at 3-0 it is difficult to come back. 'We tried to play forward as is our philosophy, but it is difficult when you concede and make a lot of mistakes. Individually and collectively, we were very poor and that's why we lost the game. The key factor was us. We were the key factor in the game. Wayne Rooney celebrates compounding Tottenham's misery, scoring the third goal at Old Trafford . 'We didn't deliver a good performance. We made a lot of mistakes. We never found our way to play and allowed Manchester United to play.' Townsend was hauled off after half an hour and replaced by Mousa Dembele as Pochettino tried to get hold of possession as they were being over-run by United in midfield. 'It was not because Andros was poor,' he said. 'We tried to change to keep the ball.' Soon after the switch, a mistake by Nabil Bentaleb presented Wayne Rooney with the third goal and Tottenham's fate was sealed before the break. Mason also came off, early in the second half with a 'knock' while Emmanuel Adebayor returned for his first appearance since January as a late substitute. Adebayor was back in the squad because Roberto Soldado hurt his knee in training, on Saturday. Pochettino said Soldado's injury was 'not serious'. VIDEO Top four still possible - Pochettino .

"A man who had occupied a cypress tree for 11 days to block construction of a premier golf course in New Orleans' large public park has fallen from the tree and injured himself. The man, identified as Jonathan Boover, who goes by Lloyd, fell out of the tree in City Park on Tuesday morning. Christopher Lane of the City Park for Everyone Coalition says Boover apparently had not eaten in a day and was disoriented from lack of sleep. Hold on: Jonathan Boover, who goes by the name Lloyd, fell from this cypress tree in City Park, New Orleans, on Tuesday, 11 days after first climbing the tree to protest a new golf course . Protest: Boover was trying to draw attention to the 100 or more trees that are being torn down in City Park, to clear the way for a new $24.5 million golf course . Injured: Jonathan 'Lloyd' Boover is believed to have broken his ankle and nose after falling from the tree . Construction: Work is currently underway at the park for a new golf course, which will cost $24.5 million cut down 100 trees in the area . Lane says Boover believed he may have broken an ankle and his nose in the fall. Sheriff's deputies had been monitoring Boover's protest and kept a spotlight trained on him at night. He was expected to be charged with trespassing. Boover said he was happy to 'spend a few days in jail' if it meant more people would hear about the $24.5 million golf course being built along park along Harrison Avenue. About 100 trees will be chopped down for the course. Boover says there was already a gold course in the park, and that the trees shouldn't need to be demolished. Scene: Emergency crews at City Park Tuesday after Jonathan 'Lloyd' Boover fell from this tree . Demonstration: Boover said he was more than willing to spend time in jail in order to draw people's attention to the trees that are being destroyed in the park . Wild is Free: Boover snuck into the construction on Friday March 13 . Broover, along with a friend known as 'Heart', jumped the green fence that surrounds the construction site last on March 13. He scaled the oak tree in the rain while workers couldn't see. 'These are old growth trees and they are trying to degrade them,' Heart told NOLA.com. Boover was believed to have been waving to one of many fans that had congregated to wish him well when he flipped out his hammock and fell to the ground. 'I said ''Hi, Lloyd'',' the woman said. 'He waved and hit the ground.' Boover immediately got back in the tree, however then realized he needed medical attention. Emergency crews were called to the park and he was taken to hospital.","Jonathan 'Lloyd' Boover scaled the fence of City Park in New Orleans on March 13 and climbed a cypress tree .

"Today Show host Karl Stefanovic has risked a backlash after trying out his best sledge against a group of cricket fans ahead of India's World Cup semi-final against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Stefanovic asked the team of India supporters: 'Who’s going to be manning 7-Elevens today?' 'I'm not sure about who's going to be manning 7-Elevens but you might have to look at Centrelink as well I think, Karl,' one of the fans hilariously retorted, owning the presenter with their response. Scroll down for video . Karl Stefanovic asked a team of India supporters: 'Who’s going to be manning 7-Elevens today?' The comeback caused an uproar of laughter in the Today Show studio, as Stefanovic said: 'What are you going to say to Warner?' Australian cricketer Dave Warner was famously fined 50 per cent of his match fee after he told Indian batsman Rohit Sharma to 'speak English' at the MCG in January. 'Look I'm not sure we can repeat that stuff on TV this early in the morning,' the India fan smiled. 'We'll definitely be right into him that's for sure. We'll definitely be speaking in English so he understands,' the India fan said. Viewers quickly reacted to Stefanovic's 7-Eleven question on social media, with some labelling it 'tasteless'. One of the India fans (right) fired back telling Stefanovic he should be concerned as Centrelink will be empty of Australians as they all watch the cricket . Viewers quickly reacted to Stefanovic's 7-Eleven question on social media, calling it 'inappropriate and offensive' Andy Cussen asked: 'How does Karl Stefanovic still have a job? Complete muppet.' Megan Maurice said: 'You know, you just start to think that maybe Karl Stefanovic isn't that bad after all and then...' Angus Roberts described his comments as 'bit of a tasteless ""joke""'. And Paul Nolan said: 'I'm usually a fan of Karl Stefanovic but his 7-11 quip today was inappropriate and offensive.' Andy Cussen asked: 'How does Karl Stefanovic still have a job? Complete muppet.'

"It was only fitting that a former Hearts man should help to finally send the Championship title to Tynecastle. After all, this entire season deserves to be coloured maroon. Yet it was not only a favour to his first love that Lee Wallace performed at Easter Road. In scoring the crucial, confidence-building opening goal for Rangers, he also delivered an immensely valuable prize to his current employers. For the Ibrox side, games against Hibernian this term have been akin to a sadistically extended form of torture. Three successive defeats had delivered a crushing 9-1 aggregate. One more on Sunday and it was an historic clean sweep. It would also have delayed Hearts’ inevitable coronation for at least another six days. Lee Wallace (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after giving Rangers the lead away to Hibernian . Hibernian XI: Oxley, Gray (Watson - 45), Hanlon, Fontaine. Stevenson, Fyvie, Robertson (Stanton - 78), MGeouch, Allan, Malonga, Dja Djedje (Boyle - 69) Subs not used: Forster, Craig, Handling, Perntreou . Booked: Gray . Rangers XI: Bell, McGregor, McCulloch, Mohsni, Zaliukas, Wallace; Murdoch, Law, Shiels (Black - 75); Clark, Miller (Vuckic - 83) Subs not used: Robinson, Hutton, Black, Daly, Templeton, Sinnamon . Goals: Wallace 44, Miller 80 . Booked: Murdoch, Miller . Wallace, though, had different ideas. Freed to attack almost at will in a new 3-5-2 formation set up by Stuart McCall, he delivered a barnstorming display on the left flank. After speaking so openly on Friday about how this had been a season of professional and personal torment, here was an emphatic reminder of just how forceful a player he can be. Others in blue followed his lead. Kenny Miller scored a highly controversial clincher ten minutes from the end — when refereeing headline-magnet Willie Collum ignored Hibs’ claims for a foul by Wallace — but, in truth, this was a victory that had foundations laid long before kick-off. So often in recent times, Rangers fans have lamented the perceived lack of tactical thinking from those resident in the technical area. McCall, though, turned up in Leith and did a number on Hibs to secure the first triumph of his three-match reign. It did not go unnoticed. Kenny Miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for Rangers and close the gap on Hibernian . ‘Stuart McCall’s blue-and-white army’ was the chant from the visiting support as the minutes ticked down. McCall’s hopes of remaining in situ beyond the end of the season may well hinge on winning promotion. If that is to become a reality, then he will need many more days like this one. Overall, this was just a second win in 10 games for Rangers but it lifted them to within three points of their hosts, with a game in hand. They now have renewed hope of finishing second and reducing their play-off schedule in the fight to follow Hearts up. Hibs’ 15-match unbeaten run is at an end but Stubbs is adamant this will not derail the momentum they have steadily built since the turn of the year. Building momentum is now McCall’s (pictured) aim — after he recognised something different had to be attempted against Hibs if Rangers were not to face the inevitably of yet another defeat. His ploy was to move to three centre-backs, with Marius Zaliukas and Bilel Mohsni flanking captain Lee McCulloch. It was hardly a trio to inspire confidence in the visiting support, given their ropey individual performances this term, yet the hope was that weight of numbers would help stifle the hosts in central areas and allow Darren McGregor and Wallace to advance as wing-backs. It worked, and contributed to a fractured opening period in which clear sights of goal were at a premium. Wallace slams home the opener just before half-time to put the away side in control at Easter Road . The Easter Road side had the first, thanks to a majestic, deep cross hit with pace and accuracy from the left flank by Dylan McGeouch. Liam Fontaine had remained upfield from an earlier free-kick but couldn’t cash in on that gamble as he powered a header wide of target. That was, though, as good as it got for Hibs in the first half as they encountered a Rangers line-up displaying a renewed level of organisation. That such a trait was noticeable says much about what went before. It wasn’t bringing about a huge amount in the way of free-flowing entertainment but this at least now looked more like a toe-to-toe contest between well-matched opponents. Nicky Law set up Dean Shiels — back on his old stomping ground — to slice one over the top from the fringe of the penalty area. Then David Gray was caught out as Rangers broke forward and was forced to haul down Wallace around 25 yards out. Collum punished him with a yellow card before Law stepped up to whip the resultant free-kick a couple of feet too high. A couple of set-piece exchanges then caused flickers of threat at either end. It would, though, be the visitors who took the lead two minutes ahead of the interval via a goal made possible by McCall’s rejig. The move started at the feet of the oft-mocked Mohsni, who had the presence of mind to spot that Gray was out of position. A long, raking pass found Nicky Clark scampering into the space he had left behind. Clark stepped on the brakes to switch to his right foot and sling a cross along the six-yard line. Kenny Miller couldn’t connect with a little attempted back-flick before McGregor was denied by a terrific blocking challenge from Lewis Stevenson. The ball broke loose and Wallace, who had stormed into the area to support his fellow wing-back, managed to scoop a shot high into the net despite desperate attempts to close him down. Kenny Miller celebrates his goal with the fans during his side's win . It was the first time Rangers had taken the lead against Hibs on Championship duty and only the second goal they had managed during 313 minutes of this fixture. The question was whether they could hold onto the advantage they had finally gained. Stubbs sought to fix one fault in his set-up when he replaced the injured Gray, who had endured a pretty difficult first half, with Keith Watson. Yet the pattern of play remained similar after the restart. It was tense, often scrappy, and with the Ibrox side winning marginally more of the numerous little battles. The game found fresh impetus after the hour-mark, however, as each side let slip a prime opportunity. It was Rangers up first, with Mohnsi feeding Miller, whose angled ball set up Clark. He couldn’t sort out his feet quick enough, allowing paul Hanlon to block the strike. Seconds later, Franck Dja Djedje found himself clear in the inside-right channel after the visiting defence was caught out. The angled shot was on, but Dja Djedje tried to square for sidekick Dominique Malonga and Zaliukas intercepted. At last, there was a stretched, open look to the game. Clark was denied space to finish at the near post after another surging run from Wallace. Hibs looked to press back but saw their hopes extinguished in rancorous fashion. Wallace looked to play a one-two with Miller, but it seemed Hanlon had beaten him to the return pass before they collided. The centre-back crashed to the deck claiming a foul, before Easter Road erupted in astonished fury as Collum waved play on. The rest of the home defence seemed to freeze, expecting the free-kick, but Miller was unperturbed as he gathered possession before cracking a shot past Mark Oxley.","Lee Wallace scored the opening goal for Rangers after 44 minutes .

"An American teenager charged over the death of Australian baseballer Chris Lane has been handed a life sentence after he pleaded guilty to the random drive-by killing in 2013. Michael Jones, who was charged along with two other US teenagers, will not be eligible for parole until he is 56-years-old. Jones, who was the driver of the car from which a bullet was fired at Lane, begged for forgiveness as he was sentenced a minimum of 38 years in prison, the ABC reports. Lane, 22, from Melbourne, was shot in the back on August 16, 2013, in what police said was a random killing as he ran along a road in Duncan, southern Oklahoma, where he was on a sporting scholarship. American Michael Dewayne Jones has been sentenced to life in prison after he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for his involvement in the killing of Christopher Lane . The two other teens, charged with first-degree murder and accessory in the first, will face court next month. They were 17 and 16 at the time of the baseballer’s death. In December 2013, in the first courageous interview since her son’s death, Lane’s mother Donna Lane told the Daily Mail she doesn’t care what happens to the teens charged with killing her son. 'It's not going to bring my Chris back,' she said. Ms Lane told how she had shed tears every day for her only son, admitting that even though he had been living in the US for the past four years her life in Melbourne has been empty knowing he's never coming back for a visit. At her home in the suburb of Pascoe Vale, lying between Melbourne city centre and the airport, Donna opened a photograph album put together as a special memorial for her by his friends in the US.

'He was always good with the ball almost as soon as he could walk,' she said, turning the pages, smiling at one of him poking his tongue out at the camera. 'I'm not at all surprised he ended up as such a talented player. 'I know that his friends see him as a brilliant catcher and while he might be a super-hero to them he's still my son and what strikes me all the time is that even though he's so special I can't have him back. 'People ask me all the time what I think about the three who have been arrested in connection with his murder. But do you know what - I don't care.

How is it going to change things for me and my family? 'My friends tell me that if those three do walk free they might do it again, you know, hurt somebody else, but whatever happens over there now still doesn't affect me in any way whatsoever.

"Spain boss Vicente del Bosque has left the door open for the return of David Villa to the national team despite the striker stepping down following the side's dismal exit from the World Cup. The former Barcelona ace, now New York City's marquee star in the MLS, said that his games in Brazil would be his last for Spain but the 97-cap veteran could yet lead the line again under Del Bosque. Del Bosque told Spanish radio that there is no reason Villa, 33, couldn't reach 100 caps because he had 'done so much for the national team' and has kept the door open for him to return. David Villa, on target here for New York City at Yankee Stadium, could still return to the Spain national team . Spain coach Vincente del Bosque says Villa doesn't have to have played his last international games . 'There are exceptional cases and one of those is David,' said Del Bosque of the player who was instrumental in Spain's triumphs at Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup. Nevertheless he isn't with the Spain squad for Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Ukraine and their friendly in the Netherlands four days later with Juventus's Alvaro Morata and Malaga's Juanmi, who is yet to receive his first cap, the only strikers at Del Bosque's disposal. Villa has 59 goals in his 97 appearances for the full national team, but managed just one in their disappointing departure in the group stage of the World Cup in Brazil - the opener in Spain's 3-0 win in their dead rubber against Australia. Villa's goals and influence were instrumental in Spain's Euro 2008 and 2010 World Cup victories . Del Bosque, at a sponsors announcement on Tuesday, said Villa was an 'exceptional case'' for Spain . He's impressed in his opening matches as captain for New York City, for which he was the club's first-ever signing.

"Olivier Giroud might have played a key role in Arsenal's Champions League exit against Monaco, but the French forward's form otherwise is as good as any other striker in Europe. Only Lionel Messi can match his statistics in 2015. Giroud has 11 goals in 15 games so far this calendar year, a ratio that puts him ahead of Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo as one of Europe's leading marksmen and his strikes have helped Arsenal to become the Barclays Premier League's form team. Their French centre forward's impressive streak has helped Arsenal move to within a point of second-placed Manchester City and they look all-but certain to qualify for the Champions League in one of the most competitive battles for the top four in recent years. Olivier Giroud has been in fine form for Arsenal so far in 2015, notching 11 goals in just 15 appearances . Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid's prolific forward, has a lower goals per game rate than Giroud in 2015 . Player . Appearances . Goals . Goals/game . Giroud . 15 . 11 . 0.73 . Ronaldo . 15 . 10 . 0.66 . Ronaldo and Messi are generally seen as unachievable benchmarks for most players in terms of goalscoring, but Giroud is holding his own with the Portuguese forward. Messi, though, has 20 in 19 games averaging 0.95 goals per game. Even the prolific Harry Kane at north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur cannot quite match Giroud. His 13 goals in 18 games in 2015 giving him a rate of 0.72, just slightly lower than the 28-year-old Frenchman. After scoring both goals in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Newcastle United, Giroud's efforts are being appreciated by his manager as well as his critics. Giroud gets ahead of Newcastle defender Mike Williamson to score the first of his two goals at the weekend . The French striker scored a second goal within four minutes, nodding in a corner with ease . Asked if Giroud is world-class, manager Arsene Wenger said: 'I think so and he is scoring the goals to prove it. But I believe there is still room for improvement. 'Technically, he is a much better player than he was. His touch, his link play, his finishing, they have all improved. If you saw footage of him when he first arrived and now, it is obvious he is a better player. 'He is a fighter as well and a player with good mental strength. At 22 or 23 he played in Division Three in France, and now he is at Arsenal.' Arsene Wenger now ranks Giroud as world-class and says he has improved since joining Arsenal . Giroud blows a kiss at full time against Newcastle, and his form has earned him a lot of love of late .","Olivier Giroud has a better goals per game ratio than Cristiano Ronaldo .

"Michel Platini has backed Football Association chairman Greg Dyke's plan to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12. Dyke is facing opposition to his plans from the Premier League but UEFA president Platini said the European body would work to help him. It comes as Dyke said it was 'depressing' to read Rio Ferdinand's newspaper column claiming that managers such as Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho may not be giving young English players a chance. UEFA president Michel Platini agrees with Gerg Dyke's plans to increase number of homegrown players . The FA chairman wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12 . While there is a slight increase in the number of English players in the Premier League this year — up from 32% last year to 35% — that is largely down to Burnley being promoted. If they were to be relegated and replaced by Watford — second in the Championship — the proportion would fall to 31%. However, only 22% of the starters in the current top four teams are qualified to play for England, compared to 28% last year. In 2014, just 23 English players appeared in the Champions League group stage, compared with 78 Spaniards, 55 Germans and 51 Brazilians. This season the three English clubs that reached the knockout stages of the Champions League started only 10 English players, compared to 12 French and nine Spanish in those three sides. In the last two weeks only five English players started in the second legs of the knockout stage. In 2010 England Under 17s won the European Championship, beating Spain in the final. Of that 18-man match-day squad, only four have gone on to play more than 20 top-flight games, while double that from the Spanish squad have done so in La Liga. Of the 12 clubs who have played in each of the last five Premier League seasons, the average number of home-grown players per squad has gone from 11.4 to 9.4. Only 62% of current home-grown players are qualified to play for England. Platini, speaking after the UEFA Congress in Vienna, said: 'This is a position we defend. We're not only talking about England, we're talking all of Europe. Mr Dyke's struggle with the FA is something we share and we agree with him. 'With the new leader of the European Commission it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect home-grown, grass-roots young players in the different countries. We share the same perspective. We will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one. 'There is free flow of workers but there are some things that doesn't work well and we need to address it.' UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino admitted that its similar rule of eight home-grown players in European squads was not working as well as it should and called Dyke's initiative 'fantastic'. He added: 'We are at eight out of 25 and we see it is not really as great as it should be so whatever move in favour of increasing home-grown players is something we can only support. Congratulations to England.' Dyke's proposals are set to be discussed at a Premier League chairmen's meeting on Thursday as well as the FA board. They also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than 21. The FA chairman said: 'I thought Rio Ferdinand's column was in some ways quite depressing. It virtually said Mourinho is virtually saying he is not going to play the kids anyway. Why have an academy then? 'It's not fair on the kids. It was always tough for kids to get through but it seems unfair now.' Asked if he had looked at how the FA could force the new rules through despite opposition, he replied: 'We have but that's not the way we want to go. We have looked at it yes.' Former England defender Rio Ferdinand claimed that youngsters were not being given a chance at Chelsea . Chelsea' s Ruben Loftus-Cheek is highly rated but has found chances limited under Jose Mourinho . Dyke said all the proposals were open for discussion. He added: 'I think it's more about the clubs than the leadership if you want my honest opinion. It's the unfairness of a system that is massively improved because of the EPPP (Elite Player Performance Plan) which was introduced by the Premier League led by Richard Scudamore, he has done a great job. 'The trouble is that it is only any good if the kids get through the system - if they can't get through the system why bother? 'We are open to discussions on all of it. This is a set of ideas which we think will work.'","FA chairman proposed raising the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12 at Premier League clubs .

"To play for Scotland at Hampden, Shaun Maloney will fly 500 miles. Then add a zero on the end. When Chicago Fire’s visit to the new home of San Jose Earthquakes ended in defeat on Sunday night, the 32-year-old confronted the reality of life in Major League Soccer. A 5,000 mile journey from California to Glasgow, lasting the best part of a day, for a midweek friendly with Northern Ireland followed by a Euro qualifier against Gibraltar. The crowds for both games will be modest. The financial rewards non-existent. Shaun Maloney made the 5,000 mile trip from Chicago to Glasgow in order to represent his country . Scotland international Maloney, pictured scoring against the Republic of Ireland, loves playing for his country . Scotland are just three points behind Group D leaders Poland in the race to qualify for Euro 2016 . Yet it only took a five-minute call to Gordon Strachan to convince him the jetlag was worth it. That the arrangement can work. ‘We had a conversation, which was pretty brief,’ said the man whose stunning goal against Ireland invigorated Scotland’s latest qualifying campaign. ‘But although it was brief, it was really important for me. ‘I asked him if it would have any detrimental effect on my international career (moving to the States) and he said, “No”. That was all I needed to know. ‘I absolutely love playing for my country. It makes me very, very proud and it’s an honour to do it and I will try my hardest to continue to make the squad no matter what league I am in.’ How he might feel when the air miles mount is another matter. There were closer options. Significantly easier ways to add more caps to the display cabinet. Leaving troubled, relegation threatened Wigan in January, there was a firm offer from Leicester City. Speaking during Celtic’s winter break to Gran Canaria, Ronny Deila had also expressed an interest in taking him back to Parkhead. ‘I think the quotes by the Celtic manager were just him being very polite about me as a player,’ claimed Maloney. ‘I was a previous Celtic player. I didn’t think there was too much else in it. ‘There were options to stay in England, but I spoke to the manager and the owner in Chicago and I think my mind was pretty much made up in January. Maloney rejected interest from England and Scotland in order to seal a move to MLS outfit Chicago Fire . ‘You have to respect any club that offers you a contract in England or Scotland. But I really wanted to try this.’ He had been around the block in England and Scotland many times. Two spells at Celtic left nothing new to discover, other than a landscape with no Old Firm games. At Aston Villa and Wigan, he had also been seen the contrasts of English football, winning an FA Cup medal before flirting with a relegation battle in the Championship. A £750,000 move to Leicester was close, but fell down. Chicago’s Magnificent Mile and Sears Tower were always appealing options. ‘I have always thought about playing in this league,’ he continued. ‘I think the timing just worked. It’s a completely different lifestyle, everything is new. The stadiums, the clubs I am playing against, everything. It’ s all very exciting. ‘We had a disappointing year as a club last season and the play-offs are our ambition this year. I don’t think it’s beyond us.’ The early signs suggest otherwise. After three matches, Maloney has yet to play in a winning team and crossing the Atlantic to face Northern Ireland in a friendly is a big commitment. Without a point in the Eastern Conference, Fire host Philadelphia Union hours after Scotland’s qualifier with Gibraltar on Sunday without one of their prized, high-profile designated players. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Maloney insisted: ‘I will always make myself available for Scotland. Maloney (left, pictured with Steven Naismith) is pleased to be playing under Scotland boss Gordon Strachan . ‘We will cross the friendlies bridge as we come to it.’ His respect for the manager is a factor. Effusive in his praise of Strachan, his former Celtic manager, Maloney has new enthusiasm for international football, admitting: ‘Look, the manager has been excellent. ‘I wouldn’t want to disrespect Craig Levein the previous manager at all. But the impact Gordon Strachan has had has been monumental. ‘The players have bought into the system that he wants and we have some outstanding players in Steven Fletcher and Steven Naismith at Everton. ‘I would probably put Scott Brown in that same category and then beyond that our manager is our biggest asset. We are very fortunate to have him.’ Asked if this is the best Scotland team in 20 years or so he is blunt. Technically, there have been better players in dark blue. Yet Strachan’s organisational skills and tactical nous are doing a decent job of covering up the cracks on the surface. ‘Individually, we have probably had better players – or players playing at a higher level and more of them,’ he said. ‘But as a group and as a team there is a feeling about it I haven’t had in quite a long time. Scotland are currently preparing for their upcoming matches against Northern Ireland and Gibraltar . ‘We are a good side. We played very well against Ireland and were brought down to earth a little bit against England. ‘But we have to realise what our strengths are and our weaknesses and try to get better. ‘Germany are still favourites to qualify. Poland second and after that it’s between us, Ireland and Georgia for a spot in the top two and if not third and a play-off. ‘Scotland against Ireland in Dublin is a big, big game and the result will have big ramifications for the group – as any game does now. ‘Ireland are strong at home and Poland were very good in Warsaw, as well. ‘I couldn’t call it, I really couldn’t.’ There was a brief exchange with San Jose’s Glasgow-born coach Dominic Kinnear before the long journey home. Kenny Miller found the travel from Vancouver in Canada gruelling. Chicago is less northerly when it comes to flying to venues like California, yet San Jose was still a 4,000 mile round trip. ‘You never know where and when things can change in this game,’ he admitted. ‘I’ve only spent a short time in Chicago, but it’s a great sporting city, it is going to be a massive lifestyle change and I am looking forward to it. ‘I want to be part of a team which makes the city proud. And an international team that makes the country proud.’","Shaun Maloney made the 5,000 mile journey from California to Glasgow .

"A bust of Vladmir Putin, depicting the Russian leader dressed as a Roman emperor, is to be unveiled in St Petersburg. The Roman-style statue is being gifted by St.Petersburg’s fiercely nationalist Cossack community to commemorate the allies’ victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War. The comparison of the strongman with the leaders of ancient Rome was in-part inspired by Putin’s decision to back pro-Russian separatists in the Ukraine,Newsweek reported. The clay mould was designed by a St. Petersburg sculptor, backed by the city's popular Cossack community . The bust is at the St Petersburg's Academy of arts, ahead to its unveiling at an underground station . St Petersburg’s traditionalist Cossack group Irbis, a popular organisation supporting Slavic military values, said the bust of Putin will be placed at an underground station in north St Petersburg. The city, formally Leningrad, is Putin’s home town. The bust’s designer, sculptor Pavel Greshnikov, was quoted as saying he had considered portraying the Russian leader in a suit and tie, in military fatigues and even in medieval armour. The statue is complete with a laurel wreath and other trappings of the Roman Empire. It is at Greshinov’s workshop at the St Petersburg Academy of arts, ahead to its unveiling. Putin may have upset some people with his Ukrainian activities, but in his hometown he is still popular . Cossacks have grown in popularity in Russian since the fall of communism in the 80s and 90s. The group, which prides itself on military valour and its Russian Orthodox Christian roots, has particularly warmed to Putin’s increasingly traditional values. Andrey Polykov, a local Cossack leader in St Petersburg, backed the creation of the Putin Statue. Lenin was commemorated in bronze throughout the USSR. However in many places the statues were torn down after the fall of communism . He was quoted as saying the Russian leader was one of the country’s ‘brightest’ and most ‘positive’ heads of state for ‘the last hundred years or so’. Polykov claimed Putin had a record as a peacemaker following wars in Georgia in 2008 and Moldova in the early 1990s. Boris Yeltsin, Putin’s predecessor, has also been immortalised in sculpture. A statue of the post-Soviet leader was erected in Yekaterinburg in 2011. Andrey Polyakov said his Cossack community had been planning for a long time to erect the Putin statue .","Vladmir Putin to be shown in a laurel wreath and a wearing a Roman tunic .

"A former footballer alleged to have fronted a £30 million investment scheme which led to Premier League stars losing money racked up a 39,000 euro bar bill in just four hours at a lavish beach party, it is claimed. Michael McIndoe, 35, is accused of taking huge sums from top players, including £500,000 from each of Robbie Keane and Jimmy Bullard, for the failed venture. The former Wolves and Coventry midfielder, from Edinburgh, is due in bankruptcy court on Wednesday as his creditors, including other big names, chase him for money. Former footballer Michael McIndoe (circled), who fronted an alleged £30 million investment scheme which left Premier League stars out of pocket, is said to have racked up a 39,000 euro bar bill at a beach party similar to this one . The receipt, allegedly from one of McIndoe's beach parties at Marbella's famous Ocean Club has emerged, reportedly showing how before he declared himself bankrupt, he had splashed the cash to try to attract investors. He is pictured here, with a cigar, in 2011 . Now a receipt allegedly from one of McIndoe's beach parties at Marbella's famous Ocean Club has emerged, reportedly showing how before he declared himself bankrupt, he had splashed the cash at the bar as he tried to impress investors. The bill for 38,778.30 euros, worth around £28,600, shows magnums of Cristal and bottles of Champagne and is from 2011, although a copy was printed off in July 2013 by a member of staff. It also details the 3,525.30 euro service charge. The receipt, allegedly from one of McIndoe's parties, shows a 38,778.30 euro bar bill, including five magnums of Cristal Champagne. This copy was printed off in 2013, although the bill is from 2011 . One onlooker present claims McIndoe and his entourage had been gathered around the pool on two sunbeds in the venue's prestigious VIP section. 'They got 20 women and out of them they were all carrying two bottles each of champagne, but big 15 litre ones, Cristal – you name it,' he said. 'There are beds around the pool and all the girls brought them to the bed and they were sprayed everywhere – all to make him look like the boss. 'It is the largest beach club in the world, with a massive bar and pool in the middle and was renowned for its top quality parties. 'McIndoe had come there a couple of times. It was a holiday to treat some of the boys he was with. 'The end of that weekend before he went he was just there – he wanted to have a big show and try to get more investors. He was asking for the best people, the richest. 'It was a party to show people ""look this is what I've got -  you could have this lifestyle"". 'He sprayed half of the bottles for the first five minutes and then sprayed again. He wanted to make sure that people saw that he was there. He stayed there for the whole afternoon. 'McIndoe doesn't drink himself but his guests were worse for wear by the end of it. 'After that day I am told he never went back – he did his sales pitch and moved on.' McIndoe is alleged to have persuaded footballers to invest in the scheme, then blew a fortune on women, cars, houses and holidays before bankruptcy. Investors reportedly lost a combined £30 million when the scheme collapsed in late 2011. The scheme is currently being investigated by police, while McIndoe has a bankruptcy hearing this week after previously telling the court that he was living off the generosity of friends and family. A spokesman from the Metropolitan police confirmed to MailOnline that an allegation of fraud was made to Westminster CID in February last year. No arrests have been made. At the height of his spending, McIndoe hired a modernist £2million mansion for £27,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree in Marbella. His friends had bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs, while back in London he hired pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme. The scheme is thought to have attracted 300 players, including a number from the lower leagues, and he told original investors to get others involved so they could make more money. McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays. Former players Bullard, who recently appeared on the TV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! and Robbie Keane are thought to have lost more than £500,000 each. 'He had the gift of the gab but was very cagey about the scheme, saying the money was in property, gold or City investments,' added the player, who declined to be named. 'People were convinced when they saw him paying out but then he suddenly closed the scheme down. He kept telling me to wait and that I would be a wealthy man.' McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £3 million and he told told the court in London at a hearing last month that he was penniless. McIndoe said he had no income and was living off £13,900 surplus from the sale of his mother's house but £6,000 of that had been given to his girlfriend, who lives in Epping, Essex. 'That money has been running thin of late so I have been getting help from friends and family,' he told the hearing. Insolvency practitioners O’Haras Ltd, based in West Yorkshire, are trustees of his bankruptcy estate and the firm's director has said it is looking to recover money lost through McIndoe's gambling habits. Details of his account with bookmakers' William Hill, which were given to receivers as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, showed he had staked a total of £391,955 and his winnings were £309,505.76.

He added that he was not working and was living with his mother in Edinburgh or staying with a friend in London. After the hearing, he faced accusations from creditors that he had not responded to their questions about repayment. 'I have nothing to say, I cannot comment about this,' he said. However, the Spanish onlooker said he had little sympathy for McIndoe – only his alleged victims. He added: 'What he is accused of doing to these people is an absolute joke. 'He took a lot of money off a lot of people. We are not talking thousands – we are talking millions.' McIndoe celebrates scoring for Doncaster against Arsenal in the League Cup in 2005 . McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then took advantage of the Bulls' financial plight and snapped him up for £25,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for £50,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for £250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons.","Michael McIndoe convinced footballers to take part in investment scheme .

"The saying 'just when you think something is idiot proof they invent a new idiot' was proven again this week when a man set fire to his car after using a cigarette lighter to see while filling it with a jerry can. In the early hours of Sunday morning a man from Sunshine in Victoria ran out of fuel about one kilometre east of Ararat on the Western Highway. He went on foot to a local petrol station to get a jerry can but could not see what he was doing when he returned to the car. Cars have gone up in flames for a variety of reasons, but setting one on fire because the person was using a cigarette lighter to see while filling it with a jerry can has to be the worst one yet . ABC reports that Acting Inspector Brendan Broadbent said the man lost all common sense when trying to find a solution to the problem. ‘Because there was no light he's actually, in the process of pouring fuel into his vehicle, he's used his lighter to light up the area so he could see,’ he said. Police said the man abandoned common sense in the search for a solution to filling his car with the jerry can in the dark . ‘Subsequently the fumes have ignited and the vehicle's caught on fire.’ The rear of the car was burnt but Acting Inspector Broadbent said the man was lucky to escape without injury. ‘That could have been far worse.’","A man from Sunshine in Victoria ran out of fuel on the Western Highway .

"Peter Quillin has described how the death of his uncle last month will inspire him to dethrone WBO middleweight king Andy Lee when they clash in Brooklyn on April 11. With the New Yorker's dad in prison, uncle Eric Munson had been Quillin's father figure until he lost his fight with cancer five weeks ago. Undefeated 'Kid Chocolate' was already a week into his camp in preparation to fight Lee and, on the advice of his family, he did not break ranks in order to attend his uncle's funeral. Former middleweight world champion Peter Quillin action against Lukas Konecny last year . But Quillin says he was inspired by the visit he made to be by his uncle's side just a week before he died and has warned Lee that he is 'highly motivated' for this fight as a result of it. The 31-year-old said: 'He was the most important person to me in my whole life and it's the first time I've ever lost anybody that close to me. 'When I saw him fighting on his deathbed with cancer, I saw him fight through that until he had nothing left in the tank to fight with. 'That showed me the fight is all in your head. There's no cancer here so I have to do what's worth while I'm still here on this earth. 'I couldn't attend his funeral because I was here in camp. When I saw him it was the week before I started camp and the week after he died. My family told me he would've wanted me to stay in camp. I knew he was proud of me.' Quillin is facing Lee for the title the Irishman won by stopping highly-fancied Matt Korobov in Las Vegas last December. Quillin recently lost his uncle after a battle with cancer but did not interrupt his training to attend the funeral . That night, the pair clashed for the vacant title because Quillin vacated instead of facing Korobov, who had been made his mandatory challenger. As such, the American, who is of Cuban descent, did not lose his title in the ring but insists he no longer feels like the champion. He added: 'I'm going to let Andy have the pressure on him to perform like the champion. I had that pressure but now I have pressure of being a challenger.' Lee and Quillin almost crossed swords three years ago when a fight at Madison Square Garden was mooted as part of the bill on which Matthew Macklin faced Sergio Martinez at Madison Square Garden. Now they will finally meet, across New York at the Barclays Center, and Lee recalled why the fight never happened in 2012. He said: 'I remember when it was proposed at the the time, [former trainer] Emanuel [Steward] turned the fight down because he felt it should have been me fighting Martinez instead of Macklin. 'On top of that they put me in the fight with Quillin on the undercard. They wanted me and Peter to have the hard fight. Lee won his middleweight world title by beating Matt Korobov in Las Vegas last December . Lee celebrates winning his world title . 'Now you have two big middleweights, big for the weight, two genuine punchers and two very good boxers. We match well and it will come down to whoever implements their plan better on the night. We have a plan and we're working on it.' In Lee's last two victories – the win over Korobov and the Knockout of the Year contender against John Jackson in June – the 30-year-old from Limerick has been behind on the scorecards but turned the fight on its head with a single shot. But Lee added: 'At no time in those fights did I feel I was going to lose. I knew at some stage we would have to trade. With the power I carry I know we will have to trade in a 12-round fight and I just know if I land at the right time with my power I can knock anybody out. 'It gives you confidence. People got the wrong impression as a blood and guts fighter but I'm a technical boxer.' That technique, as ever, is being honed under the tutelage of Adam Booth in their training base in Beausoleil in the south of France. They operate within walking distance of one of the world's biggest gambling districts in Monte Carlo and Lee recognises that the stakes could not be higher in Brooklyn next month. He said: 'I could've fought in Ireland, chosen the opponent and beaten someone comfortably for my first defence. But if I fight and beat Peter in New York I will be a global star. People will need to acknowledge what I've been doing. It's a great opportunity to fight in America, on national TV and it takes me to the next level.'","Peter Quillin takes on world champion Andy Lee in Brooklyn on April 11 .

"Five hundred to one was the price quoted to optimistic punters who felt Harry Kane had it in him to become the Premier League's top scorer at the beginning of the season. That's not looking such a gamble now. Nineteen goals later during one of the most breathtaking and honest seasons in recent memory, he's level with Diego Costa. Kane is with Roy Hodgson's England squad this week and can lay claim to being the country's only genuinely complete frontman. STATS Scroll down to see a full breakdown of Harry Kane's 19 goals . Harry Kane - pictured scoring against Leicester City on Saturday - has netted 19 times this season . Kane is training with the England team at St George's Park for the first time this week . Kane's goals have come from a variety of angles in what has been a staggering season for Spurs . Graphics were provided by Squawka. His international team-mates who share St George's Park with him in the coming days will doubtless notice the 21-year-old's range of ability. Kane is as comfortable 25 yards from goal as he is in the penalty area – and the visuals of his stunning campaign tell the whole story. Predominantly right-footed, it's little wonder that 10 of his strikers have come that way, but Mauricio Pochettino – and now Hodgson – will be enthused at the other ways in which he finds the net. Kane's spike of goals came around Christmas and he has added more headers and left-footed strikes recently . Kane (celebrating scoring against Aston Villa in November) has been in stunning form for Spurs . Brad Guzan had no chance after Kane's free-kick swerved beyond him at Villa Park . Four have come via his head, with five slammed home with his weaker left peg. Nine goals have been netted from more than 12 yards out. Those include a 29-yard hit in the 5-3 win against Chelsea on New Year's Day, and that stunning swerving free-kick at Aston Villa earlier in November. Compare that to Wayne Rooney, who has 11 for the season - nine of which came with his favoured right. His goals have contributed 22 points to Spurs charge towards the top four, too. Kane's rise to prominence has been staggering and, with five goals in his last three, is in prime position to pip the injured Costa and send the bookies into a sulk.","Harry Kane is level with Chelsea's Diego Costa on 19 goals .

"A 16-year-old girl was arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle $100,000 worth of marijuana into the US from Mexico . The teenager was detained with two women, aged 23 and 24, after officers allegedly found 185 pound haul in their Volkswagen sedan. A narcotics detection dog patrolling the boarder crossing in the Port of Lukesville, Arizona, picked out the vehicle for a secondary search, according to azcentral.com. A 16-year-old girl has been arrested trying to smuggle 12 bags of marijuana into the US from Mexico . Officers from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers examined the car and discovered 12 packages of marijuana. The find was said to be worth an estimated $92,550, according to a spokesman for the CBP. The teenager from Glendale, Arizona, who was reportedly driving the car, and the two women were not named by officials. Both the drugs and the dark coloured sedan were seized as part of the investigation. The trio have now been referred to immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations. Cannabis was legalized in the state of Arizona for medical use in 2010 following a ballot. A growing number of states, including Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Alaska, have voted to allow people to possess limited amounts of marijuana.

"Former Sauber test driver Giedo van der Garde says he has settled his contract dispute with the team for 'significant compensation' while accepting his Formula One career is effectively over. Van der Garde had a deal to be one of the team's race drivers this season, but Sauber did not honour it, and legal judgments in Switzerland and last week in Australia before the season-opening race supported the Dutchman's claims. He said on his Facebook page on Wednesday that the compensation meant 'my rights have finally been recognised and that at least some justice has been done,' but said he was 'sad and disappointed' that his F1 ambitions are over, and still bewildered at Sauber's decision-making. Giedo van der Garde has settled his contract dispute with Sauber for 'significant compensation' The former Sauber test driver accepts that he no longer has a future in Formula One . 'I had hoped at last to be able to show what I am capable of, driving a car for a respected midfield team in the 2015 season,' Van der Garde said. 'This dream has been taken away from me, and I know that my future in Formula 1 is probably over.' The settlement ends a long-running dispute that was a dramatic backdrop to the start of the season last weekend in Melbourne, Australia. Having received the backing of a Swiss employment tribunal, Van der Garde took his case to the local Supreme Court of the state of Victoria, where he won the initial hearing and Sauber's appeal. Pressing his claims further, Van der Garde filed contempt of court charges against the team for not immediately facilitating his installation as a driver in Australia. These charges threatened to impound the team's equipment and possibly lead to the detention of team principal Monisha Kaltenborn. The Dutchman was hoping to race for the team at the season's opening grand prix in Australia . Marcus Ericsson (left) and Felipe Nasr (right) eventually raced in Melbourne and will remain Sauber's drivers . He finally agreed to drop that action, allowing drivers Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson to compete in Melbourne, where the team put in a surprisingly strong performance, with the cars finishing fifth and eighth. Van der Garde said on Wednesday he dropped that contempt of court case because it would have 'wrecked' the team's weekend, and hurt Nasr and Ericsson most of all. 'I decided I did not want to live with that idea, even though it was only the team's management that was responsible for the bizarre situation I found myself in,' Van der Garde said. His career supported through his billionaire father-in-law, he said his sponsor forwarded money to the team during 2014 for a 2015 drive. 'Effectively, it was my sponsor's advanced payments that helped the team survive in 2014,' Van der Garde said. 'Sauber's financial decision-making in this case is bizarre, and makes no sense to me.' The Sauber team produced a surprisingly effective performance in Melbourne finishing fifth and eighth . Van der Garde took his case to the Victoria Supreme Court where judges ruled he should race . He said his experience 'will serve as an example to illustrate what should change, and that new regulations will be implemented to help protect driver rights.' 'There are numerous examples of talented drivers with good intentions, but without the sort of professional support that I have had, who have been broken by Formula 1, and who have seen their careers destroyed.' He said he will pursue opportunities in sports cars and touring cars. VIDEO Hamilton cruises to victory in Australian GP .","Giedo van der Garde has settled dispute for 'significant compensation'

"Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho admits understanding the English language changed his fortunes on the pitch. The France international struggled to settle in during his first 18 months after arriving from Paris Saint-Germain for £18million in the summer of 2013. He made 24 appearances in his first season but never really looked comfortable and this campaign started even worse as he walked out of Anfield after not being selected for September's Merseyside derby and then sustained a thigh injury which sidelined him for three months. Mamadou Sakho (right) says learning the English language has helped him improve at Liverpool . However, since returning in mid-December he has been a virtual ever-present, missing just five matches with another injury, and has made a noticeable improvement. The 25-year-old puts much of that down to him learning English. 'Do I finally feel happy at Liverpool? Yes, I feel good. The most difficult thing has been the language,' he told L'Equipe. 'I am a man of strong character so when I can't express myself I am always frustrated, and if I cannot make myself understood it is even worse. The French centre back has been an ever present for Liverpool in the second half of the season . 'Some people said that I should be speaking French and that would allow me to release the tension a bit, except that when I spoke in French on the pitch nobody understood what I was saying. 'I said to myself: 'This is useless - I really must learn'. It took time but now it is very good.' Sakho has put his fit of pique ahead of the first derby this season behind him and is grateful fans appear to have forgiven him also. 'I said sorry - it is all over,' he added. 'In England the supporters don't hold a grudge. In France, especially, it was talked about a lot negatively.'

"The Australian Grand Prix was nothing short of disastrous for McLaren, despite the fact the team spirit was clearly high before the first race of the season. Pictures of preparations behind the scenes in Melbourne show  replacement driver Kevin Magnussen playing a clever practical joke on his team-mate, Jenson Button. As Button stood on the scales to take his weight ahead of the Formula One curtain-raiser, Magnussen sneakily put his foot on the scale to add an extra few pounds on to Button's weight. Button finished 11th in the Australian Grand Prix and was the only driver not to take a point in the race . Magnussen had engine failure on the formation lap as he deputised for Fernando Alonso . But the images show that Magnussen was caught in the act, as Button turned around to see his team-mate's foot hanging in the air. Magnussen was standing in for Fernando Alonso in the first race of the Formula One season, after Alonso was ruled out of the opener with concussion sustained in a crash in pre-season. The 22-year-old Magnussen was left frustrated by his car at the race, though, as he suffered engine failure on the formation lap. Alonso was absent from the first race of the season as he continues to recover from concussion . Alonso is scheduled to compete in the next race of the season in Malaysia on March 29 . And Button did not have too much more luck. He was the only man to finish the race and not take a point in 11th.

"British Davis Cup player Dan Evans will be fined after failing to turn up for his match at this week’s lower-tier professional event on the Wirral. The 24-year-old from Birmingham, who only a year ago looked set to crack the world’s top 100, has given no explanation for his no-show at the $15,000 Futures level tournament on Merseyside. Evans, tagged the ‘bad boy’ of British tennis, will receive a £350 fine and face more questions about his commitment to a career that at times has shown signs of world-class potential. The ex-British No 2 was due to play Italy’s Salvatore Caruso in Tuesday’s first round, but tournament organisers were alarmed when, in a highly unusual situation at a professional event with ranking points on offer, he was absent at the start of play. Dan Evans will be fined after failing to turn up for his match at this week’s lower-tier pro event on the Wirral . Mystery still surrounded his absence on Thursday, with players and officials in the dark for the reasons why. ‘I can confirm Dan Evans was a no-show and was replaced in the draw,’ said a tournament spokesman. ‘He was timed out according to the standard 15-minute rule.’ With his current ranking of 688, Evans was only just inside the event’s entry cut-off but rang in on Saturday to confirm that he would be participating. It is the last anyone heard from him. It is also understood he withdrew from a non-ranking British Tour event in his hometown of Birmingham last Friday, although that time he did notify officials. Evans, tagged the ‘bad boy’ of British tennis, will receive a £350 fine and faces questions about his future . Only a year ago the 24-year-old from Birmingham looked set to crack the world’s top 100 . It is the latest controversy to hit Evans, generally reckoned to have the most natural ability in Britain after Andy Murray. He has played some outstanding Davis Cup matches for GB and in 2013 nearly made the US Open fourth round. Admitting he sometimes struggles for motivation, Evans has been regularly dropped from LTA funding and reinstated, but is currently without support. After last year’s Wimbledon he suffered knee problems but has played three lower-tier events in the UK this year, with the Wirral set to be his fourth. He is said to have been training well at the high performance centre in Nottingham.

"Brendon McCullum insists he and his New Zealand team are enjoying 'the greatest time of our lives' after a thrilling four-wicket win against South Africa in Auckland saw them reach their first ever World Cup final. Grant Elliott (84 not out) hit a six off the penultimate ball of the match at Eden Park to wrap up victory for the Black Caps, having been set 298 to win via the Duckworth-Lewis method after South Africa amassed 281 for five from their 43 overs following a two-hour rain interruption.

'I've said it time and time again it's the greatest time of our lives as players,' McCullum, who scored 59 from just 26 balls to give the Kiwis a promising start, said on Sky Sports World Cup. 'We're enjoying the experience. It's been an incredible ride all the way through. 'The crowds we've had turn up in New Zealand and support this team and the brand of cricket we're trying to play has been phenomenal so I hope they're all dreaming as much as we are. 'We've got a huge occasion in a few days' time. Geez, it'd be nice to win it.'

"Australia have no intention of shirking the verbal battle as they seek to defeat defending champions India in their World Cup semi-final in Sydney. Michael Clarke's team already know that fellow tournament co-hosts New Zealand will await Thursday's winners in Sunday's final at the MCG. Resurgent India, like the Kiwis so far unbeaten throughout their campaign, are sure to provide a stern test as Australia pursue a record fifth title. Mitchell Johnson (centre) will not shirk the verbal battle against India in the World Cup semi-final on Thursday . The left-arm fast bowler will not be put off after Shane Watson was fined for verbal exchanges in the last eight . Clarke and Co will not be put off in their quest to retain the trophy, though, by the consequences of Shane Watson's epic confrontation with Pakistan fast bowler Wahab Riaz in their last-eight success in Adelaide four days ago. Watson had to withstand some ferocious short balls and gave as good as he got too in verbal exchanges which resulted in fines for both players under the International Cricket Council's code of conduct. The Australia all-rounder emerged the emphatic victor, however - with an unbeaten 64, having been dropped on four off Wahab, as he and the big-hitting Glenn Maxwell took their team to a six-wicket verdict with almost 16 overs to spare. Australia's combative opener David Warner has since suggested he may have to leave the chat to others but Mitchell Johnson and James Faulkner will happily take over. Johnson told Fox Sports: 'I heard Davey say he wasn't going to get involved in all that stuff. Someone's got to do it, and I think I might put my hand up.' Johnson, fellow seamer Faulkner and coach Darren Lehmann all appear most definitely ready to 're-engage'. Shane Watson and Wahab Riaz were both fined for their exchanges in the quarter-final on Friday . Australia all-rounder James Faulkner is another who will not be backing away from the verbal battle . Australia's left-arm pace spearhead added: 'It's part of the game - and what happened the other day with Shane (Watson) and Wahab (Riaz) I thought was exceptional, the way they played the game. 'It was unfortunate with what happened afterwards. I thought it was great entertaining cricket to watch, and I think you're going to see some more entertainment this game.' Lehmann agreed in his column for cricket.com.au: 'I can't help but think it's a bit disappointing that the exchange was deemed to have crossed the line. 'I've been interested to read that greats of the game such as Brian Lara and Kevin Pietersen were surprised that's how it was interpreted. 'But I have no doubt the passion and the thrills that Wahab's spell ignited among the crowd in Adelaide will be there for all to see and hear at the SCG when we take on India in Thursday's semi-final.' Faulkner is like-minded: 'There's going to be words said, and it's going to be a really tough contest. 'I think there always is (sledging) in the game - if there isn't, you've got problems. 'It's the nature of the game, it's a semi-final - cut throat. Australia coach Darren Lehmann said he was disappointed Watson's exchange with Riaz was deemed to have over-stepped the mark . Johnson and his team-mates trained at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday . 'Neither team will be backing down.' India have defied the expectations of many, not just by progressing so far after playing the stooges in the preceding tri-series against Australia and England but by taking all 70 wickets available to them en route - often with pace, rather than spin. Number three batsman Virat Kohli is relishing the chance to prove another point after India's 109-run quarter-final trouncing of Bangladesh. 'It's the perfect time for us, an opportunity to do justice to the way we play,' he told cricket.com.au. 'We knew we had things to work on (after the tri-series), and not much time. 'The way our bowlers have reacted, and performed, with composure, confidence and aggression has been wonderful to watch. 'Our bowling attack has come into play in this World Cup - taking 70 wickets in seven games, that's probably been the difference.

Lukaku, pictured walking down the Loftus Road tunnel, will miss Belgium's upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers . '@steven-defour35 & @RomeluLukaku9 are out for #belcyp & #isrbel,' said a message posted on Twitter by both the Belgian FA and coach Marc Wilmots. Lukaku has played 44 matches for club and country this season, scoring 18 times in 42 appearances for Everton. Reports have linked Wolfsburg, who Everton beat twice in the Europa League group stage, with a move for the striker but manager Roberto Martinez insists the Belgian international will not be leaving for the Bundesliga's second-placed side or any others. 'It has been impressive to see him grow in the last 10, 12 months and obviously we would love to see him grow with us in the long run. That would be the objective,' the Spaniard told the Liverpool Echo. Lukaku controls the ball under pressure from Nedum Onuoha and Steven Caulker at Loftus Road . Former Chelsea striker Lukaku has 18 goals in 42 games this season since joining from Chelsea last summer . 'The time he has been having with the team has been very impressive and we are going to see him develop into a special footballer. 'Romelu has been incredible and we made a big investment in him. 'He is only 21 and his goalscoring record is incredible, but I always highlight his attitude, day-to-day, and wanting to be the best. 'You are looking at a player now that can play Thursday and Sunday, he can take responsibility, he can take footballing concepts on.'","Romelu Lukaku was substituted in Everton's win against QPR on Sunday .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez hailed the Toffees' 2-1 win against QPR as the 'most satisfying' victory of his tenure at the club. Aaron Lennon's 77th-minute winner moves Everton nine points clear of the relegation zone after Rangers' Eduardo Vargas had earlier cancelled out Seamus Coleman's first-half strike.

Lennon is mobbed by his Everton team-mates having scored his first goal for the club with the winning strike . 'It's probably the most satisfying win I've had since I arrived at Everton,' Martinez said. 'The amount of emotion we shared on Thursday and we got back very late - we've found it very difficult this season after Europe. 'We are adapting towards being a team that can cope with being in Europe. 'Coping with the goal threat that QPR are going to throw at you takes a lot of character and guts. It wasn't a day for a technical performance on the ball, it was about being a strong group and showing we have a strong will. 'It was a very important three points today so the satisfaction was immense.' Lennon's decisive strike 13 minutes from time was his first goal for Everton since joining the club on loan from Tottenham in January. Martinez was reluctant to discuss the possibility of making Lennon's stay permanent but admits he has been delighted with the winger's contribution. 'It's too early to say at the moment (whether we will sign him permanently),' Martinez said. Seamus Coleman's rocket of a strike flies into the top corner as Everton went 1-0 up after 18 minutes .

'His performance against Newcastle was his best performance since he arrived. 'He came to Kiev, he shared the emotions we all had and that showed today. 'He had a real will. He wanted to show he had fresh legs and I thought that was his best performance by far for Everton, not just in scoring the goal but in the manner he worked for the team. 'He looks like someone who has been with the group for a long, long time.' The defeat is QPR's fifth in a row since Chris Ramsey was confirmed as manager and means Rangers remain on 22 points, four points adrift of safety ahead of crunch visits to fellow strugglers West Brom and Aston Villa. After those two games, Rangers face Chelsea, West Ham, Liverpool and Manchester City before finishing the season at home to Newcastle and away to Leicester. 'I don't think we need a miracle but we do need a miraculous run of form to get us out of this,' Ramsey said.

"When Sir Alex Ferguson described Dave Mackay as ‘the bravest man in the world’ it was enough to make the eyes water. Not just with tears but also from the wincing recollections which that sentence invoked among the wonderful old footballers gathered in Edinburgh to pay their last respects to a legend of the British game when it was at its most heroic. Ferguson’s was among the more thunderous of the personal reminiscences at Mackay’s funeral. Sir Alex Ferguson gave a moving tribute to ex-Tottenham enforcer Dave Mackay at his funeral on Tuesday . Ferguson arrived at Hearts' Tynecastle earlier in the afternoon prior to leading the tributes . Ferguson was in distinguished company, with former Manchester United man Denis Law (back) also present . Supporters lined the streets of Edinburgh to give the former midfielder the send-off he deserved . Pat Jennings (middle) was Tottenham Hotspur's representative at the Mansfield Traquair Centre . The hearse carrying Mackay's coffin was complete with flowers and a football to mark his passing . The cortege leaves Hearts' stadium as the city were given the opportunity to pay their final respects . The order of service for Mackay's funeral . Ferguson’s was among the more thunderous of the personal reminiscences at Mackay’s funeral. 'I was playing for Queen’s Park reserves at Tynecastle and the great Mackay was playing for Hearts reserves because he was coming back from a broken toe,' said Fergie, himself hardly a wilting flower of Scotland in the physical challenges. 'He tackled me and I thought ""Christ"". But in those days you had to get up. So I got up and had a look at that big barrel chest of his. He just said ""are you alright, son?"" 'The only time I played against Dave Mackay. I’ll never forget it.’ No-one at Heart of Midlothian, who Mackay captained to all three major domestic honours, will ever forget him either. Hundreds of Hearts loyalists lined the route of his final journey from the old ground, in company with the players and staff who have just restored the club to the Scottish Premier League. At Mansfield Traquiar, the former Catholic Church converted into an ornate, stained glass venue for grand occasions like this, Sir Alex described Mackay as not only brave but ‘humble'.

Click here to read Jeff Powell's tribute to Dave Mackay: Enshrined in Tottenham folklore as 'the heartbeat', his iron man demeanour obscured a cultured player adored by the fans he entertained. He added: ‘Humility is embraced by great people and Dave Mackay did that thoroughly.’ This was not an entirely Scottish homage. Mackay won not only his homeland’s Footballer of the Year Award but also its English equivalent. The latter recognised his captaining of a quite wondrous Spurs team to the first post-war League and Cup double. The bravest man in the world? Unquestionably one of the bravest in the world of football. He came back from breaking the same leg twice – both horrific fractures – to inspire FA Cup ‘glory, glory’ for Tottenham Hotspur. The humblest? Perhaps his modesty worked against him attracting the attention of those who selected the Scotland team back in the hey-day. ‘Only 22 caps for a player as good as that?’ Ferguson lamented. ‘Scotland was picked by a committee with its head in the sand.’ A Mackay scarf displayed in the back of a car in respect of the former Scotland international . Denis Law, Frank McLintock, Ian St John, Bertie Auld and John Robertson were among other Scottish icons nodding in accord. From way south of the border came these Spurs celebrants of 80 years lived with uncompromising gallantry on the pitch and uncommon courtesy off it – Pat Jennings, Cliff Jones, Terry Medwin, Alan Mullery, Alan Gilzean, Steve Perryman, Mike England, Clive Allen. Pick a team from those two glittering histories. But when so doing reflect on something else spoken by Ferguson: ‘They talk about his great courage but he was a fantastic, skilful footballer whose intensity and desire to win would make any team.’ And keep a place for Dave Mackay.","Dave Mackay's funeral was held in Edinburgh on Tuesday .

"Stuart McCall insisted Rangers had earned a vital psychological boost in the battle to follow Hearts into the Premiership after recording a breakthrough 2-0 win over Hibs. The Ibrox outfit had lost all three previous Championship meetings with Alan Stubbs’ men by a crushing 9-1 aggregate scoreline, but turned the tables at Easter Road in a result which also meant the Tynecastle club were officially promoted as second-tier champions. Goals from Lee Wallace and Kenny Miller — the latter strongly disputed by Hibs — gave McCall a first win in charge and hoisted the Rangers to within three points of their second-placed hosts with a game in hand. Stuart McCall celebrates watching his side beat Hibernian 2-0 at Easter Road on Sunday . There is a fair chance the two sides could meet again in the play-offs and McCall admitted it was essential his side stopped the rot against their Leith rivals. ‘First and foremost I would like to congratulate Hearts on an outstanding season and winning the title,’ said the Ibrox boss, who drew his first two matches in charge. ‘Robbie Neilson and his team have been outstanding all season, so fair play to them. ‘I am delighted with our performance and the result but it’s only one game, we won’t get carried away. But it will restore a bit of confidence that has been severely lacking. ‘It’s a stepping stone. But if we are to hopefully get back into the top league at the end of the season then we’re likely going to have to play Hibs in a decider. ‘If we had come here and got beat today then psychologically it wouldn’t have been good, so this will help. But we have a long way to go. ‘We want to go into the play-offs with momentum, with a bit of spirit and confidence and players playing at the level they can play.’ Rangers had drawn their five previous games and travelled to Easter Road on the back of just one win in nine. Lee Wallace (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after giving Rangers the lead away to Hibernian . Wallace slams home the opener just before half-time to put the away side in control at Easter Road . That dire run had left Ibrox fans despairing about their promotion hopes but McCall, who earned joy from switching to a 3-5-2 shape, feels his team have now shown they are good enough to go up. ‘Yes, that’s all we want from them,’ he said. ‘Whatever is past has now gone — even today has now gone. There are players in there who need a bit of belief and confidence. A performance like today can only help. ‘I said to the players, there is only one thing better than winning and that is winning as an underdog, when people don’t expect it of you. There is a long way to go and we won’t be getting carried away but it helps with the confidence, morale and belief.’ Rangers fans chanted McCall’s name as the minutes ticked away at Easter Road but he played down the formation rejig that drew a radically improved display. ‘Listen I am no master tactician or anything like that,’ he said. ‘We played a shape and it worked but that was down to the players who carried out what we wanted them to do. ‘You can talk about formations and tactics, whatever, but the bottom line is if the players show the desire and the willingness and the ability like they did today, then it’s about players and them doing the jobs they are asked to do. To a man, they did that today.’ Kenny Miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for Rangers and close the gap on Hibernian .","Rangers closed the gap on Hibs to just three points in the Championship .

"Emilio Butragueno believes a miss by Gareth Bale was a turning point in the El Clasico defeat to Barcelona and the Real Madrid director does not include the Wales star among the players he believes can revive the club's title hopes. Bale skewed a shot wide after the ball fell to him unmarked in the penalty area from a corner in the 43rd minute. Madrid were in the ascendancy at the time but were punished for not making their dominance pay in the second half, as Luis Suarez struck in the 56th minute to decide the encounter at the Nou Camp and send Barcelona four points clear of Madrid atop La Liga.

Emilio Butragueno (left) believes Bale's miss at the end of the first half was a crucial moment in El Clasico . Bale (right) sent a shot wide after getting the ball from a corner in the 43rd minute with the scores level . Butragueno believes had Bale converted the opportunity, Madrid would have gone on to win the game and replace Barcelona at the summit of the Spanish league. 'In big games like this, everyone has their moments, but we didn't take ours. We missed some clear chances,' Butragueno said. 'We had some very clear chances, particularly Bale's following a corner. We lacked that little bit of luck to get the second. 'If we had scored, I think we'd have given much more. 'We're saddened by the result because in the first half we dominated them, created chances and played really well.' Butragueno, a striker who won La Liga six times at the Santiago Bernabeu during his playing career from 1984-1995, believes Madrid have the calibre of squad to overturn the four-point deficit that separates Madrid and Barcelona after the result. But tellingly, he did not list Bale in the players he believes will be key to any upturn from Carlo Ancelotti's team. 'There are 10 games to go. We must continue getting our injured players back,' Butragueno explained. '(Luka) Modric had a great game, giving us security in midfield, while James (Rodriguez) will soon be back with us.

'(Cristiano) Ronaldo was also very good and, in the first half, Karim Benzema was fantastic. 'There are still many challenges ahead and this team has enormous potential.' Since the turn of the year, Bale has struggled to reach the form that coerced Madrid to pay Tottenham £86million for his signature in 2013. The attacker, who had a goal disallowed because Ronaldo was offside when he headed the ball into Bale's path, appeared to be targeted by Madrid supporters after defeat to their fierce rivals. The Wales international was confronted by two men in his car as he departed the team's Valdebebas training headquarters late Sunday. One smacked his hand on Bale's white Bentley and the other kicked out as he sped away. But fan hostility was not the zenith of Bale's woes.

Bale will now link up with the Wales side for their Euro 2016 qualifier away to Israel and the world's most expensive player would be forgiven for being glad for a break from the pressure currently surrounding Madrid.

"Roberto Martinez was unmoved. Chomping on a piece of gum, arms folded tightly, Everton’s manager looked like a man who was feeling the tension of the day. The scene that was unfolding around him, however, was completely at odds with his demeanour. In one corner of Goodison Park, Ross Barkley was being mobbed by a group of ecstatic team-mates, while the stands were abuzz with exultant supporters. Barkley had just gracefully and gleefully ensured Everton had equalled their biggest win of a bewildering Barclays Premier League campaign, a 3-0 slaying of a wretched Newcastle United team who finished with 10 men, but, for a second, Martinez appeared reluctant to embrace the moment. James McCarthy (right) opened the the scoring for Everton on Sunday at Goodison Park and was congratulated by Aaron Lennon . Romelu Lukaku, having set up McCarthy for the opener, netted Everton's second from the penalty spot after Lennon was brought down . Ross Barkley celebrates after giving gloss to the victory with a stoppage time strike to make it 3-0 to the home side at Goodison Park . Everton (4-3-3): Howard 7; Coleman 7, Jagielka 7.5, Alcaraz 6.5, Baines 7; McCarthy 8 (Besic 86), Gibson 8, Osman 8.5; Lennon 7.5 (Atsu 83mins), Lukaku 8 (Barkley 74, 7), Kone 7.

Tim Krul was at fault for the opener, click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone. Soon, though, the magnitude of the result dawned and Martinez was smiling. This was a big victory. The spectre of a relegation battle has been tormenting Everton during what has been a wretched 2015 but here was a scoreline and a performance to ease tensions. James McCarthy set the ball rolling, the excellent Romelu Lukaku secured the win from the penalty spot and Barkley provided the gloss when waltzing on to Christian Atsu’s pass in injury time. True, Newcastle’s resistance was meek but here was a significant step in the right direction. ‘We performed with real desire,’ said Martinez. ‘I thought we were very much in control, and most important of all we played well and wanted to win. In the past we have had a fearful approach in not wanting to lose but we showed what we can do. We dealt with the extra pressure.’ Big efforts on a Thursday night have tended to zap Everton on a Sunday and a return of eight points from a possible 24 immediately after Europa League games has shown what kind of impact progress in that competition has had domestically. Significantly, Martinez was able to shuffle his pack and inject some freshness with five changes to the team that had beaten Dynamo Kiev; it worked perfectly. The return of Darron Gibson, Leon Osman and Aaron Lennon, especially, made Everton a much more vibrant proposition. Sammy Ameobi breaks away from McCarthy down the wing with the two sides goalless at Goodison Park during Sunday's first half . Ameobi fights back gallantly as the winger attempted to stop Everton's on-loan winger Lennon in his tracks . McCarthy fires in his shot from the edge of the area as Fabricio Coloccini chases, but the effort found the net and eased Everton nerves . Finding form in the Barclays Premier League has been difficult for the Toffees who showed their relief in the goal celebrations . Roberto Martinez and John Carver share a laugh on the touchline as their two teams do battle on Merseyside . Jonas Gutierrez, who was again a Newcastle substitute, goes in for a challenge on McCarthy in midfield as Newcastle chase the game . A side with more class than Newcastle might have made things more problematic for Everton and it would have been interesting to see what had happened if either Gabriel Obertan or Mike Williamson had turned in the respective chances that came their way in the second minute. Yet that was as good as it got from Newcastle. Acting manager John Carver argued that his side finished strongly but the reality was they were comfortably beaten and had they returned to Tyneside having lost by six, there could not have been any argument. As soon as McCarthy opened the scoring, the outcome was never in doubt, the Republic of Ireland wrong-footing Tim Krul from 20 yards after Lukaku had laid Phil Jagielka’s long-ball into his path. Krul, really, should have done better but Everton were not complaining. It was, incredibly, McCarthy’s first shot on target in the Premier League for 10 months but it could not have come at a better time, as the relief around Goodison was almost tangible. This stadium can be unforgiving when things are going badly but here they were ready to enjoy themselves. Being unable to get a second goal before the interval caused a few murmurs but, with Newcastle’s play becoming more abject by the minute, there was never any sense Everton would get pegged back and they ended the contest in the 56th minute. Referee Martin Atkinson had no hesitation pointing to the spot after Yoan Gouffran got into a tangle and upended Lennon and Lukaku did the rest, rolling his kick into the Gwladys Street, just as he had done against Kiev. The Belgian had taken 20 penalties in training on Wednesday and scored 17. Newcastle’s task was made impossible when Coloccini was dismissed for clattering into Lennon – Carver said he would appeal if he felt Newcastle had a case but when he studies the video, he will realise an appeal would be futile – and that prompted the visiting fans to again barrack Mike Ashley. It was another one of those days for Newcastle but Carver, to his credit, would not throw in the towel. Lukaku steps up to slot home his second penalty of the week after also netting in the Europa League on Thursday night at Goodison Park . Tim Krul dived the wrong way and Lukaku simply had to find the net with his spot-kick, which he duly did to double the lead .

Mike Williamson slides in to deny Arouna Kone as Everton surged forward in search of a third goal against their 10-man opponents .

There weren't tea cups thrown, they were sensible, and examined it well. I can't be down. I have never thrown the towel anywhere, and I won't do it here. I want them to be positive.’ On this evidence, that will prove easier said than done.

"Stuart McCall's nearest and dearest knew what his reaction would be in the event of Rangers calling. Drop everything. Now 10 days into the job and confronted by his third and most difficult match, a barrage of advice from those friends and family has landed. Drop everyone. Two dismal draws against relegation candidates Livingston and Alloa, stretching the winless run to five matches, has damned the playing provision at Ibrox now operating under their third manager of a sorry season that McCall was hired to rescue. He has not been short of suggestions aimed at helping him carry out that brief picked up from Kenny McDowall. ‘I’ve got family and a lot of friends who are Rangers supporters and, if it was up to them, they wouldn’t have a team out there because everyone would be dropped,’ said McCall. ‘If you speak to supporters, they are so frustrated and disappointed. Stuart McCall has encountered a tricky start to his spell as Rangers manager . ‘You speak to one fan who wouldn’t have him in, and another who wouldn’t have him in, and so on. Kenny tried all different permutations up front with our five strikers. It’s the same with the backline and the midfield. ‘People have said it to me: “I wouldn’t have him, him or him in the team”. But that would leave us with about two players and I can’t flood the team with youngsters. My job is to get the best formula — a winning formula. We’ve got time to do it and it’s what I’m striving to do.’ The emergency work on a squad ravaged by a confidence slump is required for many reasons and some can be traced back to the recruitment — on bumper contracts — of several top-flight players who have failed to live up to being Rangers players even at a lower level. But McCall believes that a more recent explanation for the disarray in his inheritance, which includes four unfit Newcastle loan men, is that their direct competitors for promotion — and today’s opponents Hibernian — were able to be clever in January. Rangers, meanwhile, were chaotic. Hibs have won their past seven games in all competitions since deadline day, reached the Scottish Cup semi-final and are now unbeaten in 15 matches — a streak of results that stuttering Rangers have at no stage looked capable of stringing together. McCall joked that if his family and friends had their way that everybody would be dropped . McCall noted: ‘The key thing for them was the January transfer window when they managed to keep their best young player, Scott Allan, while we had to sell Lewis Macleod, who was ours. On top of that, they were able to add five players. ‘I remember saying to Alan Stubbs at the time what a great piece of business it was to bring in Keith Watson from Dundee United because he’s a really solid Premiership player. Fraser Fyvie, Tomas Cerny, Franck Dja Djedje and Martin Boyle have really strengthened their squad. ‘While they were doing that, Rangers brought in five players from Newcastle and only one of them has been able to play a part. Alan had a clean sweep of his playing staff last summer. It took them time to gel but right now they have energy and confidence and they are hungry as well. So this will be a big challenge for us.’ McCall dug into the reserve reaches of the squad to promote the impressive 18-year-old Tom Walsh. A dozen years his elder, Dean Shiels completed a game for only the second time this season. As McCall seeks that winning formula, he has a frustrated and often frustrating figure offering to be an intriguing ingredient today on a return to Easter Road. ‘I spoke to Dean before we picked him for the Alloa game,’ said McCall. ‘I don’ t know why he’s only had four starts this season. Obviously, there are reasons and Dean will be a big part of that. But he did well the other night for a rare 90 minutes. ‘Everyone is in the same boat — when you get an opportunity, you have to grab it. You’ve got to show that you want to be out there, in training and games. New boss McCall takes charge of a Rangers training session . ‘I know there are players here who want to be in my team. It’s OK being willing and wanting to do it. But there’s a big difference between that and actually producing. ‘Next season, Rangers need young, hungry players. Of course, you need to balance it with experience. But I’d like to have energy and vibrance in the team next season.’ Darren McGregor, having met the appearance stipulations on his contract, will be back for another season. He can bid to be as energetic and vibrant as McCall wishes but it is defensive fortitude that the boyhood Hibernian supporter will be determined to bring today to a Rangers team that have lost their past three to the capital club. The 29-year-old has filled in at right-back — rather than his favoured centre-half slot — too often this season but refuses to blame that adjustment for personal form that he admits has fallen below standard. ‘I’ve been disappointed with how I’ve played,’ conceded McGregor. ‘I need to take accountability as a defender. Rangers have limped to unconvincing draws against Livingston and Alloa under McCall . ‘We’ve conceded too many goals. I’ve played the majority of our games, so I need to say that I could have done better in certain aspects. ‘Everyone knows that I’m not a natural right-back. But I’d rather play in that position than be in the stand. ‘To be fair to the previous manager and this manager, their hands have been forced a bit of the time because of injuries. ‘But I can’t keep going over old ground. The nine games coming up are the most important of the season. I’m looking at this period as a sort of mini-league in itself. ‘It will be time for reflection, finger-pointing and talking about where it went wrong in the summer. But we have to be positive and think that, as long as we get up, in years to come that will be forgotten about. ‘I want my first season at Rangers to be capped with promotion. I don’t want it to be a failure, which it currently is. ‘To come back next season as a Premiership player would be special. We all know what the fans expect and the prestige of playing for this club. We’ve fallen short of that this year but, if we can get up, it will put some light on an otherwise dark season.’","Stuart McCall has endured a tricky start to spell as Rangers manager .

Manchester City are without suspended left-back Gael Clichy for the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at Barcelona. Midfielder James Milner, who missed Saturday's defeat at Burnley with a knee problem, is expected to be available again after training and travelling with the team to Spain.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Barcelona have won their three Champions League meetings with Manchester City by an aggregate of 6-2. Manchester City have had a player sent-off in each of their three meetings with Barcelona (Demichelis and Zabaleta last season, Clichy in the first leg this season). In the last seven Champions League knockout encounters with English clubs, Barcelona have prevailed six times, the only exception being the semi-final against Chelsea in 2011/12 when they lost 3-2 on aggregate. Barcelona have made it to the knockout stages of the Champions League for the 11th consecutive campaign. They have always made it at least to the quarter finals in the last seven seasons. Barcelona have won their last five Champions League games, only Real Madrid are currently on a longer run (10 wins). Barcelona have won seven of their last eight home games in the Champions League games (D1). Their last defeat was against Bayern Munich in May 2013 (0-3). That game against Bayern is actually their only loss in their last 30 Champions League outings at the Camp Nou and the last time they conceded more than one goal on home soil in the competition. The only English club to beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou in the Champions League since 1992/93 are Liverpool. It was in February 2007 (2-1). Sergio Aguero (second right) scored the consolation for City in the first leg as they lost the game 2-1 . Joe Hart  saved a penalty from Messi in the final moments of the game to give City hope in the second leg . Barcelona have dominated possession in each of their last 93 Champions League games. The last time they had the ball less than their opponent was in December 2006 against Werder Bremen (43%). 16 of Barcelona’s 17 goals in the Champions League this season have been scored from open play. Manchester City have lost four of their last five Champions League against Spanish opposition (D1). Their only away win came against Villarreal in November 2011 (3-0). Manchester City have only kept one clean sheet in their last 14 Champions League games (2-0 v Roma, December 2014). Manchester City have reached the knockout stages of the Champions League for the second season running. They have never made it past the last 16 though. Messi missed the follow up header from the rebound of Hart's penalty save as the match finished 2-1 .

"Simon Mignolet believes Liverpool are showing the fighting spirit necessary to qualify for the Champions League as they head into Sunday's seismic showdown with Manchester United at Anfield. Brendan Rodgers' in-form Reds survived a first-half fright at Swansea on Monday night before emerging 1-0 winners to cut the gap on fourth-placed United to two points. Mignolet had to produce fine stops to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson in a first half Swansea dominated but Jordan Henderson's fortunate winner gave Liverpool their fifth successive Barclays Premier League victory. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet punches a cross clear during his side's 1-0 win against Swansea . Captain Steven Gerrard congratulates Mignolet after the Reds' fifth successive Premier League victory . 'We showed the character and resilience during the game that you need if you're going to be successful,' Mignolet said. 'This was our sixth successive clean sheet away from home and we have to keep that going until the end of the season. 'You keep those clean sheets as a whole team. Everyone is playing together, doing their job and willing to fight for each other.' Liverpool have not lost in the league since a 3-0 defeat at United on December 14 when the stuttering Mignolet was dropped and replaced by Brad Jones. But Mignolet soon reclaimed his place and both he and Liverpool have gone from strength to strength ever since, the Merseysiders now unbeaten in 13 league games and Rodgers insisting they can catch second-placed Manchester City who are currently four points better off than his men. United's visit on Sunday might go a long way to determining if that ambition is feasible but Mignolet insists Liverpool have to focus solely on themselves and not their rivals for a top-four spot. Liverpool's players celebrate after Jordan Henderson's decisive second half goal at the Liberty Stadium . Mignolet pulls off an acrobatic save to deny Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson a goal . 'This win sets up the next game and that's a big game of course,' Mignolet said. 'But we don't have to make too much of it, there's three points there and we have to try to do our best to get the win at home. 'We just have to look at our own performances, there's no point in looking at the other teams, and keep doing what we've been doing in the last few months. 'We've still got all the big teams to play but the important thing is we don't look too forward ahead of ourselves.' Mignolet does not resemble the goalkeeper who visibly appeared anxious and made regular mistakes during the first half of the season. As well as his precious first-half saves at the Liberty Stadium he was commanding in the air and punched well under pressure, but he puts his impressive record down to those in front of him. 'As a goalkeeper you're depending on the rest of the team to keep those clean sheets,' he said. 'You can't do that on your own and that's what's pleasing. Henderson scores the only goal of the game as the ball cannons off his shin fortuitously . The England midfielder celebrates in front of Liverpool's travelling contingent at the Liberty Stadium . 'Everybody's doing their job, is organised and that makes life easy for a goalkeeper. 'We had to fight at Swansea to get through to 0-0 at half-time but the second half we got the goal and that came with putting a lot more pressure on the ball.' Swansea defender Jordi Amat felt Garry Monk's side paid the price for failing to turn their first-half superiority into a lead. The Spaniard played an unwitting role in Henderson's winner as his attempted clearance clattered off the Liverpool midfielder and flew over Lukasz Fabianski in the Swansea goal. 'It was an unlucky goal for us,' said Amat, who was making his first league start since September after Federico Fernandez had returned home to his native Argentina to attend personal matters. 'I don't know what happened because I was on the floor but I think we deserved a draw. 'We were playing very well in the first half but we couldn't score one or two goals. 'In the second half we suffered a little bit and we have to analyse that to see what happened.'","Simon Mignolet kept a sixth successive away clean sheet on Monday night .

"Cancer-survivor Jonas Gutierrez made an emotional return to St James' Park during Wednesday night's 1-0 defeat to Manchester United. The 31-year-old has twice beaten testicular cancer and only returned to the club after being given the all-clear following chemotherapy in November. He has since been building fitness with the Under-21s and was named on the bench for the first time last weekend. Newcastle winger Jonas Gutierrez (centre) has defied the odds to battle back from testicular cancer . Gutierrez replaced Newcastle defender Ryan Taylor in the second-half to the delight of the home fans . But Gutierrez finally made his first appearance in black and white in 17 months when he emerged midway through the second half as replacement for Ryan Taylor. St James' stood as one to welcome the fan favourite and close friend Fabricio Coloccini immediately handed the captain's armband to his Argentinian comrade. Gutierrez was booked soon after for a chop on Adnan Januzaj, but looked sharp with his every touch cheered by the Toon Army. And Newcastle head coach John Carver praised the substitute's impact, 'Maybe I should have started him!' 'The crowd came alive. He's worked tirelessly and it showed what the fans think of him – the roof nearly came off the stadium.' Newcastle, though, were beaten by Ashley Young's close-range strike in the dying seconds of what had been a feisty encounter.

"Stuart McCall has confirmed Rangers are paying money for all five Newcastle United loanees - despite two of them being highly unlikely to ever appear for the Ibrox club. McCall has inherited a bizarre situation created by the extraordinary mass deal chief executive Derek Llambias brokered on transfer deadline day early last month. Llambias – a former managing director at St James’ Park – has since been ousted as a PLC director and suspended from the football board at Ibrox following the takeover by Dave King and his allies. Sturat McCall has revealed that Rangers are paying some of the wages for the five players signed on loan from Newcastle in the January window even though only one of them is available at the moment . Of the five players loaned from Newcastle, only Haris Vuckic will again be available for Sunday's crunch Championship encounter with Hibernian after recovering from a calf knock. The only further first-team involvement has come from centre-back Remie Streete, who managed 44 minutes against Raith Rovers last month before succumbing to a hamstring injury. Youngster Kevin Mbabu, who has never played a senior game, is involved with Rangers’ Under-20 squad, but McCall revealed midfielder Gael Bigirimana has been ruled out for the season by an unspecified ‘medical condition’. The new Ibrox boss is also highly sceptical about ever having Northern Ireland international Shane Ferguson available, as he recovers from a knee injury on Tyneside. Asked if the quintet were on Rangers wage bill, McCall replied: ‘Yes. The club is paying for them.’ It’s understood the Ibrox outfit only make a contribution to their Newcastle wages, rather than paying the entire salary they earn at Mike Ashley’s club. McCall prepares the Rangers players for Sunday's clash with Hibernian . Even so, the fact so little value has been earned will outrage Rangers fans. ‘Young Biggi (Bigirimana) has a medical condition that our consultant is dealing with,’ said McCall. ‘But he won’t play for us this season. ‘Kevin Mbabu is training and he has played two under-20 games, but his match fitness is not up to what we would like at the moment. But he’s working hard, the kid. ‘Shane Ferguson has had a long-standing serious knee injury, I think he’s been out for four or five months. He had a minor setback a couple of weeks ago, so he won’t be up with us for another couple of weeks. ‘By then he will have been out for five or six months so he’ll likely need another six weeks to get him anywhere near being available. ‘So even though he might come up and train with us, depending on what level we can get him to, he looks a serious doubt to be involved. McCall faces the media on Friday ahead of the crucial clash with second place Hibs . ‘Remie Streete came and played the first game and pulled his hamstring, was out for a couple of weeks then came back and pulled his thigh. And he’s had an ear infection on top of that. ‘He’s two or three weeks again, working with the medical side of it. But again I don’t think Remie has played lots of football over the past two years. So we didn’t have guys coming in who were hitting the ground running, being ready to play.’ McCall said enquiries about Bigirimana’s condition would have to be directed to the medical staff. However, when pressed if it was something the 21-year-old had contracted since moving to Glasgow, he replied: ‘No. It’s a long-standing thing.’ The current state of play begs the question as to whether Rangers can simply send those not available back to Newcastle. ‘I think that’s not for me, that’s for the hierarchy to sort out,’ said McCall. ‘Certainly two of them - Biggi and Shane Ferguson - would be very doubtful, unless Shane recovers very quickly from his long-term knee operation. ‘For Kevin and Remie, it’s just about getting some football in them. If they are ready to go then we will consider them.’","Rangers signed five Newcastle players on loan for the rest of the season .

"Celtic star Mikael Lustig has revealed his season is over. The Swedish international defender hasn’t played since February after injuring an ankle. He hoped to return to play a part for the Champions in their bid to win the Treble. However, he’s been forced to concede he is unlikely to play any more part in Ronny Deila’s attempts to win Celtic the Premiership and Scottish Cup to add to his League Cup success.

It’s the latest frustration for Lustig in a long line of injury setbacks which have included hip, groin and thigh injuries.

But he was left irritated by the offer and turned the opportunity to travel to London down, saying he had no intention of sitting near his racial abusers. Souleymane S was invited to Stamford Bridge after footage emerged of him being pushed off a Metro train . CCTV footage shows Chelsea fans preventingSouleymane from boarding while singing racist chants . The 33-year-old has turned down the offer, deriding the invitation as 'treating him like a child' Five of the Chelsea fans involved in the disgraceful incident have been suspended from attending matches . 'I won't go. They can't buy me with a little piece of paper. I'm not a child,' Souleymane told RTL radio. 'I don't want to sit in that stadium next to those people who pushed me.' Last month, a group of Chelsea fans chanting 'We're racist and that's the way we like it' repeatedly pushed Souleymane back as he tried to board a metro train before the 1-1 Champions League draw against PSG. Jose Mourinho said he was disgusted by the behaviour of the fans, five of whom were suspended from attending matches after being identified through amateur video footage.

I live with racism but it's the first time I've had to go to a doctor to ask for pills to calm myself down.' Following the incident, London and Paris police launched investigations and Chelsea has said the club could issue banning orders for life. 'I want these people to be prosecuted and justice to be done,' Souleymane said. 'Racism must stop.'

"Jonas Gutierrez has not given up hope of winning a new contract at Newcastle United. The 31-year-old made his first appearance for the club in 17 months on Wednesday having twice beaten testicular cancer. Gutierrez enjoyed a spine-tingling welcome from 50,000 fans inside St James’ Park as he came off the bench during the second half of Newcastle’s 1-0 defeat by Manchester United. Newcastle midfielder Jonas Gutierrez returned to action on Wednesday having twice beaten testicular cancer . The Argentine’s contract expires this summer and it is thought he will be released by the club he joined in 2008. Gutierrez, though, will fight for an extension. ‘I am living day by day,’ he said. ‘All I can do is work hard in training and work as hard as I can. I’m going to fight for my place — I always try to do that. ‘I’m recovering, I’m healthy and I’m feeling strong — now I have to wait for my opportunity and fight for that. Gutierrez joined Newcastle in 2008 and his contract expires this summer . ‘I have three months to do my best and we’ll see what happens. This is football, you are going to get opportunities so you have to be ready for that.’ Gutierrez was only given the all-clear following chemotherapy in November and in January he told Sportsmail it would be the biggest moment of his career were he to play again at St James’. And he added: ‘It was unbelievable, the welcome of the fans. It was a long wait so it was emotional. I have to say thanks to the fans for all the support they have sent me. ‘Since I’ve had my cancer and my treatment, I just think day by day. My first step was to be healthy again. After the doctor said I had recovered, I started thinking, “Now I want to train and want to prove how I feel”. ‘At the beginning it was hard because the body has to get used to the training. My body started feeling better and better and that was a big point, to get me where I am. ‘Now I want more. I’m improving every day.’","Jonas Gutierrez received spine-tingling reception on Wednesday .

"David Luiz made his way back down memory lane on Wednesday as he went for a wander in west London with his Paris Saint-German team-mates ahead of facing former club Chelsea. Laurent Blanc's squad are preparing to take on the Blues in a crucial Champions League last-16 second leg at Stamford Bridge later in the evening.

Luiz is playing against his former club after leaving Chelsea for PSG in a £50million deal last summer . The fixture is finely poised after the 1-1 draw at Parc des Princes two weeks ago, with the hosts somewhat unlucky not to have beaten Jose Mourinho's men. PSG trained at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night and will be looking for revenge after letting a 3-1 first-leg advantage slip at the same ground last season. Blanc called for his side to take their chances in the cauldron at the Bridge. The PSG boss said: 'Chelsea have a slight advantage, because they were able to score an away goal. It's up to us to try to do what Chelsea did in Paris. 'One of Chelsea's main threats is the fact they're very good on the counter attack, so I don't think we should go gung ho. 'We have to attack and we need to score a goal, regardless of whether Chelsea get one or not. PSG need to score at Stamford Bridge if they are to advance to the Champions League quarter-finals .

He had great memories there, he helped them to win the Champions League - so I would be very surprised if the Chelsea fans gave him anything other than a fantastic reception. Among the 10 victims of the accident on Monday were renowned yachtswoman Florence Arthaud, Olympic swimmer Camille Muffat and Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine and Blanc said 'the whole of French sport was in mourning' Meanwhile, Brazilian centre back Thiago Silva has backed team-mate Luiz to take no notice of his former team-mates. Silva said: 'He is a winner , yes he has good memories of Chelsea, but his only objective will be to knock them out - and for us to progress.’ Thiago Silva insists Brazilian compatriot and PSG team-mate Luiz is ready to knock Chelsea out .","Chelsea play PSG in Champions League last-16 second leg on Wednesday .

"As the second Republic of Ireland training session of the week wound down on Tuesday, a number of giddy international footballers lined up at the edge of the penalty box for a bit of shooting practice. Robbie Brady, showing no ill-effects from the thigh injury which had threatened his involvement, made a beeline for the head of the queue, while Wes Hoolahan, Jonathan Walters, Shane Long, Anthony Stokes, Stephen Quinn and Kevin Doyle all waited their turn to receive a pass from Steve Guppy and fire a volley at one of the four goalkeepers in the squad. Taking his place at the end of the line was new boy Harry Arter. Arter celebrates his goal against Middlesbrough during Bournemouth's 3-0 victory on Saturday . The 25-year-old has bided his time to reach this juncture in his career, so he could wait another few moments to take on Shay Given between the sticks. Up he stepped and, with his new teammates watching on, the Bournemouth star found the net. It was greeted with roars of delight and the shots kept coming. Arter may have been happy to take his place at the back of the queue but he will put his best foot forward to earn a place in Martin O'Neill's plans for Poland on Sunday. 'I've been picked because the manager was impressed with the way I play and if I come here and I'm not confident, then I won't show the best of my ability,' explained Arter. 'So be yourself, that's what you're picked for. 'It was a little bit nerve-wrecking meeting the lads for the first time but I've settled in really quick and they made me feel welcome. As much as it's daunting the first time, as soon as you find your feet and introduce yourself it's normal really.'

Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill (sixth left) addresses his squad in Malahide on Monday . O'Neill had a brief chat with his latest recruit before the session to see if he knew any of those involved in the squad, but Arter is coming in with no previous relationships built up. He isn't a total outsider, though. The English-born midfielder, whose grandparents hail from Sligo, represented Ireland at Under 17 and U19 level and always pined for the green jersey over the three lions, despite advances from England to join their underage set-up when he was a promising academy player at Charlton Athletic. 'I chose my country then and that was to stay with Ireland. They gave me the opportunity to play at international level at 15 and I was really thankful for that. I learned a lot from that experience and from then on I was always going to stick with Ireland.' On his last appearance for the U19s in 2007, he was sent off against Portugal, and his club career also took a nose dive when he was released by Charlton and dropped out of the Football League to rebuild his confidence with Woking. 'Playing international football was out of the question. In my head, it wasn't even something I spoke about,' Arter, who has a solid sounding board in brother-in-law and former England international Scott Parker, remembered. Then he signed for Bournemouth five years ago and the club have risen to top of the Championship with Arter a key component of their midfield. Bournemouth midfielder Arter (left) holds off the challenge of Middlesbrough's Lee Tomlin on Saturday . 'Realistically, I think this is the best time for me to come. It's the best time I've been ready for the opportunity. As much as it was at the back of my mind a few years ago, it was something I was hoping for in the recent months.' Arter's experience of life in the doldrums has helped shape his current outlook on the game and fighting his way back from obscurity means he is now relishing rather than fearing the next stage in his career. 'There are probably loads of players who go to non-league and end up staying there. 'It's easy, when you're down at that level, to blame other things or point the finger at other people as to why you are there, but there's a reason for it, you have failed at the level you were at and you have to prove yourself again. 'One thing I felt I had to do was work hard, and I am doing that now, working hard to try and achieve my goals. The key to success is working hard.' 'James McCarthy is a top player and he's at the level that I want to eventually get to,' he continued. 'These players have earned the right to play in the Premier League and have the international experience which I haven't had yet. I still have a bit of learning to do.'","Harry Arter has been in superb form for Bournemouth this season .

"Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill has been left sweating over the fitness of winger James McClean ahead of Sunday night's Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland. The 25-year-old Wigan midfielder limped out of training at Gannon Park in Malahide on Tuesday morning with his left ankle heavily strapped, and was immediately taken for a scan. O'Neill later insisted the examination was precautionary, but he was left crossing his fingers over a man who has become a regular in his team.

He's gone for a scan - precautionary, I hope - but he was just feeling it a little bit. We'll see how he is. 'It didn't happen in training. He felt a little bit sore after yesterday. He thought it might go away, but it's just a bit of a pain across the ankle.' O'Neill will be desperate to have McClean fit for the clash with the surprise Group D leaders with fellow wide-man Aiden McGeady having not played for club Everton since January 31 because of a knee problem, from which he has now recovered, but which has left him short of match fitness. Republic of Ireland's Quinn and Kevin Doyle during the training session at Gannon Park . The 63-year-old, who first worked with McClean during their time together at Sunderland, insists he is yet to pick his team for what could prove to be a pivotal game in the campaign, but admits the former Derry City player has become an important player for him. He said: 'They are all key. We haven't picked the side yet, but James has played exceptionally well for us in most of the games since I have been in charge. Obviously I know him quite well - very well, in fact - and yes, he's a good player for us.' Republic of Ireland's Roy Keane gives instructions during the training session at Gannon Park .

"Marouane Fellaini says it is 'nonsense' to suggest that Manchester United are turning into a route-one team by taking advantage of his height and power. Louis van Gaal has benefitted from using the 6ft 4in Belgium midfielder in a more advanced role as a target man behind the main striker, and it proved effective once again when United won 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday to go five points clear of their great rivals in the race for a Champions League place. It has also led to criticism of United's tactics, with even West Ham boss Sam Allardyce labelling Van Gaal's team 'Long Ball United' after Fellaini's physical presence helped snatch a 1-1 draw at Upton Park last month. Marouane Fellaini (challenging Emre Can on Sunday) has slammed Manchester United's critics . Louis van Gaal's tactics have been heavily criticised during his debut Premier League season . But Fellaini said: 'It is nonsense that our game system is based on me. Our system is based on many good players. 'We play a beautiful football. We play forward, scoring, putting on pressure. There are great players around.' Fellaini came under fire for his performances as a defensive midfielder under David Moyes last season after following his old Everton boss to United in a £27.5million deal, but can also play as a box-to-box midfielder. The 27-year-old admits it would be easier to pin down one position but is just grateful to be playing after a difficult start to life at Old Trafford. 'Fellaini is at his best when he plays,' he added. 'It does not matter where. This season we have played many different tactics: 3-5-2, 5-3-2, 4-2-2-2, 4-3-3. Of course, it would be easier to play in one position, but you have to always adjust to the coach. I play, that's the main thing. 'I can play in different positions. Number six, number eight or as a second striker. At eight, I can go back and forth and arrive in the box. Second striker I played at Everton. At United it's different because I play in a triangle in midfield. It's simple: I adjust myself to the system of the coach.' Fellaini admits that strict disciplinarian Van Gaal is exactly the kind of character United needed to knock them into shape after they finished seventh in the Premier League under Moyes last season. Fellaini's performances are vastly improved under Van Gaal (pictured scoring against Tottenham this month) It looked as though Fellaini would be one of the first players out of the exit, but Van Gaal reassured him that he could still have a future at United when he arrived last summer. 'He told me ""prove yourself and we'll see"". Now they are counting on me. There were never any real doubts. I was injured at the beginning of the season and then returned. 'The coach gave me confidence and I proved myself in a few matches. After that, I was injured and I got sick again. For three weeks I was on antibiotics. It took a while, but now I can finally enjoy. 'The coach is very strict, but that's good. We needed such a coach. Last season we had a bad season. We even missed European qualification. We needed a coach who would put some players' feet back on the ground. Fellaini also backed Belgium team-mate Adnan Januzaj (far right) to make an impact at Old Trafford . 'If he says something, you should do it. Otherwise you'll fly out of it. If he has to take you off the pitch when the game hasn't been going on for more than 30 minutes he'll do it. Or during half-time. Fortunately, it hasn't happened to me yet.' Fellaini had some words of encouragement for his Belgian compatriot Adnan Januzaj who has struggled to make an impact under Van Gaal. The 20-year-old's lack of opportunities has also cost him a place in the Belgium squad for the forthcoming games against Cyprus and Israel. 'He has accepted his current situation,' said Fellaini. 'I try to help him. He knows he must play if he wants to come back for Belgium. It is part of growing up. He will now work harder to try to come back to the national team.'","Manchester United have benefitted from Marouane Fellaini's height .

"Oklahoma City set aside some bad news off the court to beat NBA Eastern Conference leader Atlanta 123-115 on Friday, with Russell Westbrook scoring 17 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter and notching yet another triple double to steer the Thunder to an important victory. The Thunder earlier in the day conceded that reigning league MVP Kevin Durant will probably miss the rest of the season with a foot injury, yet the team came out with an impressive performance that lifted Oklahoma City two games clear of New Orleans in the fight for the last playoff-yielding spot in the West. The Pelicans lost ground with a defeat at league-leading Golden State, while other key results saw Memphis boost its Southwest Division lead with victory at Dallas and the Los Angeles Clippers end Washington's winning streak.

"Brazilian midfielder Lucas Leiva is closing in on a Liverpool first-team return after over a month out with a groin injury. The 28-year-old limped out of last month's 0-0 Merseyside derby  draw with Everton after just 16 minutes but is now edging closer to a return to Brendan Rodgers' first team. And Lucas could even feature in Sunday's vital Barclays Premier League with Manchester United, which would be a huge boost to a Liverpool side who have not lost with the tenacious Brazilian in the side since November 4. Lucas Leiva is closing in on a Liverpool first-team return and posted this video from training on Instagram . The Brazilian midfielder is seen running freely after recovering from his groin injury sustained last month . Lucas was also seen passing a ball in a pretty sharp solo work-out at Liverpool's Melwood training base . Lucas is escorted from the pitch in the 16th minute of the Merseyside derby after suffering an injury . Liverpool face Swansea on Monday night with the chance to close the gap on fourth-place United to two points, giving them the chance of leapfrogging Louis van Gaal's side at Anfield on Sunday. Lucas has begun running freely again and taking part in ball-work, albeit on his own while the first-team spend the night in Wales ahead of Monday's game. However, his current state would indicate a return to the first-team group sooner rather than later and then only match fitness and the form of his team-mates stand in the way of a Premier League return.

"Veteran keeper Shay Given is hoping the Republic of Ireland can blow Euro 2016 qualifying Group D wide open by getting the better of surprise leaders Poland on Sunday. Ireland entertain the unbeaten Poles at the Aviva Stadium desperate to bounce back from November's 1-0 defeat in Scotland, their first reverse of the campaign to date. With world champions Germany still favourites to finish top of the pile despite a less than auspicious start, the race for the second automatic qualification spot is well and truly on. Veteran keeper Shay Given hopes the Republic of Ireland can surprise leaders Poland on Sunday . Republic of Ireland goalkeepers David Forde and Shay Given during the training session at Gannon Park . Given said: 'It is huge. It's a big week building up to it now as well. It's one of the biggest games we will play in the whole qualifying campaign. 'Of course, Poland are a great team, but we are at home and we have got to use that advantage and try to get the win. 'It's not must-win yet, but it's must-not-lose, I suppose. We have all been here before in this situation the the qualifying campaign. We know how important it is. Republic of Ireland's Darren Randolf, David Forde, Cyrus Christie and Richard Keogh during  training . 'It is a huge game, of course, and ideally you want to win your home games and take some points on the road as well.' After victories over Georgia and Gibraltar, the Republic returned from Germany with a creditable 1-1 draw, only to succumb to Shaun Maloney's strike at Celtic Park in their final qualifier of 2014. Their next two games in the group see them entertain the Poles and the Scots in Dublin and only a healthy return will see them maintain pace with the pace-setters. Republic of Ireland's Stephen Quinn and Kevin Doyle during the training session at Gannon Park . Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill during the training session at Gannon Park . Martin O'Neill's men are locked together with the Germans and the Scots on seven points, three behind Poland. Striker Daryl Murphy is refusing to look any further ahead than Sunday's showdown at the Aviva. He said: 'I think there's still a lot to play for. This game now coming, we need to get a result. Especially at home, we want to put in a good performance and come out with something after the game. 'I wouldn't look too far beyond that, just look to the game on Sunday and see what we can do.' Republic of Ireland's Roy Keane gives instructions during the training session at Gannon Park . O'Neill and his players met up at their Portmarnock base on Sunday evening and got to work at nearby Gannon Park in Malahide on Monday morning. Skipper Robbie Keane was due to arrive later from the Los Angeles Galaxy, as were Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter, in the squad for the first time, and Stoke striker Jon Walters, who played 12 minutes as a substitute in Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by Crystal Palace wearing a protective mask over his fractured cheekbone. Everton duo James McCarthy and Darron Gibson and Burnley defender Stephen Ward were among those who sat out training but O'Neill was not unduly concerned. Republic of Ireland's Stephen Quinn and James McClean on the ball during  training at Gannon Park . He said: 'It's not surprising really for James as Everton have played four games in the last 10 or 11 days, Seamus Coleman too. Darron Gibson has a bit of a groin problem - he played yesterday. 'Stephen has just had a little bit of difficulty. He's had an injury which he is coming back from and he's getting looked at this evening, with the club's permission, and we might have to do something about that. He's hoping maybe two or three days on that he's okay. 'Jon is coming in and he's pretty upbeat. He's got a mask and played for the last few minutes in the Stoke game and did well to put himself forward for the game, and there is this week. I think he is feeling fine and will be in later today.' Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane shares a joke as the players train in Malahide, Ireland . O'Neill will not be rushed in selecting his team for a huge game, and 38-year-old Given is determined to use this week to edge himself ahead of regular number one David Forde to claim his 128th senior international cap. He said: 'The goalkeepers in general, David and [Keiren] Westwood and [Darren] Randolph as well, we are all a tight team together and whoever he picks, we will support them. 'You do wish them well but at the same time, your personal pride and professionalism, you want to play in the game and because it's such a huge game as well, I would love to play on Sunday. 'But I don't pick the team, I have just got to work hard in training. I have been playing well at Aston Villa when given the chance, and hopefully I might get the nod on Sunday. But if not, I'll support whoever he picks.'","Republic of Ireland face unbeaten Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday .

"Louis van Gaal claims the world is 'twisted' after a video emerged of Wayne Rooney being knocked out by former team-mate Phil Bardsley. The Manchester United striker humourlessly celebrated in punch-drunk fashion after scoring during the win against Tottenham on Sunday to combat the story which appeared in The Sun. But his manager was less than impressed that the video was leaked. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney re-enacted a video of him boxing a former team-mate . Louis van Gaal claims the world is 'twisted' after the story appeared in the Sun on Sunday . Rooney punched the air, before falling backwards in a similar fashion to what can be seen in the video . Rooney manages to keep a straight face as he falls directly backwards onto the Old Trafford turf . 'I think it is a ridiculous world where we live that I have to answer questions (like that),' the Dutchman said. 'What is this world, twisted? I don't want to answer questions about such things.' Rooney enjoyed his goal celebration but was keen to play down the story and bemoaned the fact it had reached the public domain. Bardsley's wife Tanya had also tweeted that the video was a joke between the pair. The England captain stretches his hands out behind him to break his fall as he hits the ground . Rooney was joined by laughing team-mates as he fell on the ground during his celebration . For a few seconds, Rooney lay on the Old Trafford pitch with his arms spread wide while being congratulated . 'That's the world we live in today. It's in my own home, it's not public, it's what friends do - they mess around in the house,' the United captain told Sky Sports. 'It was a couple of mates in a private house, and somehow it's managed to get on the front page of a national newspaper.' Rooney took advantage of a misplaced pass by Nabil Bentaleb and bundled his way past two Spurs players before scoring the third and final goal of a hugely successful afternoon for United. Rooney, 29, insisted the publication of the story did not distract him in the build-up to the game. He said: 'I've just been focused on the game, it's more interesting for other people rather than for me. You've seen today, I've done a professional job and helped my team win 3-0.' Midfielder Michael Carrick revealed after the match that he and his team-mates had poked fun at Rooney over the episode. 'He got a little bit of stick,' Carrick said.

"Chelsea football fans have allegedly been caught chanting the N-word and anti-Semitic slurs in a new race hate storm - prompting three Asian women and a black man to leave a train. After the club’s victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, a man was heard to say on the London to Manchester service: ‘Paris, Paris, Paris, that’s the way we like it, a n***** on the door’. This was a reference to the shocking incident that saw a group of Chelsea fans prevent a black man from getting onto a train on the Paris Metro last month before a Champions League game. The five culprits were overheard making references to another Chlesea racism scandal in Paris in February . Filming the incident, one passenger captures the Chelsea supporters making anti-Semitic remarks . A video of the latest incident - obtained by The Sun and broadcast by ITV London News on Thursday - was taken by a passenger on the 9.25pm train from London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly. The clip - in which only the seats can be seen - also features someone saying ‘Tottenham are a load of Y**s’, referring to the club’s Jewish fan base, and ‘John Terry is a racist, a racist, a racist’. Club captain Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association in October 2012 for racially abusing then QPR player Anton Ferdinand . The passenger who shot the latest footage - with whom police have been in contact - described his journey as '90 minutes of hell', saying nobody dared to confront the supporters. The video ends when as a man is heard warning his friend ‘somebody might be filming us’. British Transport Police said officers had received complaints from passengers on the train. The supporters also made references to club captain John Terry (centre) Deigo Costa and Terry pose with the Capital One Cup trophy on the Wembley pitch after the 2-0 victory . Detective Sergeant Michael Maher said: ‘I want to hear from anyone who was on the train, particularly in coach E, around the time it reached Stoke, 10.40pm. ‘By the accounts we have received, the group were chanting insults at other passengers, and some of these insults may have been racist. We are in the process of checking CCTV. ‘But I would like to hear from any passengers who may have captured the behaviour of the group on mobile phones. Such footage could be crucial to our investigation.’ The video was taken by a passenger on the 9.25pm train from London to Manchester (file picture) The fans were travelling north towards Manchester from London Euston station (file picture) Four men were ejected by police who boarded the train, with their names and addresses taken, while another four left by choice. And Rory Jennings, from the Chelsea Fans Channel, told ITV London: 'It's northern Chelsea fans. There's obviously some, but they should be quite easily pinpointed. 'The club have done wonderful work with regard to stamping out racism - but it just shows you that there's further to go. These people need to be identified, banned and arrested. It's shocking.' Chelsea are helping police with their probe - 'and their efforts to identify the individuals' A Chelsea spokesman said: ‘We are assisting the British Transport Police with their enquiries, and their efforts to identify the individuals involved.’ Police are also investigating racist chanting at London St Pancras station after Chelsea’s match at Paris St-Germain on February 17. They have identified all those believe to have been involved - the day after the Paris Metro incident – and they will be interviewed. It is the second investigation into allegedly racist chanting involving Chelsea fans attending the same game last month. Chelsea won 2-0 in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium in north-west London on Sunday, with the goals scored by Terry and Diego Costa. Anyone with information about last Sunday's incident on the train from Euston should contact BTP on 0800 405040, or by text, to 61016, quoting B5/PSUB of March 5, 2015.","Five Chelsea fans were allegedly filmed making racist remarks on a train .

"A Premier League footballer with a history of losing consciousness collapsed just seven minutes into a match last night. Bafetimbi Gomis went to ground during Swansea City's game at Tottenham Hotspur in north London as the players made their way to restart after a goal. The 29-year-old France striker was attended to for four minutes and left the field on a stretcher - by which point he was conscious and wearing an oxygen mask. Scroll down for video . Collapsed: Footballer Bafetimbi Gomis went to ground during Swansea City's game at Tottenham Hotspur . Help: The striker, a summer signing from Lyon, was attended to for four minutes and left the field a stretcher . On the ground: Gomis has a history of losing consciousness, fainting three times since joining Lyon in 2004 . But Gomis told supporters after the game on Twitter: ‘I wanted to reassure you concerning my health - it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now.' He added: ‘I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health that requires me to go back and forth to France. 'I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.’ Gomis, a summer signing from Lyon, collapsed after Nacer Chadli gave Spurs an early lead. A Swansea spokesman said last night that Gomis was in a 'stable condition' following the incident. He added: 'He is fine. He is in the medical room. It is something we have been aware of - it is something called a vasovagal condition. 'We have always been aware of it and it has happened before. He has had all the medical and cardiology tests with us.' Shock: Nabil Bentaleb (right) and his Spurs team mates look on as Gomis is treated by medical staff last night .

Stretcher: Tottenham striker Harry Kane (left) applauds as Gomis is taken off the pitch at White Hart Lane . Worry: Tottenham and Swansea players join referee Michael Oliver in the centre of the pitch as they look on . The striker - who earns £50,000 a week - has a history of losing consciousness, fainting three times since joining Lyon in 2004, with the latest episode occurring while training with France in 2009. At the time, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas admitted he was ‘worried’ about the striker. ‘We can't not be worried, it scares you each time,’ he told ITele. ‘A vasovagal episode (fainting) is part of the things that can happen to people who have this type of constitution. It's now three times that it's happened. Yes, I'm worried.’ Last night, BBC Match of the Day host and former England footballer Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Very worrying images at White Hart Lane where Bafetimbi Gomis has been stretchered off after collapsing to the ground with no one near him. 'Play has now restarted at WHL, which hopefully suggests the situation is not too distressful. Gomis has a condition with a history of fainting. Hopefully it's nothing more serious than that.

Recent move to Wales: Gomis playing for Swansea in August (left) and for his former club Lyon in 2012 (right) Taking to Twitter: Gomis reassured concerned fans last night that the incident looked 'much more scary than physically dangerous and I am feeling well now' Previous incident: White Hart Lane was the ground where the then Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest in an FA Cup quarter-final match in 2012 (pictured) Meanwhile, Swansea-born former footballer John Hartson said: 'Hope Bafetimbi Gomis is okay and recovering in hospital after collapsing in the game tonight at White Hart Lane. Thinking of him.' And BBC Sport commentator Conor McNamara added: 'Gomis underwent a series of medical tests for fainting episodes in 2009 which indicated no serious threat to his health.' The match finished 3-2 to Tottenham, with Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend scoring the other two goals for Spurs - while Ki Sung-yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson replied for the Swans. White Hart Lane was the ground where the then Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest in an FA Cup quarter-final match three years ago on March 17, 2012. Muamba received lengthy attention on the pitch and it later emerged that his heart had stopped for 78 minutes. Although he recovered and left hospital a month later, he retired from playing.","Bafetimbi Gomis, 29, went to ground during Tottenham v Swansea game .

"New parents: Adam Johnson, 27, and Stacey Flounders, 25, have a two-month-old baby, Ayla . The family of a millionaire England footballer say he is 100 per cent innocent and his girlfriend will stand by him after he was arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl. Adam Johnson - who was signed by Sunderland for £10million in 2012 - was held by police at his six-bedroom £1.8million home in County Durham. Officers also seized a blank firing pistol during the raid. The arrest comes just weeks after his long-term girlfriend Stacey Flounders, 25, gave birth to the couple's first child Ayla Sofia, who was born on January 8. It was unclear if Miss Flounders and her daughter were at home at the time of the player's arrest. And speaking from Miss Flounders' family home, her mother told the Daily Mirror that her daughter and Johnson were still 'very close' and 'absolutely still together'. She added: 'He is 100 per cent innocent and we will stand by him. 'He hasn't been found guilty of anything. He is a great lad and has not done anything wrong. This is a horrible situtation.' The £50,000-a-week player had been due to travel with the rest of the Sunderland squad to East Yorkshire to prepare for tonight’s Premier League game against Hull City. But the club announced he was suspended, ‘pending the outcome of a police investigation’. The FA refused to comment on the arrest of the winger who has represented his country 12 times, although he failed to make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil last year. Residence: Neighbours said they assumed the 27-year-old footballer’s £1.5million property in County Durham (above) had been burgled when they saw activity outside the sprawling mansion . Johnson, 27, gained a reputation as a keen party-goer when he played for Manchester City five years ago. At the time, he was renting Cristiano Ronaldo’s former house near Alderley Edge and would often be seen in the village socialising with fellow players and women. ‘He liked the attention of being a well-known footballer and attracting women was not a problem,’ said one local, who did not wish to be named. ‘He would often leave his car in the village after a night out as he liked a drink and would always get a taxi home.’ But three years ago, after returning to his native North East, Johnson began dating Miss Flounders. Friends say Johnson opted to live near a quiet hamlet to get away from the ‘bright lights’ of city life. Footballer: Johnson is currently playing for Sunderland and has made 12 appearances for the England team . Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at his house as he was questioned at a Durham police station. Johnson’s stunning gated property boasts six bedrooms and a sweeping gravel drive and is set in more than two acres of mature woodland. The house is a typical Footballers’ Wives-style property with Italian stone flooring, and a spiral staircase to a mezzanine level. The master bedroom has an en-suite bathroom, dressing room and balconies at the front and rear while the other five bedrooms are all en-suite. Left: Johnson was released on bail last night and will return to Peterlee police station (pictured) at a later date . It is unclear where the alleged assault is said to have taken place and police would not release any further details. Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough’s youth academy as a 12-year-old. After making his Premier League debut for Middlesbrough in 2005 he was sold in February 2010 to Manchester City before being signed three years ago by Sunderland. Last night a Durham Police spokesman said: ‘A 27-year-old man was arrested earlier today on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16. He has been released on police bail pending on-going investigations. ‘A blank firing pistol, which replicates the sound of real gunshots but does not require a licence to own, was also recovered during a search of the property.’ Discussions: Adam Johnson (left) is joined by Frank Lampard (centre) while speaking to the Duchess of Cambridge (right) at the England training facility at St George's Park in Burton upon Trent in October 2012 . Former Middlesbrough star: Adam Johnson has represented England  at senior level 12 times . Adam Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough, where he made his debut in a Uefa Cup game in 2005, aged just 17. Almost six months later, he turned out for the first time in the Premier League, taking part in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal. He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, scoring 12 goals in his three-month stay at the Hertfordshire club. On his return to Middlesbrough, he again showed strong form, then made a £7million move to Manchester City in February 2010. In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the speedy winger made 97 appearances, helping win the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield. In August 2012 he moved back to his native North East, to Sunderland, in a £10million deal, and highlights of his time there have included a hat-trick on January 11 last year in a 4-1 away win over Fulham. He said after taking the match ball as a memento: ‘These days don't come along too often unless you're Messi or Ronaldo, so it was nice for me to get that ball as a souvenir to look back on. ‘This is up there with one of my best days of my career along with playing for England, scoring for England.’ He was awarded the Barclays Player of the Month award that month. The 27-year-old has represented England at under-19 and under-21 level, and at senior level 12 times, the last of them in a friendly victory over Italy in August 2012. He has struggled to reproduce his best form on a sustained basis at Sunderland, but endeared himself to the fans with goals in each of the club's three derby victories at Newcastle in as many seasons, including a late winner at St James' Park on December 21 last year. Derby win: Winger Johnson scored a late winner against Newcastle United at St James' Park last December .

"KFC fight: Richard Burbage promised to take her out for a meal if she joined him at a football match . A car dealer got into a row with his wife when he promised to take her out for a meal if she went to a football match with him - then drove her to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. Richard Burbage, 41, of Whiteley, Hampshire, then tried to fight an expert in martial arts who attempted to break up the argument. The father-of-three was convicted of assault and fined £320 for attacking Julian Raffle. Burbage had been arguing with his wife, Lorraine, in KFC after they had been to a football match on a Sunday afternoon. The row erupted because Burbage told his wife he would take her out for a meal in exchange for coming to the match with him. But when she discovered the meal meant being taken to KFC in Hedge End, Hampshire, the couple began arguing. Dan O’Neill, prosecuting, told magistrates that customers at the eatery became disturbed by the row. He added that customer Mr Raffle then tried to calm the couple down and intervened. Mr O’Neil said there was then a struggle between Mr Raffle and Burbage - and the  car dealer twice tried to punch him. But what he did not realise was that Mr Raffle is an expert in the martial art of jiu-jitsu and when Burbage tried to upper cut Mr Raffle, he used his self-defence training to dodge the blows. When the wife discovered she was going to KFC (above) in Hedge End, Hampshire, the couple began arguing . Burbage was then arrested and charged with common assault. After admitting this at Southampton Magistrates’ Court, he was fined £200. He also had to pay £100 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. A separate allegation of assaulting his wife by beating on November 30 was dismissed after the prosecution offered no evidence. Mark Rigby, defending Burbage, said: ‘He and his wife both describe the relationship as feisty, fiery and passionate. ‘What he did was wrong because he swings for him and he bites off more than he can chew because Mr Raffle is trained in jiu-jitsu. ‘With hindsight they are very embarrassed by what sparked this. She was thinking she would be rewarded with a meal and wasn’t pleased to find out that that meal would be at KFC. ‘I think the salient lesson has been learned by the defendant and his wife.’","Richard Burbage, 41, tried to fight  martial arts expert who intervened .

He told his sister he didn't think he would be selected for the squad so Kate went ahead and locked in her wedding date. But on Tuesday, the 36-year-old cricketer slammed a six off the penultimate ball from the world's greatest fast bowler Dale Steyn, giving his team a four-wicket win over the Proteas at Auckland's Eden Park and taking his team into their first ever final. 'From the beginning I said if you can reach your dream that would be incredible,' Kate told NZ Herald. 'He just looked so incredibly happy.

"A  mechanic carrying out a standard MOT test on a Mercedes smashed it through a garage wall after accidentally stepping on the accelerator. The silver E-Class car had been in the garage for its annual test at Cherry's MOT Centre in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, when the incident happened. The unnamed owner was sitting in the waiting area when he heard an 'almighty bang' and ran out to see his pride and joy lodged in the wall. The Mercedes was in the garage for its annual MOT test when the mechanic accidentally drove it through a wall . The car was halfway through the wall surrounded by bricks and debris from the smash. The MOT tester is thought to have pressed the accelerator not realising the automatic car had been left in drive.

"A couple who met while playing a game online have just celebrated a decade of married life together and are 'living happily ever after'. Claire Nelson, from Wales, met American husband Shane while playing a golf game on Xbox Live and spent the next year talking and playing with the US gamer. As a way to relax the Cardiff mother-of-two would play on her children's games console after they had gone to bed but she never guessed her hobby would change her life. Claire Nelson and husband Shane are celebrating ten years of marriage after meeting on Xbox Live . One night Claire, 40, who played Links 2004 with online friends, was introduced to Shane, 39, who was playing across the pond in Springfield, Missouri. Claire, a medical assistant, says that she immediately knew she wanted to be more than just friends. 'We had a mental connection and knew we wanted to be together right way. She told news-leader.com: 'One evening we were waiting for a fourth player to join our game, then there he was, a player named Tungfu (his real name Shane). He was quiet and only spoke a few times. It turned out that the “friends” I was playing with were Shane’s friends too but this was the first time that we “met"". 'I knew he was American from his accent. (I forgot to mention I lived in Wales UK ). We were all chatting and I stated that “I wish I could find someone to romance me and I romance them.” 'Shane cut in with “Darn girl where do YOU live?” We knew there was a connection and we talked every night and on the weekends for nine months.' Because of the time difference between Wales and Missouri, with Claire being six hours ahead, it would be the early hours of the morning when Shane returned from work and was available to talk but she didn't mind. The pair married in 2005 after Claire flew to Springfield in US to propose to Shane . Shane traveled to Wales to wed Claire in 2006 and had another internet gamer as their best man . Claire said: 'We hit it off - over the next few months I'd fall asleep with my Xbox headset on and wait for Shane to get home from work and join the game. He'd wake me up and we'd talk all night.' They discussed 'everything' including Shane coming to live with her, marriage and babies. Although they shared a strong connection Claire said that it was difficult to have such a long distance relationship where they were more 3,000 miles away from each other. 'We dated online for over a year - it was very hard, we lived an ocean apart.' One year later, the couple decided to meet in person, with Claire, 40, flying to Springfield. On the first night she proposed to Shane, 39, a diesel mechanic, with a diamond ring. She added: 'I knew he would say ""yes"".' The couple, who have a seven-year-old son together named Riley, tied the knot in Wales in 2006, with another internet gamer acting as Shane's best man. They stayed there until the following year when they all boarded a plane to Springfield, where they've lived ever since. Claire has since moved to Springfield where the couple live with their children. They are pictured here with Claire's two children from a previous marriage . Claire, Shane, Riley and Claire's two children from a previous marriage now live in Springfield together. Since her wedding Claire revealed two of her friends have also had successful online relationships with one couple are married and the other couple are due to wed. Claire says that the world of online gaming allows you to meet people that you wouldn't otherwise come across. 'The best part about online gaming is that you get to make friends all over the world. 'We are living happily ever after. It's been my fairy tale come true.' She told news-leader.com: 'It was not an easy journey but it was all worth it. We both believe we have found our soulmate.'

"When the Republic of Ireland team sheet for Martin O’Neill’s first competitive game against Georgia was released an hour or so before kick-off, one name stood out: Stephen Quinn. This was last September and the beginning of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. It was the start of a new, bright, vibrant era under the inspirational Derry man. Hull City’s midfield dynamo felt like a peculiar addition. He had been around the block since his debut against the same opponents in 2013 but never started a match with points at stake. Midfielder Stephen Quinn is in the reckoning to line up against Poland on Sunday . This was O’Neill making his point and giving a player previously overlooked a chance to make his own point, too. Quinn provided energy and forward thinking alongside Glenn Whelan and James McCarthy in a three-man midfield. Being left-footed, he also brought balance to the centre of the park.  He was given the ultimate compliment by the manager when he was rested for the 7-0 stroll at home to Gibraltar in October so he would be ready to help stifle Germany a few days later. When he failed to start any of the four Hull games between the 1-1 draw in Gelsenkirchen and the November date with Scotland, it was no surprise Quinn was left on the bench at Celtic Park before being introduced in the second half. And while his last start in the Premier League came on January 18, circumstances may dictate that he is in the reckoning to line out against Poland on Sunday. Jeff Hendrick has been unable to join up with the squad at all through injury while Darron Gibson returned to Everton on Wednesday because of his groin complaint. Quinn, though, isn’t feeling as if he’s a shoo-in to step back into the starting XI. ‘I don’t think you can ever [think like that], there are lads who have been here a long time and you can never rest on your laurels. You have to come back and show the manager you’re willing and able, and are still working hard for a place,’ he insisted. Quinn made his last start in the Premier League on January 18 . ‘No one is guaranteed a starting spot, the squad is stronger than ever with some great additions and the manager will have some headaches.’ Poland may be the group leaders having set the cat amongst the pigeons by beating Germany, but the Dubliner maintains Ireland must be the ones to set the tempo and impose themselves on the visitors. ‘Every game is a must-win game, you want to win all these games and try to get as good a lead as possible. But it doesn’t work like that with such a tough and strong group,’ said Quinn. ‘It is a big game, we know how big it is, there’s no point in beating around the bush. But we’ll go out and do our best. ‘We’ll leave no stone unturned and do all our tactics, and then we’ll go out and do our job. There’s no point in just talking about it and looking at the videos, we’ve got to get on the ball and bring the game to them,’ the 28-year-old continued. ‘I think everyone is a little bit surprised with Germany, they’ve had a sluggish start and it’s a bit of a hangover from last summer. In European football at the minute, any team can beat anyone but you’ve just got to be the best team on the day and hopefully that will come good for us on Sunday.’ Scotland and Germany are both highly likely to win this weekend against Gibraltar and Georgia respectively, so there is little room for error with Ireland level on seven points with them both. ‘I think we can see that, it doesn’t take a scientist to work that out,’ Quinn added. ‘But maybe it’s the team that just limits the mistakes and capitalise on their home form that will progress.’","Republic of Ireland midfielder Stephen Quinn set to line up against Poland .

"It's the perfect home for those who never want to grow up. The ultimate wooden treehouse has now been unveiled in Turin, Italy, in the style of a 'living forest'. Architect Luciano Pia said he wanted his '25 Shades of Green' project to combine the childhood dreams of owning a treehouse with the modern practicalities of living in a city. Scroll down for video . Magical: Italian architect Luciano Pia has designed the apartment block in the style of a treehouse . 'A living forest': The trees inside the property were picked to have the right mix of foliage and blossom throughout the year . The steel structure, with 63 flats inside, has a rooftop garden and trees growing out of the walls. Mr Pia said he wanted to create an outdoor feel for the building, which has been three years in the making. 'I wanted to give people the chance to escape having to look all the time at Turin's urban sprawl and to create a multi-storey natural alternative', he said. The seasonal progression of the 150 trees planted around the property create a 'microclimate' within the building, steadying extreme temperatures during the winter and summer months. Each species of plants was chosen carefully to make sure there was a rich variety of colour and blossom depending on the time of year, and in total the trees are capable of absorbing close to 200,000 litres of carbon dioxide an hour. Stand out: The striking development has its own 'microclimate' inside, thanks to the trees planted around . The project is also very environmentally friendly, making use of the latest developments in technology with heating and cooling systems that utilise geothermal energy with heat pumps, and rainwater is collected and 'recycled' to water the green. Mr Pia added: 'This natural absorption brings pollution protection only to residents, but in the city is also helping to eliminate harmful gasses caused by cars. Bright: The metal structures are designed to look like trees, which 'grow' from the groundfloor to the roof . 'I also placed the trees so that they can to a certain extent absorb some of the harsh sounds from the bustling streets outside.' 'The plants' full foliage blocks rays of sun during the summer while letting in warm light during the winter. 'The building has 63 flats each benefiting from the terraces and vegetation just beyond their windows and walls.' Outside: Architect Luciano Pia said while the wood filters the light in summer, in winter they allow light to filter into the house . Grand: Natural wood is used throughout the property, creating a rustic feel .","Architect Luciano Pia has unveiled the structure in his hometown of Turin .

"Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen believes he has come of age as Wales prepare for what could be the defining moment of their Euro 2016 campaign. Allen does not grab too many headlines, with the likes of Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey for international company, but there's no denying the effective role he plays in Chris Coleman's side. The 25-year-old's game is to break up attacks and get his team moving forward, and it is a role which has gradually won over Reds fans after what he admits was a tricky start to Anfield life following his £15million transfer from Swansea in 2012. Joe Allen and Gareth Bale train on Wednesday ahead of Wales' crucial qualifier against Israel on Friday . Allen faces the media ahead of Chris Coleman's side clash against the group leaders . 'I look back to my first season at Liverpool and I was disappointed with the way I approached it at times,' Allen said. 'But the last couple of seasons I have certainly learned a lot and improved from that point of view and having those experiences. 'I understand now I have experienced a lot of highs in my career but unfortunately there are times when you will have some lows. 'My dip in form affected my confidence and it was the first time I had experienced that at club level. 'At Swansea it had always been progress really so it was a bit of a setback, but I came through it. As well as holding down a regular place in the Liverpool team in recent months, Allen sees himself as a mainstay of a Wales side which has started the European Championship qualifiers so impressively. Allen is enjoying a run in the Liverpool side and has impressed during the club's resurgence in recent months . Wales remain unbeaten after four games with an eight-point haul, but they face a serious examination of their qualification credentials against an Israel side top of the group with an unblemished 100 per cent record, . 'I have turned 25 now so I don't consider myself a young player any more,' Allen said ahead of Wales' trip to what is expected to be a hostile Sammy Ofer Stadium in Haifa on Saturday night. 'I have got enough experience both at club and international level to feel a big part of the squad. 'The experience I have had in the past will hold me in good stead going forward in international football. 'I am getting towards my peak and I hope to keep improving in the next few years and getting better.' The Wales midfielder admits that he found it difficult during his first season at Liverpool . Wales have not been in such a promising position to end their long wait for a major tournament finals appearance since going close to earning a place at Euro 2004. On that occasion Wales lost a play-off to Russia and Allen, then a 13-year-old schoolboy, admits the disappointment of that near-miss resonates with a lot of the current squad. 'I was at the Russia game as my school used to go to the Millennium Stadium,' Allen said. 'I remember the disappointment of that night coming so close as do a lot of the lads. It is extra motivation for us. 'For youngsters and supporters to have experienced that we want to be the group to get there. 'We feel we are getting back to that level, we have quality and much more strength in depth than we have had in the past.'","Wales travel to Israel for a Euro 2016 qualifier that could define campaign .

"Nick Fairley has signed for the St Louis Rams on a one-year, prove yourself deal. When fit and focused, Fairley is one of the NFL's better defensive linemen, but his career has been plagued with concerns about injuries, attitude and his weight. Worth $5million, but with the incentive to make up to $7.5m according to NFL Insider Ian Rapoport, the defensive tackle joins arguably the most fearsome front four in football. The 27-year-old will likely slot in alongside either Defensive Rookie of the Year Aaron Donald or Michael Brockers to aid the Rams' frightening pass rush. Rams coach Jeff Fisher poses with Nick Fairley during his unveiling in St Louis . With defensive ends Chris Long and Robert Quinn, quarterbacks facing the Rams next season - who include Matthew Stafford - will seldom get a moment's peace. Fairley, the 13th overall pick of the 2011 draft, spent the first four years of his career in Detroit, playing 46 games.which yielded 98 tackles, 13.5 sacks, four forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries. But the Lions declined to take up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract and did not exactly bend over backwards to retain his services. A history of inconsistency, injuries and off-field concerns led the Lions to allow him enter free agency. Coach Jeff Fisher made the announcement at a press conference to unveil new quarterback Nick Foles. Fairley injured his knee in the 22-21 win over the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley last year, which ended his season. Following the departure of fellow defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, the Lions have brought in Haloti Ngata and Tyrunn Walker.","Fairley heads to the NFC West and should play a key part in Jeff Fisher and Gregg Williams' rotating defensive line .

"Aaron Ramsey has added his name to Francis Coquelin's long list of admirers at Arsenal and says that the Gunners' man at the base of midfield helps the rest of the team to 'tick'. Coquelin is enjoying an impressive breakthrough campaign in Arsene Wenger's side, finding a way into the first team after returning from a loan spell at Championship side Charlton Athletic in December. And with many Arsenal fans crediting Coquelin with their team's impressive recent form that has moved them into contention for the Barclays Premier League title, Ramsey has also endorsed the theory that the Frenchman has become a key cog in midfield. Francis Coquelin has been impressive in midfield for Arsenal in their recent run of form in the Premier League . The French midfielder has been an ever-present figure for Arsene Wenger's side in the league in 2015 so far . Aaron Ramsey says Coquelin's defensive presence in midfield gives his team-mates more freedom to play . Arsenal have won their last six games in the Premier League and are now just a point behind second-placed Manchester City, with Coquelin - yet to miss a league game in 2015 - providing his midfield colleagues with more freedom to go forward. 'He's been really good,' Ramsey said. 'He's very aggressive and doesn't give the opposition much time on the ball, and that's why he wins so many tackles. Then he wins the ball and makes us tick over. 'It's been really good to see his development this year, he's had a superb couple of months now so hopefully he can continue that. Coquelin attempts to win an aerial ball ahead of Ramsey during a training session earlier in the season . Coquelin was part of the Arsenal side that almost turned around a 3-1 first-leg deficit against Monaco . 'It is quite comforting knowing that one of the midfielders is behind you in position, thinking more defensively. It is something that he does really well.' Ramsey was left out of the starting XI for Arsenal's Champions League exit to Monaco last week and he feels there is more competition than ever for places in Wenger's in-form side. 'There’s definitely a fight for our places,' he told Arsenal Player. 'Everyone is keeping each other on their toes - it’s good that we have that strength in depth now.'

"The Princess Royal was pictured at Sandown Park Racecourse today looking cool in a pair of sporty sunglasses that she borrowed from her daughter Zara Phillips. The Queen's granddaughter, 33, was given the Adidas shades as part of her Team GB kit when she represented her country in the equestrian at the London 2012 Olympics. The sunglasses were certainly lucky for the mother-of-one who won a silver medal in the team event.

So that's perhaps why Princess Anne chose to wear the sunglasses today in the hope they would be a lucky charm for her at the races in Esher. The 64-year-old grandmother, who is 11th in line to the throne, looked happy and relaxed as she watched the horses compete. But while the sun shone causing her to don Zara's sporty shades, temperatures remained cool so she stayed wrapped up in a beige double breasted coat, polo neck jumper and red scarf. Anne looked happy as she watched the races - perhaps the shades were a lucky charm . And just like her mother the Queen who is rarely keen on a public engagement without wearing hat, the princess wore a brown hat with tartan trim. Anne, wearing pearl stud earrings, was pictured in the parade ring during the Grand Military Gold Cup Day at Sandown Park.

"Rory McIlroy has worn the air of a man intent on peaking at the right time this week. He has played well, racking up five birdies in succession at one point during his second round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the first time he has accomplished that on the PGA Tour, but there has still been a sense of a man playing within himself. Everything is about the build-up to Augusta where the US Masters begins in a little over a fortnight’s time. It is there that McIlroy will attempt to join a select group of the greats of the game by winning the only major that has eluded him. Victory would lift him into the company of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods who all won the Masters, the US Open, The Open and the US PGA at least once in their careers. Rory McIlory has been tuning up for the Masters this week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational . This week's Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill is McIlroy's last competitive action before Augusta . The Masters is the one major that McIlory is yet to get his hands on having won the other three . Despite his uneven form in the last month, McIlroy, 25, has looked and sounded like a man who is exactly where he wants to be in the run-up to the tournament where victory eluded him three years ago when he collapsed on the back nine of his final round. If he gets into the same position this year, it is safe to bet he will not let it slip. It was important to him to play here at Bay Hill, partly to honour Palmer, who has seemed hurt in recent years when McIlroy decided to skip the tournament. But McIlroy also wanted to replicate his routine from 2011 when he had a fortnight off before the Masters. ‘It worked pretty well at Augusta, at least for 63 holes,’ he said.","Rory Mcilroy five shots behind leader Morgan Hoffman at Bay Hill .

"Fernando Alonso will return to Formula One at the Malaysian Grand Prix on Sunday after passing a medical examination by three Cambridge University doctors. The Spaniard, who was injured in a bizarre accident in testing in Barcelona last month, was given the all-clear by the British experts. He will go through final tests at the circuit in Kuala Lumpur later this week, but they are thought to be little more than a formality. Alonso’s McLaren team issued a statement, confirming that: ‘Subject to a successful final FIA medical assessment this Thursday, Fernando Alonso will return to the cockpit of his MP4-30 car. Fernando Alonso will fly to Malaysia for the second race of the season after undergoing tests . Fernando Alonso underwent tests at Cambridge University ahead of a potential comeback in Malaysia . ‘Since his Barcelona testing accident, Fernando has followed a rigorous, specialised training programme, designed and closely monitored by leading sports scientists, to ensure his safe and timely return to racing. ‘At the McLaren Technology Centre last week, Fernando met with his engineers and drove the simulator, to bring him up to date with the latest developments on the MP4-30 chassis and power unit. As part of that process he spent time with senior engineers, discussing the accident and reviewing the comprehensive data and analysis, all of which has been shared with the FIA.

Alonso missed the Australian Grand Prix after a crash in pre-season testing in Barcelona . ‘While there was nothing evident in the extensive car telemetry data, nor anything abnormal in the subsequent reconstructions and laboratory tests, Fernando recalls a sense of “heavy” steering prior to the accident. Consequently, the team has fitted an additional sensor to the car, to increase our data capture. ‘Fernando is very much looking forward to getting back into the car and making a substantial contribution to our collective efforts with Honda, to accelerate the required improvement to our on-track performance.’ Alonso, 33, will therefore make his racing return for McLaren after leaving the team in rancorous circumstances eight years ago.","Fernando Alonso missed first race of the season in Australia on March 15 .

"Flying winger Jesus Navas says he will not adapt his game at Manchester City, insisting he is told by Manuel Pellegrini to stay wide and use his pace. Navas has prominently featured for  champions but hasn't scored in the Premier League this season. That may be because the Spain international doesn't drift in-field as much as team-mates Samir Nasri and David Silva, though he says he has played this way since he was a youngster at Sevilla and he won't change. Jesus Navas says he sees no need to change his style of play at Manchester City . Navas competes for the ball with Joleon Lescott during City's 3-0 win against West Brom on Saturday . Speaking exclusively to Bleacher Report, the 29-year-old said: 'The way I play is the way I have always played. 'That is what got me here, always trying to get on the wing and play fast. That is my game, and that's what I am asked to do and what I try to do in every match, so I don't feel I have had to really adapt my game too much.' Navas also insisted that City aren't giving up on the dream of retaining their title, despite Chelsea leading the Manchester club by six points with a game in hand. He added: 'I think there are many games left. Until it is impossible to come back, we will look to close the gap, but we realise it is going to be difficult, but there is a chance. 'If I could change anything or bring anything, it would be the sun and weather from Seville.' The winger looks dejected as he walks off the Nou Camp pitch  a Champions League defeat .

"Gus Poyet has hit out at the Premier League for the scoring system used in the Fair Play Table in which Sunderland are rock bottom. The Black Cats boss is currently contesting an FA charge of improper conduct after he kicked over a drinks bucket and was sent to the stands during the 1-1 draw at Hull earlier this month. Sunderland's Gus Poyet has hit out at the Premier League for the scoring system used in the Fair Play Table . But Poyet is at a loss to explain why his side are considered the least sporting in the top flight. ‘I don’t know how they get the points - it’s so superficial,’ said Poyet of the table which takes into consideration factors such as positive play, respect towards opponents and behaviour of the coaching team. ‘Until two months ago we hadn’t had a sending off, so how can we be bottom? Poyet and Steve Bruce argue during their two sides' clash on Wednesday evening at the KC Stadium . Bruce (left) had to be held back by the linesman as the row between the pair escalated . ‘Maybe when I wave my arms, that’s minus one. Maybe the club will have to tie my hands behind my back! ‘We got fined once (for surrounding the referee) and we corrected that. ‘I don’t care who’s in charge of the fair play rules, but they’re not fair. It’ s an invention.’ Referencing Newcastle’s Papiss Cisse and Manchester United’s Jonny Evans being banned for spitting, Poyet added: ‘How many points is it for someone spitting at someone? Three million? Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared at St James' Park . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension . ‘Me, I’d use common sense. I’ve not seen anything that makes me think we’re dirty, so why we’re bottom, I don’t know. I’d like someone to explain. ‘But there would be no explanation, just words that don’t make sense. I don’t accept it. I don’t care what they say, it’s not true.’ Meanwhile, Poyet’s side – without a win in five – have another fight at the wrong end of the Premier League table and face relegation rivals Aston Villa this afternoon. Wes Brown  reacts after being shown a straight red card by Referee Roger East against Manchester United . Brown  smiles after being shown a straight red card for a challenge on Radamel Falcao against United . The Uruguayan played alongside new Villa boss Tim Sherwood at Spurs and is wary of their revival. ‘I enjoyed playing with Tim next to me,’ he said. ‘He was always a character and you need characters on the pitch. ‘What you see is what you get, there is no side to him. I know he will add forward play to his team and we need to be ready. They have had a couple of big derby wins so normally you would think they are in higher spirits than us.’ Poyet is looking forward to coming up against former teammate Tim Sherwood at the weekend .","Sunderland sit rock bottom of the Premier League Fair Play Table .

"A second bald eagle egg has hatched in a Pennsylvania nest on live-streaming video that thousands of people have watched. The hatchling Wednesday morning came a day after the first eaglet arrived in a nest in York County's Codorus State Park. A Pennsylvania Game Commission biologist tells the York Daily Record the sibling eagles will compete fiercely for food and could end up harming each other. Caught on camera: A second bald eagle egg has hatched in a Pennsylvania nest on live-streaming video that thousands of people have watched . Tweeting: The hatchling Wednesday morning came a day after the first eaglet arrived in a nest in York County's Codorus State Park . Statistics show only about half of hatched eagles ever leave the nest and siblicide - the killing of one chick by a relative - is common. The eaglets won't be ready to fly on their own until late June or early July. The game commission installed a live-streaming eagle cam focused on the nest in December.

"Fernando Alonso will go to Cambridge University on Sunday for medical tests as part of a three-part process that will determine whether he can return to Formula One in next weekend’s Malaysian Grand Prix. The Spaniard missed the opening race of the season in Melbourne last week after suffering concussion in an unexplained testing accident in Barcelona. Although Alonso has since posted Twitter messages declaring himself fit and ready, the FIA have appointed three Cambridge doctors to test him. If he passes these tests, he will travel to Kuala Lumpur for two further sets of analysis. Fernando Alonso will undergo tests at Cambridge University ahead of a potential comeback in Malaysia . One will be carried out by the FIA’s medical delegate, Jean-Charles Piette, who will require Alonso to do a 45-minute computer test to assess his reaction times. His score will be compared with his previous results on the same test. The local doctor at the Sepang International Circuit will also examine Alonso. Alonso missed the Australian Grand Prix after a crash in pre-season testing in Barcelona . The belts-and-braces approach shows the concern among the Formula One community about how Alonso, 33, came to lose control of his McLaren last month. Technical problems have been ruled out by the team, who cited high winds as a cause. The nagging fear remains that Alonso had an underlying medical complaint that meant he lost consciousness before he veered off track – a possibility that needs to be ruled out before he can compete again.","Fernando Alonso will undergo tests at Cambridge University .
