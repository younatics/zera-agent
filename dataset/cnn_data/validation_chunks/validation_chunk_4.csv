"(CNN)In September 2002, then-former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a U.S. congressional committee ""there is absolutely no question whatsoever"" that Saddam Hussein's Iraq was developing nuclear weapons at ""portable manufacturing sites of mass death."" Once Hussein had nuclear weapons, Netanyahu warned, ""the terror network will have nuclear weapons,"" placing ""the security of the entire world at risk."" Fast forward to this week, and Netanyahu was back, this time as prime minister, to make virtually identical claims about Iran. Yet not only has the U.S. intelligence community disagreed with Netanyahu's assessment of Iranian nuclear intentions, so does Israel's, according to leaked documents. Indeed, more than 200 retired security officers have publicly criticized Netanyahu as a danger to Israel's security. Sadly, Netanyahu's presentation reinforces caricatures regularly advanced by American and Gulf Arab pundits -- caricatures of Iran as aspiring Middle Eastern hegemon, bent on overthrowing an otherwise stable regional order. It's a misguided perspective that is actually hurting the United States. In Netanyahu's view, America should only improve relations with an Iran that stops its regional ""aggression,"" its support for ""terrorism,"" and its ""threat[s] to annihilate ... Israel.""  In other words, America should not improve relations with an Iran whose regional influence is rising. In reality, Iran's rise is not only normal, it is actually essential to a more stable region. As nuclear talks with Tehran enter a decisive phase, rapprochement with a genuinely independent Iran -- not a nominally independent Iran whose strategic orientation is subordinated to U.S. preferences -- is vital to halting the decline of America's strategic position. Washington has long worked to consolidate a highly militarized, pro-American Middle Eastern order. Yet these efforts -- pursued across Democratic and Republican administrations and intensified after 9/11 -- have clearly failed. As a result, the Middle East today is less stable, more riven with sectarian and ethnic conflict, and more violent than at any point in its modern history. And America, in a textbook illustration of ""imperial overstretch,"" has made itself weaker, both regionally and globally. America's quest for Middle Eastern hegemony has failed for many reasons. For a start, seeking dominance impels Washington to replicate, in multiple venues, its Faustian bargain with imperial Iran from 1953 until the last shah's overthrow in 1979, providing substantial and effectively open-ended support to governments acting against the desires of their own publics. While American elites argue that America benefits from such arrangements, they are ultimately unsustainable, as Iran's 1979 revolution demonstrated. A determination to dominate the Middle East keeps locking Washington into these kinds of relationships; for its own sake, the United States needs to stop trying to be the Middle East's hegemon. That means embracing a regional balance of power -- not the chimera of American dominance misleadingly labeled as ""balance,"" but an actual balance in which major regional states, acting in their own interests, constrain one another. Under any political system, Iran would be a significant regional actor, due to its geostrategic location, hydrocarbon resources, and large, educated population.  But the Islamic Republic -- which Iranians built themselves as a participatory Islamist system representing their interests, not those of rulers beholden to foreign powers -- has a legitimacy America must accept to foster a truly stable Middle East. Iran has gained influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen by backing political structures that, in Tehran's judgment, will produce governments committed to foreign policy independence. Washington needs cooperation with just such an Iran against common foes like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and to balance counterproductive policies of America's regional allies. Washington's self-damaging drive for Middle Eastern hegemony is inextricably linked to its unconditional support for an increasingly extreme and unrepresentative Israel. A myth prevails that America's bond with Israel flows from ""shared democratic values"" and response to the Holocaust. In fact, Washington only started providing Israel with significant military assistance and diplomatic impunity after the 1967 War, when Israel seized pivotal territory from Egypt and Syria, two Soviet allies opposed to American regional dominance.  For the remainder of and after the Cold War, U.S. officials calculated that ensuring Israel's military superiority over its neighbors helped America pursue hegemony over the Middle East, even as occupying millions more Palestinians clearly made Israel less democratic. (The U.S. government's own demographic data show that the number of Arabs under Israeli control -- in ""Green Line"" Israel, Gaza, the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and the West Bank -- exceeds that of Israeli Jews, making the Israeli state a minority regime for the people it governs). A state representing all these people would not occupy Arab populations or seek ever greater freedom of military initiative in its neighborhood. Israel's pursuit of these policies -- facilitated by U.S. guarantees of its ""qualitative military edge"" -- conditions Washington's commitment to keeping over 100 million Arabs under U.S.-backed autocracies and puts America on a war footing with an Iran unwilling to join this inherently unstable regional order. The reality is that Israel's concern about Iranian nuclearization is not that Tehran will use (at the moment nonexistent) nuclear weapons against a nuclear-armed Israel. Instead, as then-Defense Minister Ehud Barak explained in 2012, it is that a nuclear Iran would ""restrict our range of operations."" But this is precisely what a truly stable balance of power requires. America needs constructive relations with all major regional states, including Iran, so that they constrain one another's reckless impulses.","Hillary Mann Leverett: Middle East less stable than at any point in modern history .
United States needs constructive ties with all major regional states, including Iran, she says ."
"(CNN)The U.S. Navy doesn't just do stuff ""for fun,"" says the command master chief of the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, but what 30% of the ship's crew will be up to over the next year or so can at least be termed pretty cool. And it will certainly be unprecedented. Some 1,200 of the Reagan's crew will be executing what the Navy calls a three-hull swap, serving aboard three different carriers in one tour of duty as the service juggles assets to meet mission requirements. The 1,200 are calling themselves ""The Three Presidents Crew,"" as they will serve aboard three of the Navy's carriers named after presidents: the Reagan, the USS George Washington and the USS Theodore Roosevelt. The crew will even have its own insignia and hull number, CVN 220, the sum of the hull numbers of the Reagan (CVN 76), the Roosevelt (CVN 71) and the Washington (CVN 73). Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class David Frederick aboard the Reagan came up with the logo. ""I am honored that my art will be a part of the legacy of this 'Three Presidents' crew, and I hope that it will bring attention to the hard work of all the Sailors who are involved in this crew swap,"" he said. The swap will begin this summer. The George Washington will go from its home port in Japan to San Diego, where a crew swap with the Reagan will take place. While the George Washington crew takes the Reagan to replace the Washington in Japan, the Three Presidents crew will board the George Washington, which will be headed for Norfolk, Virginia, and an overhaul. The 1,200 will sail with the Washington around South America, then they will fly back to San Diego to crew the Roosevelt, which is taking the Reagan's current spot there. ""Think of how difficult a three-hull carrier swap would be to carry out,"" Capt. Chris Bolt, the commander of the Reagan, said in the ship's publication, The 76er. ""It's never been done before."" ""We are just moving assets around so we can continue to meet mission requirements. That's exactly what this is all about. It's not because the Navy said, 'Let's do this for fun,' "" Spike Call, command master chief of the Reagan, said in The 76er. Seven of the Navy's 10 active aircraft carriers are named after presidents. As one commenter on the Reagan's Facebook page said, maybe next time, the Navy could add a fourth carrier to the hull swap and come up with ... the USS Mount Rushmore. Hmmm, the Navy does have the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), but there is no carrier for Jefferson. So say we sub in the Reagan and come up with CVN 292. Apologies to the USS Rushmore (LSD 47).","1,200 sailors to go through a three-hull swap, serving aboard three different carriers in one tour of duty .

"(CNN)I am a friendly, hard-working Ohio native. It's how a lot of my friends in New York describe Midwesterners. It's as if we're assembled at ""The Flyover Wonder Bread Factory,"" devoid of color or depth. We supposedly represent all that is wholesome in America. That may be true, but ""friendly and hard-working"" is so ... bland. If you think I'm being a tad harsh, ask anyone who isn't from the Midwest to describe someone born and raised in America's Heartland. My favorite definition came from a colleague raised in Florida. She struggled to describe us at first, then said, ""Simple."" Um, like the Amish? ""No,"" she said, flustered. Even my fellow Midwesterners have a hard time coming up with interesting descriptors. CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos is a proud native of North Muskegon, Michigan. First thing out of his mouth, ""Friendliness!"" After that, he struggled, too. ""Boy, let me see...um...not easily agitated?"" I rolled my eyes. ""That is so bland, Danny."" He paused, then said, ""I'll take bland over the rap Florida gets any day."" Even my new friend, Jared Zak, from Wisconsin struggled. The best he could  come up with was ""hearty."" I asked these questions after interviewing Eric Dayton, who wants his native Minnesota to divorce itself from the Midwest. ""We're Midwest if you're looking at it from New York City or from anywhere on [the East] Coast,"" Dayton told me. ""But then again, that's someone else's definition. I think it's time for us to claim our own."" Dayton and his brother, Andrew, whose father is the state's governor, are Minneapolis businessmen whose clothing store and restaurant have a decidedly local flavor. Eric Dayton, after touring Scandinavia (many Minnesotans are of Norwegian descent), became enthralled by the region's strong identity. It proudly embraced its chilly weather, its food, its culture, its... Northiness. So why, he questioned, didn't Minnesota? When Dayton got home he hired a Minnesota company to make stocking hats for his clothing boutique that said, ""North."" They sold out and Dayton's idea headed, well, north. Minnesotans just got it, he said. I admit, I didn't get it, until I thought more about it. Minnesota -- or should I say Minneapolis --  is criticized, by some of my compatriots, for being ""Minnesota nice,"" the sort of ""nice"" (fake) that isn't remotely the kind of ""nice"" (sincere) for which Midwesterners are renowned. But, hey, I have an open mind. You could argue that Minnesota, along with North Dakota, parts of Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan, are in the Northern region of the United States. And, you could argue Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia are Eastern states. The only truly Midwestern states are Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. Go ahead, argue among yourselves, but know that Mr. Dayton isn't talking only about geography when it comes to labeling Minnesota -- ""The North."" He's talking about image and, although he won't say it, branding. ""The New York Times had done an article highlighting different Thanksgiving side dishes,"" Dayton told me. ""For Minnesota, they named grape salad as our signature side dish. And no one in Minnesota had ever heard of grape salad... it was kind of a harmless example, but if we don't tell the rest of the country who we are, we end up with grape salad."" That story got under my skin, especially when I looked up the NYT idea of Ohio's signature side dish: English pea and onion salad. It gets worse. The Times extolled the salad's ""deliciousness"" by saying it ""calls to mind the processed-food delights that, for decades, characterized the cooking of the Midwest."" Seriously? The New York Times isn't solely to blame for the Midwest's image problem. Politicians are, too. Andrew Cayton is a distinguished professor of history at Miami University in Ohio. He wrote a book called ""The Identity of the American Midwest: Essays on Regional History."" ""The Midwest,"" he told me, ""has always been a dynamic and diverse place, but that image doesn't fit with what people want to believe."" And, by people, Cayton means politicians who routinely use the Midwest as code for a place in time that never actually existed: crime-free and populated with hard-working people who all look and worship the same. ""Arguing about the Midwest,"" Cayton says, ""has become arguing about America as a whole."" So, listen up, campaigning politicians! Stop trying to bond with the Midwest with your bowling prowess (or lack thereof) and for goodness' sake, stop eating corn dogs at state fairs. And while I'm at it, political reporters, please stop interviewing voters in diners! I'm not maligning bowling (my dad, Tony, is in the Amateur Bowling Hall of Fame) or corn dogs, but those things don't represent the modern Midwest. It is so much more dynamic and, yes, diverse. Chicago is not like Detroit. St. Louis is not like Pittsburgh. Indianapolis is not like Columbus, or Dayton or Cleveland or Cincinnati. And, Minneapolis is not like any of them, either. Minnesota boasts 10,000 lakes and a corresponding love of cold-weather sports, such as pond hockey. Yet, I'm from Canton, Ohio, and I have never touched a hockey stick (although those other ""Northern"" states certainly have excellent puck-handling abilities). Minneapolis also has a thriving cultural community, is home to 19 Fortune 500 companies and has a cuisine all its own that is not based on processed foods. And, at the moment -- it has what many polite Midwesterners can't abide by -- attitude. You know, Minnesota nice. Definition? As my pal from Wisconsin puts it, ""sarcastic, pretentious and exclusionary."" ""I know. Arrogant Minnesota,"" Dayton joked. ""That's what everyone thinks of when they think of Minnesota. Right? No, again, this isn't about being better. It's not a relative thing. It's just I think there are a lot of great things happening in Minnesota. It's not being recognized. I think it's important for the reasons we've discussed that there is recognition of what we have to offer. And so it's just putting forth our story. It's not trying to make it look better than it is. It's not comparing ourselves to anyone else."" I don't know if Dayton will be successful, but I do understand why he wants Minnesota to define Minnesota. You don't attract the best and the brightest with ""friendly."" ""There is a competition for talent,"" Dayton said. ""And it's a national competition, even an international competition."" Maybe Ohio should join the rebranding club and become ""The East."" 'Cause you know what? I may be friendly and hard-working, but I'm not simple. So stop asking me if I've ever gone ""cow tipping."" Or I just might go all Minnesota on you.","Costello: The Midwest is not 'flyover country' and has more to offer than friendliness.

"(CNN)The Alabama Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered probate judges in the state to stop issuing licenses for same-sex marriages.

""Same-sex couples in #Alabama should not lose hope because of out-of-step Supreme Court ruling; #marriage fight is far from over. #ALMarriage,"" tweeted Equality Alabama. The Liberty Counsel, which filed an emergency petition to the state's Supreme Court said on its website that ""the ruling of the Alabama Supreme Court offers the most forceful and clearly articulated rebuttal to date of the imaginative arguments for same-sex ""marriage"" employed by federal courts."" In his dissent, Justice Greg Shaw wrote that he didn't think the case was properly filed nor did the court have jurisdiction. He also said the public interest groups involved in the case cannot sue in Alabama's name.

"Brisbane (CNN)Bras hang from the antlers of a pair of moose heads above the bar inside an old music hall. Dim red light shines on classic leather booths. You push through a crowd dancing to a live rockabilly band and head to the toilet, tipsy. Then something weird happens -- you exit the washroom and find yourself in a different bar. The early 1900s dance hall with chandeliers has vanished. Suddenly, you're in a whimsical bar with a pirate serving drinks. No, you haven't had too much to drink and the washroom isn't a passageway through a time-space continuum. You've simply stepped into the maritime-themed Mermaid Bar. Inside Lefty's Old Time Music Hall, the Mermaid Bar is an example of the latest nightlife trend in Brisbane -- hidden bars. Sultry old days . ""We actually didn't mean to turn the Mermaid into a secret bar,"" says Mick Dwyer, general manager of Lefty's. ""We were just lazy and didn't publicize it."" The story behind the hidden bar takes in a bit of sultry local history. Before Lefty's moved in, the building was occupied by the Velvet Cigar, a longtime strip club. Jamie Webb, owner of local restaurant Peasant and Cabiria, took over the place and renovated it, preserving some of the old establishment's bawdy touches. ""We loved the mirror too much to take it down,"" says Webb, referring to the long mirror that still runs the length of one wall. ""It used to be in front of the dance floor for the girls, but we turned the dance floor into booths."" ""If you look at the floor, you can still see some of the holes where dancing poles used to be,"" says Dwyer. A list of prices for services rendered by different girls still hangs inside the toilet. The bar counter upstairs is where customers once paid for extra services from dancers before entering a small room (now the Mermaid Bar, which sells beer in cans). Mermaid Bar: Secret escape . ""There are actually three entrances to the Mermaid Bar,"" says Webb of the hidden bar. ""It's my favorite place. It's a lot of loud fun out there at Lefty's sometimes, and the Mermaid is like my escape."" The small Mermaid is bright, with light shining through the windows. Sharks hang from the ceiling and paintings of mermaids adorn the walls. People love the Mermaid for different reasons. ""Some like the bartender dressed up as a pirate,"" says Dwyer. ""Some say it's the cannon on the pirate ship model behind the bar."" That pirate bartender, Dean Moready, says the apple rum made from fresh-pressed apple juice is the real crowd-pleaser. About those bras on the moose antlers . While the Mermaid is a rum bar, Lefty's is a whiskey bar -- each has about 100 varieties of rum or whiskey, and a food menu. Three bands usually perform each night at Lefty's and the bar always gets busy after 9 p.m. So what's up with the bras on the moose heads? ""I once dared a customer on a hen night to sling a bra to the horn to win a free shot,"" says Webb. ""She did and it has become a tradition ever since."" ""We have a strict bra-only policy.""

An unassuming doorway that looks like the entry to a basement storeroom is marked with just a small sign hinting that something grander might exist behind it. ""It really was a storeroom,"" says a manager at the Walrus. ""We have been hoping to make use of the space, but it wasn't until after the big flood in 2011 that we renovated the place into an underground bar.""

"(CNN)A court in Turkey this week sentenced two cartoonists to 11 months and 20 days in prison for insulting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Soon after, the court changed the jail sentence to a fine of 7,000 Turkish lira or about $2,700 each. Cartoonists Bahadir Baruter and Ozer Aydogan draw for the weekly satirical magazine Penguen.  Founded in 2002 with a weekly average of 65,000 readers, the irreverent comic book -- similar in many ways to the French magazine Charlie Hebdo -- regularly skewers Turkish politicians. A defamation suit was filed against an August cover of Penguen in which a cartoon figure of Erdogan is welcomed to the presidential palace by a public servant. Erdogan tells him, ""But this is so dry. We could have at least slaughtered a journalist."" In a statement to the press, the Penguen team explained that a citizen who described himself as an Erdogan supporter ""sent an email to the Prime Ministry Information Center. ... According to the notice, the employee (in the cartoon) 'made the gay signal with his fingers.' "" Turkey's public prosecutor eventually launched an investigation, claiming that both the speech bubbles and the ""hand drawing"" insulted Erdogan. While the court ruled Wednesday in favor of Erdogan, a full-length explanation of the verdict will be released in a week to 10 days. It is so far unclear whether the judge ruled that the speech bubbles or the ""gay hand gesture"" or both were an insult. The ruling comes amid an increase in criminal cases lodged against journalists, students and public figures for ""defamation against a public officer."" In 2014, Turkey was ranked one of the world's worst jailers of journalists by the media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders and its press status ""not free"" by Freedom House. The Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Nils Muižnieks, expressed his concern about the ruling against Penguen as well as the surge in criminal cases against people accused of insulting Erdogan. ""This sentence is misguided and, along with a pattern of criminal prosecutions, sends a chilling message to media professionals and all those who want to exercise their right to free expression,"" Muižnieks said. Ann Harrison of freedom of press advocacy group PEN International told CNN, ""We have long called for decriminalization of defamation, particularly of state officials, as to criminalize criticism of authorities severely stifles reporting and public debate."" Harrison noted that special mandates from the United Nations, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Organization of American States have called for the abolishment of criminal defamation laws. Penguen announced it will appeal the decision. The magazine also defiantly released a new cartoon mocking the case. ""We will continue drawing our cartoons,"" Penguen announced in a statement.

"(CNN)Gold bars. Each weighed between 25 and 27 pounds, together about 275 pounds. The bars' total weight in gold is worth about $4.8 million. That much adds up. But what about the story of how they got swiped on Sunday from a truck alongside Interstate 95 in North Carolina? Investigators are trying to figure that out, including how two armed security guards could have been so quickly pounced upon, bound and then robbed so soon after pulling over in Wilson County, as they've told authorities. ""There's suspicion about everything going on in this case,"" Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. said Wednesday in a news conference about the case. He also released composite sketches of two of the three suspects, one of whom he described as a heavyset Hispanic male with a Cuban accent and the other as a dark-skinned Hispanic male with a white mustache and goatee who was dressed in black. He showed reporters a photo of the white van they allegedly got away in, as well as an image of the traffic cones they used -- which came from a Florida company that doesn't do business in North Carolina. What he couldn't say definitively was whether these men had some help. There are a lot of questions, in fact, that can't be answered. Authorities say the initial statements from the two guards who work for TransValue Inc., a Florida-based company that transports valuables, were a bit confusing due to the guards' spotty English, though Woodward said police now have a clearer picture after bringing in Spanish-speakers to translate. These two men, both of whom have worked for TransValue for several years, set off early Sunday morning from Miami with a truck full of gold protected by a padlock and presumably their firearms. They were headed for Bridgewater, Massachusetts, ""to a place ... where they handled such things,"" Woodard explained. They stopped to get gas in Dillon, South Carolina, then hit the interstate once again. The guards later told police they smelled gas, with one of them getting sick. So they pulled over. That leads to the first big question about the men's story: Did something happen to their vehicle to cause the gas smell? Not according to a Wilson County mechanic, who ""did not determine any type of issues"" with the truck, according to Woodard. So the sicker guard gets out of the vehicle. He says he's quickly met by two suspects, who yell out, ""Policia, policia."" They ask him to go to the ground then tie him up with three zip ties, according to Woodard. After this, the other guard gets out of the vehicle. He encounters the same men -- one of them wearing a red traffic vest -- who repeat that they are police. He says that he, too, eventually gets to the ground and is bound with duck tape. But weren't these armed guards? Yes and no. Neither man had a gun on them when they exited their vehicle, violating their company's protocol, the sheriff said. And did anyone see them get bound and led into the nearby woods? No, at least no one who has contacted police. But people called authorities around 6:49 p.m. Sunday after they spotted the men, still bound, coming out of the woods, according to Woodard. By then, the $4.8 million in gold and the three men suspected of taking it were gone. That's left authorities trying to track those valuables down and piece together exactly what happened. Investigators have already gone to South Carolina, and they're getting help from the FBI. They're all working to get information out of places between Florida and North Carolina, to try to corroborate the guards' stories and uncover any evidence that might identify the suspected thieves. Woodard says TransValue has been ""very cooperative"" in the investigation, as have the company's two guards. Neither was injured beyond some scratches on their legs from going into the woods. ""Right now, (the guards) are still considered victims,"" Woodard said, declining to answer whether or not authorities believe this was an inside job. ""... But we're investigating every avenue.""","A truck filled with gold bars pulled over alongside Interstate 95 in North Carolina .

"(CNN)A decade ago al Qaeda would meet potential recruits face to face; now ISIS engages in one-to-one dialogue while sat 2,000 miles away. With what it says is a $2 billion budget, the group produces slick videos in which sexy bearded jihadists are paraded as potential husbands and burka-clad jihadi brides carry Kalashnikovs while extolling the virtues of the utopian Caliphate and a ""guaranteed ticket to paradise."" Aqsa Mahmood, 19, left home for university one morning in November 2013 never to return. Instead of going to classes, she travelled to Syria; last February she married a jihadi fighter, and since then she has become a notorious poster girl for ISIS. What is so unusual about Aqsa is that she was given every chance in life: privately educated and offered freedoms that many other Muslim girls would envy. And while most were quick to condemn the Mahmood family for missing the signs of radicalization, 18 months on they remain none the wiser as to what prompted her to run away -- Aqsa's parents had actually warned their children of the need to avoid extremist websites. Following the terror attacks in London on July 7, 2005, the then Prime Minister Tony Blair insisted those responsible were motivated by an ""evil ideology,"" a ""perversion of Islam that promoted absurd grievances,"" and that they had nothing to do with the war in Iraq, but he was wrong: the Iraq ""adventure"" opened the gates of hell, and today young Muslims are being seduced by an updated narrative. For over a decade mosque leaders have been asked to eradicate extremism but they are no more than glorified gatekeepers whose lives bear little relevance to those of most modern day Muslims. The need to tackle radical preachers has crushed political debate and created a dangerous vacuum which is now being filled outside of mosques. Every new atrocity is invariably followed by useless public statements of sorrow from so-called ""Muslim leaders,"" further increasing the anger felt by the younger community -- successfully drawing young Muslims away from the path of violence takes more than routine declarations that ""Islam is a religion of peace."" It is easy enough to dismiss the words of wannabe radical jihadists as little more than the posturing of nihilistic adolescents, but the steady stream of recruits to ISIS cannot be ignored. Several years ago al Qaeda recruitment propaganda included videos of men with long beards ranting in Arabic in front of a black flag, followed by grainy footage of a truck blowing up as it drove towards Americans. It wasn't particularly effective as a recruitment tool, but then they only needed a handful of recruits to change our society for ever. Today ISIS runs a powerful, slick, modern social media machine distributing messages daily across many different platforms. Their propaganda contains the same violent, distorted interpretation of Islam but it is more advanced than anything al Qaeda ever produced, and the authorities cannot police it or compete with it. For many, the greatest shock has been young girls like Aqsa wanting to leave behind their Western comforts and freedoms to join ISIS, but why should it be a surprise that young Muslim women are as angry as their male counterparts? There is no single road map to recruitment, but for a teenager becoming a Jihadi bride or fighter is much more appealing than becoming a suicide bomber, however distorted that logic may seem to us. Full of adolescent frustration, young Muslims are being lured into a romanticized and glamorous world which bears no relation to the misery actually inflicted by ISIS. It doesn't matter if the narrative is false, because ISIS is winning the propaganda war: the inability of the mainstream to deal with the anger felt by the Muslim community provides cannon fodder for the hatemongers. ISIS is left unchallenged on double standards of foreign policy, Israel, rendition, torture, or Assad's reign, which has left 200,000 dead, because there is nothing that Western governments can say without being accused of duplicity and double standards. Aqsa's family describe her as a ""bedroom radical"" of the type the British Government has been desperate to combat by trying to shut down websites and social media. Yet last year the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence found ""little evidence to support the contention that the internet plays a dominant role in the process of radicalization."" A concentration on social media avoids the real world social relationships which help create terrorists. Many young Muslim people asserting their identity in an Islamophobic society detest the hypocrisy of their elders, whose cultural and sectarian traditions they consider irrelevant to modern day Islam. While mosques pay lip service to the ""brotherhood of man"" they exclude 50% of the community by discouraging women from attending, and anyone below the age of fifty is told to shut up and show respect. As for racial unity, it is at best tokenistic and at worst institutionally racist. Young British Muslims live a schizophrenic existence, stuck between their immigrant parents' cultural identity and that of the West which doesn't want them. Extremists exploit this identity crisis by offering them a new life. Most parents wouldn't know if their teenagers were drinking or having sex, let alone being groomed by ISIS; many young Muslims -- already adept at living a double life -- will hide their digital footprint in exactly the same way. In many cases, there is tremendous relief for parents when a teenager comes home one day and announces she is becoming religious, rather than saying she is pregnant or on drugs, but it also gives rise to a false sense of security. The failure to deal with the grooming of underage girls by ISIS is a child protection issue: when a paedophile makes contact with a child, he builds up trust over several months, convincing the child not discuss anything with her parents. When the time is right he convinces the child to leave her family and join him. The process is identical in radicalization by ISIS. Thousands of young people across Europe are at risk of being trafficked to Syria for marriage and holy war. In any other situation, they would be regarded as children -- yet pin the ISIS label on them and the knee jerk reaction is one of condemnation. The exploitation of the politics of fear combined with tougher terror laws has created a climate of fear for Muslims who are portrayed as threatening a ""civilized"" way of life. We are quick to forget recent history: the disastrous treatment of the Catholic community in Northern Ireland produced a sense of burning injustice which acted as a recruiting sergeant for the IRA for more than four decades. Today, Muslims are being dealt with in the same way.","Lawyer Aamer Anwar says ISIS's recruitment tactics differ widely from those of al Qaeda .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Iraqi forces appeared Wednesday to be making progress on the third day of a major offensive intended to push ISIS fighters out of the city of Tikrit. The Iraqi soldiers are reportedly approaching the city from five directions, as they seek to prevent ISIS militants from either escaping from Tikrit or sending in reinforcements to bolster its defense. The operation is part of a wide-scale offensive to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Sunday. It has highlighted the role played by neighboring Iran in the fight against ISIS, at a time when the United States and five other world powers are negotiating with Tehran on a controversial deal to curb its nuclear program. The semiofficial Iranian FARS news agency reports that Qassim Sulaimani, the commander of the elite Iranian Al-Quds Brigade, is helping oversee the operation to retake Tikrit. Iran has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. According to the Pentagon, there may be Iranians operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well. Despite the reported Iranian assistance, the Iraqi forces face no easy task as they seek to advance on Tikrit. Besides the direct threat posed by ISIS fighters, they must also avoid the large numbers of homemade bombs that litter the approaches to the city. Iraq has not asked the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS to provide air cover for the operation to retake Tikrit. ISIS released a number of propaganda images Wednesday, showing several vehicles and dozens of ISIS militants with their weapons, which it said were part of a military reinforcement of Salahuddin province. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the photographs. How the U.S. and Iran found common interests . Why battle for Tikrit will defeat ISIS . Tikrit fell to ISIS in June of 2014, after the group's capture of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul. Tikrit is best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. ISIS, the radical Sunni militant group, has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of Iraq and Syria. On Monday, Iraqi forces approached Tikrit from several fronts, Iraqiya TV reported, engaging with ISIS north of the city at al-Alam and south of the city at al-Dour. The element of surprise probably was not a factor, as reports of Iraqi troops amassing near Tikrit were widely shared. What awaits the Iraqi army is most likely a long, hard slog and not a quick rout. Tikrit is a big city, and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from ISIS. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. While Iraqi forces have gained some territory in the area, it has generally been under ISIS control for the last eight months or so. Prime Minister al-Abadi, who is also commander in chief of the armed forces, said on Twitter that he would ""oversee the operation to liberate Tikrit"" from ISIS. The joint Iraqi forces fighting to retake Tikrit include Iraqi troops, members of the Shia al-Hashed al-Shaabi militia, members of the Sunni Sons of Salahuddin brigades and other Sunni tribal fighters. The offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all. Rights group Human Rights Watch on Wednesday urged government forces to protect civilians from revenge attacks by pro-government militias as they fight to retake Tikrit. The rights group said it had documented ""numerous atrocities against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces"" after they recaptured other towns. Human Rights Watch also warned that ISIS could seek to use civilians as human shields. ""All commanders in Tikrit need to make sure that their forces protect civilians and allow them to flee the combat zone,"" said Joe Stork, the group's deputy Middle East and North Africa director. ""Past fighting raises grave concerns that Tikrit's civilians are at serious risk from both ISIS and government forces, and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter.""

"(CNN)Two Australians held by Indonesian authorities for nearly a decade appear to be just days away from execution by firing squad. Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, members of the so-called ""Bali Nine"" sentenced on drug smuggling charges, were transferred Wednesday from prison to a maximum security facility where they will be isolated before being put to death. Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair. They have been jailed since April 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. OPINION: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Wednesday said ""Australians are feeling sick in their guts at the prospect of execution for these two."" ""We abhor drug crime, but we abhor the death penalty. We think that these two Australians deserve to be punished, but they certainly don't deserve to be executed,"" he said. The Prime Minister said people should not let anger affect Australians' relationship with Indonesia. The two men will be given 72 hours notice of their impending appointment with a 12-member firing squad once they arrive on the island of Nusakambangan. But precisely when is unclear. They are among a number of people from different countries who are also scheduled for execution. The Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Chan, 31, was called the ringleader of the plot, and Sukumaran was described as Chan's collaborator in the scheme. Seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences. Police caught four people at the Denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies. Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after a boarding a plane to Sydney -- he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot. The Indonesian administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two Australians against President Joko Widodo. The attorneys wanted a review of the president's decision to deny them clemency. Todung Mulya Lubis, who represents the pair, said a challenge had been submitted to the administrative court and lawyers were still waiting for a court summons. ""There should be no execution as long as there is a legal process going on,"" Lubis said. Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. Their rehabilitation is genuine, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said. ""Andrew and Myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve,"" Bishop told the Australian Parliament in February. Indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers, and Widodo has made it clear he doesn't intend to introduce a policy of leniency. In December, six prisoners were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had ""severely affected"" relations with Indonesia. CNN's Camille Feanny and Jennifer Deaton contributed to this report.","Australia PM: We hate drug crime, but we hate capital punishment, too .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)The bodies of all 33 workers killed in coal mine explosion Wednesday in eastern Ukraine have been recovered, officials with the Donetsk regional authority said. Preliminary information indicates the explosion at Zasyadko mine was caused by methane gas, according to DAN, the official news agency for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). ""This did not happen because of shelling,"" an emergency services official told the news agency. The explosion occurred just before 6 a.m. local time, when 230 people were at the mine, the official website for separatist-controlled Donetsk city said. Of those, 157 were evacuated in the initial hours after the blast, including 14 injured and one dead, according to the website. Fifteen rescue teams are working at the scene, it said. Zasyadko mine is one of the most dangerous in terms of methane in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform, which reported that 240 people had died at the mine since 1999 -- 101 miners were killed in a single accident in 2007. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, speaking at a Cabinet meeting, accused the pro-Russian separatists who control the area of denying Ukrainian rescue teams access to the site, Ukrinform reported. He urged Russia to tell the separatists to allow in the rescue workers. ""You took millions of Ukrainians in Donetsk and Luhansk hostage and are now brutalizing miners' families by not letting in help,"" Ukrinform quoted him as saying. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko also called for rescuers to be allowed in. ""I demand Ukrainian rescue workers and investigators to be granted access at the site of the tragedy,"" he tweeted. However, DPR representative Denis Pushilin said Ukraine had not offered help with the rescue, and the DPR will ask Russia or separatist authorities in Luhansk for help if needed, according to the separatists' news agency. Separatist leader Aleksandr Zakharchenko issued an order to close the mine a month ago, but managers ignored the order because the mine legally belongs to Ukraine, Ukrinform cited the separatist news agency as saying. A shaky ceasefire is currently in place in Donetsk and the neighboring Luhansk region, the center of a months-long conflict between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces. Journalist Victoria Butenko reported from Kiev, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","All bodies have been recovered from the mine, officials say .

"(CNN)The reputed leader of one of Mexico's most ruthless cartels walked with his head bowed Wednesday as federal forces escorted him into an armored vehicle in the country's capital. Authorities closed in on Zetas boss Omar Trevino Morales in predawn darkness, capturing him in an operation without firing a single shot, said Monte Alejandro Rubido, head of Mexico's national security council. There are 11 pending criminal cases against him, and the crimes Trevino is accused of committing make him ""one of the most dangerous and bloodthirsty criminals in Mexico,"" said Tomas Zeron, director of criminal investigations for the Attorney General's Office. Speaking later in the day to reporters at Mexico City's airport, Zeron said the drug kingpin's legal situation would be assessed after he makes a statement to investigators. U.S. officials have requested his extradition, Zeron said. Known as ""Z-42,"" Trevino was arrested at about 3 a.m. in San Pedro Garza Garcia, a suburb of the industrial hub of Monterrey. In a simultaneous operation, five others were arrested, including the cartel's suspected financial operator, Rubido said. For the Mexican government, Trevino's arrest marks the second high-level capture of a purported drug boss in a week. Servando Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug cartel, was captured Friday in the state of Michoacan. The capture of the cartel leaders is a victory for President Enrique Peña Nieto, though the Zetas and Knights Templar are not as powerful as they once were. Still, reports of violence, corruption and extortion continue to flow from the areas of northern Mexico where the Zetas operate. The U.S. State Department was offering a reward of $5 million for information leading to the arrest of Trevino Morales. The Mexican government offered an additional $2 million. Trevino Morales is believed to have been at the helm of the Zetas since 2013, inheriting the post from his brother, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales. Miguel Angel, or ""Z-40,"" was known as a ruthless drug lord with a reputation for burning his enemies alive and ordering mass killings. His arrest in July 2013 was praised as a turning point. But while certain cartels have been weakened after their leaders are captured, critics are quick to point out that the criminal organizations survive, and new leaders rise. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration praised Mexico's government for arresting Trevino, saying he facilitated and oversaw ""huge drug shipments into the United States and elsewhere."" He faces federal drug trafficking conspiracy and money laundering charges in several jurisdictions, including Washington, D.C. and south Texas. ""The Zetas represent the worst in global organized crime: violence, intimidation, corruption, and brutal killings,"" DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a statement. ""Today's arrest strikes at the heart of the leadership structure of the Zetas and should serve as yet another warning that no criminal is immune from arrest and prosecution."" CNN's Joshua Gaynor contributed to this report.","Mexican authorities say no shots were fired when they captured the alleged head of the Zetas .

"(CNN)To beat the world's best golfers you often have to be flawless -- and that's what Inbee Park managed at the HSBC Women's Champions tournament, playing 72 holes without dropping a shot. The South Korean triumphed by two strokes from teen prodigy Lydia Ko, who took Park's world No. 1 ranking last month -- at 17 the youngest player of either gender to reach the summit. Ko, born in Korea but raised in New Zealand, had to settle for second place at Sentosa in Singapore on Sunday -- International Women's Day -- after winning her previous two events. ""She played great all week,"" Ko said of her 26-year-old rival, who will stay second when the new rankings are released next week. ""No bogeys around here and on a course where you can hit a good shot and you can get bad luck. That's pretty phenomenal."" Park, who finished 15 under par, won not only $210,000 for winning the LPGA event but also $7,500 from a bet with her dad -- with the stakes at $500 for a birdie and $1,000 for a bogey. ""This week was just incredible,"" said Park, who has held the No. 1 ranking for a total of 73 weeks in two periods and now has career prize money of nearly $10.3 million. ""I don't think I can even believe myself that I didn't make any bogeys for 72 holes."" Park led the tournament from start to finish, and closed with two-under-par 70 -- a score matched by Ko -- as she claimed her 13th LPGA Tour title.

""It's good to have a family here and they are big energy,"" said Park, who got married last October. ""This week just went so quick. I didn't have to think about golf when I'm not on the course, so I think that was a big help."" Former world No. 1 Stacey Lewis finished third, two shots behind Ko, as the American finished with a par 72. ""It was fun being in the final group. That's where you want to be.

"(CNN)With the passing of Leonard Nimoy, fans worldwide mourned the loss of the legendary performer who gave life to the Vulcan first officer on Star Trek. As Spock, Nimoy touched audiences with his commitment to the principles of science and logic, and his embrace of ""infinite diversity in infinite combinations."" Nimoy's portrayal has inspired generations to pursue careers in space, science and technology, to embrace the uniqueness of others, and to appreciate the same in themselves. It is difficult to measure the impact of Nimoy's iconic role, particularly on the science and technology communities. For decades, many of the best and brightest inventors, explorers and engineers have credited Star Trek with sparking their imaginations. For many, Spock holds a sacred spot as not only one of the most beloved characters in all of science fiction, but the earliest example of Star Trek's enduring legacy of inspiring innovation in the real world. Spock first appeared on our television screens in 1966 with the premiere of the original Star Trek series. Since then, the show has earned a reputation for predicting future technologies with remarkable accuracy. At a time when the computer age was only just beginning and the idea of handheld communication devices or tablet computers were fantasies of a far-off future, Spock could be seen working with many of these technologies aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. As we soon discovered, his incredible tools and gadgets weren't so distant after all. Soon, we moved closer to realizing these devices in our own world with the development of the integrated circuit. Portable and handheld computers were suddenly possible, and some scientists turned to Star Trek for inspiration as they sought to design the next wave of modern marvels. One such scientist was Martin Cooper, inventor of the first mobile phone, who has credited the handheld communicators used by Captain Kirk and Spock as the source of his inspiration. Even though Cooper's original cellular telephone wasn't as compact as Spock's, and most consumers couldn't afford one for some time, it wasn't long before they would become ubiquitous in our world. The same is true for the handheld computers Spock used to record scientific data. About the size of a notepad, and sometimes equipped with a stylus, these handy gadgets would go on to appear in every incarnation of the Star Trek franchise. They are known as PADDs — Personal Access Display Devices — and it's hard to ignore their influence on the the real thing. From their design and function to the name of today's most popular tablet computer, Spock may well have been the first iPad user. Another technological wonder that first appeared in Spock's hands was known as the tricorder. This mobile scanning device could be used to take readings while on an away mission to an alien planet. This data might include atmospheric conditions, radiation levels, or even the chemical composition of an object. The version Nimoy used on set was bulky and had to be worn with a shoulder strap. However, tricorders would soon become one of the most versatile and sought-after pieces of Treknology. Today, our smartphones can deliver many features of the Tricorder, while more specialized scientific and medical instruments are able to duplicate some of the more advanced scanning capabilities. It wasn't just computers and productivity gadgets that Spock brought to life on screen. He was often a proponent of passive resistance and non-violent solutions. Along with his fellow crew mates, he presented us with new ideas like weapons ""set to stun"" that formed the core of the Star Trek ethos. As we still wrestle with violence in our world, today's scientists and law enforcement are working toward breakthroughs in non-lethal weapons in an effort to prevent unnecessary loss of life. The original Star Trek series predicted or even inspired these and many other technologies in only three seasons on television. Of course, the franchise would continue this tradition with four more television series and twelve movies. Over the course of nearly 50 years, Star Trek has given us many more ideas that we've realized, like touch-screen and voice-control computer interfaces, and others we haven't quite mastered yet. Tech concepts like the universal translator, the holodeck, the replicator and, of course, the transporter hold the potential to radically change our world — and they might not be as far off as we think. Our iPhones and tablets have made touch screens commonplace, and we can communicate with Siri or Google through voice commands just like the computer on the Enterprise (though maybe not as effectively). We can instantly connect with others across great distances and even across language barriers thanks to recent advancements like Microsoft's Skype Translator technology. Meanwhile, 3D Printers allow for on-demand fabrication of many objects, and immersive virtual reality devices may soon make holographic adventures as common as video games. Scientists have even been able to transport particles of matter across distances, perhaps taking the first steps toward transporting people through space one day. As we say goodbye to Leonard Nimoy, let us remember him not only for his work as an actor on Star Trek, but for his remarkable role in the world of science and technology. Through Spock, Nimoy challenged us to understand our human nature, including our scientific curiosity, and in the process helped inspire countless men and women to reach for the stars. This is one more way that Nimoy will be remembered, in the hearts and minds of so many scientists, helping us all to ""live long and prosper.""","Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy died Friday, age 83 .

"Hong Kong (CNN)""Go back home!"" ""Locusts! You're not welcome here!"" These were just some of the insults hurled at Chinese shoppers Sunday as hundreds of Hong Kongers surged through through the old neighborhood of Yuen Long, an area close to the city's border with China. It was the latest in a series of angry protests that have seen brawls erupt in humdrum shopping malls, with demonstrators singling out the ""parallel traders"" who crowd into Hong Kong to purchase tax-free products and then resell them for a profit back in China. ""I've grown up here, and ever since a lot of the Chinese started coming into Hong Kong, things have changed,"" said Suen, a law student who only gave her surname. Clad in a mask to protect against police wielding pepper spray, she took part in the protest with her mother. Local residents say the traders are not only disturbing the peace, but are driving up the price of food, rent, and gutting local neighborhoods of their character - the city has become a blur of jewelers, pharmacies and other businesses that cater primarily to Chinese shoppers. ""Previously there were a lot of indigenous places like restaurants, but all of them have closed,"" said Suen, standing across from a store selling baby milk powder - the top item on many Chinese tourists' shopping lists. ""It's very difficult to be very welcoming."" Tensions have long been simmering between Hong Kong and the motherland, and parallel trading is just one of the thorny issues brought about by the influx of mainland Chinese to the city. A series of food scandals -- most notably in 2008 when melamine-tainted milk powder caused infant deaths across China -- led to shortages of baby milk formula in Hong Kong as Chinese flocked to buy up the city's supplies. The ensuing uproar led the government to introduce a law limiting the purchase to two tins per traveler leaving the city. Last year, 31 million Chinese visitors traveled to Hong Kong, accounting for 78% of all tourists, according to the government. But the numbers hide that the visitors aren't all sightseeing tourists in the traditional sense. There are the day-trippers, wheeling suitcases and carting boxes of goods and supplies across the border, but there is also an increasing number of wealthy mainland Chinese who are buying up luxury properties, and visit the city on a regular basis. According to the Global Property Guide, developers say as much as 40% of new home buyers are from China. Residents blame them for causing a hike in real estate prices in what reports say is already the most expensive property market in the world. Both the Chinese and Hong Kong government have encouraged mainland tourists to visit the city and boost the local economy. Relaxed restrictions have made it easy for Chinese residents to get a hold of individual multiple-entry permits -- some mainlanders enter hundreds of times a year on a single pass. This has infuriated protestors, particularly the younger generation, who want the government to scrap the permits. In a speech last Tuesday,  the city's pro-Beijing leader C.Y. Leung announced that his government would examine restricting mainland visitors, acknowledging the pressure the crowds have had on the everyday lives of Hong Kong residents. But the permit controversy is just one symptom of a deeper conflict. When it comes down to it, it's simple: Many Hong Kongers just don't feel very Chinese. According to a recent survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the number of Hong Kong residents identifying primarily as ""Chinese"" has dipped to an all-time low since the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997. The majority of respondents said they were ""Hong Kongers first, and also Chinese."" Earlier in 2012, plans to add Chinese civic education into the Hong Kong public school curriculum caused an uproar, resulting in a city-wide protest with locals claiming it would ""brainwash"" school children with pro-mainland propaganda. Hong Kong, ruled under China's principle of ""One country, two systems,"" means the city is a officially part of China, but is allowed rights and freedoms unseen in other Chinese cities. But there's one key privilege Beijing has refused to grant to Hong Kong: Free and open elections for their own leader. Frustrated Hong Kongers have tried everything to demand greater voting rights, from hunger strikes to massive street occupations, with no luck. That's why people in Hong Kong feel an increasing sense of resentment and helplessness when it comes to solving the complex, growing rift between their city and mainland China. A small but growing minority of disgruntled activists go as far as to say Hong Kong should not belong to China at all. ""We Hong Kong people have our own culture, we have our own currency, we have all the requirements to build a country."" said Julian Li, a member of a radical pro-Hong Kong group. ""For decades we have been fighting against civic rights, democracy. However, no matter how much we have been working, it's like we're begging for something that will never happen."" Many mainland Chinese are bewildered by the anger directed at them. ""It's normal for people to spend money and shop here, why are they protesting?"" said a Chinese tourist waiting at a bus stop to get away from the angry crowds. She said her suitcase was loaded with make-up and clothing that is much cheaper to buy in Hong Kong than across the border in her hometown of Zhuhai. ""There's definitely an element of discrimination against mainlanders here. I'm not saying everyone is like that in Hong Kong, but there are certain people who are very prejudiced,"" she added. Another Chinese resident who makes weekly visits to relatives in the city was sitting on a curb away from the ruckus. She said her friends have considered boycotting Hong Kong altogether. ""My friends on WeChat say, don't come to Hong Kong, let's burn our travel permits,"" she said as she thumbed through the receipts of her latest purchases. ""We should all just be more considerate and tolerant of each other, we're just here to shop. Let's just be happy,"" she said.","Hong Kong protests highlight rift between the city and mainland China .

"(CNN)And breathe. Real Madrid squeezed through to the quarterfinals of the European Champions League -- but only just. The 10-time-winner escaped a humiliating exit from the tournament after going down 4-3 at home to German side Schalke allowing it to sneak through 5-4 on aggregate. Had it not been for Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored twice to ensure his place as the record goalscorer in European football competitions, then it could have been far more embarrassing. As it was, Real's players were met with the waving of handkerchiefs and whistles on an evening which threatened to spiral from disaster into ignominy. Real's malaise has been well documented but this latest chapter, where it was hugely fortunate to escape with its hands still on the trophy, offered yet more questions than answers. Carlo Ancelotti's team have endured a difficult few weeks, but if his players had arrived at the Bernabeu hoping to silence the sniping critics then they failed miserably. This was a dire display from one of the most expensively assembled teams on the planet, who but for arguably the world's greatest player, would have succumbed to one of the most embarrassing defeats in the club's illustrious history. Make no bones about it - Real was rumbled. Schalke, produced a fine performance, full of courage, energy and a zest which their opponent could scarcely match. Had it not been for one player on the opposing side then perhaps this would have been one of the most famous nights in Schalke's history. Unfortunately, that one player was Ronaldo. As lethargic  and lackadaisical as Real was throughout the contest, Ronaldo's two goals, both headers, ensured its place in the next round. Nobody has scored more goals than Ronaldo in European club football -- his 77th and 78th taking him to the top of the chart ahead of his nemesis, Lionel Messi. His latest efforts may not have been the most spectacular, but they were so very precious given the nature of the tie. Leading 2-0 from the first leg in Gelsenkirchen, Real was firm favorite to progress. No team in the history of the competition had lost the first leg 2-0 at home and managed to progress -- and Schalke appeared unlikely to alter that statistic. Coached by Roberto di Matteo, who led Chelsea to Champions League glory in 2012, Schalke arrived hoping to give a good account of themselves, according to the Italian. Fifth in the German league, this was hardly a team which was supposed to send Madrid into a meltdown -- and yet that's what came to fruition. But, given the recent form of the Carlo Ancelotti's side, perhaps this was not so unexpected. Last weekend's league defeat at Athletic Bilbao brought about a new wave of criticism for Ancelotti. Toppled from the summit by arch rival Barcelona, Real has struggled  in recent weeks for consistency by its own high standards. Its astounding 22-game winning streak was curtailed by Valencia on January 4 and the style and swagger which was so evident during that run soon fell away. A 4-0 defeat by champion and city rival Atletico in February was difficult to stomach as was the defeat in the Basque country to Bilbao -- but Real's problems stretch beyond results. Real began slowly, in fact, slowly would have been an improvement on what was quite a dreadful opening period. Those in white shirts appeared to be running in slow motion as Schalke took the contest to its opponent with a zest and spirit which Real could not match. Having already fired several warning shots, Schalke finally made the breakthrough its energy and enterprise deserved when Christian Fuchs fired home after good work by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. Real, abject in the extreme, appeared bereft of ideas, short on confidence and as if those on the field had merely stumbled upon the stadium's turf without actually meeting one another. Fortunately, in Ronaldo, Real has a man who has power beyond those of his fellow mortals. Schalke's lead lasted just five minutes -- Ronaldo finding both time and space inside the penalty area before heading home from close range. That strike, his 40th of the season, should have settled the home side down. Yet, what followed, was another example of Real's fragility. First, Huntelaar, once a Real player, pounced upon Raphael Varane's dreadful backpass only for his effort to lack the necessary power. Soon after, the Dutchman struck the crossbar with a fine volley from 25-yards which left Iker Casillas, the Real goalkeeper, clutching at thin air. Schalke sensed its opportunity and with four minutes of the first half it finally struck when Max Meyer, the 19-year-old, fired home after Casillas had fumbled Huntelaar's effort. Real was reeling -- and yet it was Ronaldo once again who got it out of trouble. Fabio Coentrao, the left-back, produced a fine cross and Ronaldo eased away from his marker to head his second of the game. That should have been that for Schalke, at least Real might have felt that way when Karim Benzema put his side ahead for the first time on the night. The Frenchman danced his way through the defense before coolly netting Real's third of the evening with eight minutes of the second period played. While Real continued to threaten in attack, its defense remained suspect. Leroy Sane, just 19 years of age, was the next beneficiary of the home side's reluctance to put pressure on the ball. The midfielder was allowed both time and space to take aim and curl a quite sumptuous effort into the far corner past the watching Casillas. Real, unbeaten at home in the Champions League since April 2011, remained vulnerable, particularly at the heart of the midfield. It was one of those midfielders, Luka Modric, back from injury, whose mistake gave Huntelaar the opportunity to set up a pulsating finish. Modric's loose pass allowed the forward to take the ball in his stride before unleashing an unstoppable effort which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar. As the whistles rang out, those in blue poured forward with the impressive Sane forcing Casillas into a fine stop as the visitors edged closer and closer to an all important fifth goal. With the clock ticking down, Schalke threw everyone forward in search of a dramatic winner -- but when the ball broke to Benedikt Howedes, the defender could only fire his shot straight at Casillas. The referee's whistle brought relief, though the howls of derision from the home supporters gave the players an idea of their recent failings. ""Getting through to the next round is very important for us, sometimes you have to suffer and this will make us stronger,"" said Modric. ""We have to get back to playing the way we were at the start of the season, we have a lot of quality and I think that we're going to see a much better Real Madrid in the next game."" Porto power through . In the night's other game, Porto trounced Swiss side FC Basel 4-0 to secure a 5-1 aggregate victory. Porto, winners in 2004 under Jose Mourinho, eased home courtesy of goals from Yacine Brahimi, Hector Herrera, Casemiro and Vincent Aboubakar. ""You have to applaud the entire team for this fantastic performance against a very difficult opponent who came here determined to qualify,"" Julen Lopetegui, the Porto coach, told reporters. ""We deserve to be in the Champions League quarterfinals even if we came through qualifying.

"(CNN)Italian authorities have arrested 42 people suspected of belonging to a mafia network in southern Italy, some of whom are accused of extorting tens of thousands of euros from businesses monthly, police said Tuesday. Among the evidence: A piece of paper, hidden in a bicycle handlebar, that listed businesses that the crime syndicate was extorting, according to the Carabinieri, Italy's military police. The Carabinieri said they made the arrests while raiding homes in 11 provinces. The crime network is based in Casal di Principe, a village roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Naples, police said. The mafia network extorted shop owners to the tune of 200,000 euros a month and extorted operators of slot machines and online gambling a further 100,000 euros monthly, the Carabinieri said. The arrests stem from an investigation that started in October 2012. Investigators also found notebooks with the group's organizational chart and names of jailed associates who still were on the mafia payroll, according to the Carabinieri. The note in the bicycle handlebar was among other ""pizzini,"" or little pieces of paper allegedly used by mafia members to exchange information, that investigators discovered in the probe, the military police said. In Villa Literno, close to Casal di Principe, investigators discovered a bunker that allegedly was used to hide fugitive affiliates of the mafia, the Carabinieri said. An anti-mafia prosecutor in Naples filed charges against the 42, including mafia association, extortion and illegal possession of weapons.","Police say a note hidden in a bike's handlebar listed extorted businesses .

"(CNN)Early Thursday -- during the ongoing protests that continue to shake Ferguson, Missouri -- two police officers were shot. Such violence and lawlessness should never be tolerated. But the unrest during which it occurred demonstrates that the people of Ferguson have lost all confidence in their police department. And the resignation of the police chief this week won't be enough to restore faith in law and order. Everyone in the department needs to step down so the department can be rebuilt from the ground up. It is easy to see why. After a police officer shot Michael Brown, the U.S. Department of Justice conducted an investigation into the Ferguson Police Department. What investigators found was a ""pattern and practice"" of discrimination against African-Americans. In a town with a black population of 67%, black people represented 85% of vehicle searches, 90% of the traffic violations and 93% of the arrests. There is no way to justify this. Now, the Department of Justice has an opportunity to gut the Ferguson Police Department and rebuild it from scratch. In fact, it's more than an opportunity: It's a necessity. In the court of law, there is an old closing argument that goes like this: You sit down, pour yourself a bowl of stew and find that the first piece of meat that you taste is rancid. You don't put just that piece aside; you throw out the whole bowl. Lawyers use this story to say that if you catch a witness lying about one thing, then you can't believe anything they say. Unfortunately, it is an analogy that can be applied to the Ferguson Police Department. The Department of Justice report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department cannot be ignored, and the problems it reveals cannot be fixed from the inside. If there are a few good cops in the Ferguson Police Department, they need to leave, and they need to go elsewhere to continue their proud law enforcement career without being overshadowed by their involvement in a poisoned organization. In fact, everyone in the Ferguson Police Department needs to leave, from the top to the bottom. The police department should be completely reconstituted under Department of Justice control in a manner that ensures that citizens of Ferguson receive the type of public service they pay for and deserve -- and more importantly, in a manner that protects their rights, not only as citizens of Ferguson, Missouri, but as constitutionally protected citizens of our country. A completely rebuilt Ferguson Police Department, established with a charter to enforce the law with equality, could serve as an example for every law enforcement agency in the country. A new Ferguson Police Department could show what a concerted, roots-up effort toward nonracist behavior in a police department can be. Under Justice Department leadership, the Ferguson Police Department could become a model for practices such as equipping all police with body cameras, community policing and better use of force training. If we can create from the ashes of the Ferguson Police Department a model that works, it may provide some consolation for minorities who have been disproportionately targeted by law enforcement. And if the black community in Ferguson -- in fact, people of every race in Ferguson -- can look back five years from now and see an unbiased organization of public servants who give respect and get respect, who reduce fear rather than cause it, then perhaps the tragedy of Michael Brown's death will stand for something.","Mark O'Mara: Justice Department says Ferguson has record of racial discrimination .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)A Turkish Airlines jet carrying 224 people skidded off a runway Wednesday morning at Kathmandu's airport, forcing those on board to evacuate and effectively shutting down Nepal's lone international airport, authorities said. The Airbus A330's crew first tried landing the plane around 7 a.m. Wednesday (8:30 p.m. ET Tuesday), getting very close to a runway but not touching down, according to passenger Deepak Malhotra. That was followed by an announcement that the aircraft couldn't land due to poor visibility. About 45 minutes later, though, the crew tried again. This time, the Turkish Airlines plane did get on the ground but it didn't stay on the runway, according to airport officials. The aircraft skidded off, screeching to a stop with its nose pitched down. Pictures showed passengers and crew going down evacuation slides and walking through heavy fog. Despite the rough landing, there were no reports of serious injuries, according to a Turkish Airlines spokesman. Still, the incident did manage to knock out air travel in and out of the Tribhuvan International Airport, the only way in for foreigners wanting to explore Mount Everest and other nearby peaks in the Himalayan Mountains. That's because part of the now-immobile Airbus A330 was covering a section of the runway. Nepal doesn't have the heavy-duty machinery required to move it, said Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, the head of the mountainous Asian nation's Civil Aviation Authority.  And large cargo planes that could be brought in to help with the job have nowhere to land now. Having them land anywhere else in Nepal isn't an option either. Instead, authorities are exploring possibly flying in needed equipment to India and then driving it over to Nepal. Until then, all international flights into Kathmandu have been called off until further notice. That includes 40 arriving and 40 departing flights canceled Wednesday. Journalist Manesh Shrestha reported from Kathmandu, CNN's Sugam Pokharel reported from India and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","A Turkish Airlines jet carrying 224 people skids upon landing in Kathmandu .

"Beijing (CNN)China has linked violence in its far-western Muslim region of Xinjiang to ISIS and says Chinese nationals have fought for the extremist group. The Communist Party chief of Xinjiang -- the region's top official -- told reporters Tuesday to view mounting violence there in the context of a global jihadist movement, especially with the rise of ISIS -- also known as the Islamic State or IS. ""Some extremists in Xinjiang have participated in the IS and I think this further proves that intentional extremist forces cannot be ignored,"" said Zhang Chunxian on the sidelines of the annual session of China's rubber-stamp parliament. ""As countries around the world have realized the dangers of IS... we will work with others to stop it at its source."" A spate of violent attacks in Xinjiang -- a resource-rich area long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking Uyghurs -- has killed hundreds of people in the past two years. The government has blamed the incidents on Muslim Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state. China's state media had earlier reported on Muslim Uyghur militants trying to flee the country and join ISIS training camps in preparation for attacks back home. ""We cracked some cases involving people who had just returned after directly participating in fighting,"" Zhang revealed. ""Such cases sometimes involve 'lone wolves' and other times involve groups."" ""The IS situation is historically unprecedented,"" he added, addressing criticism on the Xinjiang government's lack of transparency. ""To solve such cases... to ensure people's safety, we sometimes have to keep things confidential and take our time."" Exiled Uyghur activists have long disputed the Chinese government's assertions, pointing to the lack of evidence and accusing the authorities of using the alleged ISIS connection to justify their increasingly harsh rule in the region. Over the past decades, the arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese, the country's predominant ethnic group, has fueled ethnic tensions. Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in housing, education and employment, as well as curtailed religious freedom. Other critics have attributed the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's repressive reign there -- a claim the government vehemently denies.","China has linked violence in its far-western Muslim region of Xinjiang to ISIS .

"(CNN)The big search is over. That's the message out of Indonesia, where national search and rescue chief Bambang Soelistyo announced that the main search-and-recovery operation surrounding doomed commercial airliner AirAsia Flight 8501 officially ended Tuesday. ""These past two months have been the hardest times for all of us at AirAsia and for the families of QZ8501 passengers,"" AirAsia Indonesia CEO Sunu Widyatmoko said. ""No words can express how grateful we are for all the prayers, love and support given us."" He was referring to the nightmare that the airline and, especially, the loved ones of the 162 people on board the Airbus A320-200 jet have been experiencing since its crew lost contact with air traffic controllers on December 28. Indonesian Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan later explained the plane climbed rapidly, then stalled shortly before it crashed. Unlike Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared a year ago and still hasn't been located, there has been less mystery and more closure over Flight QZ8501. That's because searchers did find remnants from the AirAsia aircraft and the remains of some passengers in the Java Sea. That included the jetliner's fuselage, the last major piece of which was recovered late last month and brought into a Jakarta port earlier this week. As of Tuesday, authorities had identified the bodies of 94 who had been on the AirAsia plane, with six other bodies still in Surabaya's Bhayangkara Hospital. Yet that leaves scores of other families still waiting. The decision to call off the main search stems from the fact no more human remains were found in the past week, Soelistyo explained. But that doesn't mean authorities won't be looking at all. There will be a smaller-scale operation, involving divers and three vessels, over the next week, according to Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency. After that, the plan is to call off the search entirely.","Flight QZ8501 went down in December with 162 on board; 100 bodies have been recovered so far .

"(CNN)The image of the braided Kurdish female fighter, donning military camouflage and taking up arms against the militant group ISIS, may have done more to promote the Kurdish cause in the West than anything else in recent years. The Iraqi Kurds have long been pro-Western in orientation, but Western powers have often only moderately addressed their pleas for support, in part out of fear of empowering the secessionist minority to seek independence. Now, with soccer moms in Middle America tweeting photos of Kurdish female fighters, Western governments may find it harder to explain their tepid Kurdish policies to their constituencies. Jacob Russell's sensitive photo essay brings much-needed nuance to the recent proliferation of images of Kurdish female fighters. Since last summer, international media -- and Kurdish politicians who have recognized the public relations value of the images -- often objectified these women. Images of smiling young female fighters brandishing weapons with a hint of glamour (""girls with guns,"" as Russell calls this type of portrayal) tend to portray more of the photographer's assumptions about the woman's emancipation than her actual experiences as a Kurdish woman in combat. Russell consciously avoids this uncomplicated portrayal of female fighters. ""I was wary of making images that fed into this idea of the heroic strong women fighters,"" he said. ""I think that the female fighters are used quite cynically by Kurdish leaders (who) know very well how attractive this image is to the Western media."" Having lived in Kurdistan for nearly two years, Russell understands that many women join the Peshmerga or other Kurdish forces for unglamorous reasons. Many of the women he photographed turned to the Peshmerga to escape abusive marriages or other forms of repression women continue to face there. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""A lot of the women's backstories were quite difficult,"" he said. ""It seemed like this unit provided an alternative network for women who maybe would struggle in normal Kurdish society, because despite being relatively progressive (within the Middle East), it is still quite a conservative society."" Russell explores the theme of sisterhood, and in one image he captures the women in an intimate moment in the back of a pickup truck, their fingers intertwined. That photo, he says, is his favorite from the shoot. ""I think that image is one of the more expressive ones that (shows) what really seems to be going on there,"" he said. ""I didn't want to take pictures that conveyed the idea that this was all about hardcore fighters going into battle and killing lots of (ISIS) fighters. That just didn't seem to be the case."" Russell remarks that the image of the female fighter carries an important social role, conveying to the world the (relatively) progressive values that Kurds pride themselves on. The women now serve a political role, too. As Western governments eye more military engagement with Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria, these women may boost the Kurds' international standing.

"(CNN)The attack on Tunisia's famed Bardo Museum is just the latest evidence that parts of North and sub-Saharan Africa have become a magnet for Islamist extremism. Tunisia -- lying just across the Mediterranean from Europe, but bordered on one side by Libya and on the other by Algeria -- has until now not suffered the kind of large-scale terror attacks seen in both those nations in recent years. But it has emerged as a place of increasing concern as the threat of Islamist extremism has intensified in the region. Islamist terrorists also have struck in Algeria, where they killed at least 37 hostages at a gas field in 2013, and in Libya, where terrorists killed the U.S. ambassador and three others in 2012 and where ISIS has established a beachhead in the east. Al Qaeda's North African offshoot Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has its roots in Algeria, has captured territory in Mali and taken hostages -- often Europeans -- in countries such as Niger and Mauritania. So what is the world doing about it? The United States has created a military command in Africa and also established a special operations base in Djibouti, which borders Somalia in the Horn of Africa. France has sent troops to Mali. And, as CNN recently reported from Chad, Western militaries have trained special forces from several northern African nations to take on the Islamists. Here's a country-by-country look -- although not exhaustive -- at how Islamist extremism has reared its head across a swath of Africa. Algeria is home to a long-running Islamist insurgency. In perhaps the highest-profile incident, Islamist militants attacked the In Amenas oil and gas plant in southern Algeria in January 2013. At least 37 hostages, including three U.S. citizens, died in the seizure of, and ensuing special forces assault on, the remote facility. Dozens of assailants also died in the days-long siege. The attack was the work of the Mulathameen Brigade, which translates as the ""Signatories in Blood Brigade."" Last September, another Islamist group beheaded a 55-year-old French hiker, Herve Gourdel, after seizing him as he walked in Djudjura National Park in central Algeria. Days earlier, the outfit -- Jund al Khilafa, a splinter group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- had pledged allegiance to ISIS. Militants affiliated with AQIM had previously also kidnapped foreigners in Algeria, including Italians and Spaniards. In 2007, AQIM launched a suicide bombing campaign in Algeria, which included a deadly bombing against the U.N. headquarters in Algiers. In January, a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital, Tripoli, killed 10 people, including an American. The attack was swiftly claimed by Wilayat al-Tarabulus, ISIS' name for the province. Politicians in Tripoli disputed the claim. Besides its growing presence in Tripoli, ISIS is now the dominant force in Derna in eastern Libya and controls parts of the town center of Sirte, the hometown of former Libya strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Before the advent of ISIS, an Islamist group called Ansar al Shariah was blamed by the United States for carrying out the September 11,  2012, attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi in which Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. State Department computer expert Sean Smith and former U.S. Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, then acting as security contractors, also died. In 2012, Islamist extremists capitalized on chaos in Mali after a military coup and uprising by Tuareg tribesmen to seize control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. France intervened militarily in early 2013 and helped to push back the Islamists. Since then, Mali's government has battled various rebel factions, mostly in its northern region, with the help of French and African forces. Recent attacks include a shooting earlier this month at a bar popular with expatriates in the capital, Bamako, which killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. AQIM issued a warning to France via jihadist websites in January, following terror attacks in Paris, stating that ""France pays the cost of its violence on Muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity,"" citing the presence of its soldiers in Mali. According to analysis by Jane's Defence Weekly, despite the shift of jihadist activity east toward Libya, ""Mauritania is still an aspirational target for jihadist groups due to its military co-operation with France and Algeria."" Jihadist groups including AQIM and the Mulathameen Brigade operate in the porous border areas between Mauritania, Algeria, Mali, Niger and Libya. Militants have in the past kidnapped foreign workers for ransom, including three Spaniards in 2011, according to Jane's. However, since 2011 jihadist activity in the country has declined. Mauritanian troops joined the fight against AQIM militants in Mali. Militant group Boko Haram has waged a campaign of terror in mostly northern Nigeria for over a decade. It has attacked the country's police, military, banks, bus stations and crowded markets, as well carrying out a string of church bombings. Perhaps the most notorious incident came last April, when Boko Haram militants kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school in Chibok, in Borno state. Most of the girls remain missing. In January this year, hundreds of Boko Haram gunmen seized the town of Baga and neighboring villages in northern Nigeria, as well as a multinational military base, leaving bodies scattered everywhere and as many as 2,000 people feared dead. The group's stated aim is to institute Sharia, or Islamic law. Earlier this month, in an audio message purportedly from leader Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS. It had previously declared ties to AQIM. Al-Shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond, notably neighboring Kenya. Its most high-profile attack came in that country in 2013, when gunmen struck at Nairobi's upscale Westgate mall, pulling out weapons and gunning down shoppers. The gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them. As many as 67 people died in the siege. The group has carried out numerous attacks in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, and elsewhere. Just last week, its target was government offices in the city of Baidoa. It has also recently called for attacks on shopping malls in the United States, Canada and Britain. The Pentagon said this week that a key Al-Shabaab operative connected to the Westgate mall attack, named as Adan Garar, was killed recently by a U.S. drone strike. In September, Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was also killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city. Gunmen who besieged the Bardo Museum in Tunis are thought to have claimed 23 lives, most of them foreign tourists. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui told national radio that the assailants were Islamists, but authorities haven't been more specific than that. Nine arrests have been made in connection with the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in an audio message posted online Thursday. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the audio statement. The attack occurred even as the country's democratically elected Parliament was meeting to discuss new anti-terror legislation. Up to 3,000 Tunisians are believed to have traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight as jihadists, more than any other country, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization in London. The fear is that many of these fighters will return to North Africa to join ISIS-affiliated groups there and carry out attacks. Al Qaeda's North African affiliate is also a threat. In late 2012, AQIM set up a branch in Tunisia called the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade, a 60-strong Jihadi outfit composed of Tunisians, Algerians, and some Libyans. The group, believed to include fighters driven out of Mali by French forces, has been responsible for a string of attacks on Tunisian security services in mountainous Djebel Chaambi region along the Algerian border. CNN's Tim Lister and Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","Islamist extremism poses a growing threat in parts of North and sub-Saharan Africa .

"(CNN)India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has told all news channels not to air a controversial documentary about rape in India -- warning that the excerpts ""appear to encourage and incite violence against women."" The BBC Storyville documentary was originally scheduled to air Sunday, but due to the ""intense level of interest"" in the program, the BBC aired it Wednesday in the UK on BBC Four ""to enable viewers to see this incredibly powerful documentary at the earliest opportunity,"" the broadcaster said in a statement. The documentary was released online and the hashtag #IndiasDaughter was trending in the UK after it aired. The documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case that sparked massive outrage and protests in India. An Indian court restricted the publication and airing of the film in India as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after Mukesh Singh's comments were released in several media outlets. Singh appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night, according to the documentary called ""India's Daughter."" ""The media is likely to be seen as a voice for the perpetrator of such crimes by providing him a medium to communicate his views on the matter repeatedly,"" said a letter sent to media outlets by the Indian government. Despite the ban, the documentary can be seen on YouTube in India. Singh told the documentary crew that his victim ""should just be silent and allow the rape."" ""A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night,"" he told the BBC. ""A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. ""Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes."" He suggested that they ""had a right to teach them a lesson."" In a statement, India's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview, which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage. Home Minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament on Wednesday that permission would not be granted to anyone in the future to interview prison inmates after the uproar over the documentary. ""The government has taken necessary legal action and obtained a restraining order from the court disseminating the contents of the film,"" according to the statement. India's constitution guarantees free speech with a caveat that it could be restricted when speech is deemed a threat to public order, incitement to an offense or an act of contempt of court. In December 2012, a young woman was savagely attacked and raped by a group of men aboard a public bus in New Delhi and later died from her injuries. Mukesh Singh, who was driving the bus, is now on death row and has filed an appeal. His comments in the documentary have stirred fierce debate about whether airing his interview gives him a platform to share his misogyny, versus those who say it increases awareness and understanding of the horror of rape. The documentary's director, Leslee Udwin, wrote that she was ""deeply saddened"" by attempts to silence the film. ""India should be embracing this film -- not blocking it with a knee-jerk hysteria without even seeing it. This was an opportunity for India to continue to show the world how much has changed since this heinous crime,"" she wrote for India's NDTV. Udwin later spoke to NDTV, urging everyone to watch the film before rushing to judgment on it. ""I appeal to the Prime Minister to not let it go out of hand because it is getting out of hand. Countries around the world will very soon be saying: 'How dare India ban a documentary that is in the public interest?' I urge you to see the film as soon as possible,"" she said. ""Please see the film and then talk about it."" Several supporters of the film echoed the notion that even airing the repugnant views increases awareness and points to a more systematic problem. One said that it is the role of journalism to report ""on the sickness,"" and actress Freida Pinto asked: ""Airing the truth a crime? How?"" One journalist expressed concerns that the use of prior restraint amounted to censorship by the government and set a precedent. The debate in social media caused hashtags #NirbhayaInsulted and #IndiasDaughter to trend in India. Many criticized the documentary for giving rapists a platform to share their thoughts and justify rape. One asked why ""rapists are treated as celebrities."" Lawyer and prominent feminist Indira Jaising called the filmmaker ""irresponsible."" ""Creating public space for them, encouraging tolerance of any form of violence, what the film will do, it will project justifications for rape -- which I think is completely wrong. It's going on public view where young people will be seeing it, there's no guarantee these convicts won't be seen as natural role models for most."" Many questioned how Udwin was able to obtain 16 hours of interviews with the imprisoned Singh. The home minister told the upper house of Parliament on Wednesday that no one would be allowed to ""leverage"" the 2012 gang rape for commercial purposes. He also said that the filmmakers violated the conditions for the shoot inside Tihar prison and that officials would determine who granted permission for the interview. One prominent feminist said she opposed airing the documentary because it infringed on India's laws. Singh and three other convicts are currently appealing their death sentences. Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association, said she didn't have a problem with people viewing the film but said the timing was not appropriate. ""The concern is that the airing of the documentary will result in a media trial -- that will essentially leave the judiciary with no option but to uphold the death penalty,"" she said. ""My main problem, how can we screen this documentary when there's an appeals process underway?"" Krishnan suggested that the documentary's title, ""India's Daughter,"" inferred that Indians were badly in need of a rescue mission, leaving the impression of a ""white savior"" complex. ""India's Daughter"" is directed by Udwin, a British woman who spent two years on the project. She said she was inspired by the mass protests that followed the gang rape case in Delhi. Among the voices in the debate, some were critical of what they perceived as Western bias that depicts India as a place of misogyny when rape and sexual assaults are universal. ""I have tried to convey that while we in India are in fact engaged in confronting the violence and discrimination against women here, it does not help for people in other countries to imagine that such brutality is India's 'cultural' problem; that India's 'backwardness' is the problem; or that gender violence is 'worse out there in India,'"" Krishnan wrote.

"(CNN)Modern women are suffering from an energy crisis. Competing in the workplace, caring for aging parents and trying teenagers, and busier than ever, we use anything we can to duct-tape our lives and ourselves together: comfort foods, alcohol, energy drinks, and an expanding array of antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, painkillers and amphetamines. All in an effort to maintain our unnatural pace. Welcome to the increasingly altered states of America. Americans are about 5% of the world's population, yet we take half its pills, and 80% of its painkillers.This over-medication has led to record numbers of opiate overdoses and also to a growing number of women taking antidepressants -- one out of four and counting, according to a report issued by the pharmacy benefit manager, Medco. This is creating a ""new normal,"" bringing closer the tipping point for when other women will seek chemical assistance. Like steroids in baseball, when everyone starts doing it, the players who don't are at a disadvantage. The overuse of psychiatric medication is called cosmetic psychopharmacology, and it's like cosmetic surgery: as more women get breast implants, the rest of us feel flat chested. But the new normal isn't normal at all. Certain antidepressants called SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) create artificially stable and elevated levels of serotonin, the brain chemical that helps regulate mood, which can dampen empathy and emotional reactivity, while higher doses can engender apathy. Women are naturally moody. Our moods change, and this emotional fluidity helps us to be adaptable and resilient. We are dynamic and responsive to our environment. There is a biological advantage to this sensitivity; we need to know what our nonverbal babies need, what our mates are thinking and to sense danger in our surroundings. Moodiness -- being sensitive, caring deeply and occasionally being acutely dissatisfied -- is actually a natural source of power. It helps to ensure not only our survival, but that of our offspring. Women's emotionality is a sign of health, not disease, and it is our single biggest psychological asset. Yet many of us are being convinced to medicate it away. The pharmaceutical industry spends billions in payments to physicians and direct to consumer advertising. Nine out of 10 pharmaceutical companies spend less on research and development than marketing.Steady doses of antidepressant advertising aimed at women advance the question from ""Should I take an antidepressant?"" to ""Which one should I take?"" These medications can have more far-reaching effects than most people realize, blunting empathy, passion, and sensitivity. SSRIs dampen sexual desire and response, making it difficult to climax and interfering with the evaluation of potential romantic partners. SSRIs also make it hard to cry, an important signal to ourselves and those around us that something is very wrong. Tears, and the emotions beneath them, can offer a profound lesson in how people's behavior affects others. We cry when we're touched by the poignancy of humanity, or when we're angry, or frustrated by injustice. And yet, women apologize for their tears, especially in the workplace, where we've been socialized to shut down expressed emotion; it interferes with our typical agenda of forward-momentum, and it makes people uncomfortable. The problem with shutting it down is that we're stifling a piece that we need, that our partners and families need, and that society needs, particularly as women continue to ascend to the upper reaches of business and government. The world needs more compassion, sensitivity, intuition and empathy. War, rape, murder, and corporate malignancy will flourish in their absence. Change comes from discomfort -- and awareness that something is wrong. Sadness and fear are not always symptoms to be medicated. Anxiety and tension come foremost from the denial of emotions, from their repression. My patients want to feel better, but really what many of them need is to get better at feeling. The shame that for centuries has been used by our culture to separate men from their true feelings is now spreading to women, who, by their biology, are the last and much needed connection to this natural place. As we embrace new technologies, we need to be careful that we don't go too far away from nature and what's natural for us as social primates. We insist on all natural products in our baby food and household cleaners. Why don't we insist on natural moods for ourselves? If we can live in a way that is more aligned to what is genuine for us, we will be calmer, more at peace and more fulfilled. But we are drowning in artificiality. There is a ""plastic vortex"" of garbage the size of Texas floating in the Pacific Ocean, synthetic fillers in our breasts and faces, virtual sex partners on our computers and artificially enhanced rationality from serotonergic antidepressants. We compulsively consume this fakery without satiation or satisfaction, because it is impossible to fill up on something that is almost enough. We need a course correction, away from the synthetic, so that we can live lives that honor how we feel. But to do that, we must be able to feel, to be our moody, authentic selves. That is the first step to wellness and to wholeness. Medicating yourself into complacency may leave you unshaken, but it also may leave you unfeeling and apathetic, making it impossible to address the causes of your pain.  Don't put the alarm on mute.","Julie Holland: American women taking too many anti-depressants, blunting their valuable emotional reactivity, creating new normal .

"(CNN)The sun cuts across Lake Nicaragua, casting shadows across lush flora and brightly colored boats. Rowing in unison, two girls paddle a canoe to school. Life on Lake Nicaragua is peaceful, rustic and isolated, but this could change with the pending completion of a canal that builders are likening to Panama's famed waterway. Headed by Hong Kong-based consortium HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Company (HKND), the $50 billion Nicaragua Canal (also called the Nicaragua Grand Canal and Interoceanic Canal) would create a gargantuan new shipping route through Nicaragua by connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. HKND was granted a 50-year concession by the Nicaraguan government in 2013 to build and operate the 278-kilometer (172 miles) canal, reportedly with the option for an extension. Construction will run from the Rio Punta Gorda on the Caribbean Coast to Brito on the Pacific. At up to 1,700 feet wide and 90 feet deep, the canal, if completed, will be deeper and wider than the Panama Canal. HKND announced the start of construction of the canal with a ceremony on December 22, 2014. The canal will run through Lake Nicaragua (among other areas), Central America's largest lake and freshwater reservoir, which not only preserves an integral part of Nicaragua's ecosystem, but directly supports numerous communities. By some estimates, 30,000 people will have to be relocated to carve a path for the canal. The prospect is nothing short of alarming for those living in the area, and those who cherish its untouched splendor. With the pending completion of the canal in 2019, Lake Nicaragua may be impacted in ways only time will reveal. Environmental experts worry that the shallow waters of the lake won't be able to withstand the dredging that will come with construction. Additionally, communities will likely be displaced and wetlands may become more vulnerable to destruction. ""In terms of the canal impact on Lake Nicaragua, one big concern is the damage to the quality of the water; the ship traffic will pollute the water with toxic sediments and industrial chemicals and introduce destructive invasive species, plants and animals,"" Dr. Jorge A. Huete-Perez, vice president of the Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and director of the Molecular Biology Center at the University of Central America told CNN. ""Dredging of the lake for the construction of the canal will render the lake a 'dead zone' because of hypoxia, eutrophication and turbidity."" In January, London-based scidev.net reported that an independent commission of experts -- including scientists from the InterAmerican Network of Academies of Science, Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and International Council for Science -- had reached similar conclusions, warning of ""unintended adverse consequences that could do economic, environmental and social harm."" Like other critics of the canal construction, Huete-Perez wants greater transparency from HKND and the Nicaraguan government. ""This whole thing has been fast-tracked without public consultations or the opportunity for an informed, documented debate,"" said Huete-Perez. On January 9, 2015, HKND responded to concerns about the lake's impact on communities in a statement on its website. ""From July 21 to July 30, 2014, we and our environmental and social impact advisor, Environmental Resources Management (ERM), held scoping meetings across Nicaragua.  Approximately 5,000 people participated in the scoping meetings, including housewives, students, professionals, agricultural producers, fishermen, artisans, businessmen and scholars,"" reads the company's statement, in part. The company says it held a press conference broadcast in real time to the public to announce the route of the canal and comment on the technical, geological, cultural and environmental impact of the project. Some skeptics doubt the hyper-ambitious canal is realistic. Pedro Alvarez, chairman of civil engineering at Rice University, has expressed doubts that it will ever be completed. He worries that it will be abandoned. His greatest concern is severe damage to Lake Nicaragua. Despite the concerns of environmental experts, the project is underway, making a visit to this beautiful area more compelling than ever. Largely unmarred by development, Lake Nicaragua is a sight to behold. During my recent guided visit with Nicaragua Vacations, I took a boat tour through the Islets of Granada, home to 365 scattered islands with majestic views of Mombacho volcano. At times, there was no other boat in sight -- only the rustle of a hidden howler monkey in the bushes and the volcano, ensconced in clouds and morning fog. The feeling of being everywhere and nowhere at once is part of Lake Nicaragua's charm. Another part of its charm is the people who live on it. At Padre Nello School on Lake Nicaragua, about 90 children canoe to school each day. Jicaro Island EcoLodge works with Padre Nello to bring clean water to the children and educational projects that encourage sustainability on the lake. Guests of the lodge can arrange visits. The islets are just southeast of the city of Granada (population approximately 120,000), where colonial buildings defy time, narrow alleyways lead to garden courtyards, charming boutiques are full of local art and street carts overflow with everything from iguanas to cashews. While Granada pulses with Old World charm, Lake Nicaragua stands still with nature as its compass, mostly untouched by modernity. For now. Nicaragua Vacations; +1 866 347 4012 .

"Paris (CNN)International arrest warrants have been issued for three men suspected of having carried out a 1982 attack on a Jewish restaurant in Paris, the spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor said Wednesday. Six people were killed and 22 injured in the attack on the Jo Goldenberg kosher restaurant on Rue des Rosiers in the French capital's central Marais district. The three suspects live in Ramallah, West Bank; Jordan; and Norway, the prosecutor's spokeswoman, Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, told CNN. According to CNN's French affiliate BFMTV, a live grenade was thrown into the restaurant, in the heart of Paris' historic Jewish quarter, in August 1982 when it was packed with customers. The attackers then opened fire with guns. Investigators attributed the attack at the time to a Palestinian splinter group, BFMTV reported, but no group claimed responsibility. News of the arrest warrants comes at a time of at a time of heightened sensitivity in France over religion and terrorist threats. Four people were killed in a terror attack in January on a kosher supermarket in Paris by an Islamist extremist, Amedy Coulibaly, who also shot a policewoman. Two other gunmen killed 12 more people in an attack on the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine, targeted because it published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. Several cemeteries were also vandalized last month, with the damage including swastikas scrawled inside two Jewish cemeteries. CNN's Sandrine Amiel reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.","Paris prosecutor: Arrest warrant is issued for three men suspected in the 1982 attack .

"(CNN)Robots serve you drinks, you can skydive on deck and a mechanical arm hoists you 300 feet into the air to view the ship. You could be forgiven for thinking you had been transported into the future on board the new $1 billion cruise ship Quantum of the Seas. As its name suggests, it is very much a quantum leap in boat building. The latest brainchild of Royal Caribbean, which has branded the newest member of its fleet the ""smartest cruise ship in history,"" it is basically a fun palace on the high seas. Everything, it seems, is a first: the first bumper cars, skydive simulator and bionic bar on a ship. And among the 19 restaurants on board, there is something for everyone. Those of a literary slant can even dine at Wonderland, with waitresses dressed up in characters from the novel by Lewis Carroll. Such are the maverick creations on board from bow to stern, it is a vessel befitting of the Mad Hatter. ""This is the smartest cruise ship,"" says Harri Kulovaara, executive vice-president of maritime at Royal Caribbean and head of the design process behind the project. ""This is probably going to be a big change for the industry and the future."" And this is not just Royal Caribbean's prediction. ""It's unique and unusual, and we just had fun -- pure and simple,"" is the assessment of Carolyn Spencer Brown, the editor of Cruise Critic, after spending eight days on Quantum. ""Royal Caribbean are always raising the bar when it comes to putting stuff on board you'd never thought you'd see on a cruise ship. ""They just do things well before anyone else and their ships are traditionally the ones you get most excited about,"" adds Spencer Brown, who estimates she has been on 300 cruises as part of her job. ""You keep on thinking when they come up with something crazy they've hit the wall and there can't be anything new, but there always is. They keep doing things no-one else has thought of."" There are bigger cruise ships out there: Allure and Oasis -- both part of the Royal Caribbean fleet -- although not quite with the same box of tricks. Kulovaara likes to think Quantum has something for everyone -- it even has its own ""godmother,"" American actress Kristin Chenoweth. But what exactly does a price tag of nearly $1 billion buy you? The vessel is 16 stories high, has room for 4,500 passengers and a 1,500-strong crew. It also boasts 18 decks, 2,090 state rooms, is the length of 41 London buses and weighs 167,800 tonnes. Built in Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany, its first voyage at the end of last year was from Southampton to New York, and an eight-day Caribbean cruise on board starts from $1,333. The project was first discussed in 2009 and the build took three and a half years. Finland-born Kulovaara, now based in Miami, takes great pride in the fact the vessel was delivered just two minutes late. Kulovaara, who has been with the company since 1995, is proud of the open-thinking mentality that appears to have gone into the design process. ""I don't remember any major elements that we did not get on the ship,"" he says. ""It's come together nicely. We have a group of people that love to innovate and look to the future. With this, we started to think about the next generation. ""When we start a new design, we think of the customer and what can we do. We put the customer right in there. How can we provide a better vacation? We constantly explore novel options, what's possible on a ship. We have people pushing innovation that just have that in their DNA."" That involves bringing partners on board, including the team behind RipCord by iFly -- provider of skydiving on the deck in an enclosed capsule -- which has long been a company aspiration. ""We've actively looked at having that on board before the technology was not enclosed and also too noisy,"" adds Kulovaara, who spent his childhood summers sailing in the Finnish Arctic. ""The technology moved on and the energy could be used in a constant loop so there wasn't such wasted energy."" It was the same for the North Star, a capsule -- modeled on the London Eye -- that gives holiday makers a 360-degree view of the deck but can also protrude over the side of the boat with just the sea below. It is not something for vertigo sufferers. ""North Star looks simple but it's very complex so adding to the ship design was huge,"" explains Kulovaara, who says he only got involved in studying naval architecture in order to make him a better yachtsman. ""Some of our best resources were working on that for 18 months before the product was started."" At the Bionic Bar, passengers can order drinks by iPad and watch as huge bionic arms make any beverage of their choosing. The tech thrills don't end there: Kulovaara claims Quantum has the most advanced WiFi on board any ship. He says the connectivity, set up by O3b, is as fast as logging on at home or at work -- achieved by using a satellite in much lower orbit than would normally be the case. ""It's comparable to anything on land, so this is a revolution."" The company is confident it is winning the cruise wars, and reviews of the vessel have, to date, been very positive. There are, however, rivals. Spencer Brown cites the examples of both Norwegian Cruise Line and Carnival for their own innovations. ""Norwegian has this completely nuts rope course on deck 16 with a gang plank which looks down over the sea. They were also the first for alternative restaurants and led the way with outdoor spaces and great party areas with bars and restaurants outside,"" she says. ""Carnival are doing some fun design work with Carnival Vista (launching in 2016). It's like a ship within a ship with a separate family zone and a Cuban-themed area for adults. ""So Royal Caribbean are leading the way but it's nice to see it's got competition."" There is a pressure on Royal Caribbean to raise the bar for its next creation, though Kulovaara is not concerned. ""This is about 1% great idea and 99% execution,"" he says. ""History tells us that we like to push the envelope and will continue to do that and create very unique experiences.""","Quantum of the Seas cost nearly $1 billion to build and is billed the world's smartest cruise ship .

"(CNN)It's the home of British politics, steeped in history, tradition and centuries-old pomp. But could the ornate splendor of the UK's Houses of Parliament be about to offer a solution to London's housing crisis? In all honesty, probably not. However, that hasn't stopped housing campaign group, Generation Rent, from proposing to transform the Palace of Westminster into affordable new homes. The group's eye-catching idea is to move the seat of British democracy from one of London's most exclusive neighborhoods to a new location in the city of Hull, northern England. The vacant House of Commons and House of Lords (the UK's upper legislative chamber) left behind would be converted into 364 flats of varying size and scale with prime office space facing the River Thames. According to a press release on the proposal from Generation Rent, 335 MPs from all over the UK currently rent second homes so they can carry out their parliamentary duties more effectively. They claim expenses for doing so cost the taxpayer £5.26 million ($8 million) in 2013 alone. By moving the seat of government to Hull, a city with the cheapest housing rent in England, millions could be saved in expenses as well as staffing costs, the group claims. Westminster is one of the most expensive boroughs for property in London, according to research from house moving firm, Delivery Quote Compare. The ever-rising cost of property in the UK capital, meanwhile, is making it increasingly difficult for many to buy or rent in central areas of the city. A January report from rental referencing company, Homelet, also found that average rental prices in Greater London were more than double that of those found in the rest of the UK . ""We hope our proposal gives MPs a sense of humility and some urgency to ending the housing crisis,"" said director of Generation Rent, Alex Hilton. Yet even if the Generation Rent proposals were seriously considered, they could come unstuck by the dilapidated state of the parliament building itself. Speaker of the House, John Bercow, said Monday that repairs needed to bring the nineteenth century structure up to scratch could come close to £3 billion ($4.6 billion). A 2012 study entitled ""The Restorations and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster"" found that the building could suffer permanent damage if work was not undertaken to stem leaks, repair crumbling stonework and remove asbestos.","UK campaign group proposes to transform Houses of Parliament into affordable housing units .

"(CNN)New York City public schools will now observe two Muslim holidays, officials announced Wednesday, making the district -- the nation's biggest -- one of the few to put Islamic holy days on its calendar. Under the change announced by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and city Schools Chancellor Carmen Farina, there will be no class for Eid al-Adha, also known as the Festival of Sacrifice, starting next September 24. Another Muslim holiday, Eid al-Fitr -- a festival marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan -- will become a holiday for those in summer school starting in 2016. ""This is a common-sense change,"" de Blasio said Wednesday, ""and one that recognizes our growing Muslim community and honors its contributions to our city."" The decision affects some 1 million students in New York City. While it's not known exactly how many of them are Muslim, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said that almost 1 million of the more than 8 million people in the city's five boroughs practice Islam and a 2009 Columbia University study found that roughly 10% of New York City public school students are Muslim. The move isn't a surprise, given de Blasio's campaign pledge to alter the school calendar with Muslim families in mind. ""Muslim students and their families who observe Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha shouldn't have to choose between an instructional day and their religious obligations,"" said Farina. ""This new addition will also enable a teachable moment in the classroom for our students to learn about religious tolerance and the societal contributions of various cultures."" Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York and the parent of three public school students, said a plan in which students wouldn't have to choose between education and faith ""a win for our children and for future generations in this country."" ""Muslims are a part of the fabric of this country,"" she said. ""We make our country proud, and today, New York City made us proud."" New York City joins school districts in other states, including New Jersey, Massachusetts and Vermont, that similarly observe Muslim holidays, according to a news release from Farina's office. And Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha join other religious holidays already on New York's public school calendar. In addition to holidays like Easter that always fall on a weekend, students already have Christian holidays such as Good Friday and Christmas off, as well as the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. CNN's Lorenzo Ferigno and Rob Frehse contributed to this report.","School chief: Muslim families shouldn't have to weigh school vs. religious observances .

"Washington  (CNN)Maryland authorities said Wednesday that a former state correctional officer has been arrested in connection with a recent spate of shootings, including one on the Intercounty Connector in Maryland and one at Fort Meade, where the National Security Agency office is located. Officers stopped Hong Young, 35, of Beltsville, Maryland, at around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday. The officers recognized Hong's vehicle -- a 1999 Lincoln Town Car -- as matching authorities' description of a car seen in surveillance footage near some of the shootings. A gun in the car matched evidence found at the shootings, authorities said at a press conference, and Young was arrested. Young is in the hospital and under police guard, though when reporters asked why he was being treated, officials would only say he was arrested without incident. He is charged with attempted first-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, weapons violations and reckless endangerment. Young worked as a correctional officer at a Jessup facility from 2012 until his resignation in 2014, Maryland Secretary of Public Safety Stephen Moyer said. There was nothing significant in his employee file, Moyer said. Police said that there are no links to terrorism, and no motive has been determined. No one was killed in the five shooting incidents, four of which occurred Monday and Tuesday, according to police reports. -- February 24 in Hanover, Maryland. a man who had stopped at a Costco said a man pulled up beside him in a Lincoln Town Car at 7:30 a.m. and began firing at him. The victim's vehicle was hit several times and the victim was grazed. The assailant drove away. -- March 2 in Laurel, Maryland. Police received a call at 2:50 a.m. that shots had been fired at a Walmart. There were no damages or injuries. -- March 2  in Columbia, Maryland. A call came in to law enforcement at 4:51 a.m.a bout shots fired at a movie theater at Columbia Mall. Surveillance footage captured a Lincoln Town Car at about the same time shots were fired, police said. Though several employees were there, no one was hurt, authorities said. There were bullet holes in the theater glass and a shell casing was found at the scene. -- March 3 in Prince George's County. Multiple shots were fired at an overpass on the InterCounty Connector in the afternoon, striking a tree service truck with two passengers inside. -- March 3 at Fort Meade. Shots struck a building near the NSA office at about 6 p.m. Along with the gun, evidence shows Young was the shooter in all but the Walmart incident, though that investigation is continuing, police said. Though no one was killed in the incidents, they stirred memories of the deadly Washington, D.C.-area sniper attacks in 2002. Ten people were killed in Washington, Maryland and Virginia during that rampage, which went on for three weeks.

"(CNN)CNN has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at UCLA never obtained permission to sell the device, according to an official at the Food and Drug Administration. Olympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA's Office of External Affairs. ""Why didn't we notice it? I don't know,"" Riley said. ""Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn't go through the approval process?"" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who's testified to Congress about device safety problems. ""Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing."" In a statement, Olympus said it didn't think needed the FDA's permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, ""out of an abundance of caution."" According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that ""could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device."" The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that's been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. ""The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn't safer,"" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA's request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn't want to take them off the market. ""More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,"" she said. ""We believe the benefits outweigh the risks."" In its statement, Olympus wrote: ""The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community.  Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures]."" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus' TJF-Q180V. Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it's not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA's standard for disinfection. ""We're still working with them to get good data,"" she said. Riley said she doesn't know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should. ""It's like with kids. How do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave?"" she said.","FDA official says Olympus never got permission to sell its endoscope .

"(CNN)There seems to be an ever-growing list of people, places and things that will turn you gay. Maybe we should think of these as the brigade of evil, homosexual nouns. There were the Teletubbies and SpongeBob SquarePants a decade ago. Now, as these views thankfully get more fringe, the theories are becoming increasingly bizarre and awesome. Among the homo nouns, there's the Common Core, according to a Florida lawmaker (education policy is super gay, obviously); Taylor Swift, who an op-ed writer for The Christian Post, Larry Tomczak, claims is being used by Ellen DeGeneres to ""attract young girls"" to her show (uh-huh); the Disney princess movie ""Frozen,"" according to radio hosts in Colorado (that dress!); and now, according to a potential 2016 Republican presidential contender, Ben Carson, there's prison. Yep, prison. Stay away from crime, kids. Turns ya gay. Carson, who, let me reiterate, is a potential presidential candidate from a major American party, and a neurosurgeon to boot, told CNN's Chris Cuomo in an interview that aired Wednesday that ""a lot of people ... go into prison straight -- and when they come out, they're gay."" Asked if being gay was a choice, Carson replied in a word: ""Absolutely."" This level of ignorance is so last century, so near-irrelevant, that I'm hesitant even to respond. But no one who holds these beliefs belongs in a race for the 2016 White House. Ordinarily, I'm the kind of gay person who likes to give people room to evolve. I know not everyone ""gets it"" automatically. That's OK, as long as you aren't hateful about it, are willing to listen and don't try to restrict the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. I'm from Oklahoma, a deeply conservative state, and I've seen friends, family and co-workers evolve. People who thought being gay was a sin -- or that it was a choice, or fixable -- now support same-sex marriage. People change. But presidential candidates don't get that leeway. Carson should know better. (In fact, he later apologized, regretting his words but saying the science on the issue of sexual orientation isn't clear.) These views belong in another decade, not modern America. This apparently still needs to be said: Being gay is not a choice. Don't believe me? Well, ask a gay person. As I mentioned, I'm one of those (despite never having seen ""Frozen"" in its entirety), and I can tell you that, for me, it wasn't a choice. It's not something I would want to undo, but it also isn't like I woke up one day and was like, huh, you know what would really mix it up this winter? Dating dudes instead of ladies. Science backs me on this. I'm not going to roll through all the details, but Mark Joseph Stern from Slate sums it up pretty well: ""In study after study, biologists have found that homosexuality, at least in men, is clearly, undoubtedly, inarguably an inborn trait."" And even if it were a choice, who cares? A person's religion is a choice. Yet the United States offers certain protections based on religion. People still deserve rights. Carson, meanwhile, opposes same-sex marriage. That's a stance that, again, thankfully, is getting exceedingly rare in national politics. It's also an issue that, along with transgender rights and employment discrimination against LGBT people, should be a focal point in the 2016 campaign cycle. I hope that America is evolved enough not to elect a candidate who opposes LGBT rights. I do think we live in that country these days. It's a country that mostly laughs at someone saying prison would ""turn"" someone gay. But the point remains that saying so both belittles a serious issue of violence -- that of men raping other men in prison, which has nothing to do with turning anyone gay and everything to do with criminal activity. And it's a serious lapse in logic. Being around a bunch of dudes -- or ladies -- in prison doesn't change a person's innate sexual attractions. It's so obvious I shouldn't have to say it.

"(CNN)Wednesday's terrorist attack, which killed 23 people, hit Tunisia where it hurt by targeting its flourishing tourism industry. The deadly attack on the prominent Bardo Museum near Tunisia's parliament in the country's capital, Tunis, is the latest instance of an armed assault carried out by gunmen willing to fight to the death, a tactic that has been widely adopted by jihadist terrorists in recent years, including in North Africa. Such attacks mimic the 2008 Mumbai assaults in which 10 gunmen from Pakistan went on a rampage in the massive Indian port city. They took hostages and killed more than 160 people over a three-day period, in an attack that drew  sustained global TV coverage. The gunmen attacked iconic Mumbai targets such as the Taj hotel, which is frequented by Westerners. The Mumbai gunmen embarked on their attack knowing that it was a ""fedayeen"" mission -- meaning ""those who sacrifice themselves"" -- and that they would probably fight to the death. Only one gunman survived. In this week's Tunisia attack, the gunmen took hostages, two gunmen died in the assault, and three survived and are being hunted by the Tunisian government. Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid said the attackers at the Bardo Museum had specifically targeted tourists to hurt the country's economy. This seems a likely outcome of the attack, as tourism is vital to Tunisia's economy, providing 15% of GDP. Tunisia is also the only country where the Arab Spring produced a successful, lasting democratic transition, making it attractive to tourists who are avoiding going to countries like Egypt, which did not weather the Arab Spring as well as Tunisia. Already, some tour companies are canceling excursions to Tunis. In January, in Tunisia's neighbor Libya, the local branch of ISIS mounted a similar attack on the upscale Corinthia Hotel in the capital, Tripoli. Two gunmen, one of them a Tunisian, killed 10 people, including an American. Both gunmen died in the attack. This attack served ISIS' purposes of sowing greater instability in Libya and expunging Western influence from the country, as the hotel was where many foreign businessmen stayed. A senior US official told one of us that the U.S. intelligence community estimates that jihadist terrorist groups such as ISIS now control a twelfth of the landmass of Libya, which is one of the largest countries on the African continent. This is a sobering finding for Tunisia, which had been largely immune from the kinds of terrorist attacks that have recently plagued Libya and other North African countries. While the museum attack in Tunisia and the hotel attack in Libya may help terrorist groups to achieve their strategic goals, more often than not, armed assaults by terrorists against so-called soft targets such as hotels, supermarkets and malls do not achieve much beyond the tactical successes of global news coverage and causing mayhem. In September 2013, Al-Shabaab, the Somali al Qaeda affiliate, killed 67 people in a fedayeen-style armed assault on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya. Four gunmen carried out the attack, which unspooled over a four-day period. The Westgate attack received much global news coverage and was designed to put pressure on the Kenyan government, which had sent troops to Somalia to fight Al-Shabaab. However, a year and a half after the attack on the mall, Al-Shabaab continues to lose territory in Somalia, and the Kenyan military has continued to battle the terrorist group. The plague of Mumbai-style armed assaults by jihadist terrorists is not confined to Africa. In January, Mumbai-style tactics were used in Paris when Cherif and Said Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly conducted armed assaults on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket over a three-day period. All three gunmen were killed. In a videotape, Coulibaly said ISIS inspired him. The Paris attacks received considerable coverage around the world but had no impact on France's willingness to continue its involvement in coalition airstrikes against ISIS.","Tunisia weathered the Arab Spring and has been buoyed by its tourism industry .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN)Jaquita Gonzales still tries to call her husband on his cellphone. A pair of work shoes still sits outside the front door of their home in Kuala Lumpur waiting to be reclaimed. His uniform still hangs in a cupboard. Twelve months after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished without a trace, Gonzales hasn't given up hope. She can't. Neither can her children, other family members and friends. Not until there is some conclusive evidence on the fate of the airliner -- one way or another. ""Now and then, every once in a while I call his phone and it goes to voicemail,"" she says. ""You never know, he might pick it up, or someone who has them would let them have the phone and you know, the hope is still there."" She's not alone. Families of victims we spoke to hold on to the slimmest belief that MH370, which disappeared barely an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 last year, did not crash and that the 239 passengers and crew on board are alive. ""No evidence means there is still a little bit of hope. We tap into that hope in order to go on day by day,"" says Gonzales. But she lives a life in limbo. Neither able to move on, nor go back. Her comfortable home in the suburbs of Malaysia's capital remains virtually the same since her husband of nearly 30 years, Patrick Gomes, left for work on the evening of March 7 as lead purser on the MH370 red-eye bound for the Chinese capital. The only real sign that time has moved on, amid the family photos and plaques celebrating her husband's work achievements is a newspaper on top of a stack in the living room with the word ""LOST"" splashed across its front page. Gonzales' lifeline, apart from family, is her work. She runs a private school and daycare center for about 70 children and spends about 12 hours a day there. Keeping busy, she says, keeps her sane. But not a day goes by without her thinking of Patrick. ""I can be driving and I just have to pull off the road and weep. Everywhere I go I see Patrick,"" she says. ""In our home, with my children, with our friends. There are so many times around the home when I say Patrick you are supposed to be doing this for me, where are you. He helped me with ironing, with cooking."" Like Gonzales, many other families CNN has spoken to say they live in hope that their loved one are still alive even though it seems now a virtual impossibility. But along with hope and the pain, many families also share a deep anger. Anger at the Malaysian authorities and Malaysia Airlines who, Gonzales says, are ignoring them. Requests for information are unanswered and attempts to talk to key officials are rebuffed, she says. Grace Nathan's mother was on MH370. For almost a year she and her family grieved in private. But now she has gone public after what she describes as the Malaysian authorities continued ""mishandling"" of the disappearance. ""There is a lack of transparency, a lack of communications between us and the relevant authorities,' she says. ""Whenever we've written to them or asked them for answers they have never replied. ""It's not like they haven't learned. I would put it that they just don't care. They just want to move on. They don't really care about what we feel or what we have to say."" One recent decision by Malaysian authorities has caused bitter resentment among many families. In late January, the government televised a pre-recorded announcement from the civil aviation chief that the passengers and crew of MH370 were ""presumed lost"" after the plane crashed as a result of an accident. Families were not been given any advance warning of the announcement and, even though it clears the way for compensation claims, they say there is just no evidence to support the statement. It also came just before Chinese New Year, a time of celebration. More than 150 passengers on the flight were Chinese nationals. To add insult to injury, families say, the government had planned to make the announcement at a press conference but canceled the briefing when next-of-kin rushed to the venue. Nathan says she only heard that the government was planning to make the statement when local media rang her. ""They rang to say 'can we come and record your reaction when this declaration is made?' Our reaction was 'what declaration?' We didn't know anything about it. ""I haven't spoken to the media at all since the accident happened but after that treatment I decided it was time that we said something. It was a group decision that we speak to the media because (the authorities) never respond to anything we write to them or ask them about,"" she adds. CNN contacted both the Malaysian Government and Malaysia Airlines for a response to the families' claims, but did not receive an answer. For relatives like Gonzales and Nathan, each day is a struggle, a struggle to stop being overwhelmed by memories. ""I am just going through the motions,' says Grace. ""I am dead inside, I have stopped being happy. Every day basically I just force myself to get through the day.""","Jaquita Gonzales' husband was a member of the cabin crew on board MH370 .

"(CNN)A man who says he's Mohammed Emwazi's father has reportedly said there is no proof that his son is the masked ISIS killer known as ""Jihadi John."" ""There is nothing that proves what is being circulated in the media, especially through video clips and footage, that the accused is my son Mohammed, who is being referred to as the alleged executioner"" of ISIS, Jassem Emwazi told the Kuwaiti newspaper al Qabas. Jassem Emwazi said there are only ""false rumors"" circulating about his son. The elder Emwazi told the newspaper he has hired an attorney. The lawyer, Kuwait-based Salem Al-Hashash, told CNN on Tuesday that he was representing Jassem Emwazi and planned to file lawsuits against anyone who has claimed that Mohammed Emwazi is Jihadi John. The lawyer called the father a ""victim of libel"" and said that he would soon hold a news conference. Last week, two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed to CNN that ""Jihadi John"" is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. Jassem Emwazi's statements to al Qabas appear to contradict reports this week that his wife recognized Jihadi John's voice as her son's when she saw footage that shows the man, whose face is covered, brandishing a knife and threatening ISIS hostages. Emwazi told British newspaper The Guardian that the stories about the couple recognizing the voice were false. ""Lie, lie, lie,"" he reportedly said. Mohammed Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988 and moved to the United Kingdom with his parents and sister when he was six, according to CAGE, an advocacy group for people suspected of involvement in terrorism. CAGE interacted with Emwazi before he joined the terror group, a member has said. CAGE released a recording last week that it said it taped of Mohammed Emwazi in 2009. In that recording, Emwazi is heard talking about been questioned by British intelligence service regarding a July 2005 terror attack in London.

"Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's attorney made one thing clear during her opening statement in the Boston Marathon bombing trial: He did it. ""It was him,"" defense attorney Judy Clarke told jurors. Tsarnaev carried one of the pressure cooker bombs on April 15, 2013, and placed it near the finish line, she said. He was there when a police officer was killed. He was involved in a shootout with police. The accused bomber will not sidestep any of his actions, Clarke said. So, why even a trial at all? Because there's disagreement over why Tsarnaev did it, Clarke said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was influenced by his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Clarke said. He was enlisted by his brother to commit these horrific acts, she said. The first day of the trial provided jurors with a peek at the strategies of the prosecution and defense. Based on their opening statements, both sides agree on the basic facts around the attacks -- who carried them out and how. But both sides presented divergent views of why Dzhokhar Tsarnaev carried out the attacks. The goal of the Tsarnaev brothers was to kill as many people as possible, U.S. prosecutor Bill Weinreb said during his initial statement to jurors. The prosecutor described in detail the deaths of three victims near the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon and painted a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as a holy warrior committed to violence. More than 260 others were maimed or injured by two pressure cooker bombs that exploded within 12 seconds of each other. A fourth person, an MIT police officer, was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, allegedly ran from police. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed after a gunbattle with police. So it is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev who is on trial, charged with 30 counts related to the bombings. Weinreb said Tsarnaev's actions after the bombings -- going to Whole Foods to buy a gallon of milk, hanging out with friends -- show that he didn't care about what he did. To the contrary, the prosecutor told jurors, he believed he had done good. The motive for the attacks can be found in the boat that ultimately became Tsarnaev's hideout before his arrest, he said. There, Tsarnaev allegedly wrote messages explaining that he believed the U.S. government is an enemy of Islam. Boston Marathon bombing timeline . Tsarnaev listened to jihadist lectures and songs, and had an online presence in which he espoused a radical view of Islam, Weinreb said. He had a collection of magazines published by al Qaeda, one with instructions for building the same type of bomb used in the Boston Marathon attack, he said. The defense pinned the radicalization on Tamerlan. Clarke showed two side-by-side photos in court: One of the brothers smiling, and one of them carrying backpacks linked to the attacks. The attacks were ""incomprehensible, they're inexcusable,"" she said, but also asked, who turned Tsarnaev from the smiling kid into a bomber? It was Tamerlan who self-radicalized, and Tamerlan who influenced his brother to follow him, she argued. At the outset of the trial, Weinreb spoke in detail to the jury about the lives ended by the pair of bombs at the marathon. Martin Richard, an 8-year-old spectator, was standing with his family cheering runners on when the second bomb exploded just feet away. Martin was only 4 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 70 pounds, the prosecutor said. The bomb blew large holes into the boy's chest and organs -- ""tore large chunks of flesh out of Martin's body,"" Weinreb said. The boy died. The first witness the prosecution called Wednesday was Thomas Grilk, executive director of the Boston Athletic Association. Grilk provided some facts about the marathon, but Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty also asked him to talk about the day of the bombings. The prosecution played videos of the first explosion, then the second, showing people scrambling in the aftermath. Grilk let out a long sigh as one of the videos was paused. ""Every day you walk outside, you are in that area,"" testified Shane O'Hara, the manager at Marathon Sports, a running store close to where the bombs went off. He was emotional as he vividly recounted what sounded to him like a loud cannon, and the instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows. O'Hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair, and cries for help. The decisions about who to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunt him, he said. There were cries, sirens and screams, he said in answer to prosecutors' questions. He sniffled as a photo of the blown-out storefront was shown in the court. He told the jury the plea he heard from one of the injured: ""Stay with me, stay with me."" Wednesday's testimony centered on the stories of the survivors. Tsarnaev's lawyers opted not to cross-examine any of the witnesses who testified to what they lived through that day. Colton Kilgore and Rebekah Gregory were part of a large group who were present to cheer on a family member. Kilgore took the witness stand and described the videos he shot after the blasts. It was an instinct to record the scene, he said. ""I was blown through the air. There was a deafening explosion,"" he said. He saw bodies and faces also tumble through the air. His videos captured the chaos, the cries for help, people using any material they could find to help perform first aid. At one point, Kilgore recalled, he sat on something hot, only to realize he was sitting on pieces of burning metal and shards. Gregory testified that she was watching the race, but also looking after her 5-year-old, Noah, who was a bit bored. After the blast, she couldn't feel her legs. ""My bones were literally laying next to me on the sidewalk,"" she said. ""At that point I thought that was the day I would die."" Her first instinct was for Noah's safety. She asked God to take her if she was indeed dying, but to let her know that Noah was OK. Somehow, she said, despite the confusion and her pain, she could hear his voice calling her. Noah was injured. Gregory now wears a prosthesis. Sydney Corcoran was a high school senior on the day of the bombings. Her testimony centered on her near certainty that she would die that day. She passed out and awoke to a group of men attending to her, putting pressure on her leg, trying to find where she was bleeding. One man put his forehead on her head and told her she would be OK. But then, another man said he could see her eyes were going white, she testified. ""I could feel my body going tingly and I was getting increasingly cold. I knew I was dying,"" she told the jury. It took nearly two months of juror interviews -- 256 people over 22 court days -- to select the jury in the bombing trial. The group includes 18 people from across the socioeconomic spectrum, but the group is almost exclusively white. Race has been an issue raised by Tsarnaev's defense during four unsuccessful attempts to move the death penalty trial from Boston. His attorneys argued that the way the court issues jury summons led to picking a panel that's older and whiter than the community at large. But prosecutors argued that the jury had been picked properly. ""The prosecution got exactly what they wanted,"" said CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos, a criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles. Middle-aged white jurors tend to be more likely to support death penalty verdicts, he said. ""It's a target demographic for a death penalty jury."" Just one juror seemed to combine youth and ethnic diversity. A college student who is taking a break from his studies, he said his mother was born in Iran and converted from Islam to the  Baha'i faith. The Slip Away, a boat in which Tsarnaev sought cover after the police gunbattle, also is expected to be a key piece of evidence. The prosecution is seeking to remove a panel on which Tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so jurors can see it. Weinreb has said the boat is too large to bring into the courthouse. The defense, however, wants the jury to see the entire boat, complete with bullet holes. Defense attorney David Bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and wouldn't fairly reflect Tsarnaev's state of mind. Court papers have already given the public a glimpse of several statements Tsarnaev allegedly wrote inside the boat: . ""The U.S. government is killing our innocent civilians,"" he allegedly wrote. ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished."" ""We Muslims are one body. You hurt one, you hurt us all."" ""Now I don't like killing innocent people. It is forbidden in Islam but due to said (unintelligible) it is allowed."" ""Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.""

"Los Angeles (CNN)Federal agents on Tuesday raided more than three dozen ""maternity hotels"" in Southern California where foreign women give birth, allegedly for the sole purpose of having a U.S.-citizen baby, authorities said. The ""maternity tourism"" sites included apartment complexes in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth, federal officials said. Those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from China, who paid $15,000 to $50,000 for lodging, transportation and food, according to a statement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Those fees don't necessarily include medical care, authorities said. Authorities are looking for evidence of bringing in and harboring of undocumented visitors; conspiracy, fraud and misuse of visas and permits; tax evasion and false tax returns; and willful failure to file report of foreign bank and financial accounts, court papers said. ""Based on the results of the investigations to date, it appears the women pay cash for prenatal visits and the actual delivery,"" U.S. authorities said. ""As part of the package, clients were promised they would receive Social Security numbers and U.S. passports for their infants, which the mothers would take with them when they left the U.S."" Some of the packages included recreational trips to Disneyland, shopping malls and even to a firing range, authorities said. ""Any women encountered at the search locations will be interviewed and those identified as potential material witnesses will be directed when and where to report for further questioning,"" authorities said Tuesday. Investigators weren't expected Tuesday to comment further on the outcome of the raids, said ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice. In all, authorities obtained warrants for 37 locations and ended up searching more than 50 sites, including consensual searches, Kice said. The purported tourism businesses promoted themselves on the Internet and through social media, authorities said. One firm in Rancho Cucamonga, California, advertised in Chinese and branded itself as ""You Win USA Vacation Resort."" Operators of that firm couldn't be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. Chinese women have been flocking to the United States to give birth, lured because the country grants American citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, CNN Money reported last month. That CNN Money account was cited in an affidavit filed Monday in a federal California court by Homeland Security Investigation agent Eric Blair, who asked a judge for a warrant to search Rancho Cucamonga apartment buildings for large sums of cash and evidence of contraband and a crime. The judge granted the warrant. Read one affidavit . ""Perpetrators of visa fraud schemes typically charge $40,000 to $60,000, which is a fee able to be paid by the wealthy in China,"" Blair stated in court papers. In 2012, about 10,000 Chinese women gave birth in the United States, more than double the 4,200 in 2008, according to Chinese state media. Blair alleged that the birthing houses ""will generally advise foreign national clients to fly to tourism points of entry such as Hawaii or Las Vegas and to avoid traveling directly to Los Angeles International Airport. This advice is due to heightened security by (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) officials at LAX based on the volume of fraudulent visas and false statements and entry documents that CPB officials have experienced over the last decade related to birth tourism."" One operator of the alleged maternity tourism schemes in California was providing bank statements claiming he had monthly gross receipts of $213,968.79 and an annual income of $1,283,812.74, Blair said in court papers. Those bank statements were provided by an Internal Revenue Service special agent, Blair said. Many of the families want an American child because a foreign passport could be the family's ticket out of China if they grow weary of pollution or food safety scares. President Xi Jinping's widespread anti-corruption campaign has given rich Chinese yet another reason to be on edge. ""If things become economically or politically uncertain in one's country of origin, the children have a place to come to,"" Leti Volpp, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN Money last month. The children can ""then sponsor their parents when they turn 21,"" Volpp said. The desire to leave China is especially pronounced among the wealthy. Almost two-thirds of Chinese with more than 10 million yuan ($1.6 million) in the bank have emigrated, or are planning to, according to a Hurun report released last year. One advertisement for a Hacienda Heights location ""claims that the apartments are extremely suitable for expectant mothers and their accompanying families,"" Blair said in court documents. ""The apartment will allow expectant mothers to experience the American lifestyle during their stay."" In an interview with CNN Money in February, Felicia He, 27, said she paid tens of thousands of dollars to give birth in California. That interview occurred well before Tuesday's federal announcement of raids. ""I started getting ready for the trip around the end of my first trimester,"" He said. ""I asked my friends who have given birth before in the U.S. for a doctor recommendation; then I found a place to stay in the area for a few months, and purchased my plane ticket."" He, who gave birth last year, said a U.S. passport for her baby means access to better education opportunities. Foreign status opens the door to exclusive international schools in Beijing, where she lives with her husband, and the option for the child to study abroad for high school and college. There is one catch, though. Getting a U.S. passport for a baby means the child will eventually be responsible for U.S. taxes.

"(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the Congress this week was as eagerly anticipated in Tehran as it was in Washington. The Iranian reaction to the speech has been a combination of indignation and indifference. While some of Netanyahu's remarks are already being exploited by competing factions within the Iranian state, the likeliest impact of the speech is tied to Netanyahu's baseless charge that Iran's vendetta against the Jewish people is an ancient mission. The earliest official reactions were predictably the most vigorous in denouncing Netanyahu's message to the American people. Ali Larijani, the powerful speaker of the Iranian parliament, painted Netanyahu as the leader of a ""tin pot regime"" that is not as concerned about Iran's nuclear program as it is of Tehran's growing regional influence. The hardline Kayhan newspaper, the key official outlet linked to the office of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the speech ""trash talking"" but it also made sure to use it an ammunition against its rivals in the moderate faction. The paper, skeptical of President Hassan Rouhani's nuclear negotiations with the Americans from the beginning, said Netanyahu's comments present an awkward truth for the pro-negotiation faction in Tehran: the Israeli leader and his American supporters are openly signaling the dispute with Iran can only be resolved once there is a change of regime there. Iranian media coverage of Netanyahu's speech mentioned the controversy in the U.S. around its timing but the hardline outlets warned against reading too much into it. As one hardline newspaper, Khorasan, put it, ""although it is undeniable that Obama and Netanyahu disagree on Iran, the [recent] remarks of the two [leaders] shows that they both seek the same goal."" The idea that the U.S. and Israel share the same strategic goal to rein in Iran but are in disagreement about how to achieve it is the cornerstone of the hardliners' stance in Tehran. The moderate outlets, supportive of President Rouhani, have put a different spin on Netanyahu's speech. Unlike the hardliners, they are not painting the Obama-Netanyahu fallout as some orchestrated good cop-bad cop ploy to maximize concessions from Tehran. Instead, they emphasize that there is a genuine difference in opinion between the U.S. and Israel. The moderate faction sees the controversy around Netanyahu's speech to the Congress and his failure to squeeze the Obama White House to toughen its negotiation terms with Tehran as an indication that Netanyahu is the one who is isolated. The hardliners and the moderates were in full agreement on one point, and that was the delight they shared about the absence of some 60 out of 232 Democratic members of the Congress from Netanyahu's speech. It is too early to gain a good insight into the reaction of ordinary Iranians to Netanyahu's speech. But one aspect of his speech is bound to create backlash among ordinary Iranians outside the corridors of the state: his invocation of festival of Purim, which commemorates the salvation of Jewish people in ancient Persia. The historic event is recorded in the Book of Esther but Netanyahu's characterization implied that the Persian people's history of anti-Semitism and the pursuit of agenda to destroy the Jewish people is an ancient mission. ""Today the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us,"" Netanyahu said. With that line, he put the ruling Islamists in Tehran on par with ruling Persian empires that have come before them. As is already evident in the Persian-language social media, this will not go down well with ordinary Iranians, many of whom are not supporters of the Islamist system in Tehran and will resent the charge of eternal Persian anti-Semitism. They wish Netanyahu had made more effort to distinguish between the Islamist rulers in Tehran -- many of whom undoubtedly harbor anti-Semitic views -- and the people of Iran whose history with the Jewish nation is far more amicable than Netanyahu's portrayal of history suggests. What is more instantly measurable is the impact of Netanyahu's speech among officials in Tehran. The Iranian response to Netanyahu's speech to the Congress is best described as one that reflects the clash of visions between moderates and hardliners in the echelons of power. For the moderates, the controversy around his speech and the cold-shoulder Netanyahu got from the White House is itself a vindication of President Rouhani's gamble on reaching a diplomatic solution to Iran's 12-year nuclear saga. The hardliners have been quick to paint Netanyahu's visit to Washington as an example of the insincerity of the Americans in dealing with Iran, but not even the hawks in Tehran are claiming that Netanyahu's presence in the U.S. Congress is grounds to shift Iran's nuclear diplomatic strategy.","Iranians met Netanyahu's speech with indignation, indifference, writes Alex Vatanka .

"(CNN)A runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport reopened Friday morning, a day after a Delta Air Lines plane skidded off it before halting near the icy waters of Flushing Bay. Runway 13 remained closed until the plane could be removed and brought into a hangar. It reopened at 10:30 a.m. ET Friday, according to Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Delta plane slid off the runway Thursday morning, with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters. Delta Flight 1086 briefly circled New York due to issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. Thursday, passenger Jared Faellaci told CNN. Almost as soon as it did, those aboard realized something was wrong -- the aircraft's wheels seemed to have little to no traction, sliding for about 20 seconds. ""You didn't feel the wheels take,"" Faellaci said. Then it was a matter of ""where we are going to end up,"" he said. About 4,500 to 5,000 feet down Runway 13, the MD-88 veered to the left and mercifully stopped on a small embankment. A little farther, and the plane -- with 127 passengers and five crew members -- would have been in Flushing Bay rather than on the airport's snow-covered ground. Contrary to what Delta said in a statement, the aircraft's slides did not deploy, according to Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye. Still, with help from first responders, everyone was able to get off and onto buses that took them to LaGuardia's Delta terminal. Video showed passengers exiting the plane into the subfreezing temperatures as emergency vehicles converged on the area. Twenty-four people suffered injuries that were non-life threatening. Three of those were transported to nearby hospitals, the New York City Fire Department tweeted. Faellaci said he was thankful for the plane's crew, first responders and God that it wasn't much worse. ""It was cause for a moment of prayer and a moment of reflection, as people were scared,"" he said. ""The pilot did a phenomenal job."" The plane left a relatively balmy Atlanta shortly after 9 a.m. LaGuardia was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later. Before touching down, the plane's pilot said weather problems could cause a delay. Still, little prepared passengers for what happened. Faellaci said he was reminded of the U.S. Airways plane that landed in the Hudson River in 2009. All 155 people aboard that flight -- heading from LaGuardia to Charlotte, North Carolina -- famously survived thanks to the skills of pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger. The landing of Delta Flight 1086 was terrifying for many. ""There were people that were calm, there were people that were praying, there were people that obviously were frantic, there were people that were crying,"" Faellaci said.

"(CNN)The attack on Mark Lippert, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, allegedly by a knife-wielding Korean progressive activist at a breakfast meeting in Seoul, was a rare and shocking reminder of the ongoing conflict that continues to divide the Korean Peninsula. Despite the ever-present backdrop of inter-Korean tensions, security in downtown Seoul is typically quite relaxed. But on Thursday morning local time, the alleged assailant, who has been tied to Korean nationalist and anti-U.S. protests, reportedly shouted his opposition to annual U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises and called for Korean reunification as he cut the ambassador on the face and hand with a 10-inch knife. This breakfast meeting with Lippert was taking place at a building directly across the street from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.  And the scene was probably not too different from a similar breakfast meeting I attended with the ambassador at a downtown hotel only a week before the attack. Lippert moved freely without a security detail or security screenings at the entrance to the venue, and was accompanied by only one or two embassy staff.  Indeed, even since 9/11, it is relatively easy to enter most large buildings in downtown Seoul, and security procedures have been generally perfunctory. In part this is because direct confrontations between South Korean citizens and U.S. government representatives in South Korea have been rare, and violent political attacks are unusual. True, there have been periodic group protests against the U.S. military presence in South Korea or against U.S. policy. But these protests have generally been conducted peacefully, a far cry from the environment of the 1980s, when pro-democracy protesters against a then-authoritarian South Korean government attacked and burned U.S. government facilities. Yet although downtown Seoul has been relatively safe and public security has often been lax, violent attacks on public figures in South Korea are in fact not unprecedented. The attack on Lippert brings to mind a May 2006 attack by a knife-wielding assailant on Park Geun-hye, South Korea's current President, while she was campaigning in local elections in Daejeon. (Her calm demeanor despite receiving a facial laceration contributed to her reputation as a politician and future President who is cool in the midst of a crisis.) The attack on Park wasn't the only time the dangers inherent in South Korea's lax security environment  have been exposed: Back in 2008, a lone arsonist burned to the ground Seoul's unguarded Namdaemun, or South Gate, a South Korean cultural treasure. And of course, there is the backdrop of the ongoing inter-Korean confrontation, which plays out within Korean democracy in the form of a bitter confrontation between progressive and conservative factions.  There is speculation that some members of South Korea's progressive movement have ties with North Korea, and some of them have allegedly been somewhat willing to foment violence to stir up conflict within South Korean society. Most recently, some members of South Korea's left-leaning United Progressive Party, which had won seats in South Korea's National Assembly, were disbarred and convicted of plotting a violent insurrection, leading to the dissolution of the party itself. And while this hard-core group represents a fringe element within South Korean society, it still remains active in part due to North Korean ideological and financial support. All this said, the overwhelming initial Korean public response to the attack on Lippert has been one of outrage, condemnation and sympathy. Indeed, far from revealing gaps in the U.S.-South Korea alliance or fomenting discord over whether joint military exercises should move forward, the incident is likely to strengthen South Korean feelings of support for the alliance with the United States. Still, the incident also serves as a reminder that even in the most seemingly safe and pro-American environments around the world, there is a risk that some zealous critics of U.S. policy may resort to violence against official U.S. representatives overseas. And that's especially so in regions such as the Korean Peninsula, where longstanding tensions still cast a shadow over security considerations.","Mark Lippert, U.S. ambassador to South Korea, was attacked in Seoul .

"(CNN)Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen says he has found the wreck of a long-lost World War II Japanese battleship near the Philippines. The philanthropist posted images on Twitter that appeared to show the Musashi, once one of the two largest warships in the world. The discovery was made aboard his superyacht, the MY Octopus, as part of an expedition that Allen launched. The search has taken Allen and his team of researchers more than eight years. The images and video were taken by an unmanned submersible deployed from the vessel. ""Since my youth, I have been fascinated with World War II history, inspired by my father's service in the U.S. Army,"" Allen said in a statement. ""The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel and, as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction. I am honored to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honoring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her."" He used his Twitter account to publicize the find. In one tweet, he said one image showed the bow of the ship, which features a distinctive chrysanthemum -- the flower is the emblem of Japan's royal family -- and a huge anchor. The other underwater photograph shows one of the Musashi's valves on which the Japanese characters for ""main valve handle"" and ""open"" are legible. He said the writing on the valve was proof that the ship was of Japanese origin. The director of Japan's Kure Maritime Museum told CNN after viewing the information posted by Allen that it appeared that the vessel was the Musashi, although further pictures were needed to know for sure. The Musashi was one of two Yamato-class battleships constructed by the Imperial Japanese Navy. Launched in 1940, it was, at the time, the largest class of warship ever constructed, displacing more than 69,000 tons. The Musashi sank on October 24, 1944, during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, in the central Philippines. According to U.S. Navy documents, torpedo planes from U.S. aircraft carriers scored at least 10 hits on the battleship over the course of four hours. Navy dive bombers also hit the ship 16 times, but it was the torpedo hits that doomed the Musashi. ""She went down by the bow, capsizing when the forward flying (U.S. forecastle) deck was submerged,"" said the Navy report, based on survivor accounts. Two of those survivors, the executive officer and the chief engineer, told how they escaped the sinking. ""The executive officer swam off from one of the upper levels in the tower. He saw the propellers as Musashi disappeared,"" the Navy report said. ""The chief engineer climbed over the side amidships as Musashi lurched to port. He walked and scrambled around the girth against the roll, climbing over the bilge keel. Finally, he was thrown off into the water and swam away to port. There were no explosions."" More than 1,000 of the Musashi's crew were killed during the battle and sinking. The 1,300-plus survivors were taken aboard by other Japanese warships, according to the U.S. Navy report. Allen said that his superyacht, the MY Octopus, had found the wreck at a depth of around 1 kilometer (3,281 feet). A statement released by Vulcan, Allen's company, said that the team combined historical data with advanced technology to narrow the search area, and that Allen had ""commissioned a hypsometric bathymetric survey of the ocean floor to determine the terrain"" before searching the area with a Bluefin autonomous underwater vehicle. Kazushige Todaka, the maritime museum director, said that, given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found, he was ""90% sure"" that the ship was the Musashi. ""I was really surprised because the location of the sunken ship has never been identified since it went down. I have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered, but they all turned out not to be true."" Todaka said Allen's team had been in contact with the museum about the ship's potential location and its expedition. ""It's a wonderful discovery, if it's true, as we have long been looking for the battleship,"" he said. ""It's fateful that the discovery was made on the 70th anniversary of (the end of) World War II. The memory of the war has been fading away after 70 years, and the survivors of the war are disappearing. It is very meaningful discovery and a good chance for us to remind ourselves about the war and its tragedy."" He added that images of the entire body of the ship will be needed to be 100% sure that the discovery is indeed the Musashi. The Vulcan statement added that the team is ""mindful of the responsibility related to the wreckage of the Musashi as a war grave and intend to work with the Japanese government to ensure the site is treated respectfully and in accordance with Japanese traditions."" Since leaving Microsoft, the company he co-founded in 1975, billionaire Allen has immersed himself in a variety of commercial and charitable pursuits. He is the owner of several U.S. sports teams -- including the Seattle Seahawks -- and backed SpaceShipOne, the prototype commercial spaceplane that won the 2004 Ansari X Prize. His estimated net worth is $17.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine. CNN's Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","Japan's Musashi was once one of the two largest warships in the world .

"Omaha, Nebraska (the Heartland Project)When Ryan Sallans, an activist in the Nebraska transgender community, first went to the doctor in 2005 to talk about what he medically needed to do for his gender transition, his doctor wanted to offer medical help. That was the good news. The disconcerting news was the doctor had to Google the issue first to figure out the best medical advice. ""My provider just did a Web search to figure out what dose of hormones I should be on, and put me on the highest dose,"" Sallans said.  That could have been a dangerous choice. ""Starting too high of a dose too quickly can cause a lot of health problems, particularly to cardiovascular health."" Fortunately, Sallans didn't have any health complications. But his experience left him with a mission. He volunteers to speak with medical institutions, as well as with businesses and colleges, to urge them to be more LGBT inclusive. While a growing number of medical schools are teaching future doctors how to address health concerns that can be specific to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, studies show current doctors only get about five hours of training, if they get any at all. The transgender life: What to know, say and understand . For members of the LGBT community who live in more rural and conservative areas like Nebraska, the struggle to get good, or at least up-to-date, medical care may be even more difficult. In general, legal protections and institutional supports for LGBT Nebraskans are already thin, spotty or nonexistent. On March 2, the United States District Court struck down Nebraska's ban on marriage for same-sex couples, but that ruling is on appeal. Then there were 12: Nebraska ordered to end same-sex marriage ban . Without the legal institution of marriage, LGBT Nebraskans typically lack family health benefits, unless their employers provide them to same-sex partners. A 2014 study from the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles found that states without LGBT legal protections in place see lower rates of health insurance coverage for LGBT residents than states with protections. That plays out in Nebraska. A 2014 study from researchers at the University of Nebraska Omaha found that LGBT residents in the rural parts of the state have lower rates of health insurance coverage than their counterparts in urban areas. Time to close HIV's racial disparities . Even when LGBT Nebraskans have health insurance, they struggle to find providers versed in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender heath care needs. Research shows that LGBT individuals often experience health issues linked to being regular targets of discrimination or social stigma. Discrimination has been linked to higher rates of substance abuse, suicide and stress-related illnesses, which can include heart problems, obesity, eating disorders and cancer. If the available doctors are not familiar with the increased rates of these issues, they may provide inadequate care. Patients who find their doctors do not understand their issues may also delay treatment, often with bad health outcomes, said Jay Irwin, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Nebraska-Omaha and a researcher in LGBT health. Sometimes patients are turned away by providers who don't want to treat LGBT patients, particularly if there are no laws to prohibit such discrimination. Irwin has completed studies that focus on the health care challenges of lesbians in rural areas and found that many people feel isolated and are afraid to come out -- or risk discrimination in the medical office. Supreme Court same sex marriage decision could impact election . Nebraska's sheer size doesn't help. Sixteenth largest in the nation by geography, members of its LGBT community often live far from large cities with significant LGBT populations and with teaching hospitals with staff members who have experience working with members of that community. The Human Rights Campaign's 2014 Healthcare Equality Index named four Nebraska health care facilities, all in Omaha, as leaders in LGBT health care equality. Omaha is on the state's eastern border with Iowa. LGBT residents in western Nebraska -- for instance, places like North Platte -- have to travel 270 miles in either direction, to Omaha or Denver, Colorado, to reach facilities designated as leaders by the Human Rights Campaign. People who work within the health care system have seen some improvement when it comes to treating members of the LGBT community. Jill Young is the client services manager at Nebraska AIDS Project's Scottsbluff, Nebraska, office in the western part of the state. She recalled when she started working there in the late 1990s she saw medical staff refuse care to LGBT people with HIV/AIDS. HIV deaths among African-Americans drop 18%, CDC says . ""We had nurses, for example, who said they wouldn't serve patients with HIV/AIDS,"" Young said. ""But we've come a long way since then."" Young has seen more hospitals in the region adopting policies that are supportive of LGBT residents, including one that just started recognizing same-sex partners' wills as legal documents that will allow them access to their partners when they are being cared for in areas restricted to immediate family only. But she said she still sees too many LGBT residents traveling great distances to get care and she still sees too many patients who don't seek medical care until it is too late. ""We still go to the hospital,"" she said, ""and see people who are days away from dying."" Eric Yarwood, 44, has more experience than he would like with Nebraska's health care facilities. He spent over 100 days last year at hospitals in Omaha for complications related to germ cell cancer. He had nine rounds of chemotherapy, three stem cell transplants, his third surgery two weeks ago and five more days for followup last week. For all but four of the days he was in the hospital, his partner, Aaron Persen, 36, was at his side every evening. ""Aaron and I are a unit,"" Yarwood said. ""I can count on my fingers the number of times he didn't come."" While the couple has found the overwhelming majority of physicians and medical staff to be ""genuinely supportive"" of their relationship,  there still were a few instances when they felt uncomfortable and unaccepted, once with a physician and another time with a nurse. ""I'm not sure how often the medical staff works with gay couples or receives training on how to work with gay couples,"" Yarwood said. Same-sex marriage fast facts . Yarwood's prognosis is good, and the couple looks with optimism to a future of having more access to LGBT-inclusive health care facilities and a more inclusive state overall. ""Hopefully, by the time we get through the cancer and save a little money,"" Persen said, ""Nebraska will follow most other states and allow our relationship to be legally recognized.""","A 2014 study finds LGBT residents in rural parts of Nebraska have lower rates of health insurance coverage .

"(CNN)The U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert, was attacked in Seoul, and is in stable condition, receiving treatment at a local hospital, according to the U.S. embassy. According to Seoul police, Lippert was slashed on his right cheek and hand with a knife measuring about 10 inches long at 5:42 p.m. ET on Wednesday. A South Korean news agency reported that the suspect was opposed to the joint South Korea-U.S. military drills that launched earlier this week, but Seoul police said the motive for the attack and how it was organized are under investigation. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf confirmed the ambassador had been attacked while giving a speech in Seoul Thursday morning, and said that the South Korean embassy is coordinating with local law enforcement on the attack. ""We strongly condemn this act of violence. The ambassador is being treated at a local hospital. His injuries are not life threatening,"" she said. South Korean president, Park Geun-hye condemned the attack: ""This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador, but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated."" She pledged a ""thorough investigation and strengthening"" of protection. Lippert is a longtime friend and confidant of President Barack Obama, who has been a member of his inner circle since the President's time as senator. According to National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan, Obama called Lippert to wish him well. ""The President called U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Korea, Mark Lippert, to tell him that he and his wife Robyn are in his thoughts and prayers, and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery,"" Meehan said in a statement. According to local police chief Yoon Myung-seon, the event was organized by the Korea Council For Reconciliation and Cooperation, and the suspect in the attack was a member of the council. According to South Korean news agency Yonhap, the suspect is a 55-year-old man with the last name ""Kim,"" who authorities say was opposed to the joint South Korea-U.S. military drills that kicked off earlier this week. Yonhap reported that the suspect came up from behind, pushed Lippert down on a table and started attacking him. In July 2010, Kim received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese Ambassador to South Korea, Yonhap said. South Korea's YTN news channel reported that Lippert was about to deliver a speech at a breakfast being held at Sejong Hall in Seoul. The report says nothing specific about the attack, only that yelling was heard and then the bloodied ambassador was taken to the hospital. The suspect was reportedly detained and is currently under investigation. Lippert has been close to Obama ever since he arrived in the Senate in 2005. Lippert worked with Obama on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and traveled the world with the senator as he garnered the foreign policy experience that helped pave the way for his presidential campaign. When Obama declared he would run for president in the 2008 race, Lippert was by his side again, and was on the road with the candidate and ultimately served as the chief foreign policy adviser for the Obama campaign. In 2007, Lippert was deployed as a Naval Reserve Lieutenant to Iraq to work as an intelligence officer with Navy SEALS. A Wall Street Journal profile of the diplomat published that year detailed an anecdote in which Lippert received an email on his Blackberry from then-Sen. Obama which read, ""I miss you, brother."" Lippert's deployment was not without irony, because he was in Iraq at a time when his boss was actively campaigning against what he said was a ""dumb war."" After his deployment, Lippert returned to Washington and served as deputy national security adviser and chief of staff for the National Security Council in the Obama White House. In October 2009, however, he decided to return to active duty. He was deployed to Afghanistan and he also served as an intelligence officer for the Naval Special Warfare Development Group in Virginia Beach. ""He is a close friend, and I admire and respect his devotion to our country and answering the call to active duty service,"" Obama said in a statement at the time. Lippert was nominated to be the top Asia policy official in the Pentagon in 2011, amid stories that he had clashed with former national security adviser, retired Gen. James Jones, while he served on the NSC. Bob Woodward reported in his book, ""Obama's Wars,"" that Jones resented Lippert and another former Senate aide Denis McDonough, who later was to become White House chief of staff, referring to them as part of the ""politburo"" who he thought thwarted the effective framing of policy. Woodward reported in the book that Obama affectionately referred to the two close aides by the Dr. Seuss nickname of ""Thing One and Thing Two."" Obama nominated Lippert to serve as ambassador to South Korea last year. CNN's Barbara Starr, Jim Acosta and Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","U.S. ambassador to South Korea attacked, but in stable condition ."
"(CNN)Samuel Eto'o wanted to buy a watch. It was in London that he decided to purchase one particular model, one which cost $15,000. For a former Premier League footballer, a hero in his native Cameroon, and one of the most successful African footballers of all time, the prospect of buying a watch was hardly the most daring of ordeals. So after taking a glance at the watch and getting out his credit card, he says he asked the sales assistant for some help. ""I asked the saleswoman -- who was also black like me -- 'Could you show me that watch please?' ""First, I saw her turn and look at her coworkers like, 'Uh, what should I do?' ""Eventually, she let me see the watch. I looked at it and said, 'OK, I'll buy it.' ""I took out my credit card and when she went to go run it through the machine, she came back and said that it was declined. ""I asked her, 'Was it declined or did you not want it to be accepted?' because this has happened to me many times and she told me, 'No, it was declined.'"" Eto'o, who played in London with Chelsea last season, called his brother who was nearby and it was he who brought a new credit card so the transaction could be completed. While Eto'o does speak English, his brother has a far wider vocabulary and was able to ask just what had occurred moments earlier. ""My brother can afford this and the way you're treating him shows that you think just because he's black, he can't afford this watch,"" said the sibling. Eto'o then takes up the story, saying the lady in the store said she was wary of him because ""we had some Nigerians in the store the other day who came with fake credit cards."" ""If one of my own makes a mistake, they judge us all. Tomorrow, if a white man in Africa makes a mistake, we should judge all white people? No! ""The security guard from Senegal kept trying to justify what the lady said and I asked him where he's from. When he told me, I said, 'Ahh. If I gave you my name, you will recognize who I am?' ""He shrugged and I said, 'I'm Eto'o.' He went, 'Nooooo! Just yesterday, my wife and I were talking about you! Can I take a picture with you and send it to my wife?' ""I said, 'Yes, we can take a picture, but you made a mistake because you can't judge people by the color of their skin,' so he told me it wasn't because of our color. ""I told the lady, 'In my next interview, I'm going to tell them about this and I'll name the store so everyone can know that you treat people differently here,' added Eto'o referring to the saleswoman. ""She then realized that I could have reported what she had just done, but it was a mistake. It was a mistake of her to categorize. ""I don't think she's a racist person, but she stereotyped all black people as 'those people'."" Eto'o tells this story to demonstrate his belief that racism is not just football's problem but one that society as a whole must combat. The Cameroon international has played across the world in England, Italy, Spain as well as a spell in Russia with Anzhi Makhachkala. He says he has experienced racism on and off the field, most famously during his time playing for Barcelona. In 2006, during a game against Real Zaragoza, Eto'o was subjected to ""monkey chants"" -- and the forward came close to walking off the pitch. He says it was only because of persuasion by his teammate Fran that he stayed on and helped his side to a 2-0 victory. In 2010, while playing for Inter Milan at Cagliari, Eto'o was again subjected to racist chanting which caused a three-minute stoppage to the contest. The referee addressed both captains while a message was also broadcast inside the stadium warning supporters the game would be abandoned if the chanting did not stop. Eto'o went on to score the only goal of the game as Inter triumphed 1-0. ""You have to understand that football is just a reflection of what we have in society,"" said Eto'o. ""It's not that football is here and society is here -- no, it's a reflection of what goes on in society. ""Football is a great opportunity for certain people, who sometimes think they're better than you or different than others, to express their views as right ... or as a chance to hurt other people. ""The first time I experienced racism wasn't on a football pitch, but the truth is that I never thought that that could happen to me on a football pitch because football is a passion, it's a feeling that touches millions of people. ""Sometimes, the fact that you're a footballer makes you think that racism can't happen to you because you bring that passion and you express a lot of things. ""When it happened to me, I couldn't believe it and in that moment, I decided to walk off the pitch."" Eto'o, now 34, believes there has been progress within the game in recent years and has decided that it is safe enough for his children to return to stadiums. In 2007, he said he did not want his kids having to watch him being booed and subjected to racist abuse. ""I said that back then because racist incidents almost seemed to be fashionable,"" Eto'o explains. ""When you arrive at a football ground, this is going to happen -- when there's a black player, this will happen. ""In that moment, I said, 'No, my kids aren't going to go and see that because it will be very difficult to explain.' ""If you tell a child, go to the right and you'll get a reward, he'll always go to the right because he wants the reward. A child comes to see his father play, have fun, make people happy and what does he see? ""He sees people booing his father for being black, they make monkey noises, they throw bananas at his teammates and all that. ""But we see more and more that authorities are fighting, people are increasingly against what happens in football grounds and in society is getting better."" Eto'o was presented with the European Medal of Tolerance from the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation following a ceremony in London earlier this week. For a man who has won three European Champions League titles, his assertion that this particular award is his ""biggest"" gives an insight into Eto'o's mindset in dealing with the scourge of racism. ""It's the most important,"" Eto'o said of the award. ""It's something that affects us all and to recognize the little work that I've done, the truth is that I'm very, very happy because you can win the Champions League, you can win championships, you can score goals, but to represent a fight that affects millions and millions of people ... it's one of a kind."" Eto'o also defended Russia's record of dealing with racism, despite FIFA, the sport's world governing body, expressing its concerns over how the country's authorities deal with the problem. According to a report published earlier this month by the FARE network, an anti-racism body, and the Sova Center, which conducts research on nationalism and racism, there were more than 200 cases of discriminatory behavior within the Russian game over two seasons. The fans of CSKA Moscow, one of Russia's most famous clubs have been serial offenders in terms of racism with UEFA, the game's European governing body, handing out punishments on numerous occasions. Yet, Eto'o, now playing in Italy with Sampdoria, retains fond memories of Russia. The four-time African Player of the Year joined Anzhi in 2011 following a deal which made him the highest paid player in the world on a reported salary of $13 million a year. He scored 36 goals in 71 appearances before joining Chelsea in 2013 -- but he rejects any suggestions that Russia is a hotbed for racism ahead of the 2018 World Cup. ""At the World Cup in Russia, you'll see that there won't be incidents like this,"" he added. ""I hope there aren't because I've played there and I had a great time there and I know the efforts that the Russians are making to try to improve certain things that have happened there, and we have to support these efforts. ""Football is beautiful. Football is beautiful because whether you win, draw or lose, you can go and shake your opponent's hand whether they're white or black or red or blue. ""This is football. This is where football wins, but when there are incidents like this, it's shameful, but it doesn't mean this will happen in the World Cup just because it's in Russia. ""I was there and I lived a beautiful experience.""","Samuel Eto'o determined to rid football of racism .

"London (CNN)Britain needs more women as spies -- and it could do worse than look to recruit them on popular parenting website Mumsnet. That's according to a report released Thursday by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee. The report recommends targeting women, including mothers and those who are middle-aged or mid-career, to help break through ""the permafrost"" of men in middle management ""who have a very traditional male mentality and outlook."" The idea that a new cohort of British spies could be signed up via Mumsnet, more usually associated with debates on pregnancy, childcare and homemaking, may surprise some. But lawmaker Hazel Blears, a committee member, said recruiting more women to the three intelligence and security agencies the committee oversees is a crucial way to change the intelligence agencies' sometimes hidebound culture. The current setup fosters ""a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career and does not fully recognise the value of a more consultative, collaborative approach,"" she said. But women's life experience and other qualities should not be overlooked, she said. In a sign of the changing times, the latest film iteration of British spy James Bond has had a female boss -- ""M,"" played by Judi Dench. But while women currently make up about 37% of the employees across the UK intelligence agencies, according to the Intelligence and Security Committee report, they make up fewer than one-fifth of those in senior roles. The recruiting idea has met with some amusement in the Mumsnet community. ""If they need someone whose special skill is getting melted chocolate down her dog-haired jumper and not noticing, I'm their woman,"" posts one Mumsnet user. ""I would LOVE to be a spy. Like actually LOVE it. And no one would suspect me. I am too boring and frumpy,"" writes another. A third, more skeptical, comments: ""Yes, people who can't help but type their every passing thought into an online forum would make great spies."" Besides using women-focused outlets like Mumsnet to reach a new pool of talent, the committee recommends certain steps to make working for MI5, MI6 and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) more tempting for women. These include offering better career management, encouraging women to set up their own informal support networks and not limiting their options if they have children. ""Women who have successfully been filling operational roles mustn't be sidelined after they have children. They still have the first class skills that the Agencies helped them to build, so these should be used,"" Blears said. Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright -- who similarly looked into the position of women in the CIA -- backed the UK report and what it said about the value of women in the intelligence agencies. ""Diversity should be pursued -- not just on legal or ethical grounds, important as these are in their own right -- but because it will result in a better response to the range of threats that threaten national security,"" she said.","More women are needed to change the culture of Britain's intelligence agencies, report says .

"(CNN)Many years ago I performed at the Surf Ballroom, in Clear Lake, Iowa, which was the last stop on Buddy Holly's final tour. He was killed in a plane crash in 1959 that also took the lives of singers J.P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson and Ritchie Valens. By this time, Buddy Holly and I had had a pretty long history together. The concert that I performed at had all the old members of his group. Donna, who Ritchie Valens wrote a song about, was also there.  Peggy Sue, who Buddy Holly sang about, was there too. The Picks were there -- they sang background vocals on Buddy's records -- as well as singer Tommy Allsup, who claimed that years later he got his wallet back from the crash site. Unfortunately some fans at this show were selling crash-site photos, which I thought was in extremely bad taste. I think the prospect of the National Transportation Safety Board delving into the crash again, which might mean exhuming bodies and all the rest, would be in similarly bad taste. I think there's a reason we say, ""rest in peace."" Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments which, in retrospect, nobody -- and I mean nobody, not the Beatles the Rolling Stones or anyone else -- can beat, for these reasons: By the time he was 22 years old he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself and each of them, in my view and the view of many others, a hit. Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed. No rock 'n' roll records can touch songs like ""Rave On,"" ""Think it Over,"" ""Not Fade Away,"" ""Peggy Sue"" and many, many more. He was also a sensitive, ballad composer and singer, which people often overlook, with songs like ""Moondreams"" and ""True Love Ways,"" among many. As a paperboy, I cut open the stack of papers on February 3, 1959, and saw that Buddy Holly had been killed in the plane crash. The next day I went to school in shock, and guess what? Nobody cared. Rock 'n roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57, nor had the others in the plane crash. Americans in those days were always looking ahead. Death was not lingered over. We'd had enough of that in World War II. Death and grief did not go with the exuberance and bright colors of the 1950s. Since then we have embarked on what I would call the ""American death trip."" One simply has to look at the slew of autopsy shows on television and the endless regurgitation of Marilyn, Elvis and JFK death details to get my point. Furthermore, because of the ever-growing psychological power of the media, we seem to think we can reach back half a century and touch things as if they are real. We live in a virtual nostalgic world because of this. Fortunately, Buddy Holly's music is forever young and all any young person has to do is listen to it and his life will be changed forever.","Don McLean: It's bad idea for NTSB to re-examine 1959 crash that killed Buddy Holly, ""Big Bopper,"" Ritchie Valens .

"(CNN)One-year-old Viktoria lives almost entirely in the dark. She was born in Donetsk, as the crisis in eastern Ukraine was taking hold last year.  Now, she and her parents stay in a putrid cellar that also serves as a bomb shelter, on the outskirts of the city.  They are usually packed in tight with  dozens of other people. It takes torchlight to see their faces: children, women, men and the elderly, sitting in a sea of filth.  There is no water and no toilet, just buckets overflowing in a space where people have to eat and sleep.  This is the world Viktoria has experienced so far, the place where she is having to learn to talk and walk. It's an extraordinary contrast with just a few years before, when Donetsk was a thriving city that helped host the European Football Championship.  Now the streets are empty and most of the shops are closed.  The shelling is so incessant that our driver tells me it feels like having techno music playing constantly in the background. I hear a lot about the politics of the Ukraine conflict: which leader has said what to whom, the provenance of arms, the big picture.  What is missing from the debate is the people -- it is ordinary citizens who are suffering the most.  Behind the grand headlines, there are children in desperate need who are suffering now and who will continue to suffer the consequences of the crisis in years to come. Around 1.7 million children are affected by the conflict in Ukraine -- including more than a thousand who are seeking refuge in bomb shelters in Donetsk.  These are not modern bunkers.  They are freezing holes, normally in the cellar of a house, which are simply unfit for human habitation.  If a building collapses in a bombing, everyone will be buried. That is why in Debaltseve, for example, aid organizations are bringing body bags with them.  Children are unbelievably stressed.  They have seen friends and relatives die.  They are afraid to even step outside of the cellars, as they fear they will never come back. On a recent U.N. aid convoy into Donetsk, UNICEF delivered more than 27 metric tons of essential hygiene supplies, education kits and drinking water.  We made sure we prioritized the neediest children -- those in underground bomb shelters as well as those who are living with disabilities, who have been orphaned or who are affected by HIV. But this is not the sort of childhood one would imagine for 21st century Ukraine. In a country where children are too often institutionalized, the ongoing crisis can only exacerbate the problem.  Social systems are collapsing and children are bearing the brunt.  In an orphanage for babies born to HIV-positive women, we found there were no tests to check if babies were HIV positive or not, let alone the necessary medication to treat them.  These babies are in limbo -- nobody wants to adopt them and their status is not known. This area of Ukraine had one of the highest level of HIV before the conflict began. Now we just have no idea how bad the situation has become.  Elsewhere, we found children in detention in Donetsk who hadn't seen relatives in more than a year.  In a center for children with disabilities, mothers told us they had no insulin for their diabetic sons and daughters. We have to help these children now, but also plan for when the fighting stops -- people will need new homes, and we'll have to deal with unexploded ordnance and the terrible psychological damage on children, among other things.  This is not a case of delivering aid now and that's the end of the story.  We need to commit for the long term. Until then, though, the needs are huge and resources are scarce. In December, UNICEF called for additional support of $32.4 million to scale up its humanitarian response to address the urgent needs of children and families in conflict-affected areas in Ukraine. Today the needs are even greater. In the basement shelter, Viktoria's parents cradle her tightly.  They ask me the same question again and again: ""When will it all be over?""","Radoslaw Rzehak: About 1.7 million children affected by conflict in Ukraine .

"London (CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters are trying to create ""an atmosphere of hysteria"" and ""fear-mongering,"" the Iranian foreign minister said Thursday. ""The only explanation that you can have here is that some people consider peace and stability as an existential threat,"" Javad Zarif told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""Because a deal cannot be threatening to anybody unless you want conflict and tension and mistrust and crises."" In a highly controversial speech to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday, Netanyahu said that far from stopping Iran, the deal currently being negotiated in Switzerland would pave Iran's way to nuclear weapons. Zarif told Amanpour that Netanyahu's speech had ""no effect on the negotiating table."" He spoke from Montreux, Switzerland, where Iran, the U.S. and five other countries are trying to hammer out an agreement that would trade sanctions relief for guarantees on Iran's nuclear program. Zarif told Amanpour that he believed negotiators were ""very close"" to such a deal, but only if everybody avoided ""the path of confrontation."" ""Everybody has to make tough choices. We have made the choice to engage in negotiations, although we believe that this entire exercise was unnecessary -- this was a manufactured crisis."" ""People have been predicting for the past 20 years that Iran was a year away from making a bomb, and that prediction has been proven wrong time and again,"" Zarif said. ""But unfortunately that is a reality, that this hysteria that has been fanned continues to be fanned. And we try to resolve that problem."" While the details of a definitive deal are still decidedly out of reach -- ""I'm not prepared to negotiate on the air"" -- Zarif told Amanpour that he had hope for a ""win-win situation for all."" ""The object of this exercise is to ensure that Iran's nuclear program will always remain peaceful, and to remove all the restrictions that have been imposed on Iran, in our view unjustifiably,"" he said. ""You can either have sanctions and continue to seek that path of confrontation, or try to resolve this issue through negotiations and through an agreement."" As Iran negotiates its nuclear future, a war against ISIS is being waged in neighboring Iraq. Tehran has supplied the Baghdad government with advisers, weapons, and ammunition, and one of its top generals, Qassim Sulaimani, has been sent to the country, according to the semiofficial Iranian FARS news agency. The Pentagon has suggested that Iranians could themselves be participating in the fight, which Zarif denied. ""We do not have forces on the ground in Iraq. We have always had advisers helping the Iraqi government and the Iraqi army,"" he said. ""We were the first to come to the assistance of the Iraqis, both in Baghdad as well as in Irbil, when the ISIS started moving in in massive numbers last summer."" ""Everybody knows that without our assistance, things would have been different in Iraq,"" he added. ""We hope that this could unite Iraqis."" The United States, which also has military advisers in Iraq and has launched an air campaign against ISIS, adamantly denies that it coordinates with Iran in the fight against their common enemy. ""This is a global threat,"" Zarif said. ""You see the implications in Europe, you see the fact that they are recruiting from Europe. So this is a global problem, it requires global cooperation and global work.""

"(CNN)Don't bogart that spoon, man. Lemme get a hit off that cone, dude. Pass the bowl ... of ice cream? Could Ben and Jerry's, the counterculture snack empire gone mainstream, be planning a marijuana-infused ice cream? ""Makes sense to me. You know, combine your pleasures,"" co-founder Ben Cohen said in an interview with HuffPost Live that's been buzzing among marijuana aficionados since it aired last month. Like attitudes about marijuana itself, the story went mainstream this week. It makes some sense. Co-founder Jerry Greenfield noted that the duo has some experience with, uh, substances. And the company already gives a nod to the marijuana culture with flavor names such as ""Half Baked."" Marijuana is becoming more mainstream, too. Four states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, and attitudes nationwide have been changing in favor of pot, which remains banned by federal law. In January 2014, a CNN/ORC poll found that 55% of Americans favored the legalization of marijuana. Only 16% thought that in 1987, CNN reported at the time. In Colorado, where recreational marijuana use is legal under state law, edibles containing weed now make up nearly half the market for pot products, according to the Denver Post. Alas, pot fans, Cohen and Greenfield no longer control the company. They sold it to Unilever Inc. for $326 million in 2000. ""If It were my decision, I'd be doing it,"" Greenfield told HuffPost Live. ""But fortunately, we have wiser heads at the company that figure those things out."" A spokeswoman for the company told AdWeek magazine that there aren't any current plans for pot ice cream, but she left the door open to the possibility. ""Ben & Jerry's hasn't given serious consideration to the possibility of cannabis-infused ice cream,"" spokeswoman Kelly Mohr told AdWeek. ""Perhaps it's high time."" Of course, all this does make you wonder: What would you munch on if you got the munchies from a bowl of Ben & Jerry's? Is weed legal in your state?

"Hong Kong (CNN)Disgraced former People's Liberation Army (PLA) general Xu Caihou has died of bladder cancer, Chinese state media has reported. He was 71. Xu, who passed away at a hospital on Sunday, became one of the highest-profile figures in China's military to be caught up in President Xi Jinping's war on corruption last year, when the government launched an investigation into him on the back of bribery allegations. The court decided not to prosecute Xu due to his illness, but said his illegal income, including the bribes he was determined to have accepted would be handled in accordance with the law. Formerly a vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, the body which runs the two-million strong PLA, Xu was also expelled from the Chinese Communist Party and had his rank of general revoked, according to a statement from the state-run Xinhua news agency. A seven-month investigation, which began in March last year, found that Xu took advantage of his position to assist the promotion of other people. He confessed to accepting bribes personally and through his family. He was also found to have sought profits for others in exchange for bribes taken through his family members. The amount he received was ""extremely huge,"" the statement added. In Chinese President Xi Jinping's annual New Year speech, he reiterated China's ""zero-tolerance"" stance towards corruption, vowing to keep ""waving high the sword against corruption"" and ""fastening the cage of regulations."" 2014 saw Xi take down two top officials in China's fight against corruption, in addition to Xu. He took down former domestic security czar Zhou Yongkang, likely soon to become the most senior Chinese official ever to face corruption charges, and Ling Jihua, a top aide to ex-President Hu Jintao. State media have touted the trio as the three biggest ""tigers"" caught in Xi's now-two year old anti-graft campaign, which has a stated goal of targeting both ""tigers and flies"" -- high-and low-ranking officials.","Xu, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, dies of bladder cancer .

"(CNN)Diplomacy can be dangerous. U.S. diplomats have come under attack in various places in the last few decades. Here's a look at U.S. diplomats who have been killed in the line of duty. The first U.S. ambassador assassinated while in office was John Gordon Mein, the U.S. ambassador to Guatemala. According to a telegram from the embassy in Guatemala City, a young man dressed in fatigues and carrying a sub-machine gun on  August 28, 1968, ordered Mein's vehicle to stop and for the ambassador to get out. He did, then ran -- prompting a cry of ""Shoot him, kill him."" Mein was shot and fell to the ground about 12 yards behind his limousine. Cleo Noel Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Sudan, was nearing the end of a March 1973 reception in the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum when terrorists stormed in. The gunmen took Noel and another American, as well as diplomats from Saudi Arabia, Belgium and Jordan, according to a U.S. intelligence memo. The captors' demand: Free various people, mostly Palestinian guerillas, then imprisoned in Jordan, Israel and the United States. This spurred negotiations that didn't go anywhere, ending instead with the killing of Noel, fellow U.S. diplomat George Curtis Moore and Belgium's Charge d'Affaires. U.S. authorities say the assailants belonged to the Palestinian terrorist movement known as ""Black September,"" claiming that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed off on the attack. Ambassador Rodger Davies, who had been in Cyprus for less than months, hunkered down in a hallway on August 19, 1974, hoping he was safe from those involved in a nearby demonstration. Instead, a bullet penetrated the embassy compound and struck his heart, killing him instantly. Antoinette Varnava, a 31-year-old local who was part of the small embassy staff for about a decade, also died in the violence. U.S. ambassador to Lebanon Francis Meloy, his economic counselor Robert O. Waring and their Lebanese driver disappeared in June 1976 as they crossed the Green Line, the division between Beirut's Christian and Muslim sectors. Their bullet-riddled bodies were found a short time later in mainly Muslim west Beirut, which was then controlled by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's guerrillas. Two former Muslim guerillas were convicted in the kidnapping and killings, only to be freed in 1996. About eight months after President Jimmy Carter appointed him as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Adolph Dubs was taken from his car while heading home from the embassy. His captors took the Foreign Service veteran to the Hotel Kabul, where Dubs died in a shootout between captors and Afghan police -- a violent death that, whomever fired the fatal bullets, the U.S. State Department considers an assassination. A former eight-story hotel facing the sea transformed into America's embassy in Beirut turned into a war zone in April 1983, when a truck loaded with explosives was rammed into its entrance. The result was horrific. Offices were pancaked on top of each other, the elevator shaft and stairwell destroyed, the cafeteria full of bodies and rubble, recalled the then U.S. ambassador Robert Dillon, who himself was dug out of the rubble. While 44 people inside the embassy survived the blast, 17 Americans, 25 Foreign Service nationals, 10 contract workers and 10 visa applicants and passerby did not. In 2008, Dillon said the attack was believed to have been carried out by a family ""under the direction of members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards."" On August 7, 1998 -- around the exact same time a bomb went off at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 11 -- a huge explosion tore through the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) lists eight people as having died in the attack on its memorial remembering Americans who died while serving the U.S. government abroad in a foreign affairs capacity.  Twelve Americans total were killed. Those are both jarring numbers, but they're still a fraction of the more than 200 people total killed in the attack, in addition to more than 4,000 wounded. In May 2001, a U.S. jury found four purported al Qaeda members guilty on all charges stemming from the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. As his wife of 34 years looked on, Laurence Foley was shot dead outside his home in Amman, Jordan, by a lone gunman in December 2002. A public servant for close to 40 years, the Boston-born Foley was serving as executive officer of the USAID mission in Amman at the time. U.S. officials were quick to label Foley's killing a murder, with the head of the AFSA calling it a ""brutal terrorist attack."" They later implicated Iraqi-based terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi for providing ""financial and other support to the terrorists who assassinated"" Foley. Exactly 11 years after the September 11 attacks in New York, Washington and rural Pennsylvania, terrorists struck at Americans again -- this time some 5,000 miles away in the Libyan city of Benghazi. That's where Ambassador Christopher Stevens was when mortar and rocket fire struck a U.S. diplomatic annex there. Stevens didn't survive, nor did State Department computer expert Sean Smith or Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, two former U.S. Navy SEALs then acting as security contractors. The attack was first portrayed as violence by an angry mob responding to a video made in the U.S. that mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. But officials later determined that it was a terrorist attack. Anne Smedinghoff, a 25-year-old public diplomacy officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, was delivering books to a school in southern Afghanistan when a suicide bomber smashed into her convoy. She died in that April 2013 attack, as did four others. ""We thought she was relatively safe in the embassy compound,"" her father Tom Smedinghoff told CNN. ""But as it turned out, Anne really wanted to do a lot more.""","Several U.S. diplomats have died after being attacked .

"Moscow (CNN)Ever since Vladimir Putin came to power, there have been killings of politicians, of human rights activists, of journalists. Boris Nemtsov, one of Russia's most prominent opposition figures, is only the latest victim. The key thing all these crimes have in common is that none of them get properly resolved. Of course, the Kremlin will issue condemnation and condolences, as it has done over the assassination of Nemtsov. But the killers and the people who ordered the killings don't usually end up facing justice -- and if you are an opposition politician in Russia, or a human rights activist, or a journalist, you will know this. If the dangers weren't clear enough, the circumstances of the most recent killing are a stark reminder. It was late Friday night. Boris Nemtsov and his girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, a Ukrainian model, had eaten dinner at plush restaurant on Red Square. Afterwards, despite the chilly weather, they decided to walk back to his apartment, perhaps to take in the stunning views. The Kremlin looks spectacular at night. It was on this short journey, in the heart of Moscow, that the gunman struck, leaving Nemtsov dead within sight of the red Kremlin walls -- walls which, by the way, bristle with security cameras. In the days since, thousands have made pilgrimage to the place where the outspoken Putin critic was shot to pay their respects, leaving a mountain of flowers and personal messages. An opposition rally on Sunday, which Nemtsov was meant to lead, was canceled and replaced with a mourning march past the crime scene. It was the biggest pro-opposition rally in the Russian capital for years. But few who took part could have missed the symbolism, the real message the killers -- whoever they are -- sent by gunning down such a prominent Kremlin critic in the shadow of its towering walls. It's this: if you oppose the Kremlin, if you criticize its power, if you stand for greater democracy and reform, as Boris Nemtsov did, this could happen to you too. It's hard to predict what impact this message will have. ""Yet another terrible page has been turned in the history we all share,"" wrote Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the once-jailed oligarch-turned Kremlin critic now in exile. ""What the next page holds is up to each and every one of us,"" he said, commenting on the death of Nemtsov. The statement was issued under the banner ""We Are Not Afraid"". But many Russians I've spoken to since the killing are, in fact, very afraid. And while the hope among opposition activists is that Nemtsov's killing may at least invigorate their ranks, one very real possibility is that it will do the exact opposite: further silence an already very quiet minority opposed to the rule of Vladimir Putin.","A series of Kremlin critics have been murdered since Vladimir Putin came to power .

"(CNN)How do Republicans try to breathe new life into an old scandal? We've seen it time and time again. Here's how it works: . Step One: Republicans, with nothing in their arsenal to use against Hillary Clinton, selectively leak to reporters a ""scandalous"" tidbit -- often one that has been previously reported. Step Two: The new media bites. Step Three: The media hyperventilates and suffocates the airwaves with repetition of the same story. Step Four: Upon further examination, the story falls apart. This is exactly how the latest media hype, this time over Hillary Clinton's use of emails at the State Department, has played out. And it presents yet another chapter in the Benghazi hoax. The New York Times story about Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account at the State Department is a perfect example of ""gotcha"" journalism, where reporters will take any bait the Republicans give them without proper vetting. The New York Times has a history of this. (Whitewater, anyone?) The Times story suggests Secretary Clinton broke federal rules in relation to her email. But the Times' main source for this allegation says Clinton violated no laws. Yes, Clinton used a private email account to communicate while she was secretary of state. But so did secretaries of state before her. According to the State Department spokesman Marie Harf, John Kerry is the first secretary of state ever to rely primarily on official State Department email. Clinton asks State to release emails: What you need to know . In October 2014, 18 months after Clinton left, the State Department was engaged in the process of updating its records preservation policies.  The State Department asked every secretary of state dating back to Madeleine Albright to provide records, including emails, from their time in office. Clinton responded to the State Department's request for emails, providing the department with over 55,000 pages of emails. She did so months ago. Clinton has been fully transparent and has asked the State Department for these emails to be made public. Republican investigators seeking to hype the current Benghazi investigation leaked the issue to keep a dying investigation alive. And once again, reporters bit. In the days since The New York Times posted its story, there have been dozens and dozens of stories written on the topic. Why? Because the Clintons are held to a double standard when it comes to media scrutiny. Their perfectly usual, above board behavior is spun as secretive and unaccountable -- while Republicans are left relatively unscathed. Mitt Romney used his private email account to discuss political business, and when he left the governor's office, his administration destroyed records rather than turn them over to state archives. Scott Walker's County Executive's office used a secret email system, which investigators determined was being used to engage in campaign work on county time and to avoid public records disclosure laws. Mike Huckabee's office had files, including emails, cleaned and physically destroyed, including ""travel records, calendars, call logs, and emails."" Why hasn't their behavior been scrutinized over and over again? Because their last name isn't Clinton. In the end, all we are left with is the benign fact that Hillary Clinton used a personal email account at the State Department. This isn't even a revelation -- it has been known for years. Looks like the Republicans wasted their breath, once again, for nothing.","David Brock: The story is another example of GOP efforts to create a phony controversy .
Hillary Clinton's email practices didn't break the law, he says ."
"(CNN)All you need is luck, to misquote one of Liverpool's most famous exports, The Beatles. But Liverpool's footballers won't mind one bit that a fortunate goal sealed a vital win at Swansea to set up a pivotal clash with Manchester United at the weekend. One of English soccer's biggest rivalries is renewed on Sunday with vital points at stake in the race for a place in next season's European Champions League. Jordan Henderson knew little about his winner in Wales, the ball flying in after Jordi Amat's clearance struck him, but it helped make it seven wins out of eight for the Reds. A sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home pulled it within two points of Manchester United in fourth, with just four points separating Liverpool from Manchester City in second. ""It's a great result,"" Henderson told Sky Sports. ""The first half was disappointing but I felt as though we did better in second half, passed the ball and created a few chances. ""It was a great pass by Daniel, I got a little fortunate with the finish but you've got to be in the right position to score. ""Overall we're delighted with three points and we now look forward to Sunday. We can't wait for it, we are high on confidence and have great momentum but United played well the other day. ""It'll be a tough one but at Anfield we go in confident and hopefully we'll get the result we need."" In a lackluster start, Daniel Sturridge dragged a shot wide of post for Liverpool before England international Adam Lallana fired a fierce half-volley right at Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. From then on Swansea asserted control. Martin Skrtel had to be alert to clear as Swansea's French striker Bafetimbi Gomis -- starting for the first time since collapsing on the pitch at Tottenham earlier this month -- headed at goal. Gomis then played a neat one-two with Wayne Routledge before forcing Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet into a fine low save. Next to threaten Liverpool's net was Iceland international Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose effort was arrowing for the top corner before Mignolet intervened. Just before halftime Jonjo Shelvey, a former Liverpool player, went close with a shot from a right wing corner that was deflected wide by Alberto Moreno. But having had a chance to regroup, Liverpool came out galvanized after the break and were soon on the front foot. First Fabianski made a brilliant save to keep out Philippe Coutinho's near post effort before the Pole was then in action again to deny Joe Allen. Though Liverpool were in the ascendency, its opening goal was down to a stroke of luck. As Henderson galloped onto a through ball Swansea's Spanish defender Amat got there first, but his clearance ricocheted off the Liverpool player and into the net past Fabianski. From then on Liverpool did a fine job of squeezing the life out of the game and playing on the counter, striker Daniel Sturridge hitting the post late on as Swansea left gaps at the back.

Officers freed the pup from the tracks and rushed her to Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center, where Dr. Jamie Davidson and staff stabilized and named her. The dog will have to have her front right leg removed because of the damage from the gunshots, but should be rehabilitated within a week, the vet said. ""Dogs rebound quick,"" said Davidson, adding Cabela is in great spirits. ""Really, after everything that this dog has gone through ... she's the sweetest,"" she said. ""I mean she's not angry with people. She's not growling.  She's been really really good."" The cost of Cabela's treatment will run several thousands dollars, but will be picked up by the clinic. Once she's healthy, Cabela will be spayed, vaccinated and set up for adoption, where she will be paired with a ""good family,"" Davidson said.","Police found the pup after neighbors heard gunshots .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN)Kaka grins as he recalls being mobbed by a boisterous crowd chanting his name at a Florida airport arrivals hall in the early summer of 2014. ""It was very nice ... a good surprise for me,"" he said, wistfully casting his mind back to images of football fans waving flags and hollering his name. The graceful Brazilian midfielder once of Sao Paulo, AC Milan and Real Madrid has become used to such fevered adulation over the years. A glittering decade playing in Europe brought Champions Leagues, Scudettos,La Liga titles and, of course, a devoted following. But it wasn't the loyal apostles of Madrid's Ultras Sur, the Curva Sud Milano or even his compatriots in the unmistakeable yellow of A Selecao with whom he won a World Cup in 2002 that provided the heroes welcome in question. Instead it was a passionate crowd festooned in the less heralded purple and white of Orlando City, one of the newest franchises in Major League Soccer. Only founded in 2010, the team will make its MLS bow this week. But interest was high that a former Ballon d'Or winner would be coming to play his football in a place more commonly associated with Disney World and Universal Studios. Local news stations carried live pictures of Kaka's plane touching down. Leaving the airport to officially sign his contract even became a mission in itself, so keen were the Orlando natives to get a glimpse of their first designated signing. ""When I arrived in the airport, this crowd (was) singing the team songs, singing my name. Also (at) my presentation downtown, I was very, very happy,"" Kaka said. ""Now, the city is start(ing) to enjoy this moment and everybody's looking forward to our, first game on March 8."" Such frenzied devotion in the U.S., so long resistant to the charms of the world's most popular sport, may seem strange to fans in Europe and South America, football's historical and cultural heartlands. The MLS is now approaching its 20th season but has long been pejoratively regarded outside North America as a retirement home for once top-level players -- a plastic, commercially driven product devoid of any real identity offering one last payday before the limbs give out. Aged 32 and no doubt the recipient of a handsome remuneration package, there will be many who question whether Kaka is merely jetting in to boost his bank balance before calling it a day. Relaxed and polite as ever, Kaka himself is having none of this. In all honesty, it's hard to imagine a man as conscientious and clearly committed to his faith moving anywhere solely for the money. There was once a time when every Kaka goal resulted in a lifting of his jersey to reveal a T-shirt which stated ""Jesus loves you"" or ""I belong to Jesus."" These days, the celebration of choice is usually the upward point and grateful look to the heavens. ""In every moment of my life, not just on the field, but also off the field, my faith, Jesus Christ and the bible helped me a lot. ""So every time that I can I do my prayer, I read the bible, go to the church. These things help me a lot to stay in good peace on my mind."" His faith was never more important than as an 18-year-old in Sao Paulo when he suffered a serious neck injury. ""All the doctors said look you are lucky to walk in this moment, so you need to be happy you can walk,"" he said. ""And my question was 'but I can play?' Everybody said 'we don't know, we have to wait.' So, in that moment, the faith helped me a lot. ""God always supported me at every moment and after two months I start to play as a professional player. It was a very important moment of my life."" Talking of moments, Kaka describes how moving to the U.S. was always a long-term ambition. Upon meeting Orlando City majority owner Flavio Augusto da Silva in Brazil a number of years ago, the pair discussed the potential of working together. Moves to LA Galaxy and New York Red Bulls were mooted in the interim but never materialized for various reasons. It was then the Orlando opportunity arose which he was only too happy to take. Kaka points to other high-profile players like Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, David Villa and Sebastian Giovinco being attracted to the league as proof of its appeal and progress. ""There's a lot of good players that could have another team in Europe but they chose to come here. I think it's a good moment to be in this league. In a few years, we will listen a lot about the MLS,"" he said. He might just have a point. The forthcoming MLS season marks the first of a new eight-year TV deal and media rights partnership with ESPN, FOX Sports and Univision. On top of this, average attendance across the league for the 2014 season was the highest in recent MLS history, according to data on the MLS Attendance blog. Yet questions remain over the long-term profitability of some teams. A report from Forbes magazine in late 2013 found only 10 out of 19 MLS franchises were making any money. Critics might also argue that the players mentioned by Kaka are past their very best with the possible exception of the 28-year-old Giovinco. Unsurprisingly, the former FIFA World Player of the Year doesn't see it that we way. He reveals he still harbors ambitions of continuing his international career and even making the World Cup in Russia 2018. Last October saw a surprise recall under returning Brazil manager, Dunga. ""I have a three-year contract with Orlando, and at least these three. In four years, we have another World Cup,"" said Kaka, who will be 36 in 2018. "" If I feel good and Brazil needs me (it) will be a good way to stop playing. So I hope I can play another World Cup."" Just mentioning the World Cup in the presence of a Brazilian can be tense after the trauma of last year's incredible semifinal in Belo Horizonte. The 7-1 home-turf mauling at the hands of eventual winners Germany was variously described in the unforgiving Brazilian press at the time as ""an historic humiliation"" and the ""humiliation of all humiliations."" Never before has a Brazilian side looked so inept, so fragile, so lacking in class, flair or bereft of that ephemeral quality known locally as ""joga bonito."" ""That was very hard for us,"" said Kaka even though he wasn't selected for the tournament. ""That defeat in our country, in the semifinal World Cup it's very, very difficult. But I think we can use this to change some in the Brazilian football. ""A lot of players play outside (of Brazil). Most of them play in Europe, but we have to change something organization in the soccer in Brazil. ""For me, the most important thing is the organization and the calendar. It's a lot of games, so the players can't play every game in a good shape. ""The level is a little bit down in this moment. Also, the youth team is not what (we're) used to being in Brazil, so we need to wake up."" Kaka hopes that many of his compatriots will keep up with the MLS and his career in Orlando now that he's exhibiting his much admired talents there. ""We have a Facebook page in Brazil, Orlando City Brazil, and a lot of fans (are) enjoying the page. A lot of Brazilians are looking here now,"" he said. ""I think this season will be great for us in Brazil. A lot of people will see the Orlando City playing in MLS."" And despite earlier talk of an extended international career and making World Cup 2018, there really is only one goal at the forefront of his mind. ""My goal is always to win. I hope one day I can win the league with Orlando City,"" he said. ""For this year, probably we want to arrive in the playoffs. Let's put the target a little bit down, but I still have ... this goal that we can win the league one day.""","Kaka gearing up to appear in the MLS for Orlando City .

"London (CNN)Mohammed Emwazi, the British-Kuwaiti ISIS fighter the world knows as ""Jihadi John,"" was fuming with righteous indignation when he met with a representative of Cage Prisoners -- a Muslim advocacy group now known as CAGE -- shortly after being deported from Tanzania in August 2009. In a meeting recorded by the advocacy group, he claimed his plans for a safari vacation were ruined when he was detained at the airport and sent back first to Amsterdam and then to Dover, England, where he was subjected to several interrogations by British security officials. He said they accused him of traveling to Tanzania so he could link up with the terrorist group Al-Shabaab in neighboring Somalia and revealed they had been listening in on his phone conversations even before he made the trip. Emwazi said that during the questioning he denied any connection to extremism and stated that innocent people had been killed in the 2005 London transport system terrorist attacks and that the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States were wrong. Father: No proof my son is 'Jihadi John' But more than a dozen British administrative court documents obtained by CNN paint a very different picture of Emwazi and explain why he was on British security services' radar before he made the trip. The documents reveal British security services believed Emwazi was part of a radical West London recruitment network for terrorist groups in East Africa. Last week, two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed to CNN that ""Jihadi John"" is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. One figure in the group -- a 30-year-old British-Iranian identified only as ""CE"" who was allegedly trained by al Qaeda terrorists in Somalia in 2006 -- was later placed under a ""control order,"" a British administrative measure to restrict the freedom of movement of terror suspects. A December 2011 court document pertaining to CE's case named Emwazi as part of his extremist network. According to the document, British Home Secretary Theresa May ""maintained she has reasonable grounds for suspicion that since his return to the United Kingdom in February 2007, CE has continued to associate regularly with members of a network of United Kingdom and East African-based Islamist extremists which is involved in the provision of funds and equipment to Somalia for terrorism-related purposes and the facilitation of individuals' travel from the United Kingdom to Somalia to undertake terrorism-related activity. The Secretary of State maintains that members of the network include BX, J1, Mohammed Ezzouek, Hamza Chentouf, Mohammed Emwazi, Mohammed Mekki, Mohammed Miah, Ahmed Hagi, Amin Addala, Aydarus Elmi, Sammy Al-Nagheeb, Bilal Berjawi and others."" Some of these men are now dead. Others are wanted. CE told British officials that Mekki and Emwazi often stopped by his wife's apartment. Several of the visits were in early 2011, according to the document. Many of the young men in this network grew up within a few blocks of Emwazi in West London. According to the court documents, security services believe five members of the group -- CE, Berjawi, BX, Ezzouek, Miah and Chentouf -- attended an al Qaeda training camp in Somalia in 2006 in which they may have been instructed in the use of explosives. The camp was run by two veteran al Qaeda operatives, Saleh Nabhan and Fazul Mohammed, who instructed the British group to return to the United Kingdom ""to carry out facilitation activities and to recruit individuals to work on behalf of al Qaeda and/or Al-Shabaab,"" according to the British government. Nabhan and Fazul Mohammed were the most-wanted al Qaeda operatives in Africa and, according to a 2009 U.S. State Department cable, their training camps offered far more advanced instruction than that offered by Al-Shabaab. Nabhan, a Kenyan operative, was suspected of playing a key operational role in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1998, as well as a bomb attack on a resort in Mombasa in 2002, and on the same day, a failed missile attack on an Israeli airliner taking off from Mombasa's airport. Fazul Mohammed, who was born on the Comoros Islands, was also suspected of playing a key role in the bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998.  He wrote in a 2009 memoir that Western recruits should be provided with training rather than instantly dispatched as suicide bombers within Somalia ""to build sleeping cells around the world."" Nabhan was killed in a U.S. Navy SEAL raid in September 2009 and Fazul Mohammed was killed in an ambush in Mogadishu in June 2011. Authorities recovered a document on a thumb drive found on his body -- probably authored by a British recruit -- proposing an attack on targets including Eton College and the five-star Dorchester and Ritz hotels in the United Kingdom, similar to the 2008 Mumbai, India, attacks that killed more than 160 people. The author proposed two months' training in Somalia for British and Western recruits selected for the attack, including target reconnaissance, hostage-taking, weapons and counter-surveillance. According to the court documents, at least one member of Emwazi's circle -- J1, a 36-year-old Ethiopian asylum seeker to the United Kingdom -- had links to the al Qaeda cell that attempted to bomb the London transport system on July 21, 2005, two weeks after bomb blasts on London Underground trains and buses killed 52 people and wounded 770. According to the British government, J1, a Christian convert to Islam known in Islamist circles as Abdul Shakur, contacted bomber Hussain Osman by phone on the morning of the July 21 attempted attack. In October 2009, two months after Emwazi's alleged aborted attempt to wage jihad possibly in Somalia, three members of his west London network -- Bilal Berjawi, Mohammed Sakr and Walla Eldin Rahman -- traveled to join the terrorist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia, according to the documents. British security officials estimate that a total of more than 100 British extremists traveled to join the group, according to published reports. The Lebanese-born Berjawi, from St. John's Wood in West London, swiftly rose to a senior position in Al-Shabaab and likely continued to work closely with the senior al Qaeda operative Fazul Mohammed, according to a profile by Raffaello Pantucci, the director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute. According to the UK court documents, Berjawi remained in contact with the radical network he and Emwazi belonged to in the United Kingdom while in Somalia. Berjawi and Sakr were killed in U.S. drone strikes in early 2012. It is possible one of them authored the blueprint for attacks on luxury London hotels found on Fazul Mohammed's body in Mogadishu the previous year. By 2013, Emwazi's West London radical network had a new cause célèbre: the jihad against the Assad regime in Syria. Drone strikes and infighting in Al-Shabaab had made life increasingly difficult for foreign fighters in Somalia. Two members of Emwazi's network managed to leave Britain despite being under ""terrorism prevention and investigation measures"" (TPIMs), which means the monitoring of terror suspects who can't be charged. Their current whereabouts are unknown, but one possibility is that they traveled to Syria. TPIMs were introduced by the British coalition government in 2012 to replace the previous control order system. According to Robin Simcox, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society who has conducted extensive research on control orders, the new system removed authorities' power to relocate terror suspects, making it easier for them to re-engage with their radical networks. Both of Emwazi's associates moved back to London and then fled the country. Ibrahim Magag -- a British-Somali man previously identified as ""BX"" under the control order regime -- fled in December 2012 after using scissors to cut through the strap of his GPS location monitoring device. British authorities believe he hailed a London taxi, and disappeared.  He had previously attended the training camp run by the senior al Qaeda operatives Nabhan and Fazul Mohammed in Somalia in 2006 and was involved in fund-raising for al Qaeda in East Africa, according to the court documents. In 2010, prior to the introduction of TPIMs, a British judge had ruled he was ""too dangerous to allow him to be in London for even a short period."" Nevertheless, the British secretary of state wrote in court documents that ""Magag is not considered to represent a direct threat to the British public. The TPIMs notice in this case was intended primarily to prevent fund-raising and overseas travel."" His whereabouts today?  Unknown. Mohammed Mohamed -- a Somali-born radical previously identified as ""CC"" -- went on the run in November 2013 after entering a west London mosque and removing his GPS monitoring device. Security cameras captured him leaving the mosque, disguised as a woman wearing a burqa. In 2008, Mohamed had traveled to Somalia, where Al-Shabaab provided him terrorist training. He was  detained in Somaliland in 2011 and deported to the UK. According to the court documents, he was involved in facilitating travel for others to Somalia and fund-raising for Al-Shabaab, and was planning attacks potentially against Western interests in Somaliland before his arrest. He remains wanted by British security. It's unknown if Magag or Mohamed rekindled their ties with Emwazi in London before leaving the country. In 2013, Emwazi himself traveled to Syria, joined ISIS, and began guarding Western hostages. In August 2014 he was dubbed ""Jihadi John"" -- the menacing, taunting, hooded face of ISIS -- when he orchestrated the brutal beheading of American journalist James Foley, the first of many victims murdered on camera.","The man now known as ""Jihadi John"" was on Britain's terror radar for several years .

"Atlanta  (CNN)A suburban Atlanta police officer is dead after an apparent ambush, while his colleague's life was spared by his radio. Fulton County Police officer Terence Green, 48, was killed Wednesday in Fairburn, Georgia. A second officer was shot in the hip, but suffered no injuries. ""It was actually his radio -- the bullet went through -- the radio saved him. It penetrated the radio,"" said Fulton Police Chief Cassandra Jones. The incident occurred when police were searching a neighborhood after reports of gunfire from the home of Amanuel Menghesha, 42. Menghesha allegedly fired at the officers without warning, authorities said.  He  ""appeared to have gone on a rampage,"" said Fulton County Assistant Chief Gary Stiles, who described it as an ""ambush."" Police said the officers were shot with an ""assault style rifle.""  Menghesha was then shot by other officers. Green was shot in the head and died at a local hospital. The suspect was transported to the same hospital, but his injuries do not appear to be life threatening. Charges are pending. The suspect was known to police, and had ""violent tendencies,"" Jones said. Police say weather and poor visibility also played a factor. There was dense fog in the area at the time of the incident. ""This is a call that I pray every night, every day, 10 times a day that I never get. And when you get it, you're not ready for it, but you have to lead and you have to go on because you have to stand there and be that strength for your officers, but it's one that you just can't even imagine,"" Jones said in a news conference.

"Boston (CNN)She knew something awful had happened. It was smoky and all she could hear were muffled screams. Her foot was turned sideways and her legs wouldn't work right. And her good friend, Krystle Campbell, was just lying there on the ground. Karen Rand -- she's Karen McWatters now -- dragged herself across the pavement. She wanted to get closer to Krystle so they could talk and take comfort from each other in the midst of so much chaos. ""I got close to her, "" she recalled. ""For some reason, I got close to her head and we put our faces together."" Krystle said that her legs hurt. They were the last words she'd speak. The two women held hands until Krystle's went limp. McWatters was the fifth witness of the first day of the terror trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of detonating pressure cooker bombs with his brother to punish the United States for policies they believe inflict suffering on Muslims. Three people were killed in the blasts: Campbell, a 29-year-old manager for a restaurant chain; Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy; and Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old grad student. More than 250 others were injured. And the first day of the trial -- after opening statements -- revolved around a number of survivors of the attack, who recounted in detail the chaos of that day. Prosecutors called them to the stand to paint a picture of the havoc and pain the bombings inflicted. Tsarnaev's attorneys chose not to cross-examine any of the survivors. McWatters fought her emotions as she looked at a photograph that showed her and her friend of eight years lying amid a heap of dazed and broken people. Their two faces, side by side, stand out among the jumble of limbs. Krystle's mouth is open, but she is very pale. ""I was really scared,"" McWatters testified, ""and I remember screaming for someone to help us. Everybody was screaming, everybody was screaming for help. It seemed like a long time before help got to us, but it probably wasn't."" By the time first responders reached Krystle, it was too late.  ""They were doing CPR on Krystle and I started to think she didn't make it,"" McWatters said. She grabbed her friend's cell phone and tucked it in her pocket. By the time she arrived at the hospital, shock had set in. She was confused. For a while, that phone led hospital staffers to believe she was Krystle Campbell. When Krystle's parents rushed to her bedside and saw she wasn't their daughter, they were heartbroken, McWatters said. Krystle's boyfriend recognized her and called her parents. Two days later, doctors told her they were taking her leg. Her body was broken, and it hurt like crazy, she said. But not as much as losing her friend. Campbell's death was the first to be described in detail at Tsarnaev's trial. But descriptions of the other two deaths at the marathon and the death of a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will come soon. There were runners conquering a 26.2-mile feat nearby, but Noah's attention was elsewhere, playing with rocks and pretending to be a scientist. The 5-year-old thought it was a very cool idea to handle the rocks, his mother, Rebekah Gregory, told jurors. Gregory recalled that she thought it lucky that Noah was happy playing scientist. The next thing she remembers is being hoisted and thrown back. Other witnesses used similar phrases: Blown through the air, deafening explosion, cries for help. Shane O'Hara, the manager at Marathon Sports, a running store near where the bombs went off, said it sounded like a loud cannon, followed by an instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows. O'Hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair. The decisions about whom to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunts him, he said. There were cries, sirens and screams, he said in answer to prosecutors' questions. He sniffled as a photo of the blown-out storefront was shown in the courtroom. He told the jury the plea he heard: ""Stay with me, stay with me."" Outside, Gregory tried to sit up, but could not rise much. ""My first instinct as a mother was where in the world was my baby, where was my son,"" Gregory said. She couldn't see her legs, but she saw her bones lying next to her on the sidewalk, she testified. ""At that point I thought that was the day I would die,"" she said. Gregory lifted her arms and her bones were sticking out of her flesh. Somehow, over the cacophony, she heard Noah calling for her. She wasn't imagining it. Colton Kilgore, who was also part of Gregory's group and another of Wednesday's witnesses, remembered the terrified boy looking for his mother. Boston Marathon bombing timeline . The day's testimony was dramatic and emotional, most likely as the prosecutors wanted it. Anyone who follows the news has seen footage of the bombings and read accounts of what happened. The power of the survivors' testimonies in the courtroom was in the details that made what some would call an unimaginable crime into something very real. They shared small memories, like what people said in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Gregory told the jury about how she knew Noah was being cared for. Then she focused on the tourniquet that was being twisted on her leg by aid-givers. ""We have an amputee,"" she saw one of them mouth. What they told her aloud was something along the lines of ""This is really, really bad, but we will help you."" Another survivor, Sydney Corcoran, testified that after the blasts -- which left her ears ringing ""just like leaving a concert"" -- she was hurt but didn't know that she was severely injured. She limped to a railing, grabbed it, and passed out, she said. Eyes open again shortly afterward, she found herself on her back, with a group of men applying pressure on her thigh, trying to figure out where she was bleeding. ""I remember a man putting his forehead to my head and telling me I'd be all right,"" she said. Corcoran was a senior in high school. After the one man told her she would be OK, another said he could see her eyes going white. ""I could feel my body going tingly and I was getting increasingly cold. I knew I was dying,"" she testified. In court, she was asked if she knew why she was feeling cold. ""I was dying. The blood was leaving my body. I was bleeding out,"" she answered. It felt like she was sliding into sleep. Almost peaceful, Corcoran said. Like she was going to go to sleep and fade away. Doctors saved the teen, but her life was not spared the pain of the attack. Corcoran awoke in a hospital and saw her father, she testified. Because she was intubated, she motioned for a pen and a paper and wrote a question for her father. Was her mother alive? ""Once he looked at what I'd written he started to cry,"" Corcoran told jurors. The father responded: ""She's OK, but her legs are gone."" CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston.

"(CNN)Southerners, don't pack your sweaters or heavy coats away just yet. You're probably going to need them for a few days. A cold front is headed across the country. Enjoy the warmth until it gets where you are, because after that temperatures are going to drop 20 degrees or more before you know it. And it's not just the South that will have to put up with the cold. Almost a third of the people in the United States are bundling up and looking up to the sky. Another widespread winter event was shaping up Wednesday afternoon, and it looks as if it will last through Thursday. About 92 million people are under some sort of winter weather warning, watch or advisory.  The wintery weather will eventually extend nearly 2,000 miles, from New Mexico to Massachusetts. For once, Boston won't be worried about a being a segment leader in snow totals. Looks likes that will be Kentucky, where some spots could see 6 to 10 inches. Other areas will have to worry about heavy rain dumped by the slow moving front. Cities in southeast Missouri, western Kentucky, northern Tennessee and western Pennsylvania might get 2 to 4 inches. Rain will transition to snowfall across many states as colder air pushes in behind the front as it moves to the southeast. The National Weather Service warned that flooding could be an issue, especially across the lower Ohio Valley and western Mid-Atlantic regions. CNN affiliate WCHS reported a mudslide in Mingo County resulted in one woman going to the hospital. There are concerns about ice and the potential for power outages. Arkansas, northern Mississippi and western Tennessee will get the brunt of the icy weather. Some areas could see more than a third of an inch of ice accumulation. Sleet and ice are expected to make things messy in the Dallas area. The precipitation was causing problems at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, where more than 630 arrivals and departures were canceled or delayed. Nationwide, more than 3,800 flights were delayed, according to the air traffic tracking website FlightAware. At least 1,750 were canceled. Things will be worse Thursday, at least as cancellations go. More than 2,000 flights with U.S. ties have been scrubbed. So far this season Boston has seen 105.7 inches -- almost 9 feet -- of snow. That's just 1.9 inches short of the record set nine years ago. More snow is expected from this system, but it's only likely to be 1 inch Wednesday as the forecast models indicate the majority of snow will stay south of the city. There is a slim chance of snow on Thursday, followed by days of sunshine and temperatures near 40 by Monday.

"(CNN)The maker of a controversial documentary about rape in India, Leslee Udwin, told CNN she is shocked by the Indian authorities' move to ban the film without even having seen it. The storm over ""India's Daughter"" blew up out of nowhere and is ""based on nothing,"" Udwin said, in an interview for CNN's ""The World Right Now with Hala Gorani."" ""The tragedy here is it's a missed opportunity for India to actually show by embracing the film... to show the world that India is as concerned as the rest of the world is to put gender inequality on the agenda,"" she said. The BBC documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case in New Delhi that sparked massive outrage and protests in India. An Indian court restricted the publication and airing of the film in India as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after comments by Mukesh Singh, the interviewed convict, were released in several media outlets. Singh appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night, according to the documentary. The government has also asked Google to remove excerpts of the film from video sharing site YouTube. A Google India spokeswoman, Paroma Roy Chowdhury, said it would comply on the Indian YouTube site, ""as we are required to do so by the local law."" A statement from the company read: ""While we believe that access to information is the foundation of a free society, and that services like YouTube help people express themselves and share different points of view, we continue to remove content that is illegal or violates our community guidelines, once notified."" Udwin told CNN the restrictions appear to have been motivated by fear of ""public disorder."" ""I presume they mean protests,"" she said. It was, in fact, the street protests, not the brutality of the crime, that first inspired Udwin to make the film. But Udwin, who spent 16 hours interviewing Singh in prison over the course of three days, said the experience was chilling. ""He told me everything that happened that night, he told me everything about his attitudes towards society, women, hanging, all sorts... He blamed her -- the society blames girls, the society itself,"" she said. ""Look here's the thing: All this hysteria... people must understand these men are products of a learned attitude. They are programmed, they are brainwashed. The society itself tells girls to stay indoors after dark."" Udwin said she had done everything she could to elicit a human response from Singh. She even had a list of the girl's horrific rape-inflicted injuries, from which she died, read to him in Hindi while she recorded his face. ""There were a few twitches but there was no remorse, there was no emotion, I don't think he is capable of emotion,"" she said. Singh, who was driving the bus on which the girl was attacked while traveling home from the movies with a male friend, is now on death row and has filed an appeal. But all Singh says about how he, and the other men convicted over the rape, have been treated is to ask why such a fuss is being made about them when ""everybody's doing it,"" Udwin said. At the heart of the matter, she said, is the issue of gender inequality. From birth, boys in India and many other countries are accorded a higher status than girls, so it's unsurprising that they go on to treat women as lesser beings. She compares gender inequality to a cancerous tumor that shows its spread through offenses against women. The dead girl's father, who is also interviewed in the film, explained that in order to send his daughter to medical college, he sold a piece of ancestral land -- a big deal in India, Udwin said. ""When he did that, his whole family was in revolt,"" said Udwin. ""They said, 'Why are you selling it to educate a girl?' ""Now that is a comment that is in the documentary, uttered by the father. Why is nobody saying to me, 'How dare you put that comment in the documentary'?"" In a statement, India's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview, which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage. But Udwin strongly rejected that claim. ""It would appear that the home minister has been utterly misinformed,"" she said. ""The permissions to interview this man were absolutely cast iron and all of the conditions imposed by them were obeyed by me and my team."" Udwin also speaks out for the ""massive swaths of Indian people who are so forward looking, who are so embracing of change and are agents of that change. ""There are extraordinary women's groups who have been working for generations towards this change. Those protests were so admirable -- that's what took me out there."" And she stresses that the issues of gender inequality and sexual violence against women are not confined to India. The film ends with a series of statistics on sexual violence from other countries, she said, including the United States and United Kingdom. This means that ""no viewer is is left off the hook at the end of the film in terms of thinking, 'This is something that happens to people over there.' This happens to us, to every country,"" Udwin said. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Documentary maker Leslee Udwin says she's shocked by Indian authorities' ban on showing her film .
She says the ban is a ""missed opportunity"" for India to show it cares about equality for women .

"(CNN)As many as 13 senior leaders of al-Nusra Front, including the terror group's military commander, were killed in two Syrian airstrikes Thursday, a Middle Eastern security source who was briefed by Syrian intelligence told CNN. Abu Hammam al Shami was among those killed in the strikes against al-Nusra, al Qaeda's largest affiliate in Syria, the source said. Syria's state news agency SANA also reported al Shami's death. The special operation that took place in Hobait, in Idlib province, was part of a wider effort by Syrian forces to destroy areas believed to be gathering points for al-Nusra militants around the province, according to SANA. According to a 2014 al-Nusra video, al Shami joined the group after years of training in Afghanistan and Iraq. Also killed in the northwestern province of Idlib was a senior Saudi operative in the group, the source said. There were initial indications that al-Nusra leader Abu Mohammed al Jolani was wounded in one of the strikes, the source said Thursday. But on Friday, the source told CNN the latest assessment of Syrian intelligence was that al Jolani was not injured. The strikes took place in the towns of Salqin and Hobait, both near the city of Saraqeb in Idlib. One strike targeted a meeting of senior al-Nusra Front leaders; the other was on a home being used as a base, the source said. A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition that is hitting ISIS targets in Syria said its planes weren't involved. ""Within the last 24 hours, we have not conducted any airstrikes within 200 miles of the province of Idlib,"" the spokesman said earlier Thursday. Al Shami was featured in a March 2014 video released by al-Nusra Front, in which he discussed his failed attempt to mediate between his militants and ISIS after rising tensions between the groups. The video included a biography by the group of al Shami, which was translated by the Long War Journal. It said that in the late 1990s, al Shami traveled to Afghanistan, where he was trained in a camp run by Abu Musab al Suri, a veteran Syrian jihadi strategist. Al Shami then trained in al Qaeda camps, where he met one of the 9/11 hijackers and personally swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden. By the time of the 9/11 attacks, al Shami had started to train recruits in Afghanistan and was named as the head of the Syrian jihadist contingent within al Qaeda. After the fall of the Taliban, he fled Afghanistan with senior Egyptian al Qaeda operative Sayf al Adel, the group said in the video. Al Shami began operating in Iraq, where he began working with al Qaeda in Iraq founder Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, conducting training for the group during the Iraqi insurgency, the al-Nusra video stated. In 2005, al Shami returned to Afghanistan for a short period, at the request of al Qaeda's leadership. When he got to the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, one of bin Laden's top deputies, Attiyah Abd al Rahman, tasked al Shami with leading al Qaeda efforts in Syria, but he was arrested as he traveled through Lebanon, according to the video, and was detained for five years. After being released, he found his way to Syria, where he joined al-Nusra, the group said. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","One of the 13 senior leaders killed was the al Qaeda affiliate's military commander, the source says .

"(CNN)NASCAR driver Kurt Busch will not be charged with domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Thursday, citing a lack of evidence. Busch was accused by Patricia Driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against the wall in his motor home at Dover International Speedway in September. ""After a thorough consideration of all of the available information about the case, it is determined that the admissible evidence and available witnesses would likely be insufficient to meet the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Busch committed a crime during the September 26th incident,"" Delaware Department of Justice public information officer Carl Kanefsky said in a statement. ""Likelihood of meeting that high burden of proof is the standard for prosecutors in bringing a case. For this reason, the Department of Justice will not pursue criminal charges in this case."" In a statement Thursday, Busch said he is grateful that the prosecutors decided not to file charges. ""I wish to thank my family, friends, fans, and race team who stood by me throughout this nightmare with their unwavering support,"" Busch said. ""Thanks also goes to my legal team for making sure that the truth got out and was fully provided to the prosecutors.  As I have said from the beginning, I did not commit domestic abuse. I look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life."" While Busch will not be charged, he must stay away from Driscoll for one year, a Kent County, Delaware, family court commissioner ruled in February. Driscoll had requested a no-contact order against Busch. Stemming from the family court ruling, NASCAR suspended Busch indefinitely shortly before the Daytona 500. That decision was upheld after appeal. CNN has reached out to NASCAR for an update on Busch's status but did not immediately hear back. ""Patricia and I are very disappointed that Kurt will not be prosecuted for the abusive acts he committed in September,"" Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice, said Thursday. ""The (attorney general's) decision, however, only makes the order that we received for protection from abuse that much more important. ""As you can see, in some cases, this is the only protection the victim will get. This civil no contact order is a critical tool for protecting victims."" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, previously has said that he would appeal the family court ruling and would continue to work to clear Busch's name. At the no-contact hearing, Busch testified that he believes Driscoll is a trained assassin for the U.S. government and that she once showed up wearing a gown covered in blood. Driscoll is a defense contractor and is authorized to carry weapons. McNeice has said that her client denies Busch's allegations.","Delaware Department of Justice won't pursue charges against NASCAR driver Kurt Busch .

"(CNN)Back in 2010 Britain's politicians broke new ground. They were long used to haranguing each other in the UK's rowdy House of Commons -- but they'd never had American style pre-election head-to-head debates. It is necessary and long-established political fare in the U.S. -- but over here in the UK, it was novel. It seemed to go well -- political points were scored, and polls were commissioned looking for advantages gained or lost. It was a drama of sorts, even though no knock-out punches were landed. Prime Minister David Cameron and his Conservative party won the election, but not by enough to go into government alone. For the past five years he's been governing in coalition with the UK's third party, the Liberal Democrats. And their leader, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, has mostly backed Cameron in Parliamentary debates against the opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband. Britain's broadcasters, keen to channel lively politics onto prime time TV and boost ratings, have been working the corridors of power themselves over the past year to try to nail down a repeat -- or two -- of the 2010 knockabout. What's at stake isn't just the proposed debates ahead of May's general election -- but the enshrining of such debates permanently into Britain's political architecture -- just like in the U.S. But while Cameron and Miliband have hired former White House election advisers to edge them in to the lead, no one can agree on what form a debate should take, how many there should be, or even who should be invited. Cameron has insisted on just one debate involving the leaders of seven leading UK parties -- giving equal airtime to the Greens, the Scottish Nationalists and the upstart rightwing UK Independence Party (UKIP), among others. But Miliband's Labour party is holding out for at least one head-to-head debate with Cameron. No one seems to be budging but both of the UK's largest parties could use the bump in the polls such a debate might bring. Part of the problem is the British electorate, which has changed since 2010, boosting the fortunes of some of the country's former political outliers. The rightwing UKIP, which has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union, has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of Cameron's Conservatives. In Scotland, the September independence referendum (which narrowly failed) so reinvigorated the Scottish National Party that they could hit what is usually a key Labour stronghold, undermining Miliband's bid for power. All of this has made the whole process of nailing down precisely who will be allowed in the debate that much more tortuous. For the big leaders who drive that conversation, it is about how each outlier can help them -- and hinder their rivals. It once looked like it would become as much of a British institution as rain, or fish and chips, but now the election debate seems in danger of not happening at all. On the upside, you can still tune in to House of Commons TV most days of the week to get your fix of one lawmaker bellowing at another. But do it soon -- I hear that even those everyday raucous exchanges are being scrutinized for being a bit old-fashioned.","Election TV debates only arrived in the UK in 2010 .

"(CNN)A new Justice Department report on Ferguson's police and courts could not be more clear: Change is needed. The 102-page report details widespread and systemic discrimination against blacks at the hands of officials -- painting probably the clearest picture yet of what the rule of law looks and feels like in the Missouri city. It includes 26 recommendations. The report is scathing in its critique, and clear about what needs to happen next, but it doesn't address the question: Who, if anyone, is responsible for what took place? Are individual officers to blame? Is the police chief? What about city officials who repeatedly pushed police to increase revenue through ticketing, resulting in disproportionate targeting of African-Americans? Writing for CNN, criminal defense attorney Mark O'Mara argues in favor of gutting the entire police department, and starting from scratch. So far, one person has been fired; two more are on administrative leave. Are more heads likely to roll? ""When the attorney general said that the Department of Justice has made certain recommendations, those aren't necessarily just recommendations. The Ferguson police department and municipal courts will have to reform. This is a must-do situation. We're talking about wholesale reform,"" said CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. ""And I would be very surprised that any of the leadership remains."" Mayor James Knowles said the two employees on leave are awaiting the results of an internal investigation. ""Department of Justice officials informed the city of Ferguson that a review of city emails uncovered explicit racial bias by three individuals who are employed by the city of Ferguson police department. Let me be clear: This type of behavior will not be tolerated in the Ferguson police department or in any department in the city of Ferguson,"" he told reporters Wednesday. ""The three individuals were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. One has since been terminated."" A source said the two employees ""will not survive the investigation."" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin criticized the mayor's response, seemingly suggesting that more needed to be done in the wake of the Justice Department report. ""You read this report, and, one officer loses his job? You know, you translate the bureaucratic gobbledygook of the mayor, that's all that happened there,"" he said. Surprisingly to some, controversial Police Chief Tom Jackson remains at the helm. So does Knowles. Although the report is limited to correcting action going forward, people affected by past abuses do have the option of filing civil lawsuits against specific individuals. Such cases are not easy to bring, according to Peter Joy, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. ""In a court of law, the findings of this report wouldn't even be admissible,"" he said. ""Basically, you'd have to prove each allegation."" Joy gave an example of person who paid a $100 fine that was unjustly levied. Finding lawyers who would take an individual case like that would be tough, he said, because there is no guarantee they could recover on behalf of their client, and the amount of damages could very widely. Practically, that person may be out of luck. But if the Justice Department gets its way, illegal or improper behavior on the part of police and courts in Ferguson could soon be a thing of the past. ""It is time for Ferguson's leaders to take immediate, wholesale and structural corrective action,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. ""The United States Department of Justice reserves all of its rights and abilities to force compliance and to implement basic change. Nothing is off the table."" CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","So far, one person has been fired; two more are on administrative leave .

"(CNN)The family of Michael Brown, the teen killed last year by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, will file a civil wrongful death lawsuit in the case ""very shortly,"" attorney Anthony Gray said Thursday. Neither he nor attorney Daryl Parks would say exactly when the suit would be filed, but they said that they disagreed with the grand jury's and the Justice Department's decisions not to charge Wilson in the shooting. ""They have accepted (Wilson's) self-defense,"" Parks told reporters. ""We do not accept his self-defense."" The slain teen's parents, Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden, were in attendance at the news conference but did not speak on advice of their attorneys, Parks said. ""The last 24 hours have been tough for them,"" he said. Word of the lawsuit comes a day after the Justice Department determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge Wilson in Brown's death but found in a separate investigation that the Ferguson Police Department showed a pattern of racial bias. Brown Sr. and McSpadden released a statement Wednesday saying they were disappointed that Wilson would not face charges, but, they added, the federal report on the police department could provide a silver lining. ""We are encouraged that the DOJ will hold the Ferguson Police Department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color,"" the statement said. ""It is our hope that through this action, true change will come not only in Ferguson, but around the country. If that change happens, our son's death will not have been in vain."" In November, a grand jury cleared Wilson and, in an uncharacteristic move in grand jury proceedings, the prosecutor released all the evidence that was considered. Gray said the civil lawsuit will rely on ""pretty much the same evidence,"" but it will be cast differently. The jury in the civil lawsuit will be asked to make a determination based on a lower burden of proof -- by a preponderance of evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, Parks said. Summing up the crux of the Brown family's case, Parks said, ""There were other alternatives available to (Wilson). He did not have to kill Michael Brown.""","Attorney says jury in civil lawsuit will make decision based on lower burden of proof .

The octopus grabbed it, took some selfies and then snapped a shot of Savard. Which, of course, brings to mind the epic battle last month between an octopus and crab on an Australian beach. This octopus at the Seattle Aquarium decided enough was enough last month and tried to escape its tank. Land creatures are not to be outdone, however.

"Hong Kong (CNN)A Canadian pastor, who went to North Korea on a humanitarian trip in late January, is being held in the reclusive Communist state, his family said early Thursday. The family of Rev. Hyeon Soo Lim said they received notice from Canadian officials that Pyongyang has confirmed that the pastor is being held. ""The Lim family and the church community is asking fellow Canadians and the international community to continue praying for his release and safe return home,"" a family spokeswoman said in a short emailed statement. Lim, 60, went to North Korea on a humanitarian trip as he had done over a hundred times before, said Lisa Pak, a spokeswoman for his church, based in Mississauga, Ontario. On January 30, Lim traveled to North Korea from China with a companion from the church who last spoke with him the following day. Lim was scheduled to return February 4 from what was described as a ""routine"" trip to Rajin, in northeastern North Korea, where his church supports a nursery, orphanage and nursing home, according to the Light Korean Presbyterian Church. In 1986, Lim immigrated to Canada from South Korea with his wife and son. He speaks fluent Korean and leads a 3,000-member church. Pak, the church's spokeswoman, said she doesn't believe Lim would have engaged in any type of proselytizing, which is prohibited in North Korea. ""He knows the language, he knows the nature of the government, so we don't see that as a legitimate reason that he would be detained,"" she said. ""We don't believe that's the way he would have behaved. He's very wise about that."" Previously, North Korea has detained Westerners on religious grounds. Cases include American Kenneth Bae, who was detained for two years after North Korea accused him of trying to bring down the government through religious activities. Bae was released in November. Another American, Jeffrey Fowle, was arrested after leaving a Bible at a club in North Korea and released after five months in detention. Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen sentenced to eight years of hard labor and believed to be a Christian activist, was released from North Korea in 2010 after a visit to Pyongyang by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.

"(CNN)One is a 21-year-old California man accused of trying to travel to Syria to join ISIS. Another, a 17-year-old Virginia student charged with helping recruit for the radical Islamist group. Charges against both were released Wednesday, and they are just the latest in a growing number of similar cases from the United States. More than 20,000 foreigners have gone to fight for ISIS, the terror group that controls portions of Iraq and Syria, experts have told Congress. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. It's unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. Here are some of their stories: . Arrested at George H.W. Bush Houston Intercontinental Airport before a flight to Europe, Wolfe was charged in June ""with attempting to provide material support to terrorists,"" authorities said. He ""planned to travel to the Middle East to provide his services to radical groups engaged in armed conflict in Syria,"" according to a complaint. On February 2, 2014, an undercover agent met with Wolfe and his wife and they watched a YouTube video about foreign fighters in Syria, officials said. Wolfe allegedly discussed the activities of ISIS, they said. The 18-year-old from Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, pleaded guilty at a Minneapolis federal court to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to ISIS . Yusuf was stopped by the FBI from boarding a flight to Turkey from Minneapolis/Saint Paul Airport in May. Yusuf and another man, Abdi Nur, were charged in late November with conspiring to aid ISIS. Conley's plan to join ISIS and serve as a nurse at a jihadist camp ended in September with a guilty plea on a terror charge in a Colorado federal court. Arrested in April, the 19-year-old was at Denver International Airport about to embark on a journey to Germany and eventually to an ISIS camp near the Turkish border. She told investigators she was going to Turkey to await word from her suitor, an ISIS member she met on the Internet, whom she planned to marry. The Cincinnati 20-year-old was on the FBI's radar for months as he posted about violent jihad on social media. The feds said they arrested him before he could hatch his alleged plot. Reminiscent of the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, he planned to set off pipe bombs at the U.S. Capitol, and when employees and lawmakers fled the building, he and an accomplice would shoot them, according to a criminal complaint. Cornell allegedly told an informant he had been in contact with people overseas, and that he had aligned himself with ISIS. The attack, according to the complaint, would be a way of supporting the extremist group. The Stoughton, Massachusetts, man was first placed on the FBI terror list for 2009 crimes but since has been suspected of joining ISIS, officials said. He's fluent in both English and Arabic, and if his college degree in computers is any indication, he has a way with technology. Then there's his interest in radical Islam. Put it all together, and authorities said former Boston resident and U.S. citizen Ahmad Abousamra could be a good fit inside the ISIS social media machine that's become renowned in recent weeks for spewing brutal propaganda across social media. The son of a Palestinian father and Italian-American mother, the 22-year-old from Vero Beach, Florida, is believed to be the first American suicide bomber to die in Syria. The former high school football playecr killed himself in May 2014 when he drove a truck full of explosives into a Syrian army position and detonated it, U.S. officials said. Three teenage girls who set out from a Denver suburb apparently bound for Syria to join extremists were sent home to their parents after they were stopped in Germany, U.S. officials said. The teens -- two sisters of Somali descent and a friend whose family is Sudanese, according to a Denver community leader -- were detained when their flight landed in Frankfurt on Friday after the FBI flagged their passports. The 21-year-old California man was arrested last summer, but was indicted on Wednesday. The FBI said he attempted to offer himself and material support to work under the direction and control of ISIS. His arraignment is scheduled for later this month. The 17-year-old Virginia student has been charged with helping recruit for ISIS, federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday. The teen lives in a suburb of Washington and is accused of helping a slightly older adult travel to Syria. The adult is believed to have joined ISIS there. The student is also accused of distributing ISIS messages. Arrested last month in New York and Florida, they are accused by the federal government of attempting to join ISIS and of fostering plans to kill the President and shoot law enforcement officers. The three men face charges that include attempting and conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. None were U.S. citizens, but Saidakhmetov, 19, and Juraboev, 24, had permanent resident status. Habibov, 30, was in the United States legally, but overstayed his visa, police said. The 20-year-old was charged with conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. Nur ""conspired to join ISIL and travel from Minnesota to the Middle East to engage in a campaign of terror,"" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin said in November, using another acronym for ISIS. Kahn was arrested at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in October. The 19-year-old is charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. In a letter to his parents, Kahn wrote that he was leaving the United States and on the way to join ISIS, court documents said. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. This 33-year-old man from New Hope, Minnesota, died in late August while fighting for ISIS, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. McCain's uncle said his nephew had gone to Syria to fight as a jihadi. The 19-year-old Somali-American woman slipped away from her parents in late August. She told them she was going to a bridal shower, but instead hopped a flight to Turkey and joined ISIS, Reuters reported. Another woman is suspected of helping her leave the country. U.S. authorities said he is an ISIS sympathizer.  Morgan was arrested on August 2 on arrival at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport from Frankfurt, Germany. A federal grand jury in North Carolina charged him with illegal weapons possession. The court documents make no mention of the ISIS connection, but U.S. officials said his Twitter postings support the terrorist group. Federal authorities accuse him of funding ISIS, trying to send jihadists to Syria to fight with the terrorist group and plotting to do some killing himself, by gunning down U.S. troops who had served in Iraq . The 30-year-old faces three counts of trying ""to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization"" (namely, ISIS), one count of attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States, two counts of having an unregistered firearm silencer and one for possessing guns or silencers ""in furtherance of a crime of violence,"" court documents say. The federal investigation into Elfgeeh began in early 2013, but he wasn't arrested until May 2014. Some 100 other Americans are believed to have either fought in Syria since 2011 or been arrested before they could get there, according to Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst. So far, no U.S. citizen involved in fighting or supporting ISIS or any other militant group has been charged with plotting to conduct an attack inside the United States, but that's the fear. Also, in none of the successful terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 -- such as the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013 or Maj. Nidal Hasan's massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009 -- did any of the convicted or alleged perpetrators receive training overseas. Former jihadist Mubin Shaikh said many of those who are attracted to ISIS or other militant causes are struggling to combine their Muslim and Western identities. ""When you're dealing with first-, second-, even third-generation individuals from various ethnic backgrounds, there are still problems of acculturation and integration,"" he said.  They ask:  ""Who am I supposed to be? "" That's the challenge mosques and Western governments will have to deal with, Shaikh said.","Growing numbers of Americans are attracted to ISIS .

"(CNN)A year later, it still sounds impossible: A sophisticated $270 million airliner carrying 239 people disappears, leaving very few clues about where it went. But did the tragedy of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 really have to be such a mystery? Maybe not. Lingering questions -- and the trauma experienced by friends and family of passengers and crew of the Boeing 777-200ER -- all might have been avoided if already proven technology had been put into place. Believe it or not, in our modern world, airplane tracking technology has yet to enter the 21st century. Take GPS for example. Why aren't air traffic controllers using it to constantly track all commercial airliners? How about communicating with satellites? Why don't all airliners stream their so-called black box data to satellites in real time? The technology is available. Yes, it's expensive, but so is searching hundreds of thousands of square miles of vast ocean. Let's break it down. Flight 370 had eight ways to communicate with the ground while in flight: . • Five very high frequency and high frequency radios that could transmit and receive voice and data transmissions. • Two transponders that could send identification and altitude data to air traffic control radar screens. • One satellite transceiver that could transmit and receive text messages and phone calls. Despite this technology, the world lost track of the flight with the airline industry codename MH370. To understand why, you first have to know a little about the technology and the gaps in the system. Throughout most of the world, air traffic controllers still track airplanes with radar -- which uses technology dating back to the 1940s. Radar is reliable, but it is limited. It comes with large gaps in coverage areas. Aircraft flying more than about 200 miles from land over oceans are not tracked by air traffic control radar screens. Radar covers only about 2% or 3% of the planet's surface, experts say. The rest is a virtual aviation no man's land. If an aircraft's transponders are turned off, an aircraft can be seen only through so-called primary radar. In these cases, air traffic controllers see only a blip on radar screens. The blip isn't identified and the plane's altitude is unknown. In a nutshell, here's the electronic communication from Flight 370 after it left Kuala Lumpur on March 8, 2014: . • Nearly 30 minutes after takeoff, the plane sends a text via satellite that confirms it's headed to Beijing, as expected. • Later, the plane sends a final radio call as it transitions between Malaysia air traffic controllers to controllers in Vietnam. But air traffic controllers in Ho Chi Minh City never heard from the crew. • Three minutes after the radio call, the plane's two transponders mysteriously cease transmitting. • But  primary radar operated by the military in Malaysia and Thailand is able to track the 777 for limited periods without its transponder being on. • Later, an orbiting satellite checks in with the plane's satellite transceiver, kind of like a cell tower pinging a mobile phone. The aircraft responds electronically --  ""shaking hands"" with the satellite. This provides evidence that Flight MH370 ended somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. All of these clues offer us only a few scraps of information that leave investigators with very little to go on. It leads them to an almost inescapable conclusion: Whatever happened on MH370 was likely deliberate, experts say. We might know more if the plane's transponders had remained active. In the wake of the tragedy, some called for airlines to modify their transponders to prevent anyone from being able to shut them off in flight. But many pilots oppose that idea as a safety issue. They want to be able to turn off any electrical system on board in case of a fire or other in-flight emergency. We might know more about what happened to MH370 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners, instead of radar. In the United States it's called the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen. An aircraft outfitted with this system determines its location using GPS and transmits that data back to controllers by radio -- which has a greater range than radar. The  technology is called Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, or ADS-B. It is the keystone component of NextGen. But still, when an aircraft flies over the ocean, it will be out of range. So the industry is testing a space-based system -- where planes would  determine their position via GPS satellites and report those coordinates via communication satellite network wherever they are in the world. There are numerous technical details that need to be worked out, but moving from spinning radar domes to orbiting satellites could eventually make blind spots in airliner tracking a thing of the past. Another emerging technology that might have helped us know more about what happened is called AFIRS, the Automated Flight Information Reporting System, developed by a Canadian company called FLYHT. AFIRS monitors what the flight data recorder, one of the so-called ""black boxes,"" is seeing. It starts transmitting key information automatically when it senses trouble or at the command of the flight crew or dispatchers on the ground. Canada's First Air is among the first airlines to equip its fleet with AFIRS, which costs $100,000 per plane. If all airliners were equipped this way, we could know a flight was in trouble even if the crew could not communicate by other means. It could make searching for the black boxes a thing of the past. In the months since MH370 was lost, international aviation authorities have moved toward tracking airliners more closely. The International Air Transport Association has announced new tracking mandates for member airlines, but there are no plans to require streaming data. And this week, Australia's air traffic control manager, Airservices Australia, announced a test partnership with Malaysia and Indonesia to track long-haul flights over remote ocean routes. They'll use satellite-based positioning technology to track flights at least every 15 minutes -- improving on the previous tracking rate of every 30 to 45 minutes, Airservices Australia said in a statement. ""The system can be increased to real time monitoring should an abnormal situation arise."" Would any of these improvements in airline communication technology have helped the world learn what happened to Flight 370? Possibly. Unfortunately, we may never know for sure. Although technology continues to shrink the planet in terms of communication, the tragedy offers a bitter reminder of how easy it still is to lose an entire airliner full of people.","Modern tracking technology might have helped solve the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 .
A year after MH370 vanished, airline tracking is still largely the same .
Most airliners use ground radar instead of satellites; tracking over oceans is spotty, at best ."
"(CNN)Archaeologists searching for a lost city in the jungles of Honduras have discovered the urban remains of what they believe is a vanished ancient civilization, National Geographic reports. A writer and photographer for the magazine accompanied a team of scientists to Honduras' Mosquitia region on the trail of a legendary ""White City"" or ""City of the Monkey God."" The expedition was launched after aerial light detection scanning  -- known as LIDAR -- uncovered what appeared to be man-made structures below the rainforest, National Geographic said. Seeking to confirm the discovery, a team of U.S. and Honduran archaeologists, a LIDAR engineer, an ethnobotanist, anthropologists and documentary filmmakers entered the remote region. They were protected by Honduran Special forces, the magazine said. Writer Douglas Preston said the team emerged February 25, after documenting the ruins of a ""vanished culture."" ""In contrast to the nearby Maya, this vanished culture has been scarcely studied and it remains virtually unknown. Archaeologists don't even have a name for it,"" Douglas wrote. Archaeologists no longer believed in the existence of a single ""White City,"" he said, instead believing there had been an entire civilization with many cities. The expedition found earth works, including an earthen pyramid as well as a collection of stone sculptures, thought to potentially have been burial offerings. Archaeologist Oscar Neil Cruz from the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH) estimated they dated from A.D. 1000 to 1400, Douglas wrote. The researchers were greeted by wildlife which appeared never before to have seen humans, wandering unafraid through their camp. ""This is clearly the most undisturbed rain forest in Central America. The importance of this place can't be overestimated,"" ethnobotanist Mark Plotkin told National Geographic. The team left their finds unexcavated and are keeping the exact location of the site secret in an attempt to prevent looting. But in his article, Douglas warned that that the area was nonetheless under threat, with illegal logging for cattle farming within a dozen miles. IHAH director Virgilio Paredes Trapero told National Geographic that the forest and valley could disappear within eight years unless action was taken. ""The Honduran government is committed to protecting this area, but doesn't have the money. We urgently need international support.""","National Geographic has announced the discovery of a lost city in the remote Honduran rainforest .

"(CNN)Blame Joshuah Purdy Brown. Or, if you prefer, P.T. Barnum. It's thanks to those 19th-century promoters that the elephant rose to become the circus's king of beasts -- the living symbol of ""The Greatest Show on Earth."" ""This is something that has been a big deal historically,"" says circus historian Janet Davis, an American studies professor at the University of Texas. Traditionally, she observes, elephants are the stars of the parade when circuses come to town. There was even a 19th-century phrase, ""to see the elephant,"" a euphemism used by soldiers for seeing battle, recognizing the wonder and rarity of these giant animals. On Thursday, Ringling Brothers, part of the Feld Entertainment firm, announced that it would be ending use of elephants by 2018. It's a startling change for the show, which has made the giant pachyderms a centerpiece of its presentation for decades and weathered criticism for their treatment from animal rights groups. CNNMoney: The Greatest Show on Earth will soon be without elephants . Brown was perhaps the first to make elephants a part of the circus atmosphere. The modern circus only dates back to around 1770, the invention of an Englishman named Philip Astley, who added jugglers, acrobats and clowns to his equestrian show. (The term ""circus"" comes from the ancient Romans, although the Roman version was closer to a sporting event featuring soldiers, and it could be quite bloody.) Astley's circus was such a huge success that he created one in Paris, and his students and acolytes -- knowing a good idea when they saw one -- brought the circus to other cities. To this day, the ringmaster wears elegant riding clothes because of the circus' equestrian roots. Brown, a shrewd marketer who was also responsible for making the circus a tented traveling show, added a ""menagerie"" to the event to help combat the form's sometimes seedy reputation. ""Circuses in this era were really for adults, and not marketed for children at all,"" says Davis. Brown's show, by adding a menagerie tent to the circus tent, could market their shows as educationally uplifting by ""showing people the wonders of the animal world,"" she adds. By the 1850s, elephants were regular circus attractions. Then came Barnum. In the early 1870s, the clever entrepreneur, who had made his fortune with such acts as the ""Feejee Mermaid,"" singer Jenny Lind and a New York-based museum of curiosities, created P.T. Barnum's Museum, Menagerie and Circus. ""They had exotic animals from the four corners of the earth, and you had to go through the menagerie first and then you went to your seat in the big top,"" Deborah Walk, curator of collections for the Ringling Museums, told PBS for a 2010 documentary called ""Circus."" ""There was no way to miss the menagerie -- it was all part of the educational outreach to get people to go to the show."" Barnum and his partner made the circus an efficient business, running it on the railroad to far-flung destinations and transporting their animals long distances. ""Elephants become this incredibly important signature part of the circus,"" says Davis. The beasts were huge attractions. When Barnum announced he was going to bring a white elephant back from Asia, a competitor whitewashed his own elephant and engaged in a media war. (The clash popularized the term ""white elephant."") Another Barnum purchase, the African elephant Jumbo, was the centerpiece of his circus, and when Jumbo died in 1885, the victim of a train accident, the news made worldwide headlines. The attitudes towards elephants, and circus animals in general, started changing in the early 20th century, says Davis. For one thing, until World War I, the circus was the king of the entertainment circuit: ""There were no movies, radio or television to compete with the wonders of the circus ring and little traffic congestion or parking problems to impede those who sought to attend,"" wrote Bob Brooke in History magazine. And in recent decades animal-rights activists have increasingly protested against the use of performing mammals such as elephants and killer whales, demanding better treatment for them. Ringling Brothers and other circus companies have dealt with numerous challenges over the last half-century, including ever-splintering attention for entertainment dollars and the rise of acrobat-based shows such as Cirque du Soleil, which is now a global empire. But ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" is still hugely popular, and Davis believes the loss of elephants won't affect the circus' bottom line. Still, she says, there is something special about the majestic animals. At a show she attended in 2013, the elephants had their own space, and a bunch of children were standing nearby, watching them in awe. ""It was very moving,"" she says. ""This physical proximity to these animals is powerful."" When it comes to circus animal acts, are more changes to come? Are lions and tigers next? Davis wonders. ""In a way, the elephant is kind of the bellwether animal. I would imagine this is a kind of catalyst,"" she says. ""I would imagine that we have not heard the last of the kind of changes that are afoot in terms of animals and circuses.""","Elephants have been symbolic of the circus since the 19th century .

Historian wonders if more changes are to come ."

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A man opposed to joint South Korean-U.S. military drills attacked the American ambassador in Seoul, slashing his face and arm as he was about to give a speech Thursday morning, authorities said. North Korea quickly called the stabbing a ""knife attack of justice"" and said it reflected ""anti-U.S. sentiment"" in South Korea. Authorities have obtained an arrest warrant for the knifing suspect, Kim Ki-Jong, an official at Seoul Central District Court said Friday. He was detained immediately after the attack, with authorities having time to formally arrest him or let him go. Kim, 55, who has a history of unpredictable behavior, could eventually be charged with attempted murder and other charges. A police official, Yoon Myeong-seong, also told reporters that Kim had previously visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007, and that authorities were ""intensively investigating"" a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and this attack. The U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert, was in stable condition after undergoing more than two hours of surgery, in which he got 80 stitches to his face. He will probably remain hospitalized for three to four days, said Dr. Jung Nam-shik at Yonsei Severance Hospital. In 2010, Kim received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea, according to the Yonhap news agency. The motive for his attack Thursday? He wanted an end to the South Korean-U.S. military drills to improve North-South relations, police said. The drills are held annually despite predictably harsh criticism from North Korea. The North Korean government believes the attack is ""just punishment for U.S. warmongers,"" according to its official news agency, KCNA. South Korean President Park Geun-hye, on the other hand, condemned it. ""This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador,"" she said, ""but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated."" U.S. diplomats have been attacked, killed in past . Lippert was attacked while attending an event organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which advocates peaceful reunification between the two Koreas. The U.S. Embassy did not request special security for the event, Seoul police said. Three police officers were on duty at the building's entrance, and 25 others were on standby. Kim sat down at a different table than Lippert, then got up and ran to the ambassador's right side yelling something that sounded like anti-American sentiments. ""When the man jumped on the ambassador, I stood up and jumped on the man, and they both fell on the ground,"" a witness, Jang Yoon Seok, told CNN affiliate YTN. ""Luckily I got on top of the man's back and could press him to the floor. Then others came to hold him on the floor."" Jang said he later saw the knife on the table. It had a wooden handle and did not look particularly sophisticated, he said. Seoul police said a knife, about 10 inches long, was used in the assault and the suspect brought it from home. Videos showed the suspect pinned on the floor, rolled into a blanket and carried out of the building. He was heard shouting, ""The South Korea-U.S. military drills must stop."" The drills began earlier this week. Explaining the joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises . After the attack, Lippert -- clutching his right cheek and holding a bloodied arm -- was photographed hurrying out of the Sejong Cultural Institute in central Seoul. The cut to his face runs from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw and is about 4 inches long and about an inch deep, Dr. Jung said. Fortunately, there was no damage to his facial nerve. Lippert also suffered five gashes in his left arm and hand, but he is not likely to have permanent damage to his arm function. ""The ambassador was very calm. People around him were taken aback, but he was very calm,"" said Dr. John Linton. ""He was speaking with his doctor on what to do. It was surprising."" As the ambassador left and headed to the hospital, investigators arrived, hoping to figure out exactly what happened. While there are videos showing what happened at the event, none of them will be from closed-circuit surveillance cameras, said Yoon, the Seoul police chief. The only such camera outside the building did help authorities determine exactly when Lippert and Kim came in. Was the attack part of a larger plot? Did Kim have any help, implicit or explicit? Not if you ask him, according to the Seoul police chief. ""Kim insists that this was done by himself,"" Yoon said. ""But police are still investigating if he acted alone and what his motive was."" Park, South Korea's President, told Lippert by phone that she was surprised and deeply troubled to hear about the attack -- an incident similar to one targeting her several years ago -- the Asian nation's Foreign Ministry said on its website. The South Korean leader vowed that authorities will ""take necessary measures ... with utmost seriousness and urgency"" to get to the bottom of the latest attack. She also promised to keep close ties with the United States ""so that the incident would not have any negative implications on the (South Korean)-U.S. alliance,""  according to the ministry. For Park's American counterpart, President Barack Obama, the attack is personal as well as political. That's because Lippert is a longtime friend and confidant, having been part of Obama's inner circle for years. Obama called Lippert ""to tell him that he and his wife Robyn are in his thoughts and prayers, and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said. Lippert has been close to Obama ever since he arrived in the Senate in 2005. Lippert worked with Obama on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and traveled the world with the then-senator as he garnered the foreign policy experience that helped pave the way for his presidential campaign. When Obama declared he would run for president in the 2008 race, Lippert was by his side again, and was on the road with the candidate and ultimately served as the chief foreign policy adviser for the Obama campaign. Obama nominated Lippert to serve as ambassador to South Korea last year. Thursday afternoon, Lippert tweeted that he was recuperating. ""Doing well & in great spirits! Robyn, Sejun, Grigsby & I - deeply moved by the support!"" he tweeted, referring to his wife, his son and his dog. ""Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK alliance!"" He then added in Korean, ""Let's work together!"" CNN's Judy Kwon, Paula Hancocks, Alexandra Jaffe, Stephen Collinson, Barbara Starr, Jim Acosta and journalist Hyoungjoo Choi contributed to this report.","Court: Authorities obtain an arrest warrant for the man suspected in the stabbing .

"(CNN)The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is making headlines again. On Wednesday, images began circulating from the city of Raqqa in Syria of a man being thrown off a building, allegedly after a conviction for a homosexual act. The scene is sickening and horrifying. And it's meant to be, because ISIS is not only killing individuals it accuses of homosexuality -- it is trying to spread terror among people who do not conform to traditional ideas about what women and men should look like, do, or say. This latest execution is the eighth that ISIS has claimed it carried out for sodomy. In addition, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has reported the murders of four more men, also accused of sodomy, who were killed in similar style by ISIS in Syria. ISIS is allegedly also responsible for stoning at least three women in Syria accused of adultery. It's clear that these chilling spectacles are staged with the intent to terrorize. Some of the men were photographed either being thrown from the tops of tall buildings or stoned or shot to death (and in some cases both). In its social media postings about the executions, ISIS shows victims being brought to a city center, with militants purporting to read from a self-styled ""court"" ruling before conducting the execution in front of a crowd. A final picture usually depicts a lifeless body. The militia's propaganda machine gathers local communities and posts images on social media with a clear intention: to warn against any kind of transgression and spread terror. The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), of course, condemns these acts. But it is also important to note that we have very little information on the executions themselves. Indeed, despite our efforts, and those of other independent observers, neither the accusations nor the exact nature, time, and location of the executions can be corroborated. We know nothing about the victims' sexual orientation or gender identity. Without evidence or independent confirmation, we must therefore be cautious about assuming anything about the individuals involved. Still, whatever the uncertainties in these individual cases, as IGLHRC and the women's rights organization MADRE have asserted, the public and gruesome nature of these executions, and ISIS's previous threats against those who commit what they deem to be ""sodomy,"" raise concerns for anyone in Iraq or Syria who does not conform to traditional ideas about ""proper"" women and men. And the reality is that these most recent executions are certain to heighten alarm and psychological suffering among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals -- and indeed terrorize the population generally -- in the areas under ISIS's control. For Iraqi individuals who are perceived to deviate from prevailing gender norms, living under the rule of ISIS means living with the constant shadow of a potential death sentence, as pointed out in our report with MADRE and the Baghdad-based Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq. Where do we go from here? There are no shortcuts or easy answers to stopping the violence of ISIS. The antidote to their bleak worldview will be long-term and hard-won, rooted in the tenacity and wisdom of resilient local communities. However, the international community must act urgently to protect lives and help those fleeing violence today. Internal and external resettlement of persecuted people should be stepped up with greater financial support to U.N. agencies and human rights NGOs who work directly with vulnerable people. Meanwhile, applications for asylum by persecuted individuals should be expedited. We cannot sit idly by while ISIS commits wanton violence in the name of protecting ""morality.""","ISIS images claim to show gay men being thrown off buildings .

"(CNN)With the discovery of a gray, fossilized jawbone in a remote corner of Ethiopia, a student at Arizona State University may have changed our understanding of our earliest ancestors. The partial lower jaw is the oldest known fossil evidence of the genus Homo, to which modern day humans belong, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Science. The jawbone has been dated to 2.8 million years ago -- which predates the previously known fossils of the Homo lineage by approximately 400,000 years, according to Arizona State University. Chalachew Seyoum, a graduate student from Ethiopia, came across the fossil -- the left side of a lower jaw with five teeth -- while on a field expedition in the Afar region of eastern Ethiopia in 2013. ""Honestly, it was an exciting moment,"" Seyoum said, according to a news release from the university. ""I had good experience in field surveying and knew where potential sediments are. I climbed up a little plateau and found this specimen right on the edge of the hill."" The age of the fossil means it could help fill in an important gap in our knowledge. Fossil found by fisherman may reveal new type of ancient human . It also means the Homo genus could have evolved nearly half a million years earlier than previously thought. Researchers have previously found fossil remains dating back 3 million years or more, such as the skeleton of ""Lucy,"" the famous 3.2 million-year-old remains of the species Australopithecus afarensis. Those remains were found in 1974 not far from the site of the latest discovery. Scientists have also found fossils that are 2.3 million years old and younger, which are in the genus Homo and are closer to modern day humans. But until now there has been little fossil evidence from the 700,000 years in between -- a crucial period in the evolution from hominids like Lucy to the Homo genus. ""The importance of the specimen is that it adds a data point to a period of time in our ancestry in which we have very little information,"" said William H. Kimbel, director of ASU's Institute of Human Origins, in the university's news release. ""This is a little piece of the puzzle that opens the door to new types of questions and field investigations that we can go after to try to find additional evidence to fill in this poorly known time period."" The jawbone, found in the Ledi-Geraru area of the Afar region, combines features seen in Australopithecus afarensis with those seen in later specimens of the Homo genus, according to the study. Professor Kaye Reed, of Arizona State University, said the discovery was the result of years of searching in the area. Surveying began in 2002, she said, but researchers only began to pick up fossils in the area where the jawbone was found in 2012, having realized the sediments there were old enough to yield Australopithecus afarensis specimens. ""Instead, we were rewarded with a much more exciting discovery,"" she said. Already the team has been able to establish that this early human ancestor walked on two legs and lived in a dry, arid climate, Reed said. Researchers are still working to determine what it ate and whether it used stone tools. ""It's an excellent case of a transitional fossil in a critical time period in human evolution,"" said Kimbel.

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Suspected Boko Haram gunmen shot dead and slit the throats of 68 people -- including children -- in an attack on a village in Nigeria's Borno state, according to survivors and vigilante sources. The attackers then burned down the entire village of Njaba, the sources said. Dozens of gunmen invaded the remote northeastern village before dawn Tuesday, singling out boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 19 and killing them alongside their parents, witnesses said. Njaba village lies about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Karimu Lawani, who escaped to Maiduguri after hiding with eight other people behind the barn of a neighbor, said the attackers came into the village at around 5 a.m. ""They shot dead anyone that tried to flee but spared children younger than 13 years old,"" Lawani said. He and other survivors counted the victims of the massacre before leaving the village some hours later. His account was supported by Faltama Bisika, 62, who lost four grandchildren in the attack. ""They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee. They particularly targeted teenagers and elderly people,"" Bisika said. News of the attack was slow to emerge due to lack of communication following destruction of cell phone towers in the region in previous Boko Haram attacks. ""I only got information of the attack on my village last night,"" said a civilian vigilante from Njaba who asked not to be named. The vigilante said his father was among those killed. The vigilante said he left Njaba for Maiduguri in June to join others fighting against the Islamist radical group. He said he believes the attackers came from Gwoza -- a town on Nigeria's mountainous border with Cameroon that Boko Haram seized last June -- because Njaba ""lies on the route to Gwoza from Maiduguri.""","Young victims in the village of Njaba, ages 13 to 19 were singled out for killing, witness says .

"(CNN)The photographs released by ISIS in its stronghold of Raqqa are dated March 2015.  The first ones show a large crowd, mostly men, but also among them a handful of women and children, all looking up. Three men on top of a building, faces covered in black balaclavas, stand on either side of their victim, while a fourth seems to be taking a photo or video. Their victim is thrown off the building. In the last photograph, he is seen face down, surrounded by a small crowd of men, most carrying weapons, some with rocks in their hands. The caption reads ""stoned to death."" The victim brutally killed because he was accused of being gay. There are at least half a dozen documented cases of men being similarly killed by ISIS. What's even more sickening for Nour, a gay Syrian man, is the onlookers' reaction. ""It's too much to watch, and people are just standing there in these images and watching, and they are not doing anything, and their facial expressions are really scary because they are not even scared of what is going on,"" says Nour, who's also an LGBT rights activist. ""They might be a little bit excited or maybe happy to get rid of homosexuals in the city."" Though in Istanbul, fear of persecution continues to haunt Nour, who asked us to conceal his identity as he waits and hopes for asylum in America and continues to campaign for rights for people who are LGBT -- lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans. As a teenager, over a decade ago, Nour suffered because of his sexuality. ""The worst bullying was at school,"" he remembers. ""I was approached in the street a number of times, verbally abused and sometimes physically abused."" There was no one to protect him. His family rejected his sexual orientation, his country criminalized it. Article 520 of the Syrian Penal Code of 1949 states: ""Any unnatural sexual intercourse shall be punished with a term of imprisonment of up to three years."" Nour left Syria in 2012, before ISIS took over huge swaths of the country, after seeing a video of two men being beheaded. According to the voice on the clip, they are accused of being spies.  Then toward the end, the voice speaks about ""shaking the throne of God."" ""Whenever we hear this in video or audio, we know that this is exactly meant for gay people,"" he says. ""It was the moment of clarity, the moment of understanding; this place is not safe anymore."" The pictures released by ISIS and other videos refer to gay men as the tribe of Lot, who, according to readings of the Quran and the hadith, or prophetic traditions, sinned by refusing Prophet Lot's call to cease their homosexual activity and led to the destruction of Sodom. One hadith states, ""When a man mounts another man, the throne of God shakes."" Since the revolution turned war in Syria, the situation for the nation's LGBT community has become even more dire. ""LGBT people in Syria need help, and they need to be supported. We tried to reach out to some groups, international entities, and they said that LGBT people in Syria are not our priority, and that would mean that our lives are not worthy for them to rescue,"" Nour says. This week, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, a nongovernmental organization based in New York, started ""Don't Turn Away,"" an awareness-raising campaign calling for action to protect LGBT Syrians and Iraqis from ISIS' merciless brutality. On its website, the group states, ""What is clear is the Islamic State's intent -- to spread terror among an already persecuted population in the region and to warn against any kind of 'moral' transgression."" The commission is calling on governments and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to expedite resettlement and refugee applications for LGBTs. Sami and his partner are among those waiting. Dressed in matching outfits, they already consider themselves married, laughing about how they first met online. They too, like Nour, don't want their identities revealed. When Sami's family found out about his relationship, he says, his brother tried to beat him up. He started to receive threatening phone calls from family and strangers. This past summer, while the couple was walking in the streets in Damascus, a car tried to run them over. ""I was able to pull myself away, but my husband couldn't,"" Sami recalls. ""The car hit his leg and he fell to the ground."" There is no doubt that it was a deliberate attempt to kill them. Two hours after the attack, Sami's phone rang. ""There was a man who said this time you could have made it, you could have survived, but the next time you will not."" The couple fled to Turkey a few months ago, but they can't shake the fear that their relationship could cost them their lives. They share housing with other Syrian refugees, where they have to continue to pretend that they are straight. When the ISIS photographs emerged, one of their housemates made a sickening comment. ""He made an absurd joke about how he was so amused, had too much fun watching homosexuals. He says now gay men can fly."" They say they will never return to Syria. And neither will Nour. ""It's too damaging for my psychological state, because I have been abused too much from my family, friends, school.  It's not safe for me psychologically or physically,"" he says.

"(CNN)In ""Game of Thrones,"" Yunkai might be a fictional city ruled by an oligarchy of slave merchants, but the scenes had to be filmed in the real world. The citadel of Ait-Ben-Haddou in Morocco near Ouarzazate (pronounced Wa-za-zat) was chosen as the location, and is one of the most popular film-making destinations in the region. And scenes set in the ancient city of Astapor, which was a big part of the final episode of season three, was filmed in Essaouira -- also in Morocco. But the creators of ""Game of Thrones"" were not the first to use the region's beauty as the backdrop for a major international production. More than a decade before them, Ridley Scott chose the North African country to film the gory glory of ancient Rome in his epic ""Gladiator"" starring Russell Crowe. And so did the producers of ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" which starred Jake Gyllenhaal. Indeed, big foreign productions seeking a Middle Eastern backdrop (and possibly an academy award) have long chosen Morocco for its relatively cheap price tag and safety -- and nearly half of the films shot in the kingdom are made in Ouarzazate. According to Amine Tazi, who runs two of the town's biggest studios, foreign directors come for the dramatic light as well as the wide variety of landscapes. But Morocco's appeal goes far beyond the beautiful vistas. Filmmakers can find experienced local crews that help productions save half the cost they'd pay in Europe or the U.S. ""Logistically, [Ouarzazate is] very good,"" says Tazi, general manager at Atlas & CLA Studios. ""Everything is very close by. Hotels are close by. People are very movie friendly and very efficient."" Tazi's studios also offer dozens of set options -- from Styrofoam Egyptian temples to plaster-cast Tibetan Palaces. National Geographic used one of his sets in the mini-series ""Killing Jesus"" -- the seven-week production was filmed by a crew of 250 people and included 4,500 extras. Bargain Hunting . Atlas Studios opened in 1983 to host the Michael Douglas classic ""The Jewel of the Nile.""  Since then, around 200 TV shows and films have been shot there, including ""Babel,"" starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. ""Morocco is one of the countries that goes out of its way to welcome film makers,"" says Tony Reeves, writer of the Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations. ""Technical crews in Morocco are well sought after -- builders, painters, extras, electrical resources."" But in recent years productions have been hit by the global financial crisis and the uncertainty following the Arab Spring which ripped through North Africa. Between 2008 and 2013, Tazi's revenue dropped by 50%. Such a slowdown hit Ouarzazate'seconomy, where many of the 100,000 citizens rely on the cinema industry from employment. ""The city is poor. There [are] few job opportunities,"" says resident Abdelaziz Bouydnayen, who once played Osama Bin Laden in a National Geographic  documentary. ""We are all just waiting...There are millions of dollars that come into this city, but the city is still poor."" In the past decade, both of the town's theaters have closed leaving residents without a place to watch the films shot in their back yard. Changing Times . Yet, a series of recent developments have started to show the start of a revival. Last year, 22 films used Tazi's studios -- up from 12 in 2013. Foreign film projects spent $120 million in 2014, according to the country's film commission  -- up from $23 million the previous year. And part of the reason filmmakers keep coming to Morocco are the tax-incentives -- foreign crews are exempt from paying value added tax. But the other reason is the experience of Moroccan talent. ""Making stories of biblical proportions requires that there be casts of hundreds"" says Roma Downey, who is producing the upcoming TV series ""A.D."" in Morocco. ""To wrangle that many people and have them be so focused and understand what they're doing is a big part of what they're doing.  It save time, saves money."" Tazi is so confident that the current boom will continue that he plans to build a brand new Roman-themed set this year. He's hoping to keep the cameras rolling and action going in Morocco's Hollywood. More from Marketplace Africa . Read this: Teenager brings poop power to Kenyan school .

"(CNN)ISIS has again destroyed cultural treasures, this time bulldozing the site of the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, the nation's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said. ""ISIS continues to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""They violated the ancient city of Nimrud and bulldozed its ancient ruins."" The extent of the damage wasn't immediately clear, according to Iraqi state broadcaster Iraqiya TV. ""Our ministry condemns these criminal acts,"" the statement said. ""Letting these lost gangs go without punishment will encourage them to destroy humanity's civilization, the Mesopotamian civilization, inflicting irreversible priceless damages and losses."" Photos: Precious monuments lost in conflicts . Nimrud was a city in the Assyrian kingdom, which flourished between 900 B.C. and 612 B.C. The archaeological site is south of Mosul in northern Iraq. The razing of Nimrud comes a week after a video showed ISIS militants using sledgehammers to obliterate stone sculptures and other centuries-old artifacts in the Mosul Museum. That museum held 173 original pieces of antiquity and was being readied for reopening when ISIS invaded Mosul in June, according to Qais Hussain Rashid, the antiquities ministry's director general of Iraqi museums, who spoke to Iraqiya TV last week. Nimrud and nearby Nineveh are the sites where two Assyrian kings, Sennacherib (704-681 B.C.) and Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 B.C.), recorded successful military campaigns on the walls of their palaces, according to the World Monuments Fund, a group dedicated to saving the world's most treasured places. ""Depicted in the reliefs are marauding troops in foreign lands, rendered in a style marked by lively action and attention paid to topographic and ethnographic detail,"" the fund's website says. ""The palaces of Sennacherib at Nineveh and Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud are vestiges of the political, cultural and artistic height of the Assyrian Empire. The remains of these palaces, the only Assyrian palaces left preserved and decorated with reliefs, are now protected against vandals and function as site museums where visitors can appreciate ancient wall reliefs in their original setting,"" the fund said in a website posting before this week's ISIS assault on Nimrud. King Ashurnasirpal II made Nimrud the royal seat and the military capital of Assyria, Encyclopedia Britannica's website says. Buildings at Nimrud ""have yielded thousands of carved ivories, mostly made in the 9th and 8th centuries B.C., now one of the richest collections of ivory in the world,"" the encyclopedia says. ISIS has destroyed other ancient and deeply meaningful sites in Iraq. Officials have said ISIS has blown up shrines such as the tomb of Jonah.

"(CNN)It was a sophisticated attack with sophisticated devices. Authorities quickly identified the Boston bombing suspects, but almost immediately after Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during the manhunt for the perpetrators and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured, investigators privately questioned if more people were involved. If there were others, perhaps a bomb maker is on the loose. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told police he and his brother built the bombs, but court documents show some people involved in the case had their doubts. The bombs were described as powerful pressure-cooker explosives controlled remotely. There were fuses from Christmas lights and detonators constructed from model car parts. The twin bombings in April 2013 killed three people and wounded more than 250 others. ""These relatively sophisticated devices would have been difficult for the Tsarnaevs to fabricate successfully without training or assistance from others,"" prosecutors wrote in a filing opposing a move by Tsarnaev's lawyer to throw out statements he made in the hospital. Two years after the attack Michael Marks, a former special agent for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, agrees on the technical aspects of the bombs. ""These were two relatively sophisticated devices that went off almost simultaneously. They had a very, very short delay,"" he said. ""It would be my opinion that they had somebody who was more of a skilled bomb maker, an engineer if you will, assist them in saying these are the steps you need to go through and then assemble the device to make it safely and to make it function the way they want."" They were the kind of bombs that need testing to make sure they work the way you expect. ""There has been no evidence that the two brothers actually tested and tried out making a bomb and detonating it,"" CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said. ""Now it could be luck that they put this thing together, put it at the Boston Marathon finish line, and were able to detonate them so close to each other and sequentially. But it was a pretty sophisticated attack."" Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told FBI agents he and his brother built the bombs following instructions from al Qaeda's Inspire magazine. No one has been publicly named as a possible co-conspirator. Investigators have focused on Tamerlan Tsarnaev's suspected ties to militants. In 2012 the older Tsarnaev spent six months in Russia. Authorities have questioned how much exposure he may have had to radicals and whether he could have received training there. There are other clues that the brothers would have needed help with the bombs. There wasn't trace evidence -- black powder from fireworks -- found in either home, their cars or anywhere associated with them, the court documents said. Also, investigators apparently were troubled that they recovered one remote-controlled detonator at the scene of the bombings when there should have been two. That suggested the other was being kept to use with other bombs. Marks said investigators didn't find circuit testers. ""You want a separate circuit tester in order to test the functionality of the components without it being hooked up to the actual device, for your own safety,"" he said. The trial underway in Boston will center on not whether Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did it, but why he did it. The prosecution will paint a portrait of a cruel co-conspirator, an equal partner in hideous crimes. A man who planned to kill and did. But the defense will draw the accused as a boy living in the shadow of a mastermind older brother. Younger, struggling in school, abandoned by his parents. An easy victim of deep manipulation. The question of how he was influenced is essential to the case. Kayyem, who said she believes the brothers acted in tandem without outside help, said she think the defense strategy will be to create enough doubt within the jurors' minds of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's mental state leading into this. ""So this idea that there might be some evil hand out there telling Dzhokhar what to do -- whether it's his brother or someone who's a bomb maker -- fits nicely into that narrative,"" she said.","Investigators have always wondered if more people were involved in the bombings than just the brothers .

"(CNN)Many years ago, a colleague told me how frustrated her husband was by ""Amazon Mom,"" a special membership program offered by the retail giant that provides discounts, recommendations and other information to help parents during the crazy toddler years. In bold print, the company says the program is ""open to anyone, whether you're a mom, dad, grandparent, or caretaker."" But still it is called ""Amazon Mom,"" irking my colleague's husband to no end since he was the one ordering the majority of diapers and other products for their babies. 'Dad' gets a makeover in Super Bowl ads . My friend's husband was not alone. A petition created a few years ago calls on Amazon to change the name of the program from ""Amazon Mom"" to ""Amazon Family."" But the drive didn't get much traction. That changed after the recent death of a beloved dad blogger, Oren Miller, who created a Facebook group for dad bloggers in 2012 that has grown to more than 1,000 members. In 2013, Miller called on men and women to sign the petition to get Amazon to change the name of the program. ""Why did Amazon bother changing the name of its parenting program when the program started in the UK? What made them realize they couldn't get away with calling it 'Amazon Mom,' and why do they get away with it here?"" Miller wrote. ""Someone actually started a petition to change the name to 'Amazon Family' in the US, and so far it has less than 100 signatures. Why is that? Why are we OK with letting England be more progressive than we are here when it comes to fatherhood? They have a queen! They are ruled by a freakin' queen! We can do better than that!"" he wrote. No more dumb old dad: Changing the bumbling father stereotype . I had the pleasure of interviewing Miller for a story last year on whether modern dads get enough credit. The 42-year-old stay-at-home father of two, who fought perceptions of fathers as nothing more than babysitters in essays on his blog, was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014. Miller, of Owings Mills, Maryland, died Saturday. Now, members of the dad blogging community are rallying in his honor, trying to step up the pressure on the Internet powerhouse to finally change the name of its program and get with the times. Mike Heenan, a stay-at-home father of two in Northern California and founder of the blog At-Home Dad Matters, never got to meet Miller but says that when Miller welcomed him into his community of dad bloggers, it changed his life. ""He got me writing again, inspired me to publish, to contribute, to tell my story ... to be a better dad for my daughters."" Heenan, like several other dad bloggers, took to Twitter using the #AmazonFamilyUS hashtag to call for Amazon to make the change. ""The push for inclusivity in the parenting arena has been well received by many a brand in the past few years and, like Oren, many of us think the change to 'Amazon Family' is a no-brainer,"" Heenan said. Judgy moms and dads face off in hit ad . Buzz Bishop, a father of two in Calgary, Alberta, and founder of the blog Dad Camp, points out how Amazon calls its program ""Amazon Family"" in Germany, Japan, Austria, France and Canada as well as the United Kingdom. ""So why is it called 'Amazon Mom' in America?"" Bishop wrote in a blog post. ""We are continuing a cause that was once championed by the creator of the Dad Bloggers Facebook group, Oren Miller,"" wrote Bishop. ""In his name, we want to finish the job."" The petition has gotten over 4,800 signatures. Amazon has not commented on the movement. In the meantime, Miller's supporters won't stop pushing. I hope they never do.

"(CNN)Australia lodged a formal complaint Friday over the treatment of two drug smugglers sentenced to death in Indonesia during their transfer to an island where they are expected to face execution. During the transfer, a senior Indonesian police officer was pictured in photos with the Australian pair on a flight. Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were being taken from Kerobokan prison in Bali to Nusakambangan island in Central Java, where they will be held in a maximum security facility before facing a 12-man firing squad. The date of the execution is not yet known, although the convicted will be informed at least 72 hours before they are put to death. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it had lodged a formal complaint with the Indonesian embassy in Canberra over the treatment of the prisoners during the transfer, which took place before dawn on Wednesday. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Australian media that an undue show of force, including armored vehicles and dozens of officers in helmets and balaclavas, was also used during the transfer. ""I just cannot comprehend it. They are two men who are described by their own prison governors as model citizens, two gentlemen who pose no risk to anyone,"" she told the ABC's AM program. ""I cannot comprehend the manner or the method of their transfer to the so-called execution island."" A spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the photos were taken without the consent of the officer involved,  Commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo. ""The officer was inquiring about the physical condition of Mr Chan,"" Arrmanatha Nasir told CNN in regard to one of the images. ""It is regretful that this photo is being used by the media to portray something more than what it really is."" Australia's complaint comes after Indonesia dismissed a last-minute proposal to save the pair's lives through a prisoner swap. Nasir told CNN that there are no Indonesian laws that would allow or provide for an exchange. ""Indonesia does not have legislation or laws or any other legal instruments that will enable the issue of a prisoner exchange to be conducted,"" he said, adding that the Australian government had been informed of this stance. Sukumaran and Chan, members of the so-called ""Bali Nine"" smuggling ring, have been held by Indonesian authorities for nearly a decade. They are expected to be held in a maximum security facility on Nusakambangan where they will be isolated before being put to death. They are among a number of people from different countries who are also scheduled for execution. Australian government and opposition parliamentarians attended a candlelight vigil at dawn Thursday, as a spectacular sunrise lit politicians from across Australia's political spectrum, united in opposition to the impending executions. ""We appeal to the Indonesian president to grant a stay of clemency,"" Bishop told the gathering. She reminded the Indonesian government that legal avenues remained open, before appealing for mercy on behalf of the convicted men's families. ""I've spoken to the families. They are going through an unimaginably difficult time and I ask that you think of the families who are praying that their son, brother, grandson can have their life spared. We appeal again to President Widodo, the leader of a strong and proud country, to show mercy and forgiveness and spare the lives of these two young Australians."" Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair. They have been jailed since April 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. OPINION: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said people should not let anger affect Australians' relationship with Indonesia. ""We abhor drug crime, but we abhor the death penalty. We think that these two Australians deserve to be punished, but they certainly don't deserve to be executed,"" he said. The Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Chan, 31, was called the ringleader of the plot, and Sukumaran was described as Chan's collaborator in the scheme. Seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences. Police caught four people at the Denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies. Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after a boarding a plane to Sydney -- he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot. The Indonesian administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two Australians against President Joko Widodo. The attorneys wanted a review of the president's decision to deny them clemency. Todung Mulya Lubis, who represents the pair, said a challenge had been submitted to the administrative court and lawyers were still waiting for a court summons. ""There should be no execution as long as there is a legal process going on,"" Lubis said. Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. Their rehabilitation is genuine, Bishop has previously said. ""Andrew and Myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve,"" she told the Australian Parliament in February. Indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers, and Widodo has made it clear he doesn't intend to introduce a policy of leniency. In December, six prisoners were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had ""severely affected"" relations with Indonesia. CNN's Steve Almasy, Camille Feanny and Jennifer Deaton contributed to this report.","Australia's Foreign Ministry lodges a complaint over the treatment of the two convicted men during a prisoner transfer .

"(CNN)Every time a snowstorm bears down on Danbury, Connecticut -- which has happened a lot this winter -- students and parents turn to Twitter to find out whether schools will be closed. They rarely get a straight answer. Instead, Danbury residents see jokes, meme-filled videos and teasing references to snow days at fictional high schools from ""Glee"" or ""Grease"" -- all courtesy of Mayor Mark Boughton, a social-media prankster whose @MayorMark account provides actual updates about school closings amid all the buffoonery. ""Attention: West Beverly Hills High School is closed for tomorrow. #90210,"" read one recent mayoral tweet. Boughton always gets around to the real news eventually. But first come the wisecracks. He was in especially rare form Tuesday night, tweeting almost a dozen snow-day jokes, Storify user and freelance journalist Kristin Hussey chronicled, as yet another storm hit Danbury. Parents and students tuning in for real news about snow days might find this running gag irritating. But on Twitter, at least, many students seem to get the joke. ""@MayorMark you better get each and every one of us a therapist after all of stress you're causing us,"" wrote one. ""The kids take it tongue in cheek. They understand, because it's sort of a tradition around here,"" said Boughton, who told CNN he's been trading jokes about snow days with students on Twitter for several years now. ""We go back and forth. But it's all in good fun."" One twist of the whole thing is that Boughton doesn't even make the call about closing Danbury schools. That decision is left to Superintendent of Schools Sal Pascarella, who confers with Boughton by phone and then sends an automated update to every parent's phone. But Boughton, who ran for governor of Connecticut last year and has 18,000 Twitter followers, usually posts his school-closing tweets first. Finally, after hours of build-up, the mayor gave people of Danbury the news at 6:21 a.m. Wednesday: Schools would open two hours late. The mayor says he wants to help young people engage with public servants -- and show them that he can be funny. ""I have a very serious policy side ... but I like to have a good chuckle,"" he said. ""That's who I am. In the end, I think it (social media) is about being yourself."" He says he rarely gets complaints about his Twitter feed, and that ""parents think it's hysterical."" But maybe not all Danbury parents. ""As a parent, has it been helpful? No,"" said Stephanie Pabon, whose 6-year-old son attends a Danbury magnet school.

"(CNN)A California man accused of trying to travel to Syria to join ISIS was indicted Wednesday, charged with attempting to support terror and other counts. Adam Dandach, 21, of Orange, California, was arrested July 3 and initially charged in a complaint of making false statements on a passport application with plans to fly from Orange County's John Wayne Airport to Istanbul, Turkey, and eventually reach Syria, the FBI said. Dandach was initially indicted in July on charges of making the false statements, and he pleaded not guilty, authorities said. But on Wednesday, a superseding indictment accused Dandach of attempting to provide himself and material support to work under the direction and control of ISIS, the FBI said. The new indictment accuses him of lying when applying for a replacement passport and then presenting the passport to an airline employee to travel to Istanbul, the FBI in Los Angeles said. Dandach is also accused of trying to obstruct the investigation by instructing a website administrator to delete his post history, authorities said. Virginia teen accused of being ISIS recruiter . Dandach, who is also known as ""Fadi Fadi Dandach,"" is scheduled to be arraigned March 16. Dandach and his attorney couldn't be immediately reach for comment Wednesday.

"(CNN)Patrick and Sue Ellen Kilgallon knew the storm was coming. They tried to get out of northern Kentucky on Wednesday night. Instead, they got stuck in the snow on Interstate 65. The Florida couple and their two dogs were still there Thursday morning,  more than 14 hours later, unable to get back to the Sunshine State. ""We're just sitting here praying, hoping to get out,"" Patrick Kilgallon told CNN on Thursday. They were among hundreds of motorists who had been stranded on I-65 near Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and on Interstate 24 near Paducah after a storm so intense that road crews just couldn't keep up. Gov. Steve Beshear said Thursday afternoon that some traffic had begun to inch along. ""We have finally cleared some emergency lanes on the sides of the roads, and the traffic now northbound on I-65 is beginning to move slowly and to clear out,"" he told CNN. ""It will take several hours to clear it out, because it's backed up so much. But it is moving again, thank goodness."" Video shot from news helicopters above the interstate showed that by 4 p.m., cars and many tractor-trailers were rolling along, once they cleared a hill near Elizabethtown. But in some places, the vehicles that still had gas had to maneuver around those that didn't. And Thursday evening, traffic was still at a standstill in Hart County between mile markers 71 and 74, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said. The Kentucky National Guard was helping motorists, taking some to nearby warming centers and returning others to their cars where the highways were passable, Lt. Col. Kirk Hilbrecht told CNN. 94 million Americans say: 'Enough with winter, already' Beshear told CNN that officials had been prepared. ""We did everything we could in advance,"" he said. There were no reports of any deaths or major injuries, the governor said. ""I-65 was literally a parking lot for 15 hours,"" said Rev. Janette Wilson, who was stuck on the highway while headed from Chicago to Selma, Alabama. ""The thing that troubles me the most was the lack of preparedness for the storm and the inability of the Kentucky emergency response team to investigate ... the impact on people on the road."" No one checked whether people had run out of food or gas, or gave those stranded an update, she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Wilson said they were stuck on the road and not moving between 2:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. A morning weather report indicated that over a 15-hour span, 21 inches of snow had fallen on Elizabethtown, about 50 miles south of Louisville. Other parts of Kentucky, along with parts of Ohio to the north and Tennessee to the south, had more than a foot of snow. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet published a hotline number for motorists stranded on the highway. The Kilgallons gassed up Wednesday night and tried to beat the storm as they traveled south for Florida. But 25 miles from Louisville, they hit ""nothing but dead stop"" on I-65. Kilgallon has a scanner in the car and said she has heard that a tractor-trailer collided with several cars, and while the truck was moved, there were not enough tow trucks to move the other vehicles involved in the accident. The Kilgallons had a few snacks left and are rationing the water they have left, Patrick Kilgallon said Thursday afternoon. They ran the engine on their new Jeep all night to keep warm and prevent the ice from encrusting the car too deeply, he said. Asked whether she was upset with Kentucky officials, Sue Ellen Kilgallon said no. ""I think they're doing the best they can,"" she said. ""I'd cry if it weren't so amusing.""

"(CNN)In the two years since ""Lean In"" became a best-seller and sparked countless conversations about gender equality, author Sheryl Sandberg says she has gotten one question over and over from men: What can they do? Now the Facebook chief operating officer is giving them some specific answers by aligning with one of the most popular athletes on the planet. If LeBron James is encouraging men to lean in for women, don't you think some of his 19 million Twitter followers will get the message too? That's certainly what Sandberg and her LeanIn.org colleagues are hoping, following their brand new partnership with the National Basketball Association and the Women's National Basketball Association and the creation of a public service campaign called #LeanInTogether. In a 30-second video of NBA and WNBA all-stars, we see James of the Cleveland Cavaliers holding up a poster, which says ""All-Star Dad."" Dwayne Wade of the Miami Heat says, ""When men lean in, everyone wins,"" and then touts how he leans in for his wife, mother and grandmother. ""Help women aim high,"" says Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks. The significance of the message and the men who are relaying it is twofold, says Sandberg. To truly bring about equality at home and at work, men need to be part of the discussion, and we need to bring the discussion to where men are, she says. Sheryl Sandberg at BlogHer: Not every woman has to be a CEO . ""The conversation about equality has long existed by women, for women, in women's forums where women are, and that will continue, and that's important. But bringing it to the center of the court, bringing men to the center of that conversation -- people like LeBron James and Steph Curry (of the Golden State Warriors) and Dwayne Wade, saying 'I'm in for equality and here's why' -- I think that could be transformative,"" said Sandberg in a phone interview. What Sandberg and LeanIn.org are also hoping to do is show men specifically what they can do, providing a series of tips about things they could start doing at home and at work, and as managers, as soon as they finish reading this story. Many of the suggestions might seem like common sense to many women -- such as male managers giving women credit in meetings and men sharing 50-50 in household and child care duties at home. But Sandberg says with the list of ""simple, clear, everyday things, practical things"" men can do that are based on real data, men will see not only how they can help but how they individually will benefit. For instance, research shows that boys and girls with a more involved father are healthier, mentally and physically, happier, have stronger emotional attachments and relationships, are at lower risk for substance abuse and are more successful at work and at home, Sandberg said. For girls, there's an extra benefit, she said. By age 14, if a girl sees her father doing child care and housework, her concept of the array of things she can do professionally is much broader than that of girls who don't see their fathers doing household chores, she said, pointing to a study by the University of British Columbia and published in a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. ""The way men react when you tell them children of more active fathers of any income level, no matter how active a mother is, do better -- a lot of men, particularly those with wives who are home (and who say) 'I'm covered. My kids are in good hands' ... they are motivated,"" said Sandberg. Despite 'Lean In,' workplace equality remains abysmal . Dads might think they are doing all they can by telling their daughters they can be anything they want, but if Mom is still doing all the cooking and cleaning, their girls aren't getting the full message. ""What really matters is seeing what you do. You have to walk the walk. She needs to see equality to believe it."" Another huge goal, Sandberg says, is showing men they won't lose out in the workplace when there is more equality in the executive suites and in boardrooms. ""If you've long been in the majority and long held power, and you see change, you could naturally be nervous that this wasn't going to help you,"" said Sandberg. Men need to realize it's not a zero sum game, she said. ""When companies do better, there are more jobs, more promotions, more salaries for everyone. When companies do worse, there's less for everyone,"" she said. She mentioned a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, which found that if women were in the workforce at the same percentage as men in the U.S., our country's gross domestic product would grow by 5%. ""We haven't seen 5% GDP growth in a long time. ... That's a lot of jobs for a lot of people, so understanding that this is beneficial for everyone, I think, is huge."" Work-life balance not just a women's issue . Sandberg's #LeanInTogether comes as emphasis seems to be growing on getting boys and men to think about gender equality. Sandberg will be one of the opening night speakers at a four-day conference on engaging men and boys that begins Thursday in New York. The conference is sponsored by The Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities at Stony Brook University. In January, a U.N. conference sponsored by Iceland and Suriname, which I was honored to attend as a panel participant, brought together ambassadors, other policymakers, and athletes and artists, with the goal of changing the discourse among men on gender equality. An overriding message repeated at the conference was that we can't keep telling men what to do. We need to show them what many men are already doing every day at home and at work. ""Dad' gets a makeover in Super Bowl ads . That is why the recent focus on caring dads in ads during this year's Super Bowl was so applauded by men like sociologist Michael Kimmel, who is spearheading this week's New York conference on men and masculinities. ""This provides a counternarrative to all the action hero, buffoon images that we see,"" Kimmel told me when I talked to him days before the Super Bowl. Kimmel said very few men, fewer than 10%, can relate to the way the media depict masculinity, according to a study conducted by Dove Men+Care. Kimmel was hired by the brand as an adviser to help analyze its research. Men today are spending far more time doing housework and helping with child care and are enjoying more egalitarian relationships than any generation in American history, and their ideas about what it means to be a man have begun to shift as well, said Kimmel, who is the author of more than 20 books including ""Manhood in America: A Cultural History."" Sandberg says we need to recognize and support the new definitions of masculinity and hopes the message from stars like James and Wade goes a long way toward doing that. ""I am increasingly convinced that unless we fully accept men as caregivers, we can't fully accept women as leaders,"" she said. ""We've got to stop calling it 'Mommy and me.' As long as we are calling it 'Mommy and me,' we are communicating to women that this is their job ... and we have to do both sides of this."" Admittedly impatient about gender equality (I'm impatient too!), Sandberg concedes we have a long way to go until the gender equality problem is solved and LeanIn.org can close its doors. ""We have been fighting for equality for too long,"" she said, noting that women starting earning about 50% of college degrees back in 1981. ""Thirty-four years is plenty of time to get 50% of the top jobs, and we're not close. We're at 5(%) in the Fortune 500. And so we have to change, we have to change more. We have to get more people involved."" Enter King James. Do you think NBA stars like LeBron Jones and Dwayne Wade can help encourage men to 'lean in'?

"Hong Kong (CNN)China says its military budget will increase by 10.1% in 2015, the latest in a series of double-digit increases that will narrow the still-significant gap with the United States on defense spending. According to a budget report released at the start of China's National People's Congress - the annual meeting of the country's rubber stamp parliament -- defense spending will total 887 billion yuan ($144.2 billion) this year. ""Building a solid national defense and strong armed forces is fundamental to safeguarding China's sovereignty,"" Premier Li Keqiang told thousands of delegates gathered in the cavernous Great Hall of the People in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The increase underscores China's intention to prioritize military spending even as economic growth slows. It also comes amid unease among China's neighbors about the pursuit of its territorial claims in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Traditionally, the People's Liberation Army army has been focused on protecting its own borders, but recent missions have seen it join U.N. peacekeeping efforts in places like South Sudan, and fighting piracy in Somalia. Analysts say that China's spending on defense is notoriously opaque and the budget includes paramilitary forces such as the People's Armed Police as well as the People's Liberation Army, Navy and Air Force. Paul Burton, Asia Pacific director at IHS Aerospace, Defence & Security, estimates that actual spending is 35% higher than the announced budget. ""China's expanding strategic reach and extensive modernization requirements will continue to require significant investment over the next decade,"" Burton said. China's defense budget is still dwarfed by what the U.S. spends on its military -- $598 billion, according to 2014 figures provided by IHS. But, while China's budget has increased by double digits every year since 2010, U.S. spending has declined since then. China's defense budget grew by 12.7% in 2011, 11.2% in 2012, and 10.7% in 2013, according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Alexander Neill, a senior fellow at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Singapore says China is likely to prioritize spending on its naval power -- its force has traditionally been focused on winning land battles. ""A growing chunk of budget is going toward China's navy, particularly its submarine force and its seaborne nuclear deterrent,"" he said. China's first aircraft carrier went into service in 2012 and a second is thought to be under construction. Neill also said that the PLA is likely to make its pay more competitive to attract higher quality recruits, such as college graduates. A U.S. congressional report released last month said that many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education. It added that the country's one-child policy, which has created the ""little emperor"" phenomenon of spoiled children, produces recruits who ""may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline,"" the report added. ""Serving in the military, in a Chinese cultural sense, is not a sought-after professional career,"" Neill said. ""If the PLA can offer competitive salaries, they may be able to attract a new stratum of specialist talent."" CNN's Jason Kwok designed the graphics in this report.","China says its military spending will increase by 10.1% in 2015 .

"Washington (CNN)A 17-year-old Virginia student has been charged with helping recruit for ISIS, federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday. The teen, whose name was not disclosed, was taken into custody last week, the officials said. Prosecutors are seeking to charge him as an adult but currently have charged him as a juvenile, one of the law enforcement officials said. The case remains under seal.  It was first reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday. The Post, citing officials and neighbors, reported that investigators spent more than a month watching the teen and his home before he was arrested. The teen, who lives in a Virginia suburb of Washington, is accused of helping a slightly older adult travel to Syria. The adult is believed to have joined ISIS there, a separate law enforcement official said. The teen is also accused of distributing ISIS messages to a network of contacts, one of the officials said. The teen is an ""intelligent kid,"" a man who hired him to write for a digital currency news website said Wednesday evening. Dustin O'Bryant, the editor of the website Coin Brief from Alabama, said: ""He did not come across as radical in any way."" The teen wrote freelance articles for the website for seven months last year. He was told not to bring religion into his writing, O'Bryant said, adding he had noticed the young man had written online posts about his faith. The teen complied, he said. The website editor said he was ""extremely, extremely surprised"" to learn of the arrest from reporters calling him. He hadn't spoken to the teen since February, when the young man said he was dealing with personal matters but wanted to start writing for the website again at some point this year. Give me two weeks to three months, the boy told him. O'Bryant said he is shocked by the charge. ""I hope there's some sort of misunderstanding here, and that he didn't know what he was doing,"" he said. He added that he didn't realize the teen was in high school because he had college courses on his resume. More than 20,000 foreigners have gone to fight for ISIS, the radical Islamist group that controls portions of Iraq and Syria, experts have told Congress. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. It's unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. It was also unknown if the man the teen allegedly helped is a U.S. citizen. The names: Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West . Others have been prevented from going there or providing support. Also Wednesday, a 21-year-old California man arrested last summer was indicted, changed with attempting to support terror and other counts. Adam Dandach, of Orange, California, was accused by the FBI in the indictment of attempting to provide himself and material support to work under the direction and control of ISIS. He will be arraigned March 16. California man accused of trying to join ISIS . In February, three men from New York -- Abdurasul Juraboev, 24; Akhror Saidakhmetov, 19; and Abror Habibov, 30 -- were arrested and charged with conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization. An unsealed criminal complaint accused one of the men of discussing a potential attempt to assassinate President Barack Obama. One had discussed hijacking a flight and handing it over to ISIS, the complaint said. Four women from Colorado have been accused of attempting to join ISIS. Three Denver teenagers, who investigators say were recruited via social media, were stopped in Germany in October and sent back to the United States. After being arrested in spring 2014, Shannon Maureen Conley was one of the first Americans sentenced for conspiracy to support ISIS. Two men who have appeared in horrific ISIS propaganda videos could be from the United States or Canada, according to analysts. The individuals, both of whom are shown wearing masks covering everything but their eyes, spoke in what sounded like North American accents. One was in a video entitled ""Flames of War,"" which shows the execution of a handful of men. The other militant is the speaker in ISIS' first propaganda video out of Libya, which ends with the graphic beheading of more than a dozen Egyptian Christians. CNN's Brian Todd and Pamela Brown reported from Washington. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz reported from New York.","Website boss tells CNN that teen didn't seem radical to him .

Allegations against the Lemon Township resident included burglary, kidnapping, domestic violence and criminal endangering, the Butler County Sheriff's Office posted in a message accompanying its post. Apparently not intent on going down without a fight, a man bearing the name Andrew Marcum responded to the post. ""I ain't tripping half of them don't even know me,"" he posted.

Jones raised the stakes by moving their pleas to Twitter. He posted a picture of a jail cell that apparently awaited the suspect.

"(CNN)Ben Carson suggested to CNN on Wednesday that prisons can turn straight people gay. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee called being gay a lifestyle choice, like drinking alcohol. I guess the next thing these two presumed 2016 presidential hopefuls will tell America is being black is a choice, too. Like it or not, it's no wonder Jeb Bush is emerging as the Republican Party's 2016 frontrunner. Of course, there is that awkward little name thing, something he seems fully aware of -- despite only being in the exploratory phase of a potential campaign, Jeb has already declared he's not just another Bush.  ""A lot of people know my dad, they know my brother. As in everybody's family, we're all a little different,"" he reportedly told a crowd in Las Vegas this week. And he seems to keep trying to distance himself from his family. ""Do you have brothers and sisters? Are you exactly the same?"" he insisted. Yet Jeb is banking hard on the same vault of donors and operatives his father George H. W Bush and his brother George W. Bush used in their presidential campaigns. He's already raising lots of money, asking donors recently not to give more than a still eye-popping $1 million to his super PAC. ""They didn't need to be persuaded,"" Howard Leach, a Republican fundraiser for Jeb, told the Washington Post. So, what exactly is in a name like Bush? Apparently, a whole lot of cash, which helps win presidential nominations and elections. And if Jeb wins the nomination in 2016, it will likely be less ""joyfully,"" as he promised last year, than ruthlessly. After all, we're still more than 18 months from the election and Jeb's locking in many of the same kinds of consultants that worked with his brother and father. ""Those who hold out can sense a distinct chill,"" noted a recent New York Times article. Jeb's campaign is seeking to hire ""donors, advisors and operatives,"" wrote the Times, with ""deep connections to the Bush family's past presidential campaigns and administrations."" Those same family members from whom Jeb swears he's different? And if consultants don't abide by Jeb's rules of loyalty and decide to work with other 2016 Republican aspirants? ""Swift rebuke follows,"" the Times notes, pointing to the example of IMGE, a technology company that reportedly fell out of favor with the Bush campaign after one of the firm's founders indicated IMGE was hoping not to be tied to a single candidate. None of this is to suggest that Jeb Bush doesn't have appeal as a candidate -- I like some of the things he did as Florida governor, like his record of cutting $19 billion in taxes and supporting school choice programs. (Although I'm not a fan of his willingness to grant illegal immigrants amnesty in any shape, fashion or form.) He seems more equipped to lead America and get things done than some others in the already cramped horse race like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who seems more concerned with telling people off than sounding presidential. Then there's Rick Santorum and Huckabee, caring Christian men, but both too consumed with running for president of morality than bringing the entire country together after years of Obama supposedly dividing us on race, religion and sexuality. But what troubles me a little about Bush's early attempts at ""corning the market"" is that he's relying on the same consultants that have cycled through the last 20-plus years of elections -- some of whom worked for Romney's campaign. This raises the question of why, if Jeb doesn't want the public to view him as just another Bush running for president, he seems to be relying on the Bush network of consultants? The same playbook that helped get his brother and father get elected president isn't going to work for this Bush. The demographics of the country have changed, but it seems unlikely the Republican Party and its operatives have changed with it. The truth is that any Republican candidate who wins the nomination will have to refrain from business as usual. He (let's face it, the GOP won't nominate a woman) will have to hire minorities and women in meaningful campaign positions and have a strategy to aggressively compete for minority votes. This is something Romney didn't do nearly enough of. Jeb is only in the ""pre-presidential"" phase, ruminating over the idea. But he appears to be assembling a lot of the same old (white) faces of recent losing Republican campaigns we've seen before. As a black conservative who would like to see a Republican in the White House again, I hope Jeb isn't Romney 2.0.","Crystal Wright: Jeb Bush emerging as GOP's 2016 frontrunner .

"(CNN)Australian cricket great Shane Warne has been criticized for promoting an unhealthy drinking culture, following post-match interviews at cricket's World Cup final in which he repeatedly quizzed players about their drinking plans. Acting as part of the commentary team for Australian broadcaster Channel Nine, Warne interviewed the victorious Australian players at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the wake of their comfortable win over New Zealand. Broadcast live and amplified throughout the stadium, the exchanges -- in which Warne seemed preoccupied with how much the players planned to drink -- prompted a backlash on social media using the hashtag ""#thirsty."" To wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, Warne asked: ""You feeling thirsty?"" He continued the theme with Steve Smith, asking: ""What about you, gonna have a bit of a drink tonight too Smitty? Gonna get thirsty as well? The boys are thirsty they seem."" Shane Watson and Josh Hazlewood were subjected to a similar line of questioning: . ""So what's the plan, besides lots of drink and that, how long's that gonna last? Just one night, two nights?"" asked Warne. The comments sparked an immediate reaction on Twitter, with users criticizing Warne for setting a poor example to young cricket fans, and one labeling him a ""bogan"" -- Australasian slang for an unsophisticated person -- for his line of questioning. Some Twitter users played on Warne's publicized fondness for the Tinder dating app, which has seen the former cricketer hit the headlines in recent times. Not all responses were critical, with British journalist Piers Morgan among those coming to Warne's defense. Warne, a noted bon vivant who was often photographed with drink in hand after wins during his playing days, took to Twitter to tell his detractors to ""get stuffed."" Warne's interviews provoked further discussion on Australian television Monday when, on the ""Today"" show, Channel Nine presenter David Campbell criticized the example he set. ""I hate this,"" he said. ""There is a stadium full of young men and women who look up to these guys, and it would have been nice if one of those cricketers was accountable enough to say 'Nothing will be better than what I did on this field, Warnie'."" ""We can't sit around here... going 'We have a drinking problem' and then sit there and celebrate that."" The boozy indiscretions of professional athletes often make the news in Australia, although players from the footballing codes of rugby union, rugby league and Australian rules are more commonly in the spotlight. Members of the successful Australian team partied late into the night Sunday, with coach Darren Lehmann tweeting a picture of team members celebrating in their uniforms as the sun came up, with drinks in hand. Warne's inquiries about the team's plans to celebrate were apparently not in vain. At about 3 a.m. he posted a picture on Instagram of himself holding the World Cup trophy alongside Australian captain Michael Clarke, the latter with a drink at his side.","Australian cricket legend Shane Warne is criticized for post-match interview questions .

"(CNN)Daniel von Bargen, the talented character actor perhaps best known for playing George Costanza's imbecilic boss Mr. Kruger during the last season of ""Seinfeld,"" has died. He was 64. Von Bargen, who also stood out as Commandant Edwin Spangler on the ABC sitcom ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" died Sunday after a long illness, his friend, actor Bob Colonna, said. Cincinnati TV station WLWT also reported the news. Other details of his death were not known. In February 2012, von Bargen was seriously injured when he shot himself in the temple in an apparent suicide attempt, distraught because he had been battling diabetes and was set to have two toes removed. The versatile von Bargen rose from the dead as the satanic Nix in the Clive Barker horror film ""Lord of Illusions"" (1995); played a futuristic sheriff in ""The Postman"" (1997), directed by and starring Kevin Costner; and portrayed a Southern lawman who pursued George Clooney's character in the Coen brothers' ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000). The Hollywood Reporter: Bruce Sinofsky, Oscar-nominated director, dies at 58 . An expert at playing authority figures, von Bargen was a member of the Air Force on NBC's ""The West Wing"" and in the 1996 film ""Broken Arrow,"" a SWAT communicator in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991), a cop in ""Basic Instinct"" (1992) and ""Super Troopers"" (2001), a secret service agent in ""I.Q.""

"(CNN)The President repeated an unfortunate and ill-fated claim while campaigning hard for Obamacare. You remember it. ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" With that false sloganeering, Barack Obama made sure he thoroughly owned a piece of the scorn spawned every time an insurance company changed or canceled plans after the ACA became law. Bad move. He's apologized, but history will record the affair as his ""Read my lips, no new taxes"" moment . Yet, there are worse moves politicians can make. Republicans are making one now. Republican leaders are stepping up to offer woefully inadequate stand-ins for Obamacare. They're offering these salves because they're hoping the Supreme Court issues a death blow to the federal exchanges that are now facilitating health coverage in 37 states and they want to have a possible alternative. There is plenty of potential the case, King v. Burwell, will succeed in halting the insurance subsidies that federal exchanges require to function. The Republican leadership is smart. They understand some of the anxiety already percolating up now could transform into a true panic. But in trying to contain fear, they're guaranteeing they'll own the anger that comes next. A collection of three congressmen, including Senate Finance committee chair Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), recently acknowledged the dire need for an alternative in the wake of Obamacare's demise and issued a ""blueprint"" that nods toward some of the key concepts. Rather than subsidize the cost of heavily regulated insurance plans, this proposal would free up the market more, including more price variability, and offer tax credits to help defray the cost for people making up to three times the poverty level. In place of Medicaid expansion, the Republican plan would cap the federal Medicaid support, linking it to the Consumer Price Index. The plan effectively kills universal access by offering people a one-time chance to sign up for coverage, and it doesn't require that anyone obtain coverage, making the individual insurance market unsustainable yet again as primarily those who already know they're in ill health will flood the market and premiums will become unaffordable. If anything, the massive outreach campaigns required to push traffic to HealthCare.gov demonstrate the difficulty in getting young, healthy people to act in their own best interests. While this outline potentially salvaged some semblance of the broad health care access the ACA is achieving, Senator Hatch showed his hand with a subsequent Washington Post op-ed he shared with two other senators. Insisting that ""Republicans have a plan to help Americans harmed by the Administration's actions,"" you might be forgiven if you didn't realize the harm was simply enforcing one's civic duty to purchase affordable health insurance. Instead, Hatch and his colleagues hope to soften the blow by offering a transitional period so that marketplace health plans aren't immediately canceled after the Supreme Court issues its ruling, expected in June. The senators would generously allow states to develop their own plans, something only the intellectual powerhouse of Massachusetts managed to accomplish prior to the ACA. With most of the affected 37 states having one or more government branches controlled by a party that preferred the status quo prior to the ACA, such state-level innovation isn't likely. Louisiana governor and distant Republican presidential hopeful Bobby Jindal advocates a starker response: let's roll out the welcome mat for the apocalypse. He argues that canceling the subsidies in all 50 states would reduce taxes by $48 billion, so canceling them in 37 states is a great start. Jindal actually thinks the Supreme Court's potential decision against the ACA presents Republicans with an electoral ""solution"" -- the chance to bask in the glory earned by a massive tax cut. The White House got a bit desperate in the run up to Obamacare, that much is clear from the poor vetting they applied to President's own stock stump speeches. Beyond his unclear rhetoric, they pushed the law through both chambers of Congress hurriedly and didn't allow it to receive the normal careful editing and revisions in a joint committee. The President leaped to sign the bill, warts and all, as it very well could have flitted away altogether. Now one of those warts has turned cancerous. It surprised everyone involved with debating and covering the ACA at the time of its passage, including the lawyers behind this suit, to learn the bill erroneously specifies only state-run exchanges can dole out subsidies. Yet in their giddiness over the law's potential demise over its own inconsistencies, the Republicans are getting sloppy too. The case is driven by a small nonprofit outfit called the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which while it has tentacles throughout the Republican establishment, means that the case itself, at one point, couldn't be blamed as the GOP's own strategy. But now that multiple Republican leaders have stepped up to offer these farfetched fix-it plans, and several leaders have even supplied the court with amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs, there's simply no separating the GOP itself from the Supreme Court's decision in King v. Burwell. Republicans aren't promising that you can keep your plan if you like it. They're promising, that for millions of Americans now receiving their health care through the federal marketplace, you won't be able to keep any plan at all. Over 9 million people would lose health insurance altogether if the plaintiffs win in King v. Burwell, and many more will suffer due to the destabilized markets that in many cases will shut down altogether as rates skyrocket and insurers pull out. None of the Republican plans can realistically come together to fill the gap anytime soon, so a gulf will emerge between states with the political will to operate their own exchanges and the red and purple states that don't have such fortitude. We suffered a rocky transition into the ACA, no question, but hospital systems, providers and patients are just now getting the lay of the land. We are seeing some great advantages, particularly in fields like mine. In rehabilitation medicine, we're seeing that serious injuries that once blocked access to insurance are no longer a barrier. The White House isn't making the mistake of owning what comes next. They're frank: there are no contingency plans. Republicans, apparently, want to own the next wave of insurance cancellations, while refusing to make a simple edit to a bill that for once guaranteed health care for the poor, injured and disabled. So be it -- 2016 is in sight.","Ford Vox: Democrats made errors in rush for Obamacare, but provided wide public access .

"(CNN)After months racing not only to treat Ebola but to find ways to prevent it, health authorities will launch a vaccination campaign Saturday in one of the areas that has been most devastated by the disease. The trial, using vaccines developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, will be administered in Basse Guinee, a region that has had the highest number of Ebola cases in Guinea. Another vaccine will be tested in a subsequent study, according to a press release from the World Health Organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. ""We have worked hard to reach this point,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said. ""... If a vaccine is found effective, it will be the first preventive tool against Ebola in history."" Patient Zero -- i.e. the first case in the current Ebola outbreak -- is thought to be a 2-year-old Guinean boy who contracted the virus in December 2013 and died a few days later. Since then, the vast majority of the more than 23,900 cases and more than 9,800 deaths reported by WHO have come in Guinea and neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are new Ebola cases every day, including 132 in the last week of February (which is up from 99 reported the previous week). While Liberia didn't have any of these new incidences, Guinea did -- especially in Forecariah and Conakry. Still, authorities in Africa and their partners around the world have had significant successes generally in combating the deadly disease. The progress -- as measured in the rate of new cases, with January's incidences being the lowest in seven months -- has been so significant that health authorities' focus has shifted from slowing the spread to ending the epidemic. This positive movement has come as a result of steps like better disease control, public awareness campaigns and attention to burial practices. But the tool that has been used to eradicate many other contagious diseases -- vaccines -- has been elusive. That's why, over the past six months, WHO has been working with scientists, ethicists and policymakers to try to create both better treatment therapies and a vaccine that will stop people for getting Ebola in the first place. Health workers in the Guinea trial will start with a new Ebola case and then trace all of that patient's contacts, giving each of them the option of getting vaccinated. John-Arne Rottingen, from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said this program is happening at the request of Guinean authorities and called the participation of residents there ""vital"" to its success. ""The Ebola epidemic shows signs of receding but we cannot let our guard down until we reach zero cases,"" WHO official Marie-Paule Kieny said. ""An effective vaccine to control current flare-ups could be the game-changer to finally end this epidemic and an insurance policy for any future ones.""","WHO leader: This vaccine could be ""the first preventive tool against Ebola in history""

"(CNN)Foreign intervention in Yemen's chaos has dramatically raised the stakes in the Arabian Peninsula, threatening to expand what is already a civil war into a conflict pitting Iran against Saudi Arabia and an Arab coalition. The Saudis launched Operation ""Decisive Storm"" last Wednesday with dozens of airstrikes in an effort to blunt the advance of Houthi militia and allied army units on the port of Aden -- and to protect the last bastion of Yemen's internationally-recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. There were also strikes in and around the capital, Sanaa, which resumed early Monday. Many analysts were surprised at the speed and scale of the Saudi air campaign, which the Kingdom said would continue until the Houthis -- a Shia minority that has swept across the country in the last six months -- retreated and laid down their arms. Essentially the Saudis are trying to bomb the Houthis to the negotiating table. The Houthis have responded by threatening a campaign of suicide bomb attacks inside Saudi Arabia. Iran, which has supported the Houthis as fellow Shia, described the Saudi offensive as a ""dangerous move that would kill any chance at peaceful resolution of the crisis."" Yemen is becoming the latest battleground in a contest for regional superiority between Saudi Arabia and Iran that goes back to the overthrow of the Shah during Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979. It now resembles Syria, or Bosnia 20 years ago: a patchwork of shifting fiefdoms where force is the only means of influence. There is a real risk that Yemen will collapse as a state, with a revived independence movement in the south, the Houthis in the north, and the Sunni heartland in between. Adam Baron, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and expert on Yemen's tortured recent history, says, ""It's not difficult to divine Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners' motivations for taking this action."" The Houthis were on the verge of overrunning Aden, a strategic port that overlooks straits through which 20,000 merchant ships pass every year. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, 3.8 million barrels of oil a day passed through the Bab el Mandab Straits in 2013. But Baron believes the Kingdom's ""decision to launch a full-scale military action truly risks inflaming the situation further. It will be seen as an act of aggression by most Yemenis and risks taking the situation to a place that no-one will be able to control."" As in Afghanistan, factions in Yemen do not respond well to foreign intervention. In 2009 the Saudis took military action against the Houthis in support of then President Ali Abdullah Saleh, using airstrikes and special forces, but were unable to subdue them. Now the Houthis have at least some of the $500 million in military equipment provided by the U.S. to Yemen since 2010, and they have proved to be capable fighters. They staged a lightning invasion of the capital, Sanaa, last September, taking advantage of popular discontent and an unwillingness among many army units to resist them. Since then they have moved on the Red Sea port of Hodeida and surged south toward Aden. They have also grafted themselves onto parts of the army in the battle against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) that is now raging in central and southern Yemen. Whether Saudi and Egyptian ground forces will become involved in the conflict is the big unknown. An Arab League summit in Egypt at the weekend agreed to form a joint military force, but that will take months at least to build. In the meantime, Saudi tanks and armor have been moved closer to the Yemeni border, but Saudi officials say there are no immediate plans to launch a ground offensive. Yemen has history as a graveyard of foreign forces. In the 1960s Egypt intervened in Yemen's civil war on behalf of the anti-royalists -- an operation that sapped the Egyptian army and contributed to its failure against the Israelis in the 1967 war. The extent of the Houthis' backing from Iran is hotly disputed. President Hadi said at the weekend that Iran was behind Yemen's turmoil and the Houthis were no more than its stooges. The Houthis deny receiving help from Iran, but as the conflict worsens, they may indeed turn to Tehran for the sort of military advice that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards are providing in Iraq -- and for funding and oil. Saudi and Iranian involvement in Yemen threatens to deepen sectarian distrust in a country where Sunni and Shia have historically not been enemies. This would suit both AQAP and ISIS (Islamic State in Syria and Iraq) which announced its sudden and murderous arrival in Yemen this month with massive suicide bombings at two Houthi mosques in Sanaa, killing at least 150 people. As the International Crisis Group puts it, a ""long history of coexistence is beginning to break down"" in Yemen. Baron says one critical question is whether ISIS and AQAP will now go head-to-head in trying to kill as many Houthis as possible. For the United States, which worked hard to ""stand up"" the Hadi government and encourage its campaign to eradicate AQAP, recent events have been a disaster. There will be less actionable intelligence against one of al Qaeda's most potent affiliates, and its Sunni allies in the Middle East (and especially the Gulf) will have even less interest than before in dialogue with Iran on issues from its nuclear program to Iraq. U.S. options have also diminished with the hurried withdrawal of some 100 military personnel from al-Anad airbase in the south of Yemen hours before it was seized by the Houthis. Drone operations from the base had at least blunted AQAP's freedom of action, even if they failed to eradicate the group. The unseen hand in Yemen's collapse is former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was badly injured in a bomb attack in 2011, and eventually (very eventually) persuaded to cede office to Hadi after 33 years in power. But he was allowed to remain in the country and has not given up his political ambitions. Last fall, he was sanctioned by both the United Nations and the U.S. for undermining efforts to forge a new political settlement in Yemen. Baron believes Saleh is biding his time -- waiting for an opportunity to inject his son, Ahmed Ali, into Yemen's complex political equation. Ahmed Ali was formerly commander of Yemen's Republican Guard, and parts of the armed forces are still regarded as loyal to the Saleh clan. For now, Saleh has a marriage of convenience with the Houthis, but few expect it to survive. When he was President, Saleh launched a series of brief wars against the Houthis between 2004 and 2010. ""Neither trusts the other; their recent cooperation notwithstanding, they are competing for political dominance, especially in the northern tribal highlands and the military,"" says the International Crisis Group. For the people of Yemen, the brief flash of hope that came with the Arab Spring is now a distant memory. Last week, at least nine protesters were killed in the central city of Taiz and more than 100 injured by Houthi militia. Aden has been rocked by looting and score-settling among rival clans. ""Human rights in Yemen are in free-fall as even peaceful protest becomes a life-threatening activity,"" according to Said Boumedouha of Amnesty International. For the past three years, different parties and factions have fought over the state's few assets while the standard of living of ordinary Yemenis has continued to plummet. A U.N.-led effort to agree on a new constitution has been mired in squabbling, with all parties failing to honor commitments. ""Even more damaging, those with most influence -- the Saudis and Iranians in particular -- are taking steps to undercut the negotiations,"" says the International Crisis Group. ""This combination of proxy wars, sectarian violence, state collapse and militia rule has become sadly familiar in the region. Nobody is likely to win such a fight,"" the ICG says. But for now, such a fight seems destined to continue.","Saudi Arabia-led coalition launched airstrikes in Yemen last Wednesday .

"(CNN)There were three Selma to Montgomery marches in March 1965, and Rosa Parks had missed the first one. Parks, whose act of civil disobedience sparked the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, moved to Detroit two years later for safety reasons. Death threats, in Alabama, were too much for her to endure. For eight years, Parks, a working-class woman, toiled at the Stockton Sewing Co. in Michigan, making dishrags, for low wages. But on March 1, 1965, she abruptly quit to join U.S. Rep. John Conyers' staff in Detroit. The voting rights movement in the South, led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., coupled with the assassination of Malcolm X that February, had re-energized her appetite for direct political action. On Sunday, March 7, Parks was at home in Detroit watching the ABC television premiere of ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" when the broadcast was suddenly interrupted by a news flash from Selma, Alabama. A peaceful throng of voting rights activists had marched onto the steel-arched Edmund Pettus Bridge that spanned the Alabama River, only to be brutally assaulted by police and Alabama state troopers, most of them wearing gas masks. Before being arrested and beaten these protesters had been headed to the state capital in Montgomery, a distance of 54 miles, to demand federal protection of blacks' right to vote. That Sunday afternoon, 25-year-old John Lewis, then chairman of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and today a U.S. congressman from Georgia's 5th District, had been tear-gassed and billy clubbed as he tried to cross the bridge. The sight of him being beaten sickened Parks. Lewis had emerged as the bravest and youngest of the major civil rights leaders of the Kennedy-Johnson era, even speaking at the March on Washington in 1963. As a Freedom Rider in the South, he was arrested 24 times, and proud of it. Therefore on March 9, to protest ""Bloody Sunday,"" as the incident became known, Parks walked down Detroit's wide Woodward Avenue in full solidarity with Brother Lewis and the others arrested in Selma. ""The Edmund Pettus Bridge for me was wrought in symbolism,"" Parks recalled years later. ""The photos taken that day made me think of the bridge as a battlefield, like at Lexington and Concord. It was the start of a turning point."" So when King -- who had been in Atlanta for ""Bloody Sunday"" -- telegrammed Parks about returning to Alabama to take part in a third mass march from Selma to Montgomery, her immediate answer was ""Why, of course."" Once back in Montgomery in late March at King's request, Parks looked around to see what had changed since the '50s. ""One of the first things I did was look at the buses,"" she told me in 1997. ""And yes -- they were integrated. ... That felt good."" On March 25, Parks, the ""Mother of the Movement,"" spoke eloquently in Montgomery though her soft voice was barely audible over the crackling speakers. Per usual, King stole the show that day with a rousing piece of oratory. ""We are on the move,"" the Nobel Peace Prize-winning preacher shouted, ""and no wave of racism will stop us!"" That evening King flew back to Atlanta in high spirits, deeming the third Selma-to-Montgomery march an unqualified success. Yet Parks, near broke, took a bus back to Atlanta the next day, deeply depressed.  There was too much white hatred still in Montgomery to feel victorious. Her great fear was that Selma was only a stride forward, in basketball parlance, not a slam-dunk. America was still poisoned by the curse of institutional racism. The fight for voting rights was just beginning. True ballot-box equality was still a long way off. Even after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that summer, Parks remained somewhat skeptical. She knew Southern white bigots would concoct evil new ways to disenfranchise black people. As America reflects on the significance of the 50th anniversary of Selma this weekend, it's important to honor the martyrs of ""Bloody Sunday"" in a lasting way. Certainly, the fact that Barack Obama, an African-American, is U.S. President proves that Lewis didn't get his head dented in vain. But the recent egregious findings of the Department of Justice following the Michael Brown case as well as other incidents resulting in the deaths of unarmed men of color still give us reason to pause. ""I remember feeling something was not right,"" Parks recalled shortly after the third Selma march. ""Even though the march was over, I felt that everything was not right."" One thing ""not right"" on the 50th anniversary of the Selma marches is the sad fact that the Edmund Pettus Bridge hasn't been renamed the John Lewis Bridge. Continuing to honor Pettus -- a Confederate general, U.S. senator and white supremacist -- is insulting to America's civil rights heroes. When the bridge was built in 1940, Jim Crow ruled Alabama. Dallas County blacks had no say in the bridge being named to honor a Reconstruction-era white supremacist. Thankfully a group of conscientious students has recently started a petition drive to rid the iconic bridge of Pettus' name. But let's go further than just removing Pettus' name; let's rename the bridge for someone who deserves our admiration. I'm not a historian who thinks Confederate memorials should be boarded up. Places such as Jefferson Davis' Beauvoir estate along the Mississippi Gulf Coast and the pedestaled statue of Robert E. Lee in New Orleans (turning his back to the North) need historic preservation. But the Edmund Pettus Bridge -- which in 2013 was declared a National Historic Landmark -- isn't symbolic of the Civil War in a meaningful way.  It is, however, the modern-day battlefield where the voting rights movement was born. There is no more fitting tribute to the death of Jim Crow than to rename the ""Bloody Sunday"" bridge after Lewis. I urge President Barack Obama, the National Park Service, the state of Alabama and the city of Selma to ""do the right thing."" Like the Statue of Liberty, the John Lewis Bridge would become a sacred place for visitors to reflect on noble American traditions -- in this case, peaceful protest and voting rights. The ""We Shall Overcome"" year of 1965 would, at last, be given its historical due in Selma. ""I'm with the kids,""  the Rev. Joseph Lowery, a close associate of King's, recently said in supporting the Edmund Pettus Bridge being redesignated. ""Let's change it.""","Ceremonies attended by President Obama to mark march's 50th anniversary over bridge .

"(CNN)As a manager at several prominent media outlets, Katharine Zaleski did not understand the demands on working moms and often belittled their work ethic. Then she became a mom, and everything changed. In a widely shared piece this week for Fortune.com, the journalist-turned-startup executive apologizes for disparaging the mothers she worked with in her 20s at the Huffington Post and Washington Post. Zaleski said she committed multiple ""infractions,"" against these women, including scheduling late-afternoon meetings or happy hours without considering that mothers with after-work responsibilities wouldn't be able to attend. She even didn't disagree ""when another female editor said we should hurry up and fire another woman before she 'got pregnant.' "" Now a mother to a young daughter, Zaleski said she was wrong to undervalue mothers' contributions by counting hours logged in the office and not the actual work done. ""I wish I had known five years ago, as a young, childless manager, that mothers are the people you need on your team,"" she wrote. ""There's a saying that 'if you want something done then ask a busy person to do it.' That's exactly why I like working with mothers now."" Zaleski's piece has been shared more than 1,000 times and has been hailed on social media by many commenters who applaud her for seeing the error of her ways. ""Your message is so important and it's about time it was addressed,"" said Heather Bouvier on Twitter. ""THANK YOU for writing this. There are so many people like your then-childless 28-year-old self who need to read it. Seriously, thank you from the bottom of my heart,"" wrote Alice Gomstyn on Facebook. Since the essay was published Tuesday, Zaleski told CNN she's received more than 2,000 emails from readers who admit they've committed similar infractions in the workplace. ""I'm so motivated and thrilled,"" she said.  ""I couldn't be more psyched for the responses."" But not all the responses have been positive. Some people refuse to accept Zaleski's apology and accuse her of borrowing from similar apologetic essays by other new moms. ""This woman has basically stolen another woman's post about her views on mothers with children in the workforce for her own personal gain!!,"" wrote one commenter on Zaleski's essay. Others accuse Zaleski of writing the essay just to promote the new company she co-founded, Power to Fly, an online platform that matches women with technical skills to freelance projects they can do from anywhere. ""This woman & her shameless self-promoting article disgust me. No awareness. No integrity,"" Kitten Holiday said on Twitter. Zaleski said that notion is ""just silly,"" and she's taken a huge risk leaving a stable job to start a company that is a part of the solution. Zaleski said her company, which launched in August, enables women to work from home so that they can ""be valued for their productivity and not time spent sitting in an office or at a bar bonding afterwards."" But some critics say encouraging mothers to work from home only perpetuates a problem. ""I like this article a lot, but wish the solution wasn't to have a company that helps mothers find jobs that keep them tucked away at home, but to change the dominant culture to create better, more supportive workplaces where flexible schedules are encouraged,"" said Suzanne Pekow Carlson on Facebook. Others say they wish Zaleski went further, and instead of only addressing the challenges of the working mother, wished she'd included other caregivers, like dads. ""I hope the convo ... expands beyond just working moms to working dads, folks taking care of sick parents, etc.,"" ABC's Karen Travers said on Twitter. ""I don't understand why we still refuse to acknowledge that our society needs to be more flexible for PARENTS. It is not just the woman's burden,"" said Margaret Weingart Berger on Facebook. And said another commenter on Zaleski's essay, ""If it takes this woman becoming a mother to understand the value of working mothers and have compassion for them, then I guess we can't expect men to understand and have compassion because they will never be able to be mothers themselves."" Zaleski said she finds the criticism ""frustrating,"" but said she refuses to dwell on the negative.  She wants to ""stay focused on helping women find fulfilling work they can do from home."" She said her essay represents her ""own personal experience,"" which happens to mostly involve working with mothers. But she's glad her piece has opened a dialogue and she hopes the conversation continues. Women not supporting women ""is a systemic problem in our society,"" Zaleski said. Serena Markstrom Nugent, posting on Facebook, agreed. ""To the women mad at her (Zaleski) and saying too little too late: She not only had not had kids but was very young and ambitious. In the spirit of not tearing down other women, I would say cheer her on for where she is on in the journey,"" she wrote. ""Still young, still learning, and at least at this point, it appears, part of the solution."" Still other critics suggest the issue isn't as simple as parents versus non-parents in the workplace. Instead, they say, it's about the lack of empathy that exists between colleagues whose circumstances are different from their own. ""Why is it necessary to 'walk in someone's shoes' before we understand their perspective?"" said Ann OConnell on Facebook. ""Until we strive to have understanding and compassion for people regardless of our personal circumstances or life choices, we will remain selfish and self-centered as a whole.""","Katharine Zaleski said she judged working moms before she became one .

"(CNN)A suicide bomb attack in Iraq this week was carried out by an American jihadist, ISIS claims. The terrorist group released a photograph on Tuesday of a masked fighter it identified as Abu Daood Al-Amriki, an alleged American jihadist who committed the suicide attack. The claim grabbed headlines, but days later, neither CNN nor U.S. government officials have been able to confirm the identity of the attacker. ISIS claims the attacker used an explosives-laden vehicle to mount an attack in Samarra, Iraq. Two senior Iraqi security officials confirmed that an attack matching the description did take place -- that a suicide attacker rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into a convoy of Iraqi forces. At least three Iraqi security forces were killed in the attack, the sources said. But ISIS has not released the birth name of the alleged American suicide bomber, or shown his face. U.S. officials tell CNN that for the moment there is nothing to corroborate the claim.","ISIS claims a suicide attack in Iraq was carried out by an American .

"(CNN)A Spanish dolphin trainer who was accused on social media of abusing the animals has been found dead, a source with the Spanish National Police told CNN on Saturday. Jose Luis Barbero was expected to become vice president of the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, CNN affiliate WSB reported. He was found dead inside his vehicle in the public parking lot of the Palma de Mallorca airport on the island of Mallorca, the source said. The source said the case is being treated as a suicide. Georgia Aquarium Chairman and CEO Mike Leven issued a strongly worded statement that said: . ""Georgia Aquarium began a search for truth in hopes of disproving these unsubstantiated claims. Sadly, (Barbero)  and his family received death threats, and groups and individuals rushed to judge him.  He was not given the right or the privilege to be considered innocent until proven guilty ... His death is untimely, unnecessary and unjust."" Barbero, 59, went missing recently and authorities had started searching for him. In February, videos circulated of animal trainers in Spain allegedly hitting and kicking dolphins. Posters on social media claimed Barbero was one of them. The Georgia Aquarium questioned the authenticity of the videos but put his employment on hold. The video footage is grainy and dark, and faces are difficult to make out. Trainers are making fast foot and hand motions in the dolphins' direction, but it is unclear if these are blows. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the videos. Barbero's employer in Spain, Marineland Mallorca, denied the allegations and said it planned to take legal action against Barbero's accusers, according to the Georgia Aquarium.","Dolphin trainer Jose Luis Barbero was found dead in his vehicle, Spanish police say .

"(CNN)The suspect behind the knife attack on the American ambassador to South Korea had a long, troubled history and often blamed the U.S. for tensions in the Korean Peninsula. Kim Ki-Jong, 55, was quickly overpowered and taken into custody after he attacked U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert with a fruit knife Thursday morning. Police say Kim's motive for the attack was to improve North-South Korean relations and to stop the annual military exercises held jointly by the U.S. and South Korea. It wasn't the first time Kim has taken drastic steps to make his point. -- In 2010, Kim was given a suspended jail sentence for hurling a concrete block at a Japanese envoy to South Korea, according to the Yonhap news agency. That incident is believed to be the first attack on a foreign ambassador in South Korea. -- Kim allegedly harbored sympathies for North Korea, according to Korean media reports. Yonhap reported that Kim had visited North Korea six times between 2006 and 2007, had attempted to erect a memorial for former North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il in Seoul, and once set himself on fire in front of the presidential office. -- He was frequently seen at protests, wearing a beret and blaming U.S. policies for straining relations between North and South Korea. Kim was a member of the Korea Council For Reconciliation and Cooperation, which hosted Lippert at the Thursday event where the attack occurred. The group advocates reunification of the Koreas as well as humanitarian aid to North Korea. Kim was one of its 181 members, but wasn't on the list of those invited for the event, according to police. But he was allowed in because an event staff recognized him from the organization. A witness who was sitting next to Lippert during the attack said Kim was known for having ""unpredictable behavior"" in the organization. Even though he appeared somewhat disheveled Thursday morning, he was able to enter the event because the staff was familiar with Kim, police said. Immediately after he allegedly slashed the ambassador in the face and arm, Kim was tackled to the floor. As he was transferred to a hospital Kim shouted, ""The South Korea-U.S. military drills must stop."" Every year, the United States and South Korea hold joint military drills, which both countries say are defensive and non-provocative in nature. But the exercises also draw criticism from the North Korean regime, which characterize the drills as rehearsals for an attack on the regime. Kim also told South Korean reporters that he had planned the attack for 10 days, and claimed responsibility for burning a U.S. flag at the embassy in the 1980s. A website associated with Kim, displayed a photo of him with protesters holding a sign that read: ""Stop war exercises that block North-South Korean dialogue."" The picture was taken at February 24, in front of the U.S. embassy, according to his website. It also contains a picture of an American soldier inside a red crossed-out circle. On Thursday, Kim shouted at reporters, saying that the U.S. was to blame for blocking family reunions of North and South Koreans who have been separated since the Korean War. On the website, he lamented that ""the whole atmosphere of the Korean peninsula is freezing up like a frozen soil."" CNN's KJ Kwon and Paula Hancocks in Seoul contributed to this report, as did CNN's Judy Kwon and Sol Han from Hong Kong.","Suspect Kim Ki-jung was captured after U.S. ambassador was slashed in Seoul .

"(CNN)If you were the member of a minority group and tried to create a system to control and oppress the majority, you could not have done a better job than the white leaders of Ferguson, Missouri. Let's start with the demographics. Ferguson is small -- roughly 20,000 residents -- and is 67% black and 29% white. Over the past decade, Ferguson's population has changed from majority white to majority black. Its elected officials did not. Five of six City Council members are white, as is the city's mayor. How does this happen in a city two-thirds black? Two answers: timing of elections and type of elections. Ferguson, like most municipalities, holds elections in April of odd-numbered years. However research shows that such ""off-cycle"" elections reduces voter turnout. Ferguson also holds nonpartisan elections, which means that there are no party labels on the ballot. This not only reduces the likelihood that people will vote, it also has been shown to reduce what voters know about the candidates. Although Missouri does not track the race of its voters, according to an article in The Washington Post, Catalist, a private voter data firm, performed a study and found that the voting rules operating in Ferguson effectively suppress the black vote. In the national election in November 2012, the study found, voter turnout between blacks (54%) and whites (55%) was virtually identical. But because of the vast racial differences in the city's population, it resulted in an electorate that was 71% black and 28% white. Fast-forward five months later in April, when whites were three times (17%) more likely to vote than blacks (6%). That resulted in an electorate that was majority white: 52% versus 47%. That is how a majority-black population winds up with almost all-white elected representatives. Ferguson's law enforcement officers are also not representative, with roughly 94% of its police force being white. Similarly Ferguson's local judges are nonrepresentative. I'm sensing a pattern here. Local judges are appointed by the Ferguson City Council upon nomination by the mayor for a two-year term. The Ferguson Municipal Court is also all-white. But the black citizens of Ferguson apparently keep the police and local judges very busy. In 2013, Ferguson had the highest number of warrants issued in the state, when you control for size: 3.6 pending arrest warrants per household and 2.2 arrest warrants on average per person. And 95% of people arrested for jaywalking in Ferguson are black. While 67% of the population is black, 86% of vehicle stops involve a black driver. While 29% of the population is white, 12.9% of vehicle stops involve a white driver. Blacks were almost twice as likely to be searched as whites, even though searches of blacks were less likely than whites to result in contraband being found (21% vs. 34%). Nobody said racism made sense. But for Ferguson, it has made money. In prior years Ferguson tried to raise sales tax but learned the hard way that it did not result in increased revenue because people voted with their feet and took their wealth with them. Ferguson turned to a different revenue source: collecting traffic fines and penalties from the largely black population. Those revenues constitute Ferguson's second-highest revenue source. Once a resident gets a ticket and does not appear in court with an explanation, an arrest warrant is likely issued. Once arrested, the resident may sit in jail for a very long time, while the fees and fines continue to accrue. A class-action lawsuit filed this month against the city of Ferguson has challenged this funding system, calling it a ""modern debtors' prison scheme."" The remarkable part of this story is how patient the black residents of Ferguson have been. It took the death of a teenager to get them mad enough to protest and the nation got mad with them. Between the class-action lawsuit and the Department of Justice's involvement, blacks in Ferguson should know the world is watching. The arc of history is long and bends towards justice -- and help is finally on the way.","Dorothy Brown: Ferguson political system has been effective at oppressing majority .

"Concord, New Hampshire (CNN)Scott Walker brought his Midwestern swagger to New Hampshire on Saturday, leading a crowd of activists to cheers as he sought to draw a contrast to his top-tier rival in the unofficial GOP presidential race, Jeb Bush. The Wisconsin governor, amid charges from critics that he's a flip-flopper, also acknowledged that he had changed positions on immigration reform but argued that he's remained consistent in everything else. Walker was met with great fanfare at his only open event during his two-day stop to the first-in-the-nation primary state. Activists gathered at Concord High School for a training event that was hosted by the New Hampshire GOP and headlined by Walker's appearance. Jeb Bush makes 2016 debut in New Hampshire . The contrasts made against Bush were subtle, but Walker emphasized his modest roots as the son of a preacher and reiterated his penchant for shopping at Kohl's while armed with coupons. ""I actually stopped by Kohl's and bought this sweater in the rack where it's 70% off,"" he said, pointing to the sweater he was wearing. ""And we paid one dollar for it with our Kohl's Cash  ... so, living the high life,"" he added. Walker has used his humble beginnings and department-store bona fides in Iowa as well, a strategy aimed to cement the fact that he didn't grow up with ""fame and fortune,"" as he frequently says. On Saturday, he also put on a cap handed to him by an audience member with the logo for Gun Owners of New Hampshire. ""You've got a first-rate record on the Second Amendment; we hope you'll wear the hat often and keep up the good work,"" the man said. Walker wore it for the rest of his time on stage. (While he may have donned the cap-and-sweater look Saturday afternoon, he was set to sport a tux later that night for his speaking appearance at the Gridiron Club's annual white-tie dinner in Washington, D.C. President Barack Obama was also scheduled to speak at the dinner.) Answering a question from another audience member, Walker laid down his staunch opposition to Common Core, a set of testing standards that Bush defended as usual during his visit to New Hampshire on Friday. Walker also stood against re-authorizing the No Child Left Behind Act, another topic on which the two Republicans disagree. Those comments came after Walker argued, in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times on Friday, that Bush would represent a step towards the past, rather than the future. ""We had Bob Dole, John McCain, Mitt Romney. If it's just whoever's next up, that hasn't worked so well for the Republican Party in the past,"" he said. ""Jeb's a good man. You're not going to hear me speak ill will of Jeb...I just think voters are going to look at this and say, 'If we're running against Hillary Clinton, we'll need a name from the future -- not a name from the past --  to win.' "" In his remarks Saturday, Walker also hit the President over foreign policy and took a shot at Hillary Clinton for giving ""Russia a reset button."" On domestic policy, he laid out his small-government vision for a system in which success is measured by ""how many people are no longer dependent on the government."" Asked by reporters Saturday to respond to flip-flopping accusations by his critics, Walker said the ""the only major issue out there was immigration."" Indeed Walker reversed his stance earlier this month when he acknowledged that he's no longer in favor of legislation that would let undocumented immigrants remain in the United States. He said Saturday that his change in tune reflected the will of the public. ""This is one where we listened to the people all across the country, particularly border governors who saw how this President messed that up, and that's an issue where I think people want leaders who are willing to listen to the people on that,"" he said. Any other accusations of flip-flopping, he added, ""are just ridiculous."" Critics have argued that Walker has been taking a tougher line against abortion in an effort to woo conservatives during the primaries. The governor recently expressed support for a ban on abortion after 20 weeks, after first declining to state his position during his re-election bid in the fall. And critics point to an ad by his campaign in which Walker said he supports legislation that leaves ""the final decision to a woman and her doctor."" Walker said Saturday he's remained steady in his views on abortion. ""I'm pro-life. My position is consistent on that,"" he said. ""They're taking an ad out there that talked about what the law did in the state (that) was endorsed by Wisconsin Right to Life, so it's a pro-life law."" He also defended his support for the federal ethanol mandate that helps Iowa farmers, despite opposing it in Wisconsin in the past. Walker's more private itinerary included meetings with New Hampshire business and political leaders, including Massachusetts' former senator, Scott Brown, who resides in New Hampshire and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate seat in the state last year.","The Wisconsin governor is on a two-day stop in the first-in-the-nation primary state .

"(CNN)Researchers say Dr. Ben Carson may be a brain surgeon, but science shows he's dead wrong about how sexual orientation works. Wednesday on CNN, Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and potential Republican presidential candidate, said he ""absolutely"" believes being gay is a choice. But scientists say decades of research overwhelmingly shows sexual preference is inborn, not a choice. ""It doesn't seem to be the social environment, it doesn't seem to be the parents or peers that make you gay,"" said Gerulf Rieger, a lecturer in the department of psychology at the University of Essex in England. ""It seems to be something that comes from within."" ""Sexual orientation is biologically determined,"" added Cynthia Struckman-Johnson, a professor of psychology at the University of South Dakota. ""I don't think any educated person aware of the research would argue differently."" In a statement Wednesday, Carson apologized for what he said on CNN, and softened his words, saying the verdict is still out on whether people are born with their sexual preference. ""I do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation,"" he added. While science is seldom definitive about anything, especially something as complicated as why we love who we love, researchers say the preponderance of the evidence shows sexual orientation is not chosen. They point to studies showing children are aware of their sexual orientation at a young age. Plus, genetic studies suggest homosexuality runs in families. Finally, researchers have found that the very structure of the brain -- specifically, regions of the hypothalamus -- differs in gay and heterosexual men. ""Ask a bunch of straight guys [if they could switch to being gay] and they would tell you, 'Are you kidding me?"" Rieger said. ""So the other way around doesn't work either."" So what was Carson's scientific support for his argument that being gay is a choice? He pointed to prisons. ""A lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight - and when they come out, they're gay. So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question,"" Carson told CNN's Chris Cuomo. Experts on sexual activity in prisons challenged the very premise of Carson's statement, calling it ""preposterous"" and ""appalling."" ""To, in any way, suggest that a person would go in as a heterosexual and then somehow become a homosexual as a result, that's simply preposterous. There's no evidence to support that,"" said Robert Dumond, a mental health counselor who's testified to the Department of Justice about rape in prison. Prisoners do engage in homosexual practices, but that doesn't mean they've gone from straight to gay, the experts said. Prisoners are often raped, they say, or coerced to engage in sex in exchange for protection from violent prisoners. ""They're physically forced or forced through blackmail to engage in sex,"" Struckman-Johnson said. ""To have someone say this is chosen is just showing such great disregard for what we know about the world of sexual assault in prison."" Opinion: Prison doesn't make people 'come out' gay . The prisoners who are perpetrating the rape are often either gay to begin with, or are heterosexual and rape to subjugate other prisoners. ""It's more about power than sex,"" said Chris Hensley, a criminologist at the University of Tennessee who's done extensive research on sexuality in prison. ""These men don't see what they're doing as homosexual, and they will leave their incarceration heterosexual."" Other prisoners do willingly engage in homosexual activity, but the experts say it's more of a way to release sexual tension and have some degree of intimacy. ""It doesn't mean they would choose someone of the same gender in any other situation,"" Struckman-Johnson said. Critics of these studies point out other research they say indicates that orientation is a choice, namely studies that show sexual orientation can change over the course of a lifetime, and that ""socialization"" can alter orientation. Overall, the scientists with whom we spoke said they were shocked at Carson's arguments. ""I'm deeply saddened on multiple levels that someone in the 21st century would take this position,"" Dumond said. Jen Christensen contributed to this report.","Scientists say decades of research overwhelmingly shows sexual preference is inborn, not a choice .

"(CNN)For years, they've wanted six seasons and a movie, and at 3:01 a.m. ET Tuesday, fans got it ... almost. There's no movie yet, but ""Community's"" much-awaited sixth season made its debut. Not even cancellation by NBC could kill the fan favorite sitcom, as Yahoo streamed the first two episodes of the new season early Tuesday. The show appears to have suffered no decline in quality in the move to Yahoo, though cast member Yvette Nicole Brown (now on CBS' ""The Odd Couple"") had to leave the show for family reasons. The premiere briefly touches on this in its own way, with Shirley's absence sounding a lot like the setup for a spinoff (as the character Abed points out, along with several other inconsistencies throughout the episode). The ""new Shirley,"" as Dean joked, is Paget Brewster's Frankie, who exists to play the disapproving authority figure to antagonize the former study group. Soon, the group was running a Prohibition-esque bar before they could learn to live with Frankie. And how about the end of the first episode, which gave us a look at the spinoff, ""The Butcher and the Baker,"" with Shirley and Steven Weber as a Southern lawyer? Episode two got even more out there, with Dean Pelton's adventures in 1990s-style virtual reality and a less-successful plotline involving Britta's parents. Most interesting was the introduction of Keith David as '90s tech genius Elroy. Critics praised the show, with The Hollywood Reporter's Amy Amatangelo saying, ""Everything fans loved about Community remains -- the first two episodes are chock-full of increasingly bizarre pop-culture references (Portuguese Gremlins, anyone?) and meta commentary. The show has seamlessly transferred to an online venue."" Time's James Poniewozik also liked it (despite some reservations about the plot), writing, ""The first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods, and it does."" Soon after the show went online, devoted fans on Twitter had their say.","The fan favorite comedy ""Community"" returns for a sixth season on Yahoo .

"(CNN)They were not-so-affectionately dubbed the ""bed-wetters"" by then-Obama senior adviser David Plouffe. The definition: Democrats who run to the hills every time there's a bump in the road. The Chicken Littles. The woe-is-us crowd. Well, they're at it again. Not surprisingly, it's because of the Hillary Clinton email brouhaha, an unforced error that is now ricocheting around the political world. And the home team stands in place, just watching, somewhat stunned. But Democrats don't actually have the luxury of standing by and seeing how this all plays out. Hillary Clinton is their candidate; their putative nominee. ""Their only viable plan is to make her the best candidate possible,"" says one senior Democratic strategist. ""And from time to time, this may require an intervention."" Now might be a good time. But while the anxious Democrats shake their heads about the state of affairs — and the lack of serious alternatives in the presidential lineup — they might do well to look at themselves. Over the past six years, there's been a sharp structural decline of elected Democrats everywhere below the presidential level. Sure, we all know about how the Republicans regained control of the Senate in 2014, but what about the fact that blue-state governors fell like tent poles? Or that GOP governors now outnumber the Democrats by almost two-to-one, 31 to 18. Or that Republicans have complete control of nearly three times as many state legislatures as the Democrats, 30 to 11. And down the ballot, Democrats under Obama have lost more than 900 state legislative seats: the worst showing of any modern president. That's eye-popping. So, the conventional judgment that the Clinton behemoth is just too big — too well funded, too well supported, too historic — all helps account for the paucity of alternatives, to be sure. But there's much, much more to it than the phenom of Bigfoot Hillary. It's the phenom of Barack Obama, too — and the very strong counterforces he's generated around the country. The gains at the presidential level have not been cost-free: The country is polarized, the Democrats are often on defense and they're losing ground. One result: a thin presidential bench, which is painfully evident. Clinton asks State to release emails: What you need to know . And if you take a peek at those blue-state governors who might be president, consider this: At 76, Jerry Brown, an able leader, is probably past his sell-by date for a presidential bid. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has made very few moves to raise his national profile. And Democratic governors are very thin on the ground in the heartland. Any time you have Republicans winning the gubernatorial races in Massachusetts, Illinois and Maryland, Democrats should pay attention. As has been the case with other presidents, for Obama party-building has not been on top of the agenda. But it shows. And so when Hillary Clinton runs into some trouble, the Democrats ought to worry. The Republicans have a deep and varied field; the Democrats have one real horse in the race no matter how much she stumbles out of the gate. Speaking of Hillary Clinton, part of the problem right now is situational. Those Democrats who want to defend her say there's a problem -- they're not quite sure what they're defending, because they're not sure exactly what happened, or why. In other words, the wagons are circled, but the surrogates are left outside. Next, while Team Clinton may have considered the upside of waiting to announce her candidacy (Why not let the GOP battle it out? No need to give the GOP early target practice?), the downside is now obvious: How do you mount a defense with no real or organized apparatus to respond? If you're out there making personal appearances, it looks odd to ignore the elephant in the room. No matter how much you tweet about it. Clinton's stumbles fuel Democratic critics . Bottom line, there is no organized pushback and there is no Plan B. (OK, Jim Webb, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders, we know who you are, and that you're probably running, but still.) Or at least no Big Plan B. The pre-presidential league on the Democratic side is not exactly overflowing with big-time candidates. (Unless you think Vice President Joe Biden is running or Secretary of State John Kerry is running, which they likely are not. Same for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.) So ""bed-wetters,"" beware. The truth is simple: Your job is to defend Hillary Clinton, not to bury her. Yes, it can be hard. Even annoying. But think about it this way: If you don't, her problems become your own.","Gloria Borger: Democratic Party has no real alternative for 2016 and its bench is painfully thin .
She says it may not be fun, but Democrats have no choice but to defend Clinton on issues like the email question ."

"Boston (CNN)Bill Richard knew his son wasn't going to make it. But the father of three told his wife he couldn't stay by 8-year-old Martin's side. The boy's body was torn apart by an explosion near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. His skin had changed color. A crowd hovered over him, frantically trying to help, but he was dying. Speaking from the witness stand at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial on Thursday, Richard told jurors he was faced with a heartbreaking choice. ""I knew in my head that I needed to act quickly, or we might not only lose Martin,"" he said. ""We might lose Jane, too."" Moments after the blast, Richard had stumbled toward Jane, his 7-year-old daughter. His pants and sneakers were torn apart. His legs felt like they were on fire. He could barely hear. And the air smelled ""vile,"" he said, like gunpowder, sulfur and burned hair. But he soon realized the situation was much worse for his daughter. ""She tried to get up and she fell. That was when I noticed her leg,"" he said. ""She didn't have it. It was blown off."" So Richard left one son to die near the marathon finish line, and shielded his other son's eyes from the carnage as they raced to the hospital, hoping that doctors could save his daughter's life. ""It was,"" Richard said Thursday, ""the last time I saw my son alive -- barely."" Richard's description of the explosion's horrifying aftermath capped a day of dramatic testimony as survivors shared their stories in the second day of the high-profile trial. Tsarnaev's attorneys admit that he carried out the 2013 attacks, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others at the marathon. A fourth person, an MIT police officer, was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, allegedly ran from police. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed after a gunbattle with police. And now, his younger brother sits in court facing 30 federal charges related to the bombings. His attorneys say he was influenced by his slain brother to participate in the attacks. They argued Thursday that now isn't the right time for jurors to hear the string of harrowing stories from survivors of the explosions, arguing that testimony should be part of a later phase of the trial, when jurors will decide what penalty Tsarnaev should face. But the judge sided with prosecutors, who argued the testimony was necessary to support their indictment. On Thursday, jurors relived the moments after the marathon bombings through the eyes of some of the people most affected by the blasts. Defense attorneys didn't ask them any questions. Jeff Bauman was suspicious as soon as he noticed a black backpack on the ground near the finish line. ""I thought it was weird,"" he said Thursday. ""If you are at the airport, if you see any unattended luggage, you notify authorities."" But this was Boston, he thought, where stuff like that doesn't happen. Still, he told a friend they should move. An explosion came two seconds later. ""I saw a flash, heard like three pops and I was on the ground,"" Bauman said from the witness stand Thursday. ""At first I opened my eyes and saw the sky. The first thought was, that was a big firework."" Bauman's ears were ringing, and everything was muffled, but he heard the screams. The first bomb had exploded. ""I looked down and saw my legs, and it was pure carnage,"" he told jurors. ""I could see my bone."" Bauman testified about becoming aware of his injuries -- burns, wounds on his back, and his legs. ""I knew my legs were gone. I know that instantly,"" he said. He kept repeating to himself, ""This is messed up, this is messed up, this is messed up."" Then the second explosion. ""We are under attack,"" he thought to himself. All he wanted to do was call his mom. When Boston Police Officer Lauren Woods saw people running by, screaming, she ran against the grain, toward Boylston Street, the last leg on the marathon route. One of the first victims Woods came across was Lu Lingzi, a graduate student at Boston University. Lu was vomiting profusely, Woods recalled Thursday. Others were already performing CPR on her, and the officer attempted to clear Lu's airway. ""I smelled the residue of smoke,"" Woods said. ""Smelled like fireworks, cannons."" Paramedics arrived, and eventually told Woods the young woman was not going to make it and they had to move on to other people. Lu became one of the three fatalities at the scene. It smelled like gunpowder, Alan Hern told the jury, and ""kind of felt like we were underwater."" Hern's wife -- who was pregnant -- was running the race. He found her uninjured, but hysterical from the explosions and ensuing chaos, he said. There were powder marks on her jacket. Hern, a high school football coach, then went searching for his 11-year-old son, Aaron. A figure covered in black soot and hair standing straight up caught Hern's eye, and he knew it was Aaron, he testified. His son's left thigh was cratered, mangled flesh and blood, Hern said. ""It was like something you'd see in a war movie,"" he said. ""His eyebrows were singed and his hair was sticking straight up."" Another of Thursday's witnesses, Roseann Sdoia, also referred to it as something out of a movie. Before she hit the ground from the blast, she said, it registered in her mind that she had lost her leg. ""When I looked down, my leg was tucked under me, but blood was pouring out,"" she told jurors. In front of her lay a socked foot. She started thinking -- Did I wear socks today? She decided she hadn't worn socks that day. It was someone else's foot. ""It was almost like I was starring in a horror movie,"" she said, ""as was everybody else around me."" Doctors had to amputate her leg below the knee. Traveling from the marathon finish line to the hospital, Bill Richard went from one terrifying scene to another. ""You know it's not going to be good when you see the look of horror on doctors' faces,"" he told the court Thursday. ""Jane was devastatingly injured."" Doctors amputated her left leg below the knee and removed more than 20 shrapnel pieces from her body, he said. Richard soon learned that, as he'd feared, Martin didn't survive the bombing. His wife, Denise, was also hospitalized after the attack. She lost sight in one eye. The father said his own injuries were much less severe than the wounds many other victims suffered. The ringing in his ears never stops, and he lost some of his hearing. But Richard said he could still hear the lawyer questioning him at Thursday's trial. He can still hear music. And the most important thing. ""I can still hear,"" he said, ""the beautiful voices of my family.""​ . CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. Mariano Castillo and Catherine E.

"(CNN)Angelina Jolie's decision to remove her breasts and ovaries to prevent cancer (as she detailed in today's New York Times op-ed) might sound extreme, but breast cancer experts say she was spot on. ""I understand what Angelina Jolie did, and I would have done it, too,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Brawley said if he were Jolie's doctor he would have advised her to do what she did because her mother, aunt, and grandmother all had ovarian cancer, and her mother had breast cancer as well. Plus, Jolie has a gene that gives her about an 87% chance of getting breast cancer sometime in her life. ""She has one of the particularly bad breast cancer genes,"" Brawley said. The decision is made even easier by advances in breast reconstruction and by hormone treatments that help ease women into menopause, which is induced by removing the ovaries. The ovary surgery was a no-brainer, doctors say, and some wondered why she didn't do it sooner. In her op-ed, Jolie explained that every year she's had a blood test called CA-125, to monitor for ovarian cancer. But that test often has false positives and false negatives, said Dr. Dr. Funmi Olopade, director of the Center for Clinical Cancer Genetics at the University of Chicago. ""You really can't rely on it,"" she said. Instead of screening, experts in cancer genetics recommend that women at a very high risk for ovarian cancer, like Jolie, remove their ovaries as soon as they're done having children. ""I can't emphasize enough how important this is,"" Olopade said. Olopade was glad to hear Tuesday morning that Jolie had decided to move forward. ""What she's done is really important to save her life, because there's no way to detect ovarian cancer,"" she said. Jolie's decision about her breasts (also documented in an op-ed), however, is not so clear cut, Olopade explained, because it would have been perfectly acceptable if Jolie had decided to keep her breasts and to get regular MRIs instead. ""We have lots of survivors who went that route, and they've done well,"" she said. Some made the decision to keep their breasts because they couldn't afford a good plastic surgeon for breast reconstruction, she added. ""Celebrities have access to that kind of surgery, but that's not the life everyone lives,"" Olopade said. Brawley added that Jolie's decision likely wouldn't be right for someone with a different kind of breast cancer gene mutation. For example, some women have a mutation that gives them a 15% chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime. That's not much higher than the 12% chance a woman has of getting breast cancer even if she has no mutation at all. He says he worries that some of these women with just a slightly increased risk will hear about Jolie's decision and want to remove their breasts, too. ""To get surgery in their situation is really overkill,"" he said. ""Most of these women would be just fine if they took tamoxifen for five years and got regular mammograms."" But all in all, doctors say they're glad Jolie has been so public with her decision making. ""These very publicly shared medical sagas from respected figures play a very powerful role in creating these teachable moments,"" said Dr. Ken Offit, chief of clinical genetics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. CNN's John Bonifield also contributed.","Jolie has a gene that gives her an 87% chance of getting breast cancer .

"(CNN)If death is the big sleep, as it is sometimes called, is there anything wrong with a dying person choosing a medically induced smaller sleep -- deep sedation -- to avoid the pain of a terminal illness? Is it OK for a patient to choose to spend his or her final days on this mortal coil in what would amount to a medically induced coma? Or is it simply euthanasia in disguise? Members of the French Parliament offered resounding support Tuesday for the proposition that is should be permissible for doctors to induce sleep until death in terminally ill patients who are in pain. They approved a bill allowing that by a vote of 436-34. There were, however, 83 lawmakers who declined to vote -- a measure of just how contentious the issue has been. The bill goes now to the French Senate. Should it become law, doctors would be allowed to administer ""deep sedation until death"" to terminally ill patients who request it, and for whom palliative care would not ease the pain. The law would also allow doctors who have stopped life-saving measures to administer deep sedation, if they deem it appropriate, to terminally ill patients who are unable to give their consent. ""Everyone has the right to a death that is dignified and soothed,"" the proposed law says. And health professionals, it continues, should ""implement all the means at their disposal to fulfill this right."" What the law entails, according to Jean Leonetti, the member of Parliament who proposed it, is simple: ""Sleep before death to avoid suffering."" What it also entails is legal protection for doctors who, in fact, already sedate some dying patients, and who are sometimes taken to court by relatives as a result. Euthanasia is illegal in France, though President Francois Hollande promised in his 2012 campaign that he would reopen the issue. Polls show that more than 90% of French people support the proposal -- an astonishing majority for any proposal -- and Hollande has said it  would represent a big step forward. But, as might be predicted, the proposed law has proved divisive in the extreme. Some lawmakers on the left of the political spectrum said in advance they would abstain from Tuesday's vote because they thought the bill did not go far enough toward legalizing euthanasia. And some on the right said they, too, would abstain, because they saw the law is a way of legalizing euthanasia in disguise. CNN's Jim Bittermann in Paris contributed to this report .","French Parliament approves Tuesday a bill that would allow doctors to put patients under deep sedation until they die .

"(CNN)Seeing a rainbow often fills people with a sense of joy, regardless of whether it is their first or 19th time witnessing the colorful creation. Rainbow Gatherings -- annual events that take place throughout the world -- encompass a vibrant mixture of the environment and people to produce a similar feeling of excitement. Photographer Matjaz Krivic's ""Somewhere Under the Rainbow"" series was shot over 19 years at Rainbow Gatherings in various countries. According to Krivic, the meaning behind the name of the events originates from an ancient Hopi Native American prophecy about ""Rainbow Warriors."" Rainbow Gatherings involve a temporary community of people who meet to share their similar ideals -- peace, harmony, freedom and respect. Those participating in the gatherings collectively refer to themselves as a ""Rainbow Family."" The community, which welcomes a wide spectrum of ages, comes together to embrace nature and establish an alternative space away from society's popular culture of consumerism, materialism and mass media. Those who attend are not required to pay any form of money, not even for food, and the gatherings do not have rigid structures of dominance nor one specific leader. Instead, Rainbow Gatherings are essentially idealistic movements driven by the convergence of its community's beliefs in a more equitable society and its people's love and tolerance for one another. ""The magic hat goes around and you put money if you have or if you want,"" Krivic said. ""(But) nobody needs to pay for the food. Everybody is welcome to go and eat there."" Krivic says that Rainbow Gatherings also tend to take place in regions of the world that ""need to be healed"" after having experienced devastating conflicts. Past gatherings include those held in Serbia, Bosnia and Ukraine. ""I really don't like what's going on in this world. ... There's just so much stuff happening,"" Krivic said. ""You can always go to (Rainbow Gatherings) and stay there and have a nice time, and you don't even have to pay for it. It will be a nice time, nice energy, not aggressive."" One of the most enjoyable aspects about Rainbow Gatherings is the many workshops and activities that are available, where people engage in and learn about everything from yoga and tai chi to meditation and healing techniques. Another significant part of Rainbow Gatherings is the all-encompassing sound. ""I like the music, I'm an audiophile. I like all sorts of music, but when I go there it's live, it's there,"" Krivic said. ""It's like two guys playing and eventually it's like 50 people playing and the music is just so beautiful."" The first Rainbow Gathering took place in Colorado in 1972, and it is believed to have been organized by youth counterculture ""tribes"" from Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Since then, the gatherings have extended to other areas in the United States as well as a number of different countries. The international gatherings generally take place during the summer, before August's full moon. According to Krivic, the exact locations of some of the Rainbow Gatherings are revealed through hand-drawn maps and presented to those who have attended a gathering in the past. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Krivic has had a diverse range of experiences at Rainbow Gatherings, and maintaining a consistent photographic process over the years has enabled him to witness firsthand the growth of his photography. Ever since his first Rainbow Gathering, Krivic has been using the same two film cameras and lenses. ""The gatherings didn't change,"" Krivic said, ""but my photography did change -- a lot. ... I consider photography differently now."" Krivic says a key consideration when taking photos was the use of film cameras as opposed to digital, which he believes do not fit in with the atmosphere of the gatherings. He also had to carefully decide who to photograph. ""I had some friends and I could take photos of them, and then eventually when I was going on and on, it just became like a family,"" he said. ""It's like people that you know for 20 years and you see them every year."" Just as every person sees a rainbow in their own unique way, ""Somewhere Under the Rainbow"" enables viewers to let their vision roam freely around every corner of the photos, leaving them to cultivate their own perspectives and ripen their imaginations. In one photo, Krivic takes viewers to Pakistan in 1998, where a man mesmerizes viewers as he stands in pristine blue water holding a mango in his hands. It's then 2003 in France. Light rays power through colossal trees, illuminating tents and tepees and dosing the atmosphere with warmth.

"(CNN)What does it take to help a single dolphin entangled in fishing line? In the recent case of a dolphin calf rescued off the eastern coast of Florida, about two days of effort involving seven boats and 35 people from 12 institutions and organizations. And that was after four weeks spent finding him and evaluating his situation to see whether it warranted intervention. With spring approaching, marine experts say it's a good reminder to look after your belongings when you take to the water. From plastic bags to swimming trunks to crab pots, marine life can get entangled in all manner of human debris. With limited time and resources, experts can't save them all. ""You really want to make sure you keep all your hands on your stuff,"" said Elizabeth Stratton, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries' assistant marine mammal stranding coordinator for the southeast region. ""We feel a special responsibility in cases where an animal's health is in danger because of debris introduced by humans,"" said Stratton, who was involved in last week's rescue. So where does an intervention begin? A couple spotted the calf off the coast of Fort Pierce with monofilament line wrapped around his rostrum, or snout. The mammal was riding the wake of their boat. They reported it January 18 to the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, which set out to find the calf and his mother. The group found the pair and took more pictures, which were sent to the NOAA Fisheries on February 9 for evaluation. The photos revealed monofilament line wrapped around the calf's upper jaw, cutting into the tissue to the bone, threatening his ability to eat or possibly leading to infection. Veterinarians who reviewed the photos deemed the injuries potentially life-threatening. ""We can't disentangle every animal,"" Stratton said, ""but If it comes back as life-threatening, we mobilize to do disentanglement."" The next step was to find the creatures again. Through characteristics on the mother's dorsal fin, the group was able to identify her through records on file and target her home range for a search. After a two-day search, the group found the dolphins on Friday and approached for intervention. The process took about an hour, from netting the calf and his mother to sending them on their way, Stratton said. Apart from the fishing line both mother and son were in good condition. Rescuers gave the calf a long-lasting antibiotic and radio-tagged the mother before releasing them to the ocean ""where they belong,"" Stratton said. The moral of the story for humans: ""Be conscious of your gear."" To report an injured marine mammal, call 877-WHALEHELP (877-942-5343).","It took about four weeks and an hour for rescuers to help a dolphin calf .

"(CNN)Two U.K. charities have stopped funding a Muslim advocacy group that had earlier helped ISIS's masked murderer ""Jihadi John,"" now identified as Mohammed Emwazi, before his radicalization, the group said. The human rights and advocacy group CAGE in London said it accepted the loss of funding from the Roddick Foundation and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust. But CAGE blamed a ""neo-conservative"" leadership on the U.K.'s Charity Commission for pressuring the two charities to halt funding. ""We respect their decision. We thank them for their past support. Both of these charities have played a significant role in contributing to the development of Muslim civil society here in the UK,"" CAGE spokesperson Amandla Thomas-Johnson said Friday. The termination of funding came after the Charity Commission ""took robust action"" and cited how ""public statements by CAGE officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities,"" the commission said in a statement. The commission didn't specify those statements by CAGE, but stated that ""in our view, those statements increased the threat to public trust and confidence in charity and raised clear questions for a charity considering funding CAGE's activities as to how the trustees of those charities could comply with their legal duties as charity trustees,"" the commission said. ""CAGE is not a charity but has been in part funded by British charities. As it is not a charity and given the nature of its work, and the controversy it has attracted, the Charity Commission has been concerned that such funding risked damaging public trust and confidence in charity,"" the commission said. ""As the regulator of charities, we expect all charities and trustees to ensure that all charitable funds are used according to their charity's purposes and in the way that the public would expect,"" the commission said. CAGE said it had worked with Emwazi and indicated that British authorities' tactics pushed him to radicalize. CAGE said that emails he sent the organization paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. Emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it, according to CAGE. Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner, was a ""polite"" and ""beautiful young man"" who would drop into the CAGE office with treats to thank the group for helping him, the group said. Emwazi came to CAGE in 2009 looking for support when he felt that British authorities were -- in the words of Asim Qureshi, CAGE's research director -- ""harassing"" him. But Emwazi has now been identified by U.S. officials as the masked man in ISIS videos showing beheadings of Western hostages. More than a dozen British administrative court documents obtained by CNN reveal British security services initially believed Emwazi was part of a radical West London recruitment network for terrorist groups in East Africa. The two charities gave sizeable funds to CAGE. The Rowntree Charitable Trust has given 271,250 British pounds, or almost $408,000, to CAGE since 2007, the commission said. The trust had pledged a total of 305,000 pounds, or almost $459,000, the commission said. The Roddick Foundation gave CAGE of 120,000 pounds, or more than $180,000 between 2009 and 2012, the commission said. In acknowledging the funding losses, CAGE criticized the commission. ""This is just another manifestation of their objective of pursuing a Cold War on British Islam,"" Thomas-Johnson said. ""CAGE will remain committed to its principle of speaking truth to power and calling for accountability and transparency. We will not hesitate in performing our role as whistleblowers and as advocates for due process."" Supporters of CAGE tweeted their criticism of the Charity Commission and the two philanthropies' decision to terminate funding. One supporter remarked that ""if @UK_CAGE is not there to provide us with a counter-narrative when it comes to 'radicalization'.... who will?!"" The commission said it will soon conclude its ""open cases"" into the two charities and publish a report and lessons "" for other charities which fund non-charitable bodies.""","UK Charity Commission takes ""robust action"" against Muslim advocacy group CAGE .

"(CNN)The tragic news that Germanwings Flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by a pilot deemed ""100% fit to fly"" challenges the common understanding of the phrase. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said co-pilot Andreas Lubitz apparently ""wanted to destroy the aircraft,"" taking advantage of the pilot leaving the cockpit and most likely refusing to open the cabin door after activating the plane's descent. The CEO of Lufthansa -- of which Germanwings is a subsidiary -- said Lubitz had been ""fit to fly."" But for most of us, the prosecutor's preliminary finding that the 28-year-old German purposefully caused the deaths of 150 people on March 24 puts him squarely outside that term. In fact ""fit to fly"" does not mean the pilot's psychological state has necessarily been assessed. Simon Mitchell is a pilot and visiting fellow at Cranfield University's Safety and Accident Investigation Centre in southern England. Over the last few years the aviation industry has been considering the amount of time spent examining pilots' skills compared to the time spent examining how they thought, Mitchell said. Many organizations had begun assessing the safety of particular airlines when considering which carriers their members should fly on, he said. ""It's not uncommon for those corporations to have in their assessment matrix a look at pilot selection procedures,"" Mitchell said. ""Increasingly we're looking at their all-round personalities and ability to work in teams and what they're like as people. ""Apart from 'do we want to ensure we haven't recruited somebody who might have some sort of mental disorder,' there's also a very good reason in a day-to-day way. You want to recruit somebody who works well in a team,"" he said. ""The airline industry is quite unique in the amount of trust and liability it places in the hands of a very small number of employees,"" Mitchell said. ""If you look at the value of the aircraft and the immeasurable value of the lives being flown in that aircraft, you come up to a huge number -- in the hundreds of millions, if not billions -- of dollars of risk associated with that asset. In effect, a medium to large sized company is being placed in the hands of a few employees. ""It is important that these airlines take a great deal of care -- not just about whether that pilot can fly -- but how fit that person is to carry that sort of responsibility."" On Thursday, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said the company's pilots did not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they were flying. But he said Lufthansa did consider an applicant's psychological state, along with other factors, when hiring pilots. ""We don't only look at competence, but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities,"" Spohr said. The pilot and co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 had passed the test the airline used to evaluate applicants, he said. But Mitchell said aviation regulations only required a physical  and not a psychiatric medical examination, looking at a potential pilot's fitness to fly in terms of factors such as heart attack risk. Those being examined were legally required to declare any mental disorder, but there was no standard psych testing from a regulatory point of view, he said, with airlines and industry bodies failing to reach consensus on types of tests to be used. ""The doctor is supposed to note any evident issues that he notices -- but what is he going to notice in half an hour's medical? The rest of it relies on your medical history and you being honest,"" Mitchell said. The Federal Aviation Administration told CNN that U.S. scheduled airline pilots must renew medical certificates every year if they're less than 40 years old and every six months if older. ""Pilots must complete an official FAA medical application form, and have a physical examination conducted by an FAA-designated Aviation Medical Examiner,"" it said. ""The FAA medical application form includes questions pertaining to the mental health of the pilot. The AME can defer a pilot to the FAA Office of Aerospace Medicine if he or she believes that additional psychological testing is indicated. All existing physical and psychological conditions and medications must be disclosed."" On its website, the FAA guidance for AMEs states: ""The FAA does not expect the Examiner to perform a formal psychiatric examination. However, the Examiner should form a general impression of the emotional stability and mental state of the applicant."" In terms of a pilot's fitness to fly on a particular day, Mitchell said attempts by many companies and airlines to introduce random drug and alcohol testing had hit problems with unions. ""When crew report for duty, they obviously are seen by other company personnel and they're also supposed to stop someone who's not fit for duty,"" he said, adding that was not a particularly robust system. ""It does rely on a professional crew member turning around and stopping the flight."" In the short term, the industry needed to be sensitive to the fact that the crash was ""an incredibly tragic event,"" Mitchell said. ""We need to be conscious in short-term not to exacerbate stress of the families in the first days,"" he said. ""It is important as an industry to recognize the amount of trust that's been put in our hands and ensure the system is robust enough to live up to that."" But managing an industry with global implications was complex, Mitchell said, pointing out that Lubitz was able to lock out the other pilot because of strengthened security measures introduced after the September 11 hijackings. ""It's horribly, tragically, ironic that an unintended consequence of trying to mitigate one risk has actually facilitated an equally horrendous act -- that wouldn't have been possible if we hadn't done something to try to mitigate the other risk."" Was 9/11 safety precaution a flaw? John Newsome and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","On Thursday the Marseille prosecutor said Flight 9525's co-pilot deliberately crashed .

"(CNN)A neglected maid, a hit man and a shoe expert are heading to theaters this weekend with the releases of ""Cinderella,"" ""Run All Night"" and ""The Cobbler."" Here's what The Hollywood Reporter's critics are saying about the weekend's new offerings (as well as which film will likely top the weekend's box office). Director Kenneth Branagh's film stars Cate Blanchett, Lily James, Richard Madden and Helena Bonham Carter in a retelling of the fairy tale about a young woman whose oppressive stepmother stands in the way of her feelings for a dashing prince. THR film critic David Rooney writes in his review that ""anyone nostalgic for childhood dreams of transformation will find something to enjoy in an uplifting movie that invests warm sentiment in universal themes of loss and resilience, experience and maturity."" More: The best and worst adaptations of ""Cinderella"" Liam Neeson, Ed Harris and Joel Kinnaman star in director Jaume Collet-Serra's crime film about a hit man trying to save his estranged son from a revenge plot. THR chief film critic Todd McCarthy writes in his review that the film is Neeson's ""latest slab of amped-up urban mayhem"" and ""consists entirely of angry threats, pointed guns, hiding out from and eluding same, and mad dashes down mean streets on foot and in vehicles."" More: Liam Neeson says he's quitting action movies in two years . Director Alex Gibney's documentary focuses on Scientology and its ties to Hollywood. ""This impeccably assembled and argued film represents a brave, timely intervention into debates around the organization that have been simmering for some time,"" writes THR film critic Leslie Felperin in her review. Adam Sandler, Steve Buscemi, Dustin Hoffman, Ellen Barkin and Dan Stevens star in director Thomas McCarthy's comedy about a dissatisfied shoe repairman who is magically able to live his customers' lives by wearing their footwear. THR film critic John DeFore describes the film as ""likeable but ordinary"" in his review. A woman isn't pleased when she learns her husband is cheating on her in director Anthony Burns' dark comedy. Katherine Heigl, Patrick Wilson and Jordana Brewster star. ""The kind of blithely confident, creatively impoverished dud that leaves you slightly stunned someone greenlighted it, the movie has the distinction of feeling like a bad idea from its very first frames,"" according to THR film critic Jon Frosch's review. More ""Cinderella"": Lily James, Richard Madden guess why British actors keep getting cast in Disney fairy tales . Pianist Seymour Bernstein is the subject of this documentary from director Ethan Hawke. THR film critic Stephen Farber writers in his review that ""the film is a loving portrait of Seymour Bernstein,"" although ""one might want to know a little more about his personal history."" ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter.

"(CNN)What's better than the sun on a March day in Europe, at the tail end of winter with spring on the doorstep? No sun, apparently. That was the verdict of many around the continent, who found Friday morning's solar eclipse picture perfect. Millions from around North Africa, the Middle East as well as Europe woke up with a chance to see the rare cosmic event. For some of them, it was a partial eclipse; but others -- say if you were at the North Pole, or in Svalbard or the Faroe Islands between Iceland and Norway -- got the full deal. Such eclipses are basically as old as the galaxy itself, happening when the moon and sun are at just the right distance from the Earth and they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky -- even though the sun is actually about 400 times larger. An eclipse happens when the moon passes right in front of the sun, blocking the sunlight and casting a shadow on the Earth. That means what used to be morning suddenly looks like nighttime again, until the sun and moon get out of each other's way. Staring at the sun anytime can be a bit dangerous, even when it's there, not there, then there again during an eclipse. That's where the term ""eclipse blindness"" -- which is really retinal burns -- comes from. Luckily, a lot of those peering into the skies Friday came prepared. At least that was the case for famous Bayern Munich footballers Xabi Alonso and Pepe Reina, who looked cool looking up in their 3-D movie-type glasses. Or a bunch of children at Stockport Grammar, a British school not far from Manchester. One of them looked more like a welder than a stargazer but didn't seem to mind, giving a thumbs-up to the view. Not everyone was similarly enthused; not because they don't love a good eclipse, but because they don't like a bad one. CNN's Nick Thompson in London, for instance, went out hoping for an out-of-this-world experience and instead saw little more than a bunch of clouds. He wasn't alone, as many in Britain in particular didn't get the big show they'd hoped for. Clouds be damned, some folks there used a sun costume, along with an Earth-and-moon prop, to put on a show of their own. If the sun won't come out for you, then you might as well be the sun, their reasoning went. Even in the United Kingdom, whether you were Glasgow University students cheering when a glimpse of the eclipse emerged from the clouds or a bird soaring the sky, there was a lot of enthusiasm for the eclipse. And there were even more cheers elsewhere, in Berlin, Beirut and beyond. Norwegians, especially, got some of the most spectacular perspectives. Eclipses aren't everyday events, and they're getting less common. While there will be more full eclipses, they will get rarer and rarer as the moon moves away from the Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters (about 1.5 inches) every year. That means there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun. But don't sweat it just yet: NASA calculates this will take about 563 million years, meaning there's still time to catch another eclipse. Weather permitting, of course. CNN's Dave Gilbert contributed to this report.","The moon blocks the sun, casts a shadow across parts of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East .
The view of the resulting eclipse is particularly impressive in places like Norway .
It's also seen around Europe, though clouds obscure the views of many in England ."
"Selma, Alabama (CNN)In a passionate speech about racial progress in America, President Barack Obama on Saturday told thousands of people who gathered here to commemorate the 50th anniversary of ""Bloody Sunday"" that ""our march is not yet finished. But we are getting closer."" Obama emphasized that a day of commemoration is not enough to repay the debt paid by the marchers who were brutally beaten 50 years ago as they demonstrated for voting rights. ""If Selma taught us anything, it's that our work is never done,"" the President said near Edmund Pettus Bridge, where the confrontation between authorities and marchers was captured in film and photographs that jolted the nation. Read President Obama's prepared remarks . The President said that what civil rights marchers did years ago ""will reverberate through the ages. Not because the change they won was preordained; not because their victory was complete; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible; that love and hope can conquer hate."" He hailed the marchers as heroes. The President said that ""the Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing, but they gave courage to millions. They held no elected office. But they led a nation."" The ""Bloody Sunday"" anniversary marks 50 years from the day hundreds of people were brutally attacked by Alabama state troopers as they marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, to protest racial discrimination in voter registration. About 600 people participated in the planned 50-mile journey on March 7, 1965. The marchers were protesting discrimination that kept black people from voting. But as the marchers approached the foot of the bridge, state troopers used force and tear gas to push them back. As events were underway Saturday in Selma, hundreds of people marched across the Brooklyn Bridge in New York to symbolize their unity with the Alabama commemoration. Television coverage of the event in 1965 triggered national outrage and eventually led Congress to pass the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, which mandated federal oversight over elections in states with histories of discrimination. 50 years later: Memories from 'Bloody Sunday' nurse . Many of the nation's leaders, activists and celebrities were in Selma on Saturday attending various activities taking place in memory of the historic event. On Saturday, Rep. John Lewis -- one of the demonstrators bloodied by troopers 50 years ago -- and nearly 100 other members of Congress from both parties joined the President  at the bridge in Selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of Pettus, a Confederate general who was also a Ku Klux Klan leader. ""We must use this moment to recommit ourselves to do all we can to finish this work. There's still work to be done,"" said Lewis, adding this is an opportunity to ""redeem the soul of America."" The President said that though progress has been made, racism is still too prevalent in America. ""We just need to open our eyes, and ears, and hearts, to know that this nation's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us,"" he said.  ""We know the march is not yet over, the race is not yet won, and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character -- requires admitting as much."" The President called on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act, first passed in 1965. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the law that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to ""pre-clear"" any changes to the law with the federal government before implementing them. Efforts to revive key provisions of the act have stalled in Congress. John Lewis's memories of the march . Reflecting a sense of change in the half century since Bloody Sunday, and with Selma again in a national media spotlight, the mood in the crowd Saturday was of unity, and talks were focused on how to move America forward. But some current Selma residents worried that after the dignitaries leave their town -- with a population 82% black and with more than 40% of its people living below the national poverty level -- will fade from view except for its historical significance. Many black residents of Selma say they still live in a divisive society and still feel the sting of racism, with true change yet to come. Geraldine Martin, 59, has lived in Selma all her life. She was 9 years old on ""Bloody Sunday"" and with her mother had just welcomed a little sister, Belinda, to the world on that day. The two sisters grew up in Selma less than a decade apart. They graduated from Selma High School and both had to make decisions about whether to stay in their hometown when few opportunities existed for young people. ""We need to reevaluate our education system,"" said Geraldine, who became a special education teacher at Selma High.  ""We need incentives for young people. I am hoping today's events will help us move forward."" Opinion: Selma's historic bridge deserves a better name . Belinda shook her head. She left Selma after high school and now lives in Atlanta. Her view of Selma has changed over the years -- looking in from the outside. ""I don't see how Selma will move forward without togetherness,"" said Belinda. ""There is no diversity in Selma. People don't live together. ""I want to ask white people: 'So why are you so angry at us? Is it really the color of my skin or something deeper?'"" Maybe, she said, the attention on Selma this weekend will help spark a relevant dialogue. 50 years later: The house where MLK stayed . CNN's Moni Basu reported from Selma. CNN's Slma Shelbayah wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Steve Almasy and Douglas Brinkley contributed to this report.","President Obama calls for renewal of Voting Rights Act .

"(CNN)Marvel is going back to war. The massively popular superhero entertainment factory has the third ""Captain America"" movie on the way, ""Civil War,"" which will include Iron Man and quite possibly, the new Spider-Man. It's based on a story arc from almost a decade ago, which tackled issues of freedom versus security, with the two heroes going toe to toe against one another. This summer, Marvel plans to revisit that storyline as part of the much larger return of ""Secret Wars,"" its biggest crossover event of the 1980s. The effects of this will be huge to the comics, ending 33 of the company's titles. CNN spoke to writer Charles Soule, who has gained acclaim for his work on ""Superman/Wonder Woman,"" ""Swamp Thing,"" The Death of Wolverine,"" ""She-Hulk"" and more. He gave us the scoop on the return of ""Civil War,"" one year before it hits the big screen. CNN: What can fans expect from your ""Civil War"" storyline? Soule: ""Secret Wars"" is an opportunity to revisit some of the great Marvel stories of the past. One of those is ""Civil War,"" and I got the call to work on that. ""Civil War"" happened in 2006 and 2007, and in that story Captain America and Iron Man went after each other based on an ideological difference on superheroes in the world. What I'm doing is taking that story in a different direction. CNN: Will this be a way for those who are interested in the upcoming movie to dive into that story? Soule: Absolutely. If you look at the ideas that that story had, Iron Man thought superheroes should have to register with the government, and become something of a police force. Captain America thought that that was restricting the central freedoms of this country. It was a debate of security versus freedom. We're taking that basic idea and expanding it to a larger canvas. The Registration Act is all in the past at this point. It's more of a world drastically changed based on a superhero war, and it's a huge story and it's fun to be able to involve every Marvel character there is. CNN: Is this one of the biggest stories you've worked on? Soule: I've been on big books but this one feels huge. It affects every character in one way or another, and it deals with some central issues to the modern world. That's not always something you get to do in a Marvel story. CNN: So this will have many twists and turns away from the original story? Soule: The idea is to take some of the events in the original storyline and spin them off into entirely new stories. Without spoiling, this deals with a world that has been ravaged for quite some time when we pick up the story. I felt the original ""Civil War"" explored those questions very well. If I was going to play in this sandbox, I wanted to ask my own questions.","This summer, the popular 1980s ""Secret War"" comic book storyline will return .
Story will affect every Marvel comic, ending 33 titles .
2000s ""Civil War"" story will also be revisiting, pitting characters against each other ."
"(CNN)It recalled one of the most memorable moments in comic book history, but for critics on social media, one comic book cover went too far, and it's now been pulled. DC Comics pulled the cover for the upcoming ""Batgirl"" #41, which portrays the Joker threatening a frightened Batgirl with a gun, with ""Joker makeup"" on her mouth. The Twitter hashtag #changethecover had been trending since Friday, when the cover was revealed. It's a variant, aka an optional cover, which tends to grab the attention of collectors but won't be the main cover seen in most stores. For the month of June, DC's variant covers are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the iconic villain. The cover recalls Barbara ""Batgirl"" Gordon's encounter with the Joker in the classic story ""The Killing Joke."" In it, he brutally attacked Barbara, kidnapping her, and it was heavily implied that she was sexually assaulted. After being shot, the character remained in a wheelchair for decades, until DC retconned Barbara's fate in 2011, allowing her to walk again and be Batgirl. The criticism of the cover spread over a few days, though others defended it with their own hashtags. DC Comics (owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN) said in a statement late Monday that artist Rafael Albuquerque's cover was going to be pulled. ""Regardless if fans like Rafael Albuquerque's homage to Alan Moore's THE KILLING JOKE graphic novel from 25 years ago, or find it inconsistent with the current tonality of the Batgirl books -- threats of violence and harassment are wrong and have no place in comics or society,"" they said. ""We stand by our creative talent, and per Rafael's request, DC Comics will not publish the Batgirl variant. "" Albuquerque said in his own statement, ""My Batgirl variant cover artwork was designed to pay homage to a comic that I really admire, and I know is a favorite of many readers. 'The Killing Joke' is part of Batgirl's canon and artistically, I couldn't avoid portraying the traumatic relationship between Barbara Gordon and the Joker."" He continued, ""For me, it was just a creepy cover that brought up something from the character's past that I was able to interpret artistically. But it has become clear, that for others, it touched a very important nerve. I respect these opinions and, despite whether the discussion is right or wrong, no opinion should be discredited. He concluded, ""My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art. For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled. I'm incredibly pleased that DC Comics is listening to my concerns and will not be publishing the cover art in June as previously announced."" Albuquerque added in a tweet on Monday night that he was never threatened (the ""threats"" DC referenced were aimed at those objecting to the cover, per ""Batgirl"" writer Cameron Stewart). Stewart tweeted more: ""I stand behind Rafael as an artist and a friend, and think he made the right decision. The cover was not seen or approved by anyone on Team Batgirl and was completely at odds with what we are doing with the comic.

"(CNN)Gunmen killed 19 people and sent tourists scrambling for cover in a siege at a museum in Tunisia's capital on Wednesday. The North African nation's Prime Minister called it a cowardly terrorist attack and warned that three suspects were still on the loose. Tunisian security forces killed two attackers as they ended the hostage siege at the Bardo Museum in Tunis, Prime Minister Habib Essid said. But the death toll, which included 17 tourists and at least one Tunisian security officer, could climb. Polish, Italian, German and Spanish tourists were among those killed, Essid said, with another 20 foreign tourists and two Tunisians wounded in the attack. ""It's a cowardly attack mainly targeting the economy of Tunisia,"" the Prime Minister said. ""We should unite to defend our country."" The scene played out at a popular tourist destination in the heart of Tunisia's capital in a building linked to where the nation's parliament meets. Lawmakers there were in the middle of a committee meeting when they heard gunfire erupt. ""The tourists were frightened and they were running in different directions. We opened the doors and we got them to enter to the Parliament,"" lawmaker Mehrezia Labidi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. An administrator told lawmakers to lay down on the ground as a gunbattle broke out between terrorists and police, said Sabrine Ghoubatini, a member of parliament. It wasn't long before the building was evacuated. Photos on Twitter showed security forces in bulletproof vests and black helmets and masks, guns drawn, in the area. Authorities set up a large security cordon around the targeted museum. Rescuers carried wounded tourists away on stretchers. Essid didn't specify where the attackers came from. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui called them Islamists in remarks on national radio. The museum, housed in a 19th century palace, bills itself as ""a jewel of Tunisian heritage."" Its exhibits showcase Tunisian art, culture and history, and it boasts a collection of mosaics, including one of the poet Virgil, as well as marble sculptures, furniture, jewels and other items. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. But it happened just days after a Tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was coming soon, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. In his message, the jihadi claimed to belong to Jund al-Khilafah in Tunisia, a group that in December pledged allegiance to ISIS, even though that vow didn't seem to have fully registered with the Islamist extremist group. His post comes after an ISIS fighter in Raqqa, Syria, recently appeared in a video questioning why jihadis in Tunisia had not pledged fealty. ""This raises the possibility that the museum attack could be ISIS' debut on the Tunisian stage, timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from Tunisian jihadis for maximum impact,"" CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. Tunisia has seen far less militant violence than other nations in the region that were part of the Arab Spring uprisings, like neighboring Libya. But it hasn't been immune to it. The government has been battling a jihadist presence in the Chaambi Mountains. There have been several apparent political assassinations. And in February, the country's Interior Ministry announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Up to 3,000 Tunisians are believed to have traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight as jihadists, more than any other country, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization in London. ""There are hundreds that have returned from the battlefield, yet we haven't seen this kind of activity in Tunisia yet,"" said Rick Francona, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer and CNN military analyst. ""I think it was only a matter of time. And today was the day."" Tunisia is where the Arab Spring took root in December 2010, when a poor, 26-year-old man set himself on fire in front of a Tunisian government building after police confiscated his vegetable cart, sparking protests there. Protests throughout the Middle East and North Africa soon followed, with revolutions toppling governments in some countries. While violence and instability have continued to shake Egypt, Libya and Syria, in many ways, Tunisia has been the exception, with The Economist going so far as to name it ""Country of the Year"" for 2014. ""The idealism engendered by the Arab spring has mostly sunk in bloodshed and extremism, with a shining exception: Tunisia,"" the magazine wrote. ""... Its economy is struggling and its polity is fragile; but Tunisia's pragmatism and moderation have nurtured hope in a wretched region and a troubled world."" While it has been more peaceful than other countries, Tunisia has seen its share of violence and political turmoil. There was cautious optimism after the October 2011 elections -- the country's first since its independence in 1956 -- that involved 60 political parties and thousands of independent candidates vying for seats in the country's new Constitutional Assembly. The next two years saw some crackdowns on media freedom, as well as criticisms of efforts to criminalize blasphemy and inject strict religious discourse in mosques. In 2013, two opposition leaders were assassinated. But analysts say Wednesday's attack could have been carried out by people who care more about fomenting terror or establishing a strict Islamic caliphate -- ISIS' aim -- than Tunisian politics. The country has also been batting socioeconomic problems such as youth unemployment. Young people who can't get jobs are finding that joining extremist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda is a way out. Up until now, these recruits have largely done their fighting away from home. Experts think that by taking the fight to Tunisia, they'll hurt their cause not just by hurting the tourism-reliant economy, but also by alienating most of their countrymen. ""They're already isolated and marginalized, and they further isolate and marginalize themselves by these actions,"" said Mubin Shaikh, a former undercover counterterrorism operative. ""... This will just further isolate and alienate these groups from the rest of the public."" Travelers warned of risks as Tunisia reels from attack . CNN's Samira Said, Ashley Fantz, Alanne Orjoux, Gul Tuysuz, Sandrine Amiel, Antonia Mortensen, Laura Perez Maestro, Vasco Cotovio, as well as journalists Shokri Shihi, Barbie Latza Nadeau and Livia Borghese, contributed to this report.","17 tourists are killed in an attack at a museum in Tunisia's capital .

"(CNN)At least a dozen tourists on two cruises that visited the Tunisian capital, Tunis, are among more than 20 people who were gunned down this week at the country's Bardo National Museum, officials said. Details of the victims in Wednesday's attack have been slow to emerge. Some of the bodies remained unidentified at a morgue, a forensic official said Friday. Here's what is known so far: . Among the first victims to be named was Briton Sally Adey. The UK Foreign Office confirmed her identity. She was a 57-year-old retired solicitor who was on a dream vacation with her husband, Robert, Britain's Telegraph newspaper reported. The couple were married in 1984 and have two children -- Molly, a 20-year-old university student, and Harry, a 23-year-old musician, the newspaper said. Julia Holden, a close friend of the Adeys, gave a statement to CNN that said, ""Sally Adey was a much loved daughter, wife and mother. The family are devastated by her loss. They are also saddened for others who have lost people they love, and for those who have been hurt."" Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said consular staff were helping Adey's family. ""The extremists, the terrorists, they hate democracy,"" UK Prime Minister David Cameron said. ""They hate the idea that people should be able to choose their own government. But we must not let democracy, freedom, the rule of law, the things that we hold dear and people in Tunisia hold dear -- we must not let them be defeated or undermined by these extremists and terrorists. ""That is the battle we are engaged in, but I'm confident, if we stick to our values, we will win through."" Two more victims were named as Spanish couple Antoni Cirera Perez and Dolores Sanchez Rami. They were on a cruise that stopped in Tunis. Francisco Cabezas, a sportswriter with the newspaper El Mundo, wrote that his neighbors for eight years had loved children and walking in the mountains. Perez loved Formula 1 races. The sportswriter wrote that he recently invited the couple over to meet his baby daughter, Adria. They were ecstatic to hear the cries of a baby, he said. Perez instructed him softly, ""Let her cry, that is what she has to do."" President Francois Hollande, who said he stood firm with Tunisia, confirmed that three French citizens were killed and seven others wounded. He told reporters at an EU Council meeting in Brussels, Belgium, that two of the wounded were in serious condition. The five who are slightly hurt are expected to return shortly to France. Bruno Masarotto, a spokesman for the Town Hall of Aussillon, in southern France, confirmed that Jean-Claude Tissier, a former municipal councilor for Aussillon, was one of the French citizens killed. Tissier, 71, was a hairdresser and had two sons, one of whom is deceased, he said. Fellow hairdresser Serge Fournes said he and Tissier were part of the same theater group. He said it was a ""paradox"" that his friend, who was passionate about art, should die in a museum. Fournes said Tissier lived with his girlfriend. Media reports said the couple was on vacation together, but the girlfriend's condition wasn't known. A second victim was named as Christophe Tinois, 59, from Castelsarrasin, in southern France. The Castelsarrasin Town Hall confirmed his death and said Tinois had worked with the horse-riding community there. He had at least two daughters. Friend Jean-Luc Terriers said the girls' mother died about two or three years ago and that Tinois took care of her until the end. He had recently met another woman and they were in Tunis on a cruise, he said. It wasn't clear whether she was hurt in the attack. The Town Hall has organized a tribute ceremony for Tinois on Saturday morning. The name of the third French victim has not yet been confirmed. Two Colombians were killed, Javier Camelo, and his mother, Miriam Martinez Camelo. Javier Camelo also held Australian citizenship. His father survived the attack. He is a retired Colombian army general. The family was on a trip to celebrate the son's graduation. Four of the victims were from the country's northern Piedmont region. The media office of Turin City Hall named them as: Orazio Conte, 54, a Turin city administration employee; Antonella Sesino, also 54 and a city administration employee; Francesco Caldara, 64, a retiree; and Giuseppina Biella, 70. A vigil was held Thursday night in Turin to support the families of the victims and stand against terrorism. In a telegram from the Vatican, Pope Francis expressed ""strong condemnation to all the acts against peace and the holiness of human life."" The Italian Foreign Ministry told CNN that six Italian tourists were wounded. Russia's Foreign Ministry confirmed the death of a tourist, Galina Potapenko, who was born in 1962, according to Russian state news agency Tass. Her remains were ""found among the earlier unidentified bodies of foreign tourists,"" it said. Another tourist, Nadezhda Lukyanova, was being treated for a wound to her arm at a military hospital in Tunis, Tass cited the ministry as saying. The two women had met up in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, where Potapenko lived, and traveled to Italy together, the Russian Embassy said earlier, according to Tass. They reached Tunisia on an Italian cruise. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said three Japanese nationals were killed and three others wounded. Public broadcaster NHK and other local media said the dead were all women: Machiyo Narisawa, 66; Chiemi Miyazaki, 49; and Miyazaki's 22-year-old daughter, Haruka Miyazaki. Haruka Miyazaki had just graduated from a university, the media outlets reported. Two Poles and a Belgian were listed among those killed. Three Tunisians were also among the dead. CNN's Junko Ogura, Karl Penhaul, Ray Sanchez, Livia Borghese, Jessica King, Claudia Rebaza, Richard Allen Greene, Sandrine Amiel, Emma Burrows and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Details of the victims of the attack on the Tunisian museum start to emerge .

"(CNN)Three and a half decades after calling for homosexuals to be stoned, former Bob Jones University President Bob Jones III has apologized. ""I take personal ownership of this inflammatory rhetoric,"" Jones said.  ""This reckless statement was made in the heat of a political controversy 35 years ago."" The weekend apology came days after the conservative Christian school in South Carolina received a petition asking for an apology for a statement Jones made to the Associated Press in 1980 at the White House. ""I'm sure this will be greatly misquoted,"" Jones said at the time. ""But it would not be a bad idea to bring the swift justice today that was brought in Israel's day against murder and rape and homosexuality. I guarantee it would solve the problem post-haste if homosexuals were stoned, if murderers were immediately killed as the Bible commands."" When he made the comments, Jones was part of a group of fundamentalist ministers who went to the White House with 70,000 signatures on a petition opposed to extending provisions of the Civil Rights Act to homosexuals. ""Upon now reading these long-forgotten words, they seem to me as words belonging to a total stranger -- were my name not attached,"" Jones said in Saturday's statement.  ""I cannot erase them, but wish I could, because they do not represent the belief of my heart or the content of my preaching."" Bob Jones University has long been a center of controversy for its fundamentalist stances. In 1975, the school adopted rules banning interracial dating. BJU received national attention on the issue in 2000 when George W. Bush, then a presidential candidate, visited the campus.  The uproar over the ban prompted the school to drop it. The petition by BJUnity, a group that bills itself as a network ""for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and straight affirming people affected by fundamentalist Christianity,"" garnered more than 1,900 signatures. ""We are grateful that Bob Jones III has taken responsibility for these words; words that have caused deep harm for many more people than any of us knows,"" the group's website said.  ""This means a lot to us because it represents the beginning of a change in the rhetoric and conversation.""","Bob Jones III suggested homosexuals should be stoned in 1980 .

"Seyne-les-Alpes, France (CNN)It's a dangerous task as well as a grim one. The rescue workers battling to gather the pulverized pieces of Germanwings Flight 9525 and the remains of the 150 people on board must contend with high winds as well as treacherous terrain. They climb up a rugged mountain, appearing to cling to its side by their fingernails. Bit by bit, bag by bag, high wire daredevils hoist body bags hundreds of feet up to waiting helicopters, trying to remain stable in the high winds.  Rescuers pin red flags on the earth when they discover new fragments. Winched down from helicopters on to the steep, icy slopes, where debris lies scattered across hundreds of meters, workers have had to be tied together in two-person teams. One is there to carry out the investigation and recovery. The second is charged with ensuring their safety as they're buffeted by the weather. Complicating matters, very few of the bodies have been found whole, Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations, told CNN on Friday. And winds have picked up, making it difficult for helicopters to ferry the workers to the site in the French Alps in the first place, he said. Authorities have deployed 45 Alpine police officers to help forensics teams -- not accustomed to working in mountain ravines -- recover the bodies safely, Naffrechoux said. His team is based out of Seyne-les-Alpes, a normally sleepy Alpine village that since Tuesday's crash has been transformed into a hub for the recovery operation. The leaders of Germany, France and Spain have visited. The families of the victims have laid flowers and prayed at a nearby memorial. Journalists have flocked to the spot as they report the latest developments. Meanwhile, the rescue workers have continued their hazardous mission. Before anything could be recovered, the position of the bodies and debris had to be mapped. Human remains must be treated with due respect despite the tricky conditions. The workers are now removing more bodies from the site, Naffrechoux said. The priority remains to find all the bodies and the elusive second ""black box,"" the plane's flight data recorder, he said. Investigators hope, once found, it could yield more clues into what happened on the flight deck of the Germanwings plane before it slammed into the mountainside at about 430 miles per hour. Already, the Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, has revealed that cockpit audio indicated that German co-pilot Andreas Lubitz ""wanted to destroy the aircraft."" The recovery teams are trying to construct a road to access the site more quickly and aid the transportation of bodies to a DNA testing center where they are kept in refrigerated units, said Naffrechoux. It's hoped the process will take 10 to 15 days, depending on weather, he said. Testimonials posted by France's Interior Ministry from rescue and recovery workers at the scene also give an insight into the tough conditions at the remote crash site. Cmdr. Emmanuel G., of the Criminal Research Institute from the National Gendarmerie, said it was a ""really complicated"" process. ""We are working in two-person teams, whether it's alongside (police) mountain guides, the local gendarmes or the alpine firemen and emergency teams,"" he said. ""We do not know how to continue in this situation otherwise, we really need them to ensure our security at all times."" ""It's the first time police technicians and gendarmes are working together,"" an unnamed technician in one of those two-person teams is quoted as saying. ""We have total trust in each other. He's holding my life in his hands."" CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Nic Robertson reported from Seyne-les-Alpes and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London.

"(CNN)Six months ago this week Omar received a panicked phone call from his friend and fellow student. ""I was in my dormitory writing a paper and a friend called me in desperation from a bus. He said they were being shot by police,"" Omar explained. He has not heard from his friend since. Omar is a student at the Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Teacher Training College of Ayotzinapa, in Guerrero state. His friend is one of 43 students who were subjected to enforced disappearance in September of 2014. As the days and weeks passed, the Mexican authorities stalled and obfuscated. Despite worldwide attention on the issue, they have, for months, failed to properly investigate all lines of the case, especially the worrying allegations of complicity by armed forces. In January, I traveled to the Ayotzinapa college. There, in the college hall, surrounded by murals of Mexico's revolutionary leaders, I met the families of the disappeared students. For the past six months, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers, as well as other relatives and community members, have been campaigning relentlessly, demanding answers from the authorities about what happened to their loved ones. It was an emotional and difficult meeting; there were tears of sadness and disappointment. Mothers and fathers spoke of counting the seconds since they last saw their sons, and expressed frustration at how they and their boys have been portrayed as troublemakers by the authorities and the media. These are people who have lived in poverty, whose communities have been historically abandoned by the state; for many, their missing son was the first of their families to go to school. Now, so many hopes and dreams have been shattered. I have witnessed all kinds of human tragedies, but there can be few things as painful as the torment of not knowing where a loved one is. The past months have been a roller-coaster for these families, and all of us who support and accompany their struggles. But a constant factor has been the Mexican government's failure to respond effectively and address these grave human rights violations. A prime example of this is how, on November 7, 2014, the authorities announced that human remains had been uncovered in a rubbish dump and a nearby river in Cocula, and the then-attorney general Jesús Murillo Karam announced weeks later that he was prepared to close the case. According to the prosecutor, he was satisfied that the findings of his office's investigation were sufficient proof of what happened. However, only one of the missing students has been identified through DNA tests. Other human remains are still being tested, and it seems that the whole investigation so far has been based only on the testimonies of three gang members. You don't have to be attorney general to know that this is far from conclusive proof. But amidst the sadness of the families I met, there was a calm and steely resolve. These 43 mothers and fathers have decided they cannot accept the silence or half-answers they have been given by the government, instead they are demanding the truth. One father explained to me how the horror of that day has transformed them all from peasant farmers to detectives and campaigners. If the authorities won't push for proper investigations, then they will. They have been campaigning vocally for the truth ever since. The tragic reality is that these 43 students were only the most recent we have heard of in a long line of the disappeared. According to official figures, 24,748 people have disappeared or gone missing in Mexico since 2007, and almost half of them during the current administration of President Peña Nieto. Fortunately the international community has stepped up. Recently the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights established a Group of Independent Experts to review the official investigation into the enforced disappearance of the students. In February, the United Nations' Committee on Enforced Disappearances produced recommendations on how to deal with disappearances in Mexico. The committee concluded that there is a context of generalized disappearances in a great part of the country. It has asked the government to prevent acts of intimidation and harassment toward the families of the disappeared and has suggested setting up a DNA database of missing people and a registry of disappearances. However, even these international calls are going unheeded. Just hours after the U.N. committee published its conclusions and recommendations, the Mexican government disregarded them. This is a worrying sign that the government is not stepping up and taking this human rights crisis seriously. On March 3, Mexico appointed Arely Gómez González as the new federal attorney general. We had hoped that she would forge on where her predecessor failed and get to the root of the corruption and impunity that lies behind this terrible tragedy. However, her recent statements -- that the disappearance of the 43 students is an ""isolated case"" and that there is no confirmation of grave human rights violations in this case -- are shocking. For Omar and the others waiting for news, it is only full accountability and pursuit of justice that can address the horrors they have seen and experienced. ""The government's response has been nothing but disrespectful and insensitive,"" Omar said. ""I'm alarmed about what happened but I'm not afraid. We will never give up our fight for justice."" Amnesty International and I will be there alongside them every step of the way.","Six months ago, 43 students from Ayotzinapa College in Mexico disappeared .

"(CNN)An investigation by the Charlottesville, Virginia, Police Department has found no ""substantive basis"" to support the allegations of a University of Virginia student that she was gang raped at a fraternity there.  The allegations were first revealed in a story in Rolling Stone magazine that was initially widely circulated and then increasingly widely doubted. ""That doesn't mean that something terrible didn't happen to Jackie"" on the day in question, Police Chief Tim Longo said regarding the UVA student and her allegations.  And Longo said he welcomes any further information that may still be out there. That said, there remains one thing we certainly do know —  that gang rapes just like what Jackie originally alleged do happen -- too often, and all over America. Here's one measure: Today the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics released a new report showing that 80% of college rapes and sexual assaults go unreported to police, and 67% of such attacks by non-students go unreported. It would be a terrible and infuriating mistake to use the confusion around Jackie's story as a convenient way to discount this reality. While Rolling Stone's reporting was clearly shoddy, for example, some writers who initially poked holes in Jackie's story did so for ideological motives.  For instance, even before the reporting lapses were revealed, conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg called Jackie's story unbelievable.  ""It is not credible,"" Goldberg wrote in the Los Angeles Times.  ""I don't believe it."" Instead, Goldberg insisted, Jackie's account was ""a convenient conversation for an exposé of rape culture,"" something, incidentally, Goldberg also doubts to be real.  ""'Rape culture' suggests that there is a large and obvious belief system that condones and enables rape as an end in itself in America,"" Goldberg later wrote in National Review.   It's all hogwash, says Goldberg, alleging that the very idea of ""rape culture"" is just ""an elaborate political lie intended to strengthen the hand of activists."" In other words, whatever the reality of what happened to Jackie, Goldberg and others were skeptical because they simply don't believe rapes like that happen with the participation of groups of assailants, let alone the complicity of bystanders. This is where they're mistaken. On October 24, 2009, in Richmond, California, a 15-year-old girl was repeatedly raped by a group of young men in a courtyard outside their high school homecoming dance.  Six assailants were eventually tried and ultimately pleaded guilty or were convicted.  Over two hours, as the assault occurred, as many as 20 other people watched. ""As people announced over time that this was going on, more people came to see, and some actually participated,"" said Lt. Mark Gagan of the Richmond Police Department.  The witnesses didn't report the crime to police. On August 12, 2012, a 16-year-old girl who was incapacitated by alcohol was raped by two high school football players in Steubenville, Ohio.  In the backseat of a car and later in the basement of a house, the two assailants stripped their victim naked and took turns, one inserting his fingers into her vagina, the other forcing his penis into her mouth.  This is not in dispute.  Both football players were convicted of the crime. As the crimes were taking place, friends took pictures that were shared with other friends.  Ultimately, Ohio investigators confiscated 17 cell phones used in sharing the pictures.  Some of those at the party even posted pictures of the unresponsive girl, being carried by her wrists and ankles, on Twitter with words like ""rape"" and ""drunk girl.""   In Steubenville, four adults have been indicted after being accused of covering up the incident, including the school superintendent. On May 11, 2014, an 18-year-old woman was allegedly sexually assaulted by three students at a party after their high school prom. The three alleged assailants, all prominent athletes, have been charged with multiple counts of aggravated assault and are awaiting trial.  According to police, at least one person witnessed the assault in the room where it took place and several other people at the party knew it was happening.  But no one stopped it. In June 2014, a 16-year-old girl went to a party where she was allegedly drugged and raped.  She doesn't remember what happened, only passing out and waking up the next morning with her clothes messed up.  But weeks later, the young woman received text messages of photos showing her unconscious and undressed, apparently taken at the same party.  The photos went viral on the Internet, with Twitter users posting photos of themselves in the same awkward position, mocking the alleged victim.  When the Houston Press asked someone who posted such a picture on Twitter why he did it, he simply said he was ""bored at 1 a.m. and decided to wake up"" his Twitter feed. This is by no means an exhaustive account of incidents in which young women have been gang raped while bystanders have either cheered the crime, hidden it or stood by in silence.  And while we don't know whether something terrible happened to Jackie, it would be truly tragic if we let this incident cast doubt on all allegations of rape and sexual assault.   Too often rapists are given the benefit of the doubt, even in the case of overwhelming evidence, while female victims are shamed (see multiple Bill Cosby allegations). Anti-feminists have it wrong. No one, myself included, wanted Jackie's story to be true.  That's absurd and offensive.  We should not use this case to undermine the pervasive reality of rape culture. Whether Jackie was or wasn't sexually assaulted doesn't change the fact that many women have experienced sexual assault. When feminists raise our voices about rape and sexual assault, we aren't cheering on victimhood.  We're screaming for something to be done.","Sally Kohn: Facts hazy on UVA rape allegations, but victim-blaming is back in the mix .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN)At least six people have died and more than 60 were injured after the roof of a partially built cement factory collapsed Thursday in southwestern Bangladesh, police and fire officials told CNN. Many of those injured were in critical condition, said Mohammed Bakir Hossain, the top government physician of Bagerhat district. Mohammad Niazmur Rahman, the fire and civil defense official coordinating the search and rescue effort, said early Thursday evening that two people had been pulled alive from the rubble and as many as 30 others are believed to be still trapped. Deputy inspector general of police of Khulna range SM Monir Uz Zaman said the number of those still trapped was unclear ""as we're not sure how many people were working inside."" The collapse took place around 1 p.m. (3 a.m. ET) in Mongla, a port city in the Asian nation's Bagerhat District. The factory is owned by Sena Kalyan Sangstha, a welfare organization for former Bangladeshi troops and their beneficiaries, according to Rahman and other local officials. Video from Boishakhi TV showed medical workers tending to the injured as they were wheeled into a local medical facility caked in dust. Deadly incidents at factories and other buildings, sadly, are nothing new in Bangladesh. The worst happened on April 24, 2013, when a nine-story building that housed five garment factories collapsed. Rescuers managed to save the lives of more than 2,400 people, but more than 1,100 died in the horrific accident. And a November 2012 apparel factory fire on Dhaka's outskirts killed at least 117 people, some of whom jumped from the building to escape the flames. Most of the dead were women, almost half of them burned so badly that DNA tests were needed to identify them. That blaze led to the convictions of 13 people for gross negligence of safety measures and spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers' rights in Bangladesh. The government responded by revamping laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions, and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5% of their profits toward a workers' welfare fund. The government also boosted minimum wages from $38 to around $68 per month. Yet this hasn't stopped more deadly incidents, including the January deaths of at least 13 people when a fire broke out inside a Dhaka factory. Farid Ahmed reported from Dhaka and Harmeet Shah Singh from New Delhi. Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

"(CNN)There are many things that immigrants could teach those of us who are U.S.-born. The biggest lesson may simply to be grateful for our rights and privileges. That includes the little things we take for granted. Like a small plastic card that not only allows us to drive on public roadways but also provides us a sense of identity. Imagine not having a driver's license and not being able to obtain one because the government prohibits it. Erika Andiola doesn't have to imagine. Until recently, the 27-year-old Phoenix resident and co-director of the Arizona Dream Coalition was barred from having a driver's license by Arizona. The reason: she is an undocumented immigrant born in Mexico and brought here as a child by her mother. Given that she arrived in the United States when she was 11 and has lived on this side of the U.S.-Mexico border longer than she lived on the other side, Andiola considers herself an American and this country her home. Under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which was initiated by the Obama administration, more than half a million undocumented youth were given a two-year reprieve from deportation and a work permit. Andiola is one of the recipients, having been granted DACA protection in November 2012 and a renewal since then. From that point, had she lived in another state, the process for getting a driver's license might have been much smoother. But she lives in Arizona, which -- in the 20 years from 1989 to 2009 -- welcomed illegal immigrants and their labor to build homes in Phoenix, work in restaurants in Tucson and make beds at ski lodges in Flagstaff but then tried to expel them when their chores were done. To push them out the door, legislators passed a spiteful law in 2010 that roped local police into enforcing federal immigration statutes and essentially sanctioned ethnic profiling of Latinos. In August 2012, on the same day that DACA took effect, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer issued an executive order preventing the program's recipients from obtaining driver's licenses or other public ""benefit."" Brewer's order was challenged in court. Two years later, in July 2014, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Arizona policy as a violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. With that, the estimated 22,000 DACA recipients who are also residents of the Grand Canyon State were free to apply for driver's licenses and take their driving tests like anyone else. Andiola got her Arizona license earlier this month, after paying a $25 fee that she'll have to pay every two years each time she renews it. I wondered what traveling that road taught her about that piece of plastic she carries with her. And I was curious about whether she had given any thought to how the native-born see driver's licenses compared to people like her. ""There is a pretty big difference,"" Andiola said. ""I think it's because we fought really hard for it. People born here might not ever think about their driver's license unless they buy a drink or get stopped by police. For us, it's a reminder of the fruits of our labor. Think about how many minds we had to change so people could come out of the shadows."" Other privileges get taken for granted by the native-born, she said, such as the ability to apply for financial aid to attend college or pay the lower in-state tuition that you're entitled to pay as a state resident. ""When it comes to higher education, I don't think a lot of people really understand what they have unless they have to struggle to get it,"" Andiola said. ""I have nephews who are citizens. I'm trying to make them understand how it was such a big deal, in my case, to attend college and pay in-state tuition and have it taken away. It was a big hurdle, and I almost dropped out. I want them to understand some of the privileges they have."" Finally, there's the right to vote. Undocumented immigrants can't do it, and yet many of those U.S. citizens who can don't bother going to the polls. ""Look at what we've done to bring change,"" she said. ""Imagine how much someone can accomplish when they vote. A lot of Americans don't learn the political process. And you don't feel you need to until you struggle to drive, to vote, to just be allowed to stay with your family."" Listen to her, America. This is an exemplary country, and it'll stay that way as long as those of us who were born here and have these rights and privileges learn to appreciate them, treat them with care and put them to good use.","Ruben Navarrette: A driver's license is not only about transportation but about identity .

"(CNN)Embattled Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned Wednesday, a week after a scathing Justice Department report slammed his department. Jackson and the city ""have agreed to a mutual separation,"" Ferguson officials announced. ""It's a really hard pill to swallow,"" Jackson said in a text message responding to CNN's request for comment. He also confirmed his resignation in a letter to Ferguson's mayor. ""It is with profound sadness that I am announcing I am stepping down from my position as chief of police for the city of Ferguson, Missouri,"" Jackson said, adding that serving the city as police chief ""has been an honor and a privilege."" The resignation will go into effect March 19, Jackson said, to ""provide for an orderly transition of command."" ""I will continue to assist the city in any way I can in my capacity as private citizen,"" Jackson wrote. But even though he's about to be out of a job, Jackson will still collect a paycheck. Jackson will receive a severance payment and health insurance for one year, the city said, with Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff assuming his duties during a nationwide search for a new chief. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said he couldn't go into details about the personnel discussions behind the decision to give Jackson a year of severance pay. ""I think it's fair to say that in many executive level private industries, you would get a similar treatment,"" he said. Knowles said the police chief decided to resign ""after a lot of soul searching."" ""I think it's important that we recognize that the chief made this decision because he wanted to do this,"" Knowles said. ""He thought it was the best for the city and the Police Department."" Hours after the announcement, protesters gathered outside the Ferguson Police Department. ""Fight back,"" many chanted as they faced a long line of police officers. At least two people were arrested, CNN affiliate KMOV said, but it was not immediately clear why. As of late Wednesday night, the protest was largely peaceful. Jackson's resignation is the latest fallout from the Justice Department report, which exposed problems in the city's policing tactics and faulted Ferguson's officers for seeing residents as ""sources of revenue,"" a practice that federal investigators said disproportionately targeted African-Americans. The investigators also found evidence of racist jokes being sent around by Ferguson police and court officials. Ferguson City Manager John Shaw stepped down Tuesday. The report mentions both men by name. Two police officers resigned last week and the city's top court clerk was fired in connection with racist emails, city spokesman Jeff Small said on Friday. Last week, Jackson declined to comment on details in the report. ""I need to have time to really analyze this report so I can comment on it,"" Jackson told CNN Thursday. When asked what he planned to do about the report's findings, the chief said he would ""take action as necessary."" After his resignation Wednesday, he said in a written statement to CNN's Don Lemon that he was encouraged by the report's conclusion, which says that Ferguson ""has the capacity to reform its approach to law enforcement."" ""We agree that Ferguson can do the tough work to see this through and emerge the best small town it can be,"" he said. Knowles told reporters Wednesday that the city is still analyzing the report. ""We continue to go through that report and talk about where the breakdown was,"" he said. ""The chief, being an honorable man, decided we needed to talk about the way moving forward was with someone else. He left."" City officials, he said, still believe the Police Department can be reformed without being eliminated. ""The city of Ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity,"" the mayor said. ""We are committed to keeping our Police Department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness."" When Jackson became Ferguson's police chief in 2010, it was supposed to be a relatively easy way to cap his career in law enforcement. After some 30 years with the St. Louis County Police Department, serving as commander of a drug task force and SWAT team supervisor, being a police chief of a smaller department should have been less stressful. The shooting of Michael Brown last year changed everything. Brown, an African-American teen, was unarmed when he was shot by a white Ferguson police officer. The incident exposed feelings of distrust between Ferguson's black community and its police department,  which is overwhelmingly white. Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, won't face any criminal charges for the shooting. In November, a grand jury decided not to indict him. Last week the Justice Department said Wilson's actions ""do not constitute prosecutable violations"" of federal civil rights law. He resigned from the department in November, citing security concerns. But that hasn't stopped criticism of the department from local residents and top federal officials. Even before the Justice Department report was finished, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said it was ""pretty clear that the need for wholesale change in that department is appropriate."" Critics have accused Jackson of inflaming tensions in the St. Louis suburb with his response to the shooting. Over the past six months, Jackson has defended his officers and vowed to work with the community. ""I intend to see this thing through. And I've been working with a lot of community members to work on some progressive changes that will bring the community together and to open up dialogue and getting us all talking about serious issues and actually creating solutions to problems,"" he told CNN in November. CNN's Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","Protesters gather outside the Ferguson Police Department, chanting ""Fight back""

"Islamabad (CNN)Pakistan has ordered a stay of execution of a man who was convicted of manslaughter while he was 14 years old. Shafqat Hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but a government official confirmed Wednesday night with a tweet that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours. ""We are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours,"" said Shahab Siddiqui, Hussain's lawyer. ""We will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need."" Hussain's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners, who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police. His family says Hussain, at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004. Unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer, whom, according to human rights groups, failed to provide any evidence or claim that Hussain was a juvenile. This meant Hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court. A social media campaign with the hashtag #SaveShafqat trended in Pakistan and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case. Shafqat was calm when he thought he was going to be executed, Manzoor Hussain, his brother told CNN. ""He had said that if I don't get justice in this world, I will get it in my afterlife."" ""I can't tell you what kind of night my family has had. I close my eyes and I want to forget. I can't express the agony we have gone through, waiting and not knowing."" Hussain was initially due to be hanged on January 19, but under international pressure, Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order. Addressing parliament, the minister called for an investigation into the young man's age. Two months later, another death warrant was issued for Hussain, with an execution date set for March 19. Since then Hussain's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest. Attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by Pakistan that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts. Pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar, which left at least 145 teachers and students dead. It was the deadliest act of terror in the country's history. The decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row, the largest number in the world. The lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in Pakistan and abroad. ""It's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves,"" Zohra Yusuf, the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told CNN. ""Executions on this scale tend to brutalize society."" Earlier this week the European Union released a statement on its website calling Pakistan to ""reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations, in particular the principle of fair trial."" The statement also said that Pakistan is a party to an international covenant ""that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age.""​ .","Pakistan postpones inmate's execution for the second time .

"(CNN)Nigerians go to the polls on March 28 in a tight contest, which is getting extra attention after the original date was rescheduled at the last minute. Many voters will be holding their registration card in one hand, and their mobile in the other -- making democratic history with the help of tech. In Africa's largest mobile phone market, programs to encourage citizens to get involved in the election have been gaining traction. ""Nigerians are looking for information,"" says Femi Longe, co-founder of Co-Creation Hub which meshes tech and social issues. ""Technology is helping people get involved in the conversation around democracy and elections, which is very important, as the general interest in the air has waned since the voting date was changed."" As incumbent Goodluck Jonathan prepares to face-off against former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, Longe and his team have developed TechSQUAD -- a gang of geeks who work on web-projects that help citizens vote. Pre-Vote Prep . One such project is Govote.ng, a popular website that is focused on the registration process -- that's crucial as in Africa's most populous country, with over 170 million citizens, the logistics can be staggering. ""Most Nigerians have no idea where they are registered,"" explains Longe. ""We want to simplify the entire election process, [and] make it responsive to users."" People log on to the site to see whether they are registered with the Nigeria Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and, if not, they can find out how and where to register. TechSQUAD says approximately 10,000 people visit the site each day. Finger's Influence . Other squads concentrate on the next step. Youth charity YIAGA has set up ThumbPower which gets Nigerians to ""use your thumb wisely."" Sections like ""Who can vote"" and ""Where and When"" set out the process in language anyone can understand. Interactive maps connect users to local activists and the countdown clock is a reminder that the new elections date is approaching fast. ""The rescheduling of the election ... did affect the level of voter enthusiasm,"" explains YIAGA Program Manager, Cynthia Mbamalu. ""While there are certain concerns about security and the guarantee of free, fair and credible elections, the interest in this election is founded on the belief that this time votes will count."" Personality Problem . This election will be the first since Nigeria re-calculated it's GDP and pulled ahead of South Africa to become the continent's biggest economy. With a nominal GDP of $510 billion, and an oil sector that makes up 96% of total export earnings, the outcome of the vote will be closely watched by policy makers and businesses all over the world. Politicians, however, stand accused of relying on personalities rather than policies when it comes to winning votes. ""The strength of a leader's personality and his key personal networks are playing a very strong role,"" says Jasper Veen, Nigeria Director at National Democratic Institute. ""Both flag-bearers occasionally attempt to articulate policy positions -- it is still a far cry from policy-based politics."" And this is set to be a particular issue in this poll, as some seek a strongman who can defeat Boko Haram militants in the North-East -- the main justification authorities used when explaining the decision to delay the vote by six weeks. To fight this popularity contest, TechSQUAD collaborated with The Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) to produce ngmanifesto.org, which explains what the parties plan to do to improve education, the economy and infrastructure. And once a government is elected, the site will track whether election pledges become reality. 'Quick Count' Technology will also play a big role on voting day. A representative volunteer network of 4,000 observers trained by Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) will corroborate official election results using a system of text messages. The SMSs are coded so they cannot be intercepted, and also to ensure the data can be organized and communicated quickly. The process aims to bring transparency to the elections, and will be assisted by Niger's Former Prime Minister, Mahamadou Danda, who is part of a smaller team of international observers organized by the National Democratic Institute. Such independent observation is likely to speak to the thousands of citizens concerned with governance in the country. A recent Afrobarometer poll found that 68% of respondents are ""not very"" or ""not at all"" satisfied with the way democracy is working in Nigeria. Another approach to inspire citizens to get involved in the election is the Nigerian Constitution App which has been downloaded almost 1 million times according to The Indigo Trust. By making the constitution available on mobile phones, the app aims to teach citizens about national laws and inspire them to vote. And there's also BudgIT -- a site that publishes state and federal budgets for all to see. The list of election-based websites and apps goes on -- too many to mention here. But, while the election outcome is yet to be seen, it seems that the tech involved could bring a formidable force to the ballot box. More from Marketplace Africa .

"(CNN)Through his work in fashion, Erik Schnakenberg was drawn to the classic Americana style that has seen a revival in the past decade. He was turned off by the price tag of American-made clothing: basic crew-neck tees starting at $50, unembellished selvedge denim jeans priced at $250 and up, Oxford cloth button-downs cut and sewn in Los Angeles ranging from $150 to $300. ""It's that effortless design that most guys look good wearing, but it wasn't really happening for anyone except at the higher price point,"" Schnakenberg said. To help shrink the gap, Schnakenberg and his Los Angeles neighbor, Sasha Koehn, started a business with a goal of lowering the barrier to ""made in USA"" fashion. Buck Mason has been up and running since late 2013, offering a focused collection of American-made garments. Prices range from $24 for a t-shirt to $155 for its most expensive pair of jeans, about 25% to 50% less than comparable brands boasting the ""made in USA"" label. How do they keep costs down? By focusing on just a few items and cutting out the middleman so they can sell directly to customers through their website and storefront in Venice, California, they say. With the help of the Internet and social media, they have been able to build their brand and find an audience without the help of chains or department stores. ""It didn't make sense for us to not do it this way,"" Koehn said. ""Maybe that's us being naive or not thinking like a traditional business manager, but I don't see how we could have got this started any other way."" Brands selling directly to customers is nothing new in retail, and it's still a big gamble for most. Traditional middlemen such as department stores, chains and boutiques help legitimize brands and expose them to consumers faster than brands may be able to build their own fan bases. But some small businesses are finding the cost of that exposure too onerous. By selling directly to consumers, brands increase their margins, control inventory based on their own projections and don't have to worry about returns from retail store customers. They also have complete control over pricing and may be able to offer lower prices to consumers, said Jack W. Plunkett, CEO of market research company Plunkett Research. Fueled by venture capital investors, there has been strong growth in new direct to consumer brands, and not only in clothing, Plunkett said. But very few actually manufacture in the United States because of the high cost of doing business, especially compared with global competitors. For Buck Mason, manufacturing in the United States is a matter of principle and direct to consumer a means to that end, Schnakenberg said. ""It's that idea of looking at our product and taking pride in creating something from scratch. We may not sell 100 million t-shirts, but we can say we're to create one thing and make it all here and be part of the process,"" Schnakenberg said. To make direct to consumer work, Buck Mason and other plucky entrepreneurs are mixing aspects of traditional business models with customized approaches to production and marketing, taking on much of the work typically done by outside parties. They sell through their own websites and stores, retaining absolute control over branding and merchandising. They build audiences through social media, using it as a branding tool and a forum to seek customer feedback on styles and colors, forming relationships in the process. But it takes more populating a Web store or Instagram feed with aspirational images of attractive people to reduce margins. Brands offering specialty products that stand out have a better chance of surviving, depending on the product and its place in the global market, Plunkett said. ""Overall, this is positive for the sustainability of U.S. manufacturing, but there are many cases in which it will be extremely difficult to have competitive prices when manufacturing here,"" he said. Instead of designing various products in different colors and styles, fledgling brands have found success in getting just a few items right, developing a cult-like following and adding products based on customer feedback. It's a model that has worked for Adele Berne and Mike Kuhle, who launched the e-commerce arm of their New York storefront, Epaulet, in 2008 with a button-down shirt for men and women made in the city. From day one, they have sold directly to consumers through their website and store, using social media to build a fan base that enjoys geeking out as much as they do over fabric origins and stitching details. Since then, they have expanded to accessories and footwear, and they offer custom suiting and shirts. Along the way, they have earned a reputation for offering quality products sourced and made in the United States and Europe. They partner with esteemed brands including shoemaker Alden and suit maker Southwick on products and offer a handful of other brands for sale. Through social media, Kuhle says, Epaulet has cultivated a fan base interested in the stories behind the brand, its creators and its manufacturing partners. Their customers see the value in paying more for products made in the U.S. or Europe, and they keep coming back. ""Your product has to be unique, and it has to be something people want, whether it's filling a void for something people don't know they want yet, or it's something you see in market that you could do better,"" Berne said. Buck Mason launched with a simple T-shirt, working with a knitter in Los Angeles to develop a slub cotton before sending it to a mill outside the city. When it sold out, the company started working on a five-pocket selvedge denim jean sourced from North Carolina and cut and sewn in Los Angeles. It's an a la carte approach to production that takes more time and attention than the full-package manufacturing typically used by larger brands to fill big orders under one roof. The upside is that it keeps shipping costs down and allows Buck Mason to respond faster to market demands by placing small orders with a quick turnaround. Chris Sutton started out making one pair of jeans at a time in his Cincinnati, Ohio, workshop. As demand for Noble Denim grew, Sutton and his wife, Abby, scaled up production by partnering with a Tennessee factory that, like most remaining textile manufacturers, had seen better days. As the Suttons learned more about the factory's history and the town it once supported, they realized it needed more business to create sustainable employment opportunities. It was ""hipster and naive"" of them to think they could make a significant impact with small runs of premium jeans, Abby Sutton said, and they started pondering new products. They tested the waters with a small run of sweatshirts. After selling out within days, the couple decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a new business. Sweatshirts sold under the Victor label will be made from organic cotton in the same factory as Noble Denim. Unlike Noble, which is sold in a few stores, Victor will be sold directly to consumers through the company's website and its brick and mortar store in Cincinnati. Cutting out the middleman allows Noble to control its brand instead of relinquishing control to wholesalers and create ""stability"" in terms of sales expectations, Abby Sutton said. ""Everyone is oddly reliant on each other but not in way that encourages innovation."" It also creates a quicker ""feedback loop"" through which the Suttons can listen and respond to customer feedback. That's how they heard from people who said they could not afford to support the ""made in USA"" movement even though they wanted to. Through Victor, whose products range from $25 for a tee to $85 for a hooded sweatshirt, the Suttons hope to rehab American-made style's reputation as exclusively high-end and inaccessible, she said. ""There are people who value the idea of U.S.-made but have never taken the step,"" she said. ""If we can make it for the same price as a Gap sweatshirt, hopefully people will see it as easy choice.""","American-made clothing brands try to cut out middleman, selling directly to consumers .

"(CNN)Eight American aid workers who were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone have been flown back to the United States where health authorities will watch them closely for signs of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Three more exposed workers are due to arrive back in the United States on Monday. The returning workers are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. None of them is showing symptoms of Ebola, but all had contact with a colleague who's been diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. While in West Africa, the workers ""came to the aid of their ailing colleague,"" according to a Partners in Health statement. As the CDC investigates who else might have had contact with the Ebola patient, more workers might be flown back to the United States, according to Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC. The workers are being housed near hospitals that specialize in treating Ebola patients, and if they show signs of the disease, they'll be admitted as patients. Nurse who contracted Ebola sues hospital company . Four of the clinicians arrived Saturday to housing on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, according to spokesman Taylor Wilson. The workers have voluntarily agreed not to leave their housing. ""They will be monitored so they'll stay there,"" Wilson said. Another aid worker was flown to Atlanta over the weekend and is being housed near Emory University Hospital, and three more workers are scheduled to arrive in Atlanta on Monday, according to Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health. As in Nebraska, the workers in Georgia must stay in their housing for 21 days after the date of their exposure to Ebola. ""Twice a day, we'll have visual monitoring either face to face or we'll Skype with them, or do FaceTime,"" Nydam said. ""And if it's Skype or FaceTIme, they'll have to be in a place where we can clearly identify that they are where they're supposed to be."" Three more exposed workers arrived Saturday at the National Institute of Health in Maryland. These workers ""will remain restricted from public places"" and have ""limited movement, including no mass transportation,"" according to a statement from Christopher Garrett, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health. The heath care worker with Ebola was in serious condition Friday, the NIH said. Details about the patient's identity weren't released. The patient is the second with Ebola admitted to the NIH hospital. Nina Pham, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, was admitted to NIH in October after she contracted the disease while treating Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan. Pham recovered and was released free of disease. Duncan died. Emory, the NIH and Nebraska are three of only four hospitals in the United States that have biocontainment units to deal with a highly infectious disease such as Ebola. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates back to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all of the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. CNN's Carma Hassan, Joe Sutton and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Eight have already returned and three more are due Monday .

"Washington (CNN)It doesn't matter how many times Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now says he still wants a two-state solution with the Palestinians. The White House is refusing to take him at his word. ""We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region,"" President Barack Obama said in an interview with The Huffington Post published Saturday. These are the President's first public comments since Netanyahu's party captured the most seats in Tuesday's parliamentary election. Netanyahu has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in Palestinian statehood, despite his pre-election flip-flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes. Only on Thursday, two days after the election, did President Obama congratulate Netanyahu by phone on his victory. White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to say whether Netanyahu clarified his position on the two-state policy during that phone call. But Obama told the Prime Minister that the United States would ""reassess"" aspects of its relationship with Israel after Netanyahu's earlier provocative statements opposing the creation of a Palestinian state. Administration officials have said the United States is now considering signing on to a U.N. resolution which supports a Palestinian state. Regarding comments Netanyahu made Tuesday about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls ""in droves"" -- comments described by some as racist -- Obama told The Huffington Post that that kind of ""rhetoric"" was ""contrary to what is best of Israel's traditions. That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly."" Obama added: ""If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the name of democracy in the country."" U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, who invited Netanyahu to address that controversial joint meeting of Congress earlier this month, plans to visit Israel at the end of the month. While the speaker's office says the trip was planned well before the Prime Minister's re-election, it will come around the deadline for an initial nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and other world powers.","President talks with Huffington Post about Israeli leader .

"(CNN)Andrew Paul Tahmooressi, the Marine reservist who made international headlines during his seven-month imprisonment in Mexico, has been released from a Georgia jail, where he was held Wednesday night. Tahmooressi was arrested in Twin City, Georgia, on Wednesday for ""driving under the influence, reckless driving, improper passing and an open container violation,"" according to a statement from Emanuel County Sheriff J. Tyson Stephens. A spokesman for the family confirmed Tahmooressi's release, saying his client, ""is very appreciative of the professionalism of the involved Sheriff's Department during the course of his custody."" Jonathan Franks said Tahmooressi ""continues to struggle with PTSD"" and that this incident must be seen in that context. Tahmooressi made news around the world after his arrest on March 31, 2014, at a Tijuana, Mexico, checkpoint. Mexican customs agents found three firearms in his truck, including a .45-caliber pistol, a pump shotgun and an AR-15 rifle. The country's strict federal gun laws prohibit anyone from illegally bringing weapons into the country. Tahmooressi maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border into Tijuana and accidentally crossed the border. In November, after 214 days, he was freed. A Mexican court said it found no cause to prosecute Tahmooressi on charges of carrying two firearms used exclusively by the military, possessing cartridges used exclusively by the military and carrying a firearm without a license .

"(CNN)Superheroes have always had a special place in my heart. I grew up in Zambia in the 1980s, an era that marked the beginning of the country's worst economic crisis. My childhood memories are of a prolonged state of emergency that was characterized by acute food shortages and an economic decline where the basic needs of the average Zambian family were barely met. My siblings and I -- and our gang of friends from around the farmlands -- spent countless hours sitting on a deserted piggery wall, perfecting our extra-terrestrial code language. Our goal was to send an SOS out to the superheroes in the galaxies, and had our code language been refined enough to reach across the chasm of space, perhaps a spaceship would come down to Earth to save us from our dreary lives and carry us away into outer space. Searching for superheroes . Rewind to just a few years earlier -- in the mid to late 1970s and before the economic decline -- when superheroes like Superman, Spiderman, Batman and the Incredible Hulk were huge deals for anyone growing up. In our childhood eyes, these were powerful, all-embodying beings, and their brands were merchandised on T-shirts, caps, lunchboxes, toys, and just about everything. They influenced many aspects of the childhood experience to such an extent that I spent a lot of my formative years aspiring to become a superhero when I grew up. But then disillusionment set in. It dawned on me that I would never be a superhero seeing as most of them were male -- and all of them white. The frantic search for an alternative and relatable superhero that followed only resulted in more disillusionment. So many years later, in the year 2015, it is somewhat bewildering to experience today the same disillusionment when I see so little representation of cultural minorities in popular media. This is a big deal to me. I am of that school of thought that believes that radio, television, film and other media of popular culture provide the symbols, myths and resources through which we constitute a common culture. Meet Ananiya . The danger of excluding cultural minorities from popular media is that this limited view starts to paint a constrained picture of what a person should look like, how they should behave and live to the negation of alternative experiences of being human. These deliberations are the basis for my graphic novel, ""The Revolutionist."" A work in progress, ""The Revolutionist"" is set in the near future, on a satellite colony that is located a little off the orbit of mainland Earth, and administrated by a corporation. Social conformity in the interest of the collective is subliminally reinforced through symbolism and iconology, while the economy is purely corporate-driven. Exploitation of human by human, and robot by human gives rise to the resistance. Ananiya was only 13 years old when she joined the resistance. Now at 17, she has recently been appointed as an agent in the Covert Operations Division. In the ensuing standoff where the Corporation increasingly maintains control with an ironclad fist it is not long before the resistance galvanizes into a full-blown revolution. As the masses are thrust into a state of emergency, Ananiya's world is characterized by curfews, police raids, censorship and propaganda. Will the revolution overcome? With this literary and visual offering, I describe a world that is both like -- and at the same time very much unlike -- our own. As a young, black female, my protagonist, Ananiya, is the most unlikely hero for the revolution. It would, indeed, be accurate to read her as the antithesis of the typical hero who more often than not is male, white, straight and privileged. Hey, maybe someday the nine-year old version of me can grow up to become a superhero after all. See Milumbe Haimbe's work here . Read this: Modern African art in the spotlight .

"New Delhi, India (CNN)A passenger train overshot a stop and jumped its tracks in northern India on Friday, killing at least 30 people and injuring more than 50 others, a railway spokesman said. The train was headed from Dehradun to the Hindu holy city of Varanasi when it overshot an intended stop more than halfway along the route, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of Lucknow in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, railway spokesman Neeraj Sharma said. Two coaches and the locomotive derailed. Video from the site, shown by CNN affiliate IBN, showed emergency workers pulling passengers from the train as a crowd looked on. The cause of the incident will be investigated, Sharma said. CNN's Harmeet Singh reported from New Delhi.

"(CNN)Former male model Elo used to make a living from his good looks. But after modeling for 10 years the self-confessed car nut had earned enough money to indulge his passion. He started by buying several cars, as well as customizing them for clients across the world, and in 2001 he founded the London Motor Museum. Today is has nearly 250 automobiles. ""When I was modeling, the best part of my modeling career was (that) I was expressing what my client wanted me to do,"" he says. ""I still express what (clients) want me to express, but this time in a three-dimensional form with an engine and an exhaust and some wheels. And that is ultimate satisfaction."" During his fashion model days, Elo owned seven cars and would drive a different one each day of the week. What started as a passion gradually demanded more and more of his time, and after a while Elo felt that he came to a crossroads. ""I had to weigh between continuing modeling or stopping modeling to just do cars. So I chose the latter,"" he says. ""My friends told me 'You're absolutely crazy, look at all these beautiful women, look at all this traveling around the world.' And I'm like 'Are you out of your mind? Look at that beautiful steel!' That's the best."" Today, the car-lover's  collection includes gems such as the 1937 Lincoln Zephyr, and a low-riding customized Cadillac which used to belong to Snoop Dogg -- the so-called ""Snoop de Ville"". But what gives Elo the most satisfaction is something less material: the feeling of freedom. ""When I drive a car, I feel like I am leaving all my worries behind, and it's just staying behind whilst I'm going forward,"" he says.","Elo used to be a successful male model .

"(CNN)Let's just say -- hypothetically -- you found yourself in possession of Ecstasy while in Ireland on Tuesday. No worries. Everything was cool, because it wasn't illegal Tuesday. Wednesday could be a different story. An appeals court ruling invalidating one section of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 made the controlled substances it had regulated legal for at least one day. The Independent newspaper of the United Kingdom said Ecstasy, ketamine and magic mushrooms were three of the temporarily legal drugs. The Court of Appeal ruled those drugs and others had unconstitutionally been added to Section 2 of the law. ""We prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet,"" Minister for Health Leo Varadkar said in a written statement. The government had to get the new legislation through parliament so the drugs added to the law since 1977 could be considered illegal again. It should happen within 24 hours, the Department of Health said Tuesday. Drugs such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin remained illegal as did the sale of ""psychoactive substances."" The Independent said past convictions for some drug offenses will be called into question but The Journal of Ireland said the court's decision will impact only cases currently in the judicial process.","Court of appeals rules certain parts of drug law are unconstitutional .

"(CNN)For Max, the passage of Indiana's new religious freedom law feels a lot like high school. Max is transgender. The 26-year-old was born a female but identifies as a man. That was a tough experience in Evansville: looking like a girl, everyone treating you like one, but not feeling at home in your skin. Classmates made fun of him. He withdrew. He and his parents fought. Now they don't talk. Making it to his mid-20s feels like a victory to him now, as does knowing that he has friends who support him, friends who are straight and gay and transgender. He had just gotten to a point of feeling accepted when the Indiana state legislature passed the Religious Freedom Act. ""This law makes me feel like I'm being bullied all over again,"" he said. ""If I go into a restaurant and the owner doesn't like me because I'm transgender, because their religion has told them that I'm bad, does that give them the right to refuse to serve me? Proponents of the law, including Gov. Mike Pence, say that's not what the law will do. He has said it's intended to prevent the government from forcing anyone to do something that opposes their religious beliefs. Some businesses and Indianans are behind him. Nationally influential Christian evangelist Franklin Graham, who lives in North Carolina, tweeted this week, ""Thank God for politicians like @GovPenceIN who are not afraid to take a stand regardless of political consequences."" But there is a tidal wave of opposition throughout the state and across the country. Critics say the law is a thinly veiled mechanism to legally sanction discrimination. Protests have raged throughout the state and elsewhere. Some religious leaders oppose it. Civic groups, corporations and state governments, such as Washington state and Connecticut, are vowing not to to do business with Indiana. The Indiana Chamber of Commerce has blasted the law. So has the N.C.A.A. Its college basketball tournament is hosting the Final Four in Indianapolis this weekend. Some businesses in the state are reacting by placing signs in windows that read, ""We serve everyone."" Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a vocal opponent of the law, demanded: ""Fix this law. ... Do so immediately."" He and others contend that because Indiana, unlike other states, has no statewide law protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination, this religious freedom law is a license to discriminate. Hundreds of protesters joined Max in a demonstration on the streets of Evansville Monday. Some said they would consider leaving the state because the law makes them feel unwelcome. Lee Flowers, 27, organized a rally in Evansville to protest the law. He grew up in Indiana, but now he's afraid to go into businesses with his boyfriend. ""This is very personal,"" he said. ""It hurts me. It really does. This is shameful for Indiana. Is anyone infringing on someone's religion? No. This is about giving people the legal defense to refuse business to someone they don't like based on sexual orientation."" Casey Samson of Samson Family Leather in Lebanon told CNN that he read the law, which runs four pages. He feels that the law merely protects his right to refuse to sell to a customer whose beliefs he thinks offend his Catholic faith. That doesn't include gay customers, he insists. ""We have no issues serving a same sex couple at all,"" he said. ""The law is strictly protecting people from the government to forcefully make them do something against their will."" CNN asked him to give an example of what might offend him, and cause him to refuse to sell to someone. ""Anything that promotes hate or a derogatory statement that someone believes is OK,"" he answered. ""I don't want to take my personal time making a product that spews hate into the world."" That's never happened in Samson Family Leather's 35-year history, he said, but it could and that's why he thinks the law is needed. The owner has shared his opinion with local media, and that has sparked a fierce backlash from many in the community, he said. ""We've been called homophobic and hypocrites,"" he said. ""We've also experienced a very large amount of support.""Our phones have not stopped ringing from people all over the state and country. We've gotten e-mails saying 'I appreciate you standing up. Thank you for standing up for our rights.' "" Indiana pastor Mike Woods told CNN Monday that he supports the law, too. ""As someone who walks in my religious freedom all the time, I'm glad I have something to protect me,"" he said. ""I don't see the law as discriminatory. I just see it protecting people from any type of business or anyone trying to infringe on their religious rights."" Woods blamed Pence's office for its ""inability to educate"" people about what the law says. There should have been public meetings about it, Woods said. The Indianapolis Star reported that the ceremony where Pence signed the bill into law on Thursday was ""deliberately low-key and private"" and closed to media. The governor's staff office, it said, refused to provide names of people who surrounded Pence as he signed. To Samson, the law doesn't explicitly use the word discrimination and that, to him, means it won't lead to discrimination. The law states that the government can't ""substantially burden a person's exercise of religion"" and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be ""substantially burdened"" can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits. An often used example: A florist who doesn't want to sell flowers to a gay couple or a baker who doesn't want to make their wedding cake. Those are arguably businesses that can choose which client to hire and which to reject, proponents of the law say. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it's likely that a refusal to serve a gay person wouldn't stand under the law, but a refusal to provide a service for a gay wedding would. ""Indiana isn't the first state to establish this law,"" Samson said. ""It's nothing new for the U.S. and the state of Indiana."" Samson is right that Indiana isn't the first state to adopt a religious freedom law, but the situation is a little more complicated than that. Indiana is the 20th state to adopt a ""religious freedom restoration"" law. For instance, bills in Arizona, Georgia and Ohio with similar wording were proposed. The effort in Arizona failed in 2014. Georgia's bill has not been voted on and the legislative session ends Thursday. The Ohio bill stalled in 2014. A similar bill is proposed in Arkansas. In Little Rock Monday night, protesters demonstrated against a bill called the Conscious Protection Act. As the bill's creator, Republican Rep. Bob Ballinger left a meeting Monday, protesters shouted: ""Shame on you!"" In the past, religious freedom laws were enacted with broad support. Many were passed before the recent movement for gay rights and before the majority of states came to recognize same-sex marriage. But when it was introduced in December, the bill that became Indian's religious freedom law incited fierce debate among faith leaders, businesses and residents, the Indianapolis Star newspaper reports. Mark Ivy watched as that debate raged over the holidays and into the new year, hoping that the bill would not pass. He lives in Farmersburg, Indiana, where about 1,100 people live. Indiana recognized gay marriage last October. Ivy married his longtime partner in December. ""I understand politics in Indiana. I know it's conservative. I get that this is about politics,"" he said. ""Because I can see it as politics, I'm not mad."" But he also said that he feels the law is ""about bigotry, plain and simple."" ""It's taking us back decades, removing so much progress toward equality in Indiana,"" he said. Ivy worries that the law could not only allow discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. He wonders if it ""could conceivably be used for Jewish businesses to  refuse service to Muslims and Christians. Hindus could bar Bhuddists.  Protestants and Catholics could shun each other,"" Ivy wrote in a CNN iReport. ""Mainline church members  could say, 'No' to evangelicals."" On social media, debate over the law showed no signs of letting up. In response to Christian leader Graham's tweet supporting the law, someone with the username Mary M tweeted, ""amen using his God given right."" Jennifer Watson tweeted them back: ""NO: as an elected official, his rights are not God given, they are voter given."" CNN's Rosa Flores, Justin Lear, Sonia Moghe, Jeremy Diamond and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Transgender 20-something says Indiana's new feels like legalized discrimination .

"(CNN)An Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant, according to Dallas police. Authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where Ahmed Al-Jumaili lived -- and died -- in their effort to find out who killed the 36-year-old early Thursday, as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow. Al-Jumaili's wife was with them taking photos. Dallas police spokesman Jeff Cotner said Al-Jumaili, who recently immigrated to the U.S., had never seen snow and ""just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us."" There is ""extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago,"" said Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. CAIR became involved in the case immediately after the shooting, according to Salem, because of ""a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims."" Salem said the Muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether  Al-Jumaili was targeted. Police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime. When shooting broke out, Al-Jumaili cried ""I'm hit!"" according to Cotner, basing that on statements from witnesses and the victim's relatives. He ran to his apartment nearby and died a few hours later. Police did not say where Al-Jumaili was struck or how many times he was shot. Some residents reported seeing two to four men enter the apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate before the shooting, according to Cotner. He said there was no interaction between the men and Al-Jumaili and his family. In black-and-white soundless surveillance video, one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. The second person is shown walking at a slower pace, holding what appears to be a handgun in his right hand. Approximately 13 seconds later, another person comes into view and passes by the camera, followed by a fourth individual who is walking, she said. From the vantage point of the camera, it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender, although police have said they are looking for four black males. Witnesses say multiple shots were fired from what is believed to be a rifle. Cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting, but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon. Cotner said Friday that other than that, police have little to go on. ""We can't solve this crime alone,"" he said. Authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment, police said. Salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it. She said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family's expenses, as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","Dallas police say Ahmed Al-Jumaili was killed by shot from a rifle, but they aren't revealing what type .

"(CNN)His satire took Egypt, and the world, by storm. But now, Bassem Youssef -- Egypt's most famous satirist known as his country's Jon Stewart -- has the public profile of a politician in retirement, leading study groups at the Harvard Kennedy School. ""Well, you know, sometimes circumstances are not the best for you to continue a political satire show,"" Youssef told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that aired Monday. ""Sometimes jokes kind of are annoying."" His show -- literally called ""The Show,"" or ""Al Bernameg"" -- ran for three seasons during Egypt's turbulent and utterly confusing post-Arab Spring days. Youssef's biting satire left nothing unscathed -- whether the president, political and militant Islam, or the military. ""There is room for satire and comedy as long as it's acceptable by the people controlling the atmosphere."" His incredible story from cardiac surgeon to satirist to political target is the subject of a documentary currently in production, directed by a senior producer for Stewart, with whom Youssef developed a close relationship. ""It's talking about political satire, humor, how (people can) be all for a certain program or a joke, but when the joke turns on them, they kind of like turn on you,"" he said. ""And so maybe we were an equal opportunity satirist, but they were not (an) equal opportunity audience."" The chances are small that his show would be allowed back on air, if he even wanted to do so -- ""The question is will I be allowed to do, make fun of whatever (I want)?"" (""Who said that my country's authoritarian? Come on,"" he joked. ""I mean, don't put words in my mouth. We are -- it's a very, very good, democratic country; please, please."") But he is far from idle, seemingly casting around for ways to occupy his immense talent. At Harvard, he is a visiting fellow working on ""political satire and humor, and how they interact with political, social and even religious taboos."" He is careful not to say he is teaching, as ""Harvard professors are very touchy when resident fellows come here and say they teach."" He is also writing a script for a movie comedy, and building a platform to identify talent in the Arab world and allow more people to experience the extreme and unexpected success he did. ""Satire didn't begin or end with my program. I mean, it is a part of people's culture, a part of people's thoughts. So if one program is off, there are people who will find other ways."" His program showed the Arab world in a new light for many in the West, and he said he hopes more will follow in his footsteps. It's a counterbalance, if you will, to the messianic image propagated by ISIS. ""I don't want to even call them extreme Muslims. I think they are a bunch of lunatics, who instead of playing 'Grand Theft Auto' on video games, they want to do it in real life."" It may not often reach a Western audience, but Youssef said that YouTube is filled with Arabs making fun of ISIS -- for example, setting the group's favorite ""anthems"" to images of belly dancers. ""It happens with all religions ...,"" he said. ""So they are crazy, and they are a threat for me as much they are a threat to you."" Despite all Youssef's projects, many simply want him to return to the airwaves. Is he eyeing, Amanpour asked, the seat that will soon be vacated by his mentor, Stewart? ""The day that I actually have been chosen to replace Jon Stewart will be like -- it will be glorious,"" he said. ""But I don't think that Americans would like to take their political satire from a Middle Eastern guy with a thick accent. I think this is going to be even more difficult than electing a black president. ""But you know, let's hope.""","Bassem Youssef is a visiting fellow at Harvard working on ""political satire and humor""

"(CNN)The expulsions of two students by the University of Oklahoma for their role in a racist chant will likely not be the last word on the scandal. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity members can appeal the decision. More students might be expelled. And beyond the immediate issues around the now infamous incident, the university could experience a trickle-down impact for months, maybe years to come. Writing to the two students Tuesday, just two days after a video of frat members singing the racist song surfaced, OU President David Boren said they were being booted for ""leading a racist and exclusionary chant which has created a hostile educational environment for others."" They were given until close of business Friday to contest the decision. No word yet on whether either will. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said she believes there will be a constitutional challenge to the expulsions. ""It's sort of one of the first things you learn in law school ... you may disapprove of what someone says but you still defend their right to say it,"" she said. Hostin added: ""I think there'll be the arguments that these students were students, and that in our educational systems we want people to have, maybe, even a heightened level of freedom of speech."" Also unknown at this point is whether other students who appear in the video will be expelled or otherwise punished. Already, the Greek letters sigma, alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house's facade, the house will be closed as of midnight Tuesday and the university will board up the windows, following up on separate decisions by the university and the SAE national headquarters to shutter the Oklahoma chapter, Boren said. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . But he seemed to say that individual punishments could be a bit trickier. ""Well, legally, our concern is we have to demonstrate exactly how the educational experience of our students was threatened or disrupted by their actions,"" Boren said, ""and it really has to focus on the students on the bus. Did the other students have their educational experience disrupted?"" While he unwaveringly declared ""there is no room for racists and bigots"" at his university, the very thing that could keep the SAE fraternity brothers Oklahoma Sooners is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law ""prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance,"" but it also provides the parameters for determining if someone is violating the federal law, Boren said. Any punishment must be ""carefully directed"" if it's to pass constitutional muster, although he made it clear he hopes some of the students involved won't wait for legal issues to be sorted out. ""I think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus, and I hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists,"" he said. So far, no students have dropped out -- voluntarily -- but the video has cost the university's football team a top recruit as offensive lineman Jean Delance said Monday he was de-committing from the Sooners and considering other teams. It's an issue that Ber Thaddeus Bailey, director of diversity, OU student government, worries about. ""I am concerned about the trickle-down effect from this incident,"" he said. ""I do want to encourage those who are considering the University of Oklahoma that this is a great place to study, and we are going to continue to progress.""

"(CNN)Three decades ago, Steve McCurry took arguably the most iconic picture of all time. Yet even after all this time, the pre-eminent photographer brims with enthusiasm when he talks about ""Afghan Girl."" ""I knew she had an incredible look, a penetrating gaze,"" he recalls. ""But there was a crowd of people around us, the dust was swirling around, and it was before digital cameras and you never knew what would happen with the film. ""When I developed the picture, I knew it was special. I showed it to the editor of the National Geographic, and he leaped to his feet and shouted, 'that's our next cover'."" Not only did ""Afghan Girl"" become the magazine's next cover, but the most successful in its distinguished history. The striking portrait of 12-year-old Sharbat Gula, a Pashtun orphan in the Nasir Bagh refugee camp on the Afghan-Pakistan border, was taken in December 1984 and published the following year. The woman, now in her forties, has recently been found to be living in Pakistan. When McCurry reflects upon its popularity, what excites him most is the impact that this single image has had on the real world. ""People volunteered to work in the refugee camps because of that photograph,"" he says. ""Afghans are incredibly proud of it, as the girl is poor but shows great pride, fortitude and self-respect. ""It drew attention to their plight, and inspired a lot of people."" It also led the National Geographic to set up the Afghan Children's Fund -- and meant that to this day, McCurry is never charged a fare by appreciative Afghan taxi drivers. The portrait forms the centerpiece of a major retrospective exhibition of McCurry's work, which opened recently in Monza, Italy, and will run until 6 April. ""It's great to look back on my work and see how themes and connections have emerged. But I am never even remotely thinking of retiring,"" the 64-year-old tells CNN from his studio in New York. ""There are so many new places and stories that fascinate me. I have a long list of places to visit: Iran, Madagascar, Mongolia, Russia. ""I believe that when you find something you love, you should do it your whole life. Why would you retire from doing what you love? It's just not what we do."" The famous photograph is just one of thousands of extraordinary pictures that McCurry has taken over a 40-year career, during which he has won dozens of awards. One which is displayed prominently in his retrospective exhibition was taken in Kuwait in 1991, during the first Gulf War. It shows three camels silhouetted against an explosion of fire and smoke. ""Saddam Hussein had blown up 600 oil wells,"" he recalls. ""It was an environmental catastrophe. Lakes of oil were leaking all over the country, and seeping into the Gulf. ""Half of it was on fire. There were geysers of oil spurting out of the earth, making it like midnight during the day."" He spotted the camels running along the edge of an oilfield, and followed them in his jeep. But they had been blackened by the oil, and there was no way to capture a picture of them against the black cloud behind. ""Suddenly they ran in front of a burning area, and they were illuminated by fire,"" he says. ""I took the shot, and then realized I had driven into a minefield. ""I had to carefully back out, following the tire tracks I had made on the way in to avoid getting blown up."" For many years, frontline war photography like this was McCurry's stock in trade. Indeed, it enabled him to make his name. Born in Pennsylvania in 1950, McCurry -- whose right hand was permanently damaged when he fell down some stairs at the age of five -- studied theater arts at Penn State University. Two years after graduating, he moved to India in search of a freelance photography career. His big break came in the late 1970s, when he disguised himself in Afghan clothes and crossed illegally into Afghanistan, just before the Soviet invasion. There he took a set of searing photographs of people who were being attacked by their own government. ""As soon as I crossed the border, I came across about 40 houses and a few schools that were just bombed out,"" he says. ""They were literally destroying whole villages with helicopter gunships. ""This was a profound situation that really needed to be told, and few people could get access to it because it was too remote. ""I got completely caught up in the story. That's when I knew that this was what I did -- this was me."" Against a background of the Cold War, the Russians backed the Afghan army and Americans supported the Mujahideen. The lens of the Western media quickly swung towards the region, and McCurry happened to be already embedded. His pictures were soon appearing in The New York Times, TIME and Paris Match -- but not before McCurry had escaped from Afghanistan by crossing the tribal areas on foot, with his precious film sewn into his clothing. This was the beginning of many years of war photography, which he now describes as ""the gritty period"" of his career. He covered the Iran-Iraq war, the Gulf wars and several conflicts in Afghanistan, as well as those further afield in Lebanon, Cambodia and the Philippines. ""When you're working in a war zone, you're living moment to moment with people trying to kill you,"" he says. ""There are so many ways I could have been killed, with guns, bombs and shrapnel. You live with fear you could cut with a knife. ""Several times I was held up at gunpoint. My camera and money have been robbed, people have broken into my hotel room while I was sleeping. ""Many times I thought that I had pushed things too far, that it was not a good idea to enter this skirmish or battle. Many times I have thought that this isn't going to end well. ""But I have found that I get completely consumed by the importance of the story I am telling, the feeling that the world has got to know. It's never about the adrenaline. It's about the story."" Has frontline reporting become more dangerous? ""It has always been dangerous, but now there is the added dimension of trying to grab headlines,"" he says. ""You might have got kidnapped or shot in the past, but not beheaded. There was no wish to create a heinous piece of theater. ""But we can't give in. These stories have to be reported, and writers and photographers have to continue telling them."" McCurry's portfolio is far broader than his war photography, however. He has worked all over the world, from the jungles of central Africa to the mountains of Tibet, each time seeming to capture the soul of the people he photographs. ""My camera acts as a shield when I'm photographing something horrific, as it's easier to look at distressing sights through a viewfinder,"" he says. ""But when I'm not in a war zone, having a camera helps me talk to people, interact, and get involved.

"(CNN)Pope Francis has said that all he wants is to go out one day to a pizzeria ""without being recognized."" Wishful thinking, perhaps. But when you're the the leader of the Catholic world pizza comes to you. Pizzeria owner Enzo Cacialli personally handed the pope a pie on Sunday as his motorcade drove through Naples. But, not just any pizza: a Naples-style thin crust creation with ""Il Papa"" spelled out in dough and topped with yellow cherry tomatoes, a reference to the Vatican flag. A video shows Cacialli, co-owner of Pizzeria Don Ernesto, hopping a barrier with the pie in hand as the Popemobile approaches. ""Papa! Papa!"" he yelled as he ran toward the open-top vehicle, apparently unimpeded by papal minders. The video shows Pope Francis reaching down and receiving the offering. After the hand off Cacialli pumps his fist in the air, victorious, as the crowd cheers. ""I gave him the pizza and with a smile he said 'thank you,'"" Cacialli told CNN. Cacialli comes from a pizza-making family. His says his father made a pizza for President Bill Clinton when he visited Naples in 1994. When Cacialli learned Pope Francis was going to be in town he decided to follow in his father's footsteps. ""It's really hard for me to understand what I managed to do,"" Cacialli said. ""Giving a pizza you made with your own hands to the Pope is very emotional. It's really hard for me to express the value of this gesture for a man we really love and value, for a beautiful person full of humanity."" Cacialli is still waiting to hear whether Pope Francis enjoyed the edible offering.","Pizza maker Enzo Cacialli hands Pope Francis pie as motorcade drives through Naples .

"(CNN)For decades, no one has been able to convict millionaire Robert Durst. Not after his wife's disappearance. Not after his friend's suspicious death. Not even after he admitted he killed and dismembered his neighbor. But it may be Durst who does himself in with 11 words he muttered in a restroom: . ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."" Those comments were picked up on a microphone he was wearing for the HBO documentary series about him called ""The Jinx."" Apparently, the real estate heir didn't turn his microphone off when he went to the bathroom. Durst now sits in a New Orleans jail after his arrest Saturday in connection with the 2000 death of his longtime friend Susan Berman in Los Angeles. On Monday, California prosecutors said Durst was ""lying in wait"" when he shot and killed Berman because she ""was a witness to a crime."" She had been shot in the head shortly before investigators were supposed to come ask her about the disappearance of Durst's first wife in 1982. Durst will be transferred to Los Angeles to face a first-degree murder charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. When he goes to trial, could those 11 words be admitted in court? Here, several legal experts weigh in: . Yes: . His lawyer could argue that he absolutely did. ""Here's what his attorneys are going to say: They are going to say that he had an expectation of privacy,"" HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson said. ""And as a result of that, putting this in context, he excused himself and went into a private bathroom."" No: . That argument might not fly, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""That whole theory of the Constitution is that you have an expectation of privacy under certain circumstances when you're dealing with the police. But here, he's dealing with filmmakers."" Furthermore, Toobin said, Durst had a microphone on. ""You can't have an expectation of privacy when you're wearing a microphone. Yeah, he maybe forgot, but that's not good enough."" Yes: . The defense very well could, said Jackson, the HLN analyst. ""The attorneys are going to further argue that there was governmental action in as much as HBO was working very closely with the authorities. And they're going to say, isn't it coincidental how his arrest comes on the heels of the final episode of this HBO documentary?"" No: . CNN legal analyst Paul Callan doesn't think that defense will work. ""In criminal law, the police can't wire somebody up. They have to give you Miranda warnings if they're going to take a statement from you,"" he said. ""However, if a civilian is tape-recording you, as was the case here with HBO, that's admissible in court if it's relevant to the crime committed."" Yes: . He could. Susan Criss was the judge during Durst's 2003 murder trial in which he admitted to shooting an elderly neighbor and then dismembering him. She remembers how prosecutors didn't use many of his admissions. ""In our trial, he had been recorded on the phone talking to his wife and friends, making a lot of admissions, and the state never used that,"" she said. ""But he was aware that he had been recorded saying things that could implicate him in the murder that we were trying."" No: . Probably not. Section 1220 of the California Penal Code says ""evidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered against the declarant in an action to which he is a party in either his individual or representative capacity."" In this case, Durst is the declarant who spoke those words, and if they're used against him, they could be fair game. Yes: . It's a card the defense could certainly play. ""It will be up to (defense attorney) Dick DeGuerin to talk about, and I think he's going to have a field day with the idea that it wasn't an answer in response to a question, (so) that's meaningless,"" CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos said. Already, one of Durst's attorneys has said not to read too much into his client's offhand remarks. ""Your honesty would lead you to say you've said things under your breath before that you probably didn't mean,"" attorney Chip Lewis told Fox News' ""Justice With Judge Jeanine."" ""We want to contest the basis for his arrest, because I think it's not based on facts, it's based on ratings,"" DeGuerin told reporters Tuesday in New Orleans. ""So we will continue to fight for Bob. We want to get to California as quickly as we can so we can get into a court of law and try this case where it needs to be tried."" No: . The prosecution could argue Durst knew what was going on. ""Earlier in those interviews, in a previous interview for that very program, there was a break where he was caught practicing his testimony. And so he realized ... he had a mic on,"" said Criss, the judge from Durst's earlier trial. ""This is a third time he's made that mistake. That's amazing."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Real estate heir Robert Durst has been investigated in two deaths and a disappearance .

"Washington (CNN)The U.S. ambassador who resigned his post in 2012 amidst official criticism that he used a private email account for official business told CNN Friday that he was ""very surprised"" to learn that his boss at the time, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, had been doing essentially the same thing at the same time. ""I was very surprised to learn of the double standard,"" former Ambassador to Kenya and Air Force General Scott Gration told CNN. Gration noted that Cheryl Mills, the then-State Department Chief of Staff ""obviously knew Secretary Clinton was using commercial email, yet she stated my use of Gmail was one of the reasons I had to move on."" The retired Air Force Major General, who flew 274 combat missions over Iraq as a fighter pilot and served as President Obama's Special Envoy to Sudan, recalled he had been ""prohibited from sending a Gmail message to a State Department computer except in an emergency."" Considering that ""Department of Defense dot mil accounts, USAID accounts, and every Kenyan account used the same routers and security firewalls as a Gmail account,"" he took issue with State Department protocols. ""It didn't make sense to me that the State Department would ban my 'Gmail.com' while letting all other commercial and foreign accounts through its computer firewall,"" he told CNN. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton declined comment. Spokespeople at the State Department repeatedly declined to address whether any sort of double standard had been applied and instead continually noted that in the State Department Inspector General report  about the U.S. embassy being run by Gration there were ""several concerns with management and leadership"" discussed, not just about his use of private email. The Inspector General report charged that Gration ""lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission"" and ""damaged the cohesion of Embassy Nairobi's country team."" Gration said he makes ""no apology for 'rocking the boat' in the State Department to improve physical security, to enhance cyber policy, and to conduct several other initiatives that the State Department Inspector General misrepresented to build the case that Secretary Clinton's Chief of Staff used to terminate my tenure as the U.S. ambassador in 2012."" The State Department's continued referencing of the other allegations against Gration came amidst fruitless attempts by CNN to ask the department spokespeople to explain why it was acceptable for Secretary Clinton to use private email to conduct official business given that the 2012 Inspector General's report against Gration repeatedly hammered him for the use of ""commercial email for official government business"" which was considered to be ""flouting of direct instructions to adhere to Department policy."" As CNN reported Thursday, the report stated clearly that It ""is the Department's general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system, which has the proper level of security controls,"" the report stated. ""The use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss, phishing, and spoofing of email accounts, as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information. The use of unauthorized information systems can also result in the loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions. Conducting official business on non- Department automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies."" Asked if he was subsequently surprised to see this controversy erupt about his then-boss doing essentially the same thing, Gration told CNN ""I'm not surprised when any political issue becomes a controversy.  I learned long ago to do your best, do what was right, and to have a thick skin.  I still wake up each day without regrets because I still have my integrity.  That said, illegal, immoral, or unethical activities should be investigated properly, not just for political gain, but because we demand this of our public leaders. That's the only way we can preserve trust in our system of governance.  Punish crimes and forgive mistakes."" Gration said that his ""experience was somewhat different than Secretary Clinton's use of her commercial account, yet I was 'fired' for the use of Gmail in the U.S. Embassy, my insistence on improving our physical security posture, and other twisted and false allegations.  I've chosen to move on and to be better, not bitter."" He said that ""the State Department Inspector General investigators and Diplomatic Security cyber investigators conducted a full and formal investigation into my use of Gmail and the State Department computers"" and ""they dismissed the allegations against me."" The former ambassador and his wife currently live in Kenya, where he is executive chairman of a company that works to bring international investment and innovation to Kenya and East Africa. He is no longer involved in US politics and diplomacy.","Fmr. ambassador forced to resign in 2012 amidst criticism over personal email use at the State Department.
Claims accusations against him unwarranted. He took issue with State Dept. security protocol because they used the same firewall as Gmail.
Although his experience was somewhat different than Hillary Clinton's, he was ""was very surprised to learn of the double standard."""
"New Delhi (CNN)A gang of robbers struck a Christian school in eastern India on Saturday, and one of them raped a 71-year-old nun, a senior official said. The man apparently did so, because she resisted the robbers, said P.B. Salim, chief administrator of the West Bengal state's Nadia district. Previously, a church official had told CNN sister broadcaster CNN-IBN that three or four of the men had raped the woman. A group of seven to eight men allegedly barged into the school and its attached staff residence during pre-dawn hours, and the elderly Sister Superior raised an alarm and resisted, Salim said. The rape was apparently punishment for it. Later, the men tied her up along with two other nuns and the building guard. The robbers then made off with cash worth a few hundred thousand rupees (thousands of dollars), laptops and other articles, Salim said. The attacked nun is under medical care. ""Physically, she is better. But the mental trauma will take its own time to heal,"" Salim said. ""It is a very, very shameful act, first of all, to rape any woman, any female,"" Father Dominic Emmanuel of the Delhi Catholic Archdiocese said in televised comments. ""But this one becomes even worse because, first of all, she is an old lady and then on top of it, she is a nun. She is a religious (and) has consecrated her life to God and all her life she has remained a virgin."" The investigation into the burglary and rape is ongoing, and no arrests have yet been made, Salim told CNN. A series of rape cases involving girls, foreign tourists and a physiology student who died following a brutal gang rape in 2012 has hurt India's international reputation. Crowds have taken to Indian streets to protest against rape. The nation's lawmakers introduced tougher laws and punishments for sexual crimes and harassment. Despite such action, India continues to see episodes of sexual violence. For instance, five men were arrested in Kolkata in January and charged with raping a Japanese tourist. Police said the men operated as a gang and targeted single, Japanese tourists. In December, an Uber driver was charged with sexually assaulting a passenger. The incident that grabbed the world's attention was the rape of a woman by five men  on a bus in 2012. She later died of her injuries. Anti-rape activists complained when the Indian government restricted the showing of a BBC documentary about rape that included comments from one of those men. He provoked outrage around the world by blaming the victim and saying the woman ""should just be silent and allow the rape."" Official data in India show that rape cases have jumped almost 875% over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011. But campaigners say sexual assaults are underreported because of stigma and cultural factors. Experts say the causes of the high number of rapes include the nation's patriarchy, widespread poverty and lack of law enforcement in rural areas.","Official says men broke into a convent school and one sexually assaulted a septuagenarian nun .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)A Yemeni jet commanded by the capital's Houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing Yemen's deposed President in the country's south Thursday, injuring no one but marking an escalation in deadly fighting that's erupted between forces for and against the ousted leader. The jet flew from Sanaa, which Houthi rebels overtook in January, to the palace in the port city of Aden, where the jet conducted the strikes Thursday afternoon, a senior air force official said on condition of anonymity. Deposed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi was at the Aden palace compound when the first missile struck the grounds, but he then fled safely, a Hadi aide said, also on condition of anonymity. A second missile struck near the compound, but, like the first, injured no one, two officials in Aden said. Another Houthi-commanded air force jet fired a missile in downtown Aden about a half-hour later, again injuring no one, Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour said. It wasn't immediately clear what the missile struck, or what the intended target was. The airstrikes came on the same day opposing Yemeni military forces -- those commanded by Houthis, and those led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, leaving at least 13 people dead and 21 others injured, Hobtour said. The Houthis, a minority rebel group that holds sway in the nation's north but has less influence elsewhere, took control over military forces stationed near Sanaa, including the air force, as it overtook the government there in January. Hadi initially was put under house arrest in Sanaa, but he escaped last month, fleeing to Aden and declaring himself to still be president. Some military forces still are loyal to Hadi, including troops from his native province in the south. On Thursday, clashes erupted in Aden when a special forces commander loyal to the Houthis, Abdul Hafez Al Saqqaf, ordered hundreds of his troops to create checkpoints at all roads leading to Aden's airport. Watch: Who are the Houthis? The clashes were reported to be taking place on four different fronts in the airport and a surrounding military base. Passengers were stranded at the airport, with flights canceled throughout the day. Al Saqqaf's forces gave up much of their ground in Aden after pro-Hadi forces struck them with heavy artillery and tanks, a pro-Hadi military commander said on condition of anonymity. Some of the wounded in Thursday's fighting were in critical condition, officials said, suggesting the death toll could rise. The Houthis entered Sanaa in September, demanding a greater share of political power. They took control over a period of months, seizing the presidential palace in January. The unrest has plunged Yemen deeper into chaos. Hadi had issued a presidential decree replacing Al Saqqaf two weeks ago, but the decree was not implemented. Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

"(CNN)Police in Mesa, Arizona, know some things about Ryan Elliot Giroux, accused in a string of shootings that left one man dead and five people wounded. He's 41, has an extensive criminal record and served time in prison, according to online inmates records. He's on probation. Giroux used to have tattoos indicating white supremacist beliefs on his face but apparently had them removed, according to photos. One thing investigators don't know: What caused Giroux to allegedly go on a deadly rampage. On Thursday morning, Giroux made his first court appearance. He faces multiple charges, including murder, armed robbery with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, aggravated assault and burglary. The prosecutor requested $2 million bond and the judge imposed it. Grioux has been sent to prison twice for felonies, including an attempt to commit aggravated assault. He was sentenced to seven years and six months behind bars in July 2007, but was released in October 2013, according to online inmate records. His probation runs through October 2016. He also had a run-in with authorities in Santa Monica, California. He allegedly committed assault with a knife in the early morning hours of March 26, 2006, and was detained by witnesses, said Santa Monica Police spokesman Sgt. Rudy Camarena. Giroux was arrested on accusations of attempted murder and parole violation, but police records weren't immediately clear on how the case was resolved, Camarena said Thursday. Police are looking for a motive in the first shooting on Wednesday, but say the other violence happened as the suspect tried to rob people and get away from authorities. The first shots were fired after the suspect got into an argument at the Tri-City Inn with three people that he likely knew, according to Det. Esteban Flores of the Mesa police. One man shot at the Tri-City Inn died, Flores said. Police identified him as David James Williams, 29, reported CNN affiliate KNXV. The motel is across the street from the East Valley Institute of Technology. According to a police press release, the suspect next shot a man during a carjacking at a nearby restaurant and drove away in a stolen Honda Accord. Grioux tried to carjack another vehicle but failed, police said, and crossed the street to break into an apartment, where he shot and tried to rob a fifth person. He went to another apartment complex and shot a sixth person, police said, before fleeing to a condominium complex. Flores said Mesa's SWAT team found Grioux in a vacant second-floor condo. Police used a Taser stun gun to subdue him. Police said one man is in critical condition at a hospital, KNXV reported. The other victims, including the mother of the slain man, were treated and released from hospitals, KNXV reported. Authorities on Thursday released a photo of a bruised Giroux in which he had a tattoo on his neck but no tattoos on his face. An Arizona Department of Correction's photo released earlier showed a heavily tattooed Giroux, with the words ""Skin"" and ""head"" tattooed over his eyebrows. The number 88 was on his left temple, with additional ink on his chin and neck. ""Those are typical tattoos that you do see sometimes on white supremacists, but we don't know if that has anything to do with what happened today,"" Flores said. Neo-Nazis use the number 88 as an abbreviation for ""Heil Hitler.""  H is the eighth letter in the alphabet, so the Nazi salute becomes 88 in shorthand. Flores said he believes all of the shooting victims were white, with one being white and of Hispanic descent. ""I have no information that his (Giroux's) affiliations or beliefs had anything to do with what occurred today,"" Flores said. News of the shootings caught the attention of the state's senior U.S. senator. ""My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families impacted by the tragedy in Mesa today,"" U.S. Sen. John McCain said in a statement released Wednesday.  ""Our deepest thanks are with the Valley police and first responders who assisted the victims and tracked down the perpetrator to bring this dangerous situation to an end."" Mesa is about 20 miles east of Phoenix and is Arizona's third-largest city.

"(CNN)A massive power outage spread across Turkey on Tuesday, blacking out a broad swath of the country and affecting some flights. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said all possible causes were under investigation, including terrorism. Trams and subways were idled in Istanbul -- with more than 14 million inhabitants, the largest city in the country and the fifth largest in the world. Homes and offices were left without electricity. ""I am sitting in my apartment,"" CNN producer Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul. ""No lights. No electricity."" The capital, Ankara, some 250 miles from Istanbul, also was affected. The outage extended to 45 of Turkey's 81 provinces. The semiofficial Anadolu Agency quoted Energy Minister Taner Yildiz as saying the cause of the outage was unknown. Yildiz, speaking during a visit to Slovakia, said he could neither confirm nor deny that a cyberattack had triggered the blackout, the Anadolu Agency reported. Flightradar24, which maps real-time flight data on the Internet, tweeted that the outage was ""affecting flights,"" and said 11 of its 16 air traffic monitoring systems receivers -- as distinct from the country's air traffic control system -- were not working. The Turkish Electricity Transmission Co. blamed the outage on a problem with transmission lines, Anadolu Agency reported. The utility said an investigation was in progress, as were efforts to restore power, the news agency said. The outage began at 10:36 a.m. (3:36 a.m. ET). Nearly two hours later, according to Anadolu Agency, about 15% of the power had been restored to Istanbul and Ankara, including in some subway stations. Power also was beginning to flow again to a number of provinces that had been cut off, the agency reported. By midafternoon, Yildiz said, 90% of Istanbul's power had been restored. ""Crowded places such as metro stations have been given electricity, and we believe the rest of the country should be fully powered shortly,"" he said.

"(CNN)Milan has Moxy, while much of Europe is painted Blu. Jaz in the City is playing in Amsterdam come September. EVEN increases the odds of a good night's sleep, while Tune is in harmony with scaled-down budgets. And then there's the vibrant Vib and a new venue, Venu, soon arriving in Dubai. These statements begin to make sense once you realize that they're all the names of modern hotel brands. According to Chekitan S. Dev, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, hotels traditionally have been named after an owner or a place. But more recently, he says, ""the naming process has evolved from an off-the-cuff process into something far more systematic."" So what's behind this influx of idiosyncratic hotel names, replete with misspellings and unexpected word usages? Look to millennials and psychographics -- the study of personality, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. Psychologists say the millennial psychographic is made up of independent-minded, adventurous individuals in search of new experiences. Hospitality brands are crafting their marketing strategies accordingly. ""Hotel companies are lazering in on consumer needs by using psychographic data in a big way,"" says Matthew Von Ertfelda, Marriott's vice president for insight, strategy and innovation. The explosion of social media also has a starring role in the name game. Brands of the 21st century need to have handles that resonate in the global, online world, say the pros. ""Thanks to social media, millennials are the first global generation,"" says Dr. Donna Quadri-Felitti, academic chair of New York University's School of Professional Studies Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. ""And since this generation is so enamored with texting and tweeting, hotels really have to think how names will play in the new media world."" For social media purposes, the number of characters in a name counts. Spelling is often sacrificed in the quest for brevity. But another reason for purposeful misspellings may be legal. Spelling is often set into an uncommon form to retain meaning while being trademarkable. ""The odder the name, the less likely someone has already captured it,"" says Cornell professor Dev. ""That's important in terms of intellectual property protection."" It may explain why Venu and Vib are missing an ""e."" Venu is a just-announced lifestyle brand, launching its first property in Dubai in 2017. According to parent company Jumeirah Hotels & Resorts, it's designed to give travelers ""the freedom to write their own story, their own narrative, to build their own scene."" Best Western's new hotel entry, called Vib, is pronounced ""vibe."" ""We tried to come up with names that celebrated individuality, while also connoting a vibrant spirit,"" says Dick Lew, a partner at Houston-based Acumen Design, a branding firm brought in to hone the name and the image. Hence Vib, which is derived from ""vibrant."" Color also plays a big part in hotel branding. ""We incorporated a bright persimmon red in the design and the logo, in order to reflect the (Vib) brand's bold personality,"" says Lew. Moxy, the new Marriott partnership with IKEA, is going after ""a sassy, determined, individualistic consumer,"" according to Marriott's Von Ertfelda. The first Moxy opened at Milan's Malpensa Airport in September and more are coming in Europe this year. ""Naming Moxy was a four-month process involving a great deal of brainstorming,"" says Von Ertfelda. ""Once we came up with it, we knew we had a name with emotional resonance that hit a global sweet spot. ""At the same time, though, our lawyers noted the name had to be 'ownable and trademarkable.'"" The change of spelling from moxie to Moxy achieved that. According to Von Ertfelda, senior creative director Maria Rezende-Heiston selected hot pink for the Moxy logo to ""appeal to those who aren't afraid to express themselves"" while using a ""curved font to convey a sense of rhythm, fluidity and independence."" Color is also key to hotel operator Carlson Rezidor, which is hueing (sic) toward Red and Blu. Blu came about in 2009, after airline SAS withdrew from a partnership with Radisson. After the split, Radisson SAS, a collection of European design hotels, needed a new name. ""We wanted to replace SAS with an equally short name,"" says Rose Anderson, vice president of branding for the Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group. ""We liked using blue from the old SAS logo, because it brought in the heritage of the former brand. ""At the same time, we were looking for a word with positive worldwide connotations ... and blue is the world's favorite color."" So blue or bleu became Blu, a trademarkable spelling. Carlson Rezidor recently announced a new Red brand that will, according to Anderson, ""build on the Blu concept and further leverage Radisson's brand awareness."" New brands are also being dubbed with what may seem to be random nouns. But there's nothing random about them. Last year, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) rolled out EVEN, a new brand cultivated for the growing wellness-minded audience, with two properties in the United States. EVEN expresses the desire for the balance travelers are seeking, says an IHG spokesperson. In its logo, specific colors were chosen to represent elements of nature. The four vertical bars of the logo are off-kilter, while the EVEN letters are composed on a flat horizontal line, representing the brand promise of helping guests stay in balance. Malaysia-based Tune Hotels provides ""five-star beds at a one-star price."" The group has more than 40 properties worldwide, including five in London. Some in its management group were previously senior executives in the music business. It makes sense, then, that a travel company with a musical name would attempt to strike a global chord. Adding to the medley of avant garde brands, Germany's Steigenberger Hotel Group's Amsterdam hotel Jaz in the City will open in September, with others scheduled to follow. According to Steigenberger Hotel Group, coming Jaz in the City properties will be ""hip and happening hotels"" that ""move to the rhythm of today's curious global traveler"" who has a ""desire to embrace authentic experiences in a city hotel."" You can't explore the hospitality industry's desire to appeal to the millennial mindset without nodding to W Hotels by Starwood. The brand now seems to have been ahead of its time with hotels that opened in pre-social media 1998. ""Starwood was the first hotel company to look directly at the customer as it evolved a new brand,"" says Paul James, global brand leader of W Hotels Worldwide, St. Regis and The Luxury Collection. W's target customer was a fashionable, high-energy individual -- someone who'd now likely be described as having a millennial psychographic. Starwood defined the brand by adding its ""Whatever, Whenever"" tagline to the simple W logo. Cornell's Dev says Starwood further imbued the brand with meaning by using words like witty, warm and welcoming in its advertising and marketing material. More than 15 years later, the W Hotel brand has more than 70 properties open or in development worldwide. Journalist Laura Powell started covering the travel industry for CNN in the 1980s.

"(CNN)Have Rick and his fellow survivors finally found a place they can settle in for the long term? That was the question left still unanswered at the end of Sunday night's season finale of ""The Walking Dead,"" and a finale record 15.8 million viewers tuned in to find out the answer. Rick was back in ""Ricktatorship"" mode, telling the residents of Alexandria that he knew what it took to survive and they should follow him. That led up to one of many moments where we gasped during the 90-minute finale. Here are five of the biggest gaspworthy moments: . 1. Morgan is back . We've literally been looking for him all season, and Rick's old friend Morgan -- going all the way back to the first episode -- made a return appearance, wielding a stick he used to kick walker, and human, butt when necessary. And it was definitely necessary once he was captured by two men wearing W's on their heads, who, we would later learn, wanted to turn Morgan into a walker in order to join a horde of walkers they controlled. 2. Daryl looks done for . It was Daryl who happened upon that horde, and he and Aaron were soon surrounded and forced into a car, with little chance of escape -- that is, until Morgan rescued them. We rarely believe what we hear when there are rumors that Daryl might die, but that was a close one. 3. Carol and her casserole . Melissa McBride continues to steal scenes left and right lately, and her threatening of Pete while lending him a casserole may be one of the best scenes in the series' history so far. 4. Glenn gets shot . We seriously thought Glenn was a goner after a vengeful Nicholas shot him, then left him for a large group of walkers to attack. Somehow, Glenn survived and attacked Nicholas, but stopped short of killing him. That's our Glenn, always doing the right thing when it comes down to it. 5. Rick's memorable walker encounter . Just when you thought you'd seen everything, Rick literally squeezed a walker's neck then discharged a round causing the walker to spray out blood -- a walker he presented to the residents of Alexandria, in a bid to lead them toward survival. Rick was then rudely interrupted by Pete, who slashed Reg's throat in a fit of anger. At that point, Deanna told Rick to off Pete, which he did. Phew! It was one of the most intense episodes of the already hyperintense series, and our group of survivors somehow made it through. Fans on Twitter were into it.

"(CNN)The family of Ashley Summers may have reason to be hopeful again. In May 2013, when police discovered three young women who had been imprisoned inside a nondescript Cleveland home for nearly a decade, Summers' family and law enforcement hoped one of the women would be Ashley, who disappeared in Cleveland around the same time as the other women. But the discovery turned out to be unrelated to Ashley's case and there was no new information about her whereabouts. But nearly eight years since she was last seen or heard from, the family's optimism has been restored by an unlikely discovery her step-grandmother made on the Rhode Island Most Wanted website in January. An ATM surveillance photo -- released by the Warwick, Rhode Island, Police Department in late October -- depicts an unidentified woman with a familiar face, Special Agent Vicki Anderson of the FBI Cleveland Division said. ""This is an incredible lookalike,"" Anderson said of the photo. The resemblance to Ashley, who would now be 21, is ""strikingly similar,"" she added. The woman in the photo, along with an unidentified man she appears with, was being sought by Rhode Island police as a suspect in a string of check and identification thefts in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the FBI said. Ashley's step-grandmother alerted the FBI about the photo, Anderson said. ""There's nothing that tells us that it is her, but there's nothing telling us that it's not her either,"" Anderson said. Still, she considers the surveillance footage to be a breakthrough in the case, given that the FBI has found no legitimate sightings or social media activity by Ashley since she disappeared on July 6, 2007. ""It's the best lead we have,"" Anderson said. ""We've had other supposed lookalikes, but nothing that has looked this similar. We consider this a huge tip for us."" Because it is not possible to see the license plate of the car the couple was driving, Anderson said the FBI will rely exclusively on help from the public. ""The FBI is utilizing a billboard campaign, social media and any news outlet that will air these photos for us,"" Anderson said. In the 2013 case, two of the missing women had been identified and police said they had disappeared within four years of when Ashley went missing -- and within five blocks of where she was last seen. ""At first, when they said the third girl wasn't identified, I was hoping one would be Ashley,"" Debra Summers, her aunt, told CNN at the time. But the family's nightmare continued. ""There is no new information that's come to light about her: Ashley Summers is an active, open investigation,"" Cleveland Police Deputy Chief Ed Tomba said at the time. ""I can assure you that her disappearance was part of our questioning of the three subjects that we brought in.""","Ashley Summers disappeared on July 6, 2007, when she was 14 .

"(CNN)A Louisiana judge ruled Monday that Robert Durst, the millionaire real estate heir charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail. That's no big surprise. In 2001 -- the last time he was accused of murder and released on bail -- Durst fled to Pennsylvania, where authorities caught him after he tried to shoplift a sandwich from a supermarket. As the attorneys sparred in court and witnesses testified Monday, they revealed new details about the investigation that led to Durst's March 14 arrest, and set the stage for what will surely be a fierce legal battle. After the hearing, Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, spoke with CNN's Jean Casarez. Here are some key details from Monday's hearing and the interview: . Durst, who appeared in court wearing an orange prison uniform and shackles, was arrested after federal agents tracked his cell phone, according to information presented in court Monday. Investigators knew he'd left his Houston condo with five suitcases on March 10. And, since a warrant allowed them to track his cell phone, they saw when it pinged a tower 85 miles east, in Beaumont, Texas. But suddenly, he had stopped using it. Investigators thought the trail had gone cold. ""They had no indication of his movement,"" said Jim O'Hearn, an investigator for the Orleans Parish district attorney's office. But then, authorities tracked him to New Orleans after he called his voice mail twice from a Marriott there, O'Hearn testified. That's where FBI agents found and arrested him. Last week, court documents revealed Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, 5 ounces of marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a neck-to-head latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash, mostly in $100 bills. Among his possessions, he also had a UPS tracking number. The package was later intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said in court Monday. It contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. It's a case Durst even has made himself. In ""The Jinx,"" the HBO documentary that featured him, Durst said: ""You can't give someone charged with murder bail because they're going to run away, of course. Goodbye, $250,000. Goodbye, jail. I'm out."" In a seconds-long news conference after the hearing Monday, Durst attorney DeGuerin said he had no hope for bail and the judge's decision was not surprising. The legal team, however, did obtain ""a lot of information,"" he said, and a preliminary hearing was set for April 2. ""All in all, I think this has been a very good day for us,"" he said on the courthouse steps. He walked off without elaborating. DeGuerin cast doubt Monday on the validity of the Los Angeles arrest warrant that led to Durst's detention, and argued that items found in the hotel room search shouldn't be admissible because detectives may not have had a search warrant at the time. He also said a detective and prosecutor interrogated Durst for three hours without his attorney present. Since the weapons and drugs charges Durst faces in New Orleans are based on what investigators say they found in his hotel room, this is likely to come up again. But prosecutors argued that the matter at hand Monday was whether he is a flight risk or a danger to the community. The judge sided with the prosecution Monday. But this is just the first step in what will likely be a lengthy legal battle. ""As long as Louisiana wants us here, well, we'll stay here. We'll fight,"" DeGuerin said Monday. But the bigger courtroom fight will likely unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last week. Durst awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of ""lying in wait"" and killing Susan Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she ""was a witness to a crime."" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills, California, home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Robert Durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. ""I just don't think that they had sufficient evidence to have him arrested,"" DeGuerin said Monday. ""They had a lot of suspicion. They've always had a lot of suspicion. And that television show just added to that suspicion."" It's not the first time Durst has been accused of murder. He admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor in a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. On Monday, police said there was a connection between Durst and a college student who disappeared from Vermont's Middlebury College in 1971. In response to a question at a Tuesday news conference from CNN, Middlebury Police Chief Tom Hanley said: ""There's nothing in the files to indicate (Durst) was questioned"" at the time of her disappearance. ""We don't know if they ever had any personal contact,"" the chief added.  The connection in the case was one of proximity, Hanley said. Durst owned a health-food store in Middlebury, and Lynne Schulze was last seen across the street from the store near a bus stop. She had purchased dried prunes from the store earlier. DeGuerin brushed off the accusation, saying that his client ""may have been in Chicago when Jimmy Hoffa disappeared."" Other cases in upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are also getting a new look. Durst was placed on suicide watch, according to police, but DeGuerin said last week that Durst needed to be in a hospital setting, not because of the possibility of suicide, but because he has serious medical conditions. The 71-year-old is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said last week. ""At the same time he was in the hospital he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,"" DeGuerin said. Durst appeared in court Monday with his head shaved, the stent prominent. DeGuerin also said that Durst is ""mildly autistic"" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism. ""He's quiet and he's reserved and he's actually bashful. But he's always been looked upon as a little bit odd,"" DeGuerin said. ""And what we discovered 15 years ago was that he's autistic, mildly autistic, but it explains a lot of his, what others look upon as unusual or bizarre behavior."" But DeGuerin said his client's health struggles don't mean he's incompetent to stand trial. And DeGuerin said they're eager to go to court and fight the accusations against him. ""He's a little frail and he has some memory problems sometimes,"" DeGuerin said. ""But he's not incompetent."" CNN's Anne Woolsey, Amanda Watts, Jean Casarez and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","Police chief in Vermont says Robert Durst owned store where college student bought prunes before she disappeared .

"(CNN)A bill that would allow Utah to use firing squads to execute some death-row prisoners passed in the state Senate on Tuesday. The measure, which passed 18 to 10, will be sent to Gov. Gary Herbert, who has not said whether he will sign it into law or veto the bill. Herbert released a statement on the legislation, which would add death by firing squad as an option in a state that uses lethal injection. ""Our statute is clear that lethal injection is the method by which (an execution) will happen. We have no intent to change that,"" he said. The law would give the state the option to use a five-member squad in cases where the drugs necessary for lethal injection aren't available 30 days before the date set for the execution. ""Our state, as is the case with states around the country, is finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the substances required to perform a lethal injection. We are dedicated to pursuing all reasonable and legal options to obtain those substances to make sure that, when required, we are in a position to carry out this very serious sentence by lethal injection,"" the governor said. Eight people are on Utah's death row. Utah banned death by firing squad in 2004, though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death. The last execution by firing squad was in 2010, and it was also the most recent execution in Utah. A Utah firing squad also executed Gary Gilmore in 1977, the first death by capital punishment after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty the prior year. In recent years, states have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions. Texas nearly out of execution drug . The European manufacturers of pentobarbital, an anesthetic, explicitly banned U.S. prisons from using its drug in executions. Some states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three-drug cocktail. In April, Oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug cocktail in an execution that went awry. Clayton Lockett, a convicted rapist and murderer, writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered. It took 43 minutes for him to die. Last week, Georgia postponed an execution because the drugs appeared ""cloudy.""  The state also indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures, officials said. Georgia halts executions to analyze lethal drug cocktail . CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.","Firing squads were an option in Utah before they were banned in 2004 .
New law would allow them as execution method if proper drugs not available for lethal injection .
Many states are having problems getting the drugs ."
"(CNN)For a generation of moviegoers in the early 1990s, ""Pretty Woman"" was a cultural touchstone. The breezy comedy had all the key elements of romantic fantasy: a plucky, down-on-her-luck heroine, a rich, dashing prince and a Cinderella love story with a fairy-tale ending. Most of all it had a lesser-known actress named Julia Roberts, whose radiant smile and coltish charm lit up the screen. The movie, which celebrates its 25th anniversary on Monday, grossed $463 million worldwide and made her the biggest female star in Hollywood. But how does it stand up today? Not everyone is a fan. Some critics complain the Garry Marshall film, whose female lead is an unrefined prostitute rescued from the streets by Richard Gere's elegant millionaire, degrades women and glorifies materialism. Here are some of the leading pro-and-con arguments about the movie. First, the cons: . It whitewashes the realities of prostitution . The movie glosses over the less-than-glamorous motivations that can lead women into sex work, says Katie Hail-Jares, a board member of the Sex Workers Outreach Project (SWOP USA). Most sex workers that Hail-Jares encounters through street-based outreach are not in it for a lark, or because they lack the drive to succeed, she says. They do it out of economic necessity after encountering roadblocks to traditional employment such as lack of education, a criminal record or sexual discrimination, she said. On one hand Roberts' character, Vivian, is a compelling protagonist who dispels the stereotype of the drug-addicted ""crack whore"" with little ambition, Hail-Jares said. On the other hand, the movie implies that by virtue of her beauty, drive and apparent drug-free lifestyle, Roberts is the exceptional sex worker who -- unlike her pal Kit, for example -- deserves a better life. ""What's problematic is how it portrays sex work at large, like she's the only one worth saving,"" said Hail-Jares, a Ph.D. candidate in criminology at American University. ""You get the sense that she's not the norm, and that allows us to get invested in her while not necessarily worrying about the welfare of other women who fall into the (sex worker) stereotype."" Vivian's exit from sex work thanks to Gere's character is also troubling, she says. ""In the movie she's able to fill economic void with Edward's money but in reality that doesn't happen,"" she says. It's demeaning to women . Like ""My Fair Lady,"" the movie is another reimagining of ""Pygmalion,"" the George Bernard Shaw play about a crass, impoverished girl given a redemptive makeover by a sophisticated male mentor. Daryl Hannah was one of numerous well-known actresses who turned down the part, saying it was ""degrading for the whole of womankind."" The Vivian character is clearly intelligent, and values love over money. But she also has no apparent career goals beyond becoming the kept woman of a wealthy businessman. ""'Pretty Woman' may be a fantasy but it's a deeply sexist, consumerist fantasy,"" wrote Rachael Johnson last year for Bitch Flicks, a feminist movie site. ""Admire Julia and Richard's beauty, and sing along to Orbison or Roxette, but never forget that it is one of the most misogynist, patriarchal, classist, consumerist, and lookist movies ever to come out of Hollywood."" It celebrates greed . Although he is dutifully appearing on TV this month to promote ""Pretty Woman's"" anniversary, Gere in the past has publicly dismissed the movie for glorifying Wall Street corporate raiders like his ruthless Edward character, who dismantles struggling companies. ""It made those guys seem dashing, which was wrong. Thankfully, today we are all more skeptical of those guys,"" he told Woman's Day magazine in Australia in 2012. The movie also depicts Vivian's evolution from streetwalker to Beverly Hills socialite through an orgiastic shopping spree during which Gere promises to spend ""an obscene amount of money"" on her. ""Ideologically, 'Pretty Woman' is a love song to consumerism and capitalism,"" said Bitch Flicks' Johnson. ""'Pretty Woman' depicts a world where everyone is either a card-carrying member of the corporate caste or an obliging subordinate ... It is obsessed with things (hotel suites, private jets, fancy clothes) and encourages the audience to share its obsession with things."" And now the pros: . No, it actually empowers women . Despite her lowly profession, Vivian is no pushover. One of the film's earliest scenes shows her refusing Kit's suggestion that they work for a pimp, saying ""we say who, we say when, we say how much."" Later, she negotiates the terms of her relationship with Edward and is quick to speak up when she feel she's being mistreated. She humanizes him and even takes over driving Edward's borrowed Lotus when he can't handle a stick shift. ""She dictates the way she wishes to be treated; when he offers her the status of a mistress, she dictates the status of a full equal,"" writes Brigit McCone in a more recent Bitch Flicks piece titled, ""Why 'Pretty Woman' Should Be Considered a Feminist Classic."" ""Let us never forget that when the prince rescues her, she rescues him right back."" Its shopping scenes are revenge-fantasy bliss . Ask some ""Pretty Woman"" fans to name their favorite scene and they don't mention Vivian's swoony moments with Edward. They talk about that part in the middle when she hits Rodeo Drive for a shopping spree. Spurned at first by snooty salespeople, Vivian later buys a slew of expensive outfits with Edward's money and then returns -- dressed to the nines and carrying handfuls of shopping bags -- to one boutique that had shunned her. ""You work on commission, right?"" she asks a bitchy saleswoman. ""Uh, yes."" ""Big mistake. Big. Huge,"" she says, turning on her heels to leave. ""I have to go shopping now."" That's why in the 1997 comedy ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,"" Michele (Lisa Kudrow) tears up while watching the movie, saying, ""I just get really happy when they finally let her shop."" Lighten up. As slick entertainment, the movie works . Sure, its story is ridiculous on many levels. For all its modern trappings (and R rating) it's also deeply old-fashioned: Take out the sex and prostitution and it could be a Disney movie. But Gere and Roberts, despite their 18-year age difference, have genuine chemistry. The interplay between her goofy exuberance and his bemused stoicism is mostly effective. And Roberts' charisma carries the movie through its weaker spots. The script also has some zingers, as when Edward asks, ""What makes you think I'm a lawyer?"" and Vivian answers, ""You have that sharp, useless look about you."" On paper ""Pretty Woman,"" initially conceived as a gritty drama, shouldn't work. But it does -- if you don't think too much. ""All these years later, it holds up remarkably well, if you can turn off that think-piece portion of your brain,"" wrote Stephanie Merry this week in the Washington Post. ""(Is she a feminist icon? Is she only worthy of love when in Rodeo Drive's finest? Is this just ""My Fair Lady"" with sex? Just give up already and embrace the absurdity.)""","""Pretty Woman,"" the Julia Roberts-Richard Gere romantic comedy, was released March 23, 1990 .
Pros: Roberts (as Vivian) is empowered and shows humanity; there a real ""zingers"" in the dialogue .
Cons: The movie glosses over harsh realities of prostitution and celebrates consumerism ."
"New Delhi, India (CNN)Do not generalize India as a country of rapists. That was the firm message from the German ambassador in New Delhi after a professor back home was accused of turning down a male Indian student's application for an internship due to the South Asian nation's ""rape problem."" Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger never did such a thing, according to her and the University of Leipzig. The university points out four of her 30 students and two of her laboratory interns come from India; while it wasn't clear how many of them were men, the university said 29 of its 44 Indian students total are male. Still, Beck-Sickinger has admitted making a mistake by engaging the rejected intern candidate with talk about rape in Indian society and how the issue spurred ""many (other) female professors in Germany (have) decided to no longer accept male Indian students for these reasons."" ""It was never my intention to make a defamatory comment about Indian society,"" she said, according to a statement posted on the website of the University of Leipzig. ""I do not have anything against Indian students -- on the contrary. I sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings I may have hurt."" Marital rape: Why is it legal in India? The firestorm began with a recent post on the social-networking site Quora. It featured what appeared to be screenshots of email excerpts involving someone in the University of Leipzig's biochemistry department. They fell under this provocative headline: ""What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women?"" The post didn't identify Beck-Sickinger, blacking out the name of the emails' author. But it did lead with this statement that was later linked to her: ""Unfortunately I don't accept any Indian male students for internships. We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female students in the group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support."" The thing is, Beck-Sickinger says she ""never wrote"" such a message, claiming this email was ""put together from individual segments taken from different mails."" ""I do not reject students because of reasons of race or gender, "" she added. ""I am by no means racist or xenophobic in any way."" Here's what the University of Leipzig says did happen: The professor told the candidate ""the laboratories are fully occupied."" The Indian applicant ""didn't accept"" this rejection, the university says, and went back-and-forth with Beck-Sickinger over email. During that exchange, Beck-Sickinger wrote things that she later regretted -- excerpts of which were posted to Quora and the university acknowledged as legitimate. Speaking about how Indian men might be stereotyped due to reports about alarming instances of rape in their native country, she said, ""I fully agree that this is a generalization and may not apply to individuals. However it is also unbelievable that the Indian society is not able to solve this problem for many years now."" India bans rape documentary . Beck-Sickinger referred to regular reports of ""multi-rape crimes"" and abuse of female tourists that, ""for me ... demonstrate the attitude of society towards (women)."" Such incidents have moved other female professors to reject male Indians ""and currently other European female associations are joining."" ""Of course we cannot change or influence the Indian society,"" she added, ""but only take our consequences here in Europe."" The idea that the professor wouldn't accept male Indians for internships -- as reported by Quora and denied by the University of Leipzig -- riled up some in India, a number of whom wrote on the Quora thread. One user, identified as Sas Vijay, said, ""Don't leave this issue. It is a serious fault to generalize people on such grounds. File a complaint."" Another user, posting as Hemanth Sriteja, wrote, ""I don't wanna come to an era where I should say 'Hii (sic), I'm from India, I'm not a rapist."" One person echoing that view publicly is Michael Steiner, Germany's ambassador to India. ""Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offense to these women and men ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in India; and it is an offense to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians,"" Steiner wrote Monday in a letter posted on the embassy website. ""Let's be clear: India is not a country of rapists."" The ambassador urged Beck-Sickinger ""to learn more about the diverse, dynamic and fascinating country and the many welcoming and open-minded people of India so that you could correct a simplistic image, which — in my opinion — is particularly unsuitable for a professor and teacher."" CNN's Harmeet Shah Sing and journalist Kunal Sehgal reported from India, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

"(CNN)A ballerina dancing in a music box and a girl sat in an armchair drinking tea surrounded by flowers. This is how two of China's most popular websites chose to celebrate International Women's Day Sunday,  unleashing a storm of criticism, especially on social media, which ridiculed their home page ""doodles"" as sexist stereotypes. ""May the world treat you gently,"" the video-sharing site Youku told its female users. Search engine Baidu had no explicit message for its visitors, but the rotating ballerina turned into a bride and then a mom with a stroller. Internet users were quick to point out how the efforts of Baidu, China's biggest search engine, and Youku,  dubbed China's YouTube, contrasted with global rival Google. Its doodle depicted women in several different professions, including a scientist, artist, astronaut, chef, musician, teacher and volleyball player. ""This is how you define women and celebrate them!"" said Weibo user @Zoexiaoyizi of Baidu's music box. ""Google's doodle just makes their stupidity even worse."" Guo Weiqing, a professor at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, said that the companies' choice of imagery suggested that women are there only to be taken care of and look pretty -- and the real world of business should be left to men. ""Internet companies conveying such a narrow definition of women isn't good. It's exactly the opposite of the International Women's Day mission, which is fighting for gender equality,"" he told CNN. Baidu and Youku didn't immediately respond to calls for comment. The doodle uproar came as Chinese authorities detained several women right's activists this weekend. Some of them had planned to hold a nationwide protest against sexual harassment. On Monday, five were still being held police, said an activist and a friend of the women, who asked not to be identified. Beijing traditionally cracks down on activists during important meetings like this week's National People's Congress (NPC). ""In other countries, doing such things on International Women's Day is natural, while in China you get detained for fighting for women's rights,"" she said. ""Everything we've done is mild and done legally -- we call for gender equality in the college entrance exam and more toilet spots for women,"" she added. Under Chairman Mao Zedong, women famously ""held up half the sky"" but there is a growing sense that Chinese women today face more, not less, discrimination than in the past. The New York Times reported last month that women make up fewer than one in 10 board members at the country's top 300 companies. And China's state-run media often appears more concerned with women's looks and marital status than equal rights. Showing the same tin ear as Baidu and Youku, the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper,  published an online gallery entitled ""Beauty with brains."" It featured 18 snapshots of female journalists covering the NPC in Beijing this week. And during the Lunar New Year holidays last month, a television gala watched by 690 million people included comedy skits mocking overweight and unmarried women. Incensed feminists called for an end to the annual televised extravaganza in an online petition. Just weeks earlier, Zhou Guoping, an influential writer, enraged many when he said that ""a man can have thousands of ambitions but a woman only one"" --  to give birth. Guo, the professor, said that more and more women aren't happy with the gender roles Chinese society ascribes to them, and this year's string of ""sexist incidents"" reflects men's concerns that women aren't as ""feminine"" as they once were. ""They hope women will return to the way they're supposed to be."" CNN Intern Harvard Zhang contributed to this report .","International Women's Day doodles stir controversy in China .

"(CNN)Lynn Smith used to lead a fast-paced life as the owner of a London-based  film props company. However her first love has always been art. Taking the plunge into the unknown, Smith decided to sell her business, say goodbye to her friends, and move to Mauritius to pursue a career as an artist full time. ""I was passionate about my business as well, it was amazing, my job was wonderful,"" Smith says, ""but I always wanted to be an artist since I was very, very young. A teacher put me off it at school and I didn't go down that road, and I regretted it."" Smith chose Mauritius because she had fallen in love with the lush beauty of the tropical island on previous trips to visit her son, who lives there.

"(CNN)About to have a baby? Congratulations! Now, please keep your feet on the ground. A passenger on a US Airways flight from Philadelphia to Charlotte, North Carolina, had to make a stop in Greensboro when she went into labor on Tuesday, according to CNN affiliate WXII. Thankfully, the baby, named Nylah, waited until her mother had landed to arrive on airport property. Mother and child were later transported to Women's Hospital in Greensboro, where the hospital said both were doing well. The flight took off for Charlotte after the woman left the aircraft. There have been a couple of airline-related births recently. A child was born on Southwest Airlines Flight 623 shortly after takeoff on December 9. The aircraft departed from San Francisco bound for Phoenix but diverted to Los Angeles International Airport. A nurse and doctor on board assisted with the delivery. On December 31, Delta Air Lines Flight 2566 from San Francisco to Minneapolis was diverted to Salt Lake City when a passenger went into labor during the flight. The woman was taken by the local fire department to the University of Utah Hospital, where she gave birth to a boy. US Airways requires passengers with a due date within seven days of flight to provide a doctor's certificate, dated within 72 hours of departure, ""stating that he or she has examined you and determined that you are fit to fly."" If the mother on Tuesday's flight had been flying American Airlines, which owns US Airways, she might not have been able to travel. American hasn't created a single policy for both brands, and its policy is more restrictive. A medical certificate is required for travelers wishing to fly within four weeks of their delivery dates ""in a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy,"" according to the airline's website. She couldn't travel on domestic American flights of less than five hours within seven days before and after a the delivery date without a medical certificate and permission from the airline. Delta Air Lines doesn't restrict pregnant women from flying, but the airline doesn't waive ticket change fees and penalties for pregnancy.

"(CNN)Nigerians go to the polls Saturday to determine who will lead Africa's most populous nation. The stakes are high in this election as the nation faces intensified attacks by extremist group Boko Haram. With security catapulting into a key issue, which candidate will voters trust to keep them safe? As Nigeria decides, here's what you need to know: . Nigeria is home to about 173 million people and is considered a powerhouse in the region. Its stability is crucial to combating the growing risk of Islamist terrorists, who thrive on instability. As Boko Haram seeks to extend its tentacles with its recent pledge of allegiance to ISIS, Nigeria has teamed up with neighboring Chad and Cameroon in a counteroffensive against  the terror group. And it appears  to be working, with its military  saying it has recaptured several key cities from the militants. The next leader will have to ensure the gains stay on track. As we have learned with ISIS in Iraq and Syria, any unaddressed local insurgency has the potential to spiral into an international problem. And let's face it, the world does not need another failing state, especially one with such a massive population. Nigeria is also one of Africa's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States. It hosts many international oil companies and workers. The key issues are power, security and the economy. But with the rise of Boko Haram, security has taken center stage. Just this year alone, the extremists have killed at least 1,000 civilians, Human Rights Watch says. One of the militants' most brutal acts was the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls last April, a majority of whom are still missing. Boko Haram has become increasingly brazen, seizing towns in bloody attacks and declaring them Islamic caliphates. Militants have bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. Although the current government is ""having successes here and there"" in its fight against Boko Haram, it's not winning the war against  the terror group, says Ayo Johnson, a documentary filmmaker and analyst on African affairs. And despite recapturing some key towns from militants, he says, the government's big picture on security is still hazy. ""This elections will come down to who can protect Nigeria,"" Johnson says. ""Who can make Nigerians feel safe."" Nigeria overtook South Africa as the region's largest economy last year. The government has made tremendous gains on the economy, Johnson says, but those gains have  been buried under the constant threat of Boko Haram. But many complain that the country's vast wealth from oil exports does not trickle down to the average citizen. As many as 70% of Nigerians live below the poverty line and survive on less than a dollar a day, according to the CIA World Factbook. Nigeria is under economic pressure because of falling crude oil prices worldwide and a weakened currency. Corruption has been a hindrance to building a stable economy despite years of democracy, analysts say. There are 14 candidates on the ballot, but the race is more of a rematch between the current president and a former military ruler. The two faced off in the last election in 2011. President Goodluck Jonathan: . Jonathan rode a wave of popularity in 2011. At the time, he portrayed himself as a man of the people. During campaigns, he talked about growing up without shoes,  a message that resonated with average Nigerians. But in recent years, his popularity has plummeted, with Nigerians saying he has not delivered on his promises for change. Key officials have defected from his ruling People's Democratic Party to the newly formed All Progressives Congress. Muhammadu Buhari: . The retired general has unsuccessfully run for election three times. Buhari ruled Nigeria in the 1980s following a military coup and was known for his tough regime, which some say was marked by human rights abuses. But he has pledged to make fighting graft and insecurity a priority if he wins, which might appeal to those who've run out of patience with the current government. His military rule background could be a plus or a minus. ""Many Nigerians will not forget he was a military leader, during a dictatorship,"" Johnson says. ""Or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism."" The election was originally scheduled for February 14, but was delayed for six weeks. In addition to the presidential elections, Nigerians will elect  governors in 36 states. Like their U.S. counterparts, the nation's governors have a lot of clout. Not only do they set priorities for federal funds, they are also responsible for security in their states and are thus the first line of defense against extremists, especially in the North, where militants have free rein. In populated cities such as Lagos, governors manage economies larger than those of some African countries. To avoid a runoff,  a candidate must get more than 50% of the vote and at least a quarter in two-thirds of the states. If no candidate wins, a runoff election will be held seven days later. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","The election was delayed for six weeks .

"(CNN)Robert Downey Jr. may be Iron Man in the popular Marvel superhero films, but he recently dealt in some advanced bionic technology himself. Downey recently presented a robotic arm to young Alex Pring, a Central Florida boy who is missing his right arm from just above his elbow. The arm was made by Limbitless Solutions, a volunteer group started by Albert Manero, a University of Central Florida engineering PhD student, to make free bionic arms for kids. Through 3-D printing technology, Alex and others have had the chance to get a robotic arm so they can use their limbs again. Alex received his robotic arm in the summer, then later had it upgraded to resemble a ""Transformers"" arm. This past Saturday, Alex received an even more impressive gift, from ""Tony Stark"" himself. Downey met with Alex in an Atlanta hotel room. The actor showed the child two arms, one from Downey's movies and one for Alex: a real, working robotic Iron Man arm. As they both tried theirs on, they compared the lights inside their palms. The video was posted Thursday by Downey as well as Microsoft, which arranged the meeting as part of its social media campaign, The Collective Project, celebrating students using technology to change the world. It very quickly went viral on social media. Alex is 7, in first grade and a huge superhero fan. His mom told him they were going to Atlanta to meet Manero and a specialist who were working on a new arm for the boy. ""He didn't question it much, so we kind of just went with it,"" his mom, Alyson Pring, told CNN. ""Afterward, I asked, 'Why were you so quiet?' He said, 'I was freaking out!' "" After giving him the new arm, Downey invited Alex to hang out with him in Atlanta this summer when he's filming the new Captain America movie. Manero met Alex through E-Nable, a volunteer network that matches people who have 3-D printers with children who need limbs. Alex's mom wanted to get him a replacement hand because he was being teased. ""Whenever people saw him, they'd say, 'What's wrong with your arm?' "" Alyson Pring said. ""Now it's, 'Your arm is amazing, you're so cool ... it helps educate people to maybe think twice before saying something like, 'Why are you like that'?"" The prop master for the Marvel movies built the case for Downey Jr.'s arm and the case for the little boy's arm. The college students made the actual arm for Pring, from the design to the painting to the robotics, said David Beauparlant, marketing manager at Microsoft. ""You couldn't even do this stuff not too long ago. It's amazing what the 3-D printing can do,"" he said.

"(CNN)Angelina Jolie took the stage Saturday at Nickelodeon's 28th Annual Kids' Choice Awards and delivered a message of hope to anyone who's ever felt out of place. In her first public appearance since revealing that she underwent a second preventive surgery to lower her risk of cancer, Jolie attended the show with her children, Shiloh and Zahara. She hugged them before she went to the stage to accept the favorite villain award for her role as Maleficent in the live-action reimagining of ""Sleeping Beauty."" ""When I was little, like Maleficent, I was told that I was different.  And I felt out of place -- too loud, too full of fire, never good at sitting still, never good at fitting in,"" the 39-year-old actor and humanitarian said. ""And, then one day I realized something, something that I hope you all realize: Different is good,"" she said, prompting enthusiastic screams from the young crowd. ""And, as your villain, I would also say cause a little trouble -- it's good for you."" Jolie's career has been full of unconventional twists and turns, from her breakthrough role in the biopic ""Gia"" to her current role as an actor, filmmaker and special envoy of the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Refugees. Her personal life also has made front page headlines over the years, including her adoption of children from developing countries and her candor in discussing her health. Jolie, 39, wrote Tuesday in a New York Times essay that she had opted for the surgery after blood tests revealed markers that might have been an indication of early cancer. Two years ago, she underwent a double mastectomy for similar reasons. Jolie's mother died of ovarian cancer, and the actress has a gene mutation that makes her chances of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer much higher than the overall population. Jolie's revelation provoked an outpouring of support as the news spread across social media. ""It is not easy to make these decisions. But it is possible to take control and tackle head-on any health issue. You can seek advice, learn about the options and make choices that are right for you.

"(CNN)I'm Candida Moss, and I am professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame. I was an adviser on the ""True Cross"" episode and served as one of the many on-camera experts in CNN's ""Finding Jesus"" series, which airs on Sundays. Viewers were invited during the show to tweet and post their questions on the ""Finding Jesus"" Facebook page. Below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them. They have been edited for style and clarity for this article. What's ""true"" about the cross that killed Jesus? Lynn Santos: Where might there be other pieces of the ""true cross""? Is anyone attempting to carbon date these relics ? Moss: There are churches all over the world that claim to have fragments or splinters of the true cross. These aren't being carbon dated and there are a few reasons why. First, carbon dating is expensive, and your average church doesn't have the funds for this kind of endeavor. Second, carbon dating is seen as intrusive and a little destructive. Even if only about 10 milligrams of wood are needed, you're still chipping away at a holy object. This isn't something that churches like to do, especially as -- and this leads me to my third point -- almost all carbon dating tests end up discrediting the relics that are being tested. So, it's not in the best interest of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches that claim to possess relics to have them tested. Matt Marino: Are you able to tell what type of wood the cross was built from? Moss: Unless we know with complete certainty that we have a fragment of the true cross, then we won't be able to assert what kind of wood was used. Nonetheless, we can make some best guesses. A number of scholars have thought that the cross was made of cedar because cedar is a sturdy wood found in the region. There is also evidence from the crucifixion of other criminals. In 1968, the remains of a crucified man named Yehohanan ben Hagkol were found during excavations in northern Jerusalem. We know he was crucified because there was a spike embedded in his ankle bone. The Department of Botany at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem concluded that the wood underneath the nail was olive wood. So perhaps that's a possibility. Daniel Pronych: How can we be certain the Romans didn't reuse Jesus' cross? Moss:  This is a great question. Hewn wood and nails were more valuable in the ancient world than they are today. There are examples of the Romans discarding tools and other implements (for instance after the battle of Masada, when they left behind pottery vessels rather than haul them away), but this usually took place in situations where carrying these tools was more effort than it was worth. The Romans were efficient and would likely have reused the instruments of torture if they could. The Jewish historian Josephus tells us that wood was scarce around Jerusalem in the first century A.D. and that the Romans had to travel 10 miles to secure timber for the siege of Jerusalem (Jewish War 5.522-23). Josephus was writing about a period of war some 40 years later but, all the same, we can imagine that the Romans wanted to conserve the wood that they had. In other words, you're absolutely right: We can't be sure the cross upon which Jesus was crucified wasn't reused in the execution of other criminals or in some other kind of construction. How well do you know the life of Jesus? Take the quiz. James Faubel: If the crucifixion of Christ was so important to Christians, why are there no images of Christ on the cross in Christian art until about the seventh century A.D.? Prior to that time, the depictions are usually of a lamb on the cross. Moss: It is certainly true that early on (first-third century) Christians did not use the image of the cross in their art. This in part seems to have been because crucifixion was so shameful and humiliating. Depicting a cross would be akin to using an image of an electric chair or a hangman's noose. So, early on, Christians used images of Daniel in the lion's den, Jonah and the whale and the three young men in the fiery furnace in the funeral art as symbols of resurrection and conquest of death. Beginning in the fourth century, things began to change. Constantine's vision was really instrumental in this process. The cross began to be retrieved as a symbol of power, so that instead of being a symbol of shameful death it became an emblem of victory over death. There are a lot of really interesting studies of the emergence of the cross in early Christian art; I'd recommend Robin Jensen's ""Understanding Early Christian Art"" as a great place to start.",Religion professor Candida Moss appears in each episode of the program .

"(CNN)I am atheist -- and I am black. Yes, we exist -- even if many in the media sometimes don't notice us. In a CNN special that aired on Tuesday, for example, people of color were not as well-represented as American atheism's more familiar face: You know, white males. In fact, African-American atheists represent a still small -- though growing -- segment of American atheists at large. Does this mean that blacks and other minorities generally just don't gravitate towards nonbelief, or are there other factors which keep us hidden? There is a harsh truth to face here. Most blacks identify as religious. Belief in God is touted with pride, and the church is intricately tied to tradition, history and culture. It is not uncommon to assume that I attend services as a black woman. The question often isn't if I go to church -- it's where. And even if one doesn't go to church, surely they still have faith -- because our people have endured and overcome so much hardship that it had to be the work of a god. All of this makes the words ""black"" and ""atheist"" hard for many to imagine in the same sentence. It can be extremely difficult to discuss religion objectively in the black community. Many have social, emotional and financial stakes invested in this institution, so for one to even say they have doubts is like committing treason. To openly identify as an atheist in the midst of heavy religious influence can be next to impossible, and good luck finding other blacks who also don't believe. It is very important to note however, that the Internet has made it easier for black atheists to find each other, and there is a large community of us online. Though I was raised secular -- a rarity in my community -- I've had to endure ostracism from family and friends as a result of openly identifying as an atheist. However, my journey is far from tragic. In founding my organization, Black Nonbelievers, in 2011, I have been fortunate to connect with others who were either raised secular like myself, or who were brought up extremely religious and left it behind. And they have done so bravely, defying the perception and expectation that all blacks blindly accept religion. The Friendly Atheists Next Door . My experience in the secular community as a black atheist has ranged from feeling totally welcome to feeling totally isolated, and even ignored. On the one hand, there is common ground shared -- our nonbelief and even discontent with religion unites us. On the other hand, there is a notion that since we share this common ground that there are no other issues to address. The lack of people of color at secular events is a problem -- partly because there is unawareness of such events existing, but also because there is limited effort placed in accommodation and care. We are sometimes treated as if we are invisible, or even as an afterthought -- which does not make the few persons of color feel welcome. Fortunately, all is not lost. Progress has been made. There are now a number of secular groups that have helped to bring about more diverse representation for people of color, women and children. There is a more concentrated focus on support for the LGBT demographic, as well for others who come from marginalized and disfranchised backgrounds. There are support systems for people who have lost loved ones, yet they have no religious affiliation. Moreover, there is a tremendous amount of literary and artistic talent. Such representation is now reflected at organized events, in leadership, as well as in media coverage. While the number of visible minority atheists is still small, we are here and we're here to stay. We will continue to grow, in both the black and secular communities. We can lead the charge for this change. The more we make our presence known, the better our chances of working together to turn around the disparities we face, and bolster the recognition we so rightly deserve. We are not alone.","African-American atheists represent a small but growing segment of American atheists at large .

"(CNN)Four years. At least 220,000 people killed -- more than one every 10 minutes. Millions displaced. The Syrian civil war is a human calamity and it's getting worse, according to a furious new report from more than 20 aid groups. U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at protecting civilians caught up in the conflict have failed miserably, the humanitarian organizations say in the report released Thursday. ""This spiraling catastrophe is a stain on the conscience of the international community,"" says the report, whose signatories include Oxfam and Save the Children. ""We're worried that, as we approach the fourth anniversary, this could turn into a situation of acceptance -- 'Oh, that's just the way it is over there' -- and that mustn't be,"" Nigel Timmins, deputy director for Oxfam Great Britain, told CNN. It highlights the paltry results of a Security Council resolution passed in February 2014 that called for an increase in humanitarian aid, a halt to attacks on civilians, an end to kidnapping and torture and the lifting of sieges of populated areas. ""In the 12 months since Resolution 2139 was passed, civilians in Syria have witnessed ever-increasing destruction, suffering and death,"" the report says. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, has reported that 2014 was the deadliest year so far in the grinding conflict that began in March 2011 as an uprising against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and splintered into a chaotic civil war. More than 76,000 people were killed in the violence in Syria last year, nearly 18,000 of them civilians, according to the observatory. The conflict has brought allegations of atrocities carried out by al-Assad's forces and enabled ISIS' savage rule over parts of the country. Attempts at peace talks involving the government and opposition have so far gone nowhere. As the war threatens to sow further chaos in the region, the United States and its allies are bombing ISIS targets in Syria and working to arm and train rebel groups. The aid groups' report, entitled ""Failing Syria,"" reeled off a list of worsening problems reported by international agencies: . The report called on Security Council members to ""use their influence with the warring parties and their financial resources to put an end to the suffering of Syrian civilians."" In Washington, a group of Syrian Americans and other supporters gathered near the White House on Wednesday to mark the four years of bloodshed and read the names of 100,000 people who were killed in the violence. A U.N. aid official told CNN of the crisis unfolding at one particular refugee camp in Syria that he had just visited. ""What I saw yesterday really shattered and devastated me,"" said Pierre Krahenbuhl, the head of of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees who has been working in conflict zones for 20 years. Around 18,000 Palestinian refugees in the Yarmouk camp are in ""dire"" need of food and health aid, he said Wednesday, describing seeing enfeebled men and a fainting pregnant woman waiting for assistance. The ongoing conflict is adding to the plight of the camp's inhabitants. ""You have inside the camp a number of armed groups and of course you then have government armed forces around it,"" Krahenbuhl said.

Ignoring the usual five minutes or so of monologue jokes, Corden launched right into a star-studded pre-taped bit that showed how he got the job of host: by picking up one of CBS president Les Moonves' Willy Wonka-esque golden ticket dropped by Chelsea Handler (a joke referencing rumors that she was in talks for the job Corden won).

"(CNN)The fiancée of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez said at a hearing Friday that she was asked to conceal a box and take it out of her Massachusetts home after the murder of Odin Lloyd in 2013. Shayanna Jenkins' testimony came outside the presence of the jury during a hearing on the limits of her testimony. But it signaled where the prosecution intends to take its questioning of the key witness, who took the stand before the jury later Friday. She is testifying after being granted immunity. Hernandez, the ex-tight end who had a $40 million contract until he was charged with murder, has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, a semi-pro football player. He has also pleaded not guilty to other weapons charges. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. ""You took that box out and concealed it. Were you attempting to do it in a way so that people didn't know what you were doing?"" Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley asked. ""That's correct,"" Jenkins said. The weapon in the case has not been recovered. The prosecution has said Hernandez's high school sweetheart removed the weapon from their North Attleboro home after Lloyd was killed on June 17, 2013. The state also alleges that she lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in the home. She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty. Jenkins testified she was ""instructed"" to take the box out of the home, and that it was ""important"" for her to get rid of it. On the day after Lloyd's killing, prosecutors have said Jenkins received a coded text message from Hernandez. Search warrants said Hernandez asked his fiancée to remove something from their basement. The text message said: ""Go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box ... jus (sic) in case u were looking for it!!! Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv ... WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL....K"" Asked about the text message Friday afternoon, in the presence of the jury, Jenkins said she didn't know what it meant. Jenkins also told the jury that she met her fiance's two alleged accomplices in the killing of Lloyd and gave them $500 in cash as police were questioning Hernandez about the slaying. Jenkins testified that she took Hernandez to a police station on June 18, 2013, and that he asked her to give Wallace money. Wallace was comforting to her, Jenkins told the jury. ""He said everything would be OK,"" she said. She went to a bank ATM and withdrew $500 to give Wallace. ""I don't remember the dollar amount he asked for but I remember telling him that was the amount I could take out,"" she testified. Hours after Lloyd's death, Jenkins said, Hernandez appeared ""normal"" and his two alleged accomplices appeared ""fine."" Jenkins, 25, and Hernandez are the parents of a daughter who was just a year old when her father was arrested on June 26, 2013. Her sister Shaneah was dating Lloyd, 27, who was shot six times, according to prosecutors. At one point, McCauley asked Jenkins if she ever saw guns in the home. She told the jury that she saw one ""in the kitchen junk drawer."" Prosecution witnesses have testified that Lloyd was shot to death with a .45-caliber Glock handgun. McCauley approached Jenkins on the stand with a Glock similar to the one used in the murder. ""Is that a secured firearm?"" she asked, moving back slightly. ""Yes."" McCauley asked if the Glock's shape was similar to the one she saw in the junk drawer. ""Yes,"" she responded. ""Color?"" ""Yes."" Size? ""I'm not sure,"" she told the jury.

""This is very current, very well done, and pretty dramatic findings, let's be honest,"" said Dr. Pierre Tariot, director of Banner's Alzheimer's Institute. ""I am reminded of the rather sobering fact that as many as 60% of people who have a dementia die without the dementia having been diagnosed by their doctor."" Why the silence? This is not the first report to show doctors are sidestepping this tough conversation. But why? That's been studied too, and the reasons doctors give range from diagnostic uncertainty and fear of causing emotional distress to time constraints, lack of support, and stigma. ""There is an element of stigma here towards brain and mental health problems in general,"" said Tariot. ""I would call it professional awkwardness. I can't really help this condition, why invest time and energy talking about it, it makes me squirm."" ""I think the comparison of Alzheimer's to cancer is appropriate,"" said Dr. Tom Price, Medical Director for Emory University's Geriatric Clinic. ""I give patients a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease many times a week, and every time it is uncomfortable, and I've been doing it for over 10 years. It is easier to talk about cancer now that there are so many new and effective treatment strategies, and cause of optimism with survival from cancer at an all-time high."" What's at stake . Alzheimer's advocates stress the importance of giving a patient all the facts, as early as possible, so they can work with their family to organize legal and health directives and have time to fulfill life-long desires. It's just as important for the caregiver. ""Imagine it's your spouse,"" said Tariot. ""Personality changes, memory is different, language and communication is different, you don't know what is going on. Then you start getting answers, and you get a sense of how to play to his strengths and minimize his weaknesses. Here are travel tips, communication tips, and safety issues; here are ways to stay happy and joyful, even though this is a new chronic illness."" There's another critical factor as well: access to clinical trials that might help slow the illness. ""Right now, the big studies that are underway in prevention are really looking at people in the early stages of Alzheimer's,"" said Kallmyer. ""So by waiting, they can lose out on clinical trials as well."" Addressing the 'gap' ""We want to be clear that we believe physicians are well meaning, but there's a gap there somewhere,"" said Keith Fargo, Director of Scientific Programs for the Alzheimer's Association. ""We saw doctors say lack of time, lack of resources, so we think the answer to this mostly has to do with education and providing more resources."" Experts CNN spoke to agreed. ""As a field, we have failed,"" Tariot told CNN. ""It isn't just the doctors in the trenches. Medical schools, professional organizations and health care systems have not recognized the importance of identification and management of people with dementia."" ""I think that medical school curriculum does need to update to include neurodegenerative diseases in their 'giving bad news' training -- Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, for example,"" said Price. ""We do need to educate all providers to be aware that hesitance to give the diagnosis reduces the ability of the patient and family to make some choices and planning that is essential for emotional and financial well-being.""","Only 45% of patients and their caregivers say their doctor told them they have Alzheimer's .
Yet more than 90% of common cancer patients were given their diagnosis .
Advocates say truthful diagnosis is critical to quality of life and future planning ."
"(CNN)Utah's governor signed a bill Monday that brings back firing squads as a potential way to execute some death row prisoners. Lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in the state, Gov. Gary R. Herbert said in a statement. A firing squad would only be used in the event the necessary drugs cannot be obtained. ""Those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state,"" said Marty Carpenter, a spokesman for Herbert. ""We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued. However, when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant, enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch,"" he said. Utah banned death by firing squad in 2004, though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death. The last execution by firing squad was in 2010, and it was also the most recent execution in Utah. A Utah firing squad also executed Gary Gilmore in 1977, the first death by capital punishment after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty the prior year. CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.","Firing squads will be allowed in Utah if drugs for lethal injection can't be obtained .

"(CNN)Ferguson's municipal judge has resigned and the city's court cases are getting moved after the U.S. Justice Department said the court discriminated against African-Americans. ""To help restore public trust and confidence in the Ferguson municipal court division, the Supreme Court of Missouri today transferred Judge Roy L. Richter of the Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District, to the St. Louis County Circuit Court, where he will be assigned to hear all of Ferguson's pending and future municipal division cases,"" the Supreme Court said in a statement Monday. ""Extraordinary action is warranted in Ferguson, but the court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis,"" Chief Justice Mary R. Russell said in the statement. The announcement came the same day Municipal Court Judge Ronald Brockmeyer resigned as Ferguson's judge. ""Mr. Brockmeyer recognizes that the Department of Justice report, as well as recent media reports, regardless of their accuracy or validity, have diminished the public's confidence in the Ferguson Municipal Court,"" his attorney Bert Fulk said in a statement. ""Mr. Brockmeyer believes that it is paramount to begin immediately on promoting the public's confidence in the Ferguson Municipal Court. Promoting the public confidence in the Ferguson Municipal Court will help Ferguson begin its healing process."" The Justice Department's report said Brockmeyer approved the creation of additional fees, ""many of which are widely considered abusive and may be unlawful, including several that the City has repealed during the pendency of our investigation. These include a $50 fee charged each time a person has a pending municipal arrest warrant cleared."" Just about every branch of Ferguson government -- police, Municipal Court, City Hall -- participated in ""unlawful"" targeting of African-American residents for tickets and fines, the Justice Department concluded. The millions of dollars in fines and fees paid by black residents served an ultimate goal of satisfying ""revenue rather than public safety needs,"" the Justice Department found. Document: Justice report finds systematic discrimination by police in Ferguson . Its report detailed how Ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration to city council -- to raise revenue for the city budget through increased ticketing and fining. The investigators also found evidence of racist jokes being sent around by Ferguson police and court officials. One November 2008 email said President Barack Obama wouldn't likely be President for long because ""what black man holds a steady job for four years."" Another email joked that African-American women should use abortion to control crime. ""Our investigation has not revealed any indication that any officer or court clerk engaged in these communications was ever disciplined,"" the Justice Department's report said. The DOJ's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, who was shot by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in August. Wilson, who was not indicted on any charges, has resigned from the police department. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Ronald Brockmeyer resigns as Ferguson's Municipal Court judge .

"(CNN)In the final days of the Israeli election campaign, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disavowed the two-state solution and said there would be no Palestinian state on his watch. He also earned universal condemnation for his panicked warning to his followers on election day that Arabs were ""voting in droves"" -- a comment that will resound to his shame and can neither be forgiven nor forgotten unless he apologizes clearly, sincerely and without reservation. And now, facing international uproar and a stern U.S. response, Israeli officials have started backing away from these statements. The Israeli ambassador to Canada, Rafael Barak, said Wednesday on CBC TV, ""This is an election campaign and you have to take with a grain of salt what was said at the last minute when the polls say you are going to lose."" Netanyahu himself, in an interview on NBC, tried to qualify his words about a two-state solution, saying what he meant to say was that a Palestinian state was not viable under present conditions. He knows that stance is totally unacceptable to Israel's chief ally, the United States, and to the rest of the international community. And he should not be allowed to slip off the hook so easily. Indeed, far from taking this statement with a grain of salt, the world is likely to look back at his previously stated support for a two-state solution and take that with more than a grain of salt. The fact is, rhetorical if not actual support for a two-state solution has served Netanyahu well for the past several years, and has provided him with a convenient shield against international pressure to end the almost 48-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Also helping Netanyahu was the presence in his Cabinet of Israeli politicians who actually do believe in a two-state solution and worked hard to make it happen -- notably former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, who headed up the failed 2014 negotiations with the Palestinians. Livni wanted to move forward in the talks, but found herself hemmed in and frustrated by Netanyahu's aides -- and apparently by the prime minister himself -- at every turn. Now, as he constructs a coalition of ultranationalists and ultra-Orthodox, those shields have been stripped away. Netanyahu must now face the world having bared his true face and exposed his true beliefs -- and the international community, led by the United States, must respond accordingly. What should this involve? To begin with, Washington should not wait for others to draft a U.N. resolution condemning the settlements. It should take the initiative, in consultation with its international partners, in drafting a resolution that lays out the detailed parameters for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution should of course state unequivocally that the solution rests in an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines, with equivalent land swaps to incorporate some of the major settlement blocs within Israel. It should also reiterate Israel's right to security. And it should state clearly and unambiguously that the settlements are illegal under international law and must stop. Words are important -- but more important are deeds. Whatever he says about the two-state solution, the next Netanyahu government is virtually certain to blast ahead with settlement-building. It is on that basis that he and his administration should be diplomatically isolated and condemned. In his campaign statement, Netanyahu took pride in approving the construction of a huge suburb on the southern fringes of Jerusalem in order to block Palestinian construction from neighboring Bethlehem. He boasted that the building was not simply to provide housing for Jews rather than Palestinians, but that it was to make it harder for the Palestinians to establish a coherent, territorially contiguous state. Netanyahu's statement was a moment of truth for him, for Israel and for the world. He was admirably blunt and concise. He left no doubt what he intended. Now, the world must hold him to account.","Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed idea of Palestinian state during campaign .

"(CNN)Europe is in the midst of a political and economic crisis that threatens to unravel decades of European integration and derail the world's recovery from the great recession. To understand this crisis, let's compare two countries. Country A is a small nation with a long history of tax evasion, government debt defaults and a dysfunctional business and regulatory climate. It allows workers to retire in their 50s, and pays double pensions when they do. It lied about its budget to get into the eurozone. Country B is a large, historically powerful nation with a record of low government debt. Country B even ran budget surpluses, including a 2% surplus just before the financial crisis hit in 2008.  It entered the eurozone with an honest accounting of its finances. If you guessed that country A is Greece, you are correct.  If you believe Greece has caused the crisis in Europe because of its fiscal irresponsibility, then you are safely in the mainstream opinion about the matter. But what do we make of fiscally responsible country B?  Its virtuousness must mean it is weathering the crisis. And it must be Germany, right? Wrong. Country B is not Germany. Country B is Spain. Far from prospering, Spain is doing terribly. Spain's unemployment rate is 23.7%, down from a high of almost 27% in 2013.  More than a fifth of its workers have been jobless for the last four years. More than half of its young people are out of work and have been for years. There is regularly talk of a lost generation in Spain and Greece. Like Greece, Spain's investment bubble burst when the financial crisis hit and it had to seek a bailout (although a much smaller one) to prevent its domestic banks from collapsing. Spain's economy also shrank during the crisis and its debt to GDP ratio has shot up dramatically. If Greece and Spain have such wildly different approaches to fiscal prudence, what can explain the crisis they both find themselves in? The answer is not fiscal virtue. Something else is going on. That something else, in large part, is the euro. Joining the eurozone meant Spain and Greece gave up the power to create money, the power to devalue their currency to restore competitiveness, and the power to set interest rates. These are not trivial concessions, especially in a currency union like the euro where transfers between rich and poor sectors of the economy are limited, strict budget rules deny individual countries the flexibility to react to a crisis, and trade between euro-area nations is severely imbalanced. The inability to set interest rates in line with the economic conditions meant that in the early 2000s, Spain and Greece couldn't raise interest rates to cool their over-heating economies. The over-heating was largely caused, by the way, by the frenzied (and ultimately reckless) lending in both countries by German and other core European banks. The European Central Bank set interest rates in line with economic conditions in Germany and France that proved too low for Spain and Greece (and Ireland). Read: 25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis . The over-heating of the Greek and Spanish economies led to inflation and investment bubbles. As those bubbles burst, the banks neared collapse, and their rescue led ultimately to a sovereign debt crisis. The inability of Spain and Greece to print money meant they had to borrow from their partners in Europe or default and be ignominiously tossed out of the EU. Strict budget rules of Eurozone membership also required Spain and Greece to impose austerity measures in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. They were required to raise taxes and cut spending even as unemployment reached astronomical levels. Austerity helped create a depression of historic magnitude in Greece and a severe recession in Spain. The policies also created runaway public debt. Greece's debt is now 175% of GDP. Spain's debt to GDP ratio is 100% -- a level not seen in Spain in more than 100 years. Because Spain and Greece cannot devalue the euro, the only way they can become competitive is through internal devaluation. This means Greece and Spain are in for years of high unemployment, reduced living standards, falling wages and deflation. In other words, massive impoverization. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, famously said: ""The euro is forever."" That may or may not be so, but it doesn't mean that countries like Greece and Spain should stay in the euro forever. Contrary to popular opinion, this crisis cannot be explained away with a moral tale of Greek fiscal irresponsibility. The facts suggest otherwise.","If Greece and Spain have such different approaches to fiscal prudence, Lisa Tripp asks why both are in crisis?
Something else is going on, she says: That something else, in large part, is the euro ."
"(CNN)Hillary Clinton's lawyerly news conference Tuesday, at which she doggedly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server to conduct official State Department business was improper, might extinguish the matter for most Americans -- but it doesn't get Clinton out of the woods politically. The real possibility of lasting political damage to the former secretary of state will come if her emails reveal any favoritism to any of the foreign donors who contributed to the welter of powerful charitable organizations housed at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This is the multibillion-dollar foundation Hillary Clinton leads alongside ex-President Bill Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea. What we already know about the foundation's donors is controversial: Some of the corporations, banks and foreign governments that have funded foundation projects have abysmal human rights records and have been involved in everything from drug money laundering to aiding terrorism in violation of American law. The Clintons can make a plausible case that it's best to solicit money from companies and foreign governments -- even ethically challenged ones -- and put it to good use attacking problems of global poverty. As Bill Clinton recently told reporters: ""You've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country."" It's an interesting and important debate, and most Americans would probably approve the idea of putting ""bad"" money to good use.  But the argument only works if Clinton's work as secretary of state was completely separate from the foundation's tip-toeing around ethical challenges. To figure that out requires analyzing the history of what began as the William J. Clinton Foundation shortly after he left office in 2001.  Different initiatives were added over the years to combat AIDS, climate change, poverty and other ills; the most high-profile of these projects, the Clinton Global Initiative, added in 2005, brings world leaders together to tackle the world's problems. To make things even more complicated, the foundation's website says its mission is supported by the Clinton Presidential Center in Arkansas, which includes an archive of the President's papers. The foundation recently co-sponsored a Black History month event with the center. The foundation's thicket of relationships with corporate donors and foreign heads of states is difficult for outsiders to penetrate and understand. And with 350 employees spread across 180 nations, running the foundation is an expensive proposition: in 2012, the various initiatives spent $214 million according to The New York Times but still ended up $8 million in the red. Who gave, and why, is hard to figure out. According to The Wall Street Journal, ""The Clinton Foundation does disclose its donors, which isn't required by law. But the disclosure is limited; dates and exact amount of the donations aren't disclosed. Donations are listed in value ranges and updated annually with only the previous year's donor getting an asterisk by his or her name."" Hillary and Bill Clinton have put some safeguards in place to put distance between her job as secretary of state and the inner workings of the foundation. During Hillary Clinton's years as secretary of state, the high-profile Clinton Global Initiative split off from the larger Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton says he had no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. Hillary Clinton also stayed away from the foundation during her time at the State Department and agreed to subject possible conflicts to the department's ethics office. It was only after she resigned that she formally joined the foundation and added her name to its title. Ideally that would settle the matter, but there's the possibility that the elaborate formal safeguards may have been breached or ignored. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that ""at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during her tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation,"" raising questions about whether the firms were using the donations to curry favor with the secretary of state. In one well-publicized case, Hillary pressed a state-owed Russian airline to buy American planes from Boeing. The effort worked: Boeing ended up with a $3.7 billion contract. (To be sure, secretaries of state are always lobbying foreign countries to purchase American products. It's part of their job.) But weeks after Clinton's persuasion (what she called a ""shameless pitch""), Boeing donated $900,000 to the foundation. A CNN investigation by Alexandra Jaffe recently showed that half a dozen banks that gave money to the Clinton Foundation were involved in ethically questionable behavior and might have used donations to the foundation and/or its CGI spinoff as a way to gain favor with the Clintons and enhance their tarnished reputations. In 2012, the British bank Standard Chartered paid $667 million in fines for violating sanctions against Iran and HSBC paid $1.92 billion to settle claims of illegally doing business for customers in Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Myanmar and allowing drug dealers to launder money through the bank. Both banks have been major contributors to the foundation. As Jaffe notes, ""the fact that the foundation partnered with banks that were actively under investigation raises questions over what restrictions, if any, the foundation placed on its fundraising operation."" And according to The Washington Post, seven nations donated millions to the foundation during Clinton's time as secretary of state, including a $500,000 gift from Algeria that the foundation failed to clear in advance through the State Department's ethics office. That sort of corner-cutting, and the cozy-seeming connections between Clinton and various corporations and governments, will be tough to explain on the campaign trail. If emails suggest Clinton was aware of the corporations, banks and nations sending money to her foundation during her time at the State Department -- or worse, took action to help encourage the flow of donations -- the issue would almost certainly derail her likely presidential campaign. It's much too early to count Hillary out, of course. The Clintons can credibly argue that the money they collected has funded more than a billion dollars' worth of good works, from lowering the price of HIV-fighting drugs in developing countries to advancing green technology and educating girls and women. But there's no scenario in which voters can be expected to ignore or support the former secretary of state if she is shown to have been simultaneously arranging pay-to-play deals with businesses and governments seeking help or favors from the U.S. government while she was in office. What will matter is not why or how Hillary stored her emails but whether the actual emails show her in ethical quicksand from which no presidential candidate can escape.","Errol Louis: Bigger question than kind of email used is whether Hillary Clinton's emails show favoritism for donors .
He says some corporations and foreign nation donors stained by sanctions for illegal behavior .

"(CNN)A previously unknown species of catfish has been named for the wide-eyed, puckered-mouth ""Star Wars"" character it resembles. Its scientific name is Peckoltia greedoi, and it is known for its large, dark eyes, puckered lips and protruding bristles. But you can call him Greedo, in honor of the bounty hunter from ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope."" You might remember him from the cantina scene on Mos Eisley, where he was killed by Han Solo while attempting to collect on a debt for Jabba the Hutt. ""I think it was the whole package that evoked Greedo, but particularly the eyes and the underslung mouth,"" said Jonathan Armbruster, biological sciences professor and curator of fishes at the Auburn University Museum of Natural History. Armbruster made the connection in September with colleagues David Werneke, Milton Tan and Chris Hamilton. But, like many things in academia, it took a while to make it official. The specimens were found in 1998 by researchers along the Gurupi River in Brazil. Armbruster obtained them in 2005 from a museum in Porto Alegre for a manuscript he was preparing on the genus, ""thinking they were unusual."" He designated them as another existing species, Peckoltia vittata, in a 2008 paper, ""although I had not been comfortable with that designation."" He examined them again in September and discovered they were different from Peckoltia vittata. After talking it over with his colleagues, they realized he was a clear ringer for Greedo. ""As a 7-year-old kid, I watched ""Star Wars"" in the theater, and it was a life-changing experience for me,"" said Armbruster. ""I became a lifelong fan, and I now share that with my son. Greedo has always been a personal favorite of mine."" Greedo became the object of controversy when Lucasfilm re-released the original Star Wars trilogy in 1997. A reworked scene showed Greedo firing a shot at Solo before Solo fired back. In the 1977 release, Han is the only one to fire, prompting backlash from fans and giving rise to the phrase ""Han Shot First.""","Catfish with large, dark eyes and puckered lips named after bounty hunter Greedo .

"(CNN)Every year, animal handlers travel throughout England and Wales to compete at agricultural shows. Jooney Woodward's ""Best in Show"" is a documentation of those competitions, with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals. ""When you go to (the shows), they tend to be all about the animals -- people photographing the animals,"" Woodward said. ""I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they're so committed to what they do. They're really devoted and hardworking."" While those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers, Woodward's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style. ""My work is a bit more composed. I use a medium-format camera and a tripod, so it is a bit more static in a way,"" she said. ""I think everybody is so proud of their animals that when I said to them that, 'I'd love a portrait of you and your cow,' everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they're so passionate about what they do."" The ""Best in Show"" portraits lead viewers down a winding pathway to ponder those inexplicable yet noticeable connections and bonds that exist between the handlers and their animals. Woodward's photos also contain subtle details. For example, the symbols and signs on the wall behind Wendy and her Hereford yearling heifer Mandalay Juliette are just as significant as the handler and her animal. ""It's just the way (Wendy) had gone through the effort of decorating the pen (with Union Jacks) where the cows were being kept,"" Woodward said. ""There's also a sign behind (her) ... and there's a picture of a gentleman with a cow, who is actually her husband who had died a few years ago. ... I just thought that was nice, something quite sentimental about that."" There are not only sentimental subtleties within ""Best in Show,"" but also fun and interesting ones as well. This is especially evident in the photo of the traditional Welsh pigs being judged, as Woodward points out there is an advertisement for sausages behind the pigs. Regardless of what elements make up Woodward's photos, the emotions and aesthetics remain particularly important. Woodward said that when photographing Jamie and his Jersey cow, his happiness and smile made her want to ""share that sense of enjoyment"" that handlers have when competing with their animals in the shows. What drew Woodward to Harriet and her guinea pig Gentleman Jack were the similar colors radiating from both of them. Her photo of the pair won the National Portrait Gallery's Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize in 2011. ""(Harriet) was like a steward, she was sort of judging the guinea pigs. And she also had her own guinea pig with her, which had red as well,"" Woodward said. ""I just thought that was incredibly striking. I thought, 'I've got to get a shot of that.' "" The dynamics of the competitions foster a community atmosphere in which everybody becomes acquainted with one another after having traveled to different shows for so many years. Woodward said this was an enjoyable aspect of her work because ""you get to see lots of familiar faces."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. She has learned about the pride the handlers have toward their animals, and many of her presumptions about the competitions have now changed after having worked on ""Best in Show."" ""I think when I first started going, I was sort of thinking the shows would be more novelty, fun things for these people,"" she said. ""But, actually, it isn't really; it's quite a serious thing, because they can make money from breeding."" In addition to handlers earning significant money from breeding, they are also able to achieve recognition for their livestock. Those competing have a lot at stake when they make the decision to travel and compete, because the shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings. The competitions are also rather family-oriented, and Woodward said that while adults compete, their sons, daughters and grandchildren are involved as well. The younger generations are likely to one day take over the responsibility of running the family farms, and everyone that participates seems to have a strong sense of pride and passion for agriculture. ""I think it's something I will always document for the rest of my life, and see how things change,"" Woodward said. ""It was challenging, insightful and fun.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Pakistani Armed Forces paramilitary personal stormed the headquarters of one of the country's most powerful regional opposition political parties in a predawn raid on Wednesday, seizing a stash of weapons and arresting several wanted criminals, officials said. The Rangers arrived unannounced early Wednesday morning, arrested five men and sealed off the party's headquarter for four hours. According to a press release from the MQM (Muttahida Qaumi Movement) one of their party workers was shot fatally by rangers during the raid. ""All telephone lines have been disconnected and premises ransacked. Computers and other electronic items have been confiscated. The Rangers also destroyed the electronic surveillance system that had been set up following the May 2013 bomb attacks by the Pakistan Taliban (TTP),""  the release said. Rangers officials have not responded so far to these accusations. In a statement to the media, the Pakistan Rangers released a list of those arrested, including Faisal Mota, a former MQM worker who had been convicted and sentenced to death in absentia for the murder of journalist Wali Khan Babur.  Speaking to the media, Rangers spokesperson Col.Tahir Mahmood also confirmed that a large amount of illegal weapons had been seized during the raid. ""The weapons that we had were legal and there as a precautionary measure to deal with real threats from the Taliban against our party and its workers,"" Faisal Sabzwari, a senior MQM party leader told CNN. MQM is based in Karachi and is one of Pakistan's largest political parties. It has the second-largest contingent in the provincial assembly, with 54 of 130 seats. It styles itself as a voice for the downtrodden, the middle class and immigrants from nearby India, but political rivals accuse the party of using heavy-handed tactics, including intimidation, to stay in power. ""The raid is meant to send a clear message that law enforcement agencies and Rangers in particular are not going to bow to any political convention,"" said Zarrar Khuhro, a senior journalist and political analyst in Karachi. MQM's party leader Altaf Hussain, who has been living in self-imposed exile in London called for calm, but criticized the raid saying that ""it should not be the role of the armed forces to conduct extrajudicial operations on lawful organizations, least of all the headquarters of a democratically elected political party."" Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said late Wednesday night that the raid was legal. The MQM  has the clout to shut down the city in an hour, sparking general strikes which could last for days, locals say. In the aftermath, locals say businesses in Karachi have shut down, and gas pumps and schools are closed for fear violent protests could erupt in the streets.","Rangers arrested five men and sealed off the party's headquarter for hours .

"Beijing (CNN)In China, you can often tell what the Communist Party is thinking by watching TV. For years, the typical on-screen Chinese family looked something like this:  Glowing parents doting over one precious child. The taglines drummed it home: ""One hope."" ""One joy."" ""One responsibility."" Lately, the perfect television family has changed. In a recent commercial, a boy begrudgingly shares a toy with his younger sister, then they all gather together with a large brood to watch the televised Lunar New Year Gala. The message appears to be: Two is better than one. The change is extraordinary. Since the early 1980s, the Party has enforced a draconian one-child policy on most Chinese to curb population growth. When the propaganda didn't work, local officials have resorted to abortions, heavy fines, and forced sterilization. It's perhaps the most hated policy in China. Now, under relaxed restrictions announced just over a year ago, couples like Yang Xue and Chang Zi'an, both professionals working in Beijing, are eligible for a second child to join their baby girl -- 11-month-old Tao Zi, or Little Peach. Chang was an only child but sometimes wished for a sibling while growing up. ""Once my cousin visited and we shared a bed for several nights,"" says Chang, now an engineer. ""I enjoyed that feeling. I wished I had a brother who could share a bed with me every night."" Chang and his young family live in Tongzhou, on the eastern outskirts of Beijing, where high rise apartments compete with mega malls. Some call the area ""Tong-afornia,"" because its sprawl of young professionals is a bit like parts of the Golden State. They are ideal candidates, it would seem, to have a second child. The Party is in a race against the clock. China faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce. The government says the country could become home to the most elderly population on the planet in just 15 years, with more than 400 million over the age of 60. Researchers say healthcare and social services will all be burdened by the greying population, and the world's second largest economy will struggle to maintain its growth. ""China has already begun to feel an unfolding crisis in terms of its population change,"" says Wang Feng, a professor at Fudan University and a leading demographic expert on China. ""History will look back to see the one-child policy as one of the most glaring policy mistakes that China has made in its modern history."" Perhaps surprisingly, Wang says that the one-child policy was both ineffective and unnecessary, since China's fertility rates were already slowing by the 1980s. The Chinese government still maintains that it was necessary to keep numbers down. But with around 150 million one-child families and a shrinking population, the Chinese government is moving cautiously, rather than doing away with the policy altogether. In January 2014, China said it would allow couples to have a second baby if the mother or father was an only child themselves. But, to the surprise of many, the new rules haven't yet sparked a baby boom. Nationwide, nearly one million couples have applied to have a second child, state media reported in January. Health officials had said that the policy would lead to as many as two million new births when the policy change was first announced. Yang and Chang both have good jobs, but rent in Tongzhou is sky-high. And they want to send little Tao Zi to a private bilingual English and Chinese pre-school to help her in the ultra-competitive Chinese education system. Even if they were richer, they say they wouldn't want a second child. ""Money is only part of the problem,"" says Yang. ""Your energy and your time is also important. We both have to work. It is hard enough to raise her as a success. It will be miserable if we had to go through that again."" As for his cousin's sleepovers, Chang wants to clarify. ""It was great having him over, but I was also happy when he went home."" CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report .","China's controversial one-child policy was recently relaxed .

"(CNN)Us Weekly magazine has retracted a story about model and reality star Kendall Jenner and her father, former Olympian Bruce Jenner. ""We would like to retract the story entirely and have removed it from our website. We sincerely apologize to Ms. Jenner and her family,"" the magazine said Thursday on its website. Us Weekly had quoted the sister, a member of the Kardashian family, as saying she supported her father, who has made entertainment headlines over rumors that he is becoming a woman. ""He's a wonderful man. And just because he's changing shoes now, so to speak, doesn't make him less wonderful. I will always love my dad, whether he's a man or a woman,"" the magazine quoted her as saying. But Kendall Jenner said she never said that. ""How is it legal for someone to 'quote' someone and publish it if in fact you never said what was quoted?"" she tweeted. Us Weekly said on its website: ""The interview was allegedly conducted by an independent freelance journalist at the Saturday, March 14, taping of Comedy Central's roast of Justin Bieber in Los Angeles. When Ms. Jenner denied, via Twitter, that the interview took place, Us Weekly immediately reached out to the freelance reporter.

However, after attempting to reconfirm his account, editors of Us have concerns about the veracity of this interview and the circumstances under which it was obtained.""

"(CNN)A year ago, when Dr. Stephane Hugonnet was dispatched to Guinea to investigate a series of unexplained deaths, he had little  idea that he'd be contending with an outbreak that would quickly spread from a small southern rainforest village, across borders, and around the world. The Ebola outbreak, ravaging primarily Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, is a year old today. According to one official count, it's infected 24,000 people and killed 10,000. And it's managed to do so because of an institutional failure on several levels: weak public health systems locally and a painfully slow response globally. But in order to get to where we are, we need to go back to how it began. It takes a village . Before the virus ravaged West Africa, before the deaths soared into the thousands, before the outbreak triggered global fears, Ebola struck a toddler named Emile Ouamouno . The 2-year-old boy is who researchers with The New England Journal of Medicine believe was the first person to contract the disease in December 2013. Emile lived in a rainforest village in southern Guinea. How he got infected, no one is sure, but Ebola can be spread from animals to humans through infected fluids or tissue. One thing that is certain, within a month Ebola not only took Emile's life, but also those of his mother, sister and grandmother. From there, it spread like wildfire, passing to neighboring villages and beyond when people attended the grandmother's funeral. Where they went, the virus followed. By the time Dr. Hugonnet landed in Guinea, he didn't yet know that it was already too late. Hugonnet leads the Global Capacities, Alert and Responses team of the World Health Organization, and was one of the first doctors on the ground. ""We were following this rumor of a small cluster of unexplained deaths in Guinea,"" he said in a first-hand account of the early days of the crisis.  ""When the lab results came back, we learned that there was Ebola Zaire in West Africa. This was a first."" Hugonnet was working with a team of logisticians, a medical anthropologist, laboratory technicians, virologists and infection prevention and control specialists. It was an impressive collection of professionals with the goal of rapidly assessing the situation and getting it under control, keep it localized. But this outbreak was different, Hugonnet said. ""Person-to-person transmission had quickly spread from a rural area to a large urban city,"" making it harder to contain, he said.  ""And, the outbreak was becoming multi-national; cases were confirmed in Liberia and were suspected in Sierra Leone."" From those early days, the outbreak would mushroom. In July, Patrick Sawyer became the first American citizen to die at a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia. His case raised fears the virus could spread beyond the countries at the heart of the outbreak. And it does. International flights took the disease as far as Spain and the United States. On August 6, a businessman with Ebola died in a hospital in Saudi Arabia. He had been to Sierra Leone for work. Five days later, a Spanish Catholic Brother died in Madrid. And on September 20, . The Spanish Catholic Brother with Ebola, Brother Miguel Pajares, dies in Madrid. September 20, a Liberian named Thomas Duncan arrived in Dallas to visit relatives. He had been unknowingly exposed to the Ebola virus -- and he became the first known case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S. He died a few days later. Meanwhile, the disease took an ugly toll in West Africa . By September, it had orphaned about 3,700 children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Scared relatives didn't want to take them in, and officials worried the number of kids without parents would rise higher -- much higher. ""Ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence,"" said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF's regional director. ""We cannot respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways. We need more courage, more creativity, and far, far more resources."" Why didn't we? In a scathing new report, published Monday, Doctors Without Borders puts the blame squarely on a ""global coalition of inaction"" that waited months to respond to the epidemic. ""The Ebola epidemic proved to be an exceptional event that exposed the reality of how inefficient and slow health and aid systems are to respond to emergencies,"" said  said Dr Joanne Liu, the organization's international president in the report, ""Pushed to the Limit and Beyond."" For example, by March 21, 2014, 78 victims had died, mostly in Guinea. The World Health Organization said at the time that while the Ebola outbreak is serious, it is ""relatively small, still."" ""For the Ebola outbreak to spiral this far out of control required many institutions to fail,"" said Christopher Stokes, the director general for Doctors Without Borders.  ""And they did, with tragic and avoidable consequences."" Local hospitals were overwhelmed. International response was weak. By October, when Sierra Leone was reporting a rate of five infections an hour, UNICEF said it had received only 25% of the $200 million it needed for emergency assistance for families affected by Ebola in the region. A significant challenge remains ahead, Doctors Without Borders says. ""To declare an end to the outbreak, every single person in contact with someone infected with Ebola must be identified. There is no room for mistakes or complacency; the number of cases weekly is still higher than in any previous outbreak, and overall cases have not significantly declined since late January."" It's sobering news a year into the outbreak. Although the headlines have faded a bit from public view, the threat has not. CNN's Holly Yan contributed to this report.","The world was just starting to become aware of the Ebola outbreak a year ago .

"London (CNN)The handwritten checklist looks like something any teenaged girl might make ahead of a vacation trip:  makeup, bras, underwear, boots, an epilator. But this list was apparently made by the three UK schoolgirls suspected of traveling from London to Syria to join ISIS, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper, which has seen the document. The girls' families told British lawmakers Tuesday they had no idea what the girls were planning, and said they were baffled by the teenagers' decision to leave their homes and families. The three East London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- boarded a Turkish Airlines plane from London's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul on February 17. They are thought to have crossed the Turkish border into Syria within days. Relatives also had harsh words for police, who they said failed to keep them informed after a close friend of the girls headed to Syria in December. Amira Abase's father, Hussen Abase, told lawmakers at a hearing of the Home Affairs Select Committee that he had no idea his daughter was planning to go or that she might have been radicalized. Sahima Begum, the older sister of Shamima Begum, said her sister had been into ""normal teenage things,"" like watching ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"" reading and playing games on her phone. There was nothing to indicate she was radicalized, she said. Fahmida Aziz, first cousin of Kadiza Sultana, said that if the family had spotted any signs of radicalization, ""we would have been very effective in stepping in and querying"" that thinking. She also said she had no idea how her cousin accessed the money needed for the trip. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said it was ""every parent's nightmare that this should happen"" and said he could only imagine the families' distress and anguish. Who are the missing UK girls? The families' criticism of law enforcement hinges on a February 5 letter from the police which was given to the three girls to give to their parents, rather than being sent directly to the parents. The families claim they were not told about a 15-year-old friend of the girls going to Syria weeks earlier -- and say that had they known, they might have been able to prevent their daughters from traveling too. Metropolitan Police Chief Bernard Hogan-Howe apologized for his officers' failure to get the letter directly to the parents, in his testimony before the committee. But he also pointed out the difficulties for police in conducting what was at that time a missing person inquiry for the first girl who left, with no sign that these three were planning to follow suit. Hogan-Howe said police were reviewing their procedures in light of what had happened. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told the committee there was a ""steady flow"" of girls trying to travel to Syria, perhaps one or two a month. He said subsequent police investigations indicated the three girls had paid in cash for their plane tickets to Turkey at a local travel agency, using money linked to the theft of jewelry from their families. None of the girls was reported missing until several hours after the flight had left for Istanbul. However, the families' lawyer asked how they had managed, as minors, to board the flight without being challenged. CCTV footage also later showed that the girls spent much of the next day waiting at a bus station on the outskirts of Istanbul -- raising more questions about why they were not spotted then and whether UK police had communicated effectively with Turkish authorities. Rowley said that two people have been arrested in relation to child abduction in relation to the first girl who went missing, who has not been named. Asked how the UK might be able to get the girls back, Rowley cited an incentive: As long as they're not connected to terrorist offenses, they'll be able to return to their families. Rowley said police have no evidence that the girls have been involved in terrorism-related activities, and if that remained the case, they wouldn't be treated as terrorists upon their return. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West? The list was reportedly found in the bedroom of one of the girls and handed to police after her family realized she was missing. It detailed items to buy, such as underwear, a mobile phone and cosmetics, and estimated travel costs, apparently totaling £2,190 ($3,296). The biggest single cost was the three plane tickets to Turkey, the newspaper said, at just over £1,000. The list, written on a page from a diary planner, had initials indicating which of the girls was to buy what or who the items were for. It's not clear where they would have gotten the money to meet the costs. Over the weekend, the girls' families asked for an apology from London's Metropolitan Police over the force's handling of the case. The police said in a statement Saturday that after the first girl went missing in December, a police officer spoke to seven of her school friends at Bethnal Green Academy -- including Shamima, Kadiza, and Amira -- as potential witnesses who might have information about the missing girl. A deputy principal at the girls' school was present for the meeting and afterward contacted the parents of the seven girls, on the advice of police, and told them that the girls' friend, referred to only as ""Girl 1,"" had been reported missing. An officer who then spoke to the same group of girls on February 5 gave them the letters addressed to their parents asking for further help from their daughters, the police statement said. But not all the letters were passed on. ""With the benefit of hindsight, we acknowledge that the letters could have been delivered direct to the parents,"" the police statement said. ""However, the parents were already aware from the Deputy Head that Girl 1 had been reported missing, all the teenagers were all being co-operative, they were all being treated as potential witnesses and there was nothing whatsoever to indicate that they themselves were planning to travel to Syria."" What is ISIS' appeal for young people? Days before they left for Turkey, at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman, Aqsa Mahmood, who left her home in Scotland to travel to Syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media. She has posted tips for girls and young women wanting to travel to Syria to marry jihadis, as she did. Her blog also has links to advice posted by another jihad supporter, which recommends that those traveling to Syria seek to pack the essentials but not too much, since they may need to move often and at short notice, while remaining inconspicuous.

"Tunis (CNN)Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi confirmed that a third person took part in last week's Bardo museum terror attack in an interview Sunday with French TV Station iTele. ""There were for certain three terrorists,"" Essebsi said.  ""There is one on the run. He will not get far."" Previously two suspects had been identified -- Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou -- though it wasn't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces. He said Yassine was ""known to the security services, he was flagged and monitored,"" but not known or being followed for anything special. Authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack, including four directly linked to it, according to Essebsi. The development came a day after the bodies of four Italian tourists slain in the attack arrived back in Italy, an official with the Tunis Crisis Center told CNN, but 14 victims' remains still lie in the morgue. Most of the 23 victims were foreigners, making the process of identification more complicated. Nineteen of them were tourists who'd been on two cruise ships that docked in Tunis. French, Spanish, Italian, British, Japanese, Russian and Colombian citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far. The bodies of the Italians were met in Rome by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony. Eleven people who were injured in the attack remained in the hospital in Tunisia on Saturday, the official at the Tunis Crisis Center said. An uncle of Yassine Labidi, Abeld Malik Labidi, told CNN on Friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew. But he said Yassine Labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum. ""It's true that Yassine carried out this terrorist attack, he was killed; his head, his body, we don't have it back,"" he said. But, he said, he believed Yassine and other young Tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money, organized the logistics and took them to places like Syria and Libya to train as fighters. He had known his nephew well, he said. ""After the revolution of 2011 he started to pray, before he would drink beers from time to time, like a young Tunisian. He wasn't extreme in any way."" The only thing that raised questions was that Yassine had disappeared for about a month, he said. Although his nephew said he'd gone to the Tunisian city of Sfax to work, his family now suspected he had been in Libya because of the phone numbers he called from. ""When he came back his behavior was the same: he was still himself, calm, serious. Nobody noticed anything, even the neighbors I spoke to,"" said Abeld Malik Labidi. ""He said hello to everyone, he prayed, he took his coffee, even on the day of the attack he took his coffee with his family and went to work."" Abeld Malik Labidi said Yassine's father, sister and brother had undergone lengthy interrogations by anti-terror police since the attack. Officers had seized his nephew's computer and phone, as well as taking samples of his fingerprints, he said. A cousin of Yassine, who asked not to be named, told CNN that the family was shocked by what had happened. ""We are all shocked, we lost someone even if what he did was wrong, may God forgive him. Those he killed were innocent, why would you go and harm Australians or Japanese ... our Islam doesn't mention about killing people, Islam has never been this,"" he said. He also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized, saying he was ""a normal Tunisian guy ... but not an extremist."" Security Minister Rafik Chelly said on Friday that the two extremists who attacked the museum got weapons training at camps in Libya. The suspects were activated from sleeper cells in Tunisia, he said. He did not say which group activated them, or with whom they trained. ""They left the country illegally last December for Libya, and they were able to train with weapons there,"" he told private broadcaster AlHiwar Ettounsi TV. Like Tunisia, Libya saw its longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the Arab Spring. But unlike its neighbor to the west, Libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by Islamist militants. In an audio message posted online Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, which it said targeted ""crusaders and apostates"" with ""automatic weapons and hand grenades."" CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. That bloodshed is ""just the start,"" the ISIS message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow, but nonetheless adds extra urgency for Tunisian investigators. CNN's Claudia Rebaza reported from Tunis and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Radina Gigova and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Tunisian President says third person who took part in museum attack is on the run .

"(CNN)There's been plenty of talk lately about how dangerous stereotypes can be when it comes to the empowerment of our girls and young women. For instance, the #LikeAGirl campaign, which took a hammer to the notion that doing anything ""like a girl"" should be viewed as an insult, has become an international sensation. Less discussed, though, is the reality that our boys face damaging stereotypes too. That was the motivation behind a recent workshop held by SheKnows Media, a leading women's lifestyle media company. A group of New York City tween boys ranging in age from 8 to 10 got together as part of the company's Hatch program, which focuses on teaching digital literacy and citizenship to the next generation. The boys were shown dozens of advertisements perpetuating hypermasculine stereotypes, such as images of men all muscled up and not wearing shirts. In one ad for a big truck, the boys heard the tag line ""Can a truck change how people feel about a guy?"" Is the 'be a man' stereotype hurting boys? Another advertisement, this one for a clothing company, showed a man from the waist down along with the caption ""Wear the pants."" ""That's a man wearing the pants so that shows that men are in charge,"" said one of the boys, who's 9. What was clear was that this group of boys knew what the advertisers were trying to get them to think, but they weren't exactly buying it. ""I play with girl toys and boy toys. I don't really care which one is meant for boys or for girls. I just play with them. They're toys,"" said another boy, also 9. ""Man up"" might mean toughen up and be unemotional, said another boy, who added that his image of what a man should be is completely different. ""If I were to describe the perfect man, the words would be smart, not judgy, and kind,"" said the 10-year-old. 'Dad' gets a makeover in Super Bowl ads . These boys certainly can't speak for all tween boys, but their comments reflect what appears to be growing attention surrounding the use of gender stereotypes for boys as well as girls. Seventy-six percent of men who took part in a recent online survey by SheKnows Media admitted using phrases like ""man up"" and ""be a man"" toward boys. Of the more than 1200 men and women surveyed from across the country, 73% said boys are most often described as ""aggressive,"" 69% said ""strong"" and 53% said ""athletic."" When the men were asked about stereotypes during their teen years, 72% said they became aware of physical attractiveness and 50% said they grew more conscious about weight. Kids as young as 5 concerned about body image . The awareness starts even earlier, according to a recent analysis of existing research on kids and body image by Common Sense Media, a child advocacy group. It found that over a third of boys ages 6 to 8 think their ideal weight should be thinner than their current body weight. ""These are problems that are often thought of as problems for girls, but boys are just as impacted and they're exposed to unrealistic body images,"" said Ellen Pack, vice president of marketing for Common Sense Media, which is partnering with SheKnows Media to help parents understand the impact that media and technology are having on children. ""The proportion of undressed males in advertising has been steadily on the rise since the 1980s,"" said Pack. ""The same kinds of inappropriate messages that we're giving to our girls, we're giving to our boys too -- that they don't measure up, that they're not adequate."" At the same time, there does appear to be more open-mindedness on what being masculine means to men and boys today, based on the poll's findings. Of the men surveyed by SheKnows, 78% said it was OK for boys to cry, 65% thought it was fine for boys to wear pink, and 55% of men said boys should be able to play dress-up. ""You should be able to do your own things and do what you want,"" said one of the boys, who is 8. Sheryl Sandberg teams up with the NBA to get men to lean in . The takeaway for parents is that they, more than anyone or anything else, influence the stereotypes their boys will encounter and what impact those stereotypes will ultimately have on them. ""We found the single most significant driver of their perception of what's OK for boys was their parents,"" said Samantha Skey, chief marketing officer for SheKnows Media. ""It wasn't pop culture or Adam Levine or Usher. It was their parents,"" she said. ""If their parents think they're strong and appropriately masculine, then they are. Period."" Pack, of Common Sense Media, says parents should be talking about the issue to their boys when they are young, even as young as 5, and should call out stereotypes when they see them. ""Don't just turn your eyes. Use it as an opportunity to engage in a conversation with your kids and challenge assumptions,"" Pack said. ""When you are seeing things on TV that you think are unrealistic, point it out."" I, for one, wish we could wipe out ""be a man"" and ""man up"" from all of our vocabularies. But, actually, why do we need to remove the language? We just need to change what it means. The tweens involved in the Hatch workshop offer some real-life evidence that that may be already happening. ""When you go your own way, it feels good because you feel free and you can do what you want to do, and you don't have to do what other people say,"" one of the boys said. What do you think is the best way to empower boys and young men to tune out negative gender stereotypes?

"(CNN)Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will announce Monday that he is launching his campaign to become the 2016 Republican nominee for president. Cruz has been positioning for this nomination almost since he entered the upper chamber in 2012. His announcement takes place at a bastion of  conservatism, Liberty University, the institution founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell. Cruz is going to run from the right. He has spent much of his short career in Washington blasting the ""mushy middle"" of his party (which might be news to most Democrats), which he dismisses as a ""failed electoral strategy."" During a recent visit to New Hampshire, where he vowed to eliminate the Department of Education and the Internal Revenue Service, Cruz said that ""I'm pretty sure, here in New Hampshire, y'all define gun control like we do in Texas: Gun control is when you hit at what you aim at."" Fifty years ago, another Republican senator ran this kind of campaign, Arizona's Barry Goldwater, who took on President Lyndon Johnson. Cruz will test the conventional wisdom that Goldwater's strategy was and remains a failure. When Republicans voted to nominate him in 1964, Goldwater told the delegates that ""extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And moderation in the pursuit of justice no virtue."" When the icon of moderate Republicans, New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, spoke to the convention, the delegates hissed and booed. The outcome was far from great for the GOP. Johnson defeated Goldwater in a landslide election that brought in huge liberal Democratic majorities that passed the exact programs that conservatives abhorred. Although Goldwater was clearly wrong when he ran in 1964, Cruz thinks that the times have changed. Is he right? Right now, the chances are not great. If Cruz really sticks to this strategy of extremism, he faces very long odds of making it to the White House. The strategy might help him to garner some primary votes against Jeb Bush in red states, but it is not an approach with a great track record. Even as the Republican Party has shifted to the right in recent decades, Republican candidates who have obtained the nomination, and those who have also won the presidency, always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes. Ronald Reagan had anti-communism and tax cuts to attract voters into one big tent, and George H.W. Bush had a thousand points of light. His son George W. Bush emphasized policies tied to ""compassionate conservatism"" to prove that he was not an extreme zealot. Even Republicans who didn't win in the general elections, like John McCain and Mitt Romney, did not win the primary and caucus tallies by only playing to the base. Notwithstanding the conventional wisdom, even in primaries it seems that Republican voters understand the importance of finding someone who has the potential to win in November. This coming election will be tough for Republicans. As all the experts have shown, the electoral college math does not favor the GOP. Some experts have predicted that Democrats have over an 80% chance of winning the Electoral College. According to the Washington Post, if one looks at the states where the margin was narrow in the 2012 election, five currently favor Democrats (Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania) while in others, like Colorado, Democrats have a very good chance of winning as a result of demographic trends, namely growing minority populations that favor their party's nominee. Barring any dramatic changes in the coming months, Democrats will also have a very strong and seasoned nominee in Hillary Clinton. Cruz is also not just someone who defends extremism but a politician who can easily be tied to the congressional obstructionism that has turned off so much of the electorate. The Republican Party has been dragged down by the kind of politics that voters have observed in Washington. In 2014, congressional approval ratings plummeted to 14%. As the new year began, the approval ratings were only slightly better: just 16%. This is the congressional Republicanism where Cruz comes from. Many voters who like conservatism and the GOP don't love what their representatives are doing on Capitol Hill. The kind of scorched earth, always say no to anything politics has not done well in terms of the favorability ratings. There have been few practitioners of this style of legislative politics as prominent as Cruz. During his campaign for the presidency, he might pay the price for the kind of politics that brought him great attention in Congress. When Goldwater squared off against Johnson in 1964, the President predicted that there would be a ""frontlash"" of Republican and independent voters who would move way from the GOP just because Goldwater was at the top of the ticket. This was Johnson's response to predictions of a backlash in the South from Democrats who were angry about civil rights. The frontlash, Johnson explained to Bill Moyers is ""liberals, independents, moderate Republicans."" The electorate is not as likely to experience any dramatic swings like we saw in Midwestern states in 1964, where solidly Republican areas went Democratic because they were scared off by Goldwater, but a Cruz campaign could be exactly what Democrats need to cement victories in the swing states where the outcome is still uncertain. Monday, Cruz will bask in the spotlight of his announcement. But Republicans are going to have to really think hard about whether they want to put all of their electoral eggs in this volatile basket which, at least based on the history, has a very slim chance of winning.","Julian Zelizer: If Ted Cruz follows Barry Goldwater's path, he and his party could lose big .

"New Delhi (CNN)In an unusual public raid in India, thousands stormed a jail and dragged out a rape suspect before beating him to death on the streets, authorities said Friday. The 35-year-old suspect, who was described as an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh, died from severe injuries before officers could rescue him, said L.L. Doungal, a police official in the remote Nagaland state, where the attack occurred Thursday evening. ""There were thousands of them. Many of them were students in uniform,"" Doungal said, referring to the mobs involved in the incident. The suspect was accused of raping a local  woman last month. Since the attack,  tensions have grown between the native Nagas and Bangladeshi migrants in the district, police said. Thousands of protesters demanding cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers tore into the prison complex  Thursday and pulled out the suspect, Doungal said. Police initially used teargas and bamboo canes to rescue the man, but it didn't work, he said. ""There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force,"" Doungal added. Later, police opened fire, but it was too late to save the suspect. Protesters had planned a public hanging, but the suspect died from injuries in the attack,  according to authorities. ""We retrieved his body before it could be hung,"" Doungal said. Dimapur town has been placed under a curfew. ""The situation is still volatile,"" he said. India made international headlines this month when it banned a documentary  showing an interview with a convicted rapist, who blamed his victim and said she ""should just be silent and allow the rape."" Outrage has grown following the incident, which gives a window into the violence against women in the nation. The woman in the documentary incident was attacked by five men on a public bus in 2012. She later died from her injuries, sparking an outcry worldwide. New Delhi police said the interview was banned because of its potential to breed disorder.

"(CNN)Boko Haram, the Nigeria-based Islamist terror group, has pledged allegiance to ISIS, according to an audio message purported to be from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau. In the audio, which was posted online Saturday, the speaker says Boko Haram is announcing its ""allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims, Ibrahim ibn Awad ibn Ibrahim al-Husseini al-Qurashi,"" which is another name for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. CNN has not been able to independently authenticate the message. But Jacob Zenn, an expert on the terror group and is with the Jamestown Foundation, said the recording appeared to be authentic. He said that while other messages have been faked, the speaker in this one is Shekau. ""Boko Haram joining the ISIS fold makes sense to both groups,"" he said from Abuja, Nigeria. ""Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands into (French-speaking) West Africa. It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS's biggest affiliate. ""ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate."" Zenn said the allegiance will be official when an ISIS leader such as spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani issues a statement. Boko Haram has had two main factions -- one led by Shekau and the other comprising former members of  Ansaru, a Boko Haram offshoot. Ansaru had been operating from around 2012 as the Nigerian wing of AQIM (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). After the French-led intervention in Mali in 2013, a significant number of Ansaru members re-integrated with Shekau, Zenn told CNN. The prerequisite for Boko Haram joining ISIS coalition was a coming together of two factions. ISIS connected with former Ansaru fighters within Boko Haram and pressed them to further unify the group's ranks. The result was the formation of a unity general command between the two factions. That involved bridging of some ideological differences between the al Qaeda-like Ansaru and the ultra extreme ""takfiri""-like Shekau. The pledge follows a period during which Shekau's faction had been mimicking ISIS, including praising al-Baghdadi and featuring his image in their videos and photos. Zenn said that until recently there had been little feedback from ISIS, apart from a few references to Nigerian jihadis in recent issues of the English-language Dabiq magazine. It appears that a month ago ISIS set up a Twitter account on which Saturday's message was linked, Zenn said. The Twitter handle was mutually promoted by Boko Haram and ISIS. In July, Shekau voiced support for ISIS, and declared a overtaken town in northeast Nigeria to be part of an Islamic caliphate. But he also said he was praying for al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar. U.S. intelligence officials have some doubts the two groups would get along. The CIA's analysis has been that Boko Haram is very African and rooted in that region's Islamic practices, even if they have similar fundamentalist interpretations of Islam.  And ISIS's Arab leadership and membership tends to have racist attitudes toward blacks, not unlike the society they come from. ISIS leaders view Shekau as inferior, partly for racist reasons, the CIA indicated at a briefing for reporters. Boko Haram, whose name translates as ""Western education is sin,"" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard. CNN's Steve Almasy and Evan Perez contributed to this story.","Audio message was released online Saturday and speaker is said to be Boko Haram leader .
