"Kell Brook has called Amir Khan's bluff regarding a potential grudge fight between the pair - telling his British rival: 'It's not about money for me.' The calls for Khan to finally settle his long-running feud with Brook have grown stronger in the last few days, but the Bolton fighter insists he has more pressing issues. While Khan is keen to meet the IBF welterweight champion 'one day', he added he would be keen on a winner-takes-all fight. Kell Brook called out Amir Khan in an interview after beating Jo Jo Dan in Sheffield on Saturday night . Khan's last fight came against Devon Alexander in December, whom he beat to take his record to 30-3 . Brook, though, is unfazed as he told Sky Sports News HQ: 'It's not about money for me. It's about everywhere I go, (people asking) ""when are you going to fight him?"". 'It's public demand now. I think that he's getting forced in to this fight if he gets in.' Brook defended his world title with a four-round demolition job of mandatory challenger Jo Jo Dan over the weekend and is supremely confident he could do a similar job on Khan, whose much-maligned chin is still considered to be a major weakness. 'He's been knocked down to the canvas by super-featherweights in his career,' said Brook. 'He's fighting a big, strong welterweight in myself who's a world champion, who's very confident, who's never lost, who's determined to flatten him. 'Don't get me wrong, Amir Khan is a very, very, very good fighter; very fast hands, most definitely the fastest hands I will have been in with. But the fact is when I connect on his chin, it's good night Vienna. 'I'm all wrong for him. I'll find a way to catch him, we've got 12 rounds. We'll have the perfect gameplan.' Brook demolished Dan in Sheffield, beating him in just four rounds to retain his IBF World Welterweight title . Khan has previously refused a fight with Brook but now promises it will take place within 12 months . Khan, though, is chasing a showdown with the winner of the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao super-fight and told Brook earlier on Tuesday that he would have to wait his turn. 'I'd love to fight Kell Brook because it could be his last fight - I'd give him so much of a beating that it could end up being his last fight,' Khan told Sky Sports. 'Maybe he wants it because he knows that one fight against me will financially secure him for the rest of his life. 'But it's all about timing. If I've got a different route and I want to face the likes of Mayweather or Pacquiao out there; Kell Brook will have to wait. 'It'll happen one day and if Kell really wants to fight me, I'll fight him, but the winner takes all. I'll do a huge bonus because I know he's going to lose the fight. 'Give him a little guarantee, but the guy who wins the fight takes a big lump sum. That's how confident I am against Kell Brook.' Brook, pictured celebrating his win over Dan on Saturday, appears to have got his wish to fight Khan . Promoter Eddie Hearn has responded to Khan by claiming the Olympic silver medallist has no interest in meeting his boxer. 'Amir seems to have this thing in his head about Kell not respecting him,' Hearn told Sky Sports News. 'Kell doesn't want to respect him - he wants to knock him out. Kell doesn't like him. It's quite simple. 'It's a tough fight. You can't take anything away from Amir Khan - he's a quality fighter. 'I just always felt that Kell Brook would win the fight. I don't think Khan would deal with Kell's power. 'Right now, Kell is golden and Amir is struggling to find an opponent. Whatever opponent he'll choose on May 30 isn't going to be Kell Brook and that's not what the public want. People will be disappointed with the opponent. 'Amir has put himself under pressure saying the fight will happen in the next 12 months and we hope so but unfortunately for him, Kell's stock continues to rise and the split is probably getting worse and worse as days go by. 'Winner takes all? I'll believe that when I see it because they have no desire to fight Kell Brook.'","Amir Khan has said he will fight Kell Brook within the next 12 months .

"One group of supporters will ride in a Hummer 130 miles to London, two special ales have hit the market and a song has entered the charts alongside the likes of Coldplay. The mayor ranks the occasion higher than Noddy Holder receiving the freedom of the borough. Walsall are at Wembley on Sunday for the first time in their 127-year history, taking on Bristol City in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy final, and fans are already celebrating. ‘I’ll be a 55-year-old kid,’ says Supporters Trust secretary Steve Davies. ‘To actually make it to the home of English football is something special.’ At 3.30pm, Walsall will happily exit a group of Football League teams never to have played at Wembley, leaving behind Accrington Stanley, Crawley Town and Hartlepool United. Walsall's Tom Bradshaw celebrates with supporters after booking their place in the JPT final at Wembley . They have come close four times. They lost to Bournemouth and Millwall in area finals of the same competition in 1998 and 1999. In 1984 they succumbed 4-2 over two legs to a Liverpool side featuring Ian Rush and Alan Hansen in their Milk Cup semi-final, and they were beaten by Crewe in the 1993 Third Division play-off semi. They did reach the 2001 Division Two play-off final against Alan Pardew’s Reading — but with Wembley under reconstruction, their 3-2 victory took place at the Millennium Stadium. That day in Cardiff, 15,000 fans showed up. Nearly 30,000 are making the trip to England’s capital, around seven times Walsall’s average home gate. ‘It’s unprecedented,’ says Walsall chief executive Stefan Gamble. ‘We’ve never had to deal with demand on this level. It has given the club, town, and supporters a real lift and captured the imagination. ‘For a club of our size it makes a significant impact on the manager’s playing budget for next season. This one match will generate more revenue than all our home games put together. It’s huge.’ Manager Dean Smith (centre) hailed the 'amazing achievement' admitting pride at getting Walsall to Wembley . Smith is the fourth longest-serving league manager behind Arsene Wenger, Paul Tisdale and Karl Robinson . More than 70,000 tickets have been sold, making the match the biggest in England this weekend and likely bettered only by El Clasico for attendance in Europe. Dean Smith, the fourth longest-serving league manager behind Arsenal’s Arsene Wenger, Exeter’s Paul Tisdale and Karl Robinson at MK Dons, has succeeded where many others have failed. ‘It’s an amazing achievement, especially when I think of the calibre of some of the managers who have been here before me,’ Smith says. ‘I feel very proud.’ The run began last October at Rochdale. Davies was among the 102 ‘hardy souls’ in attendance when Mathieu Manset scored the winner, his only goal for Walsall. He has since joined Cheltenham. There was then a slender victory over Sheffield United, cup conquerors of four Premier League teams in two seasons, and a penalty shootout win over Tranmere in the area semi-final. Preston were favourites in the area final but Walsall won the first leg at Deepdale 2-0 through late goals from Anthony Forde and Tom Bradshaw, aged 21 and 22. James Baxendale is carried by fans on the pitch at Banks' Stadium after a 2-0 aggregate win over Preston . Bradshaw is congratulated by supporters at the end of the 0-0 draw with Preston North End in January . ‘The second leg was fraught,’ says Davies. ‘We tend to be a little fatalistic as Walsall fans. Even at 2-0 we wouldn’t actually believe it was happening until the fat lady sang. We’d been to the area final twice before and cocked it up.’ The match at the Banks’s Stadium ended goalless in front of 10,038 fans — but chairman Jeff Bonser was not among them, having been in self-imposed exile from home matches for close to five years. Bonser, who took control of Walsall in 1992, stopped going in the face of fierce criticism from fans over his running of the club, having decided his presence would undermine performances. He will be at Wembley, though. ‘He comes into the club every day during the week and still fully supports the club both financially and morally,’ says Gamble. ‘He is as keen as anyone to see us win.’ Former players will be in the stands, too. Watford striker Troy Deeney, who scored 27 goals in 136 games for Walsall, visited his old manor on Wednesday to buy his ticket and Mark Rees, who played in that League Cup tie against Liverpool 31 years ago, will be there. Davies, meanwhile, has booked a Hummer for the drive down. ‘We’re doing it properly,’ he laughs. A young Walsall supporter celebrates after the club reached the final of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy . Many fans will have supped either (or both) of the ales produced in recognition. The Backyard Brewhouse, the only brewery in Walsall, has been pumping Super Saddlers beer to local pubs in recent weeks and the Supporters’ Trust have a limited number of bottles of their own offering, which features a picture of Forde’s goal from the Preston game on the label. Walsall FC Go To Wembley, a song by local band The Assist, is riding high in the iTunes ‘alternative’ music chart, sparring with tracks by Coldplay and the Arctic Monkeys. ‘It’s not a singalong, they’re an indie band. The lads are chuffed,’ says Davies. The town has been painted red. Literally. A famous concrete hippo in the centre has received a splash of club colours. ‘There have been some memorable events recently but this will be the highlight whether we win or lose,’ says councillor Pete Smith, the mayor. ‘The second is when we gave Noddy Holder, a Walsall lad, freedom of the borough.’ Come on feel the noise.","Walsall take on Bristol City at Wembley Johnstone's Pain Trophy final .

"A cold Saturday in Ashington on England's north east coast is a far cry from some sun-baked cricket pitch in the Tropics but for Steve Harmison there is no other place he would rather be as he upholds a family tradition. In his prime Harmison was one of cricket's elite fast bowlers, taking 226 test wickets for England and starring in a side that included Andrew Flintoff, Kevin Pietersen, Michael Vaughan and James Anderson. Now, with his cricketing whites retired for good, he is forging a career as a football manager in the former mining heartland of northern England. Steve Harmison took over his hometown club Ashington FC in February after retiring from cricket . The Newcastle United fan has returned to run hometown club Ashington FC of the Northern League Division One, the ninth tier of English football, where he stewards a team of teachers, bricklayers, students, sports coaches and factory workers. With England cricketers toiling at the World Cup, Harmison is embroiled in a relegation struggle, although since he took over last month, the 36-year-old has overseen a change in fortunes with three victories and two defeats. His side are also in the semi-final of the Northern League Cup. The Northern League side have won three and lost two in Harmison's first five games in charge . The former England cricketer have a chance of some silverware after reaching the semi-finals of the cup . His aching back, a legacy of the punishing strain of bowling balls at nearly 100mph, still causes him pain, but the camaraderie of a team environment makes up for it. 'I've always been asked if I miss playing (cricket). No, not one bit,' Harmison, who retired from cricket in 2013, told the Sunday Times. 'But I miss the dressing room like you've never seen. 'Ashington is not a very big place so if you come from Ashington you support the cricket team and you support the football team. The northeast is like that.' The ex-fast bowler admits he doesn't miss playing the game of cricket but he misses the dressing room . Ashington holds a special place in Harmison's heart. He was born in the town and his father was a stalwart for the club as a player and later an assistant manager. 'Managing anyone else would not have been interest to me,' Harmison added. 'It tells you what Ashington means to all of us. 'To the family it means a hell of a lot. It tells you a lot that in 1966 he's there as a boy in the background and in 2015 I'm managing the place. 'Did anyone from my family say, 'Are you sure?'. Yes, James (Harmison's brother and first signing as manager). He knew what was coming. My wife was fine, the kids are loving it. It all fell into place. Ashington FC are the only club Harmison would manage due to how much the club means to him . 'It gave me a purpose to get out of bed.'","Steve Harmison is now the manager of Northern League outfit Ashington .

"The absence of Gianluigi Buffon from Italy's team was a major blow for  Antonio Conte's side  before their 2-2 draw in Bulgaria in Euro 2016 qualifying on Saturday. Buffon was taken ill with flu shortly before the game but the legendary Juventus goalkeeper was seen back in training on Monday as the Azzurri stepped up their preparations for the visit of Roy Hodgson's England in Turin. The friendly is a repeat of the 2014 World Cup group match which Italy won 2-1 and Conte will want his team to repeat the result as he looks for a response to the draw that kept Italy second in Euro 2016 qualifying Group H.

But England and Italy failed to qualify from Group D in the World Cup, which resulted in a managerial change for the Azzurri as Conte replaced Cesare Prandelli. And Conte could be tempted into rotating his squad for the visit of England, with Southampton's Graziano Pelle potentially starting while Eder could get his second cap after marking his first  with a goal.","Gianluigi Buffon missed Italy's 2-2 draw with Bulgaria with flu .

"Arsenal dynamo Alexis Sanchez can already consider himself a legend in the game, according to former Real Madrid and Chile star Ivan Zamora.

"Trainer Aidan O’Brien has acknowledged that he is likely to have Ryan Moore riding more of his horses this season. Speculation has raged over the weekend about the likely riding plans for Ireland’s champion trainer with son and stable jockey Joseph having his first ride over hurdles at Limerick on Sunday when fifth on Egyptian Warrior. Joseph has said that he will be back riding on the Flat on Wednesday at Dundalk but the constant battle with the scales for the jockey who is almost 6ft tall has seemingly never been tougher. Aidan O’Brien has acknowledged that he is likely to have Ryan Moore riding more of his horses this season . The Warrior ridden by Ryan Moore on the way to winning the Big Bad Bob Maiden at Curragh Racecourse . Three-time British champion Moore stepped in for three rides for Aidan O’Brien at the Curragh on Sunday, winning the maiden on The Warrior. Moore’s reluctance to move to Ireland has always been an obstacle to a permanent role at Ballydoyle but O’Brien’s desire to secure his services more often is clear. The trainer said: ‘We've a good relationship with Ryan and we always have. We used Ryan more last year than we did the year before and hopefully it will be that way again this year.’ Jockey Joseph O'Brien (right) has struggled with weight issues over the past couple of years . Acknowledging his son’s weight issues, O’Brien added: ‘Obviously (doing) nine stone has been a problem for the last two seasons and last year it was a big problem. ‘This year he's heavier than he was this time last year. He'll go gently and we'll see what will happen. There's no doubt he'll come back down to the Flat gently and how far down he'll go, we'll wait and see.’ Joseph travelled from Limerick to the Curragh to ride in the annual gallops O’ Brien stages at the track and partnered 2,000 Guineas favourite. The colt is just one of a clutch of Classic hopefuls he can potentially ride this season. Australia gets a kiss from O'Brien after winning the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby at the Curragh Racecourse . Meanwhile, OIiver Sherwood has said his Hennessy Gold Cup winner Many Clouds will run in the Grand National a week on Saturday. The eight-year-old’s Aintree participation had been in doubt since his sixth to Coneygree in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Sherwood, successful with Puffin Billy at Ascot, said: ‘It is always a concern when (a race) is an after-thought but I still have it in the back of my mind that he did not run his race at Cheltenham . Many Clouds  jumps the last on their way to victory in the BetBright Cup Chase at Cheltenham Racecourse . ‘I don’t know if it was because we were put out of our comfort zone by the winner or just ran a bit flat.

"What do you do when you are in some of the world's most beautiful locations, and your wife doesn't want a photo. One husband found a novel way to overcome the problem, but using a teddy bear instead. Amateur photographer Christian Kneidinger has taken extensive holiday snaps of his bear in more than 21 breathtaking destinations.

"CSKA Moscow says Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev should be ready to play this weekend after recovering from being hit in the head with a flare during a European Championship qualifying match against Montenegro. A flare thrown from an area occupied by Montenegro fans hit Akinfeev in the back of the head during Friday's game. He was rushed to the hospital and treated for burns and a concussion.

"Fernando Alonso hailed McLaren’s progress as ‘fantastic’ despite qualifying a lowly 18th for Sunday’s Malaysian Grand Prix. Alonso and team-mate Jenson Button will start from the penultimate row, and have only been spared the embarrassment of propping up the grid after Manor were permitted to start tomorrow’s race by the stewards despite Roberto Merhi qualifying outside the 107 per cent rule and Max Stevens failing to post a time. It is the second consecutive grand prix where the McLaren have been knocked out in the first phase of qualifying, but Alonso, back in the cockpit after he missed the season opener in Melbourne through injury, moved to praise the team’s improvement. Fernando Alonso posted a picture with Ron Dennis (right) and Eric Boullier (second left) on Saturday evening . Fernando Alonso failed to make it out of Q1 and will start from 18th position in Sunday's Malaysian GP . Alonso, back at the wheel of a F1 car, hailed McLaren's progress since the opening race of the season . ‘I'd say the progress we've made since Australia has been fantastic,', said Alonso. ‘We're much closer to the cars in front now but we're still under-performing and we still need to improve.' Alonso then posted a picture on Twitter of him dining out with Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, and team principal Eric Boullier. The snap comes after Alonso contradicted McLaren's version of events surrounding the mysterious testing crash which ruled him out of the race in Melbourne. ‘Our form today wasn't unexpected but I think our performance so far this weekend has maybe been better than I'd have anticipated before arriving here in Malaysia,' Alonso added. ‘However, the steps we're taking with the car show a lot of progress, so I'm optimistic that I won't be qualifying in Q1 for that much longer. ‘This isn't an ideal position from which to start the race, but I'm fully aware that McLaren-Honda is a long-term project. We want to beat Mercedes, and to do that you need time, and to be prepared to take your chances as they come.’ Jenson Button will start from 17th on the grid, one place ahead of his McLaren team-mate Alonso . The Briton, sporting a moustache in Malaysia, believes there are a 'lot of positives' McLaren can drawn from . Button, who qualified one place ahead of Alonso, echoed his team mate's sentiments and admitted that the speed at which McLaren have closed the gap on the cars in front was a good sign. ‘Before qualifying, I think we'd have hoped to be a bit closer to the cars in front of us, but this weekend has seen us take a massive step forward in performance,’ said the Briton, who finished last and two laps down on race winner Lewis Hamilton at the curtain raiser in Australia. ‘Also, I think our race pace and our consistency over a long run look like giving us a little extra. I'd like to think we could get closer to some of the cars in front tomorrow; that'll be something to look forward to. ‘There are a lot of positives to take from this weekend: we've made a big step forwards in terms of pace. There's more to come from the engine and the aero package but we know what to do.’","Fernando Alonso will start on the penultimate row for Sunday's race .

"Mike Brown believes RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie was 'spot on' to describe England's RBS 6 Nations performance as unacceptable - but the Red Rose and Harlequins full back still thinks Stuart Lancaster's side are genuine World Cup contenders. England were only narrowly pipped to the Championship on points difference by Ireland after a dramatic final day and have had praise lavished on them from all quarters for their attacking brand of rugby, which saw them score 18 tries in five matches. But for Brown, like Ritchie, second place is simply not good enough. Mike Brown is adamant that second place is not good enough despite England's impressive performances . The Harlequins full back was in fine form for England throughout the Six Nations . 'We're not in there to be second so he's spot on really,' he said. 'We didn't have an aim of coming second, we had an aim of winning silverware and coming first, so he hasn't said anything we don't agree with or think ourselves. 'We don't accept coming second because we want to win, and that's it.' Brown has been forced to sit out Harlequins' trip to Wembley to face Saracens in the Aviva Premiership on Saturday with concussion. If you include the Italy match, when he was taken off after being knocked out in the opening minutes, it will be the third match out of five he has missed through concussion for country and club. With no game next week though, Brown is hoping an extended break and a holiday in the sun will have him fit and raring to go for the season finale. Brown said: 'It's disappointing but first and foremost it's about my health and with a big year coming up that's the most important thing for me and England. 'I got a couple of knocks right near the end of the France game and on Sunday and Monday had a little bit of a headache  so we're being cautious and doing the right things. 'I was off next week anyway, the England guys have a week off and there isn't a game so that was always the plan. 'So we'll see how I am after that, hopefully a bit of sun and a tan will cure it.' Brown lies motionless after being knocked out against Italy. He was taken off and missed the Ireland game . With just six months to go until the World Cup it is a nervous time for any England hopeful but, typical of the man, Brown is adamant the only way to approach the next two months of club rugby is to go hell for leather. 'It can be difficult because it's always in your mind, such a big goal,' Brown said of balancing club and country ambitions. 'I've never played in a World Cup so for me it's everything, it's what I've worked towards. 'And the fact it's in our home country adds a bit extra and we have got a realistic chance of winning the thing because of the way we are playing and the way we have progressed. 'It's hard not to think about but once you're back at your club the games come so thick and fast you leave it in the back of your mind and focus on just giving it your all.' With five matches to go, Quins are down in eighth place in the table, nine points off an automatic Champions Cup spot and four off a play-off place. For a side that won the title just three years ago and have finished in the top four in the last two seasons, it has been a campaign of disappointment so far. But with Brown, England captain Chris Robshaw, club captain Joe Marler and veteran No 8 Nick Easter all back in their ranks from international duty for the final push, they have more than a fighting chance of salvaging it. Brown trudges off the Twickenham pitch after England were pipped to the Championship by Ireland . Attention switches to club rugby now for Brown as Harlequins look to finish in the top six . Brown says: 'We want to be playing at the top level of European rugby, we want to have those great nights at the Stoop, so we're desperate to try and get that top six spot and we know we can do it.' Whatever the outcome, next season holds exciting prospects for Harlequins with legendary Lions prop Adam Jones and former Australia captain James Horwill joining their ranks. Brown enthused: 'Those two guys have played at the highest level, so that sort of experience will be great for us and great for our young guys. 'Jones will be great for our two young tight heads (Kyle) Sinckler and (Will) Collier who are going to turn out to be two world class players. 'I've heard he's a good character off the field as well so to have another guy like that to go with Minty (Easter) and Danny (Care) will be great for the squad and give it a good blend.' Brown works closely with GB Wheelchair Rugby and backs them as part of the Aviva Community fund, which launched this week. He has donated all of his autumn international man of the series prize money to them in 2013 and also sells his kit viainmylocker.com to raise money for the team. It is something that is close to his heart, as he explains. 'I got introduced to wheelchair rugby through my future father-in-law, he saw it on the internet and thought it might be something I'd be interested in, knowing the sort of fast-paced sports I like. 'There is a little link with my Dad as well because he's got mild MS and sometimes has to use a wheelchair. It's great to help in any way I can.'

"As a schoolgirl, Emma Lavelle had twin passions — politics and horses. Had she chosen to pursue the former, spring 2015, with an election looming, could well have proved an important time in her life. But the woman who now runs a 70-box stable in Hampshire is hoping that, having favoured horses over Hansard, the same period definitely turns out to be momentous when she saddles Court By Surprise, her first runner in the £1 million Crabbie's Grand National on April 11. If the 10-year-old wins, Lavelle would be the third female trainer to win Jump racing's best known race this century following Venetia Williams, with Mon Mome in 2009 and Sue Smith, with Auroras Encore in 2013. Emma Lavelle poses with Court By Surprise, her first runner in the £1 million Crabbie's Grand National . And she would also be feted, along with her former jockey husband and assistant Barry Fenton, for executing a long-term precision plan. Court By Surprise has not run since November as Lavelle patiently kept him fresh for the drier spring ground on which he excels. Lavelle said: 'I did a lot of public speaking and debating at school. Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. Love her or hate her, she was a big presence. I loved her. As a schoolgirl, Lavelle had twin passions — politics and horses - now she is targeting the Grand National . 'She got me interested in politics. I am opinionated and I like talking. I am not so sure now because it is all so grey but at the time I would have been happy to go down that road.' Lavelle's communication skills with owners and staff have been essential after a devastating setback at the start of the season when she lost two of her best horses. Timesremembered, who had finished sixth in the Coral Cup at the 2014 Cheltenham Festival, was killed in his first steeplechase, at Aintree in October, and Le Bec, thought capable of contesting top-quality steeplechases, suffered a serious tendon injury at Ascot a week later. Court By Surprise has not run since November as Lavelle patiently kept him fresh for the drier spring ground . Lavelle said: 'It really hit us hard. It was like a football team losing their best two players at the start of the season. 'It was hard to pick up and get going again. But you have to keep positive, keep going forward and take your team with you.' Lavelle's season has been rebuilt around Grade Two winner Closing Ceremony, much-improved Parish Business, exciting Bumper winner See The World and, of course, Court By Surprise, who is owned by Kempton chairman Nick Mustoe. Lavelle's decision to enter racing rather than politics was heavily influenced by the late Toby Balding . Court By Surprise ridden by Aidan Coleman clears the last to win the  Best Mate Handicap Steeple Chase . The National entry, who will be ridden at Aintree by Daryl Jacob, won at Exeter in October and was then awarded the Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton after finishing second to fast-improving unqualified entry, The Young Master. Subsequent events tell us Court By Surprise faced handicapping Everest that day. For Saturday week, trainer and horse have that essential Aintree ingredient — a good story to tell. Lavelle's decision to enter racing rather than politics was heavily influenced by working for the late Toby Balding, who won the Aintree race twice. Lavelle, who was first invited to spend a week with Balding aged 11 when he trained a horse for her father, said: 'I was so lucky he let me be so involved. I wasn't strong enough to carry the water bucket in the morning. I filled it and had to get someone to carry it back to the stable. When I look back I found it staggering that, even having ridden ponies, he let me ride racehorses. The National entry, who will be ridden at Aintree by Daryl Jacob, won at Exeter in October . 'He was someone you could learn as much as you wanted to off. If you asked the questions, he would give you the answers. He was a big man who enveloped you in everything.' Court By Surprise, an overpriced 50-1 shot allotted 10st 3lb, has overcome two serious problems — a leg injury when falling on his point-to-point debut and an infected leg which kept him off the course for almost two years and could have ended his career. Lavelle added: 'Having missed the best part of two years, he has not had much racing but maybe it is a blessing in disguise; he is so much stronger. Now, he's the best he's ever been.'","As a schoolgirl, Emma Lavelle had twin passions - politics and horses .

"England World Cup hopeful Henry Slade has been named Aviva Premiership player of month for February. The 21-year-old fly-half was in fine form throughout the month as Exeter Chiefs won all three of their matches to propel themselves right in to play-off contention. Slade scored 54 points in total, including two tries, in victories over Newcastle, Harlequins and Bath. Exeter Chiefs fly-half Henry Slade has been named Aviva Premiership player of the month for February . Slade scored 54 points including two tries as the Chiefs won all three of their matches in February . Slade has continued that fine form in to March, scoring a try and kicking a further 13 points in last weekend's 74-19 demolition of London Welsh that sent Exeter second in the table. England head coach Stuart Lancaster this week heaped praise on Slade, who can also play in the centres or at full-back, as he called the Chiefs playmaker in to his squad as an injury replacement for Brad Barritt. 'The more I see him, the more I think he's got fantastic potential,' said Lancaster. 'I've always known it having seen him come through the age-group teams. 'We have a lot of competition at fly-half, but he's also adept in the centres. That's one of the options I'd like to look at for him in the future. For definite he'll be a part of our World Cup camp.' Slade looks on during England training at Pennyhill Park this week after his call-up . Slade crossed during Exeter's win over London Welsh to make it three tries in four matches . Former England international, BT Sport analyst and Aviva ambassador Austin Healey was also glowing in his praise of Slade, who remains uncapped but did impress for an England XV against the Barbarians at Twickenham last summer. 'Every time Henry Slade touches the ball something happens,' Healey said. 'There is no doubt in my mind the lad has the potential to win 50 caps or more for England. He is too talented and works too hard not to achieve Test caps. 'I have been watching him closely this season and I believe he is ready to step into the England team now. The youngster scores a try at Twickenham as an England XV defeated the Barbarians last summer . Both Stuart Lancaster and Austin Healey talked up Slade's England prospects ahead of the World Cup . 'Henry is one of the best attackers in Aviva Premiership Rugby, is solid in defence and can kick goals – is there anything this lad can’t do? Those attributes make him a much deserved winner of the Aviva Premiership Rugby Player of the Month Award for February. 'The only decision left is where he finally plays for England. It could be any of three positions – 12, 13 or 15.' Slade beat Wasps outside back Elliot Daly, Northampton flanker Calum Clark and Newcastle winger Sinoti Sinoti to the award.","Slade scored 54 points in three matches in February including two tries .

"England might be out of the Cricket World Cup but they still provide the combatants for potentially the tournament’s biggest flashpoint, with arch-enemies Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann set to come face to face in the Test Match Special commentary box. Pietersen, who is being loaned to TMS for radio stints by his World Cup employers Fox Sports, will work alongside Swann for the first time at the Auckland semi-final a week on Tuesday. And the powderkeg confrontation between the ex-England team-mates, whose relationship disintegrated in the fall-out from the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash, has been given spice with the possibility KP might now return to county cricket and the national team. Graeme Swann and Kevin Pietersen, once happy team-mates, are not longer on such good terms . Swann and Pietersen are to help commentate on Test Mach Special for the World Cup semi-finals next week . Swann has accused KP of ‘upsetting people wherever he goes’, says the ECB were ‘justified’ in terminating his England contract and calls Pietersen’s autobiography a ‘work of fiction’. Despite the history, TMS producer Adam Mountford is hopeful there will be no trouble between the pair on the day, saying: ‘They’re adults, I’m sure they’ll behave professionally.’ If Pietersen were to pull out of the IPL and re-sign for Surrey, his most likely replacement at Sunrisers Hyderabad is Kumar Sangakkara. The Sri Lankan — Surrey’s overseas player — is only an IPL reserve despite four straight World Cup hundreds. Pietersen has announced his intention to return to county cricket to try and get back in the England set-up . The Six Nations is a rare BBC sporting event not involving Clare Balding. However, Scotland’s blond back-row forward David Denton answers to the nickname ‘Balding’ because of his hairstyle. England’s beleaguered cricket coach Peter Moores, with a reputation for being obsessed with statistics, is likely to be remembered for supposedly saying after the World Cup defeat against Bangladesh: ‘We thought 275 was chaseable, we’ll have to look at the data.’ Peter Moores came under fire for his 'data' response, but he actually said 'we'll have to look at that later' However, what Moores actually said to Test Match Special reporter Ali Mitchell was: ‘We’ll have to look at that later.’ Moores did mention data when interviewed by Sky Sports. Paul McGinley’s leadership insight that so impressed guests at the League Managers Association President’s Dinner last week included the revelation that he persuaded the European Tour to pair some of his potential Ryder Cup partnerships during regular tournaments — without them realising — to see how they gelled. Ryder Cup winning captain Paul McGinley has revealed he got the European Tour to help him test pairings . MCC plot with Cubans . Fidel Castro’s Communist Cuba is an unlikely ally of the MCC in their battle to repel property developers Rifkind Levy Partnership. The MCC hope to block RLP’s building plans behind the Warner Stand at Lord’s by switching a 10-year lease to Cuban Embassy staff. The £8m house earmarked for Cuba personnel is the home of MCC secretary Derek Brewer, who would transfer to the MCC-owned house on Grove End Road currently occupied by the Cubans. The MCC have further kept RLP at bay by buying another well-placed house on the same street. Christian Purslow may not want to leave Chelsea, where he heads their global commercial operation, having secured a £220million shirt sponsorship deal with Yokohama Rubber since arriving in October. It’s understood, though, that former Liverpool managing director Purslow is on the short-list to succeed George O’Grady as chief executive of golf’s European Tour. Twickenham, building up for the Rugby World Cup, have installed a football-style mixed zone which rugby players, far more approachable than their football counterparts, have to walk through while the media are kept behind ropes. Twickenham has introduced a mixed zone for rugby players, but how long before it becomes like football? Sadly, it can only be a matter of time before rugby players wear headphones or talk on their mobile to avoid being interviewed. Former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson has made a good start as manager of Chinese Super League side Shanghai East Asia, where he is understood to be earning as much as £6m a year. Eriksson is said to still need the money, after being swindled out of £10m by a crooked financial advisor and facing big demands from HMRC over tax from film investments.

"Need some help and inspiration deciding who to back at Cheltenham? Sportsmail's Peter Scudamore and Marcus Townend reveal their favourites while a group of racing enthusiast celebrities have also shared their tips for the Festival on day two. PETER SCUDAMORE - Eight-time champion jockey and rider of 13 Festival winners . BEAST OF BURDEN . (Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle, 1.30) This Rebecca Curtis-trained contender has long been on my radar and looks a horse of massive potential. Beaten over a shorter distance at Newbury over Christmas — his hurdling debut — but has won his other three races this season with great authority. BEST ODDS: 12-1 . Beast Of Burden winning the Excel Signs Novices' Hurdle Race at Bangor-on-Dee Races on February 6 . DON POLI . (RSA Chase, 2.05) One of the Irish hotpots of the week and looks a future Gold Cup contender. Won the Martin Pipe Conditional Novices’ Handicap Hurdle at last year’s meeting and has won his two races as a novice chaser. The most recent of those was his authoritative three-length defeat of the highly-rated Apache Stronghold in the Grade One Topaz Novices’ Chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. BEST ODDS: 6-4 . Don Poli, ridden by jockey Mikey Fogarty, winning the Conditional Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle last year . Racemail tipsters got off to a stunning start on the opening day. Robin Goodfellow (Sam Turner) and Captain Heath (Marcus Townend) napped 8-1 National Hunt Chase winner Cause Of Causes, while Townend also landed his next best bet (The Druids Nephew 8-1) to complete an 80-1 double. Turner also picked winners Douvan (2-1), Un De Sceaux (4-6) and Champion Hurdle winner Faugheen (4-5), while Peter Scudamore went for the first two Willie Mullins’ winners. BARADARI . (Coral Cup, 2.40) Rated by jockey Aidan Coleman (above) as one of his best chances of the meeting. His boss Venetia Williams has to be respected here and this contender looks like he still could be a touch in front of the handicapper. BEST ODDS: 16-1 . SIRE DE GRUGY . (Queen Mother Champion Chase, 3.20) Usually two quick runs might be a negative with the chance they have knocked the competitive edge of horse but Gary Moore’s reigning champion thrives on racing and there are very positive reports emanating from his Sussex stable as he prepares to defend his crown. He looks to have put his injury problems behind him judging by his last time out Chepstow win. Punters looking for a longer-priced each-way option should consider Simply Ned. BEST ODDS: 3-1 . Baradari (right) on the way to winning The Keltbray Holloway's Hurdle Race at Ascot on January 17, 2015 . MARCUS TOWNEND - on the best each-way bets . BARADARI . (Coral Cup, 2.40) Staying on really strongly when fifth in last year’s shorter Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle and was on the mark over two miles three furlongs at Ascot in December. That form has worked out well. This stiffer test looks likely to elicit even more improvement and he looks one of Venetia Williams’ best chances of the week. She won this in 2005 with Idole First. BEST ODDS: 16-1 . SOURIYAN . (Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle, 4.40) Lambourn trainer Jamie Snowden was successful on the opening day of last year’s meeting with Present View and, although that injured gelding has unfortunately not made it back the time, this stablemate looks a lively outsider. Has won only one of his three hurdle races but his two defeats should not be held against him, especially last time out on bottomless ground at Ffos Las. Has improvement in him. BEST ODDS: 25-1 . Modus ridden by Tom O'Brien winning the EBF Junior' Standard Open NH Flat Race at Cheltenham last year . MODUS . (Weatherbys Champion Bumper, 5.15) Eighth in this race last year and purposely saved for another crack at the prize by his Welsh trainer Robert Stephens. He reckons his contender is a much stronger more mature performer now so he can give the Irish, who dominate this race, a run for their money. BEST ODDS: 25-1 .

"Randy Gregory has admitted to failing a marijuana test at the NFL scouting combine last month. One of the most talented edge rushers in the upcoming draft, Gregory starred for Nebraska at outside linebacker for the past two seasons. 'I blame myself,' Gregory told NFL media's Kimberly Jones from his Atlanta home. 'And I know it sounds cliche, but there's really no one else I can blame.' The 22-year-old found out about the failed test a fortnight ago on the phone to his father. He had asked him to open an envelope which he mistakenly believed to be an invitation to the draft in Chicago. Randy Gregory impressed at the combine, running the 40 in 4.64 secs with a 125 inch broad jump . Gregory had 17.5 sacks in his two years at Nebraska and is one of the most coveted linebackers in the draft . Many experts have the 22-year-old as a top-five pick. At 6ft 5in he is versatile enough to rush the quarterback or operate in coverage, but in a class loaded with pass rushers, he spoke of his concerns. 'Am I worried? Yeah, I'm worried,' he said. 'At the same time, I'm confident. I know I'm going to be all right in the end.' Gregory told Jones that he hasn't smoked marijuana since December, and that he did not use other recreational drugs. 'I don't wake up every day saying, I'd really love to go smoke,' he said. 'It's not a struggle for me every day (now), it really isn't. In the past, hell yeah, it's been a struggle. It really has been.' Gregory's issues with the drug were well-documented. He failed two drug tests in January and April in 2014 at Nebraska. 'I was worse at Nebraska than I've ever been at any other time of my life. But I know how I am now. I think if teams really look at how I am now more so than the past, they'll see I'm making strides to get better, as a person and as a player,' he said. Despite the red flags, 29 NFL teams spoke to Gregory at the combine and if they did not know of his off-field issues, Gregory made them aware during the interviews. Gregory will enter the NFL in the first stage of the league's substance abuse programme. 'This incident right now is a step toward ending my career. The last thing I want to do is fail another drug test and be out of the league.'","Gregory starred for Nebraska over the past two seasons and was selected by many experts as a top five pick .

"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has conceded to being a worried man in the wake of Sebastian Vettel's Malaysian Grand Prix victory. Suggestions of another season of Mercedes domination in the wake of a comfortable one-two in the season-opening race in Australia were blown apart by Ferrari and Vettel in Malaysia. As Vettel himself noted, his triumph was achieved 'fair and square' as he beat reigning champion Lewis Hamilton by 8.5 seconds, with team-mate Nico Rosberg a further four seconds adrift in third. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff (right) was surprised by Sebastian Vettel's Malaysian Grand Prix victory . Despite searing heat of more than 30 degrees, Vettel's Ferrari was kinder on its tyres, stopping just twice compared to three for both Hamilton and Rosberg. It has left Wolff concerned, as he said: 'We were pretty sure the three-stop strategy would work for us. 'We probably went a bit too aggressive on set-up, which pushed us into a direction of a three-stop. Wolff admitted that the German driver deserved to win and Ferrari got their tactics spot-on in the soaring heat . Vettel celebrates after winning his first race of the season and opening up the Drivers Championship . 'But in the circumstances, with the high temperatures, they were able to go at a faster pace over long runs than us. 'We need to analyse why that was the case, and it clearly shows it's not going to be an easy one. 'It is clear they won the race, which is worrying. It wouldn't be right to say we lost it.' F1 stats provided by F1 Stat Blog . Vettel finished 8.5 seconds ahead of Hamilton (left) and 12.5 seconds ahead of Nico Rosberg . Wolff at least gave credit where it is due to Ferrari, although has also admitted to surprise at how quickly his team have been reeled in given their margin of victory in Australia. 'Ferrari deserved to win,' Wolff added. 'From a racing perspective, you have to acknowledge they have done a great development over the winter. 'For Formula One it (their win) is a positive, particularly after all the talk we had in Melbourne of a boring race and Mercedes running away with the championship. Hamilton had to pit three times in the race compared to Vettel's two and that was a major blow for him . 'It is what Formula One needed, but we didn't expect them to catch us this quickly. 'We were pretty dominant in Melbourne - we were a little bit sceptical about our own advantage. 'That we've been caught up by a Ferrari in two weeks, that they beat us fair and square on the track, is a bit of a surprise, but equally a bit of a wake up call, which is good for us. 'We just need to analyse in the next couple of days where we went wrong, what we need to improve, whether we need to bring any developments forward and put them on the car quicker. Rosberg (6) finished in third and continued his solid start to the Formula One season in Malaysia . 'Definitely we need to increase the pace of our development.' Wolff insists, though, Mercedes will not over-react to the situation, particularly as the cooler conditions at the next race in China in a fortnight are expected to favour his cars. 'There is no panic, but we are in a new situation,' he said. 'We were not in control of things. We had new information which was different to what we had assessed over the weekend. 'Things didn't pan out in the way we expected them to pan out, but it was clear the winning streak would not go on forever.' The German celebrates with his Ferrari team after winning the second Formula One race of the season . Suggested to Wolff the loss was the end of an era, he said: 'We must not be extreme in our assessment. 'In Melbourne there was extreme thinking we would win all season, and here we are two weeks later and we say is this the end of an era? 'It is not the end of an era - maybe the start of a new era, of a good battle, a battle we would like to take on. 'It's about staying calm, assessing, trying to return with confidence and with the speed we have had in the last couple of races.'","Mercedes boss Toto Wolff was surprised by Sebastian Vettel's victory .

The startling revelation comes despite Mr Cameron insisting that he could not understand 'why everyone is interested in the Kardashians' after being asked about his TV habits. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron has revealed he is the thirteenth cousin of the US celebrity Kim Kardashian . In an interview with the celebrity magazine Heat, Mr Cameron was asked if he watched Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Mr Cameron said: 'No, but I'm related to them.' But he added: 'Did you know I'm 13th cousins with them?'

"Freddy Ovett describes himself as ‘50-50’ British and Australian, though the soft Queensland accent seems a giveaway. It isn’t quite as simple as that, because Freddy is the son of Steve, 1980 Olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of British sport, whose rivalry with Sebastian Coe captivated a global audience. Three decades on, Freddy is forging his own path — but as a cyclist, not a runner, having switched sports 18 months ago and made such rapid progress that he has trained with Chris Froome, the 2013 Tour de France winner, and recently signed with France’s top development team. Cyclist Freddy Ovett is all smiles as poses for a picture with his former athlete father Steve Ovett . Ovett Jnr spent his first seven years in Dumfriesshire, where his parents moved after Steve’s retirement, and where his father competed in the odd cycle race until he collided with a car in 1994 — by coincidence, the year Freddy was born. Freddy knows little about his father’s brief cycling career, and laughs as he says: ‘I can imagine him rocking up, thinking he was stronger than anyone.’ But he knows everything about his running: ‘My depth of knowledge about the history of athletics is more than my dad’s. I have to correct him sometimes on what he did and didn’t do.’ Freddy and his father Steve hit the running track, somewhere Steve is very familiar with . Father and son are cut from the same cloth. ‘We’re so, so close, and so similar,’ he says. That augurs well for Freddy and badly for opponents, since the older Ovett, now 59, was famously competitive. He was equally famously prickly with the press — a trait that doesn’t seem to have been inherited by the genial, open Ovett Jnr. Had social media existed in the 1980s, it’s difficult to imagine Steve asking a journalist to publish his Twitter handle (it’s @freddyovett, since you ask). Freddy recently signed with France’s top development team after swapping running trainers for a bike . Freddy was a promising middle-distance runner, just like his dad, and in 2012 won a scholarship to the University of Oregon. Then he suffered a knee injury. ‘It was so frustrating. I came back to Australia and did a bit of cycling to keep in shape,’ he says. Tests at the Victorian Institute of Sport suggested he had promise. ‘I think I was meant to be a cyclist all along,’ Freddy says. ‘I always followed it, I was always staying up to stupid hours watching the Tour de France. It fascinated me, despite the scandals. I was a big fan of Lance Armstrong before the whole downfall.’ MEDALS: 800m Olympic gold, 1500m bronze (1980); 1500m European gold (1978); 800m European silver (1974, 1978); 5,000m Commonwealth gold (1986). WORLD RECORDS . Ran a 3:48.8 mile in 1980 to beat Seb Coe’s record . Battled with Coe for the mile record in 1981 — it changed hands three times in nine days . Set three 1500m records between 1980 and 1983 . Set a two mile record in 1978 that lasted nine years . Ovett was also BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1978 . What did his father make of him turning his back on running? ‘When I started cycling, we weren’t speaking,’ says Freddy. ‘It was a strange time, it lasted about a year, which was tough on both of us.’ His parents are divorced and while his mother is still in Noosa, Queensland, his father lives down in Melbourne with his new partner. ‘When I went to Europe last year, my dad and I got back in contact,’ Freddy continues. ‘He sees the way athletics is at the moment and he saw how difficult it was for me to break through. ‘He’s super supportive about my cycling — and excited more than anything. When I speak to him I can sense that.’ Freddy has a lot to live up to if he wants similar levels of success as his father Steve . One of the challenges in athletics, says Ovett Jnr, is dealing with doping, which — surprisingly — he thinks is worse in his original sport than in his new one. ‘Cycling has taken more of an aggressive approach in trying to stamp it out,’ he claims. ‘In athletics, a lot of dodgy stuff is going on that the general public are not aware of, because they’re not knowledgeable enough.’ Freddy, 21, is based in Chambery in the Alps, in an apartment owned by his new team, AG2R. They are as French as cycling teams come, but manager, Vincent Lavenu, a top rider in the 1980s, was interested in a rider called Ovett. ‘He was a fan of my dad’s,’ says Freddy. Steve Cram and Ovett during the heats of the Men's 1500 metres event at the Summer Olympics in 1984 . He shares an apartment with a French rider and a chef comes in to cook lunch and dinner. The team is paying for French classes — he goes to school for three hours a day. The question of his nationality is unresolved. Enquiries were made about him riding for Scotland at last year’s Commonwealth Games, but he is undecided. ‘I have dual citizenship. I don’t want to rush anything,’ he explains. He is wary of declaring for Britain or Australia when he feels he hasn’t proved himself deserving of a place in either national team. Steve was a 1980 Olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of British sport . ‘I need to learn in Under 23 racing before trying to be a hero,’ he says. ‘But I’m definitely not opposed to representing the UK.’ What does his dad think? ‘I don’t know, he’s good at letting me feel my own way. He’s trying to not put too much pressure on me. Both (British and Australian) set-ups are really good — both have incredibly strong national teams.’ Last year, during his first racing trip to Europe, Ovett stayed with his agent, Baden Cooke, in Monaco, which is also where Froome and his Sky team-mate Richie Porte live. Freddy, 21, is based in Chambery in the Alps, in an apartment owned by his new team, AG2R . ‘It was fantastic,’ says Ovett. ‘I went on quite a few rides with Richie and got on really well with him — he checks up on me. And I rode with Chris, including one ride where he was training for the Vuelta. I learned so much. ‘He is such a nice guy and I read a bit about him — he is like this African Maasai warrior, extremely talented but he couldn’t get a handle on how to race. ‘I don’t compare myself with him but I can relate to that. I feel strong enough to make up for my poor bunch racing skills, but I know I’ve got so much to learn.’ Freddy was a promising middle-distance runner and in 2012 won a scholarship to the University of Oregon .","Freddy Ovett is the son of 1980 Olympic 800 metres gold medallist Steve .

"Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart has praised Kevin Pietersen's 'outstanding' character, but admitted the batsman's chances of an England return are slim. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey to play in LV= County Championship Division Two in a bid to win a Test recall for the Ashes this summer. The 34-year-old was sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash, but Stewart revealed he has never had any problems with his attitude. Kevin Pietersen has been hailed for his 'outstanding character' by Surrey chief Alec Stewart . Pietersen shared a picture of himself celebrating Australia's World Cup win with James Faulkner . Surrey cricket director Stewart (right) can't see a way back for Pietersen with England . 'He's been as good as gold with us. If he was a bad character we wouldn't have had him,' he said on BBC Radio 5 Live. 'Whenever he's been with us he has been outstanding. He's helped the youngsters, he's been in the nets, he's put on batting clinics and he's tried his heart out. So hopefully, and I have no reason to disbelieve, he will be exactly the same this time, if not even more hard working and desperate to score runs.' Stewart accepted, though, that Pietersen's hopes of playing for England again were likely to be dashed. Pietersen was axed by England following the controversial whitewash by Australia in last year's Ashes . Test captain Alastair Cook (left) admits an England recall is unlikely for the Surrey batsman . ECB managing director Paul Downton has been steadfast in his appraisal that Pietersen will not come back - as have national selector James Whitaker and coach Peter Moores, while Test captain Alastair Cook rated the prospect 'highly unlikely'. 'If England are winning, they have a good West Indies tour which we expect, then it's going to take an injury or a huge loss of form for a vacancy to become available,' Stewart added. 'But all Kevin can do and, that's what he's said to us, he's going to score runs, sit back and see what happens.'","Kevin Pietersen has joined Surrey in bid to win England recall for Ashes .

"Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has hailed Sebastian Vettel's Malaysian Grand Prix victory as a 'classic' performance. Horner and Red Bull were forced to bid farewell to Vettel at the end of last season as the 27-year-old decided to pursue his dream of driving for Ferrari. Despite winning four world titles and 39 grands prix with the Milton Keynes-based marque, Vettel felt the time was right to try pastures new. Sebastian Vettel celebrates emerging victorious at the Malaysian Grand Prix with Ferrari on Sunday . Red Bull team principal Christian Horner praised Vettel's performance, saying 'he drove brilliantly' Vettel celebrates taking victory in his Ferrari in the immediate aftermath of the Malaysian Grand Prix . On the back of his triumph at the Sepang International Circuit, it would appear to be an inspired move as Red Bull are floundering, whilst Ferrari are clearly back with a bang. Acknowledging Vettel's display, Horner said: 'On a personal note it's great to see him win. I'm pleased for him. He looked a happy chap. 'I thought he drove brilliantly. It was classic Vettel. He got his head down at the front, managed the tyres and managed to make a two-stop strategy work. 'The Ferrari did look very gentle on its tyres in the heat and temperature (33 degrees centigrade). 'Seb has clearly got a good feel in the car, it has good driveability and he's very good at looking after the tyres, and in that situation he is quite often unbeatable.' Looking at the bigger picture, Horner added: 'Although it wasn't a great day for us, it was at least a good day for Formula One in that in a straight race Ferrari managed to beat Mercedes.' The start to the new season has so far been disastrous for Red Bull for after complaining vociferously about power-unit supplier Renault after the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, it was brake issues that proved the team's undoing in Malaysia. Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo could only manage ninth and 10th respectively, even finishing behind the rookie pairing from 'sister' team Toro Rosso in Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr who were seventh and eighth. Holding up Ferrari's turnaround as an example of what can be achieved, Horner added: 'They have done a good job. 'It demonstrates everything is possible, and shows how things can change quite quickly. 'We just have to focus on our issues and address them in the forthcoming races because we had a very tough afternoon. F1 stats provided by F1 Stat Blog . Daniil Kvyat was Red Bull's highest finisher in Malaysia, crossing the line in ninth position . Horner wants his Red Bull team to use Ferrari as an example of the level of turnaround that can happen . 'As soon as we started to run into traffic, temperatures started to get out of control, in particular managing the brakes, and then we didn't really have any pace. 'It was then about trying to manage our race to make sure we got to the end, so a frustrating afternoon really. 'We need to go away and understand some of the issues from the weekend and make sure we address them, hopefully in time for the next race in China.'","Christian Horner says Sebastian Vettel's Malaysia display was 'classic'

"Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Jessica Ennis-Hill’s burgeoning rivalry has all the ingredients to propel athletics into the spotlight in a similar manner to the Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett clashes which captivated sports fans in the 1980s. ‘They could have a rivalry like Steve and I had,’ said Lord Coe. ‘Head-to-heads are what get people excited. My kids got up at the weekend to watch Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. The more opportunities we have for athletes going head-to-head, the better. It’s what people talk about. ‘It’s actually not just the thought of Jess and Kat but you have Morgan Lake, too, coming through and I’m sure she will be equally good. It’s an extraordinary period to be entering.’ Katarina Johnson-Thompson won the World Indoor's in Prague, Czech Republic to become world No 1 . Jessica Ennis-Hill is the Olympic Champion and her future rivalry with Johnson-Thompson is 'exciting' Johnson-Thompson, 22, is the World’s No 1 hept-athlete and broke Ennis-Hill’s British record at the European Indoor Championships in Prague this month. Her blistering form — coupled with murmurs from the Ennis-Hill camp that her training for a comeback after the birth of son Reggie is going very well — has set the scene for a mouthwatering duel. The pair are understandably keen to play down talk of a rivalry, Johnson-Thompson out of reverence for the Olympic champion of whom she claims to be ‘in awe’ and Ennis-Hill because she is unsure what competitive shape she will be in. But those charged with promoting the sport are keen to make the most of the fact that Britain boasts the world’s two leading multi-eventers. They were expected to compete against each other for the first time since London 2012 — when Johnson-Thompson was 15th — at the Hypo-Meeting at the end of May, when the world’s leading heptathletes descend on the Austrian alpine town Gotzis. But Brendan Foster revealed to Sportsmail that he is trying to set up a head-to-head for earlier that month at the Great CityGames in Manchester. Lord Sebastian Coe wants the heptathletes to have an exciting duel like he did with Steve Ovett in the 1980s . ‘Kat has already agreed to do the 200 metres hurdles and long jump,’ said Foster. ‘Jess was invited to take part in the same events and soundings are favourable from her. ‘With heptathlon they might only battle it out twice a year but if sport in Britain is to benefit from the rivalry that is going to be inevitable between these two then they should compete against each other a couple more times head-to-head in one, two or three events. It’s in their interests and very much in the sport’s interest.’ Both Johnson-Thompson and Ennis-Hill, 29, have the World Championships in Beijing this summer as their primary aim and will probably be joined by 17-year-old Lake, who has surpassed anything either of them achieved at the same age. Johnson-Thompson and Ennis-Hill are friends off the track despite the well speculated competition . Lord Coe and Ovett were great rivals in the 80s and provided huge entertainment for the athletics world . With 12 years spanning their ages the three are unlikely ever to stand on the podium together but Lord Coe thinks that they can transform the image of a sport that increasingly seems to command the spotlight only when a new doping scandal emerges. ‘Those three can really help engage, particularly with young girls where the challenge is to get them involved in sport,’ he said. ‘Stars like Kat and Jess are important for the sport. They are from normal backgrounds, they haven’t come out of some kind of super-schools, they are like the kids next door and that is really important so that people can identify with them.’ The Morrisons Great Newham London Run takes place on Sunday, July 19 and gives you the chance to run on the track and cross the finish line in the Olympic Stadium.

"Holland beat Spain 2-0 in a friendly on Tuesday to earn embattled coach Guus Hiddink some breathing space after a poor start to his second term in charge of the national team. Centre back Stefan de Vrij and midfielder Davy Klaassen scored first-half goals in the morale-boosting victory. Spain, thrashed 5-1 by Holland at the World Cup, never looked like gaining revenge thanks to a combination of bad finishing and good goalkeeping by Kenneth Vermeer.

It was a double celebration for De Vrij (left), Daley Blind (centre) and Bruno Martins Indi as they celebrated 25 caps for the Holland team .

Referee: William Collum (Scotland) Hiddink's second stint as coach has been disastrous so far. In seven matches ahead of Tuesday's friendly, his team had beaten only Kazakhstan and Latvia in European qualifiers and lost to Italy, the Czech Republic, Iceland and Mexico in qualifiers and friendlies. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque, missing Chelsea striker Diego Costa, fielded an experimental side at the Amsterdam Arena, while Hiddink again had to make do without his injured stars Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben and was also missing center back Ron Vlaar. The veteran coach made five changes to the team that needed an extra-time equaliser on Saturday to salvage a 1-1 draw against Turkey that left Holland third in Euro 2016 qualifying Group A. Scorer De Vrij had a double celebration as he, along with Daley Blind and Bruno Martins Indi, marked their 25th cap. Blind posted a picture of the trio on Instagram with the message: 'Happy with the win against Spain! What a result! Also proud of my achievement; 25 caps for the Dutch squad! Congrats to @stefandevrij3 and @brunomartinsindi.' After the game, Dutch captain Wesley Sneijder said: ''We had a point to prove after the match against Turkey and we did that well.' De Vrij gave Holland the lead in the 13th minute when he headed in a cross from Sneijder after Spain only half-cleared a corner. Ajax midfielder Klaassen scored his first international goal to double the Dutch lead three minutes later when he slipped away from Santi Cazorla and fired a shot that David de Gea parried before Klaassen hammered in the rebound. Vermeer preserved the lead with two good saves around the half-hour mark as Spain pressed forward. First the Feyenoord keeper advanced off his line to deny a rushing Gerard Pique and two minutes later scrambled to swat away the ball after Pedro had dispossessed Bruno Martins Indi. Willems, brought in to left back to provide more attacking options, looked vulnerable early, giving away the ball twice in dangerous positions before providing the assist for Klaassen's goal. 'We have to learn from those mistakes where we shot ourselves in the foot,' Hiddink said. Goalscorer De Vrij slides in on Spain midfielder Mario Suarez during the first half on Tuesday evening .

In between, Martins Indi missed a simple chance to put the match beyond Spain's reach when he headed a Sneijder cross into the ground and over the bar from close range.

"It is almost a full month now since the despised old regime at Rangers was routed in the battle for control of Ibrox. But the influence of ex-chief executive Derek Llambias continues to be felt in the Blue Room as the new board of directors stumble across a series of strategically-placed landmines. One particularly nasty surprise exploded into the public domain on Tuesday as it emerged the price of promotion to the Premiership for Rangers will include an extra £500,000 payable to Mike Ashley. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley will be laughing all the way to the bank if Rangers win promotion . Ashley will receive payment for the loan of five Newcastle players including Haris Vuckic (centre), Gael Bigirimana (left) and Remie Streete . That sizeable sum is in return for Ashley loaning the Ibrox club five of his Newcastle United players; four of whom turned out to be either injured, ill or unfit. Of course, the long-suffering Rangers fans have grown wearily accustomed to their club being treated with contempt while ruthless businessman Ashley lines his pockets. The support have witnessed the Newcastle United owner’s placemen sell the naming rights to their beloved Ibrox for just £1 – albeit Ashley subsequently gave up those rights amid a backlash from the rank and file. They then watched in disbelief as a deal was sanctioned with the billionaire’s Sports Direct firm that sees just 75 pence of every £10 spent on Rangers merchandise going to the club. But Tuesday's revelation in the club’s latest accounts is perhaps the most depressing example of the callous regard in which the outgoing board viewed the Ibrox club. In a scenario that’s being viewed at Rangers as ‘vindictive, it’s believed that Rangers’ own medical staff were overruled by Llambias when they insisted on medicals for the five loan Rangers. Had that happened, Rangers would have found Remie Streete and Shane Ferguson were in no state to play while Kevin Mbabu was patently unfit. Streete duly limped off 45 minutes into his debut after Llambias had ordered caretaker manager Kenny McDowall to start him. Proper testing would also have shown that Gael Bigirimana was ill, with a condition that had already been diagnosed by medics at Newcastle. Vuckic has been the only player loaned from Newcastle that has been a success at Ibrox . 20-year-old defender Streete suffered an injury in his one and only first-team appearance for Rangers . Of the five loan Rangers, midfielder Haris Vuckic has been the sole success - but campaigning Rangers fan Craig Houston says the situation jars when he recalls the sale of star player Lewis Macleod to Brentford in January. ‘That was done on the pretext they were protecting the future of Rangers,’ said Houston of the Sons of Struth supporters group. ‘But I believe they only got £250,000 for Macleod and then they shell out £500,000 for five loan players. ‘Macleod would add more to the team than Vuckic. And I would rather have Lewis at Ibrox on a permanent basis – increasing his value – than all five Newcastle loan players, even if they were all fit.’ New Rangers chairman Paul Murray recently held up the decision by Llambias and his then finance director, the Sports Direct executive Barry Leach, to spend £300,000 on an EGM - when it was clear the old board was finished – as examples of the financial madness that has plagued Rangers since liquidation. And yet another landmine was stumbled upon as it emerged auditors Deloitte had informed the previous board of their intention to resign last June. Defensive midfielder Bigirimana has been ruled out of action for Rangers with a mystery illness . Not only did the previous board fail to announce this, or seek a replacement, they inexplicably included the reappointment of Deloitte on their resolution notice in November for the following month’s AGM. ‘It’s just another example of the deplorable mismanagement at Rangers, or of people burying their heads in the sand,’ said Houston. ‘The resolution was passed in December but Deloittes were long gone as auditors.’ As Rangers revealed losses after tax of £2.89million for the six-month period to 31 December 2014, the accounts reiterated two Emphasis of Matter warnings outlined in full-year accounts signed off by Deloitte relating to the company’s ability to trade as a going concern. But new chairman Paul Murray confirmed Sportsmail’s exclusive that the club is planning a rights issue in the summer to raise funds - believed to be £10m – to sustain the club in the medium and long term. In his statement, Murray said the club would become ‘self-sustaining’ and ‘free from the kind of funding crises that have plagued Rangers in recent years.’ He vowed that, under the new board, the Ibrox club would be back competing at the top level at home and in Europe by 2022 - in time for the 50th anniversary of the club’s 1972 European Cup Winners’ Cup triumph in Barcelona. Stuart McCall is a 'strong candidate' to extend his position as Rangers boss beyond the end of the season . Describing interim boss Stuart McCall as a ‘strong candidate’ for the permanent position, Murray called on fans to back his board by investing in season tickets. He said: ‘The vision is to focus on the next seven years so that by 2022, the club’s 150th anniversary and the 50th anniversary of Barcelona, we, Rangers, will be back at the very top. ‘Over the next few years the finance we are putting in place now will provide the infrastructure and personnel at Murray Park to make sure Rangers are competing and winning in Scotland’s top flight as well as stepping back into the European arenas again. ‘Then for the three or four years after that all our efforts will be directed towards making Rangers stronger and European regulars as our 150th year approaches. That year should be one of celebration. ‘A massive rebuild is required at every level and in every department of this huge club of ours and we cannot and will not shy away from those tasks. ‘After years of mismanagement we need patience and support. We must never forget what has happened to our club in the last four years. The new board will ensure that it never happens again. This is our Club, we have taken ownership of it and with our 2022 vision we will not fail.’","Mike Ashley will receive £500,000 if Rangers are promoted to Premiership .
The fee is payment for the loan of five Newcastle players to the Ibrox club .

"Rangers are determined to exhaust every possible avenue in a bid to avoid paying Newcastle United £500,000 for the five loan players sent north under the instructions of Derek Llambias. The small print of the deal emerged on Monday as the club posted half-yearly losses of £2.89million. The accounts also revealed the new board are still searching for a nominated advisor (NOMAD) to avoid being de-listed on the Stock Exchange - and that the club's auditors Deloitte quit in June in a move that was not revealed by the previous regime. Gael Bigirimana (left), Haris Vuckic (middle) and Remie Streete (right) pose after their loan moves to Rangers . Interim chairman Paul Murray described that as a sign of the 'staggering mismanagement' that had gone on at Ibrox. But fans have been left aghast at the stunning revelation that should Rangers win promotion through the play-offs this season they will have to fork out £500,000 to Newcastle . Of the loanees, only Haris Vuckic has seen regular first-team action while Remie Streete was injured in his only top-team appearance. Shane Ferguson, Gael Bigirimana and Kevin Mbabu are unlikely to ever appear as they battle back from either illness or injury. 'It's another kick in the teeth for Rangers fans,' said Craig Houston, of the campaigning Rangers supporters group Sons of Struth. 20-year-old defender Streete suffered an injury in his one and only first-team appearance for Rangers . 'I think it's right for the board to pursue this. I have faith in the guys running Rangers now and this is not the only deal they will be trying to unfold and unravel. 'But it's a bit of a cheek. Derek Llambias sold the idea as these five costing Rangers no money. But we've since found out there's £1,000 to be paid each per week, and it's my belief the club is paying for rental property, too. Now we find out about this lump sum if we are promoted. 'The night the transfers went through, we saw the players leaving Newcastle but nobody saw them arrive at Murray Park prior to signing. 'We've been questioning for a while the ridiculous decision to not give them medicals. Had they done that, it would show two were injured and would probably never pull on a blue jersey and a third was ill and couldn't play football.' The controversial deal was struck by the club's previous board led by chief executive Llambias – a cohort of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley. Sportsmail understands however that the new board are now set to approach the Scottish FA and their English counterpart as they seek advice on whether there are grounds for quashing the £500,000 payment clause. The bombshell that Rangers – who would earn just £342,000 for finishing second in the league – would have to shell out the cash to Newcastle if they are promoted emerged as the Ibrox club released 'disappointing' financial results. Interim chairman Murray railed against the previous regime after announcing the near £3m loss for the six months to December last year. Vuckic is the only one of the five Newcastle loanees to have held down a regular starting spot at Irbox . The 22-year-old Slovenian midfielder has scored four goals in just eight league games for Rangers . Despite promotion to the Championship, Rangers' revenue fell £100,000 to £13.1m, though the club earned £1.3m from hosting the Commonwealth Games rugby sevens. Sponsorship revenue also dropped, falling by £0.3m to £0.4m. Rangers have until Saturday to appoint a new nominated advisor (NOMAD) or face being de-listed from the stock market although it's believed an extension will be sought to that deadline. Murray, who along with Dave King and John Gilligan ousted the previous board led by Llambias, said he was confident Rangers can overcome their difficulties. He said: 'The new directors have been in place only a matter of weeks but have already started to repair the damage caused through recent years of neglect and disrespect for this club, its people and its history. 'The mismanagement of the club in recent years has been simply staggering. 'As the Interim Accounts prove, the new board has inherited major problems but while campaigning for change we all knew the club would be in need of major restructuring and repair on all fronts. 'We can and we will return this club to a strong and profitable footing through strategic planning, investment and re-engagement with all of our stakeholders. 'Too many of them have been lost or disenfranchised because of successive failings by a series of directors over the last four years in particular. But they are gone now and this is a new era for this great and special club which must be regenerated, not only for its own good but for the greater good of Scottish football.'

"Paul Murray admits the new Rangers regime is still waiting to see whether Mike Ashley will send two of his men onto the board. The Ibrox interim chairman confirmed the terms of the initial £5million loan taken from Sports Direct by the previous hierarchy means Ashley retains the right to appoint directors. Murray insists Rangers now have no need for any further money from the Newcastle United owner, having this week instead secured a £1.5m loan from the Three Bears consortium to cover short-term needs. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley holds an eight per cent stake in Rangers and loaned the club £5m . However, he hopes to have talks with Ashley once a wider review of existing commercial deals with Sports Direct – who own 75 per cent of the club’s retail subsidiary – is complete. ‘We’ve had no discussions with Mike Ashley or Sports Direct so far but, as we have said before, we are happy to engage with them and feel we should do,’ Murray told Rangers TV. ‘They are an eight per cent shareholder and have financial arrangements with the club. We need to have that conversation pretty soon, but as yet we’ve had no discussions with them. ‘Mike Ashley does have the right to nominate two board members. It would be to the main public company, the International Football Club, and he has got rights under the first £5m loan to do that. ‘He’s showed no intention of doing it so far but he has the right to do it if he wants to - and we’d have to address that if and when he chooses to do that. Interim chairman Paul Murray (left) will have discussions with Ashley about his involvement at Ibrox . ‘I think, as Dave King was saying, one of the big information-gathering exercises was to look at the whole relationship between Sports Direct and the club. ‘There are a lot of relationships and there is a lot of documentation to go with those and we have spent the last three weeks looking at all of that. ‘We haven’t finished that review yet. I think once we have done that we will sit down, hopefully with Sports Direct and Mike Ashley, and try and agree a way forward.’ King has held off from becoming a director but intends to step into the chairman’s role providing he passes the SFA’s 'fit and proper’ person test. ‘The processes regarding both mine and Dave’s fit and proper persons test are pretty advanced,’ added Murray. Prospective chairman Dave King (right) has to pass the SFA’s ‘fit and proper’ person test . ‘We have said, and we will honour the fact, that we want to rebuild the relationship with all the governing bodies and we have to respect their processes and procedures.’ Murray also insisted he wants to help build a ‘modern Rangers upon traditional foundations’. He said: ‘People have spoken about having Rangers men on the board and getting back to a Rangers way of doing things but I think we also need to be a bit more forward-thinking. ‘I am looking a lot at this moment at the structure of various clubs and trying to get a sense of what would work at Rangers because there are different structures around Europe and even in Britain. ‘For example, the structure at Barcelona might not be appropriate for the structure at Rangers and we need to look at that kind of thing.’","Rangers took a £5million loan from Sports Direct to help cover costs .

The Ballon d'Or winner was released from international duty ahead of this friendly meeting at the Estadio Antonio Coimbra da Mota and Portugal dearly missed his guile and killer instinct.

It was the first time since 1986 that Portugal had lost to an African nation, though it shouldn't come as too much a surprise with Cape Verde up at 37 in the FIFA world rankings, above the likes of Scotland and Sweden. Cape Verde made a lively start but the European side began to stamp their mark on proceedings soon after Vozinha was called into action on a number of occasions in goal, keeping out Vierinha and then Bernardo Silva. But the visitors were in front in the 38th minute, as  Fortes' cross-cum-shot looped over Lopes at the far post. Five minutes later they doubled their advantage after Heldon's free-kick fell kindly for Gege, who made his way up from defence and could hardly miss. Hugo Almeida spurned a golden chance in the second half as Fernando Santos' side tried to rally, but Portugal's hopes of mounting a comeback were dealt a major blow on the hour mark when Pinto was shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge on Heldon. Pinto's sending off did not affect Portugal's attacking ambition, but their efforts ultimately proved fruitless on a famous night for Cape Verde.

"Ireland captain Will Porterfield accused the International Cricket Council of 'shutting doors in the face' of associate nations with their plans to reduce the 2019 World Cup to 10 teams. The 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand featured 14 teams but the ICC are pressing ahead with plans to streamline the tournament in four years time, a move that Porterfield condemned. The Ireland captain suggested there was no point in associate nations continuing if the ICC decide to run a 'members only' club and make more money for the elite nations. The 30-year-old told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'It's frustrating when we keep doing everything that's asked of us by the ICC, and then they keep slapping you in the face with decisions like this. Ireland captain Will Porterfield blasted the ICC's decision to reduce the next World Cup to 10 teams . Ireland came close to reaching the quarter-finals of the World Cup and beat West Indies in the group stage . 'Cutting teams is not the way forward. It's only full members, pretty much, they're giving the opportunities to - it may as well be a members' cup, as opposed to a World Cup. 'It's a decision that not only I but a lot of other people completely disagree with. If you look at any other sport around the world, they're looking to expand and develop. The way the ICC are going, they don't seem to be doing that really. 'I think how we've done, and what we've shown over the last few years, merits a place at the World Cup. But the ICC just seem to be shutting doors in your face really. 'It's almost getting to the stage of ""What's the point?"" for a lot of the teams. If you keep closing the door, they can't get on to the world stage. Kevin O'Brien's century helped Ireland stun England at the 2011 World Cup in Bangalore, India . 'I'd like to know what Dave Richardson's (ICC chief executive) vision for the game is. It's not just Ireland here - we're talking about a global game. 'This is the International Cricket Council. If his vision for the game is to shrink it and make as much money for the top few nations as possible, then come out and say that.' Ireland narrowly missed out on a place in the quarter-finals of this World Cup when they were beaten by Pakistan in their decisive group game in Adelaide. Porterfield's side won three of their first four matches in the tournament including victories over the West Indies and Zimbabwe before falling short against India and Pakistan. Ireland advanced to the super-eight stage of the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean after beating Pakistan . Their impressive performances at this tournament follow their win over Pakistan in Jamaica in 2007 and against England in Bangalore in 2011. Before the current World Cup, their last ODI against an elite nation was against Sri Lanka in Dublin in May 2014. Ireland are also due to play England and Australia in one-off matches this summer. Porterfield added: 'The last four years between World Cups, we've played nine games against top-10 teams. Even if we'd won every single game we played, we still can't break in - so that's what we're up against.'","ICC plan to reduce 2019 World Cup to 10 teams down from 14 .

"Suresh Raina hit an unbeaten 110 as India defeated Zimbabwe by six-wickets to ensure they finished the group stages unbeaten. Earlier, Brendan Taylor had hit an impressive 138 in his final match for Zimbabwe before moving to England to play for county side Nottinghamshire as a Kolpak player. However, the 29-year-old was denied a fairytale ending by Raina and MS Dohni as the reigning champions were pushed hard to ensure they kept up their winning momentum. Suresh Raina of India celebrates after scoring a century during India's victory against Zimbabwe on Saturday . Raina waves his bat in celebration as captain MS Dhoni congratulates his team-mate . Despite being an emotional day for Taylor, who had spoken about his sadness at leaving the international stage, he became the first Zimbabwean player ever to hit back-to-back World Cup centuries. And, on a record-breaking day Taylor passed his mentor Alistair Campbell for the most one-day international hundreds scored with his eighth ton. For India, they passed their first real test as they stretched their World Cup winning streak to 10 – behind only Australia on 25. On a green wicket, batting first always seemed like the ideal option but having won the toss Dhoni said he wanted his side to be tested and face a chase, so chose to bowl. It seemed unlikely that Dhoni was going to be granted his wish as his consistently impressive trio of fast bowlers, Mohammad Shami, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma, each took an early wicket to reduce Zimbabwe to 33-3. Plenty of supporters were still finding their way into Eden Park when a fuller Yadav delivery caught the outside edge of Hamilton Masakadza’s bat (2) and Dohni took a low catch behind the stumps. Raina's unbeaten 110 earned him the Player of the Match trophy as India kept up 100 per cent record . Zimbabwe skipper Brendan Taylor hit an impressive 138 in his final international match . Six balls later Chamu Chibhabha (7) followed his fellow opener back into the hut as he sent a thick edge into the hand of Shihkar Dhawan in the slips off the bowling of Shami. And when Solomon Mire was caught behind off Mohit for a turgid nine from 22-balls, Zimbabwe looked to be buckling against the world champions. However, it arguably brought Zimbabwe’s two best batsmen, Taylor and Sean Williams, to the crease and together they rebuilt their side’s innings. The pair shared a 93-run fourth wicket partnership as both batsman battled against each other to reach their half-centuries first, with the chase won by captain Taylor. Williams (50) followed suit the very next ball but then fell tamely has he attempted to whack the ball hard past bowler Ravichandran Ashwin only to be caught sharply by the spinner. Taylor though wasn’t willing to leave the international stage without a personal milestone and he found a willing partner in Craig Ervine to help him to his ton. Taylor takes his helmet off as he celebrates his second successive century . As the wicketkeeper-batsman passed 73 he became the highest Zimbabwean run-maker in a World Cup, surpassing Neil Johnson’s 367 in 1999, finally finishing with 405 runs for the campaign. And, after reaching the all-important three figures Taylor exploded, smashing one Ravindra Jadeja over for 24 runs. However, he departed in the next over as he lofted the ball to Dhawan at mid-off off Mohit for an impressive 138 off 110 balls. Congratulated by many of the Indian players, Taylor walked off to a standing ovation by the 30,000 strong crowd. Zimbabwe’s progress could easily have been stunted by their loss of regular wickets but their deep batting line-up continued to impress as they regularly cleared the ropes. India’s spinners, Ashwin and Jadeja, who were seen pre-World Cup as their main bowling threat, disappeared for a collective 1-146 from their 20 overs. Taylor is congratulated by India batsman Raina - who would go on to win the match for the champions . A quick-fire 28 from Sikandar Raza helped propel Zimbabwe to 287 all out but India’s supposedly weak bowling line-up bowled out their sixth side in six matches. Buoyed by Taylor’s exceptional innings Zimbabwe strode confidently out on to the field after the innings break. Despite Tinashe Panyangara’s first over going for nine runs India struggled to get the ball away early on. The pressure of tight bowling and a build-up of dot balls saw the dangerous Rohit Sharma (16) attempt to drive a length ball from the right-arm bowler only to be caught by a back-pedaling Raza at cover. Dhawan departed just four balls later as Panyangara’s shattered his stumps to silence the shocked crowd, to give the bowler a double-wicket maiden. Zimbabwe have conceded on average just 3.25 runs in the first powerplay, the lowest of all 14 teams, and India struggled to 35-2 at the end of 10 overs. Dhoni embraces century-scorer Raina as India made it 10 wins in a row in World Cup matches . With their side struggling Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane shared a 50-run partnership before the latter was run-out as he attempted to test fielder at cover and failed. Zimbabwe were all over India and reduced them 92-4 as Kohli attempted to sweep Raza round the corner and was bowled for 38. With the run-rate creeping up Raina and Dohni continued to find it hard to get the ball away but the turning point in match came when Raina was dropped by Hamilton Masakadza on 47. It was a hugely costly error as the-28-year-old went on to score his hundred off just 94 balls, having hit seven fours and four sixes. And, for the ninth one-day international match of his career Dhoni (77 not out) ended the match by sending the ball clear past the ropes for six with eight balls remaining. Admittedly it was a disappointing end for Zimbabwe, who’s future once again looks unclear with the lost of one of their greatest players, whilst India’s march towards a second consecutive World Cup title continues at pace.","India beat Zimbabwe by six wickets at in Auckland, New Zealand .

"Outnumbered but definitely not outgunned. Trainer Mark Bradstock should adopt it as his stable motto. The Oxfordshire trainer will certainly be hoping that is the case when Coneygree bids to become the first novice to win the £550,000 Betfred Gold Cup since Captain Christy in 1974. Talk of such lofty ambition started after Bradstock and his assistant trainer wife, Sara, saw Coneygree stroll home by 40 lengths in the Kauto Star Novices’ Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day in only his second steeplechase. Oxfordshire trainer Mark Bradstock's Coneygree will b out to make history in the Betfred Gold Cup on Friday . Coneygree is running to be the first novice to win the £550,000 Betfred Gold Cup since Captain Christy in 1974 . Proof the performance was not a fluke came when Coneygree slammed Hennessy Gold Cup runner-up Houblon Des Obeaux by seven lengths in Newbury’s Denman Chase on February 7. Part of the credit for Coneygree’s performances has been shared with son Alfie. He is pursuing a showjumping career under the guidance of former international Graham Fletcher and regularly tutors Coneygree over the poles. Bradstock, who spent 12 years as assistant to legendary trainer Fulke Walwyn, said: ‘Coneygree’s strength is an incredibly high cruising speed and being able to efficiently jump at that speed, when most can’t. 'For a small stable like us to even have a runner at the Festival is fantastic, let alone a fancied one. ‘But I never feel like an underdog. We can put it up the bigger stables, even with their £250,000 horses, as 99 per cent of our horses are front-runners — they are fit and know how to jump.’ Coneygree won the Kauto Star Novices’ Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day in just his second steeplechase .

"Bookmakers predict a £10million betting avalanche on AP McCoy for his final five Cheltenham Festival rides on Friday afternoon. The soon-to-retire 19-time champion struck for the first time at this meeting on Uxizandre in Thursday's Ryanair Chase and will be on board Irish-trained 10-1 shot Carlingford Lough on Friday as he tries to win the £550,000 Gold Cup for a third time. He also has fancied rides on Hargam in the Triumph Hurdle opener and Ned Buntline in the concluding Grand Annual Chase, which has been named in his honour. AP McCoy gets a kiss from his wife Chanelle after winning the third race of the third day of the Festival . A message on the giant screen pays tribute to McCoy who has just one day of his final Festival left . McCoy’s wife, Chanelle, had admitted that two unsuccessful days had left her soon-to-retire husband in a downbeat mood. But after joining him on the winner’s podium, she said: ‘Inside he will be feeling elated. He is not the most animated at the best of times and he was slightly melancholy leaving the house this morning. This will absolutely mean the world to him. I’ll have a happy husband.’ Uxizandre led from start to finish as his rivals failed to catch him during the Ryanair Chase on day three . McCoy's success has led to an avalanche of support for the jockey with the bookies . McCoy’s 31st Festival success sets him up for his 20th and final ride in the £550,000 Gold Cup today on Carlingford Lough, owned, like Uxizandre, by his boss JP McManus. He has four other rides, including favourite Ned Buntline in the concluding AP McCoy Grand Annual Chase.","The 19-time champion jockey won his first race of the meeting on Thursday .

"By the time referee Wayne Barnes blew the final whistle, large chunks of the world-record crowd had long since drifted away into the north London night. Such was Saracens’ dominance of a Harlequins team who have completely lost their way, even the dubious lure of a Mexican wave had lost its appeal for the ‘away’ fans. Those left inside did muster a roar when Billy Vunipola dotted down for a deserved try with two minutes remaining, but Quins had been so inept for large parts of this game that a five-try victory felt slightly hollow.

Pop singer Pixie Lott performs at half-time in front of the record breaking 84,068 crowd at Wembley Stadium . The 24-year-old performs for the Saracens and Harlequins supporters during the Aviva premiership match . Saracens won’t care a jot. They were tack sharp for much of the game, physical and confrontational when they needed to be with a pack more than willing to mix it and a back line full of invention. It was just a shame the 84,068 crowd, many of them no doubt watching their first game of professional rugby, witnessed such a no-contest. Saracens have won all but one of their last 14 matches against their London rivals and on this evidence it will be a long time before they are troubled again. Quins, eighth in the Aviva Premiership table and with next to no chance of European qualification, really were that bad. Their returning England contingent of Chris Robshaw, Joe Marler and Nick Easter were unable to make any notable impact up front, while behind the scrum they were devoid of ideas. The world record breaking 84,068 attendance for a club rugby match is revealed on the Wembley scoreboard . Harlequins' Danny Care chips the ball forward during his side's 42-14 defeat by Saracens at Wembley . Saracens' Wyles and Harlequins' Ross Chisholm both try to catch the high ball during the premiership match . They missed the cutting edge of their concussed full back Mike Brown and scrum-half Danny Care is badly short of confidence after being dropped by England last autumn. The same cannot be said of Saracens, who consolidated their second spot in the table with a bonus-point win that saw winger Chris Ashton score an excellent brace. USA centre Chris Wyles excelled at 12 alongside the equally impressive Marcelo Bosch. With Owen Farrell, Brad Barritt and Schalk Brits set to return from injury soon, Saracens appear to be coming good at the right time. ‘The second 20 minutes of the first half was as good as we’ve been all season,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We counter attacked really well and looked dangerous on the ball. We went off the boil in the next 20 minutes but put a lot of pressure on towards the end.’ Saracens' Billy Vunipola (right) recovers the ball and dives over the line to score his team's fifth and final try . Wyles (left) scored two tries in Saracens stunning 42-14 victory over Harlequins at Wembley on Saturday . Harlequins' Care (centre) breaks free of a late tackle from Saracens' Neil de Kock (bottom) on Saturday . The only blot on Ashton’s copybook was the yellow card shown for a tip tackle on Matt Hopper with eight minutes to play. No matter. Saracens still scored two tries with the wing off the field. ‘It’s incredibly frustrating,’ said Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea. ‘We’re just too easy to knock off. It’s been a really difficult couple of months. You can see that by how easily we get knocked off our stride, mentally. When you are used to success it hurts even more.’ It could all have been so different for Quins. On the same Wembley pitch where Harry Kane had taken just 78 seconds to open his international account for England the night before, young Quins flanker Jack Clifford dotted down 28 seconds into this contest after charging down Neil de Kock’s clearance. It proved to be as good as it would get for Quins as Wyles and Ashton scored superbly worked first-half tries. Quins lost prop Kyle Sinckler with a knee injury sustained courtesy of a dubious tackle by flanker Jacques Burger. Ashton’s 52nd-minute try put Saracens out of sight before the two more late tries put deserved gloss on the score. They will travel to face Racing Metro in the last eight of Europe next Sunday full of belief.

"Need some inspiration deciding who to back at Cheltenham? Sportsmail's Marcus Townend and Peter Scudamore reveal their favourites... Peter Scudamore - Eight-time champion jockey and rider of 13 Festival winners . HARGAM (Triumph Hurdle, 1.30) No secret that this is regarded as one of AP McCoy’s best chances of the week. He was recruited from France, where he showed decent form on the Flat, and although he was beaten by a good rival on his hurdling debut, has won his two races since. Last time out he slammed Starchitect, who ran a commendable fourth in the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle here on Tuesday. BEST ODDS: 6-1 . AP McCoy and Hargam won the JCB Triumph Hurdle Trial at Cheltenham in December . HOLYWELL (Gold Cup, 3.20) Rain would admittedly diminish confidence in Jonjo O’Neill’s runner but he has all the credentials to run really well. He has won at the past two Festivals, peaks at this time of year and has been re-fitted with the blinkers which seem to bring out the best in him. His last time out victory at Kelso indicated the spark had been rekindled in this gelding by his shrewd trainer after a couple of moderate efforts. BEST ODDS: 9-1 . CURRENT EVENT (Foxhunters’ Chase, 4.0) Owned, but not trained, by Paul Nicholls and prepared for this race by one of his long-time staff, Rose Loxton. Had won his previous seven point-to-points before being taken up to Musselburgh where he sauntered home in a Hunter Chase. Paul Nicholls is pictured with Sir Alex Ferguson and owns Current Event . BEST ODDS: 9-1 . NEXT SENSATION (Grand Annual Chase, 5.15) Fourth in this race last year after trying to make all the running and only being overhauled after the last fence. He races off a similar handicap mark and, while his form this season has been a touch below par, he has had a breathing operation since his last run. BEST ODDS: 10-1 . CAPTAIN HEATH - Marcus Townend on the best each-way bets . KAREZAK (Triumph Hurdle, 1.30) Alan King’s entry has been locking horns with the best juvenile hurdlers all season and, while a sequence of four second places might seem off-putting, he does not lack heart. Fast pace should play to his strengths and could hit the frame. BEST ODDS: 20-1 . Karezak (pictured right) is a decent each way bet in the opener on the Festival's final day . TEA FOR TWO (Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle, 2.40) Romped home in January’s Lanzarote Hurdle at Kempton and subsequently beaten at Ascot. But those races were at a shorter distance and the mount of Lizzie Kelly shapes as if he will improve for the greater stamina test. BEST ODDS: 33-1 . THE GIANT BOLSTER (Gold Cup, 3.20) Has become a regular in this race having finished second, fourth and third in the last three runnings. Form this season has been unspectacular but this has been the day local trainer David Bridgwater has trained him for all season. Hard to see him winning but easier to see him in the places under regular jockey Tom Scudamore. BEST ODDS: 33-1 . HOTSPOTS . Work Whisper: One Last Dream (Wolverhampton, 5.45) Weighting Game: That’s The Deal (Fakenham, 2.55). Down 22lb from last winning mark. Burnt Fingers: Revolutionist (Lingfield, 4.25)","Peter Scudamore fancies Hargam to give AP McCoy the perfect start to his final day at Cheltenham in the Triumph Hurdle .

"It has proved somewhat of a mixed week for trainer Nicky Henderson with some success and a few near misses, but PEACE AND CO (Cheltenham, 1.30) has looked a class act since joining the Lambourn maestro and is taken to land the JCB Triumph Hurdle. Henderson, who had his first winner of the Festival when Call The Cops won the Pertemps Network Hurdle, has a strong hand in the opener with Top Notch and the classy Hargam providing terrific back-up artillery for his main gun. They should both run huge races, with the latter especially dangerous given the way he travels and jumps. However, Peace And Co looked to have an extra gear in reserve on his British debut at Doncaster and I have rarely seen a juvenile hurdle with such enthusiasm and precision. Peace and Co looks a solid bet to land the JCB Triumph Hurdle . Nicky Henderson also has Top Notch and the classy Hargam running in the opener . Everything went wrong for the son of Falco on trials day as a small field and sluggish pace led to him pulling hard and over-racing early on, but he still possessed the quality to score readily and the likelihood of a stronger gallop is sure to suit today. The Willie Mullins trio of Dicosimo, Kalkir and Petite Parisienne all look to have viable credentials with preference for the latter, who was a smooth winner of the Spring Juvenile Hurdle at Leopardstown, one of the chief trials for his race. LE MERCUREY (Cheltenham, 4.40) is another French import who arrived on these shores with a big reputation and, although he has been a slower burner than most, he could be ready to strike. Paul Nicholls has been highly competitive in the week’s hurdle events and his five-year-old shaped with plenty of promise in an Ascot handicap on his latest start when staying on nicely late on behind Baradari. Some will think he has plenty of weight, but his handler looks to have found a race where exciting conditional Sean Bowen can be utilised fully, and Nicholls won this event two years ago with Salubrious before Caid Du Berlais was third last year. Paul Nicholls stands alongside Sir Alex Ferguson and the trainer can look for more success . Le Mercurey is pictured at Nicholls' Manor Farm Stables  in Ditcheat . The progressive Roi Des Francs, winner of a Grade Three Hurdle at Clonmel last time, looks dangerously well treated and rates as the chief danger, while course winner Barizan could be overpriced, given his stable switch and change of headgear. Alan King pulled a rabbit from the hat with AP McCoy’s 16-1 mount Uxizandre in the Ryanair Chase and GRUMETI (Cheltenham, nap, 5.15) looks a sporting bet to land the finale. Like Uxizandre, King reaches for the first-time headgear for his seven-year-old, who was progressing nicely over fences until he stepped up in trip for a Sandown Grade One last time and found it all too much. His previous efforts, including behind Vibrato Valtat in a Warwick novice chase, read pretty well and he won with plenty in hand at Plumpton on his penultimate start, a victory which qualifies the selection for a bonus if he can complete the double today. Ned Buntline is sure to have plenty of supporters behind his rider and he should again run well given he was only beaten a length in the race last year, while it would be no surprise to see a resurgent Next Sensation, fourth 12 months ago, also acquit himself well.","Peace and Co (Cheltenham, 1.30) has looked a class act since joining the Lambourn maestro and is taken to land the JCB Triumph Hurdle .

"If Uxizandre’s Ryanair Chase success on Thursday is to be AP McCoy’s last Festival win - the 31st of his career - it will stick long in the memory. But, typically, at least for the time being, it will be confined to the recesses of the McCoy memory bank as he fixes his thoughts on the prospect of a fairy-tale end to his Cheltenham career on Friday afternoon. Over breakfast, he might afford himself a smile - of contentment not satisfaction, you don’t win 19 championships being satisfied - as he dares to dream what might be when his Betfred Gold Cup mount, Carlingford Lough, begins his bid for glory shortly after 3.20pm. One thing is certain, the mood will be better at the McCoy table than it was 24 hours earlier. AP McCoy rides Uxizandre to victory in Thursday’s Ryanair Chase for his 31st Cheltenham Festival win . McCoy celebrates with the trophy after his first Festival win of 2015 with his Peadar McCoy by his side . Wife Chanelle admitted the atmosphere had been ‘melancholy’ after two fruitless days amid, no doubt, a creeping fear that things were not going her husband’s way for his last performances on the greatest of jump racing stages. McCoy's wife Chanelle admitted a ‘melancholy’ had come over AP after two winless days but that he was delighted to break his duck on the 16-1 shot . All that changed when 16-1 shot Uxizandre, not even the first string of his trainer Alan King in the Ryanair Chase but transformed by the fitting of a visor, galloped out in front and never looked like being caught as he passed the finishing line five lengths clear of Ma Filleule. Even the crowd seemed stunned at first. The roar took time to grow but by the time McCoy had returned to the winners’ enclosure, they were raising three cheers. After being joined on the winner’s podium by Chanelle, his father Peadar and boss JP McManus, McCoy said: ‘Cheltenham is a very special place. It is where every jockey wants to win and I am no different. These are the days I am going to miss that’s for sure. ‘I had lots of rides coming into the week but did not have any real bankers. ‘You have to keep going race after race and hope one of them wins. That is how my life has normally been, so there is no point changing this week. ‘I was all right. You can try your best to make them go faster but you need the horse — and this horse is very well. ‘I was a bit worried he would not have the stamina to see it out but he got a lot of the others in trouble trying to keep up with him.’ McManus, his ally for a decade, looked as if he derived just as much satisfaction at being able to supply one last winner for his retained jockey as he does landing one of his legendary punts. He said: ‘It is great to have a man like AP on your side. I am just so happy he has had a winner at his last Festival and that we provided it for him makes it even better. JP McManus, AP's ally for a decade, was as delighted for his jockey as he was for his own win . JP said: 'I am so happy he has had a winner at his last Festival ... that we provided it for him makes it better' ‘I remember years ago Christy Roche rang me and said ‘‘Have you seen this young lad ride? He should be handicapped, not the horses’’. ‘I respect AP and love everything he does on and off the racecourse.’ McCoy will wear the green and gold McManus colours on John Kiely-trained Carlingford Lough, as well as his three other four rides on his last day as a jockey at the Festival — Hargam, Princely Conn and Ned Buntline in the concluding Grand Annual Chase which carries his own name. McManus has not ruled out the dream Gold Cup ending . He said: ‘Carlingford Lough has a chance in a very open race. I was hoping he might be good enough. ‘He had a few problems earlier in the season but nothing serious. He improved from the run in the Lexus Chase at Christmas and has a good 10-1 chance of winning in an open Gold Cup.’ There are definitely plenty of dangers — about 17 of them — as few can be ruled out. Defending champion Lord Windermere aims to win at his third consecutive Festival and provide his trainer, Jim Culloty, with a first win under rules since the week after last year’s Gold Cup. A win for last year’s fourth and the form horse of the race, favourite Silviniaco Conti, would also put his trainer Paul Nicholls, who additionally saddles Sam Winner, level with the late Tom Dreaper as a record five-time race winner. McCoy stands with Carlingford Lough after their win in the Hennessey Gold Cup at Leopardstown on February 8. He'll be riding the same mount in the Betfred Gold Cup on Friday shortly after 3.20pm . But his lack of course form is a worry and, the chaotic and close nature of last year’s finish means it is surely better to look at one of the younger first time runners; horses like Noel Meade’s Road To Riches, Oliver Sherwood’s Many Clouds and Jonjo O’Neill’s Holywell, who at one point looked like being McCoy’s mount. Also in that category is the Willie Mullins-trained Djakadam, behind whom there is growing confidence, and Carlingford Lough. But if McManus acknowledged he was unsure if his horse could supply the win everyone craves, he reckons he has found a way to replace his soon- to-retire jockey. ‘We’ve had him cloned,’ he joked.

"The charity race at Cheltenham is supposed to be all about the taking part - except when serial winners Sir Alex Ferguson and multi-champion trainer Paul Nicholls are involved. Co-owner Fergie and Nicholls were so keen for the Ditcheat trainer’s head lad Clifford Baker to ride the winner that his fancied mount Rainy City, who cost £100,000, had exploited the grey areas of eligibility for the last race on the Festival card yesterday. The regulations, confirmed by a Cheltenham spokeswoman, state that horses in the line-up should all have been given an average BHA rating to ensure a competitive race. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and Paul Nicholls (left) were at Cheltenham to watch Rainy City finish fifth . Yet Rainy City, who is highly thought of in the Nicholls yard, had no BHA rating, and rival jockeys were concerned that Fergie’s horse was far superior to the rest of the field. The get-out clause buried in the fine print was that any horse without a rating could be handicapped by Cheltenham at their discretion. In the event, Rainy City finished an outpaced fifth, having led for most of the 1m 5f. Nicholls said: ‘Of course we wanted to win. But it’s a charity race and we entered to give Clifford a ride.’ Arena Racing Company, who own racecourses that stage 40 per cent of UK fixtures, still chose to hold their annual drinks party during Cheltenham, even though it is not one of their tracks. ARC are owned by the Reuben brothers, the billionaire property developers who have caused serious upset by closing down popular racecourse Hereford and moving its meetings to the over-raced Chepstow and Uttoxeter tracks. Hereford is now empty most of the time as part of a long-term property play between the local council and the Reuben brothers, who are never seen at the races. Arena Racing Company were among many companies hosting their annual drinks at Cheltenham . It doesn’t say much for the commitment to developing homegrown cricket talent that England selector Mike Newell, in his other role as Nottinghamshire’s director of cricket, has signed Zimbabwe batsman Brendan Taylor as a Kolpak player. The 29-year-old has played 23 Tests and 166 ODIs. The move follows another England selector, Middlesex boss Angus Fraser, bringing in New Zealander James Franklin on an Irish passport. Minister for Sport Helen Grant is a guest of the British Horseracing Authority and Jockey Club at Cheltenham today. But Grant, a modest drinker, is unlikely to embrace the liquid Festival hospitality as heartily as one of her predecessors did last year. The former minister was barely able to walk through the car parks after the meeting. Minister for Sport Helen Grant, a modest drinker, is unlikely to end up like a predecessor at Cheltenham . LTA back in fat cat mode . LTA chief executive Michael Downey has yet to justify an annual salary and benefits package of £434,000 plus a massive one-off relocation payment of £190,000. Nor did the Canadian do his image much good by wearing a GB tracksuit top during last weekend’s Davis Cup triumph over the USA in Glasgow — a cardinal sin for a sports administrator. LTA chairman David Gregson had said Downey would receive a £300,000 salary on his appointment but it seems the excesses of the Roger Draper regime are already in danger of being repeated. LTA chief executive Michael Downey was not his usual suited self in Glasgow - he wore a GB tracksuit top . There will be only five more racing days after Saturday before Clare Balding turns her back on presenting the sport following Royal Ascot. But the Balding effect has not boosted Channel 4’s viewing figures — quite the reverse. The Cheltenham peak of 996,000 was down again on Wednesday, year on year, by 20,000. And the last time Cheltenham enjoyed four consecutive days of 1m-plus ratings was pre-Balding in 2012, when Highflyer produced the coverage and John McCririck, John Francome and Derek Thompson were all still on board. Clare Balding arrives at Cheltenham Festival, but her presence has not helped viewing figures . Only Cheltenham could consider £30,000 for two season tickets in the Cheltenham Club good value. However, 100 of the 300 memberships available for the grand top-floor facility in the new £45million grandstand, which are being sold on a minimum three-year basis, have already been bought.

"Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski insists he wants to carry on playing in the Barclays Premier League despite being linked to Italian giants Roma. Poland international Fabianski joined Swansea from Arsenal on a free transfer last summer and has proved a fine acquisition in keeping 11 clean sheets to help the Welsh club into the top half of the league.

"Simon McClaren-Tosh, right, is accused of sexually assaulting five girls as young as eight at his home in Berkshire, pictured with a young polo player whose face has been obscured to protect his identity . A former top polo player was accused yesterday of sexually abusing five girls aged eight and nine. Simon McLaren-Tosh allegedly filmed himself molesting his young victims at his polo centre home last year. McLaren-Tosh, 49, a former professional player who sits on the game’s global ruling body, the Hurlingham Polo Association, was charged on Sunday and was remanded in custody when he appeared in court yesterday. In a case that will rock the polo world, police swooped on the married father of two after receiving a tip-off from police in Russia. Officers from Thames Valley Police raided his home, seizing his phones and computers, Slough Magistrates’ Court in Berkshire was told yesterday. Tina Flannery, prosecuting, alleged: ‘The sexual assaults were committed against young children aged eight years old. ‘The assaults were also photographed by him, he filmed himself committing the offences. There is a huge breach of trust.’ McLaren-Tosh, a former member of the Royal Berkshire Polo Club, is accused of five charges of sexual assault on a child under 13. The offences are alleged to have happened on two occasions between April and August last year. Wearing a navy blue fleece jumper, dark jeans and glasses, blond-haired McLaren-Tosh spoke only to confirm his name and deny all five counts when he stood in the dock yesterday. Presiding magistrate Anne Brown remanded him in custody to appear before a judge at Reading Crown Court for a preliminary hearing next month. McLaren-Tosh’s family home is at a polo centre and farm in the wealthy village of Maidens Green, near Warfield, Berkshire. He owns two businesses: Livery and Polo Management, which is based at his family home; Berkshire Classic Cars, which buys and sells collectable cars. The court heard that since the allegations emerged he has moved out of the family home, which he shared with his wife Louise and two children, and moved in with his parents at their farm in Devon. McLaren-Tosh was arrested by Thames Valley Police after returning from a holiday to France last month and was then released on bail. He was re-arrested and questioned by police on Sunday and then charged. McLaren-Tosh plays off a polo handicap of two and now umpires matches. In 2000, when he was playing professionally, he was part of a team that won the Roehampton Trophy, the oldest polo trophy in the UK. McLaren-Tosh’s family home and business is set in huge grounds in Maidens Green. Yesterday a tractor and horse box could be spotted through the hedge but there were no staff or horses in the deserted grounds.

"Ryan LaFlare faces one of the toughest challenges of his unbeaten career as he takes on perhaps the most decorated Brazilian jiu jitsu practitioner ever to grace the Octagon in Demian Maia. Maia proved against welterweight title challenger Rory MacDonald last year that once he takes control from the top, there is no way out. But while New Yorker La Flare acknowledges the tough test that lies ahead, he believes he will hold the advantage in the striking and wrestling departments. Ryan LaFlare will be hoping to make it 12 from 12 when he takes on Demian Maia at UFC Fight Night 62 . LaFlare kicks his opponent John Howard during their bout at UFC Fight Night 39 in Abu Dhabi . Veteran fighter Maia (left), pictured fighting Alexander Yakovlev, will pose a real threat to LaFlare's record . 'The guy is one of the top guys in the world, you know, of course he's good,' he told Sportsmail. 'I'm just a little better. I think that his striking is maybe a little more basic for me. 'I think I have a little bit more of an awkward, outside of the box approach to it and I think that that's something I can use. A lot of his wrestling is pretty basic and I've been wrestling my whole life, so that's another thing I can use.' Having been out of action for nearly a year after being struck down with a bone infection last August, Maia is reporting a clean bill of health ahead of the contest and the submission specialist is looking to impress his countrymen in Rio. 'I am very proud to be here in Brazil again,' he said. 'I'm very happy with the opportunity the UFC has given me, to fight a main event here in Rio de Janeiro, a city I love - especially returning from an injury. I am 100 per cent now, I feel much stronger than I felt in my past camps.' Maia poses duriong the UFC Fight Night weigh ins at Maracanazinho earlier on Friday . And when it comes to LaFlare's 11-0 record, which includes four consecutive wins under the UFC banner, Maia knows that he will have to be on top form to put the first blemish on the American's clean record. 'I will need to want to win the fight a lot more than he wants to,' he added. 'Because I know he has a lot of will power, but I need to have more than him.' Despite other fighters citing their reluctance to face off against a Brazilian opponent on their home turf, LaFlare believes that the crowd will offer Maia no advantage once the Octagon door shuts. 'I don't think it makes any difference to me. Once the Octagon doors are shut, it's just me and him in the cage,' he said. 'Some people could think differently but, for me, it's just me and him – just another day in the office.' The Brazilian Fight Night's co-main event packs a huge punch as well, as spectacular striker Erik Silva faces off against polarizing UFC veteran Josh Koscheck. Stepping in as a late replacement for Ben Saunders, this is a must-win situation for 'Kos' who is currently on four-fight losing streak in the UFC.

"What next for Javier Hernandez? Unwanted by Manchester United last summer, Real Madrid softened the blow by bringing the Mexican to the Bernabeu in an unlikely move that raised eyebrows across the football world. Could the Spanish giants see something that David Moyes, who had no appetite for Little Pea, could not? Apparently not. Javier Hernandez hasn't been able to make the most of his loan spell at Real Madrid . Hernandez has scored three times in 13 league appearances, coming off the bench on 12 occasions . The 26-year-old was back in the goals for Mexico during their 1-0 victory against Ecuador on Saturday . Hernandez has started just one league match for Carlo Ancelotti's side this season and on Monday night told Fox Sports that he, like fellow Old Trafford outcast Radamel Falcao, had cried at his situation. Still only 26, Hernandez is set to return to Manchester following the expiration of his year-long loan where he will face an uncertain future. The striker's contract with United expires in 2016 and the club will no doubt be looking to cash in. Hernandez made the revelation while on international duty. 'I've cried,' he said. Hernandez is set to return to Manchester following the expiration of his year-long loan in Madrid . 'I've been through everything. The feeling I have most of all over the last couple of years is one of frustration.' He added: 'You feel frustrated when you're part of a team, you do everything you can in training, collaborating and helping, then at the weekend the opportunities to play are minimal. 'I'm in a team but left out of what is important, which are the games.' Hernandez joined United from Guadalajara in 2010. He made 154 appearances in four years at the club, scoring 59 goals and rapidly became a cult hero among fans. But after falling out of favour under Moyes, he moved on when Louis van Gaal arrived. Things have not gone any better in Spain, where Hernandez has scored three times in 13 league appearances, coming off the bench on 12 occasions. While suffering under Moyes the player's agent, Eduardo Hernandez, claimed that six clubs were interested in securing his services, including one global superpower. Hernandez has made 154 appearances in four years at the club, scoring 59 goals . The Mexican frontman struggled to earn a regular first team place under former United boss David Moyes . That was borne out when Madrid swooped - although his stock will have fallen in a miserable 12 months. Will he get another chance at Old Trafford? That is unclear. While Hernandez's cause will no doubt have been helped by a poor season from Falcao, Van Gaal is understood to have lined up replacements and is set for another big-spending summer. Eduardo, if he has not already, might want to start ringing around those other six clubs.

"Being in the right place at the right time is a mark of a successful Formula One driver — a truism that will almost certainly lead Lewis Hamilton to agree a new deal at Mercedes, possibly within the week. The double world champion has chosen shrewdly throughout his career by hitching himself to McLaren in the early years and then moving to Mercedes for the 2013 season, despite the aristocracy of British motor racing advising him to stick with his existing team. The importance of making the correct decision was reinforced on the podium after Sunday’s Malaysian Grand Prix, when he saw Sebastian Vettel on the top step after the German’s own successful move from Red Bull to Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton sits on the podium alongside Sebastian Vettel after he claimed his first victory for Ferrari . Hamilton, out of contract at the end of the season, says his new Mercedes deal will be completed this week . Hamilton, who finished second, also thought of Fernando Alonso, whose career management has been disastrous since he left Renault in 2005, the year he won the last of his two world titles. The Spaniard then walked out on McLaren when he could have won a third championship, went back to Renault as a stop-gap, joined Ferrari while it was moribund and returned to McLaren this season as they are slowly coming to terms with new engine partners Honda. Alonso managed less than half of Sunday’s race before a cooling problem intervened. Vettel, in only his second race for Ferrari, won in the car Alonso had just vacated. ‘It’s nice to see Ferrari back up,’ said Hamilton. ‘I sat next to Sebastian and thought to myself, “What is Fernando thinking?” I remember when I left McLaren and came here, we were better the next year. I had a good feeling then, but he’s almost done the opposite of what I did. It could have been him today. It’s just strange how things turn out. Hamilton finished behind race-winner Vettel in Sepang but still remains in the lead of the world championship . Hamilton led Vettel off the start-line at the Malaysian Grand Prix but eventually lost out to the German . ‘McLaren are a fantastic team. It looks bad now but I’m sure they’ll get it together. Before you know it, it will be the three of us fighting, I’m pretty sure.’ Alonso’s predicament is a terrible shame because he was the heir who supplanted Michael Schumacher as the German approached his first retirement in 2009. Hamilton, 30, does not want to fall into the same trap, and says he is ready to sign a new contract with Mercedes for three more years beyond this season. The tantalising prospect of his joining Ferrari, where he is hugely admired by president Sergio Marchionne, seems remote. They have Vettel and Hamilton is already part of a top team. No matter Sunday’s result — Hamilton beaten on pure pace by Vettel’s Ferrari — Mercedes are the team of the moment. Asked about signing for Ferrari, Hamilton said: ‘No, don’t be silly. My contract at Mercedes should be done this week. There’s no reason why not. Honestly, it’s 99.6 per cent done.’ Hamilton is expected to earn more than his current annual £20million salary when he pens his new deal . The exact terms of drivers’ contracts are kept secret, but it is thought that Hamilton will get more than his current annual £20million salary, though probably not match Vettel’s deal at Ferrari, which could be worth up to £35m if he collects all his bonuses and extras. The Mercedes board want their team to be cost-efficient and will not pay the Earth even for a driver of Hamilton’s talent. As well as tying up the contract, Mercedes will spend the fortnight before the next race in China responding to the Ferrari challenge. It is believed that the cooler temperatures expected in Shanghai will favour Mercedes, but at least their defeat after eight successive wins relieved the monotony. ‘I don’t think Ferrari’s win is a one-off,’ said Hamilton. ‘I don’t think they were lucky or it was a fluke. There’s always talk that they are easier on their tyres. ‘I think we’ll manage. We’ve got a great group of people, a great approach, and from this we’ll take a step back. ‘Second for me and third for Nico (Rosberg) is still good but they’re too close to us in the championship, so we’ll work very hard to analyse. It was not a kick; it was a pinch. We have now got a race on our hands.’ That is good news for the sport and hope for all the teams.","Lewis Hamilton says his Mercedes deal should be finalised in coming days .

"Former England striker Rodney Marsh says he would pay £100million for Harry Kane and backed the Tottenham striker to have a better career than Alan Shearer. Kane, 21, has scored 29 goals in all competitions for Spurs this season and speaking to talkSPORT, Marsh explained that he would pay the incredible sum for the player if he was a chairman. 'I reckon he is worth £100million, I honestly do,' Marsh said. 'If I was a chairman of a football club, that is what I would pay for Harry Kane. I think he is going to go on and be a bigger and better player than Alan Shearer.' Harry Kane's form in the Premier League makes him worth £100million, according to Rodney Marsh . Marsh, who played for England during his own career, said he would pay the fee if he was a chairman . Kane marked his first England appearance with a goal against Lithuania in the 4-0 win on Friday . Marsh justified his belief by comparing Kane to other players who have joined the Premier League for big fees and are yet to match his form. 'Manchester City paid £32million for a relatively untried young player called Eliaquim Mangala. If Mangala is worth £32million, Harry Kane is worth £100million all day long,' Marsh explained. 'Angel di Maria cost Manchester United £60million. I think Harry Kane is a much better player than Di Maria in the Premier League,' Marsh added. Marsh backed Kane to become a 'bigger and better' player than England and Newcastle legend Alan Shearer .

"This was the biggest night of Harry Kane’s extraordinary breakthrough season, so how did the England striker cope with the famed Italian brand of defending on his full debut? ALL SYSTEMS GO . Credit to Roy Hodgson for abandoning his original system in the 54th minute. It simply wasn’t working with Theo Walcott up front with Harry Kane. Ross Barkley replaced him and Wayne Rooney, a peripheral first half figure, was promoted up front to partner Kane. That bold and decisive move gave this more physical duo far more presence in their battle with Italy’s three-man defensive shield. Harry Kane grapples with Emiliano Moretti and Gigi Buffon as the England man makes a nuisance of himself . Kane has a dig from outside the area as England press for an equaliser in the second half . Kane and Spurs team-mate Andros Townsend beam at the final whistle after England's 1-1 draw in Turin . ‘We struggled physically in the second half,’ admitted Italy coach Antonio Conte. He was right. Kane had a couple of decent chances, one deflected away for a corner and another saved well by Gianluigi Buffon when he fed off the scraps from Andros Townsend’s shots. The beauty of this boy Kane is that he shows no fear, standing tall with the rest of this England team as they fought their way back into this game. At the final whistle, Buffon embraced the Tottenham striker before he walked towards the England fans to salute them for travelling to Turin for this friendy. He belongs in this company. ITALIAN MARKING . Prince Harry had Leonardo Bonucci marking him throughout the first half and he was so tight to the England forward it was skin-on-skin at times. Bonucci, along with his central defensive partner Giorgio Chiellini is part of a Juventus team who are top of Serie A and have only conceded 14 goals in the league. You don’t get much change out of these two, especially at international level. It is almost a criminal act for an Italian defender to concede a goal, no matter what the circumstances or the occasion. Kane is sandwiched by Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini as Italy defend a high ball . Chiellini keeps Kane under wraps as the England man struggles for space in the area . Antonio Conte’s team spend hours on the practice pitches going through defensive drills, denying opposition players space in the areas where they can be hurt the most. Rooney had warned this England team about the dirty tricks, but Italy have turned defending in to an art form over the years. They are masters of their trade. This is part of Kane’s education, working out ways to unsettle Italy’s three man defence and pulling at least one of them out of position to open up some space in central areas. STARVED OF SERVICE . Kane's biggest contribution to the first half was his knock-down for Walcott’s effort that rebounded to Wayne Rooney lurking just inside the penalty area. England’s captain hit the bar. That was better, getting the ball in to dangerous areas of the field for Kane to finally do some damage. Still, it was hard to get away from the statistics. Kane leaps for a corner but the ball is punched away but Italy's veteran keeper Gigi Buffon . Kane attempts to rob Alessandro Florenzi of possession during a tricky night in Turin . By the time the England team walked off the pitch at half-time in the Juventus Stadium, when they were losing 1-0, Kane had only touched the ball 15 times, Theo Walcott had 13. That is not nearly enough at this level. The alternative is to stay on the last man, as he did after the break by treading on the toes of Chiellini, his designated second half marker, and acting as a target man. The change gave England options and Kane’s effort at the start of the second half would have troubled Italy’s legendary keeper Gianluigi Buffon, but it was deflected wide for a corner. THAT WAS THE WEEK . This time last year Harry Kane had scored just two goals in his entire career for Spurs: one against Shamrock Rovers in the Europa League and another against Hull City in the Capital One Cup. This has been a momentous week in Harry Kane’s life and he returns to Tottenham’ s training ground to prepare for Sunday’s clash with Burnley as a full international. Kane trudges back to the half way line after England fell behind in the first-half . Kane has a go from outside the box but failed to get on the scoresheet against the wily Italians . After scoring 29 times for Tottenham this season, plus another on his debut for the national team against Lithuania at Wembley last Friday, he remains very much man of the moment. Even at 21 he looks like a man who can take it all in his stride and there is even the possibility that he will be named PFA player of the year or FWA footballer of the year in May. UNDER 21 DILEMMA . Gareth Southgate will hold more talks with the Tottenham forward, but there is pressure from within Wembley for Kane to commit to the Under 21 tournament this summer. Kane has represented England at various levels throughout his international career and it will send a strong message to players that they are expected to play in summer tournaments. Kane looks up after finally evading Chiellini's attentions as the England man looks for attacking options . Kane is kept at arm's length by Chiellini as the Juventus defender keeps a close eye on the England man . The Spurs forward has played an awful lot of football this season, but there is a real momentum building with the Under 21 team after their fine comeback and eventual victory over Germany at the Riverside on Monday evening. With Kane in the Under 21s this summer, along with West Brom forward Saido Berahino, England would have one of the most potent attacking partnerships at the tournament.","Kane had a tough first half on his full England debut  but when Roy Hodgson put Wayne Rooney alongside him, it yielded dividends .

"Rugby World Cup organisers are urging fans trying to buy tickets to remain patient amid mounting anger about endless delays on the official website. There was huge demand when general sales resumed on Tuesday and by the evening, there were tickets still available for 17 matches in the tournament - being held in this country in September and October. All seats on sale at this stage for the opener, England v Fiji, had been snapped up, but two of Wales’ matches, against Fiji and Uruguay in Cardiff, remained up for grabs. Rugby World Cup organisers have asked fans to be patient amid anger about delays on the official website - sales for Millennium Stadium fixtures continued to lag behind other venues . The total number of tickets  available when they first went on sale in September last year. Sales for fixtures at the Millennium Stadium continued to lag behind other venues, with a further three matches there still showing availability, although the remaining tickets for France v Ireland had been bought. The latest allocations for New Zealand v Argentina at Wembley and Scotland v South Africa at St James’ Park had also been rapidly claimed. However, it was a day when many supporters were left incensed by the process of trying to buy tickets online. With vast numbers attempting to the access the official website, delays of several hours and various technical glitches were reported by many of those trying to buy. Social media was awash with tales of angst as the system struggled to cope with the traffic. Recently departed chief executive Debbie Jevans had insisted before she resigned that the website would cope with demand. ‘The capacity we’ve built into the system means we are confident it will stand up,’ she predicted. But the experiences posted on Twitter by frustrated would-be spectators told a different story. Former head of the organising committee Debbie Jevans insisted the website would cope with demand . Tom Andrews tweeted: ‘I have been in online Queue for rugby world cup tickets for 8hrs 45 mins, unbelievable!!’ Rupert Garrett was equally fed up, posting: ‘Been queuing since 10am for Rugby World Cup tickets but still having to wait! Same happened with Olympics. Waste of time Disillusioned Joke!’ It was a similar story for ‘LittleMead’, who tweeted: ‘I know British people love to queue, but the Rugby World Cup tickets wheel of doom is something else! #whyarewewaiting’ Jamie Cleland added: ‘Seems to be a consistent pattern of ticket distribution for major sporting events. You’d think best practice would now be learned.’ An England Rugby 2015 spokeswoman insisted on Tuesday night that many thousands of tickets were sold yesterday but conceded that ‘there have been a lot of queues on the website and we are aware of that’. The official line is that those who managed to access the system often spent long periods browsing the options, which led to a delay for others in the queue. Having begun the day with around 70,000 tickets to sell, officials were attempting to keep potential spectators informed of progress via Twitter. But with an official re-sale programme now in operation, matches will not be declared official sell-outs as tickets may become available again at a later date.","Fans  urged to be patient following huge delays on Rugby World Cup site .

"He has found the back of the net for Tottenham on 29 occasions this season, but one goal in particular stands out for England's newest hero Harry Kane. It arrived on February 7 and proved to be the winner, 86 minutes into a fiercely contested north London derby with  local rivals Arsenal. It was Kane's 22nd strike of a remarkable season and one he won't be forgetting in a hurry. Tottenham striker Harry Kane will make his first start for England in a friendly against Italy on Tuesday . Kane counts this header against Arsenal in February as the best goal he has scored during his career . Harry Kane was speaking to Match magazine . Asked what the best goal he has ever scored is in an interview with MATCH magazine, Kane said: 'It'll have to be the header against Arsenal, mainly because of the importance of it. 'A good goal is where you score it as much as how you score it. That was a big moment in the game and it was my first north London derby.' The Spurs striker will make his first start for the Three Lions on Tuesday night when he lines up alongside Wayne Rooney for a friendly against Italy in Turin. Kane scored just 79 seconds into his debut against Lithuania last Friday as England continued their charge towards Euro 2016 with a comfortable 4-0 win. As well as targeting a place in Roy Hodgson's squad for the tournament in France next summer, Kane also hopes to represent his country on the biggest stage of all. Asked whether he dreams of playing at the 2018 World Cup, he added: 'Yeah, of course. As a kid, you grow up wanting to play for your country in the major tournaments. 'It's definitely something I aspire to do. Hopefully I keep improving and when the time comes, hopefully I can play in one.' Kane heads home his first international goal just 79 seconds into his England debut against Lithuania . Kane admits that he is dreaming about playing for England at the 2018 World Cup in Russia . Kane has won plaudits for his work-rate  this season but he insists that working hard for club and country just comes naturally to him. Questioned about why other strikers don't appear to put as much effort in as him, Kane said: 'Ha, ha! That's quite a compliment! 'I think other strikers do, but it's in my personality to work as hard as I can for the team. You'll have to ask other strikers why they don't work so hard.'

"Jenson Button has praised Ferrari for taking the Formula One fight to Mercedes, although feels Sebastian Vettel may have 'lucked' into the team's latest resurgence. After a run of eight straight Mercedes victories stretching back into what proved to be a crushing 2014 campaign, Ferrari and Vettel proved there may be a battle ahead this term with a win in Malaysia on Sunday. It was Ferrari's first triumph for almost two years and has given the championship scrap this season a shot in the arm after Mercedes' romp in the opening race in Australia which suggested another dominant run was looming. Sebastian Vettel waves the Ferrari flag in parc ferme after winning Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix . The four-time world champion clenches his fists are claiming the first victory of his Ferrari career . Assessing Ferrari's success, McLaren star Button said: 'I am really happy to see Ferrari win. I thought Mercedes were going to trounce it this year, so it is great for the sport and for other teams to see another take it to Mercedes. 'It is not as if the weather was funny or safety cars destroyed their race, Sebastian was just quicker. I was very impressed by him. 'He did a great job which shows things can turn around over a winter, which is good to see for every team. It's nice to see someone challenge them.' But despite how well Vettel drove, Button feels there has to be an element of good fortune he was back on the top step after leaving Red Bull at the end of last season for Ferrari. The Ferrari pit-wall salute Vettel as he crosses the line to win the second round of the championship . Jenson Button is pictured speaking to Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat ahead of Sunday's race in Malaysia . Button has intimated it is unlikely new McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso would have left Ferrari if he had known the team would be winning again just two races into 2015. 'He has definitely lucked into a situation, I would say,' added Button. 'I am sure he had the same information as Fernando when Fernando left the team. 'It is one of those situations which sometimes works out for you, for example (Daniel) Ricciardo was overtaken by his new team-mate (Daniil Kvyat), and lapped by his ex-team-mate (Vettel) on the same lap. 'Who would have thought that at the end of last year, so sometimes you do luck into a situation.' It would appear McLaren need luck and a whole lot more besides to make them competitive any time soon as both Button and Alonso retired with technical issues. It was the first time neither McLaren had been classified since the 2006 Australian Grand Prix. 'We have a lot of work to do before we can think about winning,' said Button. 'I don't think we will be even fighting for points when we go to the next race in China, maybe Bahrain if we make a small step before then. 'But it is probably going to be Europe we start fighting for points, and that would be a massive step.'","Jenson Button admitted he was 'happy' to see Ferrari beat Mercedes .

"Diafra Sakho has had no trouble finding the net for West Ham this season, and that continued on the Hammers' mid-season break to Dubai. Unfortunately for the Senegalese striker, it was on the tennis court as he took some time away from the sport he knows best. West Ham fans will be relieved to find that Sakho is unlikely to quit his day job for a place on the ATP World Tour any time soon... that's if his Instagram video is anything to go by. Diafra Sakho takes on Chelsea's Gary Cahill during West Ham's last Premier League game, on Wednesday . The east London side have headed to warmer climes to enjoy their week off from Premier League action as attention turns to the FA Cup. Sam Allardyce's men were knocked out by West Brom in the fifth round, and will not take to the field again until they face Arsenal next weekend. While the Southampton squad headed to the slopes in snowy Switzerland, West Ham opted for something warmer; the 30 degree heat of the United Arab Emirates. Sakho has scored 11 goals for the Hammers so far this season; nine of which in the Premier League, and he and his team-mates have now been rewarded for their hard work with a trip abroad. On West Ham's mid-season break to Dubai, Sakho took to the tennis court in the Dubai sunshine . Sakho did not seem as comfortable on the tennis court as he does for West Ham on the football pitch . West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald told the club's official website: 'Since the start of December it's been full on and we're only just coming up for air at the start of March. 'It's been a tough couple of months but what we normally do is go away so the lads can get a bit of sun on their backs. 'We do a bit of training in the gym and along the beach, as well as having a couple of football sessions. It's more important that they have a bit of relaxation time and get the sun on their backs. 'In last two or three months everyone’s had their tracksuit tops, gloves and hats on and it’ll be great to go across there and we’ll still be working, but special for the boys that it’s in the heat.'

"Gareth Bale is being linked with a move away from Champions League winners Real Madrid as the former Tottenham forward continues to face criticism from the club's supporters. Manchester United and Chelsea have both been credited with having an interest in bringing the world's most expensive player back to the Premier League. Sportsmail asked Manchester United fan Dave Ford of 90min.com to give his thoughts about a possible switch to Old Trafford. Gareth Bale reacts with disappointment as Barcelona players celebrate after the Clasico on march 22 . Bale scored twice to help Wales beat Israel 3-0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Saturday . Given the opportunity, there's not a club in the world who wouldn't want to sign Gareth Bale and Manchester United are no different. The Welshman is the future of football. United are showing signs of life again. We've picked up our form under Louis van Gaal, sit in the Premier League's top four and beat Liverpool at Anfield prior to the international break. Big money was spent last summer and it will be this year too. It's all systems go in terms of firing us back to the top of English and European football. However, while the attack is starting to click into gear, something is still missing. Some kind of X-factor. Most of us have confidence that Angel Di Maria will come good, but we still want more. Bale is what we want. Having two former Real Madrid stars in tandem at Old Trafford is the stuff of dreams. Sure, we'd love to have Cristiano Ronaldo back too, but our former No 7 has just turned 30 and dare we say it - his best days may be behind him. A 25-year-old Bale is the man to pin the hopes on. Bale's celebration was cut short as he had a goal disallowed for offside against Barcelona . Bale argues with Barcelona forward Neymar Jnr as Real lost 2-1 to the La Liga leaders . It's not all plain sailing for the boy from Cardiff in Spain. He has been criticised in the Madrid press for not pulling his weight, he went missing in last weekend's Clasico and his car even got a boot up the backside from a supporter in the fallout. Real Madrid fans are historically fickle and Bale is their latest scapegoat. Rest assured that it'll be his head on the chopping block next time Real lose a game. He doesn't deserve to be treated like some children's toy - picked up when loved and thrown down to the ground when not. Bale should seek a club where his talents are appreciated. Manchester United are prepared to offer an escape route and the subsequent affection he needs. Unfortunately, Bale is still a big part of Florentino Perez's plans and the player himself feels like he still has so much to prove. United are not an option that Bale wants to take just now, but the offer will always remain on the table. Bale has been criticised by fans this season and even had his car attacked by angry supporters . The former Tottenham forward leads the celebrations after scoring his second and Wales' third of the match . His potential signing is not a case of need. After all, no club is going to spend £86m on a player if he isn't considered some kind of luxury. Bale is a player that can lead us to our former glory. You'd only have to look at the effect he had on Tottenham before leaving for Spain for proof of his influence. However much he'd cost, Bale would be a worthwhile investment. His ability to play on either flank or through the middle make him a great option, given he can fit around the likes of Angel Di Maria, Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney in whatever system suits. Heck, he could even play alongside Marouane Fellaini. Any move might unfairly consign the excellent Ashley Young back to bench-warmer, but football has a habit of not being fair. Nevertheless, don't expect the move to happen this summer. Bale has a lot left to prove in Spain and he's too proud a person to walk away from his dream club just yet. But if there's ever a return to the Premier League on the cards for Gareth Bale, we will be waiting with open arms.

"New York City have signed Manchester City goalkeeper Eirik Johansen on a permanent deal after impressing during pre-season. The 22-year-old is a product of the Premier League champions' academy - having joined in August 2008 before signing a professional contract at the Etihad Stadium in 2012. Johansen, a Norway Under 21 international, came on as a second half substitute in two matches for New York City during pre-season - first against Brondby and then in a Carolina Challenge Cup clash against Houston Dynamo. New York City announced the signing of Manchester City goalkeeper Eirik Johansen on Tuesday . 'I had a great experience working with squad and coaches during the pre-season and I'm excited to re-join the team on permanent basis,' Johansen told the New York City's official website on Tuesday. 'The quality of the training really impressed me, as did the way the team came together in such a short period of time.' New York head coach Jason Kreis believes the signing of Johansen merely strengthens their options in the goalkeeping department. The 22-year-old (pictured in 2011) joins the MLS outfit after impressing during their pre-season . 'We had a good look at Eirik over the course of the pre-season, and he adapted well to the team and to our style of play,' he added. 'It's always good to have strong competition for places in the team, and Eirik will add to an already strong group of goalkeepers vying for game time. 'It's a long season and guys will get their opportunities for various reasons.' Johansen will be linking up with Frank Lampard once more when the latter's loan at Manchester City expires this season. The former England international has been using the international break to admire the scenery of New York as he prepares for his highly anticipated move to the city's football team and Major League Soccer on July 1.

"Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown has picked his #one2eleven of stars he  played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club on Sky Sports. It is little surprise the former Arsenal defender has chosen 11 players that once donned the red of the Gunners, but who makes his best line-up? Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown (centre) has chosen his best XI he ever played with in his career . GOALKEEPER: DAVID SEAMAN . David Seaman has to be my No 1 goalkeeper. I'd come from Everton with Neville Southall. You couldn't look at Neville because if you looked at him he'd blame you if the ball was in the back of the net. But David was the complete opposite. David had really sort of soft hands. He was able to take the sting out of a shot. We had a decent defence but it was nothing without David in goal. RIGHT BACK: LEE DIXON . If I'm having to pick one, it has to be Lee Dixon. He was sort of my eyes and ears. He was almost part of my own body. I never had to look to my right because Lee was telling me everything that was going on. Arsenal's Lee Dixon (left) and Tony Adams (centre) shout at Barcelona's Phillip Cocu after a penalty incident . DEFENDER: TONY ADAMS . First bumped into him at the age of 13. Cockney lad, swaggering into the room. I was a little bit of a country bumpkin. We kind of set up a partnership in the youth team. I knew him inside out. I knew his strengths, I knew his weaknesses. He has to get into that team. There's no doubt about it. DEFENDER: SOL CAMPBELL . He turned up at Arsenal around all that publicity and expectation. It was on a train that didn't get out of the station to start with. Wenger stuck with him. Eventually once that train got going, it was unstoppable. It was a real force. He's quick, strong, could see danger. Once he was focussed, he was as good as anyone. LEFT BACK: ASHLEY COLE . Straight away I could see that this kid was going to be a bit special. Ashley would park himself around the senior players. He would listen in, he was a very, very quick learner. A real winner. Just disappointed he had to leave Arsenal early. Gunners captain Patrick Vieira lifts the FA Cup after Arsenal beat Manchester United in the final in 2005 . RIGHT WING: ROBERT PIRES . Just on another planet. The goal that stands out was at Villa Park when he knocks it over Peter Schmeichel. He'd just embarrassed a top keeper. He was just capable of that. You've got to look at what you see in training behind the scenes, and Robert Pires had people applauding the stuff he was capable of. MIDFIELDER: PATRICK VIEIRA . He was the catalyst for all the success that was to come. Without Patrick there wouldn't have been any of these trophies. I can tell you that. He pretended he couldn't speak English at the start, then everyone was talking about him, and I think he grabbed someone by the throat in the dressing room. It showed he had some fight about him. As it unfolded I became his minder. I think people could see he could react a bit and we needed him on the pitch. Absolute top talent. Still to this day he's the same person that walked through the door that very first day at Arsenal. MIDFIELDER: EMMANUEL PETIT . It was a competition between him and Patrick Vieira who was going to be man of the match. Game after game. He was a warrior that could play with that finesse and gave us that buffer whenever we had to defend. Those two in front made our lives very easy. Vieira and Emmanuel Petit celebrate during their Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur in 1999 . LEFT WING: MARC OVERMARS . You've got to ask Gary Neville how pleased was he to see him leave. He was so quick that it was almost as if someone had picked him up and put him there. You didn't see him travel. He put fear into teams. You could just see people backing off giving him space to play in. STRIKER: DENNIS BERGKAMP . His ability. The way he could bend balls around players. Pace as well. Once he got away from you in training - I was no slouch - and you wouldn't catch him. Slow start when he came. I think he was a little bit unsure of the situation he found himself in. Again we weren't really ready. To play with Dennis was a joy. I remember Ian Wright skipping down the marble halls at Highbury when he heard Dennis was coming, because he knew that meant goals. STRIKER: THIERRY HENRY . He had that sort of textbook finish. He was more basic in his finishing. His pace. His power. You've never seen anything like it. This was a top athlete without spikes, he had football boots instead. Unbelievable. I gave him a hard time when he came, as I did with all the strikers. He had that swagger as he does now even in front of the camera. He was turning to the rest of the team: 'You better be able to stick with me.' Whereas at the start we were demanding he came with us. Those two together was an absolute nightmare and I used to giggle when I'd see them in action because I had to train against them.

"The world’s leading authority on the detection of banned performance-enhancing drug EPO in blood says a particularly low level of the substance is explicable only by renal damage or doping — a conclusion that raises fresh doubts over historic alleged doping by a current staff member at Team Sky. As The Mail on Sunday reported last week, court documents in France show that an expert at a 2001 criminal trial concluded from a blood sample taken from a Dutch rider, Servais Knaven, that he had taken artificial EPO. The toxicology reports that led to testimony that Knaven had taken EPO were compiled by two doctors whose evidence was challenged in court, but the court ruled it was good evidence. Knaven has been a ‘directeur sportif’ with vital strategic responsibilities at Team Sky since 2011 and was a 27-year-old rider with Dutch team TVM when the sample was taken during the 1998 Tour de France. Dave Brailsford, former director Sean Yates and Servais Knaven (second right) with Bradley Wiggins in 2012 - a 1998 sample from Knaven showing an EPO level of 0.7 was used to convict traffickers in a French court . The technical paperwork relating to his blood tests carried out by an expert, Francoise Bressolle, showed an EPO level of 0.7. Team Sky say their own unnamed experts, paid by them to examine documents unearthed by the MoS, have exonerated Knaven of any wrongdoing, for reasons unspecified. Knaven was never on trial and therefore did not have an opportunity to challenge the medical evidence; rather his tests and testimony were used to convict EPO traffickers. Knaven never disputed the reading of 0.7 but denied ever taking EPO. Now Robin Parisotto, who invented the first ever blood tests to detect EPO, has told the MoS: ‘The only known causes of such a low EPO level in blood [0.7] is either due to significant renal damage where the kidneys cannot sustain normal production of natural/endogenous EPO and/or the current and previous administration of recombinant [banned] EPO.’ Directeur sportif for Team Sky Knaven signed a police statement in 1998 saying he did not contest the EPO finding. He said he believed it may have been due to ‘great exertion’, which expert Robin Parisotto . Sky did not answer our specific questions but gave this statement: . ‘This relates to events over 15 years ago that were contested and well documented at the time. We looked carefully at the information provided to us by The Mail on Sunday last week, including a review by a panel of three independent world-class experts. Nothing here, including the new medical opinion, causes us, or the experts, to change our view. There is no proof of Doping. Servais Knaven continues to maintain his innocence and to be a valued member of Team Sky.' The MoS has asked Knaven and Team Sky if Knaven had renal damage at the 1998 Tour de France. They have not answered. Parisotto was lead researcher on the pioneering EPO tests, first implemented at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. These tests have morphed into the athlete biological passport and since been adopted by a number of international sporting bodies. Parisotto also currently sits on the biological passport panel of cycling’s world governing body, the UCI. In 1998, Knaven signed a police statement saying he did not contest the EPO finding, but said he did not know why it was so low. He told police he believed it may have been due to ‘great exertion’. Parisotto says: ‘I don’t think that “great exertion” is a plausible explanation for such a low EPO level.’ FRENCH COURT DOCUMENTSNo 1:  This is an extract from the court expert’s summary, specifically in relation to Knaven’s blood and his EPO level, saying in her opinion this was a result of the ‘feedback’ phenomenon where the body is now producing such low levels of EPO as it had recently stopped taking artificial EPO. It finishes by saying: ‘Conclusion: Took exogenous EPO.’ No 2: An extract from the official court summary of the case showing expert witness BRESSOLLE had concluded EPO use by four of the TVM riders, from blood samples. Knaven was one of those four. Ouchakov, Blijelevens and Voskamps were the others. No 3: A summary of an interview, quoting Knaven’s own words, following a police interview on 3 Dec 1998, signed by Servais Knaven to show it is an authentic and accurate representation of what he had said in that interview. He says: ‘I do not dispute this rate [of 0.7]. On the other hand, if this rate is so low, it can result from lots of things other than stopping taking EPO. At least that is what I’ve heard from lawyers and doctors. I believe these people all the more because I’ve never taken EPO. ‘For my part, although I am not a doctor, I think that this perhaps comes from the fact this is due to an earlier great effort.’ No 4: The vital readings that Mrs Bressolle found in Knaven’s blood. The key figure here is the EPO reading in the body: 0.7. This was an abnormally low reading. Last week we revealed that The Mail on Sunday had unearthed a collection of documents, never published or reported before, containing detail about the involvement of Servais Knaven, Team Sky’s Sporting Director, in one of cycling’s major doping scandals. Last week’s revelations came after months of in-depth investigations. When we passed our findings to Team SKY, they refused to act. Most major cycling teams, including Team Sky, have employed former dopers in the past three years - either as riders, coaches, doctors or all three, and there is no rule against this, but Team Sky have a ‘zero tolerance’ (ZT) policy, meaning that if past doping comes to light, that person must leave. Several Team Sky staff have left after confessions since 2012, but not Knaven. Question 1 . The world’s leading blood expert on EPO, Robin Parisotto, has examined the paperwork from Reims. Parisotto invented the first blood tests to detect EPO and sits on the biological passport panel of the UCI. He says the testing Francoise Bressolle did on Knaven’s blood remains credible, concluding: ‘The only known causes of such a low EPO level in blood is either due to significant renal damage where the kidneys cannot sustain normal production of natural/endogenous EPO and/or the current and previous administration of recombinant EPO.’ Did Servais Knaven have renal damage at the Tour de France in 1998? If not, what is his own explanation for that EPO reading, which he did not contest as accurate in a signed police statement in 1998? Question 2 . Servais Knaven’s urine from July 28 1998 showed irregular levels of a banned drug, cortisone. In signed contemporaneous statements he said he ‘did not contest’ the presence in his samples of numerous substances, cortisone included. His explanation was he didn’t know how they got there. Would Team Sky today, with a zero-tolerance policy, accept the rider’s explanation ‘I don’t know how it got there’ as a valid defence? Question 3 . Who are the three ‘independent world-class’ experts cited in Team Sky’s statement of March 7 who say the court documents are no proof of doping? Question 4 . The evidence provided last week by the MoS, and studied by these experts, was accepted as valid in a criminal court case where three defendants were given prison sentences in verdicts, never appealed. On what specific, scientific basis did these three experts reject this evidence? Question 5 . Dave Brailsford said on The Telegraph’s cycling podcast last week that the experts, paid by Team Sky, did not know Servais Knaven’s name when analysing the papers. Is it true the experts didn’t know the papers related to Knaven? (His name appears across the papers) If so, why not? Question 6 . Knaven explicitly told police in 1998 he had no medical conditions requiring treatment with prescription drugs, yet admitted use of one prescription drug, Persantin — a blood thinner — and tested positive for another, Naftidrofuryl. The latter is used by heart patients. Knaven said in 1998 he’d never heard of it, but now admits he used it. Why the apparent contradictions? Question 7 . Team Sky say they were unaware until last week of the contents of the police statements relating to Servais Knaven from 1998 and of various findings during that Tour, including products in his room and system. You now know about the court documents in Reims. Will you go to review them? Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The Mail on Sunday revealed French court documents show an expert at a 2001 criminal trial found Dutch rider, Servais Knaven, took artificial EPO .

"Kell Brook has called on Amir Khan to accept his 'Battle of Britain' challenge after defending the IBF welterweight world title in style in Sheffield on Saturday. Just six months after he was stabbed with a machete in Tenerife, Brook had mandatory challenger Jo Jo Dan on the canvas four times during his return before the Romanian was pulled out of the fight by his corner after the fourth round. Brook now has fellow Brit Khan in his sights and promoter Eddie Hearn confirmed on Saturday that he has Wembley Stadium booked for June 13. Kell Brook celebrates after defending his IBF welterweight world title belt in Sheffield on Saturday . Brook speaks to Sky Sports News on Sunday less than 13 hours after defending his title . Brook called on Amir Khan to accept his challenge of a fight at Wembley Stadium in June . Khan appears reluctant to accept this particular challenge, though that has not stopped Brook from piling on the pressure. The 28-year-old told Sky Sports News: 'Amir Khan has just stepped up to welterweight. It's a massive fight in Britain. It will fill out Wembley. It's something I would really be up for and get excited for. 'I have got the title. To be honest with you, we are going round in circles with that fight. I am the champion. He's got nothing to offer. 'There's a belt on the line. I'm giving him an opportunity. There's going to be a lot of money there for him, probably the most he's earned in a fight.

'It's in Britain. It's a war of the roses. I don't know why he hasn't taken the fight. It baffles me. 'He knows he's delicate around the whiskers as I keep saying. It's just a matter of time before he's forced into that fight because of the public demand and we'll see him on the canvas once again.' Brook also revealed on Sunday that he wants to take on the winner of the May 2 superfight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in a unification bout. Amir Khan (left) pictured with TV personality Scott Disick at a nightclub in Las Vegas on Friday . Brook wants to fight the winner of the May 2 superfight between Floyd Mayweather (left) and Manny Pacquiao . He told TalkSport: 'The fact is Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao; they’re the ones with the belts along with me.

'I want to be involved with the very best fighters out there and they’re the names that really excite me and get me up in the morning. They’re the kind of fights that I want. 'You never know what’s going to happen in boxing. Something could happen with Mayweather and Pacquiao and I could slip in there – you never know.'","Kell Brook has called on Amir Khan to accept his challenge .

"Kell Brook is giving Amir Khan 48 hours to commit to a Battle of Britain at Wembley Stadium on June 13, or else he will find another big name to be given the Special K treatment this summer. Khan says sorry but he will be fighting in America next month, although he will oblige Brook in due course. Brook’s promoter Eddie Hearn does not believe Khan is scared of his man but said: ‘Amir’s family are not certain he would win the fight and realise that if he were to lose it would be game over for their boy.’ Kell Brook celebrates after beating Jo Jo Dan during their IBF World Welterweight Title Fight in Sheffield . There was a whiff of Mayweather-Pacquiao in the Saturday night air in Sheffield after Brook flexed the vivid scar in his left leg and vexed his six months of anxiety since that machete attack on an inadequate challenger for his IBF world welterweight title. By keeping the world waiting for five years, the Money Man and the PacMan have built their rivalry into a half-a-billion-dollar bonanza in Las Vegas on May 2. By keeping the United Kingdom on tenterhooks for another 12 months, Brook and Khan can crank up the ante way beyond what Hearn describes as ‘the biggest pay-day of their lives.’ Brook has called out Amir Khan for the 'Battle of Britain' and gave the boxer 48 hours to commit . Just so long as neither of them is beaten in the interim. That risk will be difficult to evaluate until they each identify their next opponent. Brook is going to Vegas to celebrate his 29th birthday by watching Floyd and Manny contest - the richest fight of all time. He will throw down the gauntlet to the winner but has more realistic alternatives. Brook knocks down Jo Jo Dan for the first time during the one-sided fight at the Motorpoint Arena . They include Mexican legend Juan Manuel Marquez in front of 40,000 of Brook’s neighbours at Sheffield United’s Brammall Lane football ground or Tex-Mex slugger Brandon Rios in the Manchester Arena or London’s 02. Khan is hoping to announce a foe for somewhere in America sometime next month. Ideally Puerto Rican icon Miguel Cotto at catch-weight, maybe controversial Adrien Broner, or the less compelling recent Pacquiao victim Chris Algieri. In truth – impressively though Brook proved his full recovery from that bizarre machete attack in Tenerife six months ago – any of the above would provide sterner opposition than the Canada-based Romanian he employed as a punch-bag in the Motorpoint Arena this weekend. The welterweight knocked Dan around the ring like a rag doll and wants a big one against Khan . Jo Jo Dan became Yo Yo Dan as he went down and up four times in the four one-sided rounds which ended in the inevitable stoppage. As a homecoming party for Brook after winning his world title in the US then almost losing his life in that deeply scarring assault, it was fun for all concerned except the hapless gent in the other corner. Desperate Dan reeled around like a drunk as Special K had him for breakfast, lunch and dinner at one sitting. Brook sends Dan flying for a third time and then knocked him down a fourth before it was stopped . Brook’s first right-hander wobbled him. More of the same dropped him in the second round. He somehow stayed upright in the third but the punishment was unrelenting and down he went twice more in the fourth. The final knock-down came a split-second before what proved to be the final bell. American referee Earl Brown conducted the required standing eight-count before ushering Dan into his corner and then refusing him permission to come out again. Not Brook’s fault since this was his mandatory challenger and he was right to point out that Dan had not been stopped before. Wembley Stadium has been booked for the fight by Eddie Hearn but its remains to be seen if Khan accepts . Although that does beg serious questions of the IBF rankings procedures. Dan reeled around like a drunk in the ring and it is arguable that Brook might have found a tougher rival in the pub round the corner. Brook now rates himself up there with Mayweather, Pacquiao and Khan among welterweight royalty. Hearn concurred with that opinion, saying: ‘When Kell first came to me his father told me he would beat Mayweather one day. Now he is just one more big win away from fighting Floyd.’ That victory will be easier to realise than the super fight in Vegas, since anything other than an anti-climax on May 2 seems certain to result in a second-fortune rematch for Mayweather and Pacquiao in the autumn. Dan had no answer to the power and speed of Brook whose recovered well from his stabbing . But against whom? Marquez is easing his ruptured knee back into training but is not certain to box again and will be expensive to bring to Sheffield if he does. So the greater likelihood is Rios. Brook and his towns-folk would prefer it to be his fellow Brit. When he took the microphone to ask who they wanted him to beat next, the packed crowd roared: ‘Khan, Khan, Khan.’ Brook celebrates after beating Jo Jo Dan during their IBF World Welterweight Title Fight . Hearn would love that, too, and he believes it is also what the British fight fans desire. But he says: ‘If we don’t start talking for real in the next couple of days it will be too late for June 13. And I’m not expecting my phone to ring within 48 hours. They have already said that our fight will happen – but not next.’ Brook can rest easy on his world title and a left leg repaired by nuclear medicine. Having done all that was required of him to stay unbeaten all he needs to do now to bring the big bucks rolling in is stay out of trouble.","Kell Brook has given Amir Khan 48 hours to commit to the Battle of Britain .

"Dark sunglasses were the order of the day for Australia's triumphant cricket team on Monday as they paraded the World Cup trophy to hundreds of fans at a public reception after a night of heavy partying at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. With voices hoarse and complexions pasty after a few snatched hours of sleep, players grinned and sometimes grimaced as their team mates battled to communicate their elation to a relentless MC and a large media throng. 'A little hungover,' Australia's retiring one-day captain Michael Clarke said at Melbourne's Federation Square, when asked how he felt a day after his team's crushing seven-wicket win over New Zealand in the final. Australia captain Michael Clarke holds aloft the Cricket World Cup trophy alongside his team-mates as thousands of jubilant fans thronged Federation Square in Melbourne to celebrate Sunday's triumph over New Zealand . Clarke made his final one-day international appearance at the MCG on Sunday, leading Australia to a seven wicket win over New Zealand . Under cloudless skies in Melbourne, Clarke and Australia marked a fifth World Cup triumph after successes in 1987, 1999, 2003 and 2007 . Green and gold confetti showered the players as they showed off the trophy in Federation Square . 'I think I speak for everybody in that sense. 'No, look, I think we're extremely proud. The fact there was a lot of expectation and added pressure put on us at the start of the tournament being a home World Cup was something we embraced from the first ball of the tournament. 'And I think the boys should be really proud of what we've achieved.' Clarke enjoyed a fairytale finish to his one-day career, hitting a team-high score of 74 in front of a record crowd of over 93,000 and making bowling changes that led to immediate wickets. Australia have yet to name a successor but Steve Smith, who led the test team against India and enjoyed a fine World Cup with the bat, is expected to take the reins. '(Clarke) was a great captain. He's been an aggressive captain on the field, sets aggressive fields. He's got to be somebody that we'll definitely miss,' Australia paceman Mitchell Johnson told reporters. David Warner (left) signs autographs for the huge assembled crowd as Australia once again claimed cricket's biggest prize .

Wearing their winner's medals around their necks, the Australia team share a joke on stage as they reflect on their triumph . Shane Watson grins as he signs autographs for lucky fans in sunny Melbourne, scene of Australia's fifth World Cup victory . Australia have now won four of the last five World Cups, their quarter-final loss to eventual champions India at the 2011 tournament the only interruption to their dominion over one-day cricket dating back to 1999 in England. Along with Clarke, who will continue to captain the test side, a number of seasoned players are likely to have played their last World Cups, including Johnson, all-rounder Shane Watson and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin. But Australia will be able to retain the bulk of their squad and such is their record of regeneration and innovation, they will back themselves to defend their title in England in 2019. Left-arm seamer and player of the tournament Mitchell Starc, already a frightful prospect for most batsmen, is 25 and can only get better if his fitness allows.

He will not be short for quality fast bowling company, with Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and James Faulkner all under 26, not to mention a fit James Pattinson, who missed selection for the World Cup by dint of a lack of preparation after a long battle with injury. Australia may not want for batsmen either, with David Warner, Glenn Maxwell and Smith all easily young enough for a tilt at back-to-back trophies. Though the personnel will be important, Australia's drive to remain top of the heap will be essential as teams plot their downfall over the next four years. Opening batsman Warner laid any doubts about that quality to rest. 'Our goal is to be number one in all formats,' he said. Coach Darren Lehmann posted this picture of the Australian celebrations continuing into the early hours in Melbourne . Lehmann wrote 'still going with the Kings and going hard' as he posted this picture of the players marking the sunrise . Some of the players took the opportunity to read about themselves in the morning papers as the partying continued through the night . The partying was reminiscent of England's after winning the Ashes in 2005, enjoyed especially by Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen .","Australia beat New Zealand by seven wickets to win their fifth Cricket World Cup in Melbourne on Sunday .

The 36-year-old has called time on a career that has included 113 Test matches, 295 one-day internationals and 34 T20Is. His last appearance for his country came in Sunday's World Cup final against Australia in Melbourne, where New Zealand suffered a seven-wicket defeat. Daniel Vettori (centre) has retired from international cricket after his World Cup campaign for New Zealand . Vettori (right) was named in the ICC Team of the Tournament for the World Cup for taking 15 wickets . Vettori's last international game for New Zealand came in the World Cup final, which was lost to Australia . He told reporters at Auckland airport: 'It was my last game for New Zealand, in the final, so it was a lovely way to finish. 'Obviously it would have been great to win, but I'm pretty proud of everyone, the way we've gone about things the last six weeks.' The left-arm spinner, who was named in the ICC team of the tournament after taking 15 wickets, added : 'To be able to finish in the final, albeit without a win, I'm just very grateful for the amount of support I had, particularly from Brendon (captain McCullum) and Mike (coach Hesson). 'To be able to get back from a number of injuries and to be here and to be part of it, and hopefully to be a big contributing factor, is something I'll always treasure.' Vettori became New Zealand's youngest-ever Test player when he made his debut against England in February 1997 at the age of 18 and went on to take 361 wickets in the format, leaving him second in the country's all-time list behind Sir Richard Hadlee (431). Vettori is only one of three men to have scored 4,000 Test runs and taken 300 Test wickets, along with Sir Ian Botham and Kapil Dev. His ODI bow came a month later against Sri Lanka and his final tally of 297 wickets is a Black Caps record, with Kyle Mills second on the list with 240 scalps.

Vettori captained New Zealand in all three formats of cricket and made his debut when he was 18 . Vettori (right)  holds the record for Test and ODI appearances but has quit at the age of 36 . The Auckland-born spinner, who captained New Zealand in all three formats, also holds the record for the most Test (112) and ODI (291) appearances for New Zealand. He also played one Test and four ODIs for the ICC World XI in 2005, taking nine wickets in total. Vettori, who has played for Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire in county cricket, is the head coach of the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League.","Former New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori has quit international cricket .

"Michael Clarke hit a supreme 74 as the departing Australian captain led his country to World Cup glory against New Zealand with a seven-wicket victory in Melbourne on Sunday. A crowd of 93,013 witnessed Australia claim their fifth world title as a match that promised so much ended up being incredibly one-sided. New Zealand were always looking for a miracle after being bowled out for a below-par 183 in 45 overs, despite 83 from Grant Elliott – as Mitchell Starc bowled Brendon McCullum for a duck in the first over. VIDEO Scroll down to watch highlights . Australia captain Michael Clarke lifts the World Cup after his country's seven-wicket victory against New Zealand .

Australia captain Michael Clarke (right) shakes hands with Brendon McCullum after being dismissed for 74 . New Zealand's players look dejected after their disappointing innings cost them the chance of glory in Melbourne . In response, Clarke and Steve Smith shared a 112-run third-wicket partnership as Australia cruised to victory in 34 overs. McCullum called right at the toss and on a sun-bathed Melbourne Cricket Ground the New Zealand captain understandably chose to bat. So often the 33-year-old’s own innings sets the tempo of the Black Caps innings and on Sunday it was no different. Having come out swinging and twice been beaten, McCullum was bowled for a duck by a full, in-swinging Starc delivery that cannoned into off-stump. It sent the MCG crowd into a fit of delirium as a wicket fell in the first over in a World Cup final for the first time ever. Aggressive starts to matches with the bat has seen New Zealand boast an average run-rate of 7.70 in first 10 overs of their innings during this tournament but Australia’s early stranglehold on their opposition saw them make just 31 for one. Clarke’s inspired bowling change provided the next breakthrough as the impressive Glenn Maxwell bowled Martin Guptill (15) with just his second ball. And six balls later New Zealand were reduced to 39 for three as Kane Williamson departed for 12 having attempted to block the explosive Johnson but only succeeded in sending the ball straight back to the bowler. It was the perfect start for Australia and Clarke remained on the attack with two new New Zealand batsman at the crease. But Ross Taylor and semi-final hero Elliott steadied the ship and slowly began to rebuild, with the latter top-edging Starc for a 72-meter six into the leg side. The pair shared a 111-run fourth-wicket partnership and looked to have brought New Zealand back into the match only for the batting powerplay to spark a dramatic collapse. James Faulkner, who is quickly becoming one of the best powerplay and death bowlers, was brought back into the attack and immediately had Taylor caught behind for 40. The 24-year-old Tasmanian deceived the batsman with a slower ball and Brad Haddin took an exceptional low catch, diving to his right, with the ball dying on him. Two balls later the heavy-hitting Corey Anderson was sent back to the pavilion having failed to score as he was beaten for pace as the ball came back off his pads and shattered the stumps. A double-wicket maiden in a World Cup is impressive, a double-wicket maiden in a powerplay to induce a collapse is sensational and looked to be the potential match-winning moment. Five out quickly became six as wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi’s time at the crease lasted just six minutes as he edged Starc to Michael Clarke at first slip for a four-ball duck – the first two overs of the powerplay accounting for three wickets and just a single run. Meanwhile, Elliott – fresh from his semi-final match-winning unbeaten 84 - continued to time the ball sweetly as all those around him played as if they had never picked up a bat before.

Australia's Steve Smith attempts an acrobatic catch after a shot from New Zealand's Grant Elliott . And, whereas Clarke’s one-day international swansong was going to plan Daniel Vettori could only muster nine before a full in-swinging yorker from Johnson hit the 36-year-old’s pad and rattled onto the stumps. New Zealand were crumbling and Elliott having effortlessly moved to 83 became Faulkner’s third victim of the afternoon as he mistimed his shot and an outside edge was gleefully taken by Haddin. When needed most, the Black Caps tail failed to wag and the final wicket run-out perfectly summed up both side’s days up to that point. Boult defended a short Johnson ball to Maxwell at short leg and in a single move the allrounder picked up the ball and hit the non-striker’s stumps. Tim Southee’s bat stuck in the ground and he was run-out, as New Zealand stumbled to 183 all out. It was telling that Australia leaked just 12 fours and three sixes against such a fierce and deep batting line-up and added further proof of their remarkable day in the field. Early wickets were going to be vital if New Zealand were going to make their first World Cup final they have featured in competitive and their best bowler, Boult, delivered.

New Zealand's Grant Elliott bats on his way to 83 - the highest score by any player during the Black Caps' innings . Both Australia and New Zealand stand for the national anthems at a packed Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday . Aaron Finch attempting to push a fuller ball off his legs only succeeded in hitting the ball into his pads, up into the air and into the waiting Boult’s hands. The Kiwi fans, silent for large parts of the first innings, were now making themselves heard but David Warner soon quieted them once again. Warner found the boundary seven times in his 45 off 46-balls before Matt Henry claimed his first wicket of the World Cup having batsman caught at deep square leg, attempting to pull the ball. The loss of the second Australian wicket put McCullum back into an aggressive mindset and Clarke was welcomed to the field with seven catchers and only one man outside the 30-yard circle. But the right-handed batsman was equal to the task and having passed fifty he smacked Southee for four successive fours before chopping on a slower ball from Henry, having made 74 off 72-balls. And, Smith (56 not out) hit his fifth consecutive half-century as the MCG erupted in jubilation as the celebrations begun. It was a disappointing end for New Zealand who had been brilliant with the bat and ball and in the field throughout the World Cup. But the day and night belonged to the Australians who once again were crowned as the best one-day team in the world.","New Zealand batted first but set Australia a target of just 184 to win after a disappointing innings .

"Amir Khan insists the time is not right for a fight against Kell Brook - because nobody in America knows who the Sheffield welterweight is. Brook called out his British rival after stopping Jo Jo Dan in four rounds in the first defence of his IBF world title. But Khan has his eyes on bigger fish, despite promoter Eddie Hearn booking Wembley for June 13 should the Bolton man has a change of heart. Amir Khan (left) has rejected the chance to fight Kell Brook in June at Wembley because of Ramadan . Brook defended his IBF Welterweight title against Jo Jo Dan after knocking him down four times . He told fighthype: 'No one in America knows who Kell Brook is, whereas I can't walk the street without it getting crazy, everyone knows who Amir Khan is but it's a nice thing. 'June I can't do because of Ramadan, maybe that's why he's calling me out because he knows that I can't do June. Maybe the end of the year it could be done, I fight twice a year but that's because Ramadan falls right in the middle. 'I've seen his performance against Jo Jo Dan and he's going on like beating Jo Jo Dan is like beating a five-time World Champion. The Bolton-boxer didn't deny the fight could happen in the future but wants Brook to fight better opponents . The Sheffield fighter has been gunning for Khan for a number of years and feels he deserves a shot . 'He was fighting a b, c-class opponent, no disrespect to Jo Jo Dan but Kell is now a world champion and he needs to fight world class opponents, the likes of the [Keith] Thurman and you have big names in the welterweight decision but he's picking and choosing who he wants to fight.' Khan has made it clear he wants a big fight in America to really boost his profile and is targeting two of the biggest names in the sport to give him what he wants but refused to deny that the Brook won't happen sometime in the future. 'Whoever they put in front of him, he beats, so you can't really disrespect that but the fight between me and him won't happen until the end of the year or maybe next year. It's a fight I know that is going to happen but not just yet because I'm taking a different route. Khan is more focused on fighting the big names like Floyd Mayweather (right) and Manny Pacquiao . 'My route is to fight the big names like the Manny Pacquiao's and the [Floyd] Mayweather's and be amongst those names and also to fight in America and bring my name up over here. 'I just have to keep on doing what I do and keep putting on great performances for my fans. Whatever fights the fans want to see, I'll give it to them. 'The Thurmans and the Brook fights will happen so I'll never say no to any opponent - like the [Marcos] Maidana fight and I was one of the first guys to beat him and the first guy to put him down.","Amir Khan admits his route is to fight world class fighters in the future .

"World Cup winners Australia could arrive in England this summer with arguably the most fearsome pace attack in Test cricket since the ferocious West Indies sides of the 1980s. Less than 48 hours after claiming their one-day prize, the Aussies turned their attention on the summer's Ashes series. While captain Michael Clarke might have marked Sunday's final triumph over New Zealand by confirming his retirement from the 50-over game, his desire for Test cricket success burns as bright as ever. Team Australia celebrate after winning the Cricket World Cup in Melbourne . World Cup hero Glenn Maxwell is the glaring omission despite starring on Australia's run to the final . Clarke was still recovering from a day-long champagne party with fans on the streets of Melbourne when the Aussies confirmed their squad to play a Test series in the West Indies before arriving in England for the start of the Ashes in July. And if Alastair Cook & Co still have nightmare memories of the way they were blown apart by the pace of Mitchell Johnson as they suffered a 5-0 whitewash in Australia, then there is a new nightmare to come. Australia could have as many as four bowlers who have all logged speeds of 90mph plus in their line-up, with both Johnson and his World Cup pace partner Mitchell Starc in the squad. They will be backed up by Ryan Harris, who misses the West Indies trip to stay home for the birth of his first child but will then join up in time for the Ashes. While 24-year-old James Pattinson is also not on the list because he is currently out with a damaged left hamstring, he will also be monitored with the chance to be included in time to travel to England. Player of the tournament Mitchell Starc has been included in Australia's fast paced attack for the Ashes . Mitchell Johnson's pace bowling terrorised England as Australia ran out 5-0 victors  last year . Clarke will lead a side anxious to rub away bitter memories of their last Ashes tour when they were beaten 3-0 in 2013. World Cup batting hero Steve Smith, who averaged only 38 in that series, is a far improved batsman now and will be expected to get big runs. First Test . Cardiff (Jul 8-12) Second Test . Lord’s (Jul 16-20) Third Test . Edgbaston, (Jul 29-Aug 2) Fourth Test . Trent Bridge (Aug 6-10) Fifth Test . The Oval (Aug 20-24) WHEN WILL ENGLAND NAME THEIR SQUAD? Not until after three Tests in the West Indies and two at home to New Zealand, ending in June. David Warner, axed from the early Tests and sent away in disgrace after throwing a punch at Joe Root in a nightclub, will also want to make his mark on the series. National selector Rod Marsh told cricketaustralia.com.au: 'The Test team has performed very well in recent times, but the big challenge is to do that away from home. 'We believe this squad has sufficient depth for these important Test matches against the West Indies and England and will give us the best chance of success.' Two players who starred in the World Cup campaign, Glenn Maxwell and James Faulkner, were tipped for the squad but have missed out. 'Adam Voges and Fawad Ahmed had sensational seasons at domestic level and their performances just couldn't be ignored. They thoroughly deserve their call-up and the opportunity to be a part of this squad. We believe that both can play important roles in the side if required. 'Adam had one of the great seasons in Sheffield Shield history. He is an experienced player and quality character who will add talent and leadership to the touring party. 'Fawad has worked incredibly hard on his game and has demonstrated throughout the season that he can be a consistent wicket taker. 'Peter Nevill has been on our radar for some time and deserves his opportunity through weight of runs and performances behind the stumps. He has also demonstrated impressive leadership qualities which have caught our eye.' Michael Clarke (capt) Age 33 . Caps 108 . Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more. David Warner .

Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. James Faulkner . Age 24 . Caps 1 . Verdict Played his only Test to date at The Oval in 2013, where he got up England’s noses by accusing them of boring batting. A left-arm seam-bowling all-rounder, he can give the ball an almighty whack. James Pattinson . Age 24 . Caps 13 . Verdict Injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011-12, but the talent is undeniable: tall, aggressive and fast, he should trouble England more than his brother, Darren, when playing for England in a single Test against South Africa in 2008. Peter Siddle . Age 30 . Caps 56 . Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. Brad Haddin (wkt) Age 37 . Caps 63 . Verdict Australia’s second-most important cog in their 5-0 Ashes wheel in 2013-14, after Mitchell Johnson. His sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team. Chris Rogers . Age 37 . Caps 20 . Verdict This will be his last hurrah in a late-blooming Test career. Calm, compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner Warner. Steve Smith (vice captain) Age 25 . Caps 26 . Verdict One of world cricket’s rising stars, he scored four tons in Australia’s recent home series against India. Will captain the side full-time after Clarke retires, and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg-spin. Nathan Lyon . Age 27 . Caps 39 . Verdict A steady off-spinner who troubled England’s right-handers  during whitewash. But, really, they should have nothing to fear. Mitchell Starc . Age 25 . Caps 15 . Verdict Another left-arm seamer, and Man of the Tournament at the World Cup. His yorkers are as dangerous in Tests as they are in ODIs, and  accuracy and pace have improved. Ryan Harris . Age 35 . Caps 27 . Verdict If he can drag his injury-laden body through one final series, Australia will be thrilled. He was an unsung star during their 3-0 defeat here two years ago, and produced the ball of the series to bowl Cook in Perth. Josh Hazlewood . Age 24 . Caps 3 . Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. Fawad Ahmed . Age 33 . Caps 20 . Verdict The Pakistan-born leg-spinner has played only three one-day internationals and two Twenty20 games for Australia, so would represent a risk. But Australian leggies have done well in England before… . Michael Clarke (capt) Age 33 . Caps 108 . Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final.

"They reached the FA Cup quarter-final under the radar - escaping attention with victories over Huddersfield, Cardiff and Derby County in the early rounds. Next month a convey of cars and buses will make the 37-mile trip down the M4 to watch Steve Clarke’s team play the mighty Arsenal in an FA Cup semi-final. Reading are back on the map now. This was a brutal destruction by The Royals, as close as it comes to a complete tactical masterclass at this level of the game. They were ruthless against Bradford.

Good for Clarke and his assistant Kevin Keen, the men who controversially changed all 11 players for their 4-1 defeat at Watford last Saturday. Who will remember that score now? ‘We sneaked in under the radar, but I’ll be more excited about an FA Cup semi-final nearer the time,’ revealed a dead-pan Clarke. It was hardly champagne popping stuff, but that is Clarke’s nature after a coaching career that has also taken him to Newcastle, Chelsea and West Brom. He left the celebrations to the fans. By the end this place was raucous, with jubilant Reading supporters spilling on to the pitch at the final whistle. A spine-tingling opening ten minutes had seen a goal from former Arsenal trainee Hal Robson-Kanu and another from winger Garath McCleary put Reading in command. Jamie Mackie’s strike in the 68th minute was reward for his endeavour, a fabulous finish after locking on to Nathaniel Chalobah’s delayed pass. By then Bradford were down to ten men, chasing shadows after Filipe Morais was sent off for raking his studs down the body of Chalobah. Silly boy. The sharpest minds were in Reading’s team, with the soothing voice of captain Alex Pearce at the back containing and nullifying the threat of Jon Stead and James Hanson. On a night like this you have to feel for Bradford’s fans, delayed in traffic for hours on the way to the Madejski Stadium. In the end Phil Parkinson’s team never got out of first gear. ‘Are you Chelsea in disguise?’ sang Bradford’s fans, hoping beyond hope for a comeback similar to the one they experienced at Stamford Bridge last month. It was there that they beat Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea 4-2, recording one of the greatest FA shocks of all time. They needed one more super-human effort, calling on Gary Liddle, Billy Knott, Stead and Hanson to provide the resistance against this rampant Reading team. They could not cope. Reading went in front after six minutes and it is here that the romance begins for Robson-Kanu as he prepares to play his former club on the game’s biggest stage. The winger was released from Arsenal in 2004, the year the Invincibles went an entire season unbeaten on the way to clinching the Premier League title.

Here nobody could touch Robson-Kanu and he beat Bradford captain Stephen Darby at the near post to put Reading in front with a terrific header from eight yards. The place erupted as Reading took control. Three minutes later they scored again. McCleary darted in from the right and when his shot took a deflection off the leg of Andy Halliday, the ball looped beyond the hands of Bradford keeper Ben Williams. It shattered Parkinson’s dreams, his formation splintered by the class of Danny Williams and Chalobah in the centre of Reading’s midfield. Next month’s semi-final is another chance to shine, as Clarke prepares for Wembley’s wide open spaces with a team that is tactically cute and comfortable in possession. Reading have been to Wembley for play-off finals, but it is 88 years since they played in an FA Cup semi-final. This is Arsenal’s specialist competition — winning the trophy five times under Arsene Wenger and making Wembley a second home. When the Royals arrive, they will deserve the red carpet treatment.

"Gary Lineker took a cheeky swipe at Bradford City as Phil Parkinson's side fell to a 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final replay defeat against Reading on Monday night. The BBC has come in for criticism after overlooking the League One club despite their stunning upset of Chelsea in the last 32. Bradford's Twitter account also posted a tweet aimed at Lineker and fellow BBC presenter Mark Chapham following the club's 2-0 giant killing against Sunderland in the next round.

"Fresh from being crowned World Cup champions, Australia have announced their 17-man squad to face England in the Ashes this summer. Alastair Cook and Co face a daunting prospect in trying to reclaim the urn they surrendered with such a whimper last year, especially with pace men Mitchell Starc and last year's danger man Mitchell Johnson in their prospective bowling line-up. Here, Sportsmail's cricket expert Lawrence Booth assesses the intimidating Australian squad man-by-man. Michael Clarke (capt) Age 33 . Caps 108 . Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more. David Warner . Age 28 . Caps 36 . Verdict Could win a Test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions. Moeen Ali’s off-breaks will be crucial in pinning him down. Likes to say a word or two. Shane Watson . Age 33 . Caps 56 . Verdict Has a decent record in Ashes cricket, but has never reached the stage where he frightens England. But his medium-pace balances Australia’s team in a way Cook can only envy. Shaun Marsh . Age 31 . Caps 12 . Verdict A gritty left-hander, and son of former Test opener Geoff. Began Test career with 141 in Sri Lanka in 2011, but success has been sporadic since then. CV includes six ducks. Mitchell Johnson . Age 33 . Caps 64 . Verdict If England haven’t got over the trauma of the 2013-14 series, when Johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece, the Ashes will stay with Australia. Josh Hazlewood . Age 24 . Caps 3 . Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. James Faulkner . Age 24 . Caps 1 . Verdict Played his only Test to date at The Oval in 2013, where he got up England’s noses by accusing them of boring batting. A left-arm seam-bowling all-rounder, he can give the ball an almighty whack. James Pattinson . Age 24 . Caps 13 . Verdict Injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011-12, but the talent is undeniable: tall, aggressive and fast, he should trouble England more than his brother, Darren, when playing for England in a single Test against South Africa in 2008. Peter Siddle . Age 30 . Caps 56 . Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. Brad Haddin (wkt) Age 37 . Caps 63 . Verdict Australia’s second-most important cog in their 5-0 Ashes wheel in 2013-14, after Mitchell Johnson. His sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team. Chris Rogers . Age 37 . Caps 20 . Verdict This will be his last hurrah in a late-blooming Test career. Calm, compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner Warner. Steve Smith (vice captain) Age 25 . Caps 26 . Verdict One of world cricket’s rising stars, he scored four tons in Australia’s recent home series against India. Will captain the side full-time after Clarke retires, and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg-spin. Nathan Lyon . Age 27 . Caps 39 . Verdict A steady off-spinner who troubled England’s right-handers  during whitewash. But, really, they should have nothing to fear. Mitchell Starc . Age 25 . Caps 15 . Verdict Another left-arm seamer, and Man of the Tournament at the World Cup. His yorkers are as dangerous in Tests as they are in ODIs, and  accuracy and pace have improved. Ryan Harris . Age 35 . Caps 27 . Verdict If he can drag his injury-laden body through one final series, Australia will be thrilled. He was an unsung star during their 3-0 defeat here two years ago, and produced the ball of the series to bowl Cook in Perth. Josh Hazlewood . Age 24 . Caps 3 . Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. Fawad Ahmed . Age 33 . Caps 20 . Verdict The Pakistan-born leg-spinner has played only three one-day internationals and two Twenty20 games for Australia, so would represent a risk. But Australian leggies have done well in England before… . Michael Clarke (capt) Age 33 . Caps 108 . Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more. David Warner . Age 28 . Caps 36 . Verdict Could win a Test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions. Moeen Ali’s off-breaks will be crucial in pinning him down. Likes to say a word or two. Shane Watson . Age 33 . Caps 56 . Verdict Has a decent record in Ashes cricket, but has never reached the stage where he frightens England. But his medium-pace balances Australia’s team in a way Cook can only envy. Shaun Marsh . Age 31 . Caps 12 . Verdict A gritty left-hander, and son of former Test opener Geoff. Began Test career with 141 in Sri Lanka in 2011, but success has been sporadic since then. CV includes six ducks. Mitchell Johnson . Age 33 . Caps 64 . Verdict: If England haven’t got over the trauma of the 2013-14 series, when Johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece, the Ashes will stay with Australia. Peter Siddle . Age 30 . Caps 56 . Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. Mitchell Marsh . Age 23 . Caps 4 . Verdict A rangy all-rounder and younger brother of Shaun, Marsh stunned England during the World Cup with figures of 5 for 33 at Melbourne – despite having taken only six ODI wickets until then. His batting is the stronger suit. Peter Nevill . Age 29 . Caps 0 . Verdict Peter who? Nevill has been chosen as the reserve wicketkeeper behind his New South Wales team-mate Haddin, although he has also played as a specialist batsman for his state team. Unlikely to get a game unless Haddin breaks a finger. Adam Voges . Age 35 . Caps 0 . Verdict An outsider for a Test debut, but he knows English conditions well – Voges has spent time with Hampshire, Middlesex and Nottinghamshire – and bowls left-arm spin to complement his middle-order hitting.","England welcome Australia for the Ashes on home turf this summer .

"Fiorentina piled on the misery for AC Milan by scoring twice in the last 10 minutes as they came from behind to win 2-1 and put more pressure on Filippo Inzaghi's team on Monday. A superb brace from Felipe Anderson gave Lazio a 2-0 win at Torino which took them clear of Napoli in third place, the Champions League playoff spot, in another of Monday's games. Monday's defeat at Fiorentina heaped more pressure on Filippo Inzaghi . Fiorentina's winning goal came after chaotic scenes at the Artemio Franchi stadium where the referee went off injured and the teams kept playing before he had been replaced, apparently unaware there was nobody in charge of the match. In driving rain, Mattia Destro put Milan ahead against the run of play when he diverted Giacomo Bonaventura's shot into the net from 12 metres in the 56th minute. Milan, who conceded a 95th minute equaliser in a 2-2 draw with Verona in their previous game, held on until Gonzalo Rodriguez headed in Joaquin's cross with seven minutes left.

Referee Carmine Russo was replaced by the fourth official amid confusion shortly afterwards.

"Juan Mata has described Manchester United's impressive opening 45 minutes against Tottenham as 'arguably our best half of the season'. The Spanish playmaker, who was included in Louis van Gaal's starting line-up to face Tottenham after being named on the substitutes' bench for Manchester United's last seven games, was part of the side which raced into a 3-0 lead after just 34 minutes. And Mata, writing in his weekly blog, has said he was extremely pleased with his side's style of play during the opening exchanges of Sunday's match at Old Trafford.

It was arguably our best first half of the season. 'In those 45 minutes we got three goals and we could have scored some more.

'The best way to recover was by playing a good game and winning for the fans, and that’s what we gave to them - to you - against Tottenham, a very good team that we managed to neutralise.' The 26-year-old has called on his team-mates to maintain their focus during United's final nine Premier League games of the season and lavished praise on the Old Trafford crowd. He added: 'We must focus on each of the remaining games, and they are not many, in order to achieve our goal which is to bring the Champions League back to Old Trafford. Mata was delighted with the reception he received from the Old Trafford faithful on Sunday afternoon . 'Some of our rivals are also fighting for the same but I hope this win against Tottenham will give us confidence to perform at our highest level.

"Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has heaped praise on Shinji Kagawa by calling the former Manchester United midfielder 'the sausage in a sandwich'. Klopp decided to bring Kagawa back to the Bundesliga in the summer after the 25-year-old failed to settle into life at Old Trafford. However Kagawa appears to have had no such trouble impressing his manager since returning to Westfalenstadion despite scoring just one league goal since completing a £6.3million move. VIDEO Scroll down to see Kagawa score on his return to Borussia Dortmund . Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp has heaped praise on Japan international Shinji Kagawa . Kagawa sealed a move back to Dortmund after failing to hold down a first-team spot at Manchester United . Klopp, speaking to Uefa's official website, said: 'Shinji is someone who moves so well in the most difficult areas of the pitch, between the two lines of four. 'It's like he is the sausage in a sandwich, because players are coming from all sides.' The 47-year-old German tactician went on to hail Marco Reus for deciding to reject a big-money move to the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich. Klopp added: 'Just how important Marco is, you could see from the extension of his contract. With such a top player, and with our history [financially], you would think a player of his calibre would leave the club at some point. 'But even though the whole world wanted him, he said: ""I'm staying here"". 'I think that was an extraordinary act at such a young age and not normal, so that's why I think he is a great player and a great lad.'

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini will have to pull off the seemingly impossible to avoid being sacked, believes Jamie Carragher. Sportsmail columnist Carragher feels Pellegrini must try to emulate what Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc did against Chelsea in the Champions League if he is to save his job. City travel to Barcelona 2-1 down from the first leg  and it could take something similar to PSG's heroics at Stamford Bridge for Pellegrini to avoid going the same way as Roberto Mancini in 2013.

Carragher, speaking on Sky Sports, said: 'I think he's got a big problem in terms of his job because you only have to look at the owners and how they dealt with Mancini - a man who won the league, I think he won the FA Cup. Pellegrini won a domestic cup and the league in his first season. 'The exact same thing is happening. They're just drifting in that second season.

"The famous weathervane at the Home of Cricket has been damaged during high winds over the weekend. Father Time, who sits above the Mound Stand at Lord's, has been bent almost 90 degrees by strong wind in London. Weekend gales in St John's Wood have knocked the deathly steel figure parallel to the ground, but mercifully still in his elevated roof-top position with scythe and bail on stumps intact. The Father Time weathervane at Lord's has been bent almost 90 degrees by high winds . The famous weathervane has been at Lord's since 1926 after it was presented to the MCC . Father Time is one of the famous features at Lord's and staff are working to get it back to normal . Staff from Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns Lord's, are working with specialists to restore it to its original position as soon as possible. Lord's is due to host its first game of the season on Sunday, April 12 when Middlesex entertain Nottinghamshire in the LV= County Championship. This is not the first time the weathervane has fallen foul of the elements, back in 1992 it was struck by lightning and the subsequent repairs were featured on children's TV show Blue Peter. Father Time was given to MCC in 1926 by the architect of the Lord's Grand Stand, Sir Herbert Baker. During World War II, it was wrenched from its original perch when it became entangled in the steel cable of a barrage balloon. Staff set about trying to repair and restore Father Time to it's original glory . Father Time tweeted to say he had been diagnosed with copper damage and will be undergoing treatment . It was reattached to the top of the Grand Stand where it sat until 1996 when it was relocated to the Mound Stand. The symbolism of the figure derives from Law 16(3) of the Laws of Cricket: 'After the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets.' But he has, as his name indicates, moved with the times - and tweets these days on behalf of Lord's Cricket Ground, including an update on his latest mishap. The two posts read: 'NEWS: I've was felled by high winds last night! Ouch! 'Apologies for my poor grammar in the previous tweet - but I'm not feeling my best after being damaged last night!' Father Time later tweeted: 'I've been diagnosed with copper damage and will be undergoing treatment ASAP.'","Father Time weathervane bent 90 degrees by high winds in London .

"After little more than an hour of a match that was proving difficult for Liverpool, Jordan Henderson removed the captain’s armband from his left bicep and handed it to Steven Gerrard. He did so out of respect. He did so because he recognises that a player who only joined this contest as a second-half substitute remains arguably the finest to have represented the club. But four minutes after the exchange of that iconic piece of elastic came a moment when Gerrard might have felt it appropriate to hand it back. Jordan Henderson scored a second-half winner for Liverpool as they continued their impressive recent form . Henderson runs off to celebrate his winner that moved Liverpool within two points of the Premier League's top four . A delighted Henderson let out a roar for the Liverpool fans in the Liberty Stadium . Henderson's shot was deflected over the top of Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski's head and into the back of the net . Henderson was mobbed by his team-mates after scoring what proved to be the winner in Wales . Swansea: Fabianski 6, Naughton 6.5, Amat 7, Williams 7, Taylor 6.5, Ki 6 (Dyer 80), Cork 6.5, Shelvey 7, Gomis 7.5, Sigurdsson 7 (Emnes 89), Routledge 6 (Montero 73). Subs Not Used: Britton, Nelson Oliveira, Rangel, Tremmel. Liverpool: Mignolet 8, Can 6.5, Skrtel 8.5, Sakho 7, Lallana 6 (Johnson 88), Henderson 7.5, Allen 7, Moreno 6 (Gerrard 64, 6.5), Sterling 5.5, Sturridge 5, Coutinho 7. Subs Not Used: Jones, Toure, Lovren, Lambert, Markovic. Booked: Henderson, Sterling, Moreno. Goals: Henderson 68. Att: 20,828 . Man of the match: Skrtel. Ref: Roger East (Wiltshire) RATINGS BY DOMINIC KING . Jordan Henderson, whose heat map is shown above, produced another commanding performance in Liverpool's midfield - CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE . It was then, 68 minutes into this contest, that Henderson did something that has long been synonymous with Gerrard: he came to Liverpool’s rescue. If it lacked finesse, and owed more to good fortune, a winning goal that narrowed the gap to Manchester United in the fierce battle for Champions League places owed everything to Henderson’s desire and determination. It was an ugly goal, Jordi Amat’s attempted clearance spinning off Henderson’s shin and flying beyond the reach of Lukasz Fabianski. But it was Henderson who made the run in pursuit of Daniel Sturridge’s flick-on and Henderson, after a stuttering first half, who had given Liverpool impetus with his ambition and endeavour after the break. The goal was Henderson's third in the last three Premier League games after his strikes against Manchester City and Burnley . Liverpool recorded their fifth successive Premier League victory ahead of their huge clash against Manchester United on Sunday . Henderson clattered into Shelvey with this kick to the head after just 16 seconds but Roger East opted not to even book him. If Gerrard had an impact, it was his deployment as a holding midfielder that allowed Henderson to get forward. And the fact the goal came so soon after Gerrard’s first appearance in eight games reflected well, once again, on Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers deserves enormous credit for the run of results Liverpool are enjoying. It is now 13 games unbeaten since they lost at Old Trafford in December and six away from home in the league without conceding a goal, an achievement that equals the club record set by Emlyn Hughes and Co in 1972. Rodgers has succeeded where some of his counterparts have failed in addressing the problems of a struggling side. It has been tactically astute leadership. But Rodgers also needed players to step out of Gerrard’s shadow and prove they can survive without him. Nobody has met that challenge with more authority than a young midfielder in Henderson now reflecting on three goals in Liverpool’s last three games. The pressure was on here with Sunday’s game against United at Anfield and a trip to Arsenal to follow. And against a Swansea side displaying a find blend of ambition and graft under the guidance of Garry Monk, Liverpool struggled in that opening 45 minutes. Monk might have been the managerial apprentice but Rodgers would have recognised how well Swansea’s players had mastered their boss’s instructions. They were excellent, using the pace and power of Bafetimbi Gomis to good effect. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet makes a full-stretch save to deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson a goal in the first half . Liverpool's Belgian goalkeeper Mignolet had to make a number of important stops in the first half as Swansea piled on the pressure . Swansea midfielder Wayne Routledge evades a challenge from Liverpool midfielder Henderson . Liverpool, by contrast, were disappointing, with Henderson among those losing possession far too cheaply. Gerrard brought much-needed composure to Liverpool’s midfield. Given how well Liverpool had been playing, the decision to omit Gerrard from the line-up was understandable. He had been injured, after all. And Liverpool started with their usual intensity, the pressing game that is designed to dominate their opponents and stop them playing. But Swansea were managing to attack effectively on the counter, with Gomis accelerating past Emre Can only for Joe Allen to make an important interception. In the end Ki Sung-Yueng had a real chance to score but his header was weak and cleared by the outstanding Martin Skrtel. Liverpool's Raheem Sterling takes on Swansea left back Neil Taylor at the Liberty Stadium .

Henderson looks set to be in charge of the armband for the long term when Gerrard leaves Anfield at the end of the season . Gerrard made a return from injury as he came on in the second half of the Premier League clash in south Wales . VIDEO Monk rues missed chances . Liverpool have kept six straight away clean sheets in the top-flight for the third time in their history, and the first since 1972. The other run came in 1966. Skrtel would make another headed clearance to deny Gomis, who had escaped the clutches of the Liverpool back four to meet a cross from Kyle Naughton with a better header. Swansea were dominating possession and Gomis was proving a proper threat. A neat one-two with Routledge and he was through on goal with only Simon Mignolet to beat, but much to Monk’s dismay his shot was scuffed and Liverpool’s goalkeeper made the save. An effort from Philippe Coutinho aside — it was gathered neatly by Fabianski — Liverpool offered little in response. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge tries to wriggle away from a challenge from Swansea's Jack Cork . Swansea's Sung-Yueng Ki drifts away from Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, who loses his footing . Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel clears the ball under pressure from Swansea centre back Ashley Williams . Swansea were offering plenty, Mignolet making a hugely impressive diving save to deny Gylfi Sigurdsson before Adam Lallana diverted a powerful strike from Jonjo Shelvey to safety with a courageous header. But after the interval Liverpool were better — there was more urgency, more composure, with Henderson very much at the centre of things, even if the arrival of Gerrard from the bench was important. That gave Henderson freedom to bomb on and in the 68th minute he chased a fine ball forward from Skrtel that was diverted into the Swansea box by Sturridge. Sigurdsson attempts a shot from distance for Swansea as Joe Allen and Mamadou Sakho attempt to close him down . Amat and Henderson gave chase, with Amat winning the race but not the contest. It was tough on Swansea and Monk. Rodgers would have admired his former student for the way he prepared his team. Until Henderson’s goal, they looked the more likely winners. But Liverpool, rather like Henderson at that crucial moment, have what teams need come the business end of the season: momentum. So much so that they almost scored again moments before the final whistle, Sturridge sending his shot against a post.","Jordan Henderson scores the only goal of the game in the 68th minute at the Liberty Stadium .

'Finishing second or third would be fine, although we will be hoping (league leaders) Chelsea slip up. Winning the FA Cup is also an objective. I continue my progress. I feel very well at Arsenal.

But it's good to have shown mental strength to come back even stronger and prove that critics do not reach me.' Only Chelsea's Costa and Tottenham's Harry Kane have scored more than Giroud in the league this season and both have played over 500 minutes more game time.

"In seven years as Monaco boss Arsene Wenger was never once distracted by the lure of its famous casino. 'I spent a lot of time on the football pitches, I don't think anyone saw me in there,' said Wenger, as he arrived at the Stade Louis II on Monday night, aware that on his first competitive return to Monte Carlo he will be expected to gamble. Arsenal paid the price for taking risks in the first leg and lost 3-1. As a result history is stacked against them. In the Champions League era, no team has overturned a deficit of two or more goals having played at home first. Arsene Wenger knows he will be expected to gamble when he returns to Monaco for Tuesday night's match . Arsenal manager Wenger walks on the pitch at the Stade Louis II on Monday night ahead of their match . Arsenal will have to shine if they are to reverse the 3-1 deficit to reach the Champions League quarter-finals .

Delve back into the European Cup and Ajax were the last to manage it, when they needed a play-off to beat Benfica in 1969. Wenger was still playing for Mutzig in the French third division back then, and Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim was not yet born. 'The statistics are against us, we are conscious of that,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We have to give absolutely everything to make the stats lie. That's our desire. We believe we can do it and I'm confident we will. If we didn't believe we wouldn't be here. Football is not predictable. 'We totally missed the first leg, which was surprising. We did not play well. Sometimes in life if you miss a chance, you do not have a second chance, but we do, so we will play it fully.' But he would not commit to a gung-ho charge from the outset. 'Early goals or late goals but we need full power and must not forget the organisation and structure of the team,' he added. Disturbing stats lay behind the headline stat. Monaco have not lost a European tie at the Stade Louis II for 10 years. And they have not lost one at home by a score which would knock them out since Leeds won 3-0 here, nearly 20 years ago. Arsenal must score three and hope to keep Jardim's team at bay, something they were unable to do in London. Wenger has no shortage of creative flair at his disposal and backed France striker Olivier Giroud, who has scored six in seven, to make amends for chances missed at the Emirates Stadium. It might be easier if Monaco were not so miserly. But this team is built on a stern defence. They have conceded only once in the last 12 home games and did not let in a goal in three home Champions League group games. Despite all this, Arsenal captain Per Mertesacker echoed the idea that belief in the camp is strong, and has been improved by a team meeting in the aftermath of the first-leg defeat, three weeks ago.

'A lot of things went not so well in the first game, especially a few decisions which did not go for us. 'We know in the first leg we weren't up for it mentally. From the start you could feel that there was a bit of pressure and we couldn't cope. 'We feel like after that game we moved on and improved a lot. That is why we are confident that even away from home, we can beat any team in the world. 'Obviously we did something wrong to get that result but we can learn. We need a good performance. It is not going to be easy, but we would like to show a different face.' Arsenal vice-captain Mertesacker (right) joined Wenger at the press conference on Monday ahead of their tie . Mertesacker echoed Wenger's idea that belief in the camp is strong despite their 3-1 loss in the first leg . Monaco turned on the charm on Monday night. Vice-president Vadim Vasilyev met Wenger on his return to Stade Louis II and presented him with a framed collection of photographs to mark his time at the club. Wenger seemed more concerned about the state of the pitch and went out to inspect, even though his players had trained in England, earlier in the day. He came back with a positive pitch report. Arsenal's support in the 18,000-capacity stadium is expected to be boosted by their French fan-base, which is another by-product of the Wenger years, and they can cling to one positive statistic: the Londoners have not lost in 10 games in France. Even then, it might not be enough. 'Paris Saint-Germain knocked out Chelsea and showed the quality of work being done here in France,' Monaco boss Jardim warned. 'Who knows, this might be the year when France beat the English.' Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev presents Wenger with a framed collection of photographs on Monday .

"Lewis Hamilton, the winner of Sunday’s Australian Grand Prix, has told Formula One’s cynics that the rules of the sport should not be ripped up to slow him down. The world champion was replying to Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who called on the FIA to limit the superiority of Hamilton’s Mercedes team to make the season a more even fight. Horner’s view was supported on Monday by Bernie Ecclestone, the sport’s commercial boss, who said: ‘Red Bull are 100 per cent right. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian Grand Prix win after he finished ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg . The British Formula One star appeared in good spirits as he was pictured at Sydney Airport on Monday . ‘There is a rule I think (former FIA president) Max Mosley put in that in the event of a particular team or engine supplier doing something magic, which Mercedes have done, the FIA can level up things. Mercedes have done a first-class job. We need to change things a little bit now. ‘What we should have done was frozen the Mercedes engine and leave everybody else to do what they want so they could have caught up. We should support the FIA to make changes.’ The indications  were that the FIA, the sport’s rule-makers, will not rush to act on Ecclestone’s words, which may have been intended primarily to soothe Red Bull, whose motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said they might walk away in light of rules that ‘will kill the sport’. Hamilton, celebrating his 34th career victory in Melbourne, detected an irony in Red Bull’s criticism. Also on the podium was Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel who, as a Red Bull driver, won four consecutive championships from 2010. On Sunday it was third-placed Vettel’s turn to finish more than half a minute behind Hamilton and his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton and Rosberg finished more than half-a-minute ahead of third-placed Sebastian Vettel on Sunday . Hamilton sprays champagne after winning the opening race of the year; his seventh win from the last eight . VIDEO Hamilton cruises to victory in Australian GP . Hamilton said: ‘I was sitting next to Sebastian after the race and I said: “Sebastian, you did this for four years. You were 30 seconds ahead. So I know how it must have felt back then.” ‘He had nobody behind pushing him. At least I’ve got my team-mate, who I was really racing. I don’t remember that ever being the case with Red Bull.’ Ouch, even though Mark Webber did sometimes push Vettel, and not all of the German’s championships were comfortable, with his first title coming down to a four-way decider in Abu Dhabi. Hamilton added: ‘If you want to put someone in the same car, there is no doubt where I would be finishing. People say it’s all the car. Well, it’s a big team that built this car. I’m the one who has to get in and extract the best from it. There has never been a driver that has won the championship that hasn’t had a great car that year. There’s nobody who had a Marussia and won the world championship, is there? Fangio still had a great car.’ Former Red Bull racer Mark Webber interviews his old boss Christian Horner ahead of Sunday's race . Horner's Red Bull have threatened to withdraw from the sport if changes are not implemented . Hamilton’s views will be shared by those who believe Mercedes should be allowed to reap the rewards for their hard work, but Red Bull’s Marko said: ‘We will evaluate the situation again in the summer. If we are totally dissatisfied, we could contemplate an F1 exit. ‘Yes, the danger is there that Mr Mateschitz (the owner) loses his passion for F1.’ Meanwhile, Ecclestone has said Manor must pay for not putting out a car in Melbourne. The team, who blamed software problems for not turning a wheel, believed they had met the terms of their contract and would collect £28million in prize money by turning up in Australia.

"With their exit from the FA Cup against Arsenal, Manchester United's attention now rests solely on their Premier League campaign. Supporters won't expect Louis van Gaal to be winning any silverware this season, but a top four finish is a must for a club that invested heavily in the summer. Is that now a realistic possibility, though? United haven't beaten a side currently in the top half of the Premier League since their home win against Liverpool in mid December last year. Manchester United face a testing final 10 games in the Premier League, they'll play all of their rivals . Louis van Gaal has won less than half of his games against side's in the top six of the Premier League . To make matters worse, they now face the prospect of playing four of the top six in their next five games (and all of them before the end of the season). With Liverpool just a point behind United in the league, and Tottenham a further two points behind them, Van Gaal knows he can't afford to slip up. His record against the top six, though, is not especially encouraging. A fortuitous win at Arsenal and comfortable victory against an out-of-form Liverpool are the only notable moments. Monday's FA Cup tie proves the Gunners will be no pushover and Liverpool are unbeaten in the league since their loss at Old Trafford in 2014. With just 10 games to go until the end of the campaign - half are away from home and half are against direct rivals - Van Gaal and his side will need to show considerably better form to secure Champions League football next season. After Angel di Maria's red card against Arsenal, United will be without their record signing for the next match . United will have to stop the league's most in-form striker when they face Tottenham in their next game . Tottenham (H) - Sunday March 15 . These two sides drew 0-0 at White Hart Lane earlier in the season but with the Premier League's most in-form striker among Spurs' ranks this will be a stern test for United, who will be without the suspended Angel di Maria. Liverpool (A) - Sunday March 22 . A formidable proposition for Van Gaal. Liverpool haven't lost in the league in three months and have won nine of their last 11 matches. Aston Villa (H) - Saturday April 4 . A month ago United fans would have considered this an easy win but Tim Sherwood has reinvigorated Villa, who have now won their last two games in all competitions. Liverpool have not lost a Premier League game since they were beaten by United in December 2014 . United still have to host their fiercest rivals, and Premier League champions, Manchester City . Manchester City (H) - Sunday April 12 . United lost to their rivals 1-0 at the Etihad Stadium, City aren't in the most convincing spell of form but they are the Premier League champions nonetheless. Chelsea (A) - Saturday April 18 . Away at the league leaders. This isn't a match Van Gaal can rely on getting anything from. Everton (A) - Sunday April 26 . Everton have struggled this season but Goodison Park is always a difficult place to go, as United know well from recent history. A trip to league leaders Chelsea will be arguably the most difficult challenge of United's season . Arsenal's win at Old Trafford in the FA Cup quarter-final suggests this will be a difficult match for hosts . West Brom (H) Saturday May 2 . Arguably the easiest of their remaining games, but Tony Pulis will make sure West Brom don't go down without a fight. Crystal Palace (A) - Saturday May 9 . Alan Pardew's Palace are a force to be reckoned with at Selhurst Park. Arsenal can testify to that - the Gunners were fortunate to escape with three points when they visited and so will United. Arsenal (H) - Saturday May 16 . Arsene Wenger's side are in fine form and their win at Old Trafford in the FA Cup quarter-final suggests this will be a difficult match for hosts. Hull City (A) - Sunday May 24 . After an abysmal start to the season, Steve Bruce's side are finally finding some form and have only lost once in their last five matches.","Manchester United have to face Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea in their next five games (and Arsenal later down the line)

"Three months ago Francis Coquelin was surplus to requirements at Arsenal, now the French midfielder is considered so vital to their plans he's forced to play even if not fully fit. The 23-year-old was involved in a collision with team-mate Olivier Giroud against Everton at the weekend that left him with a fractured nose and bloodied shirt.

"A Michigan man who was recently charged with possession of child pornography is now a 'person of interest' in his stepdaughter's murder. Family members and investigators believe James Turnquist, 47, has 'knowledge pertaining to' the death of Julia Niswender, according to the Ypsilanti Police Department. Niswender was suffocated and drowned in her bathtub in December 2012. James Turnquist, 47, is now a 'person of interest' in his stepdaughter's 2012 murder after he was arrested on February 26 for possession of child pornography . Lt. Deric Gress said Turnquist has yet to give police a formal account of where he was in the days leading up to Niswender's murder and is thus now a 'person of interest'. Turnquist previously spoke out against the way his stepdaughter's homicide case was being treated by police and told 7 Action News a few months ago that the family didn't 'like the way they are handling it'. Julia Niswender was suffocated and drowned in her bathtub in 2012 . No suspects have been named in Niswender's murder. Turnquist was arrested on February 26 and is now in jail on $100,000 bond for unrelated child pornography charges. He has been charged with one count of possessing sexually abusive material involving a child.

'I have no idea why they're trying to link my dad to this case,' she told the Detroit Free Press. 'I feel like they have been kind of after him the entire time and we have no idea why.'

"He was the best-paid footballer of his time – but it turns out that retirement is far more lucrative for David Beckham than his glory days on the pitch. The former England captain, 39, made £50.5million last year, despite having hung up his football boots in 2013. US magazine Forbes puts him second in a list of the highest-earning retired athletes after basketball star Michael Jordan, 52, who took £67million in 2014. Scroll down for video . David Beckham at a photocall during the filimg of a Diageo advert from its new single grain whisky, Haig Club, which the former footballer endorses . After Beckham ended his 20-year football career, his earnings were ‘supercharged’ by two deals that netted him more than £13.5million last year. It says: ‘Beckham was the top-paid player in soccer, including endorsements, for most of the last dozen years of his career. ‘But in his first full year of retirement, Beckham posted the highest earnings of his career with $75 million [£50.5 million] in 2014. His previous high was $51 [£34.3 million] in 2012.’ One was with drinks giant Diageo to launch Haig Club whisky. The other was with the Global Brands Group in Hong Kong to create his own branded products such as clothes and luxury goods. The former England captain has also fronted a campaign for H&M underwear, right, and has a partnership with Coty, which sells Beckham fragrances . Forbes said: ‘The deals also have significant potential thanks to Beckham’s ownership stake in the ventures. ‘Beckham remains one of the top product pitchmen in sports, with a dozen deals to his name, including four in China.’ Other endorsements include Adidas, Sky Sports, Breitling watches and Samsung. He also has a partnership with the cosmetics firm Coty, which sells Beckham-branded fragrances such as Instinct worth more than £67million a year. Forbes said the contract, which runs into 2017, makes an estimated £4million annually for Beckham. The former footballer in an advert for Armani. His earnings were ‘supercharged’ by two deals that netted him more than £13.5million last year . It added: ‘Beckham partnered with Swedish retailer H&M in 2012 for a line of bodywear. The venture expanded with swimwear in 2014. 'A new line of menswear this year will expand product offerings, as well as Beckham’s take. Doing business with Brand Beckham tends to be good business for everyone involved.’ Marc Ganis, president of consultancy Sportscorp, told Forbes: ‘These athletes created brands for themselves before people focused on brands. Bechham starring in an advert for Pepsi alongside Modern Family star Sophia Vergara in the US . ‘Their brands received a tremendous amount of free publicity every time they were on TV or reporters wrote about them. Some of them converted that brand into a lot more than a free car at the local dealership.’ Beckham earned a £1.95million-a year base salary with US club LA Galaxy in 2012. He retired from the sport in May 2013 after five months at French club Paris Saint-Germain, where he donated his £170,000-a-week salary to a children’s charity.

"Lukasz Fabianski revealed Swansea's players were in shock after striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed against Tottenham and admitted the incident had scared him. The French forward lost consciousness during the match at White Hart Lane on Wednesday and while Gomis made a full recovery Fabianski insisted it had left the player shaken. 'From the moment when I saw something was wrong it was when Bafe was already on the floor and you could feel that everyone was in kind of shock,' said Fabianski after the match. 'But from what I heard he's OK now so hopefully everything is OK.' Lukasz Fabianski revealed Swansea's players were in shock after Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed against Spurs . Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham . Concerned Tottenham players look on as the Swansea forward is attended to by medical staff . When asked if seeing his team-mate like that scared him, Fabianski replied: 'Obviously, it was a shocking moment, especially because it's the same ground where something similar happened before, you just don't want the same thing to happen. Those kind of things go through your mind.' Swans midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson added: 'I asked the doctor and he said he was OK and hopefully would recover. Hopefully he will be back with us soon. 'It's never nice to see someone go down like that. We have a good medical team and they came on to the pitch very quickly. Swans midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson said he was looking forward to having the striker back in the team . Gomis is helped by French goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso after the collapse in Guincamp . Players and staff call for help after then-Lyon striker Gomis collapses during a match in 2010 . 'It will be really nice to have him back, he's an important player for us.' Shocking as it was, it wasn't the first time Gomis has experienced such a collapse. In 2009, Gomis lost consciousness in both a pre-season friendly match with Lyon and during a training session with the French national team. He also lost collapsed during a match between Lyon and Monaco in 2010, after which he said: ‘I had an incident early in the game. I often do early in the season. I immediately felt good after that. I think it was related to stress and the desire to resume the season.’ A vasovagal syncope, which is what Bafetimbi Gomis suffered on Wednesday night, is caused by a sudden decrease in blood pressure or heart-rate, triggered by emotional or physical factors. Reduced blood flow to the brain makes a person faint. It can be prompted by extreme exertion or anxiety. On the physical side, there are numerous tests that can be done when a player has a medical and it appears Swansea knew all about Gomis’s history. They will have checked the flow through his blood vessels under exercise stress, though emotional triggers are harder to quantify. It is a rare condition for a professional sportsman and is more common in older people. It is not something I have encountered in any other footballer. Thankfully, it is not an especially dangerous condition in isolation. The risks are low beyond what happens when you fall. You could hit your head or suffer trauma damage to another part of the body on landing. Often there is a stimulus that the person will recognise and they can act, by sitting down. Most sufferers feel fine in a matter of moments.","Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed at White Hart Lane on Wednesday .

Pellegrini's side have struggled in recent months, winning just four of their last 11 matches in all competitions. But the league champions will be hoping to build on last week's win when they travel to Turf Moor by winning back-to-back games for only the third time this year. City are currently five points behind table-topping Chelsea in the Premier League, although Jose Mourinho's men have a game in hand.

"March 16, 2014. Liverpool travel away from Anfield for a game that will shape the destiny of their season and Brendan Rodgers' confidence is telling. 'If we beat them, they cannot do it,' Rodgers proclaims ahead of a trip to Old Trafford. He had just been asked what the consequences would be if Manchester United, who were trying desperately to keep pace in the race for the Champions League, lost to Liverpool. His words are backed up by a swaggering display, full of devilment, wit and counter-attacking menace. Manchester United are left punch-drunk by a 3-0 defeat that could have been even heavier, as Steven Gerrard – with two pressure penalties – and Luis Suarez ran amok. Steven Gerrard scored two penalties as Liverpool won 3-0 at Manchester United on March 16, 2014 . Luis Suarez (bottom) was also on the scoresheet as Liverpool built a 14-point gap over their arch-rivals . Liverpool headed home that afternoon with a 14-point gap over their rivals in the Barclays Premier League and had effectively destroyed any lingering hope that David Moyes had of commandeering a top four spot. It was a day when Rodgers saw his players make a massive statement of intent, a day that suggested there was a shift in the balance of power of this rivalry; leaving Old Trafford then, you felt it would be a long time before the deficit would be clawed back. Fast forward to March 16, 2015. Again Liverpool were away from Anfield for a vital fixture and again Rodgers' confidence in the build-up was telling but, this time, there was no performance of verve and invention to back up his pre-game message. There was, however, doggedness, determination and the result was just as crucial. Jordan Henderson's freak goal, coming after they had spent much of a rain-sodden night in South Wales riding their luck and defending for their lives, has set them up for another afternoon of destiny with their most bitter foe. Jordan Henderson scored a second-half winner for Liverpool as they won 1-0 at Swansea on Monday night . Henderson runs off to celebrate his winner that moved Liverpool within two points of the top four . Henderson's (right) shot was deflected over the top of Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and into the net . The goal was Henderson's (right) third in the last three Premier League games for Liverpool . No trophy will be presented at Anfield next Sunday but there is the sense that the winner of Liverpool and Manchester United's latest showdown will take all in relation to the final spot in next year's Champions League. It is going to be another day of reckoning. Do not underestimate how much Liverpool needed this result at the Liberty Stadium. They have stylishly worked their way into contention for the top four with a long unbeaten run but United's victory over Tottenham had threatened to alter the landscape. What if a loss in Wales and had then be follow up with a defeat at Anfield? Such a scenario would have left bleak consequences for Liverpool. Those result would have left them with an eight-point deficit and not enough time to claw it back, especially with some tricky assignments looming. As it is, they go into English football's Clasico brimming with confidence, two points behind United but ready to leapfrog Louis van Gaal's men. They will need to step up on what they produced against Swansea to topple United but Rodgers has a glint in his eye and faith in his team. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge (centre) tries to wriggle away from a challenge from Swansea's Jack Cork . Liverpool might not have last year's electric swagger but they certainly know how to fight and, in some ways, the results they have put together since losing at Old Trafford on December 14 have been just as impressive as their unexpected title-charge. Nobody proved that determination more than Henderson, who emerged from a difficult first 45 minutes to keep on running and score the decisive goal, his challenge on Jordi Amat looping over Lukasz Fabianski's head to leave Rodgers' punching the air. Henderson keeps on producing these important moments. For all the noise that is being created around Raheem Sterling and his contract stand-off, the most pressing contractual issue Liverpool have is with their vice-captain. He has scored in each of his last three Premier League games and has led the team with distinction in Gerrard's absence. Young, hungry, talented English players like him are not ten-a-penny and it would be folly to let this drift. Liverpool should really get this business concluded.

"Mohamed Salah sent out a message to parent club Chelsea after scoring twice in a 2-1 win against Juventus to take his goal tally at Fiorentina to six in seven matches. The Egyptian's brace in Turin earned his side a slender lead to take into the second leg of their Coppa Italia semi-final and condemned Juventus to their first home defeat in 48 matches. Salah scored his first 11 minutes in when he sprinted past three defenders and dribbled for 60 yards before launching in a shot from inside the area.

Fernando Llorente then equalised with a superb header in the 24th minute, but Salah scored the winner in the second half with an angled shot inside the box. Since moving to Italy on loan, Salah has scored three goals in Serie A, one in the Europa League against Tottenham, and two in the Coppa Italia. The Egyptian was used as a bargaining tool in Jose Mourinho's deal to bring Juan Cuadrado from Florence to London but has already outshone the Colombian, who is yet to score in five appearances for Chelsea. Blues midfielder Eden Hazard was clearly impressed with Salah's performance, tweeting after the game: 'Momo Salah on fire.' Lazio and Napoli drew 1-1 in the other semi-final on Wednesday.

"Sebastian Coe has warned against calls from the Ukrainian president to boycott World Cup 2018 in Russia over the conflict between the two nations. Lord Coe is challenging Ukraine's pole vault icon Sergey Bubka for the presidency of world athletics governing body the IAAF, to replace Lamine Diack, who steps down in August. Coe, the former chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG), believes sporting boycotts only 'damage competitors and athletes'. Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko told German newspaper Bild the country's allies should consider boycotting the 2018 FIFA tournament in Russia if Moscow does not pull all of its troops out of his territory. Lord Sebastian Coe believes that boycotts only serve to 'damage competitors and athletes' 'I will always oppose boycotts of sport, because I don't think they actually achieve what they set out to do,' said Coe. 'The only people they really damage are competitors and athletes.' Poroshenko told Bild he will push Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel towards tougher sanctions against Russia, citing the fact Shakhtar Donetsk are forced to host matches 1,200km away in Lviv because their home city is occupied by pro-Russia separatists. 'I think there has to be discussion of a boycott of this World Cup. As long as there are Russian troops in Ukraine I think a World Cup in that country is unthinkable,' Poroshenko told Bild. Coe, however, believes politicians should use sport as a 'soft power' to try to bring about change through inclusion rather than exile or boycott. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko wants Russia to withdraw all troops from his territory . Conflicts have been ongoing between Ukraine and Russia, leading to a call for a 2018 World Cup boycott . 'I think it is far better to have sport as a soft power, helping change all sorts of things, and we can't pick, we can't a la carte menu sport,' said Coe. 'You either believe in its power to change and to be a catalyst for social and political change or you don't. 'I happen to believe that sport has done far more to bring communities together than to isolate and separate them.' Coe was back at the centre of the triumphant 2012 Olympic Games on Monday, the Olympic Park, to launch the 2015 Morrisons Great Newham London Run. The 10k run will be held on Sunday, July 19, and will be the first event staged in the former Olympic Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Coe rates coaxing more young people into athletics as the greatest challenge facing the sport, and his ideas to boost participation form the crux of his manifesto for the IAAF presidency. The double Olympic gold medal winner said it was important he took time out of his hectic campaign schedule to continue the legacy work from London 2012. 'I will support anything, particularly running, but anything that adds to the lustre and legacy of this extraordinary park,' said Coe. Brendan Foster (left), Jo Pavey, Coe and Mayor of Newham Robin Wales pose for a photo at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London to launch the Morrisons Great Newham London Run 2015 . 'It's 10 years since the IOC's evaluation commission were through here. 'We've delivered a Games but that was never the end of the story, it was always about making sure this was a living, breathing community, with sport at its absolute epicentre. 'It's an extraordinary thing to help launch.' Attempts by the Football Association to resurrect the Team GB football side for the 2016 Rio Olympics look under threat, amid opposition from Irish and Welsh bosses. The Football Association of Wales and Irish Football Association are understood to oppose any moves for the return of the Team GB XI. Coe admitted the British Olympic Association (BOA), which he chairs, is locked in talks to back the FA's stance but refused to be drawn beyond that. 'The British Olympic Association is obviously in discussion, I chair the BOA and that's something we're looking at, and I know discussions are taking place,' said Coe. 'But we will see where that gets to. 'I know from my own experience of having chaired the organising committee that that is a complex process, but I'll leave that to my colleagues at the BOA and the home nations to figure out. 'Consensus is always better than disagreement, but it really is a matter for the home nations and the British Olympic Association.'","Lord Coe believes nobody should boycott the next World Cup in Russia .

"He may be without a club at present but that hasn't stopped Ravel Morrison linking up with whom many refer to as the best player on the planet. Morrison, who had his contract terminated at West Ham last month, bumped into Barcelona superstar and 'maestro' Lionel Messi while out and about on Monday afternoon. The chance occasion was clearly one the 22-year-old didn't want to miss out on as a photo was taken with the four-time Ballon d'Or winner before being uploaded to Instagram. Ravel Morrison (left) uploaded an Instagram photo after posing with Lionel Messi (centre) on Monday . Lionel Messi (left) was in London on Sunday night enjoying a double date with Cesc Fabregas .

Honours: FA Youth Cup (2011) Accompanied with the caption: 'Out and about with the maestro and reece @leomessi,' the duo are all smiles as they pose for a picture. While Messi, who was in London on Sunday night with girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo and former Barcelona team-mate Cesc Fabregas and his partner Daniella Semaan, is continuing to break records this season Morrison is just a mere spectator. The 22-year-old, who has signed a pre-contract agreement with Lazio, is a free agent. Ravel Morison has had his contract terminated at West Ham ahead of his summer move to Serie A side Lazio . However, the midfielder cannot represent another club this season as he has played in two countries - England and Wales - this term and FIFA don't allow a third. Morrison only made two appearances under Hammers boss Sam Allardyce this season; with his last outing coming in a 3-1 home defeat to Southampton back on August 31. A series of disciplinary problems had hampered his progress at Upton Park and he was loaned to Birmingham, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City - with his three-month deal at the latter cut short earlier in December. However, the England Under 21 international will now look to resume his career in Italy next season. Like our Barcelona Facebook page.

"West Ham will return home from their mid-season break in the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, but not before a spot of shopping in Dubai. The Hammers' squad had a week off from Premier League action, and were treated to some sunshine after their topsy-turvy first half of the season. Sam Allardyce's men started magnificently, hovering around the Champions League places, but have since dropped off with one league win in 2015. Enner Valencia, Adrian and Cheikhou Kouyate (left-right) pose for a photo at The Dubai Mall . On West Ham's mid-season break to Dubai, Diafra Sakho took to the tennis court in the  sunshine .

On their trip, the players have spent time playing tennis and relaxing in the 30 degree heat, and Monday saw them take to the shopping mall for some last-minute spending before they return home. Cheikhou Kouyate, who joined the east London club for £7million in the summer, was one of the players in attendance, and he later uploaded a photo to Instagram alongside team-mates Adrian and Enner Valencia.

"Lionel Messi's hunger at Barcelona was questioned during the first half of the season, but the Argentina superstar showed an appetite of a different kind is still intact on Sunday. Fresh from scoring a hat-trick in their 6-1 La Liga victory over Rayo Vallecano earlier in the day, the 27-year-old was spotted in London at the Colony Club Casino Bar. Messi visited the Mayfair exclusive hotspot with girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo as they enjoyed a double date with Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas and his partner Daniella Semaan.

The Colony Club has a casino room for American Roulette, Blackjack, Three Card Poker and Baccarat . The restaurant inside the exclusive Mayfair nightspot is open seven days a week from 7pm until late . The happy couples have been close for years following Fabregas' return to Barcelona from Arsenal in 2011. Fabregas subsequently moved to Chelsea last summer but the quartet's friendship evidently remains as Messi and Roccuzzo flew from Spain to spend time with the Spain international and Semaan. But any chance of Messi and Fabregas' rekindling their on-the-pitch partnership seem remote for now following comments from Barcelona's international sporting director Ariedo Braida. Messi leaves the field with the match ball after netting a 12-minute hat-trick on Sunday . The Argentina international netted his first of the afternoon from the penalty spot . Messi celebrates after finding the bottom corner with his spot kick to make it 3-0 to Barcelona . Speaking to Catalan TV channel Esport 3, Braida says the club will do everything they can to keep Messi at the Nou Camp but accept they may not be able to match a potential offer from a bigger-spending club. Messi who is Barca's all-time top scorer, is tied to the Catalan giants until June 2019 and has a £205 million release clause in his contract. When asked about the dimunitive No 10's future, Braida said: I believe it's very difficult that Messi will leave Barca but at times in football strange things happen. 'Now with these clubs that have so much money like (Manchester) City, certain amounts don't seem to have a value. 'In football things happen that appear impossible but I hope he will remain.' The 27-year-old taps home from close range in front of a packed Nou Camp as Barca went top of La Liga . Barcelona forward Messi looks to the sky as he celebrates following his second goal against Rayo Vallecano . Messi claimed earlier this year that he was happy at Barca and quashed speculation that he would leave the club this summer. The Argentina international created a new hat-trick record in Spain by scoring three goals in Barca's triumph over Rayo - his 24th league treble for Barca in all competitions. The outcome at the Nou Camp lifted Luis Enrique's team to the top of Primera Division, just one point clear of Real Madrid, who lost 1-0 at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. Messi has enjoyed an outstanding campaign, scoring 30 goals and setting up 14 more in 26 league appearances. 'He is not just a player,' Braida added. 'Messi is a phenomenon, he is an alien.'

"Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz has warned Chelsea they won't achieve success by simply sitting back when the two sides meet at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. The first leg of the Champions League tie ended 1-1, meaning a goalless draw would be enough to send Jose Mourinho's side through to the next round. But Luiz, who spent three years in west London before his £50million summer transfer to PSG, said it would be foolish of his old club to invite pressure on themselves considering the strength of the Ligue 1 champions' attacking options. David Luiz has warned his old club Chelsea of the dangers of simply sitting back against Paris Saint-Germain . Luiz spent three years in west London before his £50million summer transfer to the French champions . 'I know how Jose (Mourinho) will prepare for this, he will be telling the boys to be patient and hit us on the counter attack,' Luiz told The Mirror. 'He knows that we need to score and that they don't, I know that is his way. We must be careful because I know that Chelsea have the ability to hurt on the counter attack, but they must be careful as well. 'To sit back and just defend against Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), (Edinson) Cavani and (Ezequiel) Lavezzi can also be very dangerous, so it is not just us who have to be careful.'

"Shocking new images have emerged showing the risks taken and the injuries sustained by the young  men who jump on to and off speeding trains in Mexico in a desperate attempt to reach the United States. The majority of those attempting to hitch a ride on the trains are from Central American countries like Honduras and El Salvador who are willing to risk their lives for the opportunity to work illegally in menial jobs should they ever actually reach the U.S.. Referring to America as 'the promised land' the train hoppers that manage to make it on to a speeding locomotive are seen clinging on for dear life as they tear through the countryside of northern Mexico to the border they stand little to no chance of actually making it across.

Making a jump: A man is seen either jumping or falling off of a speeding train as it passes through the Mexican countryside near Tabasc . Treatment: A seriously injured young man is taken to hospital by medical workers after a failed train jump near the city of Tabasco . Recovery: Raul Ordonez Martinez, 42, is seen recovering after having both legs amputated at the Municipal Hospital Emiliano Zapata. Raul had both legs amputated after he tried to jump on a moving train in Tenosique . Before the U.S.-bound trains appear on the horizon, the young men are seen relaxing and sleeping on the railway tracks of northern Mexico. Many of them have already travelled thousands of miles from countries deeper in South America - but their journey is far from finished. While many of the young men wait near train stations so they can jump on to trains that have yet to build up speed, others consider that approach fair to likely to raise the suspicions of the driver or platform guards. Instead they wait out in the Mexican countryside, where they are unlikely to have been spotted and make the death-defying leap on to trains speeding along the rails. While many somehow manage to make it on to the trains, others are unsurprisingly dragged beneath the 36-inch steel wheels and crushed to death. One of the biggest threats to the young men's lives is exhaustion. Having already travelled thousands of miles and spent several nights clinging to trains or sleeping in the open, when the time comes for them to make the all-important jump, their bodies fail them and they either fatally miscalculate the leap, or else suffer life-changing disabilities.

Wedged between cargo cars, perched on tanker tops, stuck in stuffy boxcars, with money sewn into shirt cuffs and pants hems, they hop on, often in daylight, high noon even, because arresting impoverished migrants has not, historically, been a top priority in Mexico . Making the leap: While many of the young men wait near train stations so they can jump on to trains that have yet to build up speed, others consider that approach fair to likely to raise the suspicions of the driver or platform guards . Dozens of desperate young men die every year jumping on to U.S.-bound trains in Mexico. The majority have come from poverty-stricken countries such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and are aged in their late teens or early 20s. Another thing unites the men too - their all or nothing desire to start new lives in the United States where, as illegal immigrants, they are unlikely to find work other than as exploited, below-minimum-wage workers in restaurants, cleaning and maintenance businesses and on building sites. 'The trains are for the poorest of the poor,' says Carlos Miranda, a migration expert in the southern state of Chiapas. 'If they thought they had any other choice, they would take it.' Nobody knows precisely how many migrants take the trains, but on certain days, in the most popular train towns - Arriaga, along the southern Pacific Coast, and Tenosique, a modest farming town south of the Yucatan - you will find hundreds, even thousands, of people waiting by the tracks. If they are lucky, they will hang on long enough to make it to Mexico City, where they switch lines in the massive train yards, and then in dwindling numbers head out again, pushing north to the U.S. border, or as close as they can get. The risks are enormous: They must navigate a spidery network of aging rails — the trains themselves sometimes jump the tracks — through jungles and deserts and mountains, searing heat and icy rain. They face attacks by the bandits and gun-toting gangs that patrol the trains, and must hop off and on at immigration checkpoints, risking limb and life each time. The trip can take weeks, or months, if you allow for all the pitfalls and stopovers to earn a few pesos for food. Death-defying: Mexico tries to catch the train hoppers before they enter the country. But the southern border is porous, and, says Mexico's immigration commissioner, Hipolito Trevino, 'we cannot stop them all' Nobody knows precisely how many migrants take the trains, but on certain days, in the most popular train towns - Arriaga, along the southern Pacific Coast, and Tenosique and Tabasco (pictured) - you will find hundreds, even thousands, of people waiting by the tracks .

The majority have come from poverty-stricken countries such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and are aged in their late teens or early 20s .

New life: A train jumper with a missing leg is seen using crutches to travel through the Mexican town of Tabasco earlier this month . Forty million people live in Central America, and nearly half are poor. In Honduras, 46 per cent live in extreme poverty. In Guatemala, 130,000 lost their homes in Hurricane Stan. El Salvador is crippled by drought, and in Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, the majority of the people have little or no work. This is why they come. Mexico tries to catch the train jumpers before they enter the country. But this southern border is porous, and, says Mexico's immigration commissioner, Hipolito Trevino, 'we cannot stop them all.' How many lose arms or legs along the way? Impossible to know - not everyone is counted. Wedged between cargo cars, perched on tanker tops, stuck in stuffy boxcars, with money sewn into shirt cuffs and pants hems, they hop on, often in daylight, high noon even, because arresting impoverished migrants has not, historically, been a top priority in Mexico. Women and children are most vulnerable, to both the elements and to the men, and are usually the most difficult to spot. If they can, they wait for the trains to stop in the dusty yards then make a dash for it. You can find them hiding in the dark hollows of the hopper cars, the children wide-eyed, their mothers fingering the family Bible.","Young men are seen clinging on for dear life as the trains tear through the countryside of northern Mexico .

"Manchester United have joined the running to sign Burnley striker Danny Ings. Louis van Gaal sent chief scout Jim Lawlor to watch Ings play against Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday night after the 22-year-old scored at Old Trafford in February. Liverpool were favourites to sign the England Under-21 forward in January with his contract ending this summer, but Brendan Rodgers has competition to bring him to Anfield. Manchester United have joined the running to sign Burnley striker Danny Ings after sending scouts to watch . Ings (centre) has been Burnley's star player as they try to stay in the Premier League this season . Ings scored for Burnley against United in his side's 3-1 defeat and impressed with his display .

But Burnley would receive about £6million in compensation if Ings joined another club in England, while a move abroad would net the second-bottom  side just £300,000. It would cost £43m for United to make Radamel Falcao's season-long loan from Monaco permanent, and Ings is a cut-price option. The starlet was reluctant to leave Burnley in January but becomes a free agent after May. Manchester City contacted his representatives in February and want to sign Ings to boost their homegrown quota. The  champions bought Wilfried Bony from Swansea City for £25m, rising to £28m, in January but Juventus have shown interest in Stevan Jovetic, while Edin Dzeko could leave for Wolfsburg. The loss of Frank Lampard to New York City and possibly James Milner would leave Manuel Pellegrini short of home talent, and Ings could fill the gap. Louis van Gaal sent chief scout Jim Lawlor to watch Ings play against Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday . The £5million compensation would be far cheaper than the £43m they would have to pay for Radamel Falcao .

"Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has no future at Arsenal and should move on for the sake of his international career, according to former Liverpool stopper Jerzy Dudek. The former Anfield man, a fellow countryman of Szczesny, believes that Arsene Wenger will always choose David Ospina and the Polish keeper should move on to improve his chances of playing for his country. 'It's a serious matter,' Dudek told Poland's TVP Sport. 'Fortunately, we have two other goalkeepers who are able to provide an adequate level in our goal. Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has played second fiddle to David Ospina since the turn of the year . Jerzy Dudek believes that Szczesny should move on for the sake of his international career with Poland . 'In excellent form is Lukasz Fabianski and, on the other hand, Artur Boruc is very experienced. I think [Adam] Nawalka [Poland manager] will wait to make the decision until the very end. 'Wojciech is the least likely to play in the match with Ireland. If I were in his place, I would wonder whether there are still opportunities to arise at Arsenal and wouldn't wait as long as Fabianski, because you can see that Arsene Wenger is firmly set on David Ospina.' Fabianski (Swansea) and Boruc (on loan at Bournemouth from Southampton) are both goalkeepers with Premier League experience and, perhaps more importantly, regular first-team game-time this season.

Dudek believes that Szczesny is below Lukasz Fabianski and Artur Boruc in the Poland pecking order . Szczesny started the season as Arsenal's No 1, but was dropped after being caught smoking in the showers at Southampton on New Year's Day. Since then, he has made just three appearances for the Gunners, all of which in the FA Cup.

"Sebastian Vettel paid an emotional homage to Michael Schumacher for providing the inspiration for his maiden victory with Ferrari. Four-times world champion Vettel was highly emotional as he stood on top of the podium after taking the chequered flag in the Malaysian Grand Prix in only his second race with the Maranello marque. Not since Schumacher's last triumph with the Scuderia at the Chinese Grand Prix in 2006 have the German and Italian national anthems been played back to back to hail such a combined Ferrari success. Sebastian Vettel (centre) jumps for joy after his impressive Malaysian Grand Prix win with Ferrari on Sunday . Vettel (centre) holds up his trophy as Lewis Hamilton (second left) and Nico Rosberg (second right) applaud . Vettel revealed it was former Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher who inspired his skillful win in Malaysia . For Vettel, it was the realisation of 'a dream' sparked by his hero Schumacher who won five of his seven titles with Ferrari, but who suffered life-changing injuries following a skiing accident 15 months ago. 'The team has been phenomenal, welcoming me the first day,' recalled Vettel. 'I remember when the gate opened in Maranello it was like a dream coming true. 'I remember the last time I was there was as a young kid watching Michael over the fence driving around in the Ferrari, and now I'm driving that very red car. It's incredible. 'Of course, when I grew up Michael was my hero, and for all of us - and I speak for all of the kids at the go-kart track at the time in Germany - we looked up to him. 'When he turned up every year, and to look after us a little bit, it made our lives. 'So that's why I think...I probably don't understand yet how special it is. Very, very emotional.' Vettel's win was no fluke, beating Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in a straight fight as he made good use of better tyre wear in the 30 degree heat at the Sepang International Circuit. Schumacher (right) celebrates winning the Malaysian Grand Prix with team-mate Rubens Barrichello in 2000 . Following Mercedes' domination last season, when only technical woes denied them victories in all but three of the 19 races, and after an easy win in the season-opening event in Australia, this defeat came as a surprise to reigning champion Hamilton. 'Huge congratulations to Seb and Ferrari,' said Hamilton, who finished 8.5secs adrift of Vettel at the end of the 56 laps. 'You have to hand it to them - I wasn't expecting them to be as quick as they were. They had some serious pace and deserved the win.' Rosberg, meanwhile, was left chewing on his words as a fortnight ago after the race in Australia he had called on Ferrari to give them a fight. It was a case of 'be careful what you wish for', with an unhappy Rosberg stating: 'Ferrari did an awesome job and deserved to win.

Team-mate Jenson Button retired 21 laps later with a turbo issue, leaving neither of the team's cars classified for the first time since the 2006 United States Grand Prix. Although three laps down, Manor's Roberto Merhi saw the flag, a triumph for the team who unfortunately had to withdraw Will Stevens ahead of the race after failing to fix a fuel pressure problem.","Sebastian Vettel revealed Michael Schumacher was the inspiration for win .

"Dressed in supermarket-branded loungewear, unemployed Ronnie Moore would look out at his freshly-trimmed lawn with a washing-line full of cottons blowing above it and wonder if his future lay in the kitchen rather than the dugout. Sacked by Tranmere Rovers last April having admitted an FA charge of breaching rules regarding betting on matches – a ‘joke’ he calls the whole affair - the Scouser was at rock bottom. Meanwhile, 150 miles north of Liverpool in Hartlepool, the town’s football team had themselves plunged new depths. Bottom of League Two having lost seven of the previous eight, their proud status as residents of the Football League since 1920 was under threat. Ronnie Moore reacts in the touchline as his Hartlepool side continue to fight for survival in League Two . In December, they turned to Moore, a month shy of his 62nd birthday. It was a long-shot for both parties. ‘People must have thought I was crackers coming in here,’ he says on the eve of a home match with Cambridge which could see Pools emerge from the relegation zone for the first time since October. ‘But I had been out of work for eight months. I knew how to wash up, hang washing out, what heat your cottons should be on. My back garden was like bloody Wembley. I was even going shopping and looking for the cheapest thing – the own brands. ‘Others might not have given me the chance considering all the crap that was written. ‘I was not going behind people's backs betting thousands of pounds on things. It was nothing but a family syndicate. The whole thing was a joke. Marvin Morgan (left) celebrates scoring a winning goal for Hartlepool in February against Northampton . ‘So just to be given the opportunity when no-one wants you, just to get back in, that drives you on.’ Within a few weeks, however, Hartlepool had fallen 10 points adrift of safety. They had still not won under Moore’s care. He had been horrified when it took 15 minutes during his first training session for the team to string five passes together and commented, ‘We’ve got some f****** bad players.' He had some harsh words for them in public, too. ‘I have sent out a circular to say we have players available but I don’t expect my phone to be red hot to be honest,’ he said in January. ‘Where do they think they are going to go at the end of the season? They are not going to Real Madrid. ‘One of them might go to League One, but one or two of them might be working in Asda. Hartlepool, who are currently bottom of League Two,  have won their last three matches . ‘These lads don’t have a clue what life is about. They go home at 1pm, get their feet up and watch Home & Away. All we can try to do is wise them up.’ Wise up and shape up they have. Indeed, three wins in a week without conceding has moved them to within one point of safety. ‘From where we were, to keep us up would have to be the best thing I have ever done as a manager,’ says Moore. ‘It would be better than my two promotions at Rotherham. Everyone thought we were dead and buried.’ There have been dressing-room dressing-downs for several players, including former Newcastle and West Ham striker Marlon Harewood. He even accused some of having ‘a heart the size of a peanut’ and told them there would be no days off until they won – he had to renege on that threat after four games. Hartlepool players celebrate during a return to form in recent months and can still survive relegation . Neil Austin has seen seven managers during six years at Victoria Park. The 31-year-old defender admits Moore was exactly what was needed. ‘As soon as he walked through the door he got respect straight away,’ he says. ‘He knows how to treat players. People might have thought some of his comments were harsh, but given the league position you couldn’t argue. ‘We had a harder job trying to work out who the League One player was - because everyone else was heading for Asda!’ Hartlepool are expecting their biggest crowd of the season on Saturday after cutting ticket prices to as low as £10. Hartlepool have taken Preston striker Jordan Hugill for the rest of the season on loan . Austin adds: ‘Survival is massive for the town. The club is part of the town and its identity. ‘This is a proper Football League club with a proper, old-school ground. Too many grounds now feel a bit fake, a bit like a Subbuteo set. ‘Here, you can smell the Bovril coming from the terraces when you’re playing and we want it bouncing again tomorrow. We’re all in it together now and we will stay up, I’m sure of it.’ Should Austin prove right, Moore will no longer feel the need to air their dirty linen in public.","Hartlepool are bottom of League Two, but now only one point from safety .

"The Premier League has been the loudest opponent of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar switching to a winter tournament — staged from November 21 to December 18 — that will be rubber-stamped at the FIFA ExCo meeting in Zurich on Friday. But the richest league in world football is not expected to kick off yet again when the dates become official this week. The PL is resigned to that decision being a formality since the opinions of PL chief executive Richard Scudamore and other European leagues chiefs were virtually ignored at the task force summit in Qatar which recommended a November-December competition. The dates from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar are expected to be confirmed on Friday in Zurich . Qatar will host the 2022 World Cup in the winter despite opposition from Europe's big leagues . Instead, the PL and their European counterparts will be concentrating on winning concessions for such a disruption to their calendar. The biggest confrontation is likely to be with their own UEFA confederation over tightening the Champions League programme. This not only spreads itself over a ridiculous four weeks for their last-16 round but also forbids domestic fixtures taking place on those nights. The PL will also be wanting talks about cutting international friendlies, FA Cup replays and two-legged Football League Cup semi-finals in that season. But more conflict looks inevitable as the FA and Football League will not want their broadcasting deals affected by losing fixtures. However, a December 18 finish would see the Premier League restart on Boxing Day. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has been among the loudest critics of a winter World Cup . The Global Sporting Director Summit at the Etihad Stadium on April 29 has attracted former England cricket managing director Hugh Morris, who hardly put a foot wrong during his low-profile tenure that included three Ashes victories, as well as Paul Downton, who hasn’t put a foot right since taking charge in January 2014. If the beleaguered Downton were to take any advice from Morris he would surely be told to do his work behind the scenes rather than at centre stage all the time. Hugh Morris (left) and Paul Downton (right) will both be at the Global Sporting Director Summit in April . The Football League are certainly in the right place if they were ever to be worthy of News at Ten attention. Having been evicted by the Premier League, their new offices in London’s Gray’s Inn Road are next door to the ITV news studio in the ITN building. And the complex production role of supplying content from all three lower league divisions in time for the 9pm Channel Five highlights show next season will be handled by ITN. Jason Leonard, RFU president from June, was surrounded by rugby fans on the Twickenham concourse before the Scotland game. It showed rugby definitely got one decision right — fast-tracking Leonard to be president during the World Cup, rather than some anonymous suit. And England Rugby 2015 will be making the most of Leonard being the Twickenham kingpin. Jason Leonard will take up his role as RFU president from June ahead of the Rugby World Cup . Moore’s tweet revenge . Only loveable BBC rugby co-commentator Brian Moore could go on Twitter seemingly to embarrass his own employers. Moore said on air that England scrum-half Ben Youngs was his choice as official BBC man of the match against Scotland. But Moore then went on social media to tell followers: ‘Just to point out I picked (Courtney) Lawes as MoM but Youngs came up and had to deal with it.’ A BBC spokesperson said the right graphic of Youngs was screened and was correctly announced and that Moore stood by his decision. No he didn’t on Twitter. Former Chelsea and Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon is busy advising Premier League promotion hopefuls Middlesbrough, having brought in the club’s first foreign manager Aitor Karanka. He is also running global football funds with super agent Jorge Mendes. Jersey-based Kenyon is also playing an influential role as chairman of burgeoning rugby agency Esportif. UEFA have put out a banal YouTube interview with president Michel Platini answering recorded questions that would have created derision if Sepp Blatter had done it. To Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas’ probing: ‘Mr President, I’d like to ask if you miss playing football?’ Platini replies: ‘Iker, it’s always a pleasure to see you on TV. Normally, when I see you, I give you a cup.’","A winter World Cup in Qatar in 2022 is expected to be confirmed on Friday .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini praised James Milner's heart and determination and labelled the English midfielder a complete player. Milner is one of few home-grown players in Pellegrini's first-team squad and could be set for a move away from Manchester at the end of the season when his contract runs out. But the City boss was full of praise for Milner and his attitude and commitment. James Milner was praised by Manuel Pellegrini for his attitude, heart and 'big balls' Milner is one of few home-grown players at Manchester City and could be set for a move away . Pellegrini is under pressure to keep his job after watching his City side fall out of the title race . ‘It would be very difficult to find a more complete player than [James] Milner’ Pellegrini said. ‘There are players who are better technically. There are quicker players. 'There are players who head the ball better. But show me a player who does all the things that Milner does well and there isn’t one.' Milner has played 36 times for City this season in all competitions and contributed six goals. The 29-year-old has been in Manchester since a big-money move from Aston Villa in 2010, but his stay at Eastlands could be drawing to a close as his current deal is up in the summer. Milner has scored six goals for Manchester City this season in 36 appearances for the club . Pellegrini described Milner as a complete player and said it is difficult to find someone better . The 29-year-old has played in almost every position since his big-money move from Aston Villa in 2010 . Pellegrini added: ‘And whatever position I put him in he plays well: at full-back – which is the only place he doesn’t like playing– attacking midfield, wide, or as a striker. I used him this season as a forward and the team was scoring three goals a game. ‘You leave him on the bench and he is furious, but watch him during the game, encouraging and shouting. And in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes. 'It’s very difficult to find another Milner – an intelligent player, with big balls and a massive heart.’ READ OUR FULL INTERVIEW WITH MANUEL PELLEGRINI HERE .","James Milner is one of few English players in City's first-team squad .

"David Moyes' Real Sociedad side ended their long wait for an away win in the Primera Division as they triumphed 1-0 at Getafe. Sociedad were the only La Liga side without a win on the road this season going into Monday's clash at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez, but they finally got that monkey off their backs courtesy of Inigo Martinez's second-half header. The Sociedad academy product rose highest to nod home Esteban Granero's accurate free-kick off a post in the 66th minute, although Getafe keeper Vicente Guaita will be disappointed at not being able to stop it. Inigo Martinez celebrates his second-half header which secured all three points for Real Sociedad . Martinez is mobbed by his Real Sociedad team-mates after scoring the only goal of the game on Monday . David Moyes pays tribute to the travelling fans after Real Sociedad claimed their first win on the road . Moyes' men have moved up to 10th in the table . Victory takes Sociedad up to 10th, level on 33 points with ninth-placed Espanyol, while Getafe remain 13th. Moyes' side, who like Getafe came into this game on the back of two wins and a defeat in their last three matches, saw plenty of ball early on but did little with it. The hosts looked sluggish during the opening exchanges, but they had a penalty appeal turned down in the ninth minute. Pedro Leon cut into the box and just as he looked to get it out of his feet and pull the trigger he was stopped in his tracks by a bumbling challenge from Sociedad centre-back Martinez. Referee Melero Lopez waved away the appeals, but the incident sparked Getafe into life and Quique Flores' side should have taken the lead when Alvaro Vazquez beat three defenders and then disappointingly toe-poked straight at Sociedad's grateful keeper Geronimo Rulli. Leon came within inches of opening the scoring after 20 minutes when he exquisitely curled onto the bar from the corner of the box. Getafe goalkeeper Vicente Guaita dives helplessly as Martinez's second-half header sails past his grasp . Gonzalo Castro (right) and Getafe's defender Alexis Ruano battle for the ball during the Monday night clash . Moyes shakes hands with Getafe's head coach Pablo Franco ahead of the La Liga encounter . Rulli was beaten all ends up as the ambitious shot sailed over his head and he - as well as everyone else - no doubt expected it to miss the target comfortably, but a deceptive dip saw it drop down sharply and clip the frame of the goal. Imanol Agirretxe had a few headed chances as Sociedad began to show more in the final third, but Leon went close with a wicked shot from distance before Diego Castro was bravely thwarted by Rulli in a goalmouth scramble as it remained 0-0 at the interval. Sergio Canales starred as Sociedad upped the tempo in the second half, first rounding three defenders and then forcing a good save out of Guaita, before desperate defending blocked his goal-bound shot from hitting an empty net in the 57th minute. Martinez made the pressure count by leaping highest to head Granero's pinpoint free-kick in with the help of a post as Guaita got close to clawing it away after it bounced off his right upright, but fell just short of getting a good enough contact. With Getafe frustrations boiling over after the goal, Juan Rodriguez protested too loudly when his penalty appeal for a challenge by Martinez and Granero was rejected and he was duly booked by Lopez. The hosts frantically probed for an equaliser late on, with Mehdi Lacen again forcing Rulli into another good save with six minutes remaining, but Sociedad held out to finally get a reward on their travels.","Real Sociedad were the only La Liga side without a victory on the road .

Sturridge, who has been hampered by injuries this season, played 83 minutes of Liverpool's 2-0 win against Burnley on Wednesday night.

"Chelsea striker Diego Costa was involved in yet another confrontation on Wednesday as he appeared to strike Aaron Cresswell during his side's 1-0 win against West Ham. Costa, who was not punished for the incident, has a reputation for trying to unsettle his opponents by throwing his weight around.

I've told our central defenders not to get involved with the fact he might try and upset them. 'He's an old-fashioned type of centre-forward because he seems to like getting motivated on the physical and niggle aspect of it all. I've told them not to get involved in that and get distracted, simply to focus on him in the final third.' Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho's side remain five points clear at the top of the table - with a game in hand - following their win over their London rivals.

"Manchester United's first team stars looked in high spirits as they prepared for their quarter-final clash against Arsenal at the club's Aon Training Ground.

When you win the FA Cup you are not in the Champions League which is important for the club, but you have won a title. So for the players it is fantastic, for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the Champions League. 'I think that for a club the Champions League is the highest level. To finish in the first four is a fantastic result, I think. And for us, Manchester United, more I think.'

"Former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini appears to be under pressure after failing to improve Inter Milan's fortunes since taking up at the reins at the San Siro. Mancini looks a distressed figure on the front cover of Monday's La Gazzetta dello Sport after seeing his side fail to claim all three points against Serie A relegation candidates Cesena. The 50-year-old conceded after his side's 1-1 draw with Cesena that his side were going to struggle to qualify for next season's Champions League.

"Roma's season went from bad to worse after losing 2-0 at home to Sampdoria on Monday to leave Rudi Garcia's team in danger of losing out on second place in Serie A after Lazio won 2-0 at Torino. Lorenzo De Silvestri and substitute Luis Muriel scored to inflict Roma's first home league loss of the season amid loud jeers at the Stadio Olimpico, and the hosts' misery was compounded by Seydou Keita's late red card.

Roma were looking to get back to winning ways after five successive league draws at home and things looked promising in the first half as Sampdoria goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano was forced into a series of fine saves to keep the home side at bay. The visitors took the lead against the run of play on the hour mark when Samuel Eto'o held off two Roma players to pull back from the byline for De Silvestri and the former Lazio defender fired into the bottom right corner. Muriel doubled Samp's lead in the 78th, four minutes after coming off the bench. He sped forward and his initial effort came off the post but Roma failed to clear and Muriel hit the target at the second time of asking.

"Jose Mourinho insists Arsenal can mount a late charge to win the Barclays Premier League title, however statistics from the last 10 years show Chelsea tend to finish the season off in fine form. Premier League leaders Chelsea have dropped an average of just 8.6 points per season during the last 10 years. If the Blues replicate the form they have shown in their last 10 games during previous seasons then Manchester City will not be able to retain the league title even if they claim nine consecutive wins. Chelsea look set to win the 2014-15 Premier League title as the Blues tend to finish the season off in fine form . Chelsea dropped two points against Southampton at the weekend but are still odds-on favourites to win the title . Jose Mourinho insists Arsenal have joined Chelsea and Manchester City in the Premier League title race . 2013-14: 11 points dropped . 12-13: 7 . 11-12: 15 . 10-11: 10 . 09-10: 5 . 08-09: 6 . 07-08: 10 . 06-07: 11 . 05-06: 6 . Average: 8.6 points dropped . Chelsea are seven points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand of both their title rivals . Arsenal are even further behind as they are currently seven points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea, having played a game less than the Gunners. However Mourinho said after his side's 1-1 draw with Southampton: ‘Of course Arsenal are in it. They are seven points behind Chelsea, but have one less match to play than Chelsea. ‘Both City and Arsenal are in the title race. It depends on the momentum for Arsenal - the 3-1 defeat against Monaco or the 3-0 defeat against West Ham? ‘So the danger is always there. But I keep saying, we are there. If someone had told me in August that, at the end of March, we'd be six points in front with a match in hand, I'd have signed for that immediately.' Chelsea would finish the season off with over 85 points (85.4 to be exact) if history is to repeat itself - based on the average number of points they have dropped in their last 10 games of the season. The maximum amount of points Manchester City can ascertain is 85 and that would mean Manuel Pellegrini's side defeating the likes of Manchester United, Tottenham and Southampton. Arsenal, on the other hand, will be on 84 points if they win their remaining nine fixtures of the campaign.

Jose Mourinho says Cech can leave Chelsea if he wishes, but only for big money as he rates him one of the top three goalkeepers in the world. The three most expensive goalkeepers so far: Gianluigi Buffon (£32.6m), Manuel Neuer (£19m) and David De Gea (£18m) – although all were 25 or under when they made their move. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has said goalkeeper Petr Cech can leave Stamford Bridge in the summer . David de Gea, Manuel Neuer and Ginaluigi Buffon are the three most expensive goalkeepers in history . Cech cannot command such a fee at his age. A better marker may be the £9m Liverpool paid for Simon Mignolet. Is Cech better than Mignolet? Yes. So if Chelsea asked for £10m for a 33-year-old reserve, should Arsenal be tempted? Yes again. The absence of a world class goalkeeper is holding Arsenal back. Cech could easily last another four years at the top, making him value at £10m. Pat Jennings was 32 when he switched from Tottenham Hotspur to Arsenal in 1977; he played his last game for the club in 1985 at the age of 39. There has never been a question over his worth and Cech could be as important. Cech is a better goalkeeper than Liverpool stopper Simon Mignolet whom the Reds paid £9million for in 2013 . Pat Jennings, pictured with Liam Brady, spent seven years at Arsenal and played his final game aged 39 .","Petr Cech has been told he can leave Chelsea if he wishes this summer .

"Frank Lampard will be thanking his lucky stars that he decided to postpone his move to New York City FC after seeing future team-mate David Villa's attempt at providing backing vocals for his side's new anthem. The MLS outfit have released a snippet of the music video for their track 'All The Way' which includes contributions by singer-songwriter Sarah Packiam, MC Sterlin and Villa. New York City ace Villa took to Twitter to provide his 6.96million followers with a chance of having a 'sneak peek' at his collaboration with the music duo. David Villa is all smiles as he provides backing vocals for New York City FC's new anthem . The 33-year-old stars in the music video along with Sarah Packiam and MC Sterlin . The full version of the song will be released on Wednesday ahead of New York City's opening game of the 2015 MLS campaign. Villa's first competitive match in America will see the former Barcelona ace go up against Kaka's Orlando City Soccer Club at the Citrus Bowl on Sunday. New York City fans will be hoping his highly-anticipated MLS debut is somewhat better than his laboured music video performance. Packiam and MC Sterlin take to the streets during the music video performance . Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday . Kaka - Orlando City SC . The Brazilian won the Ballon d’Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass. Frank Lampard – New York City FC . One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City. Steven Gerrard – LA Galaxy . The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane. David Villa - New York City FC . Villa became New York City’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York’s goals in their debut season. Bradley Wright Phillips - New York Red Bulls . Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games.

"Harry Kane is the third highest goalscorer in Europe's top five leagues with only La Liga superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi ahead of the Tottenham star. Barcelona ace Messi leapfrogged rival Ronaldo to lead the way as Europe's most potent striker by scoring a hat-trick against Rayo Vallecano to take his tally for the season up to 41 goals in 38 games. Messi, who helped his side to an emphatic 6-1 win on Sunday, has now scored 40 goals or more in each of his last six seasons. Tottenham striker Harry Kane celebrates at Loftus Road after scoring in his side's 2-1 win against QPR . Kane netted a brace in front of the watching Roy Hodgson to help his side claim a crucial win in west London . Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi leads the way after scoring a hat-trick against Rayo Vallecano . Kane's double against Queens Park Rangers on Saturday put him level with Messi's Barcelona team-mate Neymar. Both Kane and Neymar have scored 26 goals in all competitions during the course of the current campaign, with the Tottenham netting 18 Barclays Premier League goals thus far. Kane's rise has been mesmeric. The 21-year-old run riot in his side's Europa League campaign, helped his side seal a spot in the Capital One Cup final and has played a major role in Tottenham's quest to finish in the top four. He is also likely to earn his first senior England call-up later this month when Roy Hodgson, who was at Loftus Road on Saturday, names his squad to face Lithuania and Italy. Mauricio Pochettino heaped praise on his star striker after his side's 2-1 win against QPR by calling the Tottenham star 'fantastic' but stressed there is room for improvement. Cristiano Ronaldo is three goals behind Messi having scored 39 goals during the course of the season . Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette has scored 25 goals while Sergio Aguero has found the net 23 times this season . 'It was a fantastic performance, he scored two goals,' said Pochettino. 'He is young, can improve more and now it is Roy's decision. 'I don't know if (he deserves a call-up). Roy needs to decide whether this it time to pick him or not. 'I think that today was a great game, a great performance. We showed character, I am very pleased for our players.' Alexandre Lacazette, who has been linked with a summer move to England, follows closely behind Kane and Neymar, having scored 25 goals for French outfit Lyon. Premier League top scorer Sergio Aguero, Guingamp striker Claudio Beauvue, Juventus ace Carlos Tevez and Atletico Madrid's Mario Mandzukic make up the rest of Europe's deadliest top nine strikers.","Harry Kane scored a brace in Tottenham's 2-1 win against QPR .

"Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola has refuted reports suggesting he could replace Manuel Pellegrini at the helm of Manchester City. The former Barcelona boss has been linked with a move away from the Allianz Arena as talks over a new contract have been put on hold until the summer.

Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola is happy to stay at the Bundesliga outfit for a 'long time' Guardiola has ruled out the possibility of replacing Manuel Pellegrini at the Etihad Stadium .

'I only feel pressure when I don't see my team playing the right way. 'All the other things are not important. 'When I signed my contract nobody told me about winning five titles in five years.

"The agent of Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic believes his client is capable of playing until he is 43 but does not believe he will end his career in the French capital. Ibrahimovic, 33, has just over a year on his current contract at Parc des Princes and is said to be happy at the Ligue 1 outfit, however his representative Mino Raiola has questioned whether the Sweden international can play another eight to 10 years at PSG. Raiola, speaking to RMC, said: 'Zlatan still has a year and a half on his contract. PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic can play until he's 43, according to his agent Mino Raiola .

'Zlatan told me the first-leg game against Chelsea was perfect. It was a perfectly prepared game. There is a lot of respect between Laurent Blanc and Ibra. I can tell he likes Blanc.'

"Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has changed his mind over his side's main aim this season as the Dutchman is now prioritising Champions League qualification over winning the FA Cup. Van Gaal, who has been criticised during the course of the season for constantly tinkering with Manchester United's tactical approach, said back in February that winning the FA Cup was his side's main objective. The Dutchman, speaking after Manchester United's 3-0 win against Cambridge United on February 3, said: ‘We have a real chance now. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal appears to have changed his mind over his side's main priority . Van Gaal, pictured after United's win against Newcastle, is focused on Champions League qualification . United are currently fourth in the Premier League . ‘Why? We are the highest qualified team in the FA Cup so people are maybe betting on us. I am not allowed to (bet), I am not a casino man – but I give you a tip. ‘Of course, I think the highest qualified teams have more possibilities to win than lower qualified teams. But Arsenal is still in the cup and Liverpool will fight tomorrow (Wednesday, February 4). ‘For me, personally, I have always won a title in my first year everywhere I have worked so the chance of winning the title is bigger in the FA Cup than the Premier League. ‘Every club in the FA Cup wants to win, and so do we. For the club, the fans and the coach and my staff, we want to win a title this year. The biggest chance is the FA Cup, but we still have to win four games to do that.’ Van Gaal, pictured after winning the Bundesliga in 2010, previously said his main aim was to win a trophy . However Van Gaal, speaking ahead of his side's quarter-final clash against Arsenal, now insists finishing in the top four is more important than winning a piece of silverware. Van Gaal said: 'I always want to get the goals what we have set. And the goals we have set is the top four. 'A title is fantastic. When you win the FA Cup you are not in the Champions League which is important for the club, but you have won a title. So for the players it is fantastic, for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the Champions League.

"Manchester United playmaker Angel di Maria failed to live up to his £60million price-tag once again on Wednesday night with his main flaw surrounding his inability to pick out a red shirt. Di Maria, who looked incredibly disappointed after being hauled off in the 59th minute, was Manchester United's worst passer with a passing accuracy percentage of 63.6 per cent. Louis van Gaal's decision to replace the Premier League's record signing with Adnan Januzaj comes just days after Di Maria was hooked off at the interval against Sunderland following another below-par performance against Gus Poyet's side.

Januzaj, who came off the substitutes' bench to replace Di Maria, also seemed to be on a different wavelength to his Manchester United team-mates as his passing accuracy percentage was just 66.7 during the 31 minutes he was on the field of play.

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter has delivered a warning against a boycott of the 2018 World Cup and insisted the world governing body had every right to move the 2022 tournament to the winter. Ukraine's president has called for a boycott of the 2018 tournament in protest at Russian military involvement with pro-Moscow separatists. Blatter responded by claiming the World Cup could actually help bring peace. FIFA president Sepp Blatter insists the 2018 World Cup will take place in Russia . He told a news conference in Zurich: 'What is 100 per cent is that the World Cup will take place in Russia in 2018, that's sure. 'A boycott of the World Cup or any sporting event has never brought any solutions to anybody. 'The European Parliamentary committee is asking for a boycott of the World Cup three or four months ago - it was a boycott of the World Cup in Qatar and now it is the World Cup in Russia. 'In my opinion the World Cup in Russia will be able to stabilise all that region in Europe.' Blatter said he had been buoyed by IOC president Thomas Bach and German FA president Wolfgang Niersbach coming out against a boycott. Asked whether FIFA should apologise for the chaos caused by playing the Qatar tournament in winter, Blatter added: 'This was a decision taken by executive committee of FIFA, they have a right to do it. If something happened the FIFA ExCo can change so we can also say play in winter.' FIFA has also moved to head off opposition from the clubs over playing the 2022 World Cup . FIFA has announced it made a profit of $338m (£227.2m) over the last four years and now has cash in the bank totalling $1.5bn (£1bn). Blatter said reserves that size are needed in case a World Cup, which generates almost all the money for FIFA, had to be moved or postponed. FIFA has also moved to head off opposition from the clubs over playing the 2022 World Cup in Qatar in the winter by trebling the amount clubs who release players will receive for the tournaments from $70m (£47.3m) in Brazil last year to $209m (£141.3m) for Russia and Qatar. Blatter, 79, is standing for a fifth term of president on May 29 and faces three rivals, but has so far not released a manifesto. Asked about that issue, he responded: 'I am not campaigning, I am doing my job as FIFA president and I will do that until last day of my mandate which was given to me in 2011. 'My manifesto is the work I have done in FIFA - I have now been 40 years in FIFA and 17 years as president of FIFA.

Falcao has scored just four goals since joining the Red Devils on a temporary deal - with his latest strike coming against Leicester City on January 31.

"His arms out-stretched in a hero pose, former international footballer Michael McIndoe milks the adulation as a spray of champagne washes over him. The 35-year-old wasn't celebrating a cup triumph but the millions flowing through his accounts from an alleged £30million investment scheme that snared a string of top-flight players. Pictures have now emerged of McIndoe in 2011 - at the height of his scheme - surrounded by beautiful women and empty champagne bottles as he revelled in a millionaire playboy's lifestyle in Marbella with a limitless credit card and wads of cash. Former Wolves and  Coventry player Michael McIndoe celebrates in Marbella during the height of his scheme . A member of staff at the beach bar lifts a Methuselah champagne bottle out of an ice bucket . Another former footballer revealed that McIndoe had spent £40,000 on champagne in one day . McIndoe (second from the right) parties in Marbella using money earned from the elaborate scheme . McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then took advantage of the Bulls' financial plight and snapped him up for £25,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for £50,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for £250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons. But the former Wolves and Coventry midfielder, who is accused of persuading 300 stars including Jimmy Bullard as well as a string of lower league players to invest with him, is now being investigated by police. He was forced into a bankruptcy court with debts approaching £3m earlier this month where he claimed to be penniless and living on the charity of friends and family. The Metropolitan Police are investigating and have started quizzing victims and associates. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' said one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme, which promised a 20 per cent return on investments. McIndoe, from Edinburgh, hired pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club, in London. But it was in Marbella that McIndoe indulged the lavish lifestyle - shown in these exclusive photos - he could not afford as his playing career ended in non-league football. He hired a modernist £2m mansion for £27,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree and spent £40,000 on champagne in one day at a beach club party. Friends had bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs. McIndoe celebrates scoring for Doncaster against Arsenal in the League Cup in 2005 .

The former Scotland B player rented a £27,000-a-week mansion for a three-week holiday in Spain . 'There were lots of girls and lots of drink,' said the player, who had been befriended by McIndoe when he was a young apprentice at the same club. 'He was spending money like you've never seen before.' McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays. The player added that McIndoe targeted fellow professionals and businessmen football supporters and initially gave them the 20 per cent return paid monthly in cash. The scheme sucked in around 300 players and the former QPR and Hull star Bullard is thought to have lost around £600,000 which prompted him to go on the ITV reality show, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. He told original investors to get other 'clients' involved and they would be rewarded.

Large bottles of the expensive Dom Perignon champagne are buried into an ice bucket . Jimmy Bullard (pictured here in 2011) was one of the investors, and is thought to have lost around £600,000 . McIndoe lived at the five-star Mayfair Hotel, paying £4,000 a week for a suite, and also rented a Belgravia apartment for an upfront £150,000 annual fee, it is alleged. He ran glitzy parties at celebrity nightclubs including Funky Buddha, in London, and drove around in a Bentley and a Maybach. He was reportedly gambling heavily before the scheme crashed and is said to have run through £1m on bets with one bookmaker in a year. 'He had the gift of the gab but was very cagey about the scheme, saying the money was in property, gold or City investments,' added the player, who declined to be named. 'People were convinced when they saw him paying out but then he suddenly closed the scheme down. He kept telling me to wait and that I would be a wealthy man.'

Another person to have been caught out by the former Scotland B international was glamour model Georgia Eden, who was one of 30 women hired to attend club nights organised by McIndoe. In total, McIndoe was due to pay the model agency who organised the women £12,000, but the money never materialised. Speaking to the Daily Record, Eden said: 'We were asked to mingle around and talk to guests in the club. The organisers said they were really pleased with what we had done and we were told we would be paid within 30 days. Georgia Eden was one of 30 models hired to attend a event put on at a club by McIndoe . But Eden, along with her colleagues, was never paid for her work with the agency said to be owed £12,000 . McIndoe (right) in action playing for his former club Wolves against West Bromwich Albion in 2007 . 'That date came and went and a lot of excuses were made to the agency. 'To have that amount of girls booked for one job was a really big deal so it was a big let down to not be paid for the work we had done.' McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £2.4m. He told the London bankruptcy court this month that he had no income and was living off £13,900 surplus from the sale of his mother's house but £6,000 of that had been given to his girlfriend, who lives in Epping, Essex. 'That money has been running thin of late so I have been getting help from friends and family,' he told the hearing. He added that he was not working and was living with his mother in Edinburgh or staying with a friend in London. After the hearing, he faced accusations from creditors that he had not responded to their questions about repayment. 'I have nothing to say, I cannot comment about this,' he said. The hearing was adjourned until March 25 and he must attend a meeting with the bankruptcy trustee later this month.

"Celtic were on Friday standing by skipper Scott Brown after images of him slumped on the pavement and apparently drunk on a night out in Edinburgh emerged just days before Sunday's League Cup final. The pictures, published in a tabloid newspaper, were taken after the Scotland captain had allegedly spent Wednesday night drinking with friends in lap-dancing bars in the capital. Brown was also shown eating fast food in the photographs, flying in the face of manager Ronny Deila’s instructions to his players to be ‘24-hour athletes’.

The midfielder was described as being unsteady on his feet by witnesses in Edinburgh on Wednesday . Brown looks to be enjoying his food as he polishes off the pizza while still sitting on the floor . Celtic refused to comment on the reports but Sportsmail understands the Parkhead club are playing down the seriousness of the incident after Deila gave his squad Thursday off. Brown, who has made 42 appearances for his country and is just eight caps away from entering the SFA’s hall of Fame, returned to training on Friday ahead of Sunday’s clash with Dundee United at Hampden. The Scottish Sun reported that Brown was in the Burke and Hare nightclub where he enjoyed the attention of scantily-clad girls and offered to buy dances for fellow drinkers. But he was reported to have had an argument with some of the dancers and a barman had to intervene to calm the situation. Brown then left for the Western Bar where he was refused entry but was successful in getting into the nearby Baby Dolls lap-dancing bar. The Sun reports that Brown was told by a bouncer to 'get some food and sober up' and he went on to fall asleep during a dance.

"Friday 13 didn't leave Mercedes red-faced as they dominated free practice at Formula One's season-opening Australian Grand Prix, but they did emit a crimson complexion of a different kind as they showed their support for Red Nose Day. Last season's F1 World Constructors' Championship champions wore red noses in support for the British charity. Defending World Champion Lewis Hamilton was the only one from the party to not be seen wearing a red nose, but the British racer did wear a T-shirt backing. Mercedes F1 team showed their support for Red Nose Day by wearing merchandise on Friday . Mercedes' drivers Lewis Hamilton (left) and Nico Rosberg both also wore T-shirts in support of Red Nose Day . Rosberg wore the red nose while conducting interviews and signing autographs to fans at Albert Park . Captioned with the slogan 'I think I may be the voice of a generation,' the 30-year-old is all smiles as he poses for photographs with team-mate Nico Rosberg. Rosberg was also pictured wearing a T-shirt, as well as a red nose, for the biennel telethon charity event which takes over the BBC on Friday evening. And Friday's F1 practice proved a good one for the German as he set the fastest lap of 1:27.697secs in the second session on a glorious day at Albert Park, topping Hamilton by one tenth of a second. Rosberg was also quickest in the first session, his best time of 1:29.557secs edging Hamilton as the constructors' champions carried their ominous form from winter testing onto the track. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel was third fastest on his debut for Ferrari in the second session, with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen fourth best.

World champion Hamilton finished behind Rosberg in both practice sessions on Friday . Hamilton takes time out in the garage during the first practice session of the new season . But with Vettel's fastest time over seven tenths of a second adrift of Rosberg, the opening day's practice will strengthen belief that the first rounds of the new season may be a private duel for race wins between the Mercedes duo. At the other end of the grid, and dogged by reliability problems during winter testing, the gloom in the McLaren garage followed drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen onto the track. Magnussen, who has taken injured Fernando Alonso's seat at Albert Park, skidded into the gravel at turn six in the second session and his car had to be winched off the track. That was after he and Button finished slowest of the 15 cars in the first session that posted flying laps. Button improved in the second but only marginally to be 13th fastest.

"One of Britain’s most popular online bookmakers has been branded a ‘rip-off company’ after failing to honour odds offered during a crucial Chelsea match. Furious customers are demanding a bigger payout after placing wagers with Sky Bet that the Premier League leaders would be knocked out of the Champions League by Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night. The firm’s mobile phone app was offering odds of 25-1 for a PSG win in extra time – but when it came to settling the bets, they paid out at just 9-2. It means the winnings for a £10 wager would have been cut from £260 to £55, including the return of the original stake. A customer placing a bet at 9.50pm received generous odds of 25/1 (left), but when it came to settling the bets, they paid out at just 9-2 (right) Sky Bet claims the better odds were offered by ‘mistake’ – and its actions are in keeping with their small print . Sky Bet claims the better odds were offered by ‘mistake’ – and its actions are in keeping with the small print in its terms and conditions. The longer odds were offered while Chelsea were leading 2-1 in extra time. But the French side equalised, despite being reduced to ten men, and won the two-legged clash on away goals. Punters who successfully bet on the result were told they would be paid less than they expected only after the match was over, with an email sent from the company blaming an ‘administration error’. David Luiz celebrates scoring PSG's first goal during the UEFA Champions League Round of 16, second leg . Emil Bolstad, 26, was expecting to win £150 plus his £6 stake back – but profited by only £27. He said: ‘It’s false advertising. I made the bet based on 25-1 odds, not 9-2. It was only when it came time to pay up that I noticed the odds had changed. ‘If they can do this because of an “error”, they can do it for all their odds. They could triple their odds and after people have bet say, “Oh no, it was a mistake” and not pay out.’ Labour MP Graham Jones called the move 'outrageous' Labour MP Graham Jones said: ‘This is outrageous. What would have happened if a rival firm had better odds but people chose Sky Bet because of the 25-1 odds? Customers would have lost out. You can’t change the price after the sale. ‘Sky Bet are clearly a rip-off company who are willing to take their customers to the cleaners and deceive them. This is typical of the gambling industry.’ Sky Bet’s managing director Richard Flint said the longer odds were ‘clearly’ wrong. He said: ‘Occasionally mistakes happen. In this case a wrong price was displayed for around three minutes, and a small number of customers bet at the incorrect odds. These odds were clearly wrong – we showed odds of 25-1 when the true odds and the odds displayed by all other bookmakers was 9-2. We settled at the correct odds.’ The terms and conditions for the Sky Bet app – which has been downloaded 700,000 times on to iPhones and iPads – reserve the right to ‘correct obvious errors and either settle bets at the correct odds or void bets’.","Sky Bet branded a 'rip-off' after failing to honour odds at a Chelsea match .

"The Astana cycling team have denied reports they have been stripped of their WorldTour licence by the Independent Licence Commission. Last month the UCI requested that Astana's licence be revoked by the commission following an independent audit into the team of 2014 Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali, which came after a number of anti-doping infringements by Astana and their feeder team. On Monday, Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported that Astana would lose their WorldTour licence and would only be allowed to apply for a Continental licence, the third tier of professional cycling, saying the decision had been made on March 20. The Astana cycling team have denied reports they have been stripped of their WorldTour licence . The Licence Commission is due to meet with Astana on Thursday, and the team said they believed that meeting would mark the start of the decision-making process, with no verdict yet in place. An Astana statement said: 'Astana Pro Team has every reason to believe that our meeting on April 2 with the Independent Licence Commission will be a properly conducted legal meeting with due process and is not a foregone conclusion. 'We aim to present evidence that Astana Pro Team is in full compliance with the ethical codes in place and is taking pro-active measures to enhance our role in the global fight against drugs in cycling.' When Astana were awarded their 2015 licence in December, conditions were attached after five riders linked to the team failed doping tests in 2014, including brothers Maxim and Valentin Iglinskiy, trainee Ilya Davidenok and two members of Astana's continental development team - Artur Fedosseyev and Victor Okishev. On Monday, Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported that Astana would lose their WorldTour licence . Astana was made to submit to an audit from the Institute of Sport Sciences of the University of Lausanne as a condition of its licence. At the conclusion of that audit, the UCI asked for Astana's licence to be revoked, saying the reality of the team's policies and structures differed markedly from what Astana told the licence commission during a review last December. Kazakhstan-based Astana previously said they would appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if their licence was revoked. There has been no suggestion of wrong-doing on the part of Tour winner Nibali. The UCI has not responded to requests for comment on Monday's report.","Astana cycling team have denied reports they have lost WorldTour licence .

"Somewhere in the slew of congratulatory messages aimed at Katarina Johnson-Thompson after winning her first major gold medal was one from Jessica Ennis-Hill, whose British pentathlon record she had just broken. The Olympic heptathlon champion had earlier posted pictures of herself looking in superb shape as she prepares to make a comeback after the birth of son, Reggie. ‘Sad to see my record go but couldn’t have gone to a more deserving athlete,’ she said. ‘I know how you feel,’ replied Johnson-Thompson, addressing Morgan Lake, who had just broken Johnson-Thompson’s own British junior record. There is more love than loathing in this emerging three-way rivalry but it could be just what athletics needs to capture the interest of the British public. Katarina Johnson-Thompson won European Indoor pentathlon gold in Prague on Friday . ‘I heard that the Davis Cup tennis on the BBC got switched off to go to the athletics to watch my world record attempt, which is insane,’ said Johnson-Thompson. ‘It’s great for the sport and if heptathlon can be the driving force to get people watching athletics then it will be nothing but positive. The rivalry will be good in the summer with the Olympic champion coming back and hopefully me and Morgan coming through. It’s great.’ All three will meet for the first time in a heptathlon at the Hypo meeting in Gotzis in Austria at the end of May. The youngster collapsed to the floor in celebration after finishing the 800 metres . Fellow British pentathlete Morgan Lake looks on despondently after crashing out at 1.95m . For Lake, who is just 17 but better than both her illustrious compatriots were at the same age, it will be another step on her ascent to the senior ranks. But if Johnson-Thompson continues her meteoric rise and Ennis-Hill can come close to recapturing the form which saw her win gold at London 2012, their battle could be one of the most gripping in sport this year. Johnson-Thompson clearly sets herself high standards. Crestfallen after missing out on the pentathlon world record by 13 points, she burst into tears of despair. Coach Mike Holmes, mother Tracey and a host of Great Britain teammates were on hand to remind her she had become only the second woman in history to break 5,000 points in the pentathlon. Great Britain's Jessica Ennis poses with her gold medal at the 2010 World Indoor Athletics Championships . Johnson-Thompson shows off her pentathlon gold at the European Athletic Indoor Championships . Laying in her bed on Friday night, her body exhausted after what she deemed the most gruelling day of her career but mind unable to shut down, she ran through the day’s events. Perhaps, she mused, if the organisers had been kinder with the competition schedule she might have been able to recover better in time for her assault on the 800 metres, the final event. Or maybe if she had someone to push her in the 60m hurdles, she could have gone that split-second quicker. But her ambition should not be confused with arrogance. Johnson-Thompson, 22, claimed she would be in awe of Ennis Hill when they next compete. It will be the first time they have met since the London Olympics when she finished 15th, aged 19. Much has changed but even though she is now the world’s No1 heptathlete, Johnson-Thompson remains respectful of the elder stateswoman. Johnson-Thompson  celebrates gold in the Pentathlon at the 2015 European Athletics Indoor Championships . ‘I’m in awe of any Olympic champion,’ she said. ‘She’s one of the people who inspired me to be a heptathlete and I’ve seen her do it from a young age. It’s strange that I’m now breaking her records but she’s the Olympic champion and she’s got the British record outdoors. There’s a big difference between the heptathlon and pentathlon. I don’t know what would make me consider me her equal. I don’t like all the talk about it.’ Johnson-Thompson has been wary of setting targets in the past but admitted a medal in Beijing and gold at the Rio Olympics in 2016 were on her radar. ‘I didn’t imagine three years ago that I would be in this situation,’ she said. ‘It has come quicker than I expected. I’ll try to win in Rio, but I will be in my prime for Tokyo in 2020.’ The only problem is that by then Lake may be snapping at her heels.","Katarina Johnson-Thompson scooped pentathlon gold in Prague .

"Second-tier French club Nimes will be relegated at the end of the season after its former president was found guilty of trying to fix matches. After interviewing about 50 officials, players and coaches, the French league disciplinary commission says Jean-Marc Conrad tried to fix four matches as his club fought off relegation last season. He was banned from football-related activities for seven years. Seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested last November. Nimes' former club president Jean-Marc Conrad was arrested for his involvement in match-fixing last year . The investigation followed a 1-1 draw against Caen last May that kept Nimes in the second division and saw Caen promoted to the top flight.

"Police have released chilling CCTV footage of a women walking alone just minutes before she was fatally stabbed to death while she was on the phone to her husband. Prabha Arun Kumar, a 41-year-old Indian national, was seriously injured by a sharp object on a public walkway between Argyle Street, Parramatta, and Amos Street, Westmead on Saturday night, just 300m from her home. Ambulance Paramedics treated the IT professional at the scene before transporting her to Westmead Hospital, where she died about 12.45am yesterday. Scroll down for video . Prabha Arun Kumar (pictured) a 41-year-old Indian national, was seriously injured by a sharp object on a public walkway between Argyle Street, Parramatta, and Amos Street, Westmead on Saturday night . Prabha was talking to her husband, G. Arun Kumar, who lives in India with their 10-year-old daughter, when a suspicious man appeared. Her husband then heard her screaming before the line went dead. He did not hear about his wife's death until he arrived in Sydney on Sunday morning. 'She was walking while talking to Arun on the phone when she said that a suspicious-looking man was following her,' her brother-in-law, Thrijesh Jayachandra, told The Hindu. 'The next moment, he heard her scream for help and then plead with the man not to harm [her] and take all her belongings if he wanted. Seconds later, he heard her scream and say she was stabbed.' Ambulance Paramedics treated the IT professional at the scene before transporting her to Westmead Hospital, where she died about 12.45am yesterday . It's believed Prabha got off a train at Parramatta Railway Station about 9pm, before walking along Argyle Street and turning left onto the walkway. Police believe she was attacked while on the walkway. She sustained a number of injuries, which police believe were inflicted by a sharp-edged weapon. A woman who was stabbed in a 'horrific' attack has been identified as Prabha Arun . Nearby resident Arvand Amirian told 9News he had found Ms Arun with blood all over her body after hearing 'crying screams' that 'didn't sound normal'. 'There was blood covering her face, her neck, her chest - her chest wasn't even moving so that's when I assumed she was gone,' Amirian said. Her  friend Sarada Angadimani, who Ms Arun was staying with, told 9News: 'Prabha was a really hard working, beautiful person. And, most importantly, a loving mother.' 'I hope God gives the family enough strength to endure this pain.' Prabha,  who moved to Sydney in 2012 for an off-site project with global technology firm Mindtree, was expected to return to India for a family reunion in April. 'She last called me three days ago, when she said it was taxing for her to stay away from family,' her aunt Bharathi Jayachandra said. She complained that work pressure was severe, and she planned to return home for good in April.' Prabha's elder brother, Shankar Shetty lives in Perth and identified her body on Saturday night. Prabha was talking to her husband, G. Arun Kumar, when a suspicious man appeared. Her husband then heard her screaming before the line went dead . It's believed Prabha got off a train at Parramatta Railway Station about 9pm, before walking along Argyle Street and turning left onto the walkway . Strike Force Marcoala has been formed to investigate the death. It compromises police from Parramatta Local Area Command and State Crime Command's Homicide Squad. Police are hoping that the images will jog the memory of anyone who was in the vicinity of Argyle Street, Park Parade or Amos Street that evening, and encourage them to come forward and speak with police. Superintendent Michael Willing has appealed to the public for help. 'We are really at a loss at this point in time as to who may be responsible,' he said. The 41-year-old was stabbed to death on this walkway in Parramatta . Flowers have been laid in the Sydney park where her body was found . The CCTV footage didn't appear to show anyone following the victim when she left the station about 9pm, he said. 'It's a horrific crime; (she) was killed in a very vicious way,' Supt Willing said. It's believed Mrs Kumar was stabbed in the neck on the path through Parramatta Park that cuts between a golf course and a high school. Results from a post-mortem examination should be ready on Monday afternoon or early on Tuesday and will hopefully give police a lead. Mindtree general manager Anoop George said her colleagues were devastated. Locals have left flowers and tributes on the path where she died. 'My prayers are with you and your family. Lots of love. Mary,' one tribute said. Prabha's elder brother, Shankar Shetty lives in Perth and identified her body on Saturday night . Locals from Sydney paid their respects at the scene today .

"Fast bowler Mohammad Amir came agonisingly close to a hat-trick in his return to domestic cricket on Friday after a ban of four-and-a-half years. Amir removed opening batsman Naved Malik and Ali Sarfraz off successive deliveries in his fourth over of a grade-two match, one level below first-class cricket. He still took three wickets in his first six-over spell at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, conceding 23 runs. However, his second spell was ineffective as the left-armer was smashed for 31 runs in three overs without success. Mohammad Amir (centre) took three wickets in on his comeback on Friday after his four-and-a-half year ban . 'I always try to make batsmen play as much as possible,' he said. 'I am trying to give 100 percent, but to be honest with you, it's not easy after all these years. It's like starting from zero.' Amir was banned from all cricket after pleading guilty in 2010 to charges of bowling deliberate no-balls at pre-arranged times to fix spot betting markets, while playing for Pakistan in a Test against England at Lord's. The International Cricket Council shortened his five-year ban in January, for his cooperation with its anti-corruption and security unit. The 22-year-old Amir made a delayed return when his match last Tuesday was washed out. He's playing for Omar Associates in the three-day Patron's Trophy. 'Four and a half years ago I was at my peak, and I can't get back those years,' Amir said. 'But as a Muslim, I believe there's always a lesson in life. I can't rewind those years but I should avail what time I have ahead of me.' Amir (left) almost took a hat-trick in his opening spell but did manage to take three wickets for 23 runs . He has at least two more three-day matches in the tournament, then plans to play in domestic T20 tournament next month. 'I delivered 90 percent of my deliveries where I wanted to. The inswingers which were there in 2009 are still coming up nicely,' he added with a broad smile. Amir has received a mixed response about his international future. Former Pakistan board chairman Tauqir Zia and ex-captain Ramiz Raja say he shouldn't represent Pakistan again because he's tainted. But Amir seems to be unruffled by the critics. He has set his sights on Pakistan's series against India in December. Amir (left) was banned from all cricket in 2010 for spot-fixing during Pakistan's Test vs England at Lord's . 'Who doesn't want to play against India?' Amir said. 'It's a dream of every Pakistani cricketer to play against India, and my aim is to give performances, stay fit, and get selected.' He was considered Pakistan's next great bowler, having taken 51 wickets in 14 tests at an average of 29.09, and 25 wickets in 15 one-day internationals at an average of 24. He also had 23 wickets in 18 Twenty20s. Sabih Azhar, the coach of Rawalpindi Rams, for whom Amir will play in the T20 tournament next month, supported Amir's return. 'He certainly deserves one more chance,' Azhar told The Associated Press after watching Amir from the boundary line at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. 'He's ready for international cricket, and his body language clearly tells you that he's hungry to do well for Pakistan.' Amir has set his sights on making an international return for Pakistan's series against India in December .","Mohammad Amir took three wickets in a grade-two match on Friday .

"A Spanish court says the former president and two other former board members of football club Osasuna were arrested on Friday as part of an investigation into financial irregularities that authorities think may be linked to match fixing. The regional court of northern Navarra says ex-president Patxi Izco, former vice president Juan Pascual and former director Diego Maquirriain were brought in to give testimony before judge Fermin Otamendi. Another former president and two other former board members were arrested Thursday and also gave evidence before Otamendi. Patxi Izco, ex-president of Spanish club Osasuna, appeared before a judge in connection with match fixing . Former president Juan Pascual also appeared to give a testimony in the regional court in Narvarra . The arrests came as Otamendi investigates the disappearance of at least 2.4million euros (£1.7m) from the club's coffers between November 2013 and June 2014. Current club director Pedro Baile Osasuna has acknowledged a government sports council audit last year uncovered an unaccounted-for payment made by the club.","The Spanish match-fixing scandal continues with a probe into Osasuna .

"A team official sparked a match-fixing row in Italy's Serie B after dropping his notes and leaving them on the team bench, where they were found by officials of the other club. Virtus Entella scrambled a 3-3 draw at Frosinone in Saturday's game after equalising with a controversial penalty in stoppage time. Frosinone president Maurizio Stirpe said his club had found a note on the Virtus bench on which the words 'we score with a penalty' had been scribbled, which was interpreted as a forecast of what was going to happen and raised suspicions of match manipulation. Frosinone (whose fans are pictured away at Pescara Calcio in November) claim they found a note on their opponent's bench on Saturday, with the words 'we score a penalty' on it . Frosinone (pictured) drew 3-3 with their opponents Virtus Entella on Saturday, who scored a late penalty . 'If the story is confirmed, would cast more shadows on the entire football system,' he told Italian media. However, Entella angrily denied the suggestion. 'It is not a prediction of the end of the game as feared by some media but rather just a report on the match,' team manager Maurizio Podesta told the club's website. Podesta said he always wrote a detailed report on the team's games, however, he ran out of space near the end and noted down the penalty on a second sheet of paper. 'On the final whistle, and during the celebration of our unexpected draw, I let the second sheet fall, presumably in the vicinity of the Entella team bench.' Despite Frosinone's claims, Virtus Entella have angrily denied the suggestion of match-fixing . Entella's statement added: 'It is with great sadness that we have to reconstruct the facts, which led fans and executives of Frosinone to create a climate of tension and suspicion towards the players, officials and supporters of Virtus Entella.' Last month, Lazio president Claudio Lotito, also a powerbroker in the Italian federation, caused uproar in Italy by naming several small clubs that he did not want to be promoted from Serie B in a leaked phone conversations. Lotito said that promotion of the clubs, which included Frosinone, would be a financial disaster for Serie A. Serie B was hit by a match-fixing scandal in 2010/11 which led to more than 50 players being banned and several clubs suffering points deductions. However, Italian football is also riddled with conspiracy theories, known as 'biscuits', which often turn out to have little or no foundation.

"Six Nations champions Ireland returned home to their native country as heroes after retaining the title in spectacular fashion in Scotland. The tournament went right down to the wire with England, Wales and the Irish all in with a chance of lifting the trophy. But it was the reigning champions who triumphed thanks to an emphatic 40-10 over the Scots - who lost every game in this year's competition. Rob Kearney (centre) holds the Six Nations trophy in front of a mixture of youthful and experienced fans . Jamie Heaslip (centre) poses for a photograph with a young fan after returning to Ireland . Joe Schmidt's side were on course for the Grand Slam after impressing in the opening three fixtures but defeat in Wales, opened up the Six Nations title race and made sure it came down to the final day. Two tries from Sean O'Brien, one for Paul O'Connoll and Jared Payne completed a comfortable victory for the Irish and it was left to England needing to score 26-points to claim the title. Unfortunately for Stuart Lancaster's side it was too much of an ask with a mixture of poor defending and individual errors playing their part in conceding sloppy tries. Winning by 20 points just wasn't enough and Ireland's players were left celebrating at the end of the final game before receiving the coveted Six Nations trophy. It was the first time Ireland retained the title since 1949 and upon their return you could see what it meant to the country with hundreds of people turning out to greet them.

"What an incredible day of rugby that was. I thought it might be exciting, I hoped it would be exciting but never did I think it would hit the levels it did. What a shame, then, that Scotland allowed themselves to get caught up in the story which unfolded rather than focus on their task at hand. In the second half at BT Murrayfield, Vern Cotter’s men lost the plot rather than doing the basics right and there did not seem to be anyone giving direction in the last 20 minutes. It is an inexperienced side and we saw that naivety in spades on Saturday. Scotland's dismal Six Nations campaign ended with a 40-10 thrashing by Ireland at Murrayfield . Scotland should not concede 40 points at home and lose by a margin of 30 points to Ireland. A championship that promised so much has, ultimately, delivered very little and Scotland’s dismal run in the Six Nations continues. In 12 matches, we have won only once and that was courtesy of a last-minute drop goal in Rome last season. That says it all really. It is particularly painful when placed against the style and substance displayed by the Irish, England, France and Wales on what was a stunning day. For the tournament to go down to the last second of the last game was amazing but it was what happened in the lead-up to those tense dying moments which made Saturday truly remarkable. Scotland's huge loss on Saturday was their fifth in the tournament and they finished bottom of the table . I thought Wales would rack up a load of points against Italy but they only did this in a devastating second-half display. As that game was drawing to a close, with Wales 28 points better off than Ireland and looking like scoring again, it appeared that it was game over and Wales would win the Six Nations. But they missed the chance and Italy scored down the other end. There was a collective cheer in Italy, Ireland and England because it gave the latter two countries a chance. I felt Wales were still favourites as, although I thought Ireland and England would win their games, I didn’t think they would be able to accumulate enough points to go above Wales. How wrong I was! I felt it was a perfect day for Scotland to really show what they were all about because there was no pressure on them whatsoever and they could just go out and play with total freedom. To a point, they did this but so did Ireland — and they did it far better than their hosts. Ireland were crowned Six Nations winners after a dramatic final day that saw them edge England and Wales . Both England and Ireland had targets they knew they had to win by to have a chance of lifting the Six Nations trophy. This very rarely happens in rugby and I thought this might mean their focus would be on scoring tries rather than playing the game in the normal safety-first manner. England did adopt this approach and it ultimately cost them but Ireland were able to operate a normal game plan, mainly because of how Scotland were playing. It was an exciting first half where Ireland dominated the early stages but Scotland hung in and eventually played some really good rugby that led to Finn Russell’s try. That was just about it for Scotland and the last 40 minutes of the Championship was painful — with so many mistakes, turnovers, penalties conceded and poor leadership. England beat France 55-35 at Twickenham but it wasn't enough to overhaul Ireland . Wales had earlier moved into pole position when they beat Italy 61-20 in Rome . With that thumping victory, Ireland set England a target of 26 points that they had to win by to snatch the trophy. The difference in this game was that France really did come to the party and easily produced their best performance of the Six Nations. Mind you, so did England — and 90 points scored tells you that the attack was very much on top with defence an optional extra at times. That England came within a metre and six points of winning the Six Nations was incredible and the drama was off the scale. When France won a penalty after 80 minutes had passed, the whole of Ireland celebrated but the drama was not over. Inexplicably, France ran the penalty on their own line and gave England one more chance to win the ball back and caused a nation to have a collective heart attack. Eventually they saw sense and kicked the ball out to finish off the most amazing day in the history of the RBS Six Nations. When the dust settled, Ireland were crowned Six Nations champions but huge credit goes to England, Wales and France for their contribution to an incredible day. As for Scotland and Italy, they contributed as well but in a very different way.","Scotland finished bottom of the standings in the Six Nations .

"Scotland rugby fans are not, as a rule, the kind of folk who fling Mars bars at directors’ boxes or strike up furious chants demanding a change of leadership. It takes something hugely infuriating to prompt them out of their beery reverie and happily soused sense of match-day bonhomie, a state of mind where every stranger is regarded as just a friend they haven’t met, and where the pain of loss is tempered by the knowledge that their new best pals are enjoying victory. The actions of one poor demented soul at Murrayfield on Saturday evening offered a brief and revelatory glimpse, then, of how deeply the national mood has darkened at the end of an emotionally exhausting Six Nations Championship, a campaign that moved from promising to properly poor without bothering to shift through the gears. Scotland's dismal Six Nations campaign ended with a 40-10 thrashing by Ireland at Murrayfield . Scotland's huge loss on Saturday was their fifth in the tournament and they finished bottom of the table . Scotland's Finn Russell is tackled by Conor Murray and Rory Best during their Six Nations rugby match . Storming up the steps at the back of the main stand with about five minutes to go, Angry from Maryculter whistled sharply for the attention of Vern Cotter and his coaching team, safely ensconced behind reinforced glass in their secure box. Satisfied that he had caught their eye, the furious fan — a sensible enough looking chap — pointed and roared about the ‘disgrace’ and ‘joke’ of a performance he had been watching all afternoon. Give that man a hand. Or a blog on the BBC website, at least. None of the home fans among the 67,000 sell-out enjoyed seeing their team reduced to mere fodder — an absolute irrelevance — by an Ireland side involved in a run chase, a mathematical exercise in points accumulation. Considering the paucity of the Scotland performance, devoid of spark and littered with the kind of basic errors that would move a mini-rugby coach to break down in tears, the sound of patience snapping all over the stadium could hardly have come as a surprise to anyone. Still, at least the Irish had a right good day out, with head coach Joe Schmidt making a point of mentioning how welcoming the home crowd had been to his boys. Fortress Murrayfield, eh? Available for conferences, weddings, bar mitzvahs and even title celebrations — complete with fireworks — by anyone but the regular residents.

Ireland players celebrate at the end of the match at Murrayfield before being crowned Six Nations champions . Ireland's O'Brien and Devin Toner escape Scotland's Gray during the Six Nations match at Murrayfield . If everyone involved in the Scotland set-up, from the kit man to self-styled comedy guru and full-time director of rugby Scott Johnson, didn’t feel at least a little uncomfortable watching the Irish party on Saturday night, something is very wrong. Our home ground certainly lacks the intimidation factor that comes with a winning team, the best we can offer being a Billy Connolly lookalike wandering on to the field with a claymore and a monkey, with a microphone, yelling at people to support the team — or even giggling to himself as he makes his one joke about Geoff Cross’ beard again and again and again. Given the situation, Ireland — ranked third in the world and chasing a second successive Six Nations title — were never going to flinch from the task in hand. They ran in four tries, forced Scotland to concede a dirty dozen penalties, won every contest that mattered … and genuinely seemed capable of taking the ball back from Scotland any time they damn well pleased. The visitors won a dozen turnovers and, if some of those were the result of excellent work in the breakdown, most were about the Scots simply dropping the ball, knocking it on, losing it when hanging on might, just might, have given them a chance of avoiding a 30-point demolition. Sure, Finn Russell scored a nice enough try for the home team, finishing with a bit of cheek for good measure. But dear oh dear, the majority of the fare served up was miserably thin. Vern Cotter (centre) has his position as Scotland head coach under scrutiny after a winless Six Nations . Russell (right) touches down for a Scotland try in the defeat against Ireland on Saturday . Scotland were outclassed by Ireland at Murrayfield as the visitors secured the Six Nations title . Take the passage of play leading up to Ireland’s third try as perhaps the ideal snapshot of the entire afternoon. It all started with a brilliant Tommy Seymour take on a high ball plummeting to earth inside the Irish half, the Scotland winger collecting and driving forward. When Greig Laidlaw’s low pass in front of Jonny Gray was knocked on by the stooping big man, though, it handed Ireland a scrum on halfway. A scrum that they converted into a penalty by simply pulverising the Scottish eight. A kick to touch, a line-out cleanly taken, an efficient working of the ball through the phases — and bang, Jared Payne scores under the posts. Absolutely maddening. Errors like that, of which there were far too many to document on Saturday, have left Cotter banging on about the same problems that confronted him on day one of his reign. He still talks with some degree of animation, by his standards, about possession, grabbing hold of teams and shaking them until they hurt, treating every second in every game as a moment of truth. Already he is looking forward to a long training camp ahead of the World Cup, promising that working and drilling them, going back to basics and forcing them to confront their own shortcomings will bear dividends. Improvement should be possible. Important players, leaders, will return from injury. We will duly skelp Japan and beat the USA in our opening two World Cup games, raising hopes just in time for the crucial group fixtures against South Africa and Samoa. If that is the limit of our ambitions, grand. If we are content to be bumping along the bottom of the Six Nations table, occasionally rousing ourselves for the odd Autumn test against undercooked southern hemisphere opposition, carry on. Cotter obviously hopes to achieve more than that in his time as Scotland head coach. But he can’t do it alone. Given the lack of strength in depth, even his most promising players must, absolutely must, take personal responsibility for carrying themselves and their team-mates to at least the middle ground of international respectability. Russell, celebrating his very first professional try a year into his career, said: ‘Vern keeps talking about detail. We need to improve as individuals, as well as improving as a team. Russell backed coach Cotter to inspire Scotland to turn their form around with the World Cup coming . Conor Murray (second right) makes a break for Ireland during the Six Nations game against Scotland . Jonny Gray (centre) of Scotland wins a line out ball during the Six Nations match against Ireland . ‘It’s up to individual players to go away to their clubs and work on these things. Then we should come back for pre-season, hopefully, with all the players tweaking things and returning as better rugby players. ‘Because we do know that we need to step up again for the World Cup. Personally, as a playmaker, I have to take a lot out of this campaign and look at what I can do better. It will come. We will go to the World Cup as a better team.’ As promises go, it’s not quite up there with a dazed David Denton seemingly suggesting that Scotland might contend for the Webb Ellis Trophy half a year down the line. Right now, we would settle for performances that keep the fans at bar’s length from open revolt — and the Mars bars tucked firmly in place between the hip flask and the tartan tammy.","Scotland were thrashed 40-10 by Six Nations winners Ireland on Saturday .

"Gary Cahill wants to prove a point to his critics after coming under fire for some poor performances at the heart of Chelsea's defence. England centre back Cahill was widely praised for his water-tight partnership with John Terry last season, and in the early stages of the current campaign, but his ability has been called into question with a few poor performances of late. Cahill was poor for Chelsea in the New Year's Day 5-3 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane and he allowed Raheem Sterling to run unchecked for Liverpool's goal in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg at Anfield.

But now the 29-year-old wants to use his time back in the first team to help Chelsea to glory in the Barclays Premier League and Champions League. 'It's that fire in your belly,' he said. 'Although you'd wish not to have it, dealing with criticism is probably what has got me to where I am today. This is no different. I will come out the other end without a shadow like you see today.'

"A mother has revealed her horror after she discovered she married a paedophile. Mel Alford, of Exeter, Devon, said she only found out her husband Jonathan's past when he appeared in court to admit grooming an underage girl for sex. The 37-year-old, who has three children, first met the man she knows as JR, in April 2012 through Facebook as she was friends with his older brother. Mel Alford said she had no idea her husband Jonathan was a paedophile until he was in court . Ms Alford said she agreed to go on a date with him after he ‘kept sending nice messages’. She revealed: ‘We ended up getting engaged in August and brought the wedding forward to November that year when I found out my dad was dying from cancer. 'We were together most of the time and the start of our marriage was really good. He was great with my kids and treated me like a queen. 'I had no idea what he was really like until a social worker visited me and told me he was on bail for sleeping with an underage girl. 'That girl had come to my children's dad's house and told him and he contacted social services.' Ms Alford said that her husband denied it and pulled up what he told her was the girl's Facebook page which had a message to him saying 'sorry I lied’. Mel - pictured with Jonathan on their wedding day - said he treated her 'like a queen' She said: 'It turns out he had set up a fake account to send that message. 'Myself and the kids believed him so we just carried on. But he became so jealous after we got married and I could not answer the door in case it was a man and he would sleep outside in his car if we had a row. 'In September 2013 I kicked him out. But I didn't know the allegations were true until I saw he was in court.’ At Exeter Crown Court, Jonathan Alford admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child, seven of making or possessing indecent images of children, three of having extreme pornography and one of perverting the course of justice. Alford was also caught with child abuse and bestiality images on his computer and was jailed for seven years and three months in July last year. Ms Alford said she was totally unaware of his charges until he appeared in court and said struggled to believe that the man she loved and brought into her family was capable of such crimes. Jonathan Alford was jailed for more than seven years after he admitted admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child and other related offences . 'I went along to the court and shouted and screamed on every plea. I heard all about his sickening crimes,’ Ms Alford said. 'It was so disturbing I don't think it was really sinking in on the day. 'I walked into the middle of the court and called him a “dirty bastard”. He smiled at me and I just wanted to kill him. 'He had been brought into my family and been around my kids. I was sickened. Still all I know is what I heard in court that day. I still don't really know the full story. 'I never saw him again after that. I wanted to go to his sentencing hearing but because I had kicked off at the previous hearing the police wouldn't let me in. 'I have asked my kids if he ever tried it on with them and they have said no. But he should not have been allowed anywhere near me and my three children while he was on bail. 'There should have been checks done.' Ms Alford said she is now awaiting her final divorce papers to come through, and has set up an unofficial website to ‘name and shame’ offenders – which the police have told her to take down. She said: 'It has certainly made me a lot more cautious about people and I am passionate about what I am doing. 'I am proud to have met so many people and victims. I am not a counsellor but they tell me their story and I try and help them.’ She added: 'You have no idea who is a paedophile. I was married to one and did not know. 'I hear so many stories - many of them extremely heart-breaking. I just want people to be more aware of who they are dating and allowing to be around their children.’ She said: 'I carry a lot of guilt that I put my children in danger by having this man around them. I don't think I will ever get over that.’","Mel Alford, 37, married Jonathan  in 2012 after meeting on Facebook .

The hosts started stronger, and it was no surprise when Mohamed Salah fashioned the chance for the opening goal after 17 minutes. Salah has been a revelation since arriving in Serie A on loan from Chelsea, with six goals in seven appearances, and he continued his good run of form by playing Ilicic in for the opener. With Fiorentina on the counter-attack, Salah picked up the ball on the left flank - slightly unfamiliar for him - and drove forward at pace. No challenges came in and the Egyptian had the simple task of slipping the ball between two defenders to the feet of Ilicic, who took a touch to compose himself before smashing a left-footed drive past Lukasz Skorupski at his near post. Roma came more into it as the half went on and missed good opportunities through Juan Manuel Iturbe and Alessandro Florenzi but they did also lose both captain Daniel de Rossi and Kostas Manolas to injury. Radja Nainggolan also picked up a booking meaning he will miss the second leg in the Italian capital. After the break the two sides edged back into their shells a little in fear of giving away more of an advantage, but the game burst back into life on the hour mark.

Ilicic (hidden) is mobbed by his team-mates after opening the scoring at the Artemio Franchi stadium . Iturbe broke clear down the right and, one-on-one with Neto, tried to dodge past the Fiorentina keeper but was brought down. The protests were fierce as the Brazilian clearly got a hand to the ball but referee Antonio Mateh Lahoz refused to waver. Ljalic stepped up and hit the penalty hard and low but Neto dived low to his right to palm it away. Brazilian goalkeeper Neto brought down Juan Manuel Iturbe to give away a penalty on the hour mark . But Neto swept himself down, got back between the sticks and brilliantly saved Adem Ljalic's penalty . But Roma were not to be denied for too long. Just 17 minutes later Keita found space to nod in Florenzi's corner and grab the crucial away goal. Fiorentina could have restored a lead moments later but Milan Badelj was brilliantly stopped by Skorupski. But it was not enough, Roma take a slender lead back to the Stadio Olimpico next Thursday. Keita crashed in an equaliser with his head to give Roma the first-leg advantage on Thursday . Keita found himself in acres of space to level the scores and put Roma in the driving seat of the tie .

"A Palestinian refugee achieved his lifetime ambition to one day own a lion when he adopted two of them and brought them into his home. Saad al-Jamal purchased the two-month-old lion cubs from the cash-strapped Rafah zoo. He has plans to raise them at his house in the Al-Shabora refugee camp in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, although he faces a difficult task as the lions - and their appetites - grow. Saad al-Jamal holds the lions in his arms as one of them struggles in an effort to get back on the ground . Mr al-Jamal plans to raise the cubs at his house in the Al-Shabora refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip . He refused to say how much he paid for the cubs, but admitted to AFP that he has received a $9,000 offer (£6,000) to buy them. The two lion cubs, one male and one female, have been named Alex and Mona. They have been living in the three-bedroom flat ‘like members of the family’ for 10 weeks, and they play 'all day long' with Mr al-Jamal's children and grandchildren. Footage shows the cubs play-fighting on the floor of the family's flat, and interacting with young children. The lion cubs can be seen on the video interacting with Mr al-Jamal’s children and grandchildren . Bringing the cubs outside, Mr al-Jamal holds the lions in his arms and as of them fights against him to be put back down. Other clips show the owner is featured stroking them as they bask in the sun. It is believed that the parents of the cubs were brought into Gaza via a tunnel along the border with Egypt around three years ago. Raising two lion cubs is a costly venture, and Mr al-Jamal has plans to use them to earn money. He intends to lease them to parks, restaurants and seaside resorts once they are a few months older. Saad Al-Jamal purchased the two-month-old lion cubs called Alex and Mona from the Rafah zoo . Once the cubs are 15-months-old they will develop adult teeth and possess the ability to tear flesh . At just two months, the cubs eat half a kilogram of meat a day, and their appetites will become even larger as they get older. Right now the animals are at an age where they are unable to inflict any real damage. But once the cubs reach 15-months-old they will develop adult teeth and will possess the ability to tear flesh. At which point, Mr al-Jamal’s living situation might not be so harmonious.","Saad al-Jamal purchased the two-month-old lion cubs from the Rafah zoo .

"His lack of goalscoring early on in his Barcelona career might have drawn some critics, but Luis Suarez is the best signing of the season in terms of chance creation - ahead even of Barclays Premier League assists king Cesc Fabregas. CIES Football Observatory have compiled the top 12 signings of the season in the top five European leagues for rigour, take-ons, recovery, chance creation, distribution and shooting - using statistics to analyse and narrow them down. And £75million summer buy Suarez comes out on top in the 'chance creation' category ahead of two of the Premier League's finest, Fabregas and Swansea City's Gylfi Sigurdsson. Luis Suarez has been the best signing in terms of chance creation this season, say CIES Football Observatory . Cesc Fabregas is in second place on the 'chance creation' indicator despite his 15 league this season . Here are how the CIES Football Observatory Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) work: . Chance creation: ability to put team-mates in a good position to score. Shooting: ability to take advantage of goal opportunities through accurate shooting. Take on: ability to create dangerous situations by successfully challenging opponents. Distribution: ability to keep a hold on the game through efficient passing. Recovery: ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through proficient interception work. Rigour: ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through robust duelling. Suarez seems to finally be finding his feet at the Nou Camp, and he scored twice in the 2-1 win at Manchester City in the first leg of Barca's Champions League last-16 tie - but it's his work in support of team-mates which has really impressed his manager and supporters since his summer arrival. He has scored just 10 times in all competitions in 24 games, but there is no crisis because of a love for the new Suarez – the one who makes their all-star front three of him, Lionel Messi and Neymar tick. That new-found selflessness puts him ahead of Fabregas in terms of chance creation - despite the Chelsea star's 15 assists in the Premier League this season. That has obviously come at a sacrifice though, and Suarez hasn't been able to get close to the No 1 signing in the shooting category: Chelsea's Diego Costa. 1. Luis Suarez . 2. Cesc Fabregas . 3. Gylfi Sigurdsson . 4. James Rodriguez . 5. Toni Kroos . Barcelona . Chelsea . Swansea . Real Madrid . Real Madrid . 1. Diego Costa . 2. Antoine Griezmann . 3. Khouma Babacar . 4. Luciano Vietto . 5. Felipe Caicedo . Chelsea . Atletico Madrid . Fiorentina . Villarreal . Eibar . Suarez has moved from a goalscorer role to that of a provider since moving to Barcelona in the summer . Diego Costa (left) and Fabregas (right) have formed a deadly combination for Chelsea since signing . Costa is tops the rankings for 'shooting' as shown here by his fierce effort leading to a goal against Tottenham . An impressive 17 league goals put Costa top ahead of Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann . Top scorer in the Premier League with 17 league goals, and having played a key part in the Blues' Capital One Cup triumph against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, nobody would contest that £32m Costa has settled perfectly into the Stamford Bridge set-up. Behind him is Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann who looked to have been signed primarily as the creative force to feed another signing, Mario Mandzukic, but instead has been showing his own goalscoring prowess in a more advanced role. Some more surprising names in that list come from Fiorentina, Villarreal and Eibar in the form of Khouma Babacar, Luciano Vietto and Felipe Caicedo respectively - with West Ham's bargain buy Diafra Sakho coming in just outside the top five in seventh. Alexis Sanchez, despite his recent drought, is 12th. 1. Karim Bellarabi . 2. Angel di Maria . 3. Alexis Sanchez . 4. Diego Perotti . 5. Sadio Mane . Bayer Leverkusen . Manchester United . Arsenal .

Karim Bellarabi (left) is top for 'take on' as he showed by going past Atletico's Guilherme Siqueira last week . Angel di Maria (left) has struggled to keep up his  standards at Manchester United but does well for 'take ons' Xabi Alonso might have been surplus to requirements at Real Madrid but his distribution is valued at Bayern . Fabregas' passing ability has helped to bring Chelsea to the level of potential league champions this season . Another surprise name doing well in the distribution group is former Cardiff City flop Gary Medel (left) Jose Mourinho's summer business has been widely lauded and it is perhaps telling that Fabregas is also second in the 'distribution' indicator, with none of Chelsea's former players who moved on making it into the top 12 of any of the categories. Fabregas is only ousted in the list focused on efficient passing by Bayern Munich's Xabi Alonso, who is top ahead of his replacement at Real Madrid, Toni Kroos, in third. Inter Milan's Gary Medel, who signed from relegation Cardiff City in the summer is fourth with Ivan Rakitic fifth. Players from the Premier League dominate the 'take on' group, with Angel di Maria (second), Sanchez (third) and Sadio Mane (fifth) - although all fall in the wake of Bayer Leverkusen trickster, and reported Manchester United target, Karim Bellarabi. 1.

Dejan Lovren (left) surprisingly tops the 'rigour' category despite a difficult first season with Liverpool . Burnley's Michael Keane (left) is another surprise name on that list after moving from Manchester United . While there are some surprise names on the lists, perhaps the biggest is Liverpool's £20m centre back Dejan Lovren, who somehow finishes top of the 'rigour' category for 'ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through robust duelling'. Lovren, widely regarded as a transfer flop, finishes ahead of Roma's Davide Astori - who also scored highly in the 'recovery' category - and Burnley's Michael Keane. And Rafael Benitez seems to have done good business in signing Walter Gargano for Napoli. He tops the 'recovery' category with only one English-based player in the top 12, Manchester United's Daley Blind - in 12th place. Manchester United's Daley Blind is the only top 12 player in terms of 'recovery' from the Premier League .","Stats from CIES Football Observatory reveal this season's top signings .

"January signing Krystian Bielik made his first start in Arsenal colours on Tuesday night, but the teenage prodigy could do nothing to stop Derby County beating the Gunners at the iPro Stadium. Bielik has been told that he will not play for Arsenal's first team this season as Arsene Wenger looks to bed the 17-year-old into the squad slowly, but he has been used by the youth sides, although not as an Under 21 starter until Tuesday. The Poland midfielder put in quiet but tidy performance before Derby's Ivan Calero smashed in a corner to steal the show and all three points in the Barclays Under 21 Premier League. Krystian Bielik breaks away from Alban Bunjaku of Derby County on his Arsenal youth team full debut . Bielik signed for Arsenal for £2million in January but has been told he is not yet ready for the first team . Bielik, signed from Legia Warsaw in January for £2million, even saw a header cleared off the line in the closing stages of the game but a dream youth team debut wasn't to be. The defeat for Arsenal meant Derby leapfrog them in the U21 Premier League on goal difference, although the Gunners have three games in hand. Derby were on top from the start and went close through Shaquille McDonald, Daniel Crowley and Callum Guy before Jamie Hanson curled two free-kicks against the crossbar.

Daniel Crowley tries to escape the attentions of Bunjaku, but Arsenal lost and were leapfrogged by Derby .

"UEFA have announced ticket details for the Champions League final in Berlin - with each finalist receiving just a 20,000 allocation and prices ranging between £50 and £280. The show-piece final of Europe's premier competition takes place later than usual this year, with 16 clubs still fighting it out for a place in Berlin on June 6. Tickets for the general public via UEFA's ballot go on sale on Thursday at 11am UK time, with 6,000 available to fans worldwide. This season's Champions League final is on June 6 at the 70,500-capacity Olympic Stadium in Berlin . Tickets for the show-piece event at the Olympic Stadium will cost between £50 and £280 . Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal will all hope to be playing in the vast arena come June 6 . Each club competing in the final will be allocated 20,000 tickets. That would be bad news for season-ticket holders from Chelsea (24,000), Manchester City (36,000) and Arsenal (45,000), of whom a significant number would miss out. The ticket prices, split across four categories, represent a price-freeze compared to last year's final won by Real Madrid against local rivals Atletico Madrid in Lisbon. But supporters of any English club with their eyes on Berlin's Olympic Stadium in June could be disappointed with their allocation as Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal all have more season-ticket holders than that figure would accommodate. However, the 20,000 figure is more than Chelsea were given for their two most recent European finals in Munich (17,500) for the Champion League and Amsterdam (9,800) in the Europa League. Arsenal and Chelsea received allocations of 21,000 for their previous finals in Paris and Moscow respectively.

Season ticket holders from Manchester City (left), Arsenal (centre) and Chelsea (right) could miss out . While City and Arsenal face an uphill task to even reach the quarter-final stage after home first-leg defeats to Barcelona and Monaco respectively, Chelsea will hope their 1-1 draw away at PSG will be enough to help them through in the return leg at Stamford Bridge next Wednesday.

"West Ham striker Carlton Cole has been fined £20,000 after he admitted breaching FA rules in relation to social media with an offensive tweet. Cole was involved in a Twitter spat with a Tottenham Hotspur fan after West Ham's 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw at White Hart Lane on February 22 and replied to an insult with a tweet saying 'F off you c***'. He later deleted the message. The 31-year-old, who has 122,000 followers on the social networking site, was responding to a message from Spurs supporter Stuart Hardy that read: 'Hi @CarltonCole1 when your own team-mates don't kick the ball out when you're lying injured for 2 mins, you think it's time to call it a day?' West Ham striker Carlton Cole has been fined £20,000 for tweeting a fan saying 'F off you c***' last month . Cole tweeted back to a Tottenham fan who had insulted him on Twitter, telling the  supporter: 'F off you c***' Carlton Cole is far from the first footballer to have be censured over his behaviour on Twitter: . Darren Bent, 2009 - £120,000 fine . Bent was fined by his club Tottenham for a blast at chairman Daniel Levy. He tweeted: ‘Do I wanna go Hull City NO. Do I wanna go Stoke NO do I wanna go Sunderland YES so stop f****** around levy.’ Carlton Cole, 2011 - £20,000 fine . Cole tweeted during England's friendly with Ghana saying: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap!' Rio Ferdinand, 2012 - £45,000 fine . Ferdinand appeared to endorse a tweet by another user  which described  Ashley Cole as a 'choc ice', a term said to mean a person is black on the outside but white on the inside. Ashley Cole, 2012 - £90,000 fine . Cole was unimpressed with the FA's judgement in the John Terry racism case, tweeting: 'Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFT***S' Michael Chopra, 2014 - £15,000 fine . Referring to life at crisis club Blackpool, Chopra posted: ‘F****** joke this come in training only 6 f****** players here then find out the fitness coach taken the football session #joke.’ Rio Ferdinand, 2014 - three match ban and £25,000 fine . QPR defender used the word 'sket' in reference to another Twitter user's mother this season. Cole, who has over 100,000 Twitter followers, was also 'severely warned' as to his future conduct by the FA. An FA statement said: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today, Carlton Cole has been fined £20,000 after he admitted breaching FA Rules in relation to social media.' 'The West Ham United player, who was also severely warned as to his future conduct, admitted posting a comment on his Twitter account which was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, in breach of FA Rule E3.' The former Chelsea striker has been in trouble before for previous postings on social media and that may be taken into account in his punishment. He was fined £20,000 by the FA in April 2011 for a tweet he posted during England's friendly against Ghana that read: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap! 'The only way to get out safely is to wear an England jersey and paint your face w/ the St George's flag!' Cole, who is currently recovering from a hamstring injury that forced him off during the game at Tottenham, will look at Rio Ferdinand as an example of how to avoid future misdeameanours. The QPR defender was handed a three-game ban earlier this season for a second FA charge over social media activities - with the former England captain not contesting the suspension despite labelling the severity of the decision as 'crazy'.

"Roy Keane is back at Old Trafford as a pundit for BBC Sport ahead of Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final between Manchester United and Arsenal. The former United captain joined presenter Gary Lineker, former adversary Alan Shearer and Ian Wright in the Old Trafford studio to provide his views on the quarter-final clash. Keane, who has never been afraid to air his views either in his TV work or in his two autobiographies, was working with the BBC for the first time having previously worked for ITV. Roy Keane (left), Alan Shearer (centre) and Ian Wright (right) were working for the BBC as pundits on Monday . Gary Lineker addresses the punditry trio during some of their heated pre-match discussion at Old Trafford . Keane was famously red carded for lashing out at Shearer with a punch at St James' Park in 2001 - but the pair seemed happy enough to sit next to each other in the studio on Monday. He also joked that he hated Wright, who played for Arsenal while the pair were both players and there were moments that their debate became heated at Old Trafford. In Keane's book The Second Half, he includes Shearer, on a list with Alf-Inge Haaland, Rob Lee, David Batty and Patrick Vieira in as players 'at the back of my mind'. Keane made it clear that although he regularly came across Alan Shearer while working as a TV pundit, there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other. Wright talked briefly about the rivalry and hatred between Arsenal and Manchester United . Shearer rows with Keane during their playing careers back in 2001 - and they were back together for TV . Last year, Wright claimed in a video on his YouTube channel that Keane was the best TV pundit around at the moment. 'Roy Keane is the best,' the former Arsenal striker said. 'He's got credibility and he's another one who doesn't care what anyone thinks. What he says is most probably right but it's brutally honest and some people don't like that.'

"Premier League 'B' teams could be allowed to play in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy under new plans  discussed at a meeting of Football League clubs. Walsall are set to play Bristol City in the final of this year's tournament on March 22, but in future second-string sides from the Premier League would be allowed to compete with the 48 League One and Two teams if plans are finalised. Football League clubs authorised the Football League's executive to push forward with the plans last month, although a formal proposal is yet to be passed. The Johnstone's Paint Trophy could involve Premier League 'B' teams in future if plans get the go-ahead . Youth squads from the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea could soon be headed for the lower-tier cup . If the Football League do bring 'B' teams into the Johnstone's Paint Trophy, they could adopt a similar format to that suggested by Greg Dyke last year, meaning teams would: . And in a meeting of AFC Wimbledon's Supporters' Trust, The Dons Trust, it was revealed that only one League Two club voted against the idea - Wimbledon themselves. FA Chairman Greg Dyke proposed the idea of bringing 'B' teams into the league pyramid itself in June last year but was told that Football League clubs had 'no appetite' for such a move. However it now seems that they are more keen on introducing the development squads into the JPT in a move that could one day see youth sides from the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea facing each other in a Wembley Stadium show-piece final. A statement from the Football League clarifying the situation read: 'Clubs have been asked to consider the concept of permitting 16 U21 teams from clubs with category one academies to participate in The Football League Trophy. 'The competition would feature 16 groups of four teams with one U21 team in each group, before a knockout stage leading to a final at Wembley Stadium. 'Given the previous concerns of the League and its clubs about Premier League B teams playing in the pyramid, any final proposal would also be accompanied by a change to the League's Articles of Association that would protect the current 72 club constitution, save for any changes to promotion/relegation that clubs wished to make. Peterborough manager Darren Ferguson holds the trophy last year - but a youth coach win it in future . 'Therefore, having provided them with this comfort, clubs willingly debated the potential commercial, financial and player development benefits of having U21 teams in this competition from 2015/16. 'No formal proposals were tabled and no formal vote taken. 'Instead, League One and Two clubs were asked to indicate whether they were content to see The Football League progress the matter, which would include discussions with the Premier League and Football Association, so that clubs can consider a full proposal at a future point.'

"Radamel Falcao's miserable time at Manchester United plumbed new depths when he turned out for the club's Under 21s in their 1-1 draw with Tottenham. At a virtually empty Old Trafford the £280,00-a-week misfit endured a lifeless 72 minutes before suffering the ignominy of hearing cheers when his number was held up. United handed Monaco a £6m loan fee for Falcao, 29, and have an option to buy him for £43.2m at the end of the season. Catch up on all the action with Sportsmail's Oliver Todd. Host commentator . It could have been a win for Manchester United on Tuesday night, had Falcao not found his way in front of two goalbound shots. The expensive loanee did more harm than good to United's attack. One big positive for the home side though was Rafael. His all-round performance and excellent goal will surely give Louis van Gaal food for thought with regards to the left back slot. Anyway, that's it from our live coverage. Check out Mike Keegan's match report HERE. Thanks for following! That's it, the referee has blown the final whistle and United and Spurs play out a 1-1 draw. Kenny McEvoy scored the opener for Tottenham before Rafael equalised with a brilliant chip in the second half. But despite an attack boasting Radamel Falcao and James Wilson, United couldn't find a winner and Spurs had the best chance of the second half when they hit the bar. Liam Grimshaw heads Pereira's first corner wide via a deflection - a second comes in but it only ends with captain Tom Thorpe fouling the goalkeeper. There will be three minutes of time added on. Andy Kellet's brilliant back-heel sets up Pereira for a cross. His pin-point ball comes to the feet of Harrop but he hesitates in a way that resembled the man he replaced, Falcao. When he finally got the shot off, the effort was blocked and the chance was gone. Still both teams going in search of a winner. Meanwhile, Spurs make a sub. Lesniak is off for Aaron McEneff. Axel Tuanzebe is on as United search for a winner. Off comes Shaquile Coulthirst to be replaced by Daniel Akindiyini. United arguably look better with Falcao off the pitch and James Wilson trusted with a more central role. Rafael's cross from the right just evades the young striker sliding on and shortly after Pereira puts another Rafael delivery over the bar. Falcao is being subbed off! He's been poor in truth and has done more harm than good to United's attacks. Louis van Gaal is unlikely to be impressed and you would think he has no chance of starting at the weekend on this showing. He is replaced by Josh Harrop. Oh, and he awkwardly didn't seem to realise it was him that was being hooked at first, just as he did with the first team against Preston North End. It's fair to say the Old Trafford crowd weren't too impressed with him either: . Valdes comes out to scoop up the ball under the feet Shaquile Coulthirst but the Spurs make takes exception to his efforts and they have a bit of a shove at each other. Nothing special too and they're both just warned by the referee. Reece James comes off and surprise January signing on loan from Bolton, Andy Kellet, joins the action. Brilliant work from Rafael down the right flank for United and he finds himself in acres of space and with loads of time to pick a pass to the onrushing Goss at the edge of the area. He hits a low shot and it lands at the feet of Falcao but he can only find a slight deflection and it's easily saved. Again, it looked originally goalbound. McEvoy again provides from the left, this time his cross goes all the way to the edge of the area and Will Miller, who pokes a shot towards goal but it's easily saved by Valdes. A free-kick routine ends with McEvoy playing a short cross to Cameron Carter-Vickers at the near post and his glanced header hits the bar with Valdes nowhere near it. Best chance of the half so far goes to Spurs. Not too much happening here but Rafael is again looking the star of the show for United. Don't think we've seen Falcao touch the ball yet in the second period since he kicked us off. Meanwhile, Christian Fuchs has just put Schalke ahead against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the Champions League. It's 1-0 but that leaves Real still 2-1 ahead of aggregate. Keep up to date with our coverage HERE. The Spurs forward makes a darting run forward through midfield with a couple of feints thrown in for good measure, but he's eventually tackled on the edge of the D. Into the second half at Old Trafford. Falcao kicks the second period off from the centre spot. That's it for the first half. Rafael equalised for United with an excellent chip after Kenny McEvoy opened the scoring for Spurs. It's not been great from star man Radamel Falcao so far but he's putting himself about and you feel a better chance will come if he's not hooked at the break. Coming up to half him and Andreas Pereira is the latest United player to have a pop from range. This time it's from 25 yards and it goes a few inches over McGee's head. He had the keeper worried. One minute of added time is shown at Old Trafford. A poor - and unnecessary - challenge sees the United youngster booked. Rafael is showing himself as the best player on the pitch here and it's seems a little bizarre that his first-team prospects are in doubt under Van Gaal when you consider Antonio Valencia's recent form.. Spurs are producing some good passing play and at times Falcao is reduced to feeding off scraps in the air up against young defenders. Surely he couldn't have envisaged that when he arrived back in August. Meanwhile, Sportsmail's Mike Keegan reports that the steadily growing crowd at Old Trafford are finding their voices after the goal. Just when Spurs looked to be getting on top goalkeeper Luke McGee drops a bit of a clanger. He collects the ball from a cross ahead of Falcao and looks to bowl it out to a team-mate. Instead it hits Rafael and the Brazilian has all the time in the world to send a sumptuous chip back over the goalkeeper's head and into the net. Left-footed, and from 35 yards. Impressive. 1-1. Awful pass out of the area from Donald Love for Manchester United and Shaquile Coulthirst latches on to a ball back in. A brilliant bit of skill gets him away from his marker but a cheeky chipped finish past Valdes drops just wide. Close. Shades of United's defeat on Monday night here.... Shocking back pass from Joe Rothwell and it arrives at the feet of Spurs' Kenny McEvoy. He advances forward past one challenger and slots in an excellent finish past Victor Valdes. Ah, that's not so good from the on-loan forward. James Wilson makes an excellent run cutting in from the right wing and fires in a thunderous left-footed shot. It looks to be going on target but instead the smashes into the back of Falcao and out of play. Whoops. Joshua Onomah, a star of Spurs' FA Youth Cup semi-final first leg win over Chelsea last week, has a chance to put his side ahead after being played in over the top. Unfortunately for the visitors he blasts over from a tight angle. Another chance for Falcao, this time he teams up with Rafael again and is one-on-one with marker Bongani Khumalo but he can't break past him and the tackle dispossess him. Sean Goss follows up and fires narrowly wide from 20 yards. The stands are filling up at Old Trafford a little more during the opening stages - it's not every night you get a £40million-rated star striker playing in a free-entry game. Grant Ward's free-kick for Tottenham the only real dangerous opportunity so far. Rafael is another United first-team player hoping to impress tonight and he bursts into the box down the right but a deep cross cannot be controlled by Falcao and Spurs clear. The Colombian has been flagged offside once and at least seems willing to get himself about - this could be a positive evening for him. Meanwhile a brilliant run from Grant Ward for Tottenham draws a foul and Spurs have a free-kick in a dangerous area, but it's sent well over the bar into an empty Stretford End. Manchester United's expensive loanee has his first opportunity of the game, receiving the ball in off the right flank and trying to turn a marker inside the area. The ball gets tangled under his feet though and the chance is gone. Not the greatest start, but a start nonetheless. The two teams are out, with Falcao at the back of the United line-up and we've kicked off. Louis van Gaal's assistant manager Ryan Giggs is in attendance at Old Trafford tonight and is sitting alongside his former team-mate Nicky Butt. If Falcao wants a place in the side to face Tottenham's first team this weekend then he'll have to show something to impress Giggs. The two teams tonight sit joint top of the Barclays Under 21 Premier League (although Spurs have a game in hand), so tonight's result will decide who becomes the outright leader. It might be United's only chance of silverware this season after their FA Cup exit on Monday night, which you can read Martin Samuel's match report for HERE. United are expected to play a 4-1-2-1 diamond, with Falcao and Wilson leading the line, a pairing that has faced Yeovil and Cambridge United in the FA Cup this season. And if you're wondering how United can field Falcao in this competition, here's a bit of context for you: . Here's tonight's team sheet from Old Trafford, courtesy of Sportsmail's Mike Keegan.

"Adnan Januzaj must have hoped that between Angel di Maria being sent off and Antonio Valencia's poor defending, eyes would be off him for Manchester United - but his blatant dive at Old Trafford was clear to see for everyone, including the referee. The United youngster now has five yellow cards for diving compared to four goals, and added to the embarrassment for Louis van Gaal's side in their FA Cup defeat by Arsenal with his blatant simulation attempt in the 87th minute on Monday night as the 10-man home side chased the lead. Making it into the penalty area ahead of Nacho Monreal, the Belgian went to ground in search of a late penalty but instead the only reaction Michael Oliver gave him was to dish out a yellow card. Adnan Januzaj breaks into the penalty area in the 87th minute of the FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford . The Belgian midfielder was being closely tracked by Nacho Monreal, who had earlier scored for Arsenal . Well clear of the defender, Januzaj bends his ankle as he begins to head for the deck in the 2-1 defeat . Januazj falls but referee Michael Oliver was having none of it and issued him with a yellow card for simulation . The referee got an earful from the Stretford End faithful and United captain Wayne Rooney but was right to caution Januzaj, who made it into the all-time Barclays Premier League top two  for simulation bookings in his first full season in United's first team. Sportsmail's Graham Poll agreed with Oliver's decision and was impressed with his performance, saying: 'Oliver was brave and correct again when Adnan Januzaj clearly dived in front of the Stretford End – some players never learn.' Di Maria had already been booked for diving by Oliver, moments before he earned a second yellow card for inexplicably grabbing the official. And between him and Januzaj, the home side were left even more embarrassed at Old Trafford while Arsenal fans rejoiced in the stands - and that was already after two defensive errors was their final hope of a trophy extinguished. A bad night for Van Gaal's men. Januzaj (centre) appeals to Oliver while United's players hold their heads in disappointment at Old Trafford .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has spent 21 months since returning to Stamford Bridge trying to mould the team spirit that he craves - and now he seems to have achieved it, labelling his side as a band of 'brothers'. Chelsea ground out a hard-fought 1-0 win over West Ham on Wednesday night and their manager reserved special praise for the togetherness of his players, with John Terry and co embracing at the final whistle before applauding the travelling support. The scenes were similar to a defining game of Mourinho's first spell at Chelsea, in an away game at Blackburn in February 2005 when Arjen Robben split the sides in a gritty Ewood Park clash.

Mourinho celebrates victory at full-time in what he considers one of the toughest away games of the season . And manager Mourinho believes that collective show of strength is exactly the sort of thing the league leaders will need to get them over the line in the Barclays Premier League title race. The Special One also confirmed that his players would be enjoying two days off with a week's gap until they play Paris Saint-Germain in the return of their Champions League last-16 tie. ‘My team were brothers on the pitch,' Mourinho said. 'That is important if you are to win the most difficult league in the world. I want to sleep now until midday. We could easily have lost two points. ‘The way West Ham play, nobody is better than them. They are the best at the way they play. It is not just to play football, the pressure, the tension and the emotion, my players were fantastic. ‘I told the referee is it very difficult to be a ref here, because of the style of their game. Lots of long balls. West Ham had lots of balls in the box, very difficult, very intense and really difficult for the referee. They complain for everything, the crowd is behind them and it is really, really difficult.' The Chelsea players, led by Mourinho (fourth left) leave the pitch at Ewood Park after winning in 2005 .

Eden Hazard scored the winner at Upton Park and was one of Chelsea's best players even after playing a full part in Chelsea's Capital One Cup final triumph over Tottenham on Sunday. And Mourinho led the plaudits for the playmaker who he has criticised in the past for his work ethic. 'Eden Hazard was fantastic,' he said. 'He is punished by opponents in a very hard way. Not in a violent way, just an aggressive football way because they tried to stop him but the kid is playing, scoring and defending.' But the Portuguese coach was less impressed with the rescheduling of Chelsea's game against Leicester, which could have been held this weekend with both clubs out of the FA Cup but will instead take place on April 9. ‘It is not a good thing that we play Leicester in two months now - that’s not a good thing, for someone in the title race to have played one match less,' he said.

"Gary Neville says he is a worried that Liverpool's recent form will see them knock Manchester United out of the Barclays Premier League top four and leave them without Champions League football for a second successive year. Liverpool face Burnley at Anfield on Wednesday night having taken 19 points from a possible 21 in the last two months while United have stumbled, claiming just 13 in the same period. Louis van Gaal's side travel on Newcastle United on Wednesday ahead of a daunting run of fixtures that includes Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea within their next seven games. Liverpool have emerged as serious contenders for a top four place in the Barclays Premier League . Manchester United defeated Sunderland at the weekend but are far from firing on all cylinders . Gary Neville fears Liverpool could leapfrog Manchester United and take the final Champions League spot . And United legend Neville is concerned that his former club will be unable to hold off the Merseyside club in the fight for a top-four place as the season reaches its biting point. 'For the first time this season I am concerned as to whether Manchester United can fight them off in the scrap for the Champions League places,' Neville wrote in his Daily Telegraph column. 'It’s fair to say Liverpool have emerged as much more of a threat than I considered a few weeks ago. Neville believes the Anfield club are as well equipped as anyone to take the final Champions League spot . Record £60million signing Angel di Maria has struggled for form along with his United team-mates . 'I arrived at Anfield expecting City to reassert themselves in the title race and make their extra few days preparation. It both impressed and concerned me to see Liverpool play as they did.' Chelsea and United's local rivals City are widely expected to take up two of the Premier League's four qualification places and with Arsenal going strong in third place, United, Liverpool, Southampton and Tottenham will all be eyeing the last spot. 'Liverpool look as well equipped as any side to take that final Champions League spot now,' Neville added. 'They've stopped conceding goals, have found a system that works for their players and have their high intensity game back.'

"Paris Saint-Germain might be going into their Champions League second leg against Chelsea as underdogs, but defender Maxwell thinks Chelsea got lucky in their previous 1-1 draw and hopes to reach the quarter-finals with a win on Wednesday. Edinson Cavani levelled the tie at the Parc des Princes with his second-half strike cancelling out Branislav Ivanovic's away goal - and Chelsea certainly owed some of the credit for a decent result to goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Manager Jose Mourinho admitted as much, labelling the Belgian stopper as 'phenomenal' post-match - and now PSG defender Maxwell has spoken out, saying that he was what kept Chelsea in the tie in Paris last month. Paris Saint-Germain defender Maxwell (top) celebrates a goal in their 4-1 win over Lens on Saturday . Thibaut Courtois (right) earned the praise of his manager Jose Mourinho and Maxwell for his first-leg display . 'We played very well in the first leg and showed that we are capable of beating Chelsea,' the Brazilian defender said. 'They saved the result because of their goalkeeper. 'The first leg has brought us a lot of confidence and we head into the return leg looking to qualify.'

Javier Pastore (left) celebrates with Maxwell during the weekend's 4-1 win which will have raised confidence . After the 1-1 draw, when asked whether Chelsea were let off the hook, his manager Mourinho said: 'When you see the performance of our goalkeeper, you have to say yes. He made two or three important saves in the game. 'I think 1-1 reflects one half for Chelsea, one half for Paris. But if you go to chances created and the goalkeepers' performances, we have to be honest and say they had more than us. If somebody was closer to winning the game, it was Paris and not Chelsea.' PSG fly to London on Tuesday hoping for better luck than in last year's away goals exit to the same opponents with a 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge following a 3-1 win in Paris.

"Former Manchester United player Ray Wilkins believes Radamel Falcao has not done enough to earn a permanent deal at the club - and says he looks a shadow of his former self. Falcao, on a season-long loan at Old Trafford from Monaco, has been a huge disappointment having notched just four goals in 20 appearances since moving to the Barclays Premier League. A series of poor performances have seen him left out of Louis van Gaal's side of late and with Monaco expecting a fee for around £40million for the former Atletico Madrid striker in the summer, United face a tough decision over his future. Radamel Falcao has been a disappointment at Manchester United and it looks unlikely that they will sign him . Ray Wilkins cannot see United taking up the option of signing Falcao with the way his form has been . Van Gaal seems so disappointed in the forward that he left him on the bench away at Newcastle United on Wednesday night - even when United were desperate for a goal in the closing stages. And former United midfielder Wilkins feels that Falcao's days are numbered after failing to convince the club to invest even more money in him. 'Falcao has been struggling for goals,' Wilkins told talkSPORT. 'He hasn't shown any type of form that we expected when he arrived at Manchester United.' Falcao chases down a ball at Old Trafford, but he has recently found himself benched by Louis van Gaal . Sunderland defender Patrick van Aanholt gets to grips with Falcao, who has struggled for form in England . The 29-year-old cost Monaco over £40m when signed a year-and-half ago from Atletico Madrid, where he forged a reputation as a goalscorer and netted a hat-trick against Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup in 2012. But Wilkins says he is nowhere near the standards that he showed at that game in Monaco. 'His form has been very poor in fact, we haven't seen anything like the player who absolutely destroyed Chelsea with Atletico Madrid a few years back,' he said. 'They have already paid a huge loan fee and his wages are extremely expensive. To take him on would require a big fee, I would think they will look elsewhere.' Falcao was at St James' Park for United's trip to face Newcastle United but didn't make it off the bench .","Radamel Falcao has just four goals in 20 games for Manchester United .

"Cristiano Ronaldo's stylist will be used to the Ballon d'Or winners high maintenance preening by now - but it must seem like a weird part of the job when he is sent to perform beauty treatments on his waxwork. The Museo de Cera in Madrid has held a statue of the Real Madrid superstar since December 2013, and it is one of the most popular of hundreds of celebrity waxworks.

"Southampton's Champions League qualification hopes have cooled of late - so it was perhaps fitting that manager Ronald Koeman took his players to snowy Switzerland for a mid-season team break. The Barclays Premier League's surprise package of the season have dropped off the pace in the race for the top four recently, and their Dutch boss has seen fit to organise a three-day football-free trip to the Swiss Alps - and Koeman even found time to play ice hockey as his team take a break from training.

"It might not have seemed like it at the time, but Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes his side's 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace back in November was the best thing that has happened to them this season. The November 23 loss at Selhurst Park saw Liverpool drop as low as 12th in the Barclays Premier League, but a spectacular turn in form since has seen Rodgers mark the defeat as the turning point that sparked a top-four charge.

"Chelsea youngster Ruben Loftus-Cheek would be playing regularly in the Barclays Premier League if his side weren't under pressure in a title race situation, according to manager Jose Mourinho. Loftus-Cheek was on the bench for Chelsea's 1-0 win over West Ham on Wednesday and is now a full-time member of Mourinho's first-team squad having made substitute appearances against Sporting Lisbon and Manchester City this season. And Mourinho believes the 19-year-old midfielder is ready to play in the first team at Chelsea, although he is yet to start a game even in the absence of Nemanja Matic or John Obi Mikel. Ruben Loftus-Cheek would already be playing for Chelsea if the pressure wasn't so great, says Jose Mourinho . Mourinho had high praise for Loftus-Cheek despite him not appearing from the bench against West Ham . Mourinho rates the 19-year-old midfielder and has used him against Sporting Lisbon and Manchester City . Find out more about Ruben Loftus-Cheek with Sportsmail's guide to the 19-year-old midfielder HERE. 'I had Ruben Loftus-Cheek on the bench and I have to say that, in my opinion, next year, this kid will be a big surprise in the Premier League,' Mourinho said after the win over West Ham. 'This season, if I was not playing for the title and if we were not playing with the pressure we have when you are playing for the title, this kid would already be on the pitch. 'But it's step-by-step and today  was again a day for (Kurt) Zouma to help John (Terry) and (Gary) Cahill in a game when (Diafra) Sakho and (Enner) Valencia are very difficult opponents.' Loftus-Cheek could even see more game-time before the end of the season, with Mourinho likely to rest players for a potential Champions League bid if Chelsea wrap up the title early enough. The youngster has already been earmarked as a future England international by Mourinho and previously attracted the interest of Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona.

"Contrary to reports earlier this season that Barcelona players - and particularly Lionel Messi - were unhappy with head coach Luis Enrique, midfielder Ivan Rakitic has thrown his backing behind his boss, and says the rest of the Barca squad rate him, too. A tough start to the season in La Liga that saw Barca fall away from league leaders Real Madrid had Enrique under pressure within weeks of taking the job, but a brilliant turnaround in form seems to have swung things in his favour. Enrique's charges are now just two points behind Real after clawing back the lead with a run that has seen them drop just eight points from their last 15 league games, and look well set for the Champions League quarter-finals after their 2-1 first leg win away at Manchester City. Ivan Rakitic says Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique has the backing of his players, who see him as the boss . Enrique was under pressure earlier this season and was said to have a difficult relationship with some players . And that transformation looks to have been helped by the attitude of his players who, according to summer signing Rakitic, are all behind their boss. '(Luis Enrique) is the boss and he knows what is best,' the Croatian told Sportske Novosti. 'We all believe in him. 'Our success is in the collective act of all for one and one for all.' Luis Suarez congratulates Rakitic after he scored the opening goal against Granada in a 3-1 win on Saturday . The victory helped to close the gap on Real Madrid and Barca are now in with a shout of silverware . Enrique knows what's best, according to Rakitic, who spoke of the collective Barca group in an interview . Rakitic scored Barca's opener in their 3-1 win over Granada on Saturday to close the gap on Real, who could only draw with Villarreal, but the midfielder says he is making no time to think about the fortunes of the current leaders. 'Today, Real are ahead but the road is a long one,' Rakitic said. 'We just think about ourselves, as there is no need to think about Real. 'We believe that everything is possible.' Lionel Messi later scored in the 3-1 win over Granada to bring Barcelona to 59 points, just two behind Real .

"Per Mertesacker says that a frank team meeting between the defenders has sorted out the problems that bedevilled Arsenal's first leg of their Champions League tie against Monaco. The Gunners face Monaco on Tuesday night knowing they must score at least three times after their 3-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium last month. But Mertesacker, the Arsenal vice-captain claims that the response of the team since that result – with four straight wins, including the FA Cup sixth-round victory at Manchester United, and in conceding just two goals since then – is an indication that the team is ready to overturn the two-goal deficit and produce an extraordinary comeback. Per Mertesacker speaks to the assembled media ahead of Arsenal's Champions League tie in Monaco . The World Cup winner shares a joke with Mesut Ozil as the Gunners prepare for their second-leg clash . 'We speak a lot to each other, even when we win,' said Mertesacker. 'We need to learn after defeat and winning. We always try to improve as a defensive unit. It’s always a topic to analyse things that went right and things went wrong. ‘After that game lot of things didn’t go well. That is a mental thing for tomorrow. We know mentally that we weren’t really up for it and at times we could feel there was a bit of pressure and we couldn’t really cope with that. 'But we feel after the game we moved on from that and that’s why we’re confident we can beat any team in the world. ‘We’re coming out of great week with two important wins and a good level of confidence.

"Chelsea and Everton have both been fined £30,000 by the FA for player misconduct in their February 11 clash at Stamford Bridge. Players from both teams became embroiled in a melee four minutes before the end of Chelsea's 1-0 win, and the clubs have now been charged with 'failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from provocative behaviour'. The charge against Chelsea also claims that their players surrounded referee Jonathan Moss 'and/or became involved in a mass confrontation'. Chelsea and Everton have been fined over the mass confrontation towards the end of their February meeting . Branislav Ivanovic escaped punishment despite appearing to aim a headbutt at Everton's James McCarthy . Branislav Ivanovic escaped a personal punishment despite appearing to aim a headbutt at Everton's James McCarthy during the incident. Chelsea and Everton both admitted the charges and were  warned about their future conduct. The incident sparked up after a Gareth Barry's foul on Willian that saw him dismissed for a second bookable offence. Referee Moss also showed cards to McCarthy, Cesc Fabregas and Ramires after the coming together. After the game Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho walked out of a BBC interview when asked about the Ivanovic incident and when questioned by BT Sport, he replied: ‘Don’t make me laugh, don’t make me laugh.’ Ivanovic grabs hold of McCarthy in the melee that led to both Chelsea and Everton being fined £30,000 . Angry Chelsea and Everton players square up in front of the dugouts as Jonathan Moss tries to take control . In his post-match press conference, Mourinho threatened another walk-out, saying: ‘I’m concerned with my reaction because one more question (about this) and I will leave.’ Mourinho was critical of Everton, adding: ‘They made lots of fouls, what you would call intelligent fouls, but if the referee follows the rule it’s yellow card after yellow card and then inevitably you get a red card — which they eventually did.’ Everton manager Roberto Martinez was in no doubt that Ivanovic should have seen red over the alleged butt. ‘If you look at the images Ivanovic’s behaviour is wrong,’ said Martinez. ‘He grabs him around the neck in a forceful manner then puts his head against him when James McCarthy didn’t react, and if you want to be on top of the laws that’s a red card.’ Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to talk about the melee or Ivanovic's actions .","Chelsea and Everton have both been fined £30,000 by the FA .

"Massimiliano Alegri has warned his players to brace themselves for an important week as Juventus look to continue their push towards the Serie title and bid to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The Italian champions take on 11th-place Palermo on Saturday as they chase down their fourth consecutive Scudetto before travelling to Germany to to defend a 2-1 lead over Brussia Dortmund on Wednesday. Juve currently hold an 11-point lead over nearest rivals Roma but Allegri insists there is still work to do to secure the title as the club head into what the coach describes as a decisive week. Massimiliano Allegri says his Juventus players must be on top of their game ahead of a decisive few days . Paul Pogba celebrates after scoring the winner against Sassuolo on Monday . 'We begin a week that's more or less decisive as far as the league's concerned, which still hasn't been won, and the Champions League, where we've got a knockout game,' he said. 'But for now we'll just stay focused on Palermo. 'I think we'll have a difficult game because they're in a healthy position in the table and can play quite a carefree game. 'There will also be a full stadium and playing Juventus will provide a huge boost for them, I think. 'Crucially, they have shown themselves to be strong at home, they've taken 26 points at home, so it will not be an easy game.' Juventus maintained their 11-point lead at the top of Serie A with the victory . Allegri insists that Juventus still have work to do in the title race ahead of Saturday's game against Palermo . Juventus have been heavily linked with Palermo's impressive 21-year-old striker Paulo Dybala, who has netted 12 Serie A goals this season, but Allegri was giving nothing away when asked about the Argentinian. 'I think Dybala can get even better and eventually play for a great team,' Allegri said. Former AC Milan coach Allegri added that his side will have to be at their very best to reach the last eight of the Champions League but insisted the ambition is to turn Juventus into one of the best teams in Europe.

"As soon as Jose Mourinho declared Chelsea's Capital One Cup final against Tottenham as the most important final of his distinguished managerial career, it was hard to see past The Special One's side. And that could, in part, be down to the Chelsea manager's brilliant record in cup finals: he's lost just one final across 11 full seasons as a coach, winning 10 along the way plus seven league titles and four Community Shields or Super Cups. That makes it 21 trophies across 727 games,  an average of a winner's medal every 35 matches. Jose Mourinho holds the Capital One Cup aloft, it is the 21st trophy of his career as a manager . The Portuguese coach lifts the cup in delight, and  he believes 'finals are not for playing, they are for winning' The ecstatic Chelsea boss showed a contrasting mood to the miserable figure from recent press conferences . June 15, 2003: Taca de Portugal final. Porto 1-0 Uniao de Leiria. May 21, 2003: UEFA Cup final. Celtic 2-3 Porto (after extra time). May 26, 2004: Champions League final. Monaco 0-3 Porto.

May 17, 2013: Copa del Rey final. Real Madrid 1-2 Atletico Madrid (aet) March 1, 2015: Capital One Cup final. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham. 'Finals are not for playing, they are for winning,' Mourinho said at full-time at Wembley, and he certainly believes in his own words given the impressive record he holds on show-piece occasions like Sunday. Victory over Spurs ended a two-year mini-drought for Mourinho, having come through a difficult final season at Real Madrid before failing in all three cup competitions and finishing third in the Barclays Premier League with Chelsea last season. That was his longest stretch without a trophy while in constant employment as a manager - and Sunday marked his first cup final success in almost four years. The only final that a Mourinho-led team has been beaten in came in 2013's Copa de Rey final when Real Madrid were defeated 2-1 by local rivals Atletico Madrid - and even then it took extra time to kill off Mourinho. Prior to that though, he had won all nine of his previous finals, picking up the Taca de Portugal, UEFA Cup and Champions League with Porto, two Carling Cups and an FA Cup in his first spell at Chelsea, a Coppa Italia and Champions League with Inter Milan and a Copa del Rey with Real. The stats show Chelsea's master motivator knows how to gee up his players for the big occasion: you don't have such a strong record without that ability.

"Tony Irish, the boss of the international players’ union, has criticised the ICC over their decision to cut the 2019 World Cup in England to 10 teams, saying: ‘The global game needs a global view.’ With the likes of Ireland and Afghanistan – two of the more engaging sides in this year’s tournament – in danger of missing out on qualification in four years’ time, the ICC have faced tough questions over their commitment to spreading the game beyond its 10 Test-playing Full Members. But Irish’s comments, part of a wide-ranging interview with Sportsmail about some of the major issues faced by international cricket, carry particular significance: FICA, the Federation of International Cricketers’ Associations of which he is chief executive, represents the players unions in England, Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa and West Indies. Tony Irish, the South African boss of the international players’ union, says cricket needs a global view and not a 10-game World Cup that the ICC has planned for 2019 that will exclude the likes of Ireland (above) Fans of Afghanistan, who haven't been disgraced in their first World Cup in Australia and New Zealand . In other words, he is speaking on behalf of the majority of the world’s top cricketers. ‘FICA takes a global view on the game,’ said Irish. ‘One of the objectives must be to try to grow the global game. The opportunity for other countries to participate in the World Cup, the pinnacle tournament, is important. ‘However, we do accept the challenge relating to the length of the event. We think we should look at reformatting the event, perhaps into four pools, or having a pre-qualifier.’ Irish, whose push for FICA to play a greater role in determining the game’s future has not been helped by India’s refusal to form their own players’ union, said the format of future World Cups should not be influenced by the TV-driven desire to guarantee as many group matches as possible for the Indians. Afghan and New Zealand playes come together after their World Cup  pool A match in Napier . ‘One can understand that from a commercial point of view, and from the point of view of satisfying the biggest cricket market,’ he said. ‘But you’ve got to balance against that the fact that a sporting event is a sporting event, and if a team performs poorly in a particular format, then that’s how the results go. The growth of the game is equally important. ‘The ICC has 105 members – 10 Full Members, and a number of competitive Associate members. The important thing is that the body that administers the global game needs to have a global view.’ Irish, who also heads up the South African players’ association, questioned how Associate nations were supposed to get exposure against the Full Members when the international schedule is already full to bursting. India haven't got a players' union which hinders the international union's powers to push for an inclusive game . He said: ‘There’s very little framework any more to the Future Tours Programme. It’s not being governed by a set of principles which allows… cricket to have a greater context. It’s a lot of individual agreements between countries, which are just plugged into a matrix. ‘It’s a pity the world Test championship has been shelved. The team rankings give some sort of context, but they’re extremely difficult to understand.’ And Irish is concerned that the takeover of the ICC by the Indian, English and Australian boards last year will result in an increasingly unlevel playing field at international level. Though the ICC have promised more funds to all Full Members and the best six Associate teams as a result of their latest broadcasting deal, many are worried that the Big Three will pull away from the Small Seven because they will simply schedule more lucrative series against between themselves. Under the old FTP, teams were obliged to play each other home and away every four years in series of at least two Tests and three one-day internationals. Now, the fixture list is drawn up on the basis of individual agreements between teams. ‘The fear is that the stronger countries will just play each other more and more, and the weaker countries will have less opportunity to play the stronger countries,’ said Irish. ‘The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.’ For a full transcript of the interview, click here .","The ICC has cut the 2019 World Cup to be held in England to 10 teams .
