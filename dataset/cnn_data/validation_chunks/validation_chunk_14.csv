"Arsenal scouts will watch Dynamo Kiev centre-back Aleksandar Dragovic against Everton on Thursday. The 24-year-old Austria international is being touted as one of the best defenders in Europe and is keen to leave Ukraine in the summer. Kiev want around £15million for him but that has not deterred the likes of Borussia Dortmund who see him as a potential replacement for Mats Hummels. Arsenal will send scouts to watch Dynamo Kiev defender Aleksandar Dragovic against Everton on Thursday . Dragovic (left) is valued at £15million and is also attracting interest from Manchester United and Dortmund . The Austria international moved to Ukraine from Swiss side Basle in 2013 . Manchester United and West Ham have also watched Dragovic closely over recent months. United remain unconvinced about his consistency while any deal may prove too rich for West Ham. Arsenal have just signed Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal but know they need greater strength in depth as they wrestle with continued injury problems and the inconsistent form of Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. Manchester United's Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling have also been discussed at Arsenal as they weigh up more summer spending. Arsene Wenger remains keen on adding another midfielder, full-back and striker to his squad.","Aleksandar Dragovic is a central defender for Ukraine outfit Dynamo Kiev .

"Maybe it is a formality, after all. Brendan Rodgers said recently no decision had been made on who would be Liverpool’s next captain but is there really a decision to make? For all that Liverpool’s manager will not be rushed into anointing Steven Gerrard’s successor, Jordan Henderson is compiling a case that is becoming impossible to overlook. He did exactly what a Liverpool skipper should do, making the difference in a game of great significance. Fresh from unleashing a thunderbolt that unhinged Manchester City, Henderson delivered once again, with a goal, an assist – his 11th of the season – for Daniel Sturridge and 90-minutes of relentless running in a 2-0 win that enhanced his side’s Champions League ambitions.

Booked: Mee . Manager: Sean Dyche 6 . Referee: Lee Mason 6.5 . Attendance: 44,717 . Man of the Match: Jordan Henderson . Daniel Sturridge caps off a well worked Liverpool move to give his side a 2-0 lead on 51 minutes. This may not have been as eye-catching as Sunday’s tour de force but it was no less impressive. They were ruthless, efficient and energetic with excellent performers all over the pitch and in Henderson, Rodgers had someone to set the necessary example. ‘We were talking before the game about how well he (Henderson) is doing,’ noted Sturridge. ‘He is improving in every game and he has taken the responsibility with the armband. He has taken it to the next level.’ These are the types of games that Gerrard, watching in the Directors Box, has grabbed by the scruff of the neck and he would have nodded approvingly at the way Henderson led Liverpool in his absence. So, too, would Rodgers. Games that come so soon after significant victories can often become tests of endurance rather than opportunities to make statements and there was a reason to believe, having expended so much energy against City, that Burnley could make things difficult. Liverpool started, however, with intent. Quick, aggressive, energetic, they burst out of the blocks and could have had the lead within 24 seconds when move full of deft flicks and subtle touches, that brought Anfield to its feet, ended with Tom Heaton flinging himself to thwart Sturridge.

Sturridge (right) uses his pace to lose his marker, Burnley defender Ben Mee (left) and advance forward on the opposition goal . Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren (left) climbs highest to head the ball away from Burnley striker Ashley Barnes (right) Yet Burnley were not daunted. Gerrard noted in his programme notes that “nobody has it easy” against Sean Dyche’s side and they were intent of making this a contest, just as they had done at the Etihad Stadium and Stamford Bridge. At one point, when Martin Skrtel scuffed a clearance that nearly allowed Burnley to profit, Rodgers span on his heels and shook his head, anxious Liverpool might not capitalise on that big effort three days prior to topple the champions. His anxieties, though, were soon quelled. Henderson had served notice of his intent in the 24th minute, when forcing a plunging save from Heaton, but there was nothing Burnley’s keeper could do when the ball fell to him on the half-hour and he rifled in a swerving half-volley into the Kop net. Henderson might not commands big headlines but his importance to this Liverpool team should not be taken for granted and this was a vital contribution, his goal releasing the tension. With 16 months left on his current deal, Liverpool must surely endeavour to finalise a new contract for him. ‘His strike was terrific and so was the ball for the second goal,’ said Liverpool’s manager. ‘He has wonderful athleticism and is improving all the time. With him learning tactically he will become even better. It was a wonderful performance by him.’ Had Sturridge taken a glorious chance in the 42nd minute, when Coutinho ushered him through, the game would have been wrapped up but, as it was, Liverpool were given a reminder in injury time that they still had work to do when Ashley Barnes tested Simon Mignolet with a header. Burnley came out fighting at the re-start and Mignolet needed to take dramatic action in the 48th minute when he surged out of his goal to head away a ball that was Barnes was chasing, clattering into the forward in the process. Danny Ings (centre) presses forward for Burnley but is challenged by Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling (right) Reds striker Sturridge (right) again battles Burnley's Michael Keane (left) with Liverpool firmly in control of the game . Jordan Henderson rises highest send a headed effort towards Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal at Anfield on Wednesday night . Henderson’s strike meant Liverpool scored three Premier League goals in a row from outside the penalty area for the first time since 2007. Yet any hope they had of a comeback was soon extinguished. Liverpool pushed forward, with Lallana bobbing and weaving on the edge of the area, trying to find a way through; Henderson arrived to provide support and his precise cross demanded Sturridge apply the finish touch. Job done. From that point on, there was never any suggestion Liverpool, who have collected 30 point from the last 36 available, would falter, particularly with Emre Can – the hugely impressive German whom Rodgers labelled as being on the verge of “world-class” – helping Henderson set the tone. With good reason, Liverpool will be looking at their fixtures in the spring and sensing an opportunity to attack but so, too, do Burnley. This might have been an eighth game without winning but he is not in the mood to thrown in the towel. ‘Liverpool were a different side to the one we (lost to) on Boxing Day,’ said Dyche. ‘I would have taken being in this position with 10 games to go. There are teams under more pressure than we are.’ Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers beams as he watches a dominant display from his side against relegation battlers Burnley . Daniel Sturridge loses his man and leaps to score a headed goal and give Liverpool a 2-0 lead over Sean Dyche's men at Anfield .

"Slobs are people who are 'lazy and dirty or messy' or just simply 'ordinary', according to the dictionary. They are also the offensive lineman for the reigning NCAA football champion Ohio State Buckeyes. Being a slob requires a player to be 'mean' and 'nasty', be able to work hard' and 'know how to eat'' like a 'human garbage disposal'. Scroll down for video .

Junior  Chase Farris said: 'When we slob, we slob together. There's no single slobs. It's just a group of slobs' Former Buckeye Andrew Norwell, who now plays guard for the Carolina Panthers in the NFL, created the name in 2013, according to The Zone. Norwell came up with nickname while he was drawing pictures in the team's meeting room. Right guard Pat Elflein explained: 'He'd just draw a bunch of goofy pictures and just mash a bunch of animals together. 'He'd just make them look real funny together, and one of them, he made one of them and he called it a slob. 'It was a big, ugly, thing and it just kind of caught on that we're the slobs.' The name caught on and the guys on the team kept using it when Norwell moved on. They will continue to use the affectionate term in the coming season as four out of five of the team's starting offensive lineman will be returning, the Columbus Dispatch reported. Junior linemen Chase Farris said: 'A slob isn't what you look like, a slob is how you act, it's what you are, it's what you do.' 'We go eat, we slob. When we're together in the meeting room, we slob. 'When we're on the field, we slob. 'When we slob, we slob together. 'There's no single slobs. It's just a group of slobs.'

He said: 'I mean, they are human garbage disposals. 'They eat 8,000 calories a day, and they look pretty good doing it, so if I tried to keep up with them you'd have to get 4XL for me.'

"For Italy manager Antonio Conte, Tuesday's friendly against England in Turin should have represented a triumphant homecoming to the stadium where he led Juventus to three Serie A titles before leaving last summer. After all, he remains unbeaten in charge of the Azzurri and Saturday night's 2-2 draw in Bulgaria keeps them firmly on course to qualify for Euro 2016. But instead of being guaranteed a hero's reception, Conte returns 'home' beset by the same kind of problems that England manager Roy Hodgson and FA chief Greg Dyke will recognise all too well from the perspective of another struggling superpower. Italy manager Antonio Conte led Juventus to a trio of Serie A titles before leaving last summer . A bitter club vs country row over an injury to Juventus midfielder Claudio Marchisio on international duty has made Hodgson's spat with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers over Raheem Sterling 'Tiredgate' and Daniel Sturridge look like a vicar's tea party. John Elkann, an influential figure at Juventus, said Marchisio's knee sprain on Friday - originally diagnosed by the Italian FA medical staff as ligament damage - was due to being over-worked and said: 'Perhaps Conte would like to be remembered as the cherry-picker with the highest number of injuries.' It was inflammatory talk and the Italian football federation claimed Conte had received death threats from Juve fans over the internet as a result. In addition, there has been criticism of Conte's decision to include two South American-born players Eder and Franco Vazquez in his squad due to Italy's declining homegrown talent pool. Again, it is reminiscent of overtures made by England to Manchester United's Belgian winger Adnan Januzaj last year, a move that was condemned by Arsenal star Jack Wilshere and forced Dyke into a hasty U-turn. Conte has come under fire following an injury to Juventus star Claudio Marchisio (right) Against such a malignant backdrop, The Italian football federation will be relieved sensible ticket pricing means more families and less embittered Juve supporters will turn up on Tuesday to watch two nations who failed together to qualify from the same group at last summer's World Cup. Even more than in England, there is plenty of navel-gazing, politics and recriminations going on. And Conte, 45, remains half-irritated, half-cryptic about the gathering storm clouds above his head. 'I have the memory of an elephant. I only ask to be left to work in peace,' he said enigmatically after Eder had scored a stunning equaliser in rainy Sofia as a riposte to Roberto Mancini and others who condemned his inclusion. Conte is also certain Juventus hold a grudge against him because he left in order to replace Cesare Prandelli at national level. The Azzurri players are certainly behind Conte. Without attacking stars like Paolo Rossi, Roberto Baggio or Francesco Totti to call upon, the manager has had to rely on teamwork, a 3-5-2 system with wingbacks, and loyalty to his squad. Conte has also been criticised for including South American-born player Eder in his Italy squad . Southampton striker Graziano Pelle has kept his place despite a run of one goal in 16 matches for his club and should be involved on Tuesday night where he could face club-mate Nathaniel Clyne. 'He (Conte) is a really good manager. In Italy, it's normal people try to say something bad about the manager but the players have confidence in him, he has given us a lot of new ideas,' said Pelle. 'There are people who agree or disagree that Eder should have been picked. As players, we are glad he is with us because he has a lot of quality. I played with him for Sampdoria and gave him the No17 shirt to wear against Bulgaria because I scored in it last time – I said it would bring him luck! 'He is part of Italy now and he has to show he is proud of it. It has happened before and will happen again.' Southampton striker Graziano Pelle has kept his place despite a run of one goal in 16 matches for his club . The reaction of home fans to Eder, who moved to Italy at the age of 16, and Argentine-born Vazquez will be interesting. Diego Costa, born and raised in Brazil, was jeered by some Spanish fans when he elected to play for his adopted country, and Mancini is among those to condemn the selection of oriundi (immigrant Italians). However, Conte supporters point out Italy's World Cup-winning teams of 1934, 1938 and 2006 all included players born overseas, the most recent example being Mauro Camoranese from Argentina. Italy needed Eder, named after the 1982 Brazilian World Cup star, in Bulgaria having surrendered an early 1-0 lead to trail 2-1. He was thrown on by Conte to salvage a point and did so with an exquisite turn and right-foot finish that would have done justice to the original Eder. On Sunday, Conte called up Newcastle United defender Davide Santon, currently on loan at Inter Milan, and Ignazio Abate to the squad to face England. Marchisio is ruled out, Andrea Bertolacci is doubtful with a shoulder injury and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon missed out in Sofia with flu. 'It'll be a prestigious friendly, so we'll test out some players who I have called up,' said Conte.","Antonio Conte's Italy side face England in a friendly game on Tuesday .

"Manchester United defender Jonny Evans has released a statement denying the allegations that he spat at Papiss Cisse on Wednesday night. However, in contrast, the Newcastle star has offered his apologies after reacting to something 'very unpleasant'. Evans clashed with the opposing striker during United's 1-0 victory at St James' Park, with both appearing to spit at each other. Cisse was also pictured wiping something off of his face. But Evans says he is shocked by the accusations and that it is not in his character to do anything of the sort, despite the footage, and Cisse's letter of apology, indicating that he did in fact spit at the Senegalese international. Jonny Evans (left) and Papiss Cisse clash after an unsavoury incident on Wednesday night . Manchester United defender Jonny Evans appeared to launch spit in the direction of the floored Cisse . Newcastle striker Cisse subsequently retaliated and appeared to aim spit of his own back at the United man . The FA are waiting for referee Anthony Taylor's report. As he missed the incident between Jonny Evans and Pappis Cisse, it is unlikely the it will be included in his report - meaning the FA can retrospectively punish the pair. Hull striker George Boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, the FA have issued new guidelines to move in line with new FIFA guidelines meaning Evans and Cisse could now be banned for six games. Evans' statement on Manchester United's official website read: 'Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night's match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. 'I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. 'It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.' However, while Cisse has said sorry to his team-mates, fans, and even Evans, he said his spit back in the Northern Irishman's direction was a reaction. 'I have apologies to make to a lot of people today,' Cisse said. 'Firstly to my teammates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny. 'I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be positive a role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down. 'I hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry. Perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake, not copy it.' Cisse has apologised for Evans after reacting while the Man United defender has denied all allegations . The pair tangled during the first half of the Premier League clash and appeared to aim kicks at each other before the situation turned even more unsavoury. The referee missed the incident meaning the FA, who are waiting for Anthony Taylor's report, can ban the pair retrospectively for six games each. Last season Hull City striker George Boyd was banned for three matches after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, the FA upped the punishment for spitting to six games to come in line with new FIFA guidelines, which state that any player 'dismissed from the Field of Play for spitting at an opponent or any other person' will be suspended 'following the match in which he was sent off until such time as his Club has completed its next six matches in approved Competitions.' If found guilty, Cisse will be banned for an extra game because of a previous violent conduct ban for elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman. Afterwards, Van Gaal defended Evans. 'I did not see that (incident) from the bench, but I cannot imagine he would do that,' said the Dutchman. If found guilty, Papiss Cisse will be banned for an extra game because of a previous violent conduct ban . Cisse elbowed Everton defender Seamus Coleman during Newcastle's 3-2 victory in December . Newcastle head coach John Carver said: 'You can't do it can you? It's one of the worst things in football. 'But I can't comment on it, I just know there was a fracas on the halfway line and I need to have a look at it.' Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, covering the match as a pundit for BT Sport, slammed Cisse while suggesting Evans wasn't a guilty party. 'I think Jonny is spitting on the floor. I know Jonny, he's not that type of person,' he said. 'If he wants to do that then it's not hard to miss, is it? He's only stood a yard away from him. What Cisse does afterwards is unforgivable.'

"Andrea Barzagli has rejected recent criticism aimed at Italy coach Antonio Conte for including two foreign-born players in his squad to face Bulgaria and England. The Juventus centre-back defended his manager, who has come under fire from Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini among others for his choice to select Eder and Franco Vazquez, who are both Brazilian-born and Argentinian-born respectively. Speaking in a press conference ahead of Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria, Barzagli was keen to welcome the duo to the squad.

'There are rules, if they can be called up it's right that they have been because that means they are doing well in the league. 'I don't see why there should be debate, other nations have them, too. If they are good, if they can give us a hand, they're welcome in the national team.'

'I can't see myself still in Azzurro [the Italy squad] after the Euros, primarily because I'll be over 35. I'm not a player like [Gianluigi] Buffon or [Andrea] Pirlo who can keep going until 40.

"A horrified father has spoken out after he saw a video of his ex-girlfriend hitting his two-year-old daughter in footage shared online last week. Charlie Foster III of Ballston Spa, New York said he burst into tears as he watched the upsetting video posted onto Facebook involving his daughter Shelby Foster. 'I immediately started crying,' he told WFLA. 'I felt like I needed to do something.' The footage that was shared on  Monday shows his former girlfriend Darci Ives and her boyfriend Louis Yager, who live together in Tampa, chastising and hitting Yager's two children and Shelby. Scroll down for video . A horrified father spoke of the moment he watched the video of his ex-girlfriend hitting his two-year-old daughter in footage that surfaced last week (above Charlie Foster III with his daughter Shelby Foster) Foster said he immediately burst into tears when he saw the scene of his two-year-old daughter being hit . The footage  posted onto Facebook shows Darci Ives and her boyfriend Louis Yager, who live together in Tampa, Florida, chastising and hitting his two children and Shelby . From slapping the three preschool-aged children to shoving a dirty broom in one of their faces, Foster found it all hard to watch. After seeing the scene of his daughter being slapped in the face by Ives, he contacted Florida's child abuse hotline and finally got through after three attempts, according to WFLA. He also contacted Tampa police. Ives and Yager are currently under investigation by police for possible child abuse. Ives' sister reportedly shot the disturbing footage and a friend made one compilation of the several videos that show the children with Ives and Yager. During the video, Ives is seen shouting 'no, I don't want to fight with you, I gotta get Crystal to bed' before smacking and telling a child 'here's something to cry about'. In another scene she is seen cleaning the kitchen floor before shoving a broom in the face of a crying child seated in a highchair. It appears her sister who is allegedly filming is heard saying 'you shouldn't put that in her face'. Yager is seen shouting 'be quiet right now' to one of the children before it appears he is hitting the baby seated in the highchair on the head while saying 'hello, be quiet'.

Ives and Yager, following the seizure of their children, said they hoped to get their children back. Relatives and friends have said Ives and Yager met only a few months ago before she decided to move from New York and into a trailer park with him near Ybor City in Tampa. Ives and Yager are currently under investigation by police for possible child abuse (Ives pictured with Shelby  above) and the children have been taken into custody by CPS . Relatives and friends have said Ives and Yager met only a few months ago before she decided to move into a trailer park with him near Ybor City in Tampa . Natosha Wilkins of Ballston Spa, New York was one of many people who shared the video in an effort to get justice served against Yager and Ives. On Wednesday she wrote on Facebook expressing that she was happy the children are now safe. Wilkins wrote: 'Even though the babies are safe, and under CPS care I'm still busting my ass off for them. & I won't stop til they have a loving home and the right proper care! You three beautiful babies deserve more then what you have gotten.' In previous reports, the Hillsborough State Attorney's office did not press child abuse charges after the video surfaced, but said that authorities were reviewing new evidence that had surfaced on Monday. Foster, who is currently raising money to pay for legal and travel fees so that he can bring Shelby to New York, said he has not been able to reach his daughter since she was placed into shelter care. 'I would tell her that I love her. I would tell her that I miss her and I want her home,' Foster told WFLA. 'I just want her to know that daddy's fighting for her.' Foster is currently raising money to pay for legal and travel fees so that he can bring Shelby to live with him in New York with his fiancee and close to her grandparents . Shelby's father said he wants to tell her that he loves her and that 'daddy is fighting for her' In happier times, Shelby pictured with both of her parents, Foster and Ives . Currently living with his fiancee, Foster said that Ives had been moving around to stop him from having contact with Shelby. On his GoFundMe page he wrote that he would do anything to bring his daughter back home to 'live with her family who loves and cares for her'. He wrote: 'The videos have gone viral with the help and support of all the caring people on Facebook and I can't thank you enough for helping her get out of her mother's custody. 'But I still need help paying for the expenses to travel to Florida and get her out of foster care. And to pay for an attorney to make sure her mother gets the maximum punishment.' He added: 'If I can raise the money to get down there and [get] a great attorney, we will be one step closer to bringing Shelby back home with the family she deserves.' On a Facebook page titled A Safe Haven For Shelby, it appears Foster posted a message on Thursday saying that people had been concerned about Yager's two children, Chris and Crystal, including himself. Natosha Wilkins, who had posted the video earlier this week to get the attention of police and CPS, said she is happy the children are in the care of CPS but that the fight will not stop . On Thursday, a Facebook page called A Safe Haven for Shelby wrote that Yager's kids, Chris and Crystal, are in a better place as many are concerned for them . The post said that the children's mother is not in the picture and that they will also not be placed with her. He wrote: 'I know everyone including myself is very concerned about Chris and Crystal. I know the kids and unfortunately the parents. 'All I can say is Mom is not in the picture, nor will she have them placed with her. I can tell you from being on the good side of foster care that none including family members are ever told the whereabouts of the foster placement. 'None of us can get information because we have no direct correlation to the case. Even if we did, limited information is given. 'I am concerned and will continue to update if I get any info on these beautiful babies. Right now they are in a better place. 'They do have family, they do have someone fighting to get them, whether or not CPI decides that the family is the best placement for them will be decided by evaluation. This is the process in these cases. I promise to keep you all informed.' The video featuring Ives and Yagers' unsettling parenting behavior is currently under criminal investigation by Tampa Police and the Department of Children and Families Child Protection.","Charlie Foster III of Ballston Spa, New York said he burst into tears when he watched the disturbing video that was shared on Monday .

"Carlos Tevez has become the latest footballer to try his hand into the fashion world with the launch of his new headwear. The Juventus striker uploaded an Instagram post to his account on Tuesday posing in his own customised snapback hat. In what appears to be a new range of the 31-year-old, the Argentine's hat is emblazoned with 'TVZ 32' across the front - in an abbreviation of his surname and the number of his jerseys worn at West Ham, Manchester United and their 'noisy neighbours' City. Carlos Tevez has posted an Instagram picture on Tuesday showing off his customised snapback . Manchester City's infamous 'Welcome to Manchester' poster (pictured) appears to be referenced on the hat . Tevez's time at City also seems to be referenced along the peak of the hat - with the Etihad outfit's infamous 'Welcome to Manchester' poster depicted in white upon the black background. While the hat may not be easy on the eye to some, the same couldn't be said for Tevez's free-kick in their 1-1 draw at Roma on Monday night. The forward's beautifully-curled effort gave Juve the lead at their Serie A titles rivals in the second half. Speaking after the match, Tevez admitted he had learned how to become a dead-ball specialist from club team-mate Andrea Pirlo. 'I copied [Andrea] Pirlo,' he told the Gazetta dello Sport. 'I watch him every day in training and tried to copy him. 'But when he returns, he will take them again. He is a specialist and I have to respect that.' Tevez gave Juventus the lead with a sublime free kick after Roma were reduced to 10 men on Monday night .

It was not enough to win the match, though, as Seydou Keita headed Roma level with 12 minutes to play, earning a share of the spoils between Serie A's top two. 'We are very angry,' Tevez added. 'In the last 20 minutes we lost a game in which we had done very well. 'The team showed great character, but after the goal, when it was 11 against 10, we cannot give away such an important game.' Juve, aiming for a fourth consecutive title, are nine points clear at the summit with 13 games remaining.

The former Manchester United midfielder was alongside his wife Victoria at Wellington Arch, where he hosted a lavish dinner party at a pop-up bar. The venue, also called 'Haig Club', has been set up for one week to celebrate the launch of Beckham's whisky, and is styled to emulate the original 1920s Haig Club 'Clubman Series' adverts.

"Manor have been summoned to the stewards to explain why they missed qualifying for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. Despite strenuous efforts this week, Manor failed to make it out on track at Melbourne's Albert Park at any stage over the course of the past two days. It resulted in drivers Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi, along with the team's mechanics, looking on from the garage as qualifying unfolded. Will Stevens watches on from the garage after Manor failed to make it out on to the track for qualifying . Mechanics from Manor work on their car in the garage ahead of today's qualifying session . Sporting director Graeme Lowdon confirmed the team had made enormous strides since encountering numerous issues on Friday, but ultimately had to concede defeat in their bid to take part. The South Yorkshire-based marque only emerged from administration three weeks ago after being saved by energy entrepreneur Stephen Fitzpatrick. Prior to that Manor were on the brink of selling their assets via an auction, resulting in them being forced to wipe all the hard drives of their computers, so losing valuable data to aid their return. Attempting to rebuild their systems from the ground up has proven time consuming and difficult, and in the end too big a hurdle to overcome, leaving them now to focus on the next race in Malaysia. Lewis Hamilton will start tomorrow's race from pole after qualifying at the front of the pack . The FIA, however, appear far from impressed as a team representative has met with the race stewards, providing 'a written statement explaining why the team did not participate in qualifying... after receiving a letter from the FIA on the 20th February'. No details have yet emerged as to the contents of the letter referred to by the FIA, or whether the team face any potential sanction. Team principal John Booth, explaining Manor's position prior to the request from the stewards, said: 'We always expected things to be this difficult. We knew there was only a slim chance of making qualifying when we set off. 'These modern Formula One cars are incredibly complex things, and we have had three weeks to design and build the car in accordance with the 2015 regulations. 'We've had no time to fix the racks and electronics, and get all the infrastructure built that was required.'","Manor have failed to make it out on track at Melbourne over the weekend .

"Napoli failed to close the gap on Serie A leaders Juventus after surrendering a two-goal lead against Inter Milan at the Stadio San Paolo on Sunday night. Marek Hamsik headed in Henrique's cross six minutes after the interval, before Gonzalo Higuain doubled Napoli's advantage shortly after the hour mark with a stunning curled strike into the far top corner from 25 yards - putting the hosts firmly in the ascendancy before the late drama. It was Argentina forward Higuain's first league goal since a double against Genoa on January 26, although he has scored an impressive 13 goals in 25 league appearances this season.

However, the match turned on its head 18 minutes from time when the visitors pulled a goal back. Rodrigo Palacio fired home from close range after a series of close-range shots were charged down. And then after a sustained period of pressure from Roberto Mancini's men, Inter levelled with just three minutes remaining. Mauro Icardi was clearly not feeling the pressure as his exquisite chipped penalty found the middle of the goal, after Henrique was shown a second yellow card for pulling down Palacio in the area. Napoli now find themselves 12 points off the leaders Juventus - having played a game more too - while Inter remain firmly poised in mid-table with 36 points from their 26 games to date in Serie A.

"David Coulthard has questioned Lewis Hamilton’s focus on the eve of the new Formula One campaign. Hamilton is the favourite to defend his championship with Mercedes expected to hold a clear advantage over the rest of the field when the season gets underway in Melbourne in the early hours of Sunday morning. The 30-year-old Briton has brushed shoulders with a host of A-List celebrities during the off-season as he continues to expand his profile outside of the sport. Lewis Hamilton is pictured on St Kilda beach on Thursday as he prepares to defend his Formula One title . The Briton faced the media in the first pre-race press conference of the year ahead of the Australian GP . He is also close to signing a new deal with Mercedes which will see him earn a considerable amount more than the current £20million-a-year contract he signed after leaving McLaren in 2012. Meanwhile, his private life has also been the subject of much discussion following the break-up of his relationship with long-term girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, the American popstar who was in Abu Dhabi to celebrate his second world championship last year. ‘Lewis appears to be going through a transition in his off-track life,’ said Coulthard, a 13-time race winner. ‘I see he is negotiating his own contract, doing music in the future and has split up with Nicole, and all of these things have an influence on your life which may be a positive or negative. ‘It will be interesting to see now that he has won two world titles, is a wealthy champion, and got lots of opportunities, whether the absolute focus is still on the job.’ Hamilton signs autographs for fans at the Albert Park Circuit. He starts the season as championship favourite . David Coulthard, pictured on Thursday, believes Nico Rosberg will return stronger this season . Rosberg will renew his title battle with Hamilton . Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg are set to go toe-to-toe for the world championship once more after the dominant Mercedes pair won 16 of the 19 races last season during a frenetic campaign. Hamilton clinched the title in dramatic circumstances at the season finale in Abu Dhabi with his 11th victory of the year. But Coulthard expects the German, who tasted victory just once after his collision with Hamilton at the Belgian Grand Prix in August, to return stronger this term. ‘Nico now has the experience of battling for a world championship,' added Coulthard. 'He went into last year with a good car, everything was going great, then he had the collision in Spa, his team told him he was a bad boy, and he was getting booed by the fans. 'There were so many first-life experiences for him and a lot of things he had to go through. 'I think he will be stronger. He is settled in his life, he is married and he has got a baby coming later in the year.’ The F1 season kicks off with the Australian GP on Sunday 15 March.

"April will be welcomed in with rain and heavy winds battering most of the country this week. And those preparing themselves for a sunny Easter may be sorely disappointed as the clouds are not expected to lift by next weekend. There was chaos in parts of the UK today with gale-force winds causing trees to fall on tracks and trains to be severely delayed in the West Country. Scroll down for video . Brave: A daring person scrambles over slippery rocks to face an almighty wave on the beach at Porthcawl in south Wales . Stranded: A member of the public walks in between two crashing waves in Lyme Regis, west Dorset, trying to take a photograph . Wet: The unsettled weather is expected to last through the Bank Holiday weekend. Pictured, waves batter the seafront in Southsea, Hampshire . Windswept: A volunteer struggles to open a bin bag due to the strong winds during a clean up of Southsea beach . Workmen were called to clear the blockage on the railway track between Exeter in Devon and Taunton in Somerset. Elsewhere in Devon, gale-force winds also caused ferry services in Torbay to be cancelled over safety concerns for passengers. The conditions saw the school holidays get off to a gloomy start, and forecasters said the unsettled weather will continue for much of the week. The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for ice across the North West of England and Scotland for today and tomorrow. And a League Two football match between Bury and Southend United was called off after just six minutes on Saturday after rain soaked the pitch. Meanwhile 71mph gales struck Scotland - with temperatures in Finnart, near Gare Loch, plummeting to -1C (30.2F) yesterday.

But Coningsby in Lincolnshire saw 16C (60.8F) yesterday, while the UK high today was Marham in Norfolk was 14C (57.2F). Temperatures across Britain this week are expected to average between 10C (50F) and 12C (53.6F) with high winds and hail anticipated on Tuesday. Spirits may lift for the South on Wednesday with some sun expected - but the clouds will return again by Thursday, when rain is also expected to fall. And with travel woe predicted on the roads and railways as 16 million people take to their cars, it could make for a miserable holiday getaway. At the same time last year, temperatures soared to 20C (60F) in some parts of the South East. Charlie Powell, a forecaster for the Met Office told the Daily Mail: ‘Through the week there will be a general improvement. Soggy: Bury's match against Southend United in League Two at Gigg Lane was abandoned yesterday because of a waterlogged pitch . Working hard: A groundsman tries to dry the pitch at Bury, but it was deemed unplayable by the referee and called off six minutes after kick-off . Grim weather: A group of tourists huddle up together during a chilly punting trip on the River Cam in Cambridge today . ‘It looks like the wind will clear by the Easter weekend. Sunshine I would be less confident about. 'But we’ve got unsettled weather to come over the next few days.’ Mr Powell added: ‘Last April, it was a nice first week on the whole. Across some parts of the south east it got to 20C - so pretty warm.’ And the dreary weather will not be the only dampener on the Easter weekend. Trains over the Easter period will be severely disrupted with work planned between London and Watford and the route between Paddington and Didcot. Routes between London and the west Midlands as well as Penrith and Preston will also be affected.","Forecasters warn unsettled weather will continue for much of the week, with hail expected on Tuesday .

"Oliver Downes has avoided jail after admitting making and possessing indecent images of children . A Birmingham grammar school teacher has avoided jail after admitting making indecent images of children. Oliver Downes was suspended from Bishop Vesey Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield, after police began an investigation into the allegations  last year. The 40-year-old, who had been teaching and coaching rugby for 13 years, resigned shortly after in July. A spokesman for the prestigious school, whose former pupils include TV presenter Cat Deeley, said that none of their pupils had been involved in the offences. Downes appeared at Birmingham Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to nine counts of making indecent images of children and nine counts of possessing indecent images of children. He had also admitted production of a Class B drug, cannabis. In a statement after the court case, a Bishop Vesey spokesman said: 'The school has co-operated fully with the police. 'The offences relate to the former teacher's behaviour outside of school and there is no evidence to suggest any child from the school was involved in any way. 'The member of staff was suspended and resigned on 18 July with immediate effect.' Downes received a two-year jail sentence, suspended for two years, and was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work in the community. Downes was suspended from Bishop Vesey Grammar School (pictured) in Sutton Coldfield after police began an investigation last year . He was also ordered to attend a sex offenders' work programme for 50 hours and was placed on a two-year supervision order. Bishop Vesey is one of the oldest schools in the West Midlands, founded in the 16th century. Today it caters for more than 900 pupils and has almost 100 full and part-time members of staff. Downes, an avid football fan, had joined the school in 2001, having graduated from university in 1998. He had previously been a student at King Edward VI School in Aston. On his Facebook site, Downes describes himself as single and as 'chilled, different, fun, intense, work that out.'

Salah was used as a bargaining tool for Juan Cuadrado to go in the opposite direction for £23.3m, rising to £27m with bonuses, but has been the more devastating of the two for their new clubs. 'Are you listening, Jose?' Mourinho allowed Mohamed Salah to leave Chelsea on loan to Fiorentina . The front pages of Italian newspapers were dominated by Salah after his two goals against Juventus . Mohamed Salah . 7 games . 6 goals . Juan Cuadrado . 5 games . 0 goals . Salah did not suit Jose Mourinho's style of play and made just two starts in 2014-15. He averaged nine minutes per game between August and January, and the arrival of Cuadrado saw him further kicked to the curb. Mourinho and Salah agreed it was best he get first-team opportunities elsewhere, and Fiorentina's faith has been rewarded . Against Juventus he sent a message to Chelsea by starting a run from his own half in a lethal counter-attack. He outpaced Simone Padoin before beating goalkeeper Marco Storari in the top left corner to make it 1-0 in the 11th minute. Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba were on the same wavelength when they tweeted Salah is 'on fire' and the Egyptian, four years younger than Cuadrado, has plenty of time to improve.

Salah (right) spent most of his time at Chelsea on the substitutes' bench under manager Jose Mourinho . BASLE: 67 appearances, 13 goals. CHELSEA: 19 appearances, two goals. FIORENTINA: Seven appearances, six goals. EGYPT: 35 appearances, 20 goals. On his arrival, Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella announced Salah would have to 'adapt to our football' and that 'this is a league that's different from the Swiss and the English'. Louis van Gaal admitted it could take a year for Manchester United's signings to develop, but no such time frame has been required for Salah. Any suggestion he could not perform against Barclays Premier League teams was dismissed on March 1 when he punished Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League with a quick-witted one-two. And three days later he scored the winner against Inter Milan at the San Siro to earn Fiorentina's first win in that fixture since May 2000. All this has helped Fiorentina stretch their unbeaten run to 13 games as the man behind Hazard, Willian, Oscar and Cuadrado in the pecking order gets put to good use elsewhere.

"Kurt Zouma has praised Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho's role in his rapid development that has seen the Frenchman become a contender at centre back for both his club and country. The 20-year-old defender has made 20 appearances in his first season at Stamford Bridge, and Mourinho's guidance has seen him keep established starter Gary Cahill out of the side at times. Zouma's form earned a France call-up for the current international break, and he could even earn his first cap in their friendly against Denmark on Sunday night. Kurt Zouma has praised Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho's role in his rapid development with the Blues . Zouma, seen here attempting to tackle Blaise Matuidi, has been called up to the France squad recently . Zouma trains with his French team-mates ahead of their game against Denmark on Sunday evening . Zouma said that Mourinho puts a lot of pressure on his players, but he seems to be thriving under it . And Chelsea's breakthrough star credits his impressive showings that have led him to this point in his career to the manager who signed him for £12million from St Etienne last January. When asked what he had learnt under Mourinho, Zouma said: 'To hate defeat. When you lose it's out of bounds to continue as normal in the evening. When you play for Chelsea you must not accept losing. 'Mourinho puts pressure on all his players. He is very demanding and wants perfection. 'In defence, he asks me to move tactically and to be well placed to listen to John (Terry) and Gary Cahill around me. Initially, I was obsessed with the ball and did not watch players behind me enough, but it's something I've been working on.' Gary Cahill joins Zouma in celebrating a goal, and the Frenchman has been told to stick close to Cahill . Mourinho has told Zouma to work closely to Cahill and John Terry in order to listen and learn from them . Mourinho has asked Zouma to 'move tactically' and to focus on the runs players make rather than just the ball . Zouma played in midfield for Chelsea against Tottenham Hotspur in the Capital One Cup final and was then deployed there again by Mourinho against West Ham United and Paris Saint-Germain. While Zouma was surprised to play there, he did so under specific instructions. 'In midfield, it's different,' he said. 'He (Mourinho) asks me to use my power and to stay in place to help the defence.' Although the young defender has found a place in Didier Deschamps' squad for the current set of fixtures, he does not yet see himself as a potential contender for Euro 2016, which the French are set to host. The 20-year-old centre back started against Tottenham in midfield in the Capital One Cup final this month . Zouma impressed in midfield and was selected there again for Chelsea's trip to face West Ham the next week . Juan Cuadrado, Zouma, Loic Remy and Eden Hazard celebrate with the Capital One Cup on March 1 . 'Honestly, I think I have to play a little more to be worthy of a place,' he said in an interview with L'Equipe. 'I'll work hard. They (the other centre backs) are really strong and they have the experience. But when you have a goal, you should not look at who is in front of you, you should fight. That is all.'

"This is the massive Mexican, red rump tarantula discovered wandering around a football pitch in Maesteg, South Wales by a concerned member of the public. Bridgend council, which is now trying to track down the tarantula's owner, was alerted after the spider - which is not generally harmful to humans - was spotted by a passer-by at local Garth Park ball court. Local authority worker Dave Edwards scooped the arachnid up into a black bag before calling wildlife expert and TV personality Dr Rhys Jones, from Cardiff University, for advice. Dr Rhys Jones, from Cardiff University, best known as the star of the BBC One Wales series Rhys Jones's Wildlife Patrol holds the lost tarantula, showing how safe it is . Dr Jones, best known as the star of the BBC One series Rhys Jones's Wildlife Patrol, said: 'It is unlikely that the spider would have travelled from distance, given the cold spring temperatures and the proximity of local houses. 'The surrounding habitat offered little interest or cover for that species of spider, given that it mainly consists of large open fields which are patrolled by many aerial predators, including gulls and crows. 'These birds would have easily spotted this tropical spider and, given half a chance, would have eaten her. 'All things considered, the spider had a very lucky escape before a bird or cat killed it.' The Mexican red rump, or B. vagans in Latin, was made famous in Jack Arnold's 1955 sci-fi movie Tarantula, where an ill-advised scientific experiment leads to a giant arachnid breaking out of captivity and terrorizing the Arizona desert. Luckily for the population of Bridgend County Borough, however, the creature is not aggressive, and is currently being looked after by Dr Jones at Cardiff University. 'The red rump tarantula does not present a significant health risk to the general public. In the rare case of the spider biting, the symptoms would be similar to that of a mild bee sting. 'I'm happy to report that no one was unnecessarily frightened by the appearance of this spider on the loose. 'While the spider is now secure and recovering from its ordeal, anyone with nformation relating to this incident should either contact the local authority or the police on 101.' Councillor Phil White, Cabinet Member for Communities, added: 'It's not every day that you spot an exotic pet such as this outside of its home environment, so we are appealing for the owner to get in touch as soon as possible.

"Lucas Silva has conceded a loan away from Real Madrid could enhance his long-term prospects at the Bernabeu amid reports he will make a move to Porto. The Brazilian has appeared just seven times for Real since his January transfer from Belo Horizonte's Cruzeiro but believes he can stake a claim for a regular place in Carlo Ancelotti's side. However, with just four starts in a possible 19 matches since his debut in the Champions League against Schalke on February 18, regular football elsewhere could be a blessing in disguise for the 22-year-old - and if reports are to be believed Porto are in the box seat. Lucas Silva (right) says a loan move from Real Madrid could be a good option as he seeks game time . The Brazilian 22-year-old moved to the Bernabeu in January but has made just seven appearances . 'I was astonished with the news about a potential loan move to Porto. I have not heard anything about it,' Lucas Silva told Brazilian publication Globo Esporte. 'I have a contract with Real Madrid and I want to fulfil it. I have already had opportunities and I think I have the ability to be in the team and to play. 'But a loan move could be a good option.' Lucas Silva followed the Schalke match by starting in February 22's 2-0 league win over Elche and the March 1 draw with Villarreal. He then had to wait a fortnight to make Ancelotti's XI against Levante. Lucas Silva (left) say he is committed to fulfilling his contract at Real Madrid but is tipped to go to Porto .

Now, with Easter just a few days away, a California couple has been shocked by the ‘miraculous’ appearance of Jesus Christ... on their pine dining table.

In October, John Cranfield, 24, who lives in Manchester, inserted a slice of wholemeal bread into the toaster and was baffled when it popped out with the face of Jesus Christ. Mr Cranfield, a Catholic, said he was sure it is a message from God, adding: ‘As a strong Christian I believe that this was no mistake, I believe that God himself had sent it to me to prove that he exists and that I should not give up my faith.’ Over the years, images of Christ have also appeared on crisps, pancakes, banana peel, pizza and ice cream.

"As Chris Smalling continues his efforts to convince Louis van Gaal he is worth another contract at Manchester United, he is safe in the knowledge Roy Hodgson has always admired his qualities, ever since a chance first encounter. Hodgson signed Smalling from non-league Maidstone United, seven years ago, soon after Les Reed, Fulham's director of football, had invited the 18-year-old centre-half along to a trial at the club's training ground in Surrey. 'He was watching by chance and he pulled me into his office and it all started from there,' said Smalling. 'I can't remember the whole conversation, it's a bit of a blur, but Roy was very encouraging. Chris Smalling (centre) in action during an England training session at St Georges Park . Smalling is thankful for Hodgson and is delighted they can rekindle their relationship at England . 'He mentioned in conversation that he'd played for Maidstone. It was quite surreal. I didn't know many other people who had played for Maidstone. 'I came back for a week to train with the reserves, and was offered a contract a month or so later. He's the one who really got it started for me and it's nice to rekindle that with England. I hope my performances for my club help him to keep selecting me.' Hodgson, who played for Maidstone in the early 70s, convinced Smalling he had a career in professional football, although the youngster decided to complete his A-levels first. The defender has become a key player for Manchester United this season alongside Phil Jones . There were university places on offer to study financial economics at Leicester or Loughborough if he secured three Bs in his exams, which he did. 'I was planning to go to university but a month or two before my exams I was offered trials by Fulham and Middlesbrough,' said Smalling. 'I had nothing to lose and gave it my all. 'I'd been at Millwall until I was about 15. It was quite far to travel and I was missing some sessions, so I wasn't really developing, and then I went to Maidstone.' Hodgson signed Smalling when he was Fulham boss from non-league side Maidstone United . His education did little to impress Van Gaal, earlier this season, when the Manchester United boss branded Smalling 'stupid' for a red card, during the first half of the derby against City. 'I was foolish, and it was a rush of blood,' said Smalling. 'You learn more from yourself than from what managers and fans say. It's something I've not done too often and hopefully it won't happen again. I've learnt not to get caught up in these situations. I try not to clock up too many cards, but that was a moment of madness.' The same could be said for his decision to attend a fancy dress party last year in a Jager-bomber costume, with an Arabian headscarf, shades, a flak-jacket and bottles of Jagermeister and Red Bull strapped to his body. After being close to going to university, Smalling is now an England international and trophy winner . 'There's always people out there that are trying to pick you up, and as a role model for young players you have to make sure you're on the ball,' he said. 'That's something you only learn as you get older. 'It's more a case of common sense really, but there are older players there if you do need some advice. It was one of those things. There are a lot of things that happen that sometimes get blown up. In general that's rare for me.' Niggling injuries have proved more disruptive since he left Fulham for Old Trafford in 2010, but he is back in the team and has delivered some impressive performances as Van Gaal's United started to click. Smalling of England speaks to the media during the England press conference at The Grove Hotel . He was excellent in the win at Liverpool, frustrating Mario Balotelli in the process, and was looking forward to another duel with the striker in Turin until he discovered Balotelli has been omitted from the squad for the friendly against England. 'If you're doing your job and not giving the striker much of a chance he'll probably get angry, and Balotelli is someone who can lose his temper very quickly,' said Smalling. 'If I'm shutting down the striker, I'm happy to see them get frustrated. 'I thought it could be round two on Tuesday, but I've seen he's not in the squad so we'll have to wait for that.' The defender enjoyed winding up Mario Balotelli and was disappointed to not see him in Italy's squad . Smalling's good form offered encouragement to those who believe the 25-year-old may yet prove to be a long-term successor to Rio Ferdinand. 'I've been able to clock up a run of games in the past few months,' he said. 'The manager has shown a lot of faith in me and I've been able to stay fit. It' s nice to get a good run, it helps you become more confident and to put your personality on the game. 'Rio was a defender I really admired for the way he put his character and personality onto the pitch. He's not just your everyday defender. You can see his character in the way he wants to play football. That's something young players can pick up on. Rio Ferdinand was a major influence on Smalling and he admired the way that he played the game . 'When I joined it was a case of playing with him for a good few years and picking up a lot of points. Eventually when he did move on I felt I was ready and it was an opportunity for me to show myself. 'When you have the shirt, everyone else is fighting it out and trying to push you out of the way. When that time comes you need to make sure you're in a good run of form so the manager feels you are the one who should step in.' The process has been complicated since by injuries, managerial changes at Old Trafford, his own versatility and Van Gaal's habit of switching between three and four at the back. With Champions League qualification close to being secured, the defender can look forward to Europe . 'I've not had too many different managers and this is my first foreign coach,' said Smalling. 'He's really worked hard on the training field right from the double sessions in pre-season. We've had the tactics, and quite a lot of meetings in terms of the vision he wants. 'He wants more from the centre-halves on the ball, rather than taking the easy option and passing to the full-back when the room is too narrow that they can't really do much with the ball. 'The manager does stress why pass it to him when you've got no-one marking you. I am enjoying that responsibility. Sir Alex wanted us to play out, but there's more emphasis on that now. Louis van Gaal (left) and Sir Alex Ferguson have very different styles of management says Smalling . 'Growing up, first of all you're a defender but we have more possession than a lot of teams and we have to be a bit more like the midfield and start moves.' Smalling's contract expires next year. As someone who had the chance to study financial economics, you might think he would be all over the details, but he is in no rush. 'It's not something I really want to focus on,' he said. 'It's not really come into my head. I'm enjoying it at United. I'm focusing on the rest of the season. I'm happy as ever because I'm playing and hopefully I can keep contributing.'","Chris Smalling was signed by Roy Hodgson when he was Fulham boss and the defender was playing for non-league side Maidstone United .

"Chris Borland is walking away from the NFL after his rookie season because of concerns about the long-term effects of head trauma. The 24-year-old linebacker told the San Francisco 49ers on Friday and made the announcement on ESPN's Outside the Lines. After consulting with eminent concussion reserachers and his family, Borland decided to call it quits on a promising NFL career. 'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' Borland told the show. 'From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk.' Former Wisconsin Badger Borland tackles Alfred Morris during his highly promising rookie year . 'I just thought to myself, ""What am I doing? Is this how I'm going to live my adult life, banging my head, especially with what I've learned and knew about the dangers?'"" Borland has had two concussions in his life; one playing soccer in eighth grade and the next while playing football at high school. He said he took a head shot in training camp last season and opted to play through it. Borland has retired from the NFL after one year . Borland's year in San Francisco yielded 107 tackles, two interceptions and was awarded NFC Defensive Player of the Week and received a vote for Defensive Rookie of the Year. His announcement is a further blow to the 49ers, who are in a state of flux since former head coach Jim Harbaugh left the Bay Area. Fellow linebacker Patrick Willis also took the decision to retire after eight years in the NFL, to leave the 49ers in strife in a previous position of strength. Borland and Willis join 27-year-old Jason Worilds, who quit the Pittsburgh Steelers after five years in the NFL, and Jake Locker, 26, who also announced his decision to turn his back on the game. Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice president of health and safety policy, released in a statement. 'We respect Chris Borland's decision and wish him all the best. Playing any sport is a personal decision. 'By any measure, football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes, safer tackling techniques at all levels of football, and better equipment, protocols and medical care for players. 'Concussions in NFL games were down 25 percent last year, continuing a three-year downward trend. We continue to make significant investments in independent research to advance the science and understanding of these issues. We are seeing a growing culture of safety. Everyone involved in the game knows that there is more work to do and player safety will continue to be our top priority.' Borland's announcement took the 49ers by surprise. 'While unexpected, we certainly respect Chris' decision, general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. 'From speaking with Chris, it was evident that he had put a great deal of thought into this decision. He was a consummate professional from day one and a very well respected member of our team and community. Chris is a determined young man that overcame long odds in his journey to the NFL and we are confident he will use the same approach to become very successful in his future endeavors. We will always consider him a 49er and wish him all the best.'","Borland spoke with concussion experts and family members before making the decision .

Marvin Lewis made it a priority to bring Michael Johnson back to Cincinnati to bolster their pass rush . But his productivity was hindered by injuries, with just four sacks in 14 games. Consequently, he joined Josh McCown and Anthony Collis on general manager Jason Licht's unwanted list. The move frees up $2m cap space. 'I'm thankful for the Buccaneers giving me an opportunity to come down there and learn,' Johnson said on a conference call. 'I'm going to always cherish all of the memories - the highs and the lows. You can't appreciate the highs without the lows.' 'This last year was a character-building year. I don't count it as a bad year. So I come back to Cincinnati with a different mindset and a different outlook on things.'

He had a few guys in mind but none of them could take the fight or would agree to it. Britain's Luke Barnatt found the replacement he was looking for after his fight with Clint Hester was scrapped . Barnatt will be facing Filipino-American fighter Mark Munoz in the UFC's maiden event in the Philippines . 'I said, 'Why don't you give me Mark Munoz and let me fight in the Philippines?' 'Then Joe called back and said he'd made about 500 phone calls and that he couldn't find anyone, so your wish is my command – you're fighting Mark in the Philippines. 'I went from being very down, to being very happy, and now I have 10 weeks to prepare for the fight.' Barnatt is looking to bounce back from two frustrating back to back losses, both of which the middleweight feels he would have won, were it not for poor judging decisions. Mark Munoz, meanwhile, who recently fell short of the UFC's top 15 middleweight rankings, is a veteran of the sport and will present a dangerous challenge on the ground for Barnatt. 'Obviously I have to pay a bit more attention to my wrestling now' said Barnatt. 'Mark is a very, very good wrestler. There will be a bit more of a focus on, but I am going to implement my own game plan.' Munoz (front) fought in UFC 184 but was forced into submission by Brazilian fighter Roan Carneiro (rear) Carneiro celebrates his win over Munoz in their middleweight bout during the UFC 184 event at Staples Cente . The bout will feature on the UFC Fight Night: Edgar vs. Faber fight card, the UFC's first event ever to take place in the Philippines. 'Six years ago I was in Thailand.' Barnatt continued. 'I lived there for 7 months and I always wanted to go to the Philippines, so I'm super excited. I'm going to go out there about 10 days before to get acclimatized. The funny thing is, Mark trains about 3 hours away from me in California so we will both be going all that way. We will probably leave on the same flight to get out there!' When it comes to trash talk, we can expect to witness none of that in the lead up to this bout. 'I know Mark' said Barnatt. 'He's pound for pound the nicest guy in the world. But this will probably be Mark's last fight in the UFC. He's wanted to fight in the Philippines for so long so it's great that he's able to do that, but I think this will be the last fight for him. 'It's a fantastic opportunity that the UFC has given me, to allow me to be the one to retire Mark Munoz.' Munoz was on the losing end against Carneiro, but he'll be hoping for a comeback against Barnatt on May 16 .","The pair will meet at UFC Fight Night: Edgar vs. Faber on May 16 .

"Reggie Bush will head back to his native California to fill the Frank Gore-sized hole in the 49ers backfield. The 30-year-old was cut by Detroit after two mixed years; the first inspired, the second injury-hit. ESPN first reported the deal after Bush opted not to join the New England Patriots. Concerns about fitness will plague the running back but when healthy he adds a threat on the ground and in the air. Reggie Bush trains with the Lions ahead of their game with the Atlanta Falcons in London last year . The 2005 Heisman Trophy winner was drafted second overall in the 2006 draft by the Saints. His five seasons in New Orleans yielded 33 touchdowns in 60 games and a Super Bowl victory. Bush moved to Miami Dolphins in 2011. He rushed for 2,072 yards, scoring 15 touchdowns over two seasons before joining the Lions in 2013. After going 8-8 and dispensing with Jim Harbaugh's services, the 49ers have undergone something of a facelift in the offseason. After a botched interview with Adam Gase, Jim Tomsula was promoted from defensive co-ordinator to head coach. And his short stint has seen the retirement of linebacker Patrick Willis, the loss of guard Mike Iupati to NFC West rivals Arizona and long-term staple Gore leave for Philadelphia. Cornerback Perrish Cox also departed to sign a bumper $15million three-year deal with Tennessee. The 49ers have added wide receiver Torrey Smith and defensive end Darnell Dockett and re-signed cornerback Chris Cook, as well as adding former rugby league sensation Jarryd Hayne to the roster.","Bush joins the 49ers after two seasons in Detroit .

"British hope Kyle Edmund failed to take advantage of his wildcard entry when he was swept out of the Miami Open first round.

"Mike Wallace has joined the Minnesota Vikings, two years after being courted by Rick Spielman and Co. Wallace was traded for a seventh round pick, in exchange for a fifth round pick in May's draft. His expensive and ill-tempered two seasons in Miami will be best remembered for a touchline spat. Wallace joined the Dolphins on a $60million deal before the 2013 season and was an outspoken member of the locker room. Mike Wallace scores a touchdown  during the Dolphins win against the Vikings last season . He often criticised the gameplan and was said to quit on his team-mates during December's defeat to the New York Jets.

"James DeGale is ready to fulfil his destiny after learning he will box for the world title in Boston on May 23. DeGale is bidding to become the first British Olympic champion to win top honours in the professional game, seven years after the Beijing Games. The Londoner will face Andre Dirrell for the IBF super-middleweight belt vacated by Carl Froch. James DeGale beat Marco Antonio Periban last year and now faces Andre Dirrell in Boston . 'It feels so good,' DeGale told Sportsmail. 'We've been trying to sort out this date for a long time. We were working towards April 25 at the O2 Arena so I've been training for the last eight weeks non-stop, sparring 12 rounds and doing my two-hour runs. 'In that way it's been frustrating but I've got my date now and all my focus goes on that. I'm relieved that everything's set and I'll be ready. 'After this week I'm going to have a week off then I'll get back on it. I've done eight weeks of training, I've been watching my weight and living like a monk.' Dirrell in action against Derek Edwards last year . DeGale's title challenge had originally been pencilled in for next month but promoter Eddie Hearn lost out when the fight went to purse bids. DeGale will, however, earn at least $1.5million (£1m). 'I would have liked to have boxed for a world title in my home city but it is what it is,' he admitted. 'Eddie lost the purse bid so I'm boxing in America. I'm getting paid very well for it and I've got the chance to make history; that's what dreams are made of.' Dirrell has lost once in his 25-fight career - to Froch in 2009 by contentious split decision. The 31-year-old has fought just six times since but recorded three routine victories last year. 'It's a difficult fight,' DeGale added. 'The guy is similar to me, he's very tricky and slick. He's a southpaw and it's an extremely hard fight but I think this is my time and I'm destined to be a world champion. I can't let this slip, I've got to win it. 'He's good with his feet and he punches in bunches but for all his attributes, I match him. It's going to be an intriguing fight to watch and very, very skilled. People are going to be in for a treat.'

Jensen may not have enjoyed the most successful of UFC careers, having won just two of six bouts, but there was no way he was going to lose this battle.

His detective work eventually led him to a nearby Walmart store as payment history showed that was the last place his cards had been used.

"Months after being labeled 'soft' by one of Australia's cricket greats and being dropped from Australia's test XI, Mitchell Starc has been deservedly voted the player of the World Cup. Starc's worth to the Australian team was never more evident than when he dismissed New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum in the first over of Sunday's final. The New Zealand innings never fully recovered and Australia went on to claim an emphatic seven-wicket victory. Few could have predicted the impact Starc would make at this tournament back in December when the left-arm swing bowler returned figures of 2-110 in the second Test against India in Brisbane, leading Shane Warne to describe Starc's body language as 'soft.'

The Australia team celebrate with the trophy after being crowned world champions in Melbourne . The 25-year-old Starc was subsequently dropped for the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the same venue where on Sunday he was named player of the tournament after using a new-found aggression to snare 22 wickets throughout the World Cup. 'I've worked really hard at it for a number of months now with (bowling coach) Craig McDermott in the background,' Starc said. 'A few series ago we sat down and found out a little plan and to see that come to fruition has been phenomenal.' He said his game-changing dismissal of McCullum off just the fifth ball of the final was part luck and part planning. Shane Warne, who had dismissed Starc as 'soft' before the tournament, poses with captain Michael Clarke . 'There was a lot of luck involved I think, but it was a little plan that Craig and I had going a couple of days ago,' he said. 'Brendon has been really fantastic through the whole tournament so I think there was a lot of luck involved. I'm just happy to get that one.' After a tournament notable for batting performances - including two double centuries, and teams regularly passing 300 runs, it was fitting that one of the few bowlers able to consistently make life difficult for the batsmen to win the coveted award. 'It was an amazing tournament and some outstanding performances,' Starc said. 'New Zealand has been a great team throughout the tournament and even set the benchmark, but I think we came hard today and (that) really led to this performance.'

"It went on for an age and a shambolic England side went home before it got interesting. Wisden Editor Lawrence Booth picks his highlights and lowlights of the Cricket World Cup... BEST BITS . The renaissance of left-arm seamers . The yorkers produced at will by man of the tournament Mitchell Starc played a huge part in Australia’s triumph. New Zealand’s Trent Boult joined him on top of the wicket-taking list with 22. And the most uplifting spell of the competition was Pakistan’s Wahab Riaz in the quarter-final. Australian Michael Starc took 22 wickets to be rated as the man of the tournament at the Cricket World Cup . Kiwis’ one-wicket win over Australia . In a World Cup containing more hundreds than ever before (38), no game was more thrilling than the low-scoring thriller at Eden Park in Auckland. Set 152, New Zealand slipped from 131 for 4 to 146 for 9, before Kane Williamson sealed it with a six amid scenes of delirium. Here was proof that the best games don’t need to be run-fests. Kiwi Kane Williamson hit a late six to seal a memorable one-wicket win over Australia in the group stages . The Associates . The first couple of weeks were lit up by teams who will mainly be shut out of the 2019 World Cup, which the ICC have limited to 10 teams: Ireland beat West Indies and Zimbabwe, Scotland gave New Zealand a scare, and Afghanistan beat Scotland. While other sports look to expand their games, cricket’s administrators remain content to shrink theirs. Baffling. Kevin O'Brien celebrates taking a wicket as Ireland sensationally upset West Indies in Nelson . Sangakkara still going strong . Sri Lanka’s quarter-final defeat by South Africa meant Kumar Sangakkara’s one-day international career ended with a whimper — but not before he had scored an astonishing four successive centuries in the group matches. Even at 37, he remained the classiest act in the World Cup. India veteran batsman Kumar Sangakkara acknowledges one of four successive centuries . The fans . More than a million spectators attended the 49 games, with the New Zealand public getting behind the World Cup in a manner that delighted the ICC. If cricket’s popularity in that country has been guaranteed for the next decade and beyond, the World Cup will have done its job. The Cricket World Cup attracted over a million supporters for 49 games, some left more pleased than others . WORST BITS . England . They were the laughing stock, completing the worst of their six World Cups since reaching the final in 1992 — and there’s been some stiff competition. They never recovered from maulings by Australia and New Zealand, failed to defend over 300 against Sri Lanka, and even lost to Bangladesh. For captain Eoin Morgan, the whole thing was a disaster. New ODI captain Eoin Morgan presided over England's worst performance at a World Cup . Too few close finishes . Four one-sided quarter- finals typified a tournament in which too few of the games went to the wire, or even close to it. In fact, of the seven knockout matches, only the New Zealand-South Africa semi-final raised the pulse. And, as in 2011, the group stage dragged on and on and on. New Zealand's semi-final defeat of South Africa was the only knockout game that entertained . The final . Australia’s dominance turned the climax into an anti-climax. Let’s not pretend, as some have tried, that this was the best World Cup ever. The Australians were too far ahead of the rest for that, brushing aside India in the semis and New Zealand in the final. In truth, Australia were head and shoulders above the competition as their stroll in the final showed .","Australia defeated New Zealand to be crowned cricket world champions .

"Australia captain Michael Clarke bids farewell to one-day international cricket on Sunday — to save himself for one more shot at humiliating England. The 33-year-old has decided to retire from the 50-over game after steering his country to the World Cup final, with the sole intention of leading the Aussies into this summer’s Ashes showdown in England. ‘A priority for me is to continue to be successful in the Test format,’ said Clarke. ‘I think by walking away from one-day cricket it probably gives me my best opportunity.’ Michael Clarke shakes hands with New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum ahead of Sunday's final . And that spells danger for England with Clarke hungrier than ever to finally win an away Ashes series, having lost on all three of his previous trips. Clarke scored two centuries guiding Australia to their 5-0 whitewash of Alastair Cook’s dismal team last winter, but he’s desperate to break his duck in England in what will almost certainly be his last Ashes away tour. ‘I’ve never hid behind the fact that I find Test cricket to be the pinnacle of our sport,’ said Clarke, who has won 108 Test caps including 30 against England. The 33-year-old made the surprise announcement at a press conference on Saturday morning . ‘I’ve never gone down that road anyway in regard to what is the best thing to do for the public interest, as I’m sure you would have seen through my career, I’ve copped my fair share of smacks in the mouth. ‘But I am whoI am and it’s about being true to myself and I don’t feel bad about saying I believe Test cricket is the toughest part of our game. I love that challenge, I find it extremely difficult every Test match I play. I do see it as the pinnacle. I still think I’ve got a lot to offer the team as captain of the Australian Test team, and I want to make sure I continue to have success in that format.’ Clarke was made captain in all formats when Ricky Ponting stood down following the 2011 World Cup. He will be making his 245th one-day appearance for Australia and his 75th as skipper on Sunday as Australia take on New Zealand, led by Brendon McCullum (inset). George Bailey and Steve Smith are thought to be the two men most likely to succeed Clarke in captaining the Aussies.

Clarke has been suffering with a back problem for some time and a hamstring injury ruled him out of Australia’s World Cup build up with George Bailey and Steve Smith, the two men most likely to succeed him, both leading the side. ‘I don’t think it is realistic that I’ll be fit and healthy and available to play the next World Cup so I believe it is the right time,’ he said. ‘I think I’ll leave the one-day game for the Australian team in a better place than when I took over the captaincy.’","Cricket World Cup final will be Michael Clarke's last one-day international .

"Geoff Parling's second-half try and the boot of Freddie Burns helped Leicester beat Exeter 25-18 and gain some revenge at Welford Road. A fortnight ago the Chiefs saw off the Tigers in a thrilling LV= Cup semi-final and the teams met again at Welford Road in the Aviva Premiership, with the hosts hoping for a different outcome having lost just once in front of their own fans this season. And despite former Tiger Thomas Waldrom and Will Chudley going over for the Chiefs, the home side were celebrating as Burns kicked 20 points and Parling crossed the whitewash, with Leicester climbing above Exeter in the table in the process. Geoff Parling's second-half try helped Leicester Tigers beat Exeter Chiefs on Saturday . Parling (right) celebrates with team-mate Sebastian de Chaves following his try . Exeter had the first chance of the match from a penalty in the fourth minute when Leicester were caught offside with Henry Slade electing to kick from his own half with the wind behind him, however he put the chance wide. Barely three minutes later, Slade again missed a penalty after Leicester's Miles Benjamin had failed to move out of the way and the Tigers made them pay with Burns putting a penalty of their own away to give the Tigers the lead. With high balls causing havoc in the swirling wind and handling errors from Exeter, Burns then added a second penalty for Leicester on 18 minutes to double the home side's lead. Exeter finally got on the board in the 23nd minute with Slade this time successful with a kick from his own half. In the 36th minute the Tigers regained their six-point lead after Exeter failed to roll away after an excellent break from Benjamin, with Burns making no mistake again from the tee. It came at a price though with Benjamin leaving the field injured, replaced by Vereniki Goneva. The Tigers almost had the first try of the game on the stroke of half-time after another breakaway, but had to make do with a fourth penalty from Burns as Leicester went into the break with a 12-3 lead. Fly half Freddie Burns kicked six penalties for Leicester as they overcame Exeter . Exeter Chiefs' Thomas Waldrom scores a try against his former club . Exeter Chiefs' Will Chudley also scored a try but it was not enough to prevent his side from losing . It was the Tigers on the front foot from the start of the second half and with barely a minute gone they were awarded a penalty with Burns, in imperious form with the boot, slotting home his fifth penalty of the match to put Leicester further in front. Exeter swiftly made changes with the hope of getting back into the game with Ben Moon, Ben White and Tom James coming on. And it made the immediate impact as hoped with Waldrom scoring the first try of the game after an Exeter drive near the posts. Slade inexplicably missed the conversion, hitting the post when it seemed easier to score. It was the Tigers' turn to force the pressure with Goneva going close in the corner as both teams changed personnel. The pressure told as Leicester's dominance in the scrum saw Parling go over in the corner, with Burns adding the conversion to give the Tigers a 22-8 lead with a quarter of an hour remaining. Exeter hit straight back with a try of their own as Chudley went under the posts after a breakaway. Slade made no mistake this time to reduce the deficit to seven points with the Tigers still leading 22-15. Burns added a further penalty to increase the lead to 10 but missed his first kick of the game with just minutes remaining as he attempted one from his own half. A late Slade penalty was not enough for Exeter, however, as the Tigers saw out any further trouble to climb above their visitors in the table.","Geoff Parling scores second half try for Leicester .

"Newcastle have announced record profits of £18.7million for last season but fans say the figures have provoked more questions than answers. The club have not released the full annual report, only selected highlights with no detailed explanation as to how £28.5million of extra costs have been incurred. Mark Jensen, editor of online fanzine themag.co.uk, said he had expected profits for the 2013/14 campaign to be closer to £50million given the increase in income from television rights and the sale of Yohan Cabaye to Paris St Germain for around £20million. Yohan Cabaye poses with his new team jersey after a news conference at the Parc des Princes stadium . Newcastle also reported revenues increased by 35 per cent from £95.9million to £129.7million. More than half of Newcastle's income - £78.3million - came from the Premier League television rights deals, with commercial income also increasing. Jensen told Press Association Sport: 'This has just provoked more questions than answers. There is £28.5million of costs for which there is no explanation. The wages-to-turnover ratio is also not included. 'We had anticipated a profit of around £50m, especially with Cabaye being sold. 'The way that most fans look at it is that Newcastle didn't buy a single player in the whole season and sold Cabaye. Everyone knows how much these clubs are getting from TV so Newcastle fans would like to think more profit would mean more team strengthening but that has not been the case. Cabaye moved to PSG in a deal worth more than £20million and the reports have left questions to answer . 'There seems to be both a lack of transparency and ambition.' Newcastle finished 10th last season and are currently 12th in the Premier League table. A Newcastle statement said: 'Most significantly, the club reported strong commercial revenue growth delivering £25.6million in 2014, up from £17.1million in 2013. This 49.7 per cent increase was largely the result of two lucrative new deals with the club's principal sponsors, Wonga and Puma.' It is the fourth successive year the club has made a profit and cements Newcastle's positions in financial terms as one of the most successful in the top flight.

"Nigel Owens does a bit of stand-up comedy in his spare time, as well as after-dinner speaking, and one can imagine him being quite funny. The Welsh referee, considered among the finest in world rugby, was amusing in his response to being flattened by Jimmy Cowan a few years ago. ‘Try going past me next time,’ he remarked, after eventually returning to his feet, even though he knew full well that he, and not the New Zealand scrum-half, was at fault. It was entertaining to listen to him this week as he reflected on a hugely impressive performance at Twickenham last Saturday. Welsh referee Nigel Owens disputes a decision with England captain Chris Robshaw at Twickenham . Television viewers were struck by the manner in which he handled the players during an extraordinary game that occasionally became bad-tempered. He defused certain situations quite beautifully, even addressing individuals by their full Christian names to exert some authority. Chris Robshaw became ‘Christopher’, with Owens praising the England skipper and his opposite number for playing some marvellous rugby while ordering them to cut out the nonsense. It worked — players addressed him as ‘sir’. Rugby players generally tend to respect referees rather more than their footballing counterparts but Owens, 43, commands more respect than most. Owens commands more respect than many referees when taking charge of top level rugby . When he was the victim of homophobic chanting at Twickenham last autumn, — two England fans were fined and banned for abusing Owens for being gay — he received messages of support from players from England as well as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, France and Wales. And when he once asked Ronan O’Gara to sign a copy of his autobiography for his father, the then Ireland fly-half wished Geraint Owens a happy Christmas, but also added how proud he should be of his son. He will go up in the estimation of most for the way he handled a situation only this week. The victim of a homophobic tweet after last weekend’s Six Nations encounter, Owens agreed to travel to Carmarthen Police Station to meet the 18-year-old who had abused him. As part of an agreed Adult Community Resolution — an alternative way of resolving crimes that allows victims to be involved in deciding how the offender can be dealt with by choosing from a list of out-of-court options — Owens accepted what he described as ‘a profound apology’ and let the matter rest. International referee Nigel Owens jokes around with wrestler Barri Griffiths on a Welsh TV show . Owens, who does some stand-up comedy in his spare time, appears to enjoy the limelight . ‘It’s like refereeing a game of rugby,’ Owens told me. ‘You can’t referee in black and white. There is an awful lot of grey and you have to apply a bit of common sense. ‘This young man was genuinely remorseful for something he accepts was stupid. He apologised to me publicly on Twitter and on Facebook. ‘He could have been left with a criminal record but I saw no point in that on this occasion. The key thing is to get the message out there that it’s not acceptable to insult someone in that way. ‘I have learned to handle this kind of abuse. But there will be people out there who are struggling the way I once did and they will find it extremely hurtful. This is about protecting them.’ Getting the key decisions right is how a referee is ultimately judged but players seem to like Owens’ style. ‘Until someone said it to me I hadn’t realised I’d called Robshaw “Christopher”,’ he says. ‘I suppose you could see it as a device that makes clear to someone you’re not entirely happy with them. It might be the way a teacher addresses a pupil. I did work as a technician at a school for a number of years and also with kids in youth clubs. The 43-year-old directs England and France players during the feisty encounter at Twickenham last weekend . ‘But I’d probably address most people by their full name until I know them a bit better. ‘I learned from Derek Bevan, a great referee, and I think the secret is to be authoritative, firm and fair but not over-officious. ‘If you show the players respect they tend to respect you. And sometimes you can defuse a situation with a smile or a quick bit of wit. That’s probably where comedy comes in handy. I’ve been doing stand-up since I was 14.’ Rugby is his first love, but Owens follows football too and he takes an interest in some of the issues currently concerning referees in the round-ball game. The crowding of referees is a particular concern, while there is growing pressure for video technology. Owens shakes hands with Robshaw after last Saturday's Six Nations clash at Twickenham . ‘I certainly don’t think you can officiate at the top level in rugby without the technology that helps you get the key decisions right,’ he says. ‘That’s what we want to achieve across all sports. ‘It’s still not perfect. Even with a video replay, mistakes can still be made. But it’s definitely something I believe football would benefit from. ‘On occasions in rugby it is over-used and we have to guard against that. And football doesn’t have the natural stoppages that make it a bit easier to call on video technology in rugby. Football has more of a natural flow. ‘I think something like a captain’s challenge would be interesting; say one challenge per half per team for the decisions that really matter.’ The Welsh referee, who took charge of England vs France last weekend, has done stand-up since he was 14 . Respect is the other issue; one, in fairness to football, that the authorities have tried to tackle with different campaigns over the years. ‘Only if you are very naive would you say football doesn’t have an issue with respect,’ says Owens. ‘But rugby shouldn’t take the moral high ground either because I’ve seen problems in our sport too. I’ve seen referees being pushed in grassroots games and so on. ‘Ultimately it’s a problem in society, although football has to recognise it can influence how young people behave in society. But I think the laws of rugby allow referees to deal with these kind of issues more effectively. There are more breaks in rugby that enable you to speak to the players. ‘Referees could also be supported in terms of the citing process. If I make a mistake by giving a player a yellow card when it should have been red, it can be given retrospectively as a red. ‘This doesn’t happen in football, but if players knew that was a possibility — that the citing process was toughened up — it would lead to better behaviour on the field.’","43-year-old took charge of England vs France Six Nations clash .

"Barcelona club captain Xavi looks set to leave the Catalan giants for Qatar, with Al Sadd confirming the deal is all but signed. Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo have claimed 'Destination Qatar' with the 35-year-old poised to sign a three-year deal worth around £7m a season. Mundo Deportivo reports that Al Sadd announced Xavi had already signed for next season, although they later back tracked and said it will be announced in 'his own time.' Mundo Deportivo report that Xavi's deal to sign for Al Sadd in Qatar is imminent, ending a fine Barca career . The Spanish paper also claims Barcelona will give 'total freedom' to their legendary captain, who has won 22 major trophies with Nou Camp club during a magnificent career, to do 'what he considers appropriate.' Xaxi has played for Barca a record 751 times since he graduated from their academy to the first team in 1998 but has had limited game time this season under coach Luis Enrique. The 35-year-old has a contract at Barcelona until 2016 but now looks set to play his last ever game for the club either against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey cup final in the Nou Camp on May 30, or in the Champions League final in Berlin on June 6 should Enrique's side progress that far.

"Craig Gordon insists Dundee United’s Ryan McGowan will revel in his role as Public Enemy No 1 at Celtic Park on Saturday. Speaking as the clubs prepare to meet for the fourth time in a fortnight, the Parkhead goalkeeper played down talk of a running feud after the tally of red cards rose to six in three games during Wednesday night’s ill-tempered Scottish Cup replay. Celtic striker Anthony Stokes was dismissed just moments before McGowan’s sending off for an uncompromising challenge on Liam Henderson, which was later dubbed ‘dangerous’ and ‘career-threatening’ by Ronny Deila. Goalkeeper Craig Gordon has played down talk of a running feud with Dundee United . However, the Australian international will play in Saturday’s SPFL clash after appealing his red card – and is certain to face a hostile reception from the Parkhead crowd. A former Hearts club-mate of the full-back, however, Gordon believes McGowan will be unfazed, saying: ‘I know Ryan, and he will probably enjoy it. ‘He’s that type of boy. He wears his heart on his sleeve and he goes out and gives 100 per cent. ‘If it is the case he is booed, I don’t think he will be overawed by that. ‘He was in the youth team when I was at Hearts. I never played with him. But I knew of him coming through. ‘It is something he will have to deal with, and I am sure he will. ‘But, as far as the players are concerned, there is nothing in that. We will just concentrate on ourselves.’ Ryan McGowan is sent off by referee Calum Murray after he scythed down Celtic sub Liam Henderson . McGowan used Twitter to apologise to Henderson in the aftermath of the game, but angered Celtic supporters by appealing a red card many believed to be clear-cut. ‘He likes a tackle,’ added Gordon. ‘He has no problem with that. ‘Perhaps he maybe just lost the head for a split second with the way the games have been going. ‘And that’s a difficult thing to actually put up with if you are losing a couple of games to the same opposition and somebody is trying a bit of skill to beat you in the corner. ‘It takes a lot to keep a calm head. But both sets of players are going to have to do that to make sure we keep a full complement of players on the pitch. ‘There is nothing there in terms of between the players. But, during the 90 minutes, both teams want to win desperately.’ McGowan took to social media again yesterday to refer indirectly to the furore, Tweeting: ‘Heard it’s very “dangerous” possibly “career threatening” for ur eyes to watch the eclipse without glasses! Lucky I have mine with me.’ No fan of Twitter, Gordon insists he hadn’t seen it, but grinned: ‘He has always been a confident lad, and that has probably helped him. ‘Hearts fans still hold him in very high regard, probably just as much for his Twitter account as for his football. Deila celebrates at full-time as his side reached the Scottish Cup semi-finals with a 4-0 victory . ‘But, that’s just part and parcel of modern football, I suppose.’ Playing down predictions of more red cards or settled scores as Celtic seek to keep Aberdeen at bay in the title race, Gordon dismissed talk of a feud between the two sets of players. ‘I don’t think so,’ he said. ‘Fortunately, I’ve not been involved in any of the incidents. ‘Our players have been fine after the games. There’s not really been anything too much. ‘There have been a few isolated incidents on the pitch. But I don’t think there has been anything beyond that, certainly not from my point of view. ‘It’s up to us as players to keep it under control and make sure we are pointing our aggression in the right way and keeping a lid on it. ‘It’s the fourth game and it will probably form a similar pattern, in that we will have to win the battle if we are going to win the game.’ United midfielder Paul Paton, accused of using an elbow on Stokes before the Celtic striker’s red card on Wednesday, turned up the heat by suggesting the Parkhead side have been ‘manipulating’ referees for years. Responding by pointing to the leniency shown towards Calum Butcher and Nadir Ciftci by the SFA, however, Gordon said: ‘Maybe there were times when decisions went against us at Hearts. But I can’t think there was ever a time where I thought that was the case. ‘I didn’t tend to think that way. ‘United had a few decent decisions in the last few games, as well, so if they want to start bringing up one incident against the other, there’s so many talking points in the last couple of games, whether it be sending offs or penalties. ‘There is a case to be made for a number of decisions going opposite ways for both sides.’","Celtic face Dundee United for fourth time in a fortnight on Saturday .

"A domestic treble is a marathon rather than a sprint. Yet Celtic are closer to their promised land after routing the Arabs in Scottish football’s answer to the six-day war. By 5pm on Saturday, Dundee United were worn out. As punch drunk as a flabby heavyweight leaning against the ropes in the 14th round. Exhausted — mentally and physically — by three losses in a week to a side with more depth, energy and firepower. The Tayside team fancied their chances after holding on for a 1-1 Scottish Cup draw with nine men a fortnight ago. Then Celtic won the League Cup Final. And followed it with a thumping 4-0 victory in last Wednesday’s Scottish Cup replay. Jason Denayer celebrates with his team-mates after giving Celtic a three-goal lead before half-time . Denayer taps home from close range as Celtic record comfortable victory against Dundee United . Battered and bruised, United were gone then. Long before they found themselves three goals down in the first half of this league match. The heat, light and fury which bred six red cards, three penalties and running feuds in the previous meetings had gone. All told, Celtic and Dundee United met four times in two weeks. By the end, Jackie McNamara’s team were pleased the ordeal was over. The same might be said of the title race. In Saturday’s early game, Aberdeen shipped two points in Dundee. The Dens equaliser came from the grandson of former Parkhead chairman Jack McGinn. Proof, if it were needed, that this was Celtic’s week. ‘It’s been a great week,’ said defender Efe Ambrose. ‘We know that, but we don’ t want to look at what we’ve done. We want to look forwards and that means the next game. That’s more important than what we’ve already done. ‘Every game counts in the league and we want to keep going. From now until the end of the season, we want to keep doing our best, so we can defend our title and get to the Scottish Cup Final. Then we can see if the Treble is still possible.’ John Guidetti struck to make it 2-0 to Ronny Deila's side after 33 minutes at Celtic Park on Saturday . The Scottish Cup looks the last substantial hurdle. Inverness, an awkward opponent, await in the semi-final on April 19. Thereafter it is Hibs or Falkirk in the Final. ‘It’s an enjoyable place to be at the moment because everything is working well for us,’ said Ambrose. ‘I think, right now, it would take a lot of effort from another team to stop us. ‘Celtic are playing at a top level. It’s difficult for others to withstand what we have right now. Guidetti is congratulated by his team-mates after doubling the home side's lead . ‘We have a huge squad and everyone is in their best form. It’s difficult for the manager to pick his starting line-up. There’s a lot of competition in the squad and that makes us better.’ There was nothing boastful in the way the Nigerian said this. He was merely stating a bald truth. For the fourth meeting with United in a fortnight, Ronny Deila replaced his entire front four. Leigh Griffiths, Kris Commons, James Forrest and Anthony Stokes made way for John Guidetti, Stefan Johansen, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven. Mackay-Steven and Armstrong were United’s star players until they were sold to Celtic for £2million in January. Gary Mackay-Steven opened the scoring against his former club to set up victory for Celtic . Once again, Tannadice chairman Stephen Thompson had cause to ponder if it was worth it when Mackay-Steven smashed a superb opening goal in 16 minutes, accepting a simple Ambrose pass and winding up for a swerving left-foot shot from fully 25 yards. As a former United player, his reluctance to celebrate was understandable. Why Guidetti did likewise after doubling the lead in 33 minutes with a looping, deflected shot into the top corner was harder to work out. By then, Celtic were playing a training game. A flat affair, given the ill feeling of the previous encounters, the home support could barely even bring themselves to boo Ryan McGowan. There was a brief flash of the old enmity when Paul Paton was lucky to escape a red card for a wild, scything tackle on Mackay-Steven on the stroke of half-time. If a yellow was a lenient punishment, Celtic added to the penalty by scoring a third when Virgil van Dijk thumped Johansen’s low free-kick towards goal before Jason Denayer intercepted and cheekily back heeled into the net for 3-0. Mackay-Steven (left) celebrates his goal with Stefan Johansen during the Scottish Premiership match . The Belgian has found a rich vein of form and, as with van Dijk, the Celtic support should enjoy him while they can. Dundee United came close just once, when substitute Ryan Dow had a dipping, long-range effort tipped over the bar by Craig Gordon. In truth, the visitors looked utterly demoralised by then. ‘I thought we were soft in the first half and we accepted things,’ said McNamara. ‘So I told them I was disappointed in that. I was a bit angry at half-time about belief and not just pride, but in terms of doing things and not feeling sorry for themselves. ‘In the second half, we did that. We rolled up our sleeves, though it could be argued that Celtic took their feet off the gas.’ They could afford to conserve their energies. Only three times in Celtic’s 127-year history have the club won a Treble and they are now tantalisingly close to a fourth. ‘I never allow myself to think about the Treble,’ parried Ambrose. ‘None of us do. ‘The most important thing for the team is to go game by game and that’s what the manager wants. We take it as it comes. ‘We don’t put anything in our heads. The important thing is to play hard and prepare. Everyone wants to beat Celtic. ‘It’s important that we’re calm and work to the tactics the manager wants us to play. ‘We need to have one spirit, one heart. We have good momentum right now and I think we have delivered what the manager expected. We’re almost there. ‘But we’re not there yet, so we have to keep pushing in training. Every time we play a game, he wants us to improve, so that’s a challenge he has given to us.’ A popular whipping Bhoy when things go wrong, it’s worth recording that Ambrose himself has improved of late. The Green Brigade sang his name on Saturday, prompting a wry chuckle from a player who seems a little safer at right-back than centre-half. ‘The Celtic supporters are the best in the world,’ said the defender, ‘I will give them credit for that. ‘Sometimes it’s unfair if I get criticism but that’s football. We’re a team, not individuals. ‘If a mistake happens, you just have to get on with it, work harder and make sure you correct the mistake.’ Of late, Deila’s Celtic have managed not only to correct their early season mistakes, but eradicate them. As the final mile of the marathon approaches, they are pacing themselves nicely.","Gary Mackay-Steven opened the scoring for Celtic after 16 minutes .

"Bryan Robson has pinpointed Ander Herrera as one of the key figures in Manchester United's revival. United are fourth in the table just two points behind second-placed Manchester City. They face their neighbours and defending champions on April 12 during a crucial four game spell that sees them take on Aston Villa, Chelsea and Everton. However, the manner of their victories against Tottenham and Liverpool in recent weeks has been ominous. Bryan Robson has hailed Ander Herrera as one of the key figures in Manchester United's revival this year . Herrera celebrates after scoring the opening goal during their FA Cup third round match with Yeovil Town . Former United captain Robson recognises that Juan Mata has been winning the bulk of the plaudits but admires the qualities Herrera is showing. 'Ander started off the season well and he’s got a lot of energy,' Robson told ManUtd.com. 'He is always on the move, trying to close people down really quickly. He has got a lot of qualities really, it’s just getting them out of him on a consistent basis. But he has got that in his locker, maybe it’s just taken him and a few of the new signings time to adapt to the Premier League.' Herrera set up Mata's first goal against Liverpool with an inch-perfect pass and the 25-year-old acquisition from Athletic Bilbao has shown signs of being able to provide a greater tempo to United's play. 'He is quite good defensively and, when I watch him, I can see he has a lot of energy and he does like to get involved' added Robson. 'What I like about him is that, when people are on the ball, he is always on the move to try and receive the pass.'

"Bafetimbi Gomis illustrated his ability to respond to adversity by returning to the Swansea team soon after suffering a frightening fainting episode. He did similar at Villa Park, rousing himself after three missed chances to bury the winner in the closing stages.

'I don't have the feeling that they (the Dutch Football Association, the KNVB) want to sack me and I still have a lot of fun in my job. There is nothing going on.' Pressure on Hiddink had earlier been heightened after Cruyff's damning verdict on the performance against Turkey. 'Holland were terrible against Turkey. Nobody did what they had to do,' Cruyff wrote in his column in De Telegraaf. 'The defenders were only passing the ball to the midfielders and they then passed it back to the defenders,' he added. 'The people with little creativity were dictating play. This is not what you want. The problems only got bigger.' Holland have the opportunity to make amends when they host Spain on Tuesday in a friendly which sees the two sides meet for the first time since the Dutch routed the then World Cup holders 5-1 at the 2014 tournament in Brazil. Spain prepared for the friendly with a 1-0 home victory over Ukraine, a strike from Alvaro Morata moving them three points clear of their rivals in second place in Group C.

"Portugal manager Fernando Santos has revealed his desire to sew up qualification for Euro 2016 before their return trip to face Serbia in a tricky tie in Belgrade on the final day of qualifying. Santos' side face Serbia at Lisbon's Estadio da Luz on Sunday, hoping that star man and captain Cristiano Ronaldo can help open up a gap on one of their rivals for a place at the finals in France next summer. With a win offering the Portuguese a chance to leapfrog Denmark at the top of the group, Santos wants to take what he sees as a key step towards sealing qualification. Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Fernando Santos (right) talk ahead of Portugal's Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday . Santos has made it clear that the game against Serbia is very important to their qualification hopes . Ronaldo took the chance to show off during training as Portugal went through their paces on Saturday . Speaking after training, Santos said: 'The game is not decisive but it is very important. We depend only on ourselves, and if we win we get to depend only of us in an even stronger way. In this sense it is a very important game. 'The desire is to go to Belgrade (when they face Serbia on October 11) with qualification from the group already guaranteed.' Ronaldo has scored both of low-scoring Portugal's two goals in qualifying so far, securing late wins over Denmark and Armenia after a shock opening-fixture defeat by Albania.

However, Santos said that he would not be preparing his players to give any 'special attention' to any opposition players. 'There will be no special care for anyone,' he said. 'Portugal respects all of their players, Matic, (Zoran) Tosic, Markovic, I won't go on as I would have to name them all.

"Martin Skrtel is set to become the second Liverpool player banned for stamping in the defeat to Manchester United after he was charged with violent conduct by the FA.. The Slovakia defender is alleged to have deliberately trodden on goalkeeper David de Gea towards the end of United’s 2-1 win at Anfield on Sunday, leading to an angry confrontation between the two players after the final whistle. The FA were able to take action after referee Martin Atkinson confirmed that he did not see the incident, and a three-man panel unanimously agreed that it was a red card offence. Skrtel, 30, has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge. Martin Skrtel's foot lands on David de Gea's leg, with the FA to decide whether there was any intent . Skrtel avoided any punishment at the time, with Martin Atkinson blowing for full time seconds later . Liverpool could easily have lost a second player at the very end of the game when Skrtel followed through on David De Gea but Atkinson showed a consistent approach and let the game end in a deserved away win. Teammate Steven Gerrard has already been hit with a three-match ban after he was sent off for stamping on Ander Herrera just 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute. It would be a further blow to Liverpool’s hopes of overhauling United in the race for a top-four finish if Skrtel is suspended as well. The centre-back was pushed forward in search of an equaliser and trod on De Gea as the United goalkeeper slid in to gather the ball at his feet. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers admitted that the video footage did not look good in slow motion, but insisted that Skrtel was going for the ball. He said: ‘The ball has been played through and it looks like, when it is slowed down, that he has caught him with intent. I didn’t see it like that. He is trying to get the ball.’ But a statement from the FA read: ‘Martin Skrtel has been charged by the FA for violent conduct following an on-field incident which was not seen by the match officials but caught on video. ‘In Premier League matches, if an incident has not been seen by the match officials, a three-man panel of former elite officials will be asked by the FA to review the footage independently of each other. ‘For an FA charge to follow, all three panel members must agree it is a sending-off offence.

Martin Skrtel has been charged by The FA for violent conduct following an on-field incident which was not seen by the match officials but caught on video.

"Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and manager Brendan Rodgers have called for the players to use the defeat against Manchester United as motivation for a renewed top-four push. The 2-1 loss at Anfield was their first in the league since losing at Old Trafford in mid-December and left them five points adrift of their arch-rivals, who occupy the final Champions League qualification spot. But just as the squad reacted to losing to United just before Christmas the expectation now is for them to bounce back and maintain the challenge.

Mata and his United team-mates celebrate doubling their lead en route to their 2-1 win in the Premier League . Mata celebrates his incredible goal that the Spanish midfielder admits was one of the best he'd ever scored . 'There's still a lot to play for and when we come back from international duty, we've got that big game against Arsenal (in third),' Mignolet told liverpoolfc.com. 'The game away to Manchester United at Old Trafford we used as a catalyst to put in a lot of good performances - so let's use this game as a catalyst again when we come back. 'With all the games still to play until the end of the season we can still do really well.

Rio hit by a coin, Rooney swearing live on TV... what else makes our 50 shocking moments in Premier League history? CLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT OUR LIST . Rodgers has urged the squad to use the international break to put the defeat behind them and return ready for a difficult trip to the Emirates Stadium. 'The message to the players was that last performance at Old Trafford was a great springboard for us,' he said. 'We went on and, up until this point (against United), we hadn't lost a league game. 'So now we must use this similarly; refocus, get over the disappointment and then come back into a tough game next against Arsenal and really look to get the points there.' The Reds boss remains confident the defeat, which saw captain Steven Gerrard sent off less than a minute after coming on at half-time, will not derail their bid for the top four. 'It makes it difficult (for the top four). We had a 10-game objective that we set and built into that was that we were not going to win every single game,' added Rodgers. 'It's still very much (possible) for us to go where we want to go, which is the top four. 'We just need to fight that bit harder and make up a five-point difference.' Mignolet enhanced his improving reputation further with an added-time penalty save against Wayne Rooney but admitted it gave him little pleasure in the wider context. Steven Gerrard is shown a red card early in the second half for a foul on Manchester United's Mata . Gerrard can't believe it after being sent off for a reckless stamp on United's Ander Herrera at Anfield . Here is the stamp from Gerrard on Herrera after both players had competed for the ball . 'The penalty save isn't important any more although Skrts (Martin Skrtel) had a chance after that,' he added. 'When you play at home, you always want to win, but unfortunately it didn't happen. 'They scored in the first half and against a team like Manchester United, it's always difficult after that. 'In the second half, we tried to come back with a new plan to try to make sure we got a result out of the game.

'With 10 men we fought hard to get something out of the game and we got the goal through Daniel (Sturridge) but unfortunately we didn't then get the chance to get an equaliser.' Mignolet also praised Gerrard on his post-match apology for his moment of madness. 'That's what he is about,' said the Belgium international. 'He spoke to the team after the game inside the dressing room and what was said exactly shall stay in there, but it shows who and what he is off the pitch.'","Liverpool were beaten by rivals Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday .

"Juventus forward Alvaro Morata is likely to feature up front for Spain in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Ukraine in Seville, coach Vicente del Bosque said on Thursday. Morata is the obvious choice in the striker's role for the European champions following the withdrawal due to injury of Diego Costa as second-placed Spain look to maintain pressure on Group C leaders Slovakia. 'We have been training with all the players we have, we have deployed them in the positions they are going to play and we have a lot of expectations of Morata,' Del Bosque told a news conference ahead of the game at Sevilla's Sanchez Pizjuan stadium. Alvaro Morata is set to start for Spain in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Ukraine on Friday . Morata has two international caps to his name but looks likely to add to his tally on Friday . Morata is put under pressure by Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos during a training session on Thursday . Spain manager Vicente del Bosque confirmed that Morata was likely to start up front against Ukraine . 'It has been positive that he has enriched himself by moving abroad and it is good that he has had playing time (at Juve),' Del Bosque added. Morata joined the Italian champions from Real Madrid in the close season after breaking into Real's first team from the youth ranks but finding his playing time limited. The 22-year-old, who has scored seven goals in 22 Serie A appearances this term for the Italian champions, is competing for a place up front with the likes of Barcelona's Pedro and Malaga's Juanmi. Cesc Fabregas, who plays in midfield for Chelsea but has often been drafted in as an extra striker for his country, is another option. Morata was given strong backing by Spain team mates Sergio Ramos and Andres Iniesta. The Spain squad were put through their paces ahead of the match against Ukraine .

'He deserves to be here,' Real centre back Ramos said. 'He is a forward who stirs things up, who looks for the spaces, who moves well up front and he gives the national team a very good alternative.' Barcelona playmaker Iniesta added: 'We all know Alvaro's quality. He is really playing well and that's why he is here with us. 'He is a born goalscorer, he is always pushing the limit of offside and his precision and movement make your job easier.'

"Zinedine Zidane has revealed he would be keen to manage Real Madrid if he was offered the role by club president Florentino Perez. Zidane has been in charge of Madrid's Castilla side since deciding to focus on his own managerial career following his season-long stint as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant.

Zinedine Zidane has revealed he would find it hard to reject the opportunity of managing Real Madrid . Zidane worked under Carlo Ancelotti during the course of last season before becoming Castilla boss . And Zidane, speaking to Canal+, has admitted he would be keen on replacing Ancelotti if the Italian was to leave the La Liga giants. 'If the post of Real's coach was proposed to me, I would certainly agree. But there is a coach right now who is doing a very good job. And I'm in a structure and still learning. 'Am I ready for the job? You are never ready, and even if you're not you still say yes. As a player, I didn't forge my career in two years. Things happen gradually. In coaching, it will be the same.

"World Cup winners Germany will be at their best when they take on Euro 2016 qualifying rivals Poland, Scotland and Ireland  after their current period of experimentation, insists Joachim Low. The Germans drew 2-2 in a friendly against Asian champions Australia on Wednesday before a 2-0 victory at Georgia in a Euro qualifier on Sunday. While easing past the Georgians to stay on track for qualification, Germany missed a string of chances again as they struggled with their finishing. Joachim Low's side have failed to replicate the form previously shown at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Germany playmaker Mario Gotze (right) wastes a golden chance against Georgia by shooting wide . Low, who has extended his contract recently to 2018, has said he wants to tinker with his team that won the World Cup last year to make it more flexible and adaptable to different opponents. A three-man defence and more attacking full backs have been two of his experiments, with the coach also trying to find a good mix of youth and experience after the departure of three key players following the World Cup and the return of several long-term absentees, including Marco Reus, Ilkay Guendogan and Holger Badstuber. He has also announced more young players will be in his squad from September onwards. 'We now have a test in the summer against the United States and there I can still try some things out,' Low said of their June 10 friendly before they face Gibraltar in a qualifier three days later. 'After that our forces will then be very focused for our games in September, October and November.'

They take on Ireland, who are on eight points, on October 8. 'Experience shows that at that time we are always in much better form because we have the chance to be longer together as a group, to play matches and train,' Low said. 'In the second half of the year we are always better.' While Germany are expected to qualify for the tournament in France, Low is delighted to have Reus back and in goalscoring form following a string of injuries last year, with the speedy winger on target in both games. 'He had a lot of bad luck in the past months and used a lot of strength and energy to come back. Our game is more versatile when he is playing and also much more dangerous.'","2014 World Cup winners Germany recently drew 2-2 with Australia .

"During the lengthy inquest into England’s dismal performance at last summer’s World Cup, Roy Hodgson reflected on a team that had been roughed up at the highest level. England were bullied off the ball in the opening two games against Italy and Uruguay, showing too much respect for the opposition. Hodgson demanded change. His team had been intimidated by Luis Suarez, second best to every ball, as England were dumped out of the World Cup after just six days. Luis Suarez bullied and dumped England out of the World Cup after just six days in Brazil . Roy Hodgson's side had been intimidated by Suarez in their Group D defeat at the Arena Corinthians . Weeks after the tournament, at a debrief with England’s coaches, Hodgson told his staff that they would go back to basics for the Euro 2016 qualification campaign. The old-school, British mentality was to make a return and for all the right reasons. Hodgson wanted England to be difficult to beat again. He spoke with assistant manager Ray Lewington and coach Gary Neville, telling them he wanted his new England team to have a more muscular presence on the pitch. Hodgson and Gary Neville had discussions on how they could have a more muscular presence on the pitch . The head coach wanted his team to be stronger, to concentrate on the physical characteristics of the game again after those humbling defeats against Italy and Uruguay, plus the dead rubber against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte. Hodgson was convinced his team had gone soft, playing to the gallery as the nation demanded a side that could keep possession and stamp their personality on games in the same way as Spain, Holland, France or Germany. The outcome, after Hodgson (right) claimed he wanted to ‘bottle what I’m seeing’ during their pre-tournament training camp at Vale de Lobo in Portugal, was elimination from the World Cup. Although Hodgson wanted his team to be slick and to pass the ball with purpose, he vowed that the rough would go with the smooth for the final two years of his contract. In November, when England renewed their rivalry with Scotland at Celtic Park, the coaching staff agreed unanimously that they emerged from the physical confrontation with the upper hand. Hodgson has introduced the tenacious qualities of Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph to the team, encouraging him to make the meaty challenges in the centre of the park. Hodgson wanted to add some extra steel to his England squad and it game in the form of Fabian Delph . Delph has impressed for England since making his debut for England against Switzerland in Basle . ‘I do like a tackle,’ he admitted on Sunday as England continued their preparations for the prestige friendly against Italy on Tuesday. Less than a year ago, when England played the Italians in the opening World Cup group game in Manaus, Hodgson’s defence could not lay a glove on the Azzurri. Something had to change. The test for this team, with this new rugged approach, is to travel to Turin and secure a result with a depleted team against a side ranked 10th in the world. Wayne Rooney was named England captain and has is eager to please Hodgson and his new strategy . Rooney was in the team against Italy last summer, out on the left in the World Cup opener as Hodgson attempted to accommodate Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge. Everyone has learned a lesson from that. The England captain is comfortable with the new approach, eager to please the manager after adopting a new strategy. So far, with seven successive victories since they exited the World Cup, it has worked. Rooney and England have enjoyed six successive victories since bowing out of the World Cup with a whimper . Rooney said: ‘You don’t want to go into games with teams enjoying playing against you, you want teams to look at England and think, “We know we have a tough game. It is going to be physically hard against them, we are going to have to defend and we are going to have to be good on the ball to keep the ball”. ‘It’s maybe not so much nasty, but being aggressive. Not in a bad way in terms of we are putting really hard tackles in, but we are getting up to the ball quickly, we are harrying teams and making them make mistakes. At the minute we have the tactics right.’ On Tuesday, when the players take the field in Turin, they will be met with the uncompromising Juventus trio of Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli in their favoured 3-5-2 formation. On Tuesday England face World Cup opposition Italy again as Hodgson's side travel to Turin . ‘Italy will be very good on the ball and there will be times when they are able to play out so we have to make sure we pick our moments right and not get picked off,’ added Rooney. ‘It is moving in a good direction. We are learning with every game since the World Cup, we are getting better and there is an excitement back about England.’ It is a bit early for that, but at least they have made a fresh start.","Post-World Cup Roy Hodgson reflected on a team that had been bullied .

"After two drama-filled defeats in a week to local rivals Aston Villa, victory over Stoke, the club he managed for seven years before they judged his work there to be done, was a welcome tonic for Tony Pulis. A fourth consecutive clean sheet at home and a first-half goal from Brown Ideye takes West Bromwich Albion to 13th and 11 points from the drop zone. When Pulis, the engineer of Crystal Palace’s great escape last season, took over in January they hovered just one point above the bottom three, offering little to inspire optimism among their fans. Now their place in the top tier looks secure. Stoke were aiming at a fourth win in a row for the first time since 2011 but Pulis halted their progress. He said: ‘It doesn’t mean any more to win over Stoke, I had a wonderful journey there and left them in a sound financial and good position and did wonderful things. Today was about West Brom getting the points.’ Brown Ideye scores the opening goal during the   match between West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City . Ideye's opener was the only goal of the game as West Bromwich Albion beat Stoke at the Hawthorns . Pulis praised the contribution made by Darren Fletcher, who arrived at The Hawthorns on a free transfer on January deadline day after a lengthy struggle with ulcerative colitis in his later years at Manchester United. ‘He’s been a fantastic signing,’ said Pulis. ‘A tremendous lad. His enthusiasm and energy levels are brilliant. I don’t know what illness it was but he looks as sprightly as any 20-year-old. I thought he and James Morrison [who partners Fletcher for Scotland] dominated the midfield.’ There were a few controversial moments, such as referee Michael Oliver’s decision to wave away what seemed a blatant penalty for Geoff Cameron’s hefty second-half challenge on Craig Dawson in the box. Oliver, who was praised for his officiating of Manchester United’s FA Cup defeat by Arsenal on Monday, is likely to get attention for different reasons after waving away penalty appeals, to Pulis’s obvious fury. ‘Michael will look at that again and be very disappointed, that’s a blatant a penalty as I’ve seen in a long time,’ he said. A beautiful cross into the box from Craig Gardner led to the goal in the 19th minute. It was expertly headed in at the far post by a stooping Ideye, who found it far too easy to escape the attentions of Phil Bardsley. Stoke had few chances and manager Mark Hughes lamented: ‘It was just one of those days when we had too many underperforming.’ Ideye celebrates as his first half goal earns the Baggies their fourth successive home win .

Brown Ideye's 19th minute header was enough to seal victory for West Brom. CLICK HERE to see more from our brilliant Match Zone service . Pulis, who was given the Manager of the Month award for February, has now won seven of 13 games since taking over and appears to have extracted extra oomph from Ideye. Or perhaps it was the threat of life in the Qatari desert that did it. West Brom were close to taking a £6m hit selling him to al-Gharafi but the 26-year-old refused the move and both parties must be glad of his stubbornness now. Ideye thought he had nicked another in the 33rd minute, pouncing after Begovic spilled the ball, but was rightly ruled offside. Ideye limped off in the 40th minute after being clattered by Charlie Adam but hobbled back on seconds later. Ben Foster also suffered a knock to the knee. He struggled on for a while with Chris Brunt stepping in to take free kicks but was eventually replaced by Boaz Myhill after 55 minutes. The deputy did his job well, tipping a Jon Walters header over the bar as a reenergised Stoke sought the equalizer. Referee Oliver, who was praised for his officiating of Manchester United’s FA Cup defeat to Arsenal on Monday, is likely to get attention for different reasons after waving away appeals for what appeared a blatant penalty for Cameron’s burly challenge on Dawson in the box.

Glenn Whelan challenges England youngster Berahino for the ball as the Potters look to get back into the game . After Jonathan Walters was substituted after a clash of heads with Dawson, momentum swung back the way of the hosts. A driving effort by James Morrison was tipped over by Begovic. It was the 82nd minute before Stoke got their second shot on target, Crouch’s tame effort easily collected by Myhill. The keeper again came to the rescue of his side, bringing down Crouch just outside the area when the striker was yomping towards the goal deep into injury time and was shown a yellow card. Stephane Sessegnon started for the first time for West Brom since their 1-0 win over Southampton where he was widely condemned for diving in an attempt to win a penalty. Manager Tony Pulis said he has not yet reprimanded the midfielder who he revealed had suffered a family bereavement in recent weeks. 'I’ve had a good chat with Steph,' said Pulis, as quoted by The Birmingham Mail, 'I don’t want to go into it but it’s a tragedy what has happened and I’ve left it with him to be honest. ‘He’s been a bit down in the dumps lately although he looked a bit brighter on Thursday in training.

"Theo Walcott has one message to send to rivals competing for his place in the England team: Bring it on. The Arsenal winger spent practically an entire year out for club and country, missing last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, and is only just easing himself into action. In his absence, Raheem Sterling has emerged as one of the nation’s best players, Danny Welbeck continues to play well for England and Harry Kane has raced into contention.

Walcott spent practically an entire year out for club and country, missing last summer’s World Cup in Brazil . Manchester United ace Wayne Rooney is a permanent fixture after being handed the England captaincy . With captain Wayne Rooney a permanent fixture on the team-sheet, England manager Roy Hodgson is not short of attacking options whatever formation he chooses to play. But Walcott said: ‘Bring it on. Competition is always going to be there anyway. I’ve been there from 17-years-old and I’ve manage to get through it now and then. ‘Competition is healthy. We want as a nation for all the players to be playing well. It’s only going to spur you on and make you a better player.’ Danny Welbeck, Rooney and Jack Wilshere celebrate scoring against Scotland at Celtic Park in Glasgow . Harry Kane has raced into England contention this season and earned a call-up to Roy Hodgson's squad . Kane scored less than two minutes into his England debut during the 4-0 win against Lithuania . Welbeck has continued to play well for the Three Lions despite failing to impress too many at club level . Walcott admitted he had ‘got a taste for it’ after coming on as a substitute for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and is hoping for more game time in the friendly with Italy. Spurs striker Kane also came on from the bench and continued his incredible rise this season by scoring 79 seconds into his England debut. Kane is still only 21-years-old, whereas Walcott was thrust into the spotlight four years earlier. And Walcott warned: ’You need to make sure it doesn’t go to your head. Looking at Harry he’s not that sort of guy. He's very nice and down to earth. But Walcott has warned Tottenham Hotspur striker Kane not to let it all go to his head . ‘Just play your football, that’s all you need to do. You don’t need to worry about anything else. You can see he’s playing with a smile on his face every day. You see it in training. As long as he continues to do that, the best will come from him.’ ‘He’s had a lot of experience in the Premier League already. Being top-goalscorer as well. It’s only going to make him into a better player. If he’ s right up there with the best, he’ll believe he is the best.

"Despite a raft of injuries, England are lucky enough to still be able to call on the goalscoring exploits of Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane ahead of their glamour friendly with Italy. But Italian centre back Giorgio Chiellini is more concerned about the presence of Theo Walcott, the Arsenal winger with just three goals this campaign who hasn't started for his country in over 18 months. Kane and Rooney have 50 goals between them this season, but Juventus star Chiellini picked out the 'terrifying' Walcott when asked which England players he admired most in the build-up to Tuesday's clash in Turin. Theo Walcott has been picked out by Giorgio Chiellini as the England player who can be most dangerous . Chiellini (second right) chose the 'terrifying' Walcott as the player he is the biggest fan of ahead of facing him . Walcott has struggled to find a place in the team for both Arsenal and England since returning from a knee injury that ruled him out for seven months and saw him miss last summer's World Cup. But Chiellini believes that England are foolish to ignore the player he sees as one of his biggest threats on Tuesday evening at the Juventus Stadium. 'I am always a fan of Walcott, a quick sprinter and terrifying for defenders,' Chiellini said. 'England notice his absence. For the world of football, it is positive that Walcott recuperates totally to his top level.' Italy beat England 2-1 in last summer's World Cup and also eliminated the Three Lions from Euro 2008 in a quarter-final penalty shoot-out. Walcott was used as a substitute in England's win over Lithuania but has struggled for game-time of late . Chiellini believes England are foolish to ignore the player he sees as one of his biggest threats on Tuesday . And Chiellini wants to make it three wins from three games against the English in a game he refuses to view as the friendly it has been billed as. 'This is not a friendly match because matches between England and Italy are always of interest to the whole world. 'England have pride and want to avoid defeat even though this is not an official competition. 'The match is not a comfortable one because our victory at the World Cup is still very present in the mind and perhaps their hopes of revenge will make this a very intense match.'

"West Brom boss Tony Pulis admits he takes great pride in Stoke's success under Mark Hughes because his successor is reaping the benefits of his own work at the Britannia Stadium. Pulis welcomes his former club to the Black Country on Saturday hoping to break Stoke's 100 per cent winning record at The Hawthorns. While the Baggies head into the match on the back of two frustrating defeats to local rivals Aston Villa in league and cup action, Stoke are looking for a fourth successive win and sit eighth in the Barclays Premier League. Tony Pulis admits he takes pride in seeing Stoke's success in the Premier League this season . While Pulis stopped short of claiming the credit for Stoke's current success, the Welshman was happy to point out his influence in their squad. 'The great thing for me about the club is that you leave it in a condition where it can grow and grow and get better,' he said. 'Look at the players who are there, the backbone of that football club, like Glenn Whelan, Ryan Shawcross, Asmir Begovic, Steven N'Nonzi, Peter Crouch, Jon Walters, just a few to mention. 'Marc Wilson, Geoff Cameron, wonderful people and wonderful professionals, and it's really nice when you take over a club with all good professionals like that.' He added: 'How many players has Mark brought in? 'I don't know but the majority of the lads who were there before still seem to be picked week-in week-out, that's testament to them as individuals to win over a new manager. Pulis takes credit for the 'backbone' of the Stoke side, which includes Ryan Shawcross (above) 'Glenn Whelan and Ryan Shawcross are the only ones who were there when we got promoted from the Championship.

"Albert Kelly scored two sensational 90-metre solo tries to help Hull KR shatter St Helens' 100 per cent record in Super League. The Australian half-back twice demonstrated exceptional pace to punish errors by the reigning champions to put the Robins on their way to a 24-22 win and leave Saints still looking for a first victory at Craven Park since 2008. Rovers, who claimed the scalp of Wigan last month, were good value for a third successive home win that rounded off a good day for the club after they earlier announced the notable acquisition of Jamie Peacock as football manager for 2016. Albert Kelly scored two sensational 90-metre solo tries . St Helens, who trailed 24-12 with with five minutes to go, could have snatched a point had former Hull KR co-captain Travis Burns been able to convert Jordan Turner's last-minute try but it would have been tough on the impressive Robins. Saints stay top of the table but they were a shadow of the side that beat Warrington a week earlier and coach Keiron Cunningham must now pick them up for their Good Friday derby at the DW Stadium. The champions were unfortunate to lose England hooker James Roby to injury but they made an ideal start when skipper Jon Wilkin, who began his professional career at Craven Park, re-gathered his own grubber kick to touch down and a goal from Burns made it 6-0 after just three minutes. It was all Saints for the opening quarter but Roby was held up over the line and Kelly twice punished their casual play to put his side in front. The former Gold Coast Titans scrum-half pounced on Wilkin's kick for his first long-range try and then picked off Burns' pass to outsprint the Saints cover for his second. Josh Mantellato converted both to put the Robins into a 12-6 lead but the champions were back level on 26 minutes when the ball was fed back from Wilkin's hoisted kick and Atelea Vea got Tom Makinson over at the corner. Burns landed the difficult conversion but Saints were forced to re-organise their team six minutes from half-time when Roby was forced from the field after taking a head knock. Lance Hohaia demonstrated his versatility by switching from full-back, where he began as third choice in the absence of Jonny Lomax and Paul Wellens, to hooker, with Makinson going to full-back. Rovers had a try disallowed when slow-motion replays indicated a knock-on by hooker Shaun Lunt after he re-gathered Terry Campese's kick but when St Helens winger Adam Swift again demonstrated his fallibility under the high ball his opposite number Ken Sio struck with the home side's third try two minutes before the break. The momentum was clearly with the Robins and Saints were forced to survive a torrid time in the third quarter. Mantellato was wide with a penalty attempt and then had a try disallowed after producing a flying finish at the corner only for slow-motion replays to reveal he was in touch. Kelly could have doubled his try tally following breaks by Lunt and Kris Welham but Rovers could not apply the finishing touches, and they had to settle for two successful Mantellato penalties to edge them 20-12 ahead. Hull KR thought they had sealed it when full-back Kieran Dixon went over for a fourth try on 64 minutes but Saints staged a tremendous late fightback which caused some anxious moments for Chris Chester's men. Forward Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook went over on 75 minutes - Burns' third goal cut the deficit to six points - and Turner took a return pass from Swift to go over four minutes later.","Albert Kelly scored two sensational 90-metre solo tries .

"Real Sociedad sporting director Loren has praised the work done by coach David Moyes since taking over the Spanish club in November. The former Manchester United manager replaced Jagoba Arrasate, who was sacked last year after a dismal start to the season left the Basque club in 19th place in La Liga. The 51-year-old Moyes has since led Real Sociedad away from the relegation zone and into ninth in the standings with 10 games of the season remaining. David Moyes has led Real Sociedad from the relegation places to mid table after taking charge in November . Real Sociedad striker Imanol Agirretxe celebrates after scoring in the win against Cordoba . 'It was hard for us to replace Jagoba,' Loren said in an interview with Spanish sports newspaper Marca. 'But the team needed to react and it certainly has done so. 'Our immediate aim has been achieved. 'I think the first thing that David (Moyes) did when he arrived was to try to give the team more solidness and consistency, and you can see that he has achieved that. 'The team is improving.' Moyes is under contract with Real Sociedad for another season. Moyes applauds the fans after leading Real Sociedad to their fourth win in five games . 'We were fortunate that a man that initially appeared inaccessible to Real Sociedad, ended up coming here,' Loren said. 'I believe he (Moyes) is giving a big contribution.' Loren believes the arrival of Moyes will open the door for the arrival of British players to the club in the near future. 'It's difficult to bring players from England, unless you have something that can attract the players,' Loren said.

'The Italian clubs know how to compete, that is the reason why they progress in Europe this year. They are quite aware of the tactics. They work together with different tactics and different systems so they know what to do. 'But I don't see England or the English players worse than them technically.

"Aaron Murphy scored two tries as Huddersfield ended their hoodoo against bogey side Warrington but it was Danny Brough who starred in the Giants' win. Brough provided the assist for both of Murphy's tries in a typically influential display and the talismanic stand-off also landed four conversions and a drop goal. Jamie Ellis, Jermaine McGillvary and Eorl Crabtree also crossed the whitewash for Huddersfield, who ended a run of 11 games without victory against Wolves going back to 2011. Huddersfield Giants' Aaron Murphy goes over for a try as Warrington Wolves' Kevin Penny attempts a tackle . The hosts welcomed back skipper Joel Monaghan from a two-match injury absence but Ben Harrison, Richie Myler, Gary Wheeler and brothers Ben and Rhys Evans were missing. Huddersfield brought back Anthony Mullally for Josh Johnson but were still without Chris Bailey, who missed the victory at Wakefield for family reasons. The Giants, whose confidence was boosted by three successive victories against Widnes, Castleford and Wakefield after three opening defeats, made a dream start with a try from Ellis. The scrum-half won the race to his own neat grubber kick to score under the posts after six minutes and Brough landed the conversion. Warrington missed a chance when Ben Currie lost the ball after Ryan Atkins had been held up over the line. Craig Kopczak is tacked by Daryl Clark . The Wolves increased the pressure but their own mistakes, a poor kicking game and dogged Giants defence kept Warrington at bay. Ben Westwood lost the ball trying to stretch over the line with Atkins then bundled into touch on the first tackle. Warrington prop Chris Hill and Giants second row Jack Hughes were involved in a skirmish before Huddersfield increased their lead with a trademark Brough drop goal just before the interval. Wolves were fortunate to be only 7-0 down at the break after a mistake littered first half. The lead was increased soon after the restart when Brough's kick bounced awkwardly for Stefan Ratchford and Murphy pounced to race over for a converted try and stretch the advantage to 13-0. Warrington finally broke the resolute Giants defence after 47 minutes when Chris Bridge, after a poor first half, broke through to send in Gareth O'Brien with an inside pass. O'Brien converted his own try and Mickey Higham almost forced his way over after Westwood was held short. Warrington briefly stepped up the tempo with a sizzling break from his own line by Ratchford setting up the chance for Monaghan to put Kevin Penny over in the corner and close the gap to 13-10 after 63 minutes. Brough was a constant threat to Warrington and another precision kick to the corner split the Wolves defence for Murphy to pounce for his second try and make it 17-10 with 13 minutes left. A touchline burst by McGillvary almost brought another try but his cross field kick just eluded Craig Kopczak. Huddersfield sealed victory five minutes from time when McGillvary intercepted Daryl Clark's pass to race 70 metres to touch down for their fourth try and the Giants still had time to add a final try through Crabtree.","Aaron Murphy scored two tries as Huddersfield ended their hoodoo .

"The final scoreline suggested otherwise. Yet for Gordon Strachan there were spells of a 6-1 thrashing of Gibraltar which felt like a form of misery. As rain and wind swirled around the National Stadium the Scots endured an unexpectedly jittery, uncomfortable first half. Gibraltar, a British Overseas territory of 30,000 residents rejected by FIFA and playing in their first UEFA qualification campaign, reacted to Shaun Maloney's opening penalty by equalising within 60 seconds. It was their first ever goal in a competitive international. Gordon Strachan praised the performance of Gibraltar after Scotland beat them 6-1 on Sunday . Lee Casciaro (second right) scored Gibraltar's first international goal 72 seconds after Scotland went ahead . Casciaro's goal sparked jubilant celebrations from Gibraltar's players as Hampden Park was stunned . 'I have to say that all the credit should really go to Gibraltar,' said Strachan afterwards. 'They made my life a misery for periods of that game. They made it a long game for me as a coach, so well done to them. 'But also well done to my players because there were players out there who personally weren't having a great game but they stuck at it. 'We had some good chances and never took them. It was nice to see Steven Fletcher score a hat-trick I thought he was one of our better players today.' Of late Fletcher has been the subject of unwelcome headlines. Pictured posing beside a £200,000 Lamborgini shortly after Sunderland had lost 4-0 to Aston Villa the striker had managed just four goals all season. At international level his last strike was in a 2-1 win over Iceland in April 2009. 'Some of his touches were lovely today,' said Strachan. 'I was wanting more balls in the first half played through but Maloney, Fletcher, Naismith were marked and wanted balls played through. 'We played square too many times because they were ready for it and wanted it. 'We have people who can turn so I was a wee bit disappointed with that as well. Striker Steven Fletcher (right) led Scotland to victory against Gibraltar with a hat-trick . Fletcher was recently mocked on Twitter for buying a Lamborghini after inconsistent form for Sunderland . Fletcher is the first Scotland player to score three goals in a game since Colin Stein in 1969 . 'To be fair the conditions were not great either. 'It was swirling out there. Andy Robertson and Ikechi Anya had problems with the swirling wind in the first half.' Robertson, the young Hull full-back was dragged out of position when Gibraltar' s Lee Casciano wrote himself into the annals in the 19th minute. Opting to play with a three-man defence – with just Russell Martin at the centre - Strachan admitted the system had worked less well than he anticipated. 'It did get us four goals, but I was expecting that system to work a lot better than that but the goal sort of threw us a bit. Within any system you are hoping your players will play to a level but in the first ten minutes we gave the ball away eight or nine times, that's too much at international level no matter who you are against.' The campaign comes down now to Ireland in Dublin on June 13, a huge game in every sense. Win at the Aviva and a play-off place – at least – becomes more likely than not. 'After five games and performances I am delighted with we are here and we have ten points, I think we are all happy with that. We can go into the second half of this group feeling quite good about ourselves. 'I look back at the performances and I think four so far have been terrific. 'This was not one of our best but we got through. 'We scored six goals and if we had woken up this morning and said we would score six we would have settled for that. 'I wouldn't have wanted the one against us, but that's the way football works some times. 'So it's been a good old day for everybody today. 'Gibraltar got their first goal and unfortunately David Marshall will always be that name now who is the subject of quiz questions everywhere.' Scotland boss Strachan (right) said he is delighted with 10 points from their first five qualifying games . Shaun Maloney scored two penalties for Scotland against Gibraltar at Hampden Park on Sunday . Everton striker Steven Naismith (right) was also on the scoresheet in a big win for Scotland . Despite the scoreline interm Gibraltar coach Davie Wilson can point to the goal his side scored as evidence of improvement. They host Scotland in the Algarve in the final round of fixtures and Wilson says: 'As a Scotsman, it's a horrible thought - but we might just be the ones who get the result that spoils my country's party.

"A Red Bull adviser has warned that the team could pull out of Formula One unless changes were made to the current regulations. Red Bull are among a number of teams frustrated by their inability to keep up with Mercedes, who dominated Formula One last year and cruised to an easy victory in Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix after a virtual procession. Rival drivers described the race as 'boring' and Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said if it went unchecked, it could drive other teams away and reduce interest in the sport. Red Bull may pull out of Formula One if the rules are not changed, an adviser has warned . Helmut Marko (left, with former Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel) says the team will evaluate the situation . Marko even suggested that Red Bull, who won four championships in a row before being left in the Mercedes slipstream, might pull out if billionaire owner Dietrich Mateschitz lost interest. Speaking to German-language media, Marko was quoted as saying: 'We will evaluate the situation again as every year and look into costs and revenues. 'If we are totally dissatisfied we could contemplate an F1 exit. 'Yes, the danger is there that Mr Mateschitz loses his passion for F1.' Daniel Ricciardo could only manage a sixth-placed finish for Red Bull during the Australian Grand Prix . Red Bull's second driver Daniil Kvyat pulled out of Sunday's opening race with a gear box failure . Marko's comments came after Red Bull team principal Christian Horner told reporters that Formula One officials should take action to equalise the engine performances of every team to create a more level playing field. Red Bull made a disastrous start to the new season with Daniel Ricciardo getting lapped before finishing sixth in his home race. His new Russian team-mate Daniil Kvyat didn't even make it to the grid, withdrawing before the start with gearbox failure. 'When we were winning, and we were never winning with an advantage that Mercedes has, double diffusers were banned, exhausts were moved, flexible bodywork was banned, engine mapping was changed mid-season - anything was done to pull us back,' Horner told reporters.

"New Zealand swing king Tim Southee says the Kiwis are ready to cut Australia down to size in the Cricket World Cup final on Sunday. Southee, who has taken 15 wickets for Brendon McCullum’s men in this tournament, insists his team are riding high on confidence and ready to upset their ‘big brothers’. As the co-hosts prepare to do battle at the MCG, Southee said: ‘The rivalry between Australia and New Zealand does cover every sport and is massive. Tim Southee is relishing the prospect of facing Australia in the World Cup final on Sunday . ‘We’re probably seen as the little brothers from across the ditch and we do quite well to compete. ‘Australia have had the wood on us in cricket over the last few years but we’re slowly starting to even that ledger. ‘But as a kid growing up it was always Australia you wanted to play against. ‘You always want to have one up over the big brothers.’ Before their thrilling victory over South Africa, New Zealand had lost each of their six World Cup semi-finals. But they have already beaten the Aussies in the outstanding match of the pool stage, with the Kiwis claiming a one-wicket win in Auckland. New Zealand practiced at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Friday in preparation for the final . McCullum’s enterprising team have sparked a sporting buzz which is normally reserved for the All Blacks, although the final will be their first away game of the competition. Expatriated Kiwis have travelled from all over the world to Melbourne, while Air New Zealand has chartered extra flights from Auckland. Southee (left) said: ‘We get to do what a lot of people that have gone before us haven’t been able to do, and they are now behind us. The support from back home has been amazing. I can’t explain what it’s like and what it has done for the team. Daniel Vettori will play his last ever ODI for New Zealand on Sunday in the World Cup final . ‘It’s a dream come true for all the guys. As a kid, you grow up either wanting to be an All Black or a Black Cap and the guys are very excited to fulfil a childhood dream. ‘Brendon speaks a lot about it being the time of our lives. We never want it to end. One more big push and I’m sure it’s something the guys will remember forever. ‘It doesn’t get any better than taking on Australia in Australia at one of the best cricket grounds in the world.’ Australia captain Michael Clarke admitted after his side’s semi-final victory over India that defeat to New Zealand last month was ‘a kick up the backside’. Clarke said: ‘The fact that the two hosting nations are in the final is extremely special. ‘There’s a great mutual respect between both teams. New Zealand will take confidence that they’ve beaten us in the tournament. ‘But that was the turning point in this tournament for the Australian team. ‘The boys have got out of bed every single day to try to become better and you’ve seen that in our results. We’ve been improving every game and that will hold us in really good stead.’ New Zealand batsman Kane Williamson practices his football skills during the training session in Melbourne .

"Fresh from leading his side to a 95-run over India in the World Cup semi-final, Australia captain Michael Clarke was temporarily stumped by a reporter's line of questioning during the post-match press conference. Flanked by team-mate Steve Smith, who hit 105 off just 93 balls to propel Australia to victory, Clarke fielded questions from the assembled media following his side's seismic victory. 'Michael you've had tremendous sex as Australia captain,' asked BBC reporter Stephan Shemilt before correcting himself and re-stating that he intended to say 'success'. Australia captain Michael Clarke (left) and Steve Smith are clearly amused by the bungled line of questioning . Steve Smith celebrates after running out Indian batsman Ravindra Jadeja during the World Cup semi-final . 'Interesting,' a clearly amused Clarke replied amid a chorus of laughter among the assembled press. 'You might have that as well I don't know,' replied Shemilt. 'How well do you know me. That's a question for my wife,' Clarke added, as Smith struggled to contain his laughter at the top table. Australia will face arch rivals New Zealand in Sunday's World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Smith whacks the ball for six runs during his innings of 105 from 122 balls as Australia set India 329 to win . Australia skipper Clarke reflects after missing a catch but it didn't prevent their victory . The Black Caps are the only unbeaten team of the tournament so far, having trumped Australia as well in the pool stages, but Clarke said told Sky Sports World Cup: 'We're playing some really good cricket at the moment. 'Losing to New Zealand gave us that kick up the backside. I still don't think we've played the perfect game yet. I think we've improved every game and now we're excited to be in the final. 'I think the boys have played some outstanding cricket. Smithy was exceptional once again. He's hitting the ball so sweetly, and I'm really proud of the execution under pressure there from our bowlers.' Mitchell Johnson jumps for joy after taking the wicket of India's Rohit Sharma for 34 runs . Smith's century comes in a tournament that has already seen him make scores of 95, 72 and 65, and the stand-in Test captain hopes there is plenty left in the bag for Sunday. 'Another big hundred would be nice,' he said. 'It's nice to contribute to a few wins. It was a pretty big stage, the semi-final of a World Cup. I'm just happy that we got over the line in the end.'","Australia beat India by 95 runs to advance to Cricket World Cup final .

This fashionable idea that foreign managers are better than English ones is a myth. ‘It’s like foreign players. They move to wherever they can earn the most money. They are not interested in living the dream for that club. ‘All the nonsense of kissing the badge and they are really only interested in kissing their bank balance.’ Bassett believes foreign players are more interested at kissing their bank balance than their side's crest .","Dave Bassett hits out at clubs who employ 'fashionable foreigners'

"Joe Hockey claims an article caused his family great distress, describing the moment his 'elderly and frail' father broke down in tears whilst speaking at a court appearance. The Liberal Politician told the Federal Court that he was 'devastated' when he saw the headline 'Treasurer for Sale' splashed across the front page of a major Fairfax newspaper. He said the headlines had caused his own family - including his elderly father - to question him. 'I was most concerned for my wife, and my children, and for my father,' he told the court, glancing out to the body of the courtroom, where his wife Melissa Babbage sat staring straight ahead, her heels crossed. 'A few days later my daughter asked me whether someone was trying to buy me,' Mr Hockey said. Scroll down for video . Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey (right) arrives at Federal Court with his wife Melissa Babbage (left) to give evidence in his defamation case against Fairfax Media . Sydney Morning Herald Editor in Chief Darren Goodsir outside the Federal Court at Joe Hockey's defamation case against Fairfax Media . Joe Hockey, pictured with his family, claimed his young daughter asked him 'whether someone was trying to buy me' 'The only thing you walk out of politics with is your reputation,' he continued. 'If, in the eyes of your own family, as there was in the phone call with my father, there's a doubt - a brief doubt - then what have you got?' 'He broke down in tears when I called him,' Mr Hockey claimed. Mr Hockey entered the witness box in Sydney on Monday afternoon to testify in his high-profile defamation suit against the publishing giant. The court action centres on stories run in Fairfax Media's flagship newspapers The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age last year under the headline 'Treasurer for Sale'. The Canberra Times used another headline. The stories examined a political fundraising body in Mr Hockey's electorate known as the North Sydney Forum, where members who paid an annual fee were able to meet with the treasurer at special events. Joe Hockey, pictured with his wife Melissa Babbage, revealed the distress an article caused his family whilst appearing in court on Monday . Mr Hockey has told the court he first became aware of the articles when he received a phone call from his press secretary shortly after midnight on May 5, 2014. When he awoke a few hours later he headed straight for his local newsagency in Canberra. 'I saw the front pages, I was stunned. And Matt the newsagent said, 'What's all this about?' I just shook my head,' Mr Hockey said. 'I went across to the bakery for one of their very ordinary cups of coffee and looked around, and the papers were everywhere.' Under questioning by his barrister Bruce McClintock SC, Mr Hockey said he felt 'absolutely devastated' at the suggestion he was corrupt. Earlier on Monday Mr Hockey's lawyers alleged that Fairfax published 'scurrilous and false allegations' against the treasurer in an act of petty spite.

Mr Hockey, pictured with his wife Melissa Babbage (left) outside the Federal Court on Monday, said the headlines had caused his own family - including his elderly father - to question him . Matthew Collins QC, for Fairfax, questioned Mr Hockey about a number of critical public comments he made on Twitter and elsewhere about political opponents including former Labor prime ministers Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, as well as Opposition Leader Bill Shorten. The court heard one tweet published on Mr Hockey's official account read: 'Access to Rudd, at a price... FACT'. 'Do you consider it part of the rough and tumble of political life to call your opponents hypocrites,' Dr Collins asked. 'As they do me,' Mr Hockey replied. Mr Hockey said he did not intend for the North Sydney Forum to be a fundraising vehicle for his re-election campaign and he did not have a hands-on role in setting up the organisation. 'The organisation's purpose was to establish a business networking forum,' he said. Shown a passage from the North Sydney Forum's website, which stated the Forum was 'vitally important to Joe's ongoing success and the development of effective Coaltion (sic) policy', Mr Hockey said: 'They've overplayed it. Massively overplayed it.' 'I wasn't intimately involved in the activities of the North Sydney Forum,' he added.

"England’s Young Lions booked their place in May’s Under 17 European Championship with an impressive 3-1 win over Slovenia at Chesterfield. John Peacock’s team, the defending European champions, surged into a three-goal lead by half-time courtesy of goals from Reece Oxford and Nathan Holland followed by an own goal by Matija Rom. Although Slovenia pulled a goal back through Jan Mlakar in the 65th minute, England were worthy winners and advanced to May’s finals in Bulgaria with a match to spare. England's Under 17 squad secured a place at the European Championships on Monday after beating Slovenia . Reece Oxfoed (centre) headed the England team into the lead after 20 minutes against Slovenia . Oxford (centre), the England Under 17 captain, celebrates putting his side ahead . England (4-2-3-1): Paul Woolston (Newcastle United); James Yates (Everton), Reece Oxford (C; West Ham United), Easah Suliman (Aston Villa), Jay DaSilva (Chelsea): Tom Davies (Everton), Daniel Wright (Sunderland); Nathan Holland (Everton), Chris Willock (Arsenal), Layton Ndukwu (Leicester City); Kazaiah Sterling (Tottenham Hotspur) Substitutions: Will Patching (Manchester City) for Willock 48; Marcus Edwards (Tottenham Hotspur) for Ndukwu 54; Lukas Nmecha (Manchester City) for Holland 64.

Scorer: Mlakar 65 . Boosted by Saturday’s 3-1 win over Norway at Burton-upon-Trent, England made the short trip north to Chesterfield full of confidence ahead of the second of three Elite Round qualifiers held this week. And they were soon on the offensive, with visiting goalkeeper Rok Vodisek pushing away a fierce shot from the Leicester striker Layton Ndukwu, who was chasing his fifth goal in Euro qualifying, inside two minutes. Slovenia, who had easily beaten Romania 3-0 in their first game of the qualifying mini-group on Saturday night, threatened when Timi Max Semic cut inside and forced England goalkeeper Paul Woolston into a low fingertip save. But England took the lead on 20 minutes and it was all the work of young Everton winger Holland. He helped win a corner with a purposeful run and then swung in a delivery that Oxford, the captain, headed into the top corner. Back came Slovenia and Newcastle stopper Woolston excelled with a one-handed save to keep out Jacob Novak’s thunderbolt. While the away side failed to take their chances, England were clinical and were in total command by half-time. Holland gained a goal that was just reward for his efforts on 36 minutes, playing a one-two with Arsenal man Chris Willock inside the box before drilling the ball into the bottom corner from 10 yards. And Holland was involved in the third too, which arrived two minutes later. Having advanced into space down the right, his cut-back was sliced by full-back Rom into his own net. Peacock was allowed the luxury to make changes in the second period and Manchester City duo Will Patching and Lukas Nmecha were given a run-out, as was Tottenham’s Marcus Edwards.

England's victory meant they qualified with five wins from five and still have a group game remaining . And the latter came close to scoring the fourth following some nifty footwork but his shot from a tight angle was blocked at the near post. Slovenia deserved something on the balance of play and pulled one back 15 minutes from time when Fiorentina man Mlakar, the skipper, looped home a back post header. But a comeback never looked likely and England complete their qualifying campaign against Romania at Burton on Thursday knowing their place in the finals is already rubber-stamped.","England Under 17 captain Reece Oxford scored as England beat Slovenia .

"The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) Congress held in Paraquay this week has given the first indication that the FIFA presidential election in May might not be a procession to Sepp Blatter’s fifth term in office. The confederation had been expected to give Blatter a unanimous vote of support. But the motion was never put to the 10 delegates, in the knowledge that it would not be fully backed. The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) Congress was held in Paraguay this week . There were signs that Sepp Blatter may not have the unanimous support of South America . CONMEBOL has long been a Blatter stronghold, but a number of the old guard have been replaced by football federation leaders, including President Juan Angel Napout, who won’t necessarily back Blatter at all costs. The significance of the CONMEBOL snub to Blatter is that it was the first confederation gathering since three genuine challengers —Prince Ali of Jordan, Belgium’s Michael van Praag and Portugal’s former world footballer of the year Luis Figo — declared their candidacy for the FIFA presidency. Blatter’s overwhelming shows of support in Asia and Africa occurred when the FIFA president wasn’t expected to face any realistic opposition. But all the challengers were in Asuncion, Paraquay on the campaign trail. All the challengers, including Luis Figo, were in Asuncion, Paraguay on the campaign trail . Radio 5 Live have made little ballyhoo of their considerable coup in having John Francome on their team for the Cheltenham Festival. Natural broadcaster Francome  has done no media work since leaving Channel 4 — where he has been hugely missed — after they changed their racing production company from Highflyer to IMG. BBC’s caution at promoting Francome’s exciting return is understood to be because 5 Live do not yet know how much time he will be available to work. Radio 5 Live have made little fuss of capturing John Francome for their team for the Cheltenham Festival . The disproportionate financial power of the clubs compared to the national ruling body is such that Mike Rigg — a key member of FA technical director Dan Ashworth’s staff at St George’s Park as head of talent identification — can be attracted away to become chief football officer at Championship strugglers Fulham by the offer of nearly four times his FA salary. The FA’s £1.5m-a-year official beer brand deal with Budweiser for the FA Cup until 2018 at least gives them small respite from the scrutiny around their year-long failure to land a lead sponsor — ironically to replace Budweiser — for the most famous club knockout competition in football. The Budweiser contract will also give them exposure on the interview backboards for the quarter-finals at the weekend which were giving the impression that William Hill, the betting partner, were the main sponsor. The FA have a new £1.5m-a-year official beer brand deal with Budweiser for the FA Cup until 2018 . The England Cricket Board are now faced with a number of counties believing the Sky monopoly of cricket must end, with more of the game shown on terrestrial TV to help address falling participation. So, in their wisdom, the ECB have appointed Sky Sports greatest disciple Chris Haynes as their new director of communications — as Sports Agenda predicted. During 24 years as a Sky spokesman, Haynes was seemingly programmed only to be super-positive about his employers. Cheltenham’s former sponsorship chief Peter McNeile fell on his sword two years ago. It came after he told a reporter the Jockey Club, which own the course, were seeking a single, bluechip sponsor from outside the betting industry for three of its top races, including the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Yet all four of the marquee races at the Festival still have bookmaker names attached to them. A Jockey Club spokesman said Cheltenham had three new sponsors from outside the betting industry and were pleased with the portfolio.

"The national headquarters of Sigma Alpha Epsilon have launched an investigation into the fraternity's chapter at Louisiana Tech University after two former members came forward to say they heard the racist 'there will never be a n***** SAE' chant sung there, as well. The Louisiana Tech chapter is the third SAE house accused of using the horrifying song that was sung by members of the fraternity at the University of Oklahoma over the weekend. On Wednesday, the president of the University of Texas said he had ordered an investigation into claims brothers at SAE in Austin had used the tune. The fraternity headquarters is investigating in Texas, as well. The vile song 'there will never be a n***** SAE' was sung at the fraternity's chapter at Louisiana Tech University in 2010 and 2011, a former pledge and a former member claim . SAE is also investigating reports that the song was used at the SAE chapter at the University of Texas-Austin . According to BuzzFeed, one former members of the fraternity and one former pledge both said they had witnessed the racist chant in 2010. The former SAE member, who remained anonymous, said he had heard it at least a dozen times in 2010 and 2011. 'The chant was never taught to us during our official pledge education. It was taught in private,' the former SAE said. He added that the university didn't make up the song, claiming it had been 'going around' the fraternity for years. Louisiana Tech administrators told BuzzFeed on Thursday that they had met with leaders of SAE there and warned them that they had 'zero tolerance' for racist behavior. The shocking racist song has been circulating the SAE fraternity at OU for at least three years, trustees said . Dylan Merriman, who was an SAE pledge, told BuzzFeed he was at a party at the fraternity when a drunken brother chanted 'there will never be a n***** SAE.' Merriman said the member then pointed at a picture of his SAE brother and exclaimed, 'There was never a n-word in this chapter and there never will be.' Merriman said he left the fraternity not long after the incident. SAE spokesman Brandon Weghorst confirmed Thursday investigations into chapters at the University of Texas-Austin and Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. Weghorst says none of the allegations have been substantiated, and the UT chapter is being 'fully cooperative.' He says the Louisiana Tech probe is still in its early stages. Late Wednesday, the board of trustees and alumni of the University of Oklahoma's SAE chapter acknowledged in a statement the chant surfaced at the chapter 'three to four years ago.' OU President David Boren said the university is investigating fraternity members to determine their 'level of responsibility.'","Former member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon at Louisiana Tech University said he heard the racist song a dozen times in 2010 and 2011 .

"Manchester United have handed a trial to Glossop North End youngster Sam Grimshaw. The 21-year-old can play at left-back or as a left-sided winger and has impressed with performances in the North West Counties League this season. Grimshaw spent nine years at neighbours Manchester City and has attracted attention from scouts at other league clubs too this season. Sam Grimshaw (right) has been handed a trial with Premier League giants Manchester United . Grimshaw will train with  United this week, and hopes to earn a place in Warren Joyce's Under 21s . Reece James has recently been loaned out to Huddersfield Town, and United are keen to boost their ranks . Grimshaw can run 100m in under 11 seconds, and is set to spend this week training at United who are keen to boost their U21 squad having loaned out Reece James to Huddersfield Town. If Grimshaw were to sign for United, he would not be the first ex-City youth player to join the club. Earlier this year, the Old Trafford club signed Sadiq El Fitouri on an 18-month deal. El Fitouri was recommended to the club by Paul Scholes and Phil Neville while playing for Salford during a match against United's Under 21s. In addition, United gave a trial to Southport's Andrew Lewis last month, while Bolton defender Andy Kellett joined on loan for the season. Sam Grimshaw started his footballing career at Manchester City, playing in their youth team for nine years. From there, he moved to Altrincham's youth set-up, where he captained the side on a number of occasions. He signed first-team forms in October 2012, before moving out on loan. He spent two spells at Radcliffe Borough in the Northern Premier League Division One North, before leaving Altrincham. He moved to Glossop North End, who have previously played in English football's top flight but now reside in the North West Counties League. He helped the team win their FA Vase semi-final match against St Austell on Saturday (setting up a Wembley final), and has now been rewarded with a trial at Manchester United.

"The race for places in the Champions League among the Premier League's top clubs has just become more urgent after UEFA announced significant increases in prize money for their top competition from next season. Cash for appearing in the group stages onwards is leaping by up to 50 per cent, and for English clubs there will also be steep hikes in 'market pool' money from UEFA's TV incomes. The upshot is that if an English club were to win next season's Champions League, they would earn around €100m (or £74m at today's exchange rates) from central UEFA funds alone. Ticket income plus any commercial bonuses income would be on top. Real Madrid's financial reward for retaining the Champions League would be even bigger than last year . Chelsea's Champions League exit at the hands of PSG has cost them a share of more lucrative prize money . To put that in context, England's highest-earning club in last season's Champions League was Manchester United, who earned €44.8m (£33m) from UEFA for reaching the quarter-finals. As things stand, the four Champions League slots for next season are filled by Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United - with that quartet the favourites to reach Europe's top club competition. But Liverpool in fifth, Southampton in sixth and Tottenham in seventh will still hold out hopes they can finish strongly and perhaps squeak into the top four. Never has that fourth place been so lucrative. Under current prize money arrangements, clubs reaching the group stage receive €8.6m (£6.4m) each plus €1m (£750,000) per group win and €0.5m (£370,000) per draw. The basic fee will rise 40 per cent to €12m (£8.9m) and each win will jump 50 per cent to €1.5m (£1.1m). Prize money for reaching the last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals will leap up to 57 per cent, respectively to £4m, £4.44m and £5.2m. The prize for being tournament runner-up will jump from €6.5m (£4.8m) to €10.5m (£7.8m) while the winner's prize will jump from €10.5m (7.8m) to €15m (£11.11m). Danny Welbeck will have extra reason to celebrate if Arsenal qualify for the Champions League next season . Manchester United won £33m after losing their quarter-final last year - but that will soon look relatively small . Brendan Rodgers and Raheem Sterling will now be even more desperate to finish in the top four this term . Manchester City flopped again among Europe's elite, but they are set for another windfall next season . The most any team will be able to win will from 'basic' prize cash - before TV market share cash - will jump from €37.4m (£27.7m) to €54.5 (£40.4m), a hike of 46 per cent. Yet it is the market pool money that promises to surge for English clubs especially, because BT Sport's £897m three-year deal with UEFA for all European club football kicks in next season, and is worth double what Sky previously paid. A lot of the increase, if not all, will filter to the English clubs in the Champions League. Last season the four English clubs shared around €70m (£52m) in market pool cash, on top of performance cash, with United getting most, at €24m (£17.8m). From next season, the total sum to English clubs is expected to leap by between 50 and 75 per cent, to between €105m (£78m) and €125m (£93m), with exact amounts to be confirmed. The biggest single English earner could get as much as €40m (£30m) of that pot alone, and more if only three clubs made it to the group stages. Sevilla won the Europa League last season, and Europe's second-tier club competition is getting a cash boost . The likes of Tottenham will benefit from the extra Europa League cash, if they do not finish in the top four . Whichever way the sums are calculated, being in the Champions League is about to become hugely more lucrative for English teams in particular. Prize money for the Europa League will also rise but it will remain very much the junior club competition. Currently for every pound UEFA give in prize money to Europa League clubs, Champions League clubs get £4.30. From next season the ratio will narrow to 3.3 to 1 from 4.3 to 1. But the highest-earning club in the lesser tournament will still only be able to earn a maximum of €15.3m (£11.3m). 'UEFA is really pleased that the new distribution system not only provides for a substantial rise in monies received by clubs participating in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League, but also strengthens UEFA's solidarity principle, namely ensuring an even more substantial increase in solidarity payments to clubs,' said UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino. 'In this way, the new system provides a better deal for everyone, especially those clubs which did not qualify to the group stage of either of the two UEFA club competitions. This is a perfect example of the proper implementation of the solidarity principle which forms an essential part of UEFA's key values.'","Champions League prize money has been boosted by UEFA .

"The United States held on for 1-1 draw with Switzerland in an international friendly on Tuesday after veteran forward Jozy Altidore was sent off. Brek Shea's curling free-kick gave the Americans a deserved goal on the stroke of halftime, and yet another lead to take into a second period. But the trend of coach Jurgen Klinsmann's team to concede late goals continued after Altidore was shown two yellow cards in the 68th minute, for a foul and then verbal abuse at Italian referee Luca Banti. Switzerland's Valentin Stocker prods in a late equaliser to earn a 1-1 draw with the USA . Stocker returns to the centre circle with Swiss team-mates after netting an 80th minute equaliser .

Swiss pressure paid off in the 80th when substitute Valentin Stocker scored from just two yards past debutant goalkeeper William Yarbrough. The U.S. has now been outscored 12-1 in the second half of matches since the World Cup. A leveler had seemed increasingly inevitable, and five minutes earlier another Swiss substitute, Pajtim Kasami, header over an open goal from close range. The U.S. also escaped in the 79th when an attempted clearance by defender John Brooks rolled just wide of his own goal. Stocker struck when the ball dropped to his feet after two U.S. defenders challenged for a left-wing cross, leaving him unmarked in front of goal.

The Americans never threatened Switzerland's goal after Altidore's rush of blood midway through the second half, first fouling left-back Francois Moubandje then complaining about his yellow card. Earlier, Shea's strike was out of character with a first half of miscues in front of goal. Though the U.S. was the better side, Switzerland was responsible for the best chance and most glaring miss in the 39th. Xherdan Shaqiri was freed down the left wing by a raking, diagonal pass from Fabian Frei and the playmaker's pass across the goalmouth was met with an air kick by Admir Mehmedi from four meters (yards). All the Americans' best work involved Alejandro Bedoya exploiting Swiss left-back Francois Moubandje, playing just his third international match. Twice Bedoya crossed invitingly from the right, but Gyasi Zardes blazed a left-foot volley high and wide in the 15th and Michael Bradley fired well over in the 26th when the Nantes winger cut the ball back from the byline.

Swiss star Shaqiri mostly drifted out of the game and blazed a long-range shot too high after collecting goalkeeper Nick Rimando's poor clearance in the 17th. Buerki's footwork was unimpressive for Shea's goal and the `keeper was at fault again in the 49th, failing to challenge Zardes for a header which bounced wide of the goal.

"England look set to play friendlies against France, Spain, Germany and Holland should they qualify for Euro 2016. Provided England reach the European Championship - and there is no suggestion they will fail to do so after winning their first five games - they will have a window for two friendlies in November, when the third-placed teams will be involved in play-offs. The Football Association is looking to give England a real test during that period by taking on France at Wembley on November 17 and it then hopes to set up a friendly in Spain later that month. Roy Hodgson has confirmed that England want to play friendlies against France, Spain, Germany and Holland . An FA spokesman confirmed on Tuesday England had agreed to play a friendly against world champions Germany in March. The FA is also in discussions with its Dutch counterparts about facing the World Cup semi-finalists prior to the tournament, which takes place in France.

"They are known as man's best friend, who will stay loyal to the end. But as this heartbreaking video shows, dogs are just as loyal to their own - even when put in a dangerous situation.

Last month, a dog called Cissy hit the headlines, when she disappeared from her yard in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, only to show up about 20 blocks away at Mercy Medical Centre. Her owner, Nancy Franck, has been at the hospital for the last two weeks, after undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. In August 2014, loyal dog Tommy refused to leave the graveside of his owner Bhaskar Shri, 18, for two weeks after he died in a car accident.

"Moments after announcing his imminent change of codes, Kevin Sinfield was asked if he had ever played a game of rugby union before. ‘No,’ he said, emphatically. There was a pause, as if the league icon was trying to fathom whether the question had been a joke, before he added: ‘They don’t play much rugby union in Oldham.’ That is undoubtedly true, but the current England fly-half, George Ford, also grew up in the Lancashire town, as did his Bath team-mate, Kyle Eastmond. Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season . Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012 . Now, at the age of 34, Sinfield is aiming to follow those younger converts across the rugby divide, having opted to leave Leeds Rhinos at the end of their season, to join sister club Yorkshire Carnegie. The former England captain is a record-breaking legend in the 13-man game, but he wanted one last career challenge; a late shot at union. ‘It’s something that excites me and I’ve wanted to do for a long time, but I never thought that I would get the chance to do it,’ he said, shortly after informing his Rhinos team-mates of his impending move. ‘The club has set targets to get back to where it belongs in the Premiership and that is something I want to be part of. ‘I didn’t want to get to the end of my career and look back with regrets about missed opportunities. So when this opportunity came up, my gut was telling me it was the right thing. Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . ‘I’m very respectful of the game (union) and I like watching it. A lot of rugby league people look down on union and a lot of rugby union people look down on league, but I like both games. As a sportsman, the opportunity to play another professional sport really appeals to me.’ Sinfield has no intention of making life easy for himself, when he tries to translate his enduring talents to union. Many of the converts who have fared best have been outside backs such as Jason Robinson, but his hope is to occupy the primary decision-making role. ‘I’d very much like to play fly-half – that’s the position that would suit my skills-set the best,’ he said. ‘I understand the challenge that is in front of me; the difficulties that rugby league players have faced coming over.’ Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge . Sir Ian McGeechan was present for the announcement in Leeds, in his role as Yorkshire Carnegie’s executive president, and the man synonymous with the Lions appeared visibly elated about the Championship club’s recruitment of such a pedigree figure, on an 18-month deal. ‘This is fantastic news,’ he said. ‘It is a great opportunity to get someone of Kevin’s quality, not just as a player but as a captain and someone who is an exceptional role model. ‘There was a change of ownership at Yorkshire Carnegie at Christmas and the ambition is for Premiership rugby. To have Kevin involved is a great acquisition for us and a statement of intent. We’ve got a lot of young men willing to learn from a natural leader. I for one am very excited.’","Kevin Sinfield has announced he is leaving Leeds at the end of the season .

The veteran stopper said recently: 'I don't know what the club's idea will be. It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo. 'But that can work for one season only. I don't want another one like this,' he added while on international duty for the Czech Republic who play Latvia in a Euro 2016 qualifier in Prague on Saturday.' Petr Cech joined Chelsea in 2004.

"The Premier League Golden Boot is one of the most sought-after individual prizes in the game - and this season’s competition is delicately poised for the final run-in. The three main contenders - Chelsea’s Diego Costa on 19, Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane on 19 and Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero on 17 - are all in with a chance of winning it. Will it go down to form? Will it be rocked by injury and suspension? Will it have the fairytale conclusion that so many would love to see? Sportsmail takes a look at the runners and riders in the race for the Golden Boot... The race for the Golden Boot seems to be between Harry Kane (left), Diego Costa (centre) and Sergio Aguero . Left foot: 5 . Right foot: 10 . Head: 4 . Minutes per goal: 98.26 . Harry Kane, Tottenham Hotspur . Can Harry Kane’s whirlwind season continue right until the end or will it run out of air? His hat-trick against Leicester in Tottenham’s last league match just goes to show how quickly the goalscorers chart can change as he leapt to catch Diego Costa within the space of 90 minutes. Ultimately, any Englishman and most neutrals would want to see Kane top at the end of the campaign, regardless of which team they support, given his story. Kane’s main downfall will be his lack of experience. Hopefully his youthful exuberance will not fade into nervous tension. Costa, 26, and Aguero, 26, are seasoned experts compared to the 21-year-old, more aware of what is required to find the back of the net after a long campaign when the thighs ache and the quads burn. Tottenham Hotspur's Kane was 500/1 to be the Premier League's top goalscorer at the start of the season . Burnley (A) (scored 1 goal against) Aston Villa (H) 1 . Newcastle United (A) 1 . Southampton (A) Manchester City (H) Stoke City (A) Hull City (A) 1 . Everton (A) Record against remaining teams: scored against 4/8 (four goals total) This zonal map shows where Kane scored his 19 goals this season for Tottenham in the Premier League . This pitch view map shows where Kane scored his goals from around the 18-yard box for Tottenham . Left foot: 5 . Right foot: 11 . Head: 3 . Minutes per goal: 102.42 . Diego Costa, Chelsea . The snarling, street-fighting Chelsea striker is joint-top of the goalscorers chart, but has played fewer games to reach his total goals tally and has one more to play than his two main rivals. Forget Kane and Aguero, however, Costa’s main adversary is himself. His aggressive style of play means he is the most likely of the three to pick up a suspension. He is already on eight domestic yellow cards for the season and was retrospectively banned for three matches for a stamp on Liverpool’s Emre Can. Chelsea also have a tougher run-in than Tottenham and Manchester City. They still have to face Manchester United and Liverpool at home and Arsenal away. Having said that, Costa has already scored against Arsenal and Liverpool this season and is yet to face United who have had an unstable defence. Chelsea striker Costa is among the best signings of the season and has 19 goals in the Premier League . Stoke City (H) Queens Park Rangers (A) Manchester United (H) Arsenal (A) (scored 1 goal against) Leicester City (A) 1 . Crystal Palace (H) Liverpool (H) 1 . West Bromwich Albion (A) 1 . Sunderland (H) Record against remaining teams: scored against 4/9 (four goals total) This zonal map shows where Costa scored his 19 goals this season for Chelsea in the Premier League . This pitch view map shows where Costa scored his goals from around the 18-yard box for Chelsea . Left foot: 4 . Right foot: 13 . Head: 0 . Minutes per goal: 107.53 . Sergio Aguero, Manchester City . He is the rank-outsider, but one who you would bet against at your peril. Aguero is trailing the other two by two goals, but he has scored four in one game this season, against Tottenham who he will face again in City’s remaining eight games. Of the three strikers, Aguero is by far the best finisher who can conjure a goal, or two, from nowhere in a game. He has already scored eight times against the last eight teams City have to face - the same amount as Costa and Kane’s record put together in their last fixtures of the season. Injury will be Aguero’s main concern. The knee injury he suffered in December cost him a month out and he has failed to consistently string together games  since he moved there four years ago. Manchester City striker Aguero has 17 goals and is just two behind the leading Premier League goalscorers . Crystal Palace (A) Manchester United (A) (scored 1 goal against) West Ham (H) Aston Villa (H) 1 . Tottenham Hotspur (A) 4 . Queens Park Rangers (H) 2 . Swansea City (A) Southampton (H) Record against remaining teams: scored against 4/8 (eight goals total) This zonal map shows where Aguero scored his 19 goals this season for City in the Premier League . This pitch view map shows where Aguero scored his goals from around the 18-yard box for City . My Golden Boot Guestimate… . This is, obviously, no exact science. You can analyse all the statistics, numbers and records in the world and the enigma of chance will always rear its head. For example, Costa has scored more of his goals, eight, against teams currently sitting from sixth to 10th, but only plays one of those, Stoke. Kane has netted eight of his strikes against teams now in the bottom five, and has two of those, Aston Villa and Burnley, remaining. Conversely, Aguero has a more even spread against teams throughout the table. And Aguero has a far better early-season record against City’s last teams than the other two. But then Aguero has not scored in five games, Costa has two in last two and Kane six in his last four. My heart says Kane, but my head goes with Costa, so I choose the Chelsea man.

"Harry Kane's impact on Friday night was extraordinary. What a delight it was to see a young Englishman, who is leading the Premier League scoring charts, come on and score for England within 79 seconds. Like everyone at Wembley, I left the ground with a smile on my face because of Kane’s cameo appearance. But we do have to measure our praise a little bit. On Friday against Lithuania he was facing a League One back four. To judge Harry properly you need to see him over 10 international games — and probably 10 back-to-back games. He needs those games to settle in and see what international football is about. Harry Kane (left) scored 79 seconds into his England debut against Lithuania on Friday . Kane wheels away to celebrate scoring for England against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday . Kane's incredible rise continued on Friday when he marked his first England game with a goal . What I will say is that from what I’ve seen of him over the past 12 months, stepping up from Under-21 level to the Tottenham first team, to the Europa League and now to full international level, he has looked comfortable at every stage. He can hold the ball up, he leaps well to head the ball, he works hard and can play in either of the front two positions and his finishing doesn’t really need any additional comment. He can be a genuine international player but we have to see him against tougher defences first. If he starts against Italy on Tuesday, it will be more of a test both on the pitch and mentally. On Friday, when he came on, there was nothing to lose. The game was won and their back four, which was struggling anyway, had been stretched. That’s a lovely position to be in as a fresh, young striker. When you start the focus is all on you and the team is looking to you for the breakthrough goals. That’s a different test. And he’s likely to be up against Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini, two of the toughest defenders around. I do believe that he will learn quickly and he can raise the bar at international level. Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge will both enjoy playing with him. I’ve said before that we haven’t had this range of attacking talent since I was the England manager and had to pick between Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham, Michael Owen, Ian Wright, Les Ferdinand, Robbie Fowler and Andrew Cole. There are some great options for Roy now. We’re not going to mess around any more with Rooney playing out wide. But I can see Rooney and Kane playing up top together, with one dropping in behind at times. Both of them can do that, so you can rotate the role. I had the same kind of pleasant problem going into the 1998 World Cup. We knew Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham could play together and they had a wonderful balance to them, with Teddy dropping in and Alan always playing close to the goal. But then Michael Owen burst on the scene with his lightning pace. I didn’t want Alan to play in the pocket if he played alongside Michael, because that’s not his best position. So we had to work at the system so that both of them would have little spells where they would be up top: Michael because of his pace and Alan because of his goal threat. If you look at Michael’s famous goal against Argentina, he comes from deep. That’s because he had dropped in for that period of the game and that was something we had specifically worked on. I didn’t want a 4-4-2 with two strikers playing square because, at international level, that’s food and drink to defenders. Kane headed in England's fourth against Lithuania shortly after replacing Wayne Rooney . It has been queried how Kane (left) would fit in a starting line-up alongside captain Wayne Rooney . Kane and Rooney in the same starting line-up could see formation turn to a 4-3-3 . The attacking full backs, Leighton Baines and Nathaniel Clyne, would be able to provide width to the attack . I think Rooney and Kane can do that, so that when we’re in possession it naturally changes into a 4-3-3, with the wide men pushing high. And if they stay up square of each other, the two wide men can come back down and the full-backs can get overlaps on them. That should happen so you’re changing your shape constantly. It also gives your wide player the opportunity to come inside and, although he can’t play on Tuesday, Danny Welbeck did that fantastically on Friday, driving into the box. He is going to win so many penalties doing that because he’s flying at people and throws defenders off their guard. And with Raheem Sterling, Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to add to the mix, it really does feel like a great period for English forwards. Give Harry a bit of time and there’s no reason to think he can’t be an important part of that. It is not just Harry Kane who we have to be careful not to overpraise. We need to be realistic about this England team, too. The qualifying campaign is telling us very little about whether Roy Hodgson’s team have progressed since the World Cup. We’re in control of the games and dominating possession. But we need to know how to play when we don’t have the ball and whether we can keep possession under pressure. We’re not really going to know if they’re good enough until June 2016. Friendlies won’t give us a real idea, as teams like Italy will be chopping and changing. Roy Hodgson is refusing to get carried away with the hype that is surrounding Kane . Danny Welbeck (left) produced a man-of-the-match display in England's win against Lithuania . Raheem Sterling (left) scored his first England goal in the victory over Lithuania on Friday . As the World Cup demonstrated, if you’re a little bit short, two years of work can all be over in 180 minutes of football. There’s nothing like a tournament to apply some cold reality. I think Gary Cahill is a really good defender but he and Phil Jagielka struggled against Italy and Uruguay at the World Cup. We don’t know whether that weakness is still there. And we don’t have the depth of defenders, because Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and John Stones haven’t seized their chance yet. Our wide forward players like Danny Welbeck and Raheem Sterling look great but they don’t have to defend that much. The problem will come when they get dragged back against much better sides. And let’s see how well the full-backs stand up when they are put under pressure. It was down that left side with Welbeck and Leighton Baines that Italy caught us out in the World Cup. Phil Jones (left) started alongside Gary Cahill in defence for England against Lithuania . Danny Welbeck (second right) celebrates England's second goal with Gary Cahill and Raheem Sterling . If England have less of the possession against Italy on Tuesday it would be probably be beneficial in the long term. We won’t have been used to playing without the ball. Major international tournaments are like being an Olympic athlete who has to be ready for a few days of competition every four years. Let’s hope England are up to the Olympic standard because we’re only going to find out next June.","Harry Kane scored on his England debut against Lithuania on Friday .

"We all have those days when nothing seems to go right and it appears it's the same for the animal kingdom too. In this case, a raccoon was seen having a string of bad luck after it was chased up a tree only to fall into a pond of cold water. The  moment of misfortune occurred when the cute critter crept inside a lemur enclosure at the North Carolina Zoo. The inhabitants did not take well to their unwelcome guest and it was forced to take refuge in a nearby tree. After waiting for the coast to clear, the stripy creature then attempted to get higher but ended up losing its grip on the way down. It was then captured plunging into a pond below before clambering out looking rather bedraggled. Bemused zoo visitors then watched the raccoon shiver on the sidelines as it attempted to dry off in the springtime sun. Get out!

"It's Kim Kardashian's world - we just play in it. On Tuesday Kim took to Twitter to reveal what her close friend and former editor-at-large for Vogue magazine, Andre Leon Talley, would look like in digital form.

Upgrade: Andre Leon Talley is a longtime friend of Kim Kardashian speaking his mind when it comes to fashion . Close: André Leon Talley is the former American editor-at-large for Vogue magazine . Andre will most likely be pleased with his new likeness in Kim's game, as the front-row regular has previously spoken about his long-time struggle with weight. 'The people who are really close to me and know me have stopped bringing my weight up,’ he told Vanity Fair in August 2013. ‘They probably still discuss it behind my back, some of them, in the fashion world.' After undergoing surgery, where Andre received a lap band that has not worked, he said he no longer weighs himself. 'I do not want to get on that scale. I only know what I weigh from the way my clothes fit,' he said. 'I have never felt less of a person because of my dramatic weight gain. Up or down, my confidence and sense of self never wavered.'

"Being locked up in prison cuts a person off from every aspect of everyday life, including intimacy with a partner. But if a couple are married, in may countries the inmates are allowed are allowed conjugal visits from their husband or wife. In 2007, Romania changed their penal laws to allow such visits and built bedrooms in their prisons for the liaisons to take place. Romanian photographer Cosmin Bumbut has travelled his country taking pictures of conjugal visit rooms in prisons, like this image of Iași prison, which he took in 2011 . Romanian photographer Cosmin Bumbut has spent the last few years photographing these rooms at 35 different jails across the country. He has now published the collection of images in a new exhibition called Camera intimă (The Intimate Room), which has been shortlisted for the Sony World Photography Awards in the Architecture section. Cosmin told FEMAIL that the Romanian prison system has changed a lot over the last decade. He said: 'Once Romania joined European Union, in 2007, the prison system was reformed; the biggest change was to introduce the right to private visits.' Aiud prison, 2008 . A woman's prison in Târgșor, 2011 . Bistrița prison, 2011 . He continued: 'A prisoner who is married has the right to receive, every three months, a two-hour private visit which takes place in a separate room inside the prison compound.' The project developed by chance while Cosmin was taking photos for a separate collection on prisoners in the Romanian city of Aiud in 2008. He was taking shots of a man and his wife during a conjugal visit and realised that the rooms would make an interesting series on their own. Gherla prison, 2011 . Arad prison, 2013 . Oradea prison, 2013 . Cosmin said: 'In 2008, I took the first photos inside the intimate room with an inmate and his wife after their private visit. 'I realised that these rooms represent the institutionalisation of love, the cancellation of tenderness. 'In 2011, I started photographing the intimate rooms systematically until 2014. 'I shot the rooms and some absurd details and also some footage from the point of view of the inmate lying on the bed.' Chilia Veche prison, 2013 . Juvenile detention centre in Tineri, Bacău, 2011 . Satu Mare prison, 2011 . Botoșani prison, 2011 . Cosmin added that although many prisons have got to the effort of making the rooms appear relatively warm, they are all tinged with sadness. He said: 'In this cold space, with information about STDs and safety hung on the walls, two people meet their loved ones, after months of waiting.'

"The president of the University of Oklahoma has condemned the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity for the racist chant that emerged this weekend and vowed to discipline the students involved - but stopped short of saying they would be expelled from the university. David Boren expressed outrage today at the racist song by members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and revealed that school officials have already identified at least two of the students seen singing 'There will never be a n***** in SAE' on a party bus over the weekend. 'We will look at all possible punishment and what is available to us under the law. Under the civil rights law it may be possible for us to take action against certain individuals,' he said. 'Would I be happy if they left voluntarily? Yes. We don't have room for racists and bigots here.' He added: 'I don't want them here. I'll pay the bus fare to get them out. They're not coming back.'

In a statement, he said that the members of SAE have until midnight Tuesday morning to clear everything out of the fraternity house. 'Effective immediately, all ties and affiliations between this University and the local SAE are hereby severed. I direct that the house be closed and that members will remove their personal belongings from the house by midnight tomorrow,' he said. A vandal approached the house an spray painted 'Tear It D' across the wall of the frat house - presumably meaning to paint 'tear it down.' At the SAE chapter at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, a Confederate flag could be seen hanging in the bedroom of one of the fraternity brothers. It was visible from the street through the fraternity's window, according to the O'Colly student newspaper. It has since been taken down. Coming down: University workers on Monday tore down the Greek letters for SAE on the fraternity house - after officials cut all ties to the fraternity . Frat house: The SAE base at the University of Oklahoma is pictured above. The university has cut off all ties to the fraternity and will ban it from campus . Fraternity members refused to speak to members of the media on Monday . Parents came out in to help their college children move out of the fraternity house on Monday . Alumni of the fraternity have also begun raising money Howard, the African-American cook who ran the kitchen at the fraternity for more than 10 years. Blake Burkhart wrote on the IndieGoGo campaign: 'That man is going to walk up to the SAE house tomorrow morning and hear that he no longer has a job. He is going to learn who has been working for. And through some cruel twist of fate, he has to lose the job that he has held for over a decade. He is going to lose his job because of a bus full of racist kids.' The campaign has raised more than $11,000 toward its goal of $50,000 to help provide support for Howard after losing his job. Also on Monday, rapper Waka Flocka Flame canceled his show at scheduled for this spring at the fraternity house. In a statement, the Atlanta-based musician said: 'I must say I'm disgusted and disappointed in the actions of the SAE fraternity at University of Oklahoma and I will be canceling my scheduled performance for them next month. Racism is something I will not tolerate.' The racist footage that kicked it all off was uploaded to YouTube Sunday and shows members of a Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter singing that there 'will never be a n*****' in their fraternity. In the brief clip, one two students stand up to a group of their peers, wearing bow ties and dress shirts, in the vile chant, sung to the tune of If You're Happy And You Know It. The footage is believed to have been filmed on Saturday - when the rest of the nation was focused on Selma, Alabama, where the president said the civil rights movement has not yet completed its long march. 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma . National heads of Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the fraternity Sunday night after the video was shared widely online, and suspended all of its members. During the sickening clip the students are clearly heard singing: 'There will never be a n***** SAE, there will never be a n***** SAE. 'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** SAE.' A female voice in the background can also be heard asking a friend: 'You've never heard it before?' The footage shows the group on a bus, apparently headed to a party. It was made public by a black students' pressure group at the university called Unheard. In the wake of the video, the national leadership of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which has branches across the country, said the University of Oklahoma chapter would be punished. Reaction: The national heads of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon have said those responsible will be punished . Brad Cohen, the Eminent Supreme Archon of the organization, confirmed that the video was authentic. He added that he was 'shocked and disgusted' by it, and said those responsible 'will be dealt with'. Cohen also said the song, which the video participants seemed to know well, was not part of any SAE traditions. A statement from SAE said: 'Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national headquarters has closed its Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video. 'In addition, all of the members have been suspended, and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently. At Oklahoma State University, the SAE chapter has a Confederate flag clearly visible from the street, hanging in the bedroom of one of the fraternity brothers . A vandal painted 'TREAR IT D' - presumably 'tear it down' - on the wall of the fraternity on Sunday night . 'We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way. 'Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities.' SAE has more than 200 chapters across the country, 15,000 undergraduate members and around 200,000 alumni. The mission of Sigma Alpha Epsilon is 'to promote the highest standards of friendship, scholarship, and service for our members based upon the ideals set forth by our Founders and as specifically enunciated in our creed, The True Gentleman.' For more than half a century, new members are required to memorize and recite the following: . 'A True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.'","University of Oklahoma President David Boren gave fraternity members until midnight Monday to vacate their house on campus .

"President Barack Obama may have become used to wearing golf shoes after spending the weekend hitting the links in the Sunshine State. The Commander-in-Chief, returning from a Florida trip where he played golf with wealthy donors, nearly took a tumble when exiting Air Force One on Sunday. He gave a wave to media before stumbling for a second and resuming his trot down to the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. Scroll down for video . Welcome back: President Barack Obama returned to Washington on Air Force One Sunday after a weekend in Florida . Rough return: Obama lost his footing temporarily while leaving his aircraft, gripping on to the handrails for support . Near tumble: The president did not fall during his slip, and was able to recover and continue trotting down the stairs . Back to business: Obama avoided a potentially embarrassing fall and went down to the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington . Obama kicked off the spring season at the resort where he once caused a stir by playing with Tiger Woods and had no official events scheduled. First lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha were not on the trip at the Floridian National Golf Club in Palm City, less than 50 miles up the coast from Palm Beach. The president's Sunday also featured a golf game with Houston Astros owner Jim Crane, who is a major Democratic party donor with a net worth estimated at $2billion. The pair's foursome was joined by Mitch Carroll, who is on the board of directors at oil company Halliburton, and private equity investor Glenn Hutchins, part owner of the Boston Celtics. Obama flew out of the airport in Fort Pierce, where he arrived before making the short trip to Palm City. The president also took time to reconnect with Florida pizza shop owner Scott Van Duzer, who famously gave Obama a bear hug in 2012.

Two years ago, Obama played 18 holes at the Floridian with Woods and Crane, who owns the club. He also practiced with Woods' former swing coach. Word of Obama's golf game with Woods in 2013 came initially from a professional sports journalist who was on the course and tweeted about it, even though the White House had prohibited the traveling press corps from observing Obama on the course. Like last time, the White House arranged for the reporters covering the president to wait at a separate location on the property where Obama won't be visible. According to local paper TCPalm, Obama was also expected to play the 18-hole course with Woods’ former coach instructor Butch Harmon.

"Louis van Gaal has given a fascinating insight into the man behind the mask in a sometimes funny, occasionally emotional and often compelling look at his career. The Manchester United manager and a host of current and former players including Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Xavi starred in a 90-minute documentary aired on the club's MUTV channel on Tuesday. Viewers learned the 63-year-old is a ferociously demanding boss but can also be the life and soul of the party - and is not without the ability to laugh at himself. Louis van Gaal and his wife Truus van Gaal pose on the sandy beaches of Vala de Lobo in Portugal. Van Gaal poses with his wife Truus during a dinner to celebrate Bayern Munich's title win . With a twinkle in his eye Van Gaal also revealed that he is very flexible, before adding 'and my wife knows this!' The show, Louis van Gaal: My Life. My Philosophy, took United fans on Van Gaal's journey from kicking a football around Amsterdam as the youngest of a family of nine to proudly striding out at the Theatre of Dreams. In typically bold fashion he relayed tales of his youth, claiming that after a couple of years of street football he was already better than his brothers. Dutch forward Robin van Persie hats with coach Van Gaal during a training session  at the Rotterdam Stadium . Then AZ Alkmaar boss Van Gaal looks on in angst ahead of a Uefa cup knock-out match with Newcastle . But a self-deprecating side of Van Gaal rarely seen was evident when he spoke about his own playing career and acknowledged he was not good enough to succeed at his beloved Ajax. 'I was a slow player so I had to think very quickly,' he explained. 'That's why I developed a tactical level that suits me now as a trainer coach.' Van Gaal spoke at length about his fabled philosophy and, in good news for United supporters, revealed that his players now understood it. 'I attack in four phases and I defend in four phases and I think the players know everything about the philosophy but now they have to perform,' he said. The Dutchman also compared United's struggle to adapt to his playing style with his own attempts to adapt to the English roads. Van Gaal shakes hands with Wayne Rooney after the victory against rivals at Anfield in the Premier League . Van Gaal arrives for World Cup match between Brazil and the Netherlands at the Estadio Nacional in Brasilia . 'It's like somebody coming to England like Louis van Gaal who has to drive with the steering at the other side,' he said. 'You have to learn that. I could have forced many accidents but I was fortunate I didn't do that. I was lucky but it was always going better so I don't have to warn people in my neighbourhood!' The programme was not without its sombre moments. In 1994 Van Gaal, a family man, lost his first wife Fernanda to cancer while he was Ajax manager. 'That year, when my wife died, was very difficult for me because I had two young daughters and was manager of the club,' he said. AZ coach Van Gaal reacts during the match between AZ Alkmaar and Newcastle United at the DSB stadium . 'My daughters were 15 and 18. You have to restructure your life. I have to say I had very great support off my daughters and that's why I could continue being manager of Ajax.' He added: 'The championship (they won later that season) was a tribute for my wife.' Ajax legend Ronald de Boer, who was in Van Gaal's team, gave a heartwarming insight into the support the well-liked manager had in the dressing room. 'I remember the day like yesterday,' he said. 'He told us he would not be able to coach every session because he had to be with his wife. He was so emotional and I remember the goalie Stanley Menzo came to Louis and gave him the first hug. I still get goosebumps when I think about it.' Van Gaal shakes hands with England striker Rooney after Manchester United's game against Liverpool . Van Gaal acknowledges the Manchester United fans after the disappointing defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford . Simon Mignolet denies Rooney a goal from the penalty spot at Anfield, but it was in vain as United won . De Boer and a host of other players to have served under Van Gaal also gave revealing glimpses of his training methods. 'He has a road map in front of you and he tells you which direction he wants you to go,' he said. Current United stars Rooney and Van Persie agreed. Van Persie, who has a long relationship with his compatriot, said: 'To play for him you have to be really fit. What he asks from players is not what other coaches ask from other players. 'He can be emotional and that's what I like. Everyone can have a good day or a bad day and he's no different.' Rooney added: 'I think he is someone you can trust. That's a really good quality.' Barcelona legends Xavi and Andres Iniesta both hailed Van Gaal's impact at the Nou Camp to where he moved from Ajax in 1997. Van Gaal returns to the bench during the World Cup match between the Netherlands and Argentina . 'He pushed me into the first team at 17,' said Xavi. 'He helped me so much through that difficult journey. In my opinion he did not get the credit he deserved at Barcelona. 'He was a coach who was ahead of his time.' Van Gaal said he enjoyed his time in Catalonia. 'It was a warm club like Manchester,' he said. 'It had a family culture also. We were champions the first two years, great years. The years we were there were the first three years with my present wife (Truus). With another smile he added: 'They were also a little bit like honeymoon years. That was also nice.' Friends and players from Bayern Munich revealed Van Gaal was exceptionally popular with the ladies of Bavaria. Markus Horwick, Bayern's head of media, explained: 'With men sometimes he is fighting but with ladies Louis van Gaal is playing the violin.' Van Gaal chats with Jose Mourinho prior to the match between Munich and Real Madrid at the Allianz Arena . And German journalist Andreas Werner said: 'We had a party in the town (following a title victory). He is a party monster – it was the Louis van Gaal show.' More praise came from those now working with Van Gaal in Manchester. 'He always says if you ever want to speak to him about anything you can,' said Rooney. 'His door is always open. He's 100 per cent serious (about that). You can speak to him about things other than football and he's a really nice guy.' As for his own thoughts on United, Van Gaal was equally impressed. 'The first feeling I had was especially after 11 matches when we had 13 points and I came in the stadium and I thought the fans shall not be pleased,' he said. 'The fans rose and clapped me when I entered. Now I see the greatness of the club.'","Louis van Gaal has given a fascinating look at his compelling career .

"Long-serving goalkeeper Petr Cech says he will leave Chelsea rather than spend another season as understudy to Thibaut Courtois. The 32-year-old Czech Republic international has lost his place to the young Belgian this term, starting only four Premier League games and being primarily used in the domestic cup competitions. While accepting manager Jose Mourinho's decision, Cech said the situation could not go on indefinitely. Petr Cech would be willing to leave Chelsea in search for first-team football after losing his place . 'I don't know what the club's idea will be. It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo,' he told the Idnes newspaper. 'But that can work for one season only. I don't want another one like this,' he added while on international duty for the Czechs who play Latvia in a Euro 2016 qualifier in Prague on Saturday. Cech joined Chelsea in 2004 and has won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the Champions League and three League Cups, the last of which was this season when he was in goal for the 2-0 defeat of Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley. The Czech international is still considered one of the best in the world and wouldn't be short of offers . With Mourinho clearly favouring Courtois, Cech's future will be of interest to a host of top clubs across Europe. 'There always will be speculation, I leave it for the summer,' Cech said. 'It will be important to sit down with the club, with the manager, to consider all the pros and cons. We will see what will work out the best.' Asked about a possible move to European champions Real Madrid, Cech said: 'When a specific offer comes I will consider it. There are offers one cannot turn down'. Thibaut Courtois is Chelsea's first choice and it looks unlikely that Cech will be able to budge him .","Petr Cech admits he'd be willing to leave Chelsea for first-team football .

"Wales assistant Rob Howley has defended Warren Gatland against Irish claims he has the ‘intellectual properties of a tub of Flora’. Gatland was subjected to a bitter personal attack by 36-cap lock and outspoken columnist Neil Francis, who accused the Kiwi of ‘shameful nepotism’ by selecting 10 Wales players for the final Test on the 2013 Lions tour. Francis added that Gatland was focused on improving his contract negotiations with the WRU at the time, prompting Howley to label the verbal barbs as ‘disappointing’ and ‘unfair’. Warren Gatland prepares his Wales team for Saturday's Six Nations clash against Ireland . Wales coach Gatland was subjected to a personal attack by former Ireland player Neil Francis . How Wales and Ireland will line up for the Six Nations match on Saturday . ‘You have to experience the Lions to understand the Lions,’ said Howley. ‘I’m not too sure if Neil Francis was a Lion. ‘The wonderful thing about rugby is everyone has their opinion about how the game should be played and there are personalities within the game. ‘When it becomes personal it is disappointing. The game is bigger than that. For someone to have an individual criticism and a personal snipe at someone who has won a Lions series, been involved in Six Nations Grand Slams and championships, is disappointing. We don’t need comments like that. It is a personal attack and totally unfair.’ Francis faced Wales four times for Ireland in the 1990s and was involved in a famous bust-up in 1992 with Tony Copsey, who knocked the forward off his feet with a right hook. ‘Neil was a very capable player and wasn’t someone to wind up the opposition,’ recalled Copsey. ‘We got on very well off the field, but he has always liked a controversial comment as a pundit.’ Since Francis played his final Test in 1996, Wales have managed just two wins over the Irish in Cardiff. Gatland was accused of having the 'intellectual properties of a tub of flora' by Francis . Wales assistant Rob Howley leapt to the defence of Gatland, labelling the barbs 'disappointing' and 'unfair' Gatland has endured a prickly relationship with the Irish media — being compared to a ‘menopausal warthog’ in 2010 — and is hoping to silence his critics in Saturday’s Test at the Millennium Stadium. The 51-year-old, who coached Ireland between 1998 and 2001, has refused to engage in a war of words this week and has instead praised Joe Schmidt’s team, laying the pressure on their doorstep. He has bypassed the ‘challenge’ of playing under a closed roof, with Howley confirming on Thursday that Wales will break with tradition and keep it open. The decision has avoided the sideshow that preceded Wales’s opening fixture against England, whose defeat in Dublin last week has been studied by the Welsh coaches. Gatland was also accused of ‘shameful nepotism’ by selecting 10 Wales players for the final Lions Test, 2013 . Howley sais Wales will be looking to dominate possession and territory against Ireland . ‘Watching Ireland against England was similar to our game at Twickenham last year,’ revealed Howley. ‘The things we need to dominate are territory and possession. That’s key against Ireland and they will be looking at those stats as well. ‘If you’ve got possession, then you don’t have to fight the aerial battle and the astute tactical kicking by Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton. Over the last four or five years the aerial battle has been a significant technical part of the game. It’s about winning the sky and we’re happy with where we’re at in terms of that battle.’ Sexton’s kicking game was one of Ireland’s most potent weapons in Dublin but the No 10 has since been struggling with a hamstring injury. He has been named in Ireland’s starting XV and Wales will be hoping the 29-year-old is a yard off the pace following his setback. Neil Francis represented Ireland 36 times during his career and is now an outspoken columnist . He will be joined in the line-up by Lions No 8 Jamie Heaslip, with the Leinsterman completing a remarkable return to fitness after breaking three vertebrae in his back only last month. Heaslip completes a powerful back row alongside Peter O’Mahony and Sean O’ Brien, who developed a close relationship with fellow farmer and Wales flanker Dan Lydiate on the 2013 Lions tour, which drew criticism from Francis. Lydiate — a strong campaigner against falling butter and milk prices — knows he will have to be at his chop-tackling best against the 28-year-old flanker. ‘Sean’s not easy to stop and it’s about slowing him down before he gets going,’ said Lydiate. ‘We got on quite well on the Lions tour and we’d always chat about farming with Tom Youngs and Rory Best. Sean’s sponsored by Massey-Ferguson and it’s only recently that I’ve been sponsored by JCB. ‘That’s something we can chat about after the game, but we’ll be giving blood, sweat and tears come the match.’","Gatland subjected to bitter personal attack by  columnist Neil Francis .

"Was Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain always destined for England recognition? The Arsenal star took to Instagram on Thursday night to upload a picture of himself as a youngster head-to-toe in a Three Lions home strip - his first ever football kit. The 21-year-old used the picture as part of the trend 'Throwback Thursday' with the midfielder accompanying the post with the caption: '#TB to my first football kit! My parents were clearly planning for it to last me a good few years… ""That's the perfect size, plus you've got a bit of room for growth.""' Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain posted a picture of himself as a youngster on Instagram . Oxlade-Chamberlain is all smiles with a ball at his feet as he poses in England's Euro 96 kit. Fast-forward to the present and the Southampton academy graduate has won 20 international caps for his country - winning 14 of those games and drawing six. Despite being a firm figure in the senior squad, Oxlade-Chamberlain's age means he is still eligible to play for the Under 21 side at this summer's European Championships. Former England U21 manager Stuart Pearce believes his successor Gareth Southgate must pick the midfielder along with other senior England internationals who can qualify for the tournament. Pearce, who was unable to select a raft of eligible stars from the senior squad for the last U21 Championship, thinks they would benefit immensely if he went to the Czech Republic. Oxlade-Chamberlain (centre) has won 20 international caps for the Three Lions to date . Ex-England Under 21 boss Stuart Pearce believes Oxlade-Chamberlain should play in the U21 Championship . 'England have to take their best players, all of the best players - not just one or two - for me you send the biggest squad out there,' the former England Under-21 coach told TalkSPORT. 'They are playing against the best in Europe at Under-21 level, the seniors are in a fantastic position for qualification. Roy (Hodgson) has done a good job in putting them at the top of their qualifying group, so you are not going to lose a great deal in regard to one or two of our brightest young players going to the Under-21s. The only thing you will do is gain.' England senior boss Roy Hodgson has said Southgate is free to choose whoever he wants for the tournament. That means Southgate could choose Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Calum Chambers, Jack Wilshere, Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Saido Berahino - who have all received senior call-ups. Fellow senior England international Jack Wilshere (left) is also eligible to play in this summer's tournament .","Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain uploaded the picture as 'Throwback Thursday'

"Aston Villa's form under Tim Sherwood finally looks to be hotting up with their 2-1 win against West Bromwich Albion - and midfielder Tom Cleverley celebrated by going out for a coffee with his partner Georgina Dorsett. Cleverley started in the 2-1 Tuesday night win at Villa Park, Sherwood's first win as manager and a first Premier League win in almost three months, which certainly merited a low-key celebration. And that's exactly what the on-loan Manchester United midfielder did, popping out to a local Costa Coffee branch in Cheshire with his partner and former The Only Way is Essex star Georgina. Tom Cleverley and his partner Georgina Dorsett walk from a Costa Coffee branch in Hale, Cheshire . The Aston Villa midfielder had a reason to celebrate after playing a part in Tuesday's 2-1 win over West Brom . Cleverley plays the ball past Craig Gardner before later being substituted following an all-action display . Cleverley was substituted after 77 minutes in the Midlands derby on Tuesday night but drew praise from fans for his all-action box-to-box display before being replaced by Leandro Bacuna. The midfielder is showing progress under Sherwood, and could be offered a permanent deal at Villa when his United contract runs out in the summer. Until then though, the focus is on battling against relegation. Tuesday's win lifted Villa out of the drop zone, although they could fall back into trouble with Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and Leicester City all playing on Wednesday evening. Cleverley drew praise from fans after the win over West Brom for his workrate and improved play . Georgina is an former star of The Only Way is Essex and has been with Cleverley since 2012 . 'I'm confident that what I'm telling the players is the correct thing to do,' Sherwood said after the win. 'But there is nothing like a win to cement that. It is huge for us. 'We have got a group that is not really suited for a relegation battle. The old-fashioned way is to battle but we have to play as if we are not in a relegation battle and pass the ball and move. 'If we go down we go down fighting.' Cleverley will hope to keep his place in the side when Villa meet Albion again in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday. Tuesday night's win for Cleverley and his Villa team-mates gave him and his partner good reason to chill out .

Speaking to Laureus.com, he said: 'I like to race, I really like to race. The 2015 cars are going to be evolutions of last year's cars, so it'll be the same people that we were racing with last year. Red Bull, Williams, and then you're hoping that it's a bit of a better year for those like McLaren and Ferrari, so that we have more people to race. The more the merrier. 'There was one year the first seven races were won by a different driver, a different team, that's what people want to see. But, most importantly, if the cars are close you can have real races where you're overtaking and battling and that's what I love doing. That's what racing's about.'

"A missing UC Berkeley soccer star who vanished in the early hours of Saturday after leaving a fraternity party 'drunk and disoriented' was struck and killed by a car, the LAPD said on Monday. Eloi Vasquez, 19, was fatally hit by the vehicle  at around 2.30am on Saturday, just an hour after he was last seen leaving a party at the University of Southern California fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon. His body was found on the state's 10 Freeway on a ramp around three blocks from the university's campus, his family said. However, police could not identify him immediately because of his injuries. But on Monday afternoon, the LAPD reportedly confirmed that the coroner’s officer had identified the person who was hit on the eastbound freeway as Vasquez - a tragic end to a two-day search for him. Scroll down for video . Missing: Missing soccer star Eloi Vasquez, 19, was struck and killed by a car, the LAPD said on Monday. Above, he is pictured (left) in his California Golden Bears team strip, and (right) at the party on Friday night .

Death: His body was found on the state's eastbound 10 Freeway (pictured) on a ramp around three blocks from the university's campus, his family said. Police could not identify him immediately due to his injuries . It is unclear what type of vehicle hit the student at up to 70mph, resulting in such serious injuries. 'The family is understandably very distraught and has respectfully asked for privacy,' police told KTLA 5. The devastating revelation came just hours after Vasquez's family had offered members of the public a $100,000 reward - increased from $50,000 - for information leading to the teenager's safe return. Earlier on Monday, Coroner’s Lt. Fred Corral had said that the county agency was investigating a 'John Doe', who had been fatally struck by a vehicle on the major east-west Freeway, near Vermont. Shortly after Vasquez was last seen, he had called a friend saying he was 'screwed' and had lost his way. The economics major and soccer star at the prestigious school had then lost contact. Reports said he was likely drunk at the time. His cousin Logan Crespan told DailyMail.com: 'He said he was going to the beach when he left the party but the closest beach was 15 miles away.' Vasquez's mother, Wendy Margolin, said that at around 2.20am her son had called a friend, Aurora, Cardenas, and told her he was 'screwed' and did not know where he was.

'He pretty much said, ""I need you to come over here, I need help."" I asked him, ""Where are you?"" and he told me that he was in LA and that he didn’t know where he was at and that he was lost,' Cardenas told NBC Bay Area. 'The second time he called it just clicked. I didn’t know if his phone died, or if he hung up.' Addressing the media Sunday, Ms Margolin said her son was very responsible and dedicated to his studies, and that it was it out of character for him not to contact his family and friends. Vasquez's parents drove to Los Angeles from Northern California Saturday to join the search for their son. Margolin was planning to scour doughnut and candy shops open late in the area. Meanwhile, his friends were visiting lifeguard towers in Santa Monica and Venice Beach. A missing poster described Vasquez as a six-foot, 175lb Hispanic man with dark hair and brown eyes. Last contact: Wendy Margolin (left), Eloi's mother, said a friend of her son's, Aurora Cardenas (right), got a call from him at around 2.20am Saturday telling her he was 'screwed' and lost . Appeal: Friends, relatives and teammates shared his missing poster in a bid to track him down before receiving the tragic news that he was actually struck and killed by a vehicle on the state's 10 Freeway . He was wearing a white and red t-shirt, white plimsolls, and gray chinos when he died after leaving the party on the 600 block of W 28th Street, a fraternity hub known locally as 'Greek Row'. Vasquez was not a member of a fraternity. Relatives told police he did not have any money or identification with him at the time. He did have a cell phone on him, but it appeared to have died. Cal Athletics released a statement Sunday addressing Vasquez's disappearance. 'Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal,' the press release said. 'Our entire Cal Athletics family is very concerned for Eloi’s safety and our first priority is to help in any way we can to locate him.'

Getting the word out: Friends described him as a 'really special kid' in Twitter appeals . He had also played for the California Golden Bears. A fellow player, Matthew Powell, tweeted a picture of Vasquez, writing: 'My former teammate, Eloi Vasquez, is missing...last seen at USC. Really special kid, keep spreading the word.'

"Zinedine Zidane joined in the clamour for the highly-rated midfielder Paul Pogba by claiming it is 'only logical' that Real Madrid want him on board at the Bernabeu. The France international, who is currently nursing a hamstring injury, extended his contract with the Old Lady until the end of the 2018-19 season back in October, however he has been consistently linked with a move away from Turin. The 22-year-old has attracted interest from a number of top European clubs, with Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Madrid all being tipped as potential suitors. Real Madrid Castilla coach Zinedine Zidane is not shocked by his club's interest in compatriot Paul Pogba . Pogba has been a key figure for Juventus this season and is a much sought after talent throughout Europe . Keen on a return to the Premier League, Pogba is reported to be part of a £100million summer wishlist at former club United and is also understood to have been closely monitored by Manchester City and Chelsea. With so much attention surrounding the young star - who has netted seven goals in 22 Serie A appearances this season - Zidane feels such interest should not come as a surprise to those aware of his talents. Juventus midfielder and former United player Pogba is also on Louis van Gaal's radar at Old Trafford . 'When we are talking about a player like Pogba, it is only logical Real Madrid are interested in signing him,' Zidane told French channel Canal+. 'He is a player with immense potential, who still has an important margin for improvement. 'He is still young and has an exciting future ahead of him. 'Where Pogba will play next season?

"The University of Mary Washington has suspended activities for its men's rugby team after officials there said an audio recording captured some team members chanting a song with lyrics that seemed to condone abuse toward women and even necrophilia. In an email to the university community on March 19, president Rick Hurley said the school imposed sanctions because the team's actions violated its code of conduct for club sports. According to the school, the recording featured several team members at an off-campus party at the end of the fall semester. Officials say the chant contained sexually explicit, derogatory and violent language. Scroll down for video . Sick: The University of Mary Washington rugby club has been indefinitely suspended after a recording of members singing a song about raping a dead prostitute leaked online .

' She was right and dead...Well g** d*** son of a b**** we're gonna get it in!' The November 2014 incident was recorded by a male partygoer--sans video--with a phone and uploaded to YouTube, Jezebel reports. It was soon reported to the administrations. In the months thereafter, the school's chapter of Feminists United got involved, with their president Paige McKinsey writing an opinion piece in the school paper when the club decided initial sanctions against the team weren't enough. 'As soon as Feminists United started affecting change on campus, we were faced with aggression and hatred,' McKinsey wrote, saying the group was attacked anonymously through the app Yik Yak. The group perservered, however, and in early March, they publicly released a transcript of the chant. With still no response, the group took things a step further by releasing audio of the chant to several news outlets on March 18. That same day, President Hurley informed the team of their punishment. Some students have been exposed to the 'offensive and lurid lyrics due to posting by others on social media,' Hurley wrote. Feminists United: The UMW Feminists United chapter fought for the team to be punished. They were targeted by members of the student body, who attacked them through the anonymous app Yik Yak . At an off-campus party at the close of the fall 2014 semester, several members of theUMW men's rugby club engaged in a chant that contained sexually explicit, derogatory, and violent language. Some students have now been exposed to those offensive and lurid lyrics due to posting by others on social media. No student on this campus should feel unsafe, ostracized, or threatened. Understanding that the offensive chant is antithetical to UMW values, and will not be tolerated, the University pursued action against the men's rugby club. At the beginning of the current semester, sanctions were imposed on the rugby club for willful violations of UMW's code of conduct for club sports. After an appeal by the accused, the disciplinary process concluded on March 18 with this ruling: All rugby club activities have been suspended indefinitely. Further, each member of the men's rugby club is required to participate in education and training sessions regarding sexual assault and violence. UMW's Statement of Community Values informed the process and response to this situation. As I stated yesterday, the University will not stand for such behavior. It not only violates our community values, it is not how members of this collegial campus live, and it is not reflective of the Mary Washington we all know and love. University policies prohibit discrimination, harassment, threats, and derogatory statements of any form. We pride ourselves on being a diverse, accepting, caring community, and we must live up to that ideal. I urge anyone on campus who feels unsafe, ostracized or threatened to immediately contact campus police or Dr. Leah Cox, Special Assistant to thePresident for Diversity and Inclusion. She may be reached at lcox@umw.edu or 540-654-2119. Richard V. Hurley . President . Source . 'No student on our campus should feel unsafe, ostracized, or threatened,' Hurley continued. 'We pride ourselves on being a diverse, accepting, caring community, and we must live up to that ideal.' Other sanctions imposed at the beginning of the semester were appealed and upheld. In addition, the team must participate in sensitivity training and education sessions. Messages left for the contact listed for the rugby team through the school's website and a campus women's rights group were not immediately returned. The incident at the Fredericksburg school follows recent news of a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma that was disbanded after its members were caught on video engaging in a racist chant. Last week, North Carolina State University also disbanded a fraternity chapter after the discovery of a notebook filled with sexist and racially offensive entries in a restaurant off campus. The University of Mary Washington was founded in 1908 and has about 4,000 undergraduate students.

"The chilling February murder allegedly committed by a Coast Guardsman from Virginia who drove 600 miles to kill a lesbian servicewoman with whom he was infatuated may have been videotaped. New court documents reveal Adrian Loya, 31, strapped a video camera to his chest before invading the Massachusetts home of Lisa Trubnikova and her wife Anna in early February, shooting them both and killing 31-year-old Lisa. Police say Loya wanted to enshrine the terrified final moments of the woman who, while serving alongside him in Alaska refused to reciprocate his advances, and said as much in a 250-page essay he allegedly left for authorities detailing why Lisa had to die. Scroll down for video . Horrific: The chilling case of accused Coast Guard killer Adrian Loya (center) became all the more shocking after new court documents revealed the 31-year-old allegedly recorded the murder of servicewoman Lisa Trubnikova in order to capture her terrified final moments . According to court documents, Loya had already been recording the couple using a video camera he'd affixed to a tree outside their Cape Cod home. On his own 31st birthday, Loya drove from Chesapeake, Virginia to the Trubnikovas' home in Bourne, police say. Before reaching the home, police say Loya blocked a street with his car and then set it ablaze and scattered fake bombs around it to slow down police. Armed with three rifles and a handgun, Loya then allegedly donned a black mask and the chest camera, shot his way into the house and then confronted the couple in their bedroom. Loya allegedly then ordered the couple to stand and opened fire. Lisa Trubnikova was shot in the legs and torso and killed, reports the Boston Globe. Lisa's wife of just two years was also critically injured, but managed to call 911 and summon police. As he fled the home and zigzagged around their neighborhood, police say Loya opened fire on them.One police officer, Jared MacDonald, was shot in the back. Tragic: Loya is accused of shooting his way into the home of Lisa and Anna Trubnikova and killing Lisa (right), with whom he'd allegedly been infatuated . Documented everything: Loya allegedly left behind a 250-page essay on his reasons for wanting Lisa dead for police to find . Loya would surrender about a half hour later. In his motel room nearby, police would discover face masks, handcuff keys, duct tape, fire-starting material, a survival handbook, a mess kit, a first aid kit, zip ties, a knife sharpener, and other items, reports the Boston Globe. Loya has since been charged with first degree murder and ordered held without bail, though he remains at a facility where he was subsequently sent for a psychiatric evaluation. His attorney J. Drew Segadelli told the Globe there's more to the case than meets the eye. 'This isn't the entire bulk of the evidence,' he said. 'I still think there's some skepticism as I review the police investigation,' However, prosecutors remained confident they had more than enough evidence for the first degree premeditated murder charge to stick. And when police told Lisa's relatives of the incident, their immediate reaction was that Loya had been 'fixated' on Lisa since working with the couple in Alaska. 'He became obsessed,' a family member told the Boston Globe. 'He was fixated on her.' Unthinkable: After driving some 600 miles to the Trubnikovas' home, police say Loya blocked the road to their condo with his car, set is ablaze and then scattered fake bombs to slow down police . Obsessed? Lisa's family says Loya had been obsessed with Lisa since he served with her and her wife in Alaska some years ago . Lisa and Anna, who married two years ago in New York, were stationed at different bases in Massachusetts, and worked together with Loya in Alaska several years ago. Lisa was a Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class of Coast Guard Base Cape Cod, and Anna is a Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class of Coast Guard Sector Southeastern New England. According to Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe, the attack appeared to be calculated. Loya checked into a hotel near the couple's residence two days before the shooting. 'I think there was a significant amount of planning involved,' O'Keefe said. 'He wasn't crazy,' said Lisa's older brother Luis Berlanga. 'He knew what he was doing.' After his arrest, police say Loya told them he killed Lisa 'based upon a prior interaction' that 'made up his mind that he was going to arrive at her residence in Bourne and murder her.' Court documents did not specify what or where that interaction was. Anna Trubnikova survived the attack but is now without her wife after just two years of marriage .","Coast Guardsman Adrian Loya was serving in Virginia when he allegedly drove to Massachusetts to kill Lisa Trubnikova on his 31st birthday .

"When it comes to leaders on the pitch Ireland coach Joe Schmidt knows he is blessed. Leading out the Grand Slam chasers against Wales in the Six Nations in Cardiff on Saturday will be talisman Paul O'Connell, the giant lock who will be earning his 100th international cap. O'Connell has captained Ireland in all but two of the 16 tests since Schmidt took charge but his style of leadership means other players are given their head when it comes to making decisions in the heat of battle. Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton has been in superb form for his country this season . Ireland captain Paul O'Connell is set to win his 100th cap against Wales in Cardiff . Sexton works on his ball skills as head coach Joe Schmidt (right) watches on at the Millenium Stadium . 'One of the other things is that Paul doesn't assume every leadership responsibility, he delegates and he encourages and so that is one of the fantastic things for the coaches as well,' Schmidt told the Irish Times. 'It means Jamie (Heaslip) has a definite role. He has some particular things that he leads on, that Johnny Sexton does, that Rob Kearney does, Peter O'Mahony, we have got a number of provincial leaders, Rory Best, who step up and take different roles of leadership. 'So I think of the best things about Paul is that he doesn't try to carry the whole weight of leadership on his own shoulders.' O'Connell will pack down with Leinster lock Devin Toner in the engine room the Irish pack . 'He is incredibly driven to improve his own performance and thereby leads others in doing that.' Fly-half Sexton, who will win his 50th cap against Wales, said O'Connell's very presence, both on and off the field, is an inspiration. 'He's an outstanding leader,' Sexton said. 'When he speaks to the squad during the week the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. 'He know how important his words are.' Sexton's predecessor and long-time team mate of O'Connell, Ronan O'Gara added: 'Paul is very, very special in terms of the ability to deliver the right message at the right time.' That quality will be especially handy in the red-hot cauldron of the Millennium Stadium where Wales, after their opening loss to England, have put themselves back in contention for the title. Victory would leave the grand slam tantalisingly close with an away match against struggling Scotland to finish. 'It's a massive game for a whole lot of reasons. An opportunity to do what no Irish team has ever done in the history of the game,' Schmidt said.","Ireland will clash with Wales at the Millenium Stadium on Friday .

However Diego Simeone's side have confirmed they are interested in the striker to bolster their attacking options as they look set to relinquish their La Liga title this season.

Former Manchester United striker and fellow Uruguayan Diego Forlan insisted a move to Madrid would benefit Cavani. Cavani, reacting after missing a chance against Chelsea, has attracted the interest of Atletico Madrid . 'Cavani to Atletico Madrid? It would be spectacular,' said Forlan. 'He is a great striker and he is in great shape. I think his style of play would be ideal for Atletico because he is a fast player who likes to counter-attack and to play in space.

"Porto right-back Danilo admits he is proud to be linked with Real Madrid, as the European champions step up their interest in the Brazilian right-back. Although he insists he is fully focused on his current club, Danilo is 'ready' to sit down at the end of the season and discuss his future. 'I'm living a great moment with Porto,' he told Spanish newspaper AS. 'It makes me happy a great club like Madrid is interested in me.

Newcastle United are watching Malaga's highly-rated forward Juanmi. The 21 year-old earned a first call-up to the Spain squad last week as a replacement for injured Chelsea striker Diego Costa and is due to play against Holland on Tuesday. Juanmi came through Malaga's youth ranks and is the club's youngest goalscorer after scoring on his debut against Getafe in a Copa del Rey match at just 16 in 2010. Juanmi (11) is being watched by Newcastle and could be set for a move to England in the summer window . Newcastle have had success with former Tenerife striker Ayoze Perez who is attracting interest from other Premier League sides already and are exploring the Spanish market again to see if they can pick a bargain. Juanmi can play on either wing or as a second striker and is contracted to Malaga until 2018.

"Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Clarence Seedorf have lavished praise on Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal after working under the Dutchman during the early stages of their respective careers. Van Gaal appears to have made a lasting impression on the aforementioned trio having managed Xavi and Iniesta at Barcelona during his two spells at the Nou Camp and Seedorf during his six-year stint as Ajax boss in the 1990s. Xavi, Iniesta and Seedorf - speaking exclusively to MUTV in an interview which will be screened on Monday night - have lauded Van Gaal's philosophy. Clarence Seedorf is among a host of players who have heaped praise on Man United boss Louis van Gaal . Van Gaal managed fellow countryman Seedorf during his time at Dutch outfit Ajax in the 1990s . 'For sure he is a coach who knows how to pass on his philosophy to his teams,' said Seedorf. 'And I think what you have seen that with the Ajax spirit when I played there - that's Van Gaal. 'Instead of buying many players you can always fill your first team with your own players who know the club culture, who know the club tactics and have lived for so long that everything for them is natural. 'He is a great coach and his record speaks for itself.' Xavi, who was given his Barcelona debut by Van Gaal back in 1998, and club team-mate Iniesta echoed Seedorf's comments regarding the Dutch tactician. 'Well my personal experience with him was great,' said Xavi. 'He gave me the opportunity to join the first team and he gave me a lot of confidence the whole time. 'I worked with him and he really put his faith in me. He pushed me into the first team at 17 and helped me so much through that difficult journey. Van Gaal (centre, pictured  with a young Seedorf in July 1993) managed Ajax between 1991 and 1997 . Barcelona midfielder Xavi has also lauded Van Gaal for promoting him into the Catalan giants' first team . Andres Iniesta has thanked the Manchester United boss for helping him make an 'important step' in his career . 'In my opinion he didn't get the credit he deserved at Barcelona. He had very clear ideas and was very methodical. He was a coach who was ahead of his time.' Iniesta added: 'I was 17 years of age and delighted to be in the first team, and he gave me that opportunity. I knew that he had always done tremendous work with the young players. 'I was excited to work with him and take such an important step in my career. He's hard working, honest, sincere. Above all, he's a hugely successful manager who's done great things in the game.' Current Manchester United stars Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Victor Valdes will also reflect on working under Van Gaal during the MUTV documentary. Van Gaal took over the reins at Manchester United after helping Holland reach the World Cup semi-finals . Current Man United duo Robin van Persie (centre) and Wayne Rooney (right) have also lauded Van Gaal . 'Louis van Gaal: My Life. My Philosophy' airs at 7.30pm on Monday night exclusive to MUTV.

"Here is some news that might cheer up Angel di Maria. The Argentina international is having a miserable season at Manchester United but his form would not appear to be affecting his popularity - with shirts bearing his name requested more than any other player in the Premier League. According to retailers Sports Direct, who sell Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Liverpool, United, Manchester City, Tottenham and Newcastle shirts, Di Maria's is the name asked for by almost one in 10 of fans in stores. Manchester United's record summer signing Angel di Maria tops the list of SportsDirect player shirt sales . Di Maria has struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford despite a bright start last year . Di Maria, Sanchez and Costa make up with top three with a combined share of 15.66 per cent . His tally of 9.59 per cent puts him streets ahead of Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, with the Chilean playmaker in second place with 3.8 per cent. Di Maria has struggled for form since his £59.7million summer switch from Real Madrid. He has also had to endure an attempted break-in at his home which saw him and his family move to a hotel in a panic before finding a new residence in the heart of the city centre. But these figures will give the winger a boost as he bids to stop his Old Trafford career from ending before it has even began. Alexis Sanchez has 13 Premier League goals to his name and is second with with 3.80 per cent share of sales . Chelsea's Diego Costa sits third as the Premier League's three big summer signings make an impact . Costa, seen here scoring against Arsenal in October, has 19 Premier League goals to his name so far . Another summer arrival on our shores, Chelsea's Diego Costa, is the third most-requested player with 2.27 per cent ahead of Di Maria's United team-mated David de Gea on 2.16 per cent. Speculation that the Spanish goalkeeper will quit Manchester to head back to his home city of Madrid to join Real has not deterred fans from opting for his name on the back of their shirts. Belgium and Chelsea star Eden Hazard is in fifth place followed by United pair Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao - another South American import who is struggling to adjust to life in the Premier League. David de Gea's No 1 United shirt is the fourth-most requested with a share of 2.16 per cent . Belgium and Chelsea star Eden Hazard (left) is in fifth place followed by Wayne Rooney . MLS-bound Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard is in eighth place followed by Manchester City's Sergio Aguero in ninth while another United striker, Robin van Persie, completes the top 10. Just missing out is Newcastle's popular Spaniard Ayoze Perez, who takes 11th place. As for Christian names 'Jack' is the most popular request, accounting for 0.39 per cent of name sales. Strikers are the most common to be asked for with Luke Shaw, the most popular defender, in 38th place on the list.

"These are the joyous first strokes of a newborn hippopotamus, with its loving mother right there to help out. The baby hippo, who was born yesterday at San Diego Zoo, was filmed Tuesday exploring the waters with its mother, Funani. Zookeepers have not yet determined the name of the hippo calf, who is said to be bonding well with its mother. And they call it hippo love: The baby - yet to be named - and his mother Funani were pictured enjoying the water at San Diego Zoo, California . Observers have said Funani is nursing her newborn regularly - a process which will continue for the next eight months. Adorable footage of the two together shows Funani nudging the calf through the main hippo tank at the attraction. Later, the two relax at the water's edge. Learning: Funani helped nudge her newborn through the water just a day after it was born . Bonding: Zookeepers say the two are getting along well together, and that Funani has been nursing the baby frequently . The calf's father, a 3.6-tonne hippo called Otis, was removed from their tank in anticipation of the birth. The two will be reunited later on. Funani was born at Toledo Zoo in Ohio, and lived in Knoxville, Tennessee before coming West a decade ago. She has given birth two 11 calves since 1989, the zoo said. One was born last April, but died just five days later, according to the San Diego Times. Hanging out: The two spent time at the edge of the water too, where the child nuzzled its mother .

"Every transfer window, clubs scramble to pick up the best bargains, and fans argue over who their side really need. But, seven months after last summer's window swung shut,which of those deals have proved to be value for money? As we reach the business end of the season, now is the time for the men brought in to start really showing their worth. But who have been the best signings of the season so far? Sportsmail takes a look... 10 - ANDER HERRERA . Athletic Bilbao to Manchester United . Well, he finally became a hit after being allowed to play consistently. Makes Manchester United tick, has an eye for a pass and gets himself involved in the final third, making sure the main striker doesn’t have to come searching for possession. It’s a mystery why Louis van Gaal didn’t fancy the former Athletic Bilbao midfielder to begin with, but he has really made his mark since enjoying a real run in the team. They do love a classy caresser of a ball at Old Trafford, which clearly works in his favour. Ander Herrera has finally begun to show his class at Old Trafford after a slow start under Louis van Gaal . The Spaniard has become a key part of United's midfield, allowing the likes of Juan Mata to flourish . 9 - DARYL JANMAAT . Feyenoord to Newcastle United . Mr Dependable, which is a name you do not normally associate with Newcastle defenders. It is baffling that Van Gaal - who must have known he needed a right back on arriving at Manchester United - did not feel the need to sign a player he started in every World Cup fixture for Holland. Cheap and pleased for the opportunity in the Premier League, Alan Pardew and Graham Carr did their homework on this signing and it’s helped no end at the back for the Magpies. Daryl Janmaat has proved excellent value for Newcastle, becoming a regular at right back in his first season . Janmaat is a Dutch international star, and Newcastle did well to pick him up for such a small fee last summer . 8 - TOBY ALDERWEIRELD . Atletico Madrid to Southampton (loan) Nine clean sheets for Southampton with the Belgian defender in the team and - despite him making noises that he probably won’t be around next season - they have easily coped with the loss od Dejan Lovren to Liverpool. Quick enough for the Premier League, he’s kept up with the best and added a touch of class at the back for Saints. Toby Alderweireld has shown the pace and class needed in the Premier League since joining Saints on loan . 7 - RYAN BERTRAND . Chelsea to Southampton (loan and then permanent) Luke Shaw’s boots may be small in a literal sense, but figuratively Bertrand had a job on. Southampton were smarting at losing their teenage sensation who careered down the left last season, but it’s as if he was never really there as the former Chelsea man carries equal threat going forward and has actually appeared more comfortable defensively. What good business it was then to get Bertrand snapped up on a permanent deal in January. Ryan Bertrand and Nathaniel Clyne have been inspirational at full backs for Southampton this season . After signing him on loan in the summer, securing Bertrand permanently looks like a masterstroke . 6 - GRAZIANO PELLE . Feyenoord to Southampton . A fairly unknown quantity on signing from Feyenoord for £8m, Pelle’s physical presence and deftness of touch has made him a huge hit on the south coast. Important goals and some panache to go with it, the Italian has earned his first international call-up while on Ronald Koeman’s watch and carries a severe threat inside the 18-yard box. Even after his goals have dried up somewhat, Graziano Pelle' strength and quality have been a major asset . Pelle's goalscoring start to the season earned him his first Italian caps, and he scored on his debut . 5 - MAME BIRAM DIOUF . Free agent to Stoke City . A deceptively effective forward, and terrific value for money for free. Diouf struggled at Blackburn but redefined himself in the Bundesliga with Hannover and has taken that goalscoring form to the Potteries. Scoring more than one in every three starts, the Senegalese has chipped in with crucial goals for Stoke and has been a relatively unsung hero this year. Edges out Southampton’s Sadio Mane in this list based on the respective transfer fees (Mane cost £11.8m) and amount of chances their sides create. Mame Biram Diouf has chipped in with vital goals for Stoke at an impressive record since joining for free . Despite a tough time in his previous spell in England, the Senegalese star has proved his worth this season . Diouf launches into his trademark celebration after scoring one of his nine Stoke gaols this season . 4 - DIAFRA SAKHO . Metz to West Ham United . Has suffered a couple of injuries, but that hasn’t had any lasting effect on his impact at Upton Park in a debut season. Sniffs out goals from nowhere and has that low centre of gravity which has defenders quaking. Strong in the air and with his back to goal, Sakho brings others into play as well as netting on a regular basis. Had he not come back from international duty injured, the Senegalese might have been pushing Harry Kane and Costa for the golden boot. Diafra Sakho's goals were a big part of West Ham's brilliant start to this season, after signing from Metz . The Senegalese striker has shown he can score with his head as well as his feet, and has proved great value . 3 - DIEGO COSTA . Atletico Madrid to Chelsea . That blistering start to the season means Costa will be in every list similar to this from now until May. His 19 Premier League goals are one of the chief reasons why Chelsea look like winning the title. But it’s not all about hitting the back of the net - fans at Stamford Bridge have also bought into his style of play. The Spain international bullies defenders, shakes their confidence and is fairly nasty. Proper Chelsea. Diego Costa has endeared himself to Chelsea fans with his nasty side, showing aggression as well as quality . Costa's 19 Premier League goals already have fired Chelsea to the brink of the title . 2 - CESC FABREGAS . Barcelona to Chelsea . Where would Costa have been without Fabregas? Back in the capital, albeit over the other side, his campaign got off to a similarly stunning start, assisting almost at will as Chelsea battered all those put in front of them. Yes, there is an argument to suggest his form has dipped, but Fabregas is worthy of making the list because of that reintroduction to English football. You get the sense he could move through the gears if necessary, too. Providing more assists than any other player by far, Cesc Fabregas' Premier League return has been superb . His form may have dropped off since the turn of the year, but Fabregas has still been a stand-out star . Offering more defensively than at previous clubs, Fabregas has become the complete midfielder this season . 1 - ALEXIS SANCHEZ . Barcelona to Arsenal . A game-changer. Someone who is capable of turning no points into three and putting opposition to the sword. Fierce in possession, his burst of pace can unlock defences in a flash. Not happy playing second fiddle to Neymar and Lionel Messi at Barcelona, Sanchez has proven this term that he is one of the premier forwards in world football and shown to Arsene Wenger why it’s probably wise to shell out on quality every now and again. Alexis Sanchez's pace and skill have proved to be a match-winning combination since he joined Arsenal . The Chilean forward has provided superb goals and stunning displays since leaving Barcelona this summer . No signing has had as great an impact on their new side this season as Arsenal's Chilean superstar .","Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez has been superb since signing from Barcelona .

"Kell Brook is talking about fighting Floyd Mayeather or Manny Pacquiao, Juan Manuel Marquez or Brandon Rios — in no given order — before a Wembley blockbuster with Amir Khan sometime next year. Nothing wrong with ambition but the first question Brook has to answer comes in his home town of Sheffield tonight. It has less to do with his undeniable boxing ability than with whether he truly is recovered from the machete attack which inflicted horrific wounds to his left leg. Kell Brook poses on the scales at the weigh in ahead of his match with title challenger Jo Jo Dan . Brook will defend his IBF welterweight title against Dan in his home city of Sheffield on Saturday night . Brook assures us that all is well following that bizarre incident in Tenerife where he was celebrating the stunning win over American Shawn Porter which gained him the IBF world welterweight title. Eddie Hearn, his Matchroom promoter, tells of how demonically Brook has laboured in the intervening six months to rescue his career from near death and the fear of never walking again. But what no-one can know until he climbs into the ring as a world champion for the first time is whether there is any residual damage. For a boxer there is more to getting better than for most of us. It is with the legs that a prizefighter exercises his thrusting mobility. It is from the legs that he generates the majority of his punching power. Brook is set to compete less than six months after a horrific stab attack nearly left him dead in Tenerife . Dan poses on the scales at the weigh in ahead of his title match with IBF welterweight champion Brook . Brook's attack left him with a 12-inch wound on his thigh and he has shown great strength to recover . If either his balance or strength in that leg has been sapped, Brook will find it doubly difficult to perform at elite level. If both are reduced, he will be diminished. Thus the examination about to be conducted by his moderate challenger, Jo Jo Dan, will be more medical than a test of Brook’s talent. With older boxers it is the legs that go first. But you never find out for sure until he is engaged in the heat of battle. Close scrutiny on Sky television will determine whether Brook, at 28, has been slowed prematurely. A small impediment is unlikely to be enough to deprive him of a homecoming victory, even though Romanian- born, Canadian-based Dan insists he has prepared himself to shut out the roar of Brook’s partisan support. Brook claimed the IBF welterweight title in 2014 when he defeated the previous holder Shawn Porter (left) But the issue is whether he wins in athletic style, with the ‘five-star performance’ he is promising his fans. The local crowd, those of us at ringside and British boxing at large will be hoping he can. If so, he will travel to Las Vegas for May 2 to be ringside for the Fight of the Century, eager to argue his case for meeting the winner of Pacquiao and Mayweather in a world welterweight unification fight. That is markedly less likely to happen than an autumn fight with Rios, en route to an eventual showdown with Khan. But if Brook puts on a show this weekend there would be no harm in asking. Brook and Dan square up with one another ahead of their IBF title match in Sheffield on Saturday .

"Newcastle have announced record profits of £18.7million last season due to increases in television income and new deals with sponsors. The club, owned by Mike Ashley, also saw revenues increase by 35 per cent from £95.9m to £129.7m, the club said. More than half Newcastle's income - £78.3m - came from the new Premier League television rights deals, with commercial income also increasing. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has seen his side record a profit for the fourth consecutive year . Newcastle fans have not taken to Ashley since he took control of the Premier League club in 2007 . A Newcastle statement said: 'Most significantly, the club reported strong commercial revenue growth delivering £25.6m in 2014, up from £17.1m in 2013. This 49.7 per cent increase was largely the result of two lucrative new deals with the club's principal sponsors, Wonga and Puma.' It is the fourth successive year the club have made a profit and cements Newcastle's positions in financial terms at least as one of the most successful in the top flight. The club's debt remained static at £129million in the form of an interest-free loan from owner Mike Ashley - none of the debt has been repaid. Newcastle managing director Lee Charnley said: 'I am pleased to report a positive set of results which confirms the healthy financial position the club now finds itself in and is a reflection of the prudent and measured manner in which we operate. A large proportion of Newcastle's income came through sponsorship deals with Wonga and Puma . 'The club benefits from a supportive owner and is financially stable. This gives us a strong platform from which to grow, both on and off the pitch, a result of which means, as we move forward, we are able to net spend on the playing squad and invest in other areas of the business. 'The most pleasing aspect in this set of accounts has been the growth in our commercial revenue and it has been our strongest year yet in that respect. 'With our commitment to keeping ticket prices affordable for our supporters, growing our commercial income has been crucial.

"George Coetzee and Marcel Siem kept their hopes of qualifying for the Masters very much alive on the opening day of the Hassan Trophy at Golf du Palais Royal. Both men had the daunting task of knowing only a victory in Morocco would be enough to book a trip to Augusta next month for the first major championship of the year. But they got off to excellent starts on Thursday, with South Africa's Coetzee carding a 67 and Siem a 68 to finish two and three shots respectively behind France's Adrien Saddier. German Marcel Siem watches on during the opening day of the Hassan Trophy at Golf du Palais Royal . Siem, chasing a spot at next month's Masters, shot a round of 68 to stay in contention for the title in Morocco . Saddier, who was one shot off the lead before the final round of the Madeira Islands Open was cancelled due to bad weather on Sunday, made the most of his sponsor's invite to card a flawless 65. The 22-year-old chipped in on the first for an eagle and repeated the trick on the sixth for the first of his five birdies to finish one shot ahead of England's Daniel Gaunt, who carded seven birdies and a solitary bogey on the 18th. Coetzee shared third place with Scotland's David Drysdale and England's Chris Wood, with Siem a shot further back after five birdies, an eagle and three bogeys in his round. Starting from the 10th, Coetzee - who won the Tshwane Open on his home course in Pretoria a fortnight ago - birdied his first two holes and also picked up shots on the 16th and 17th to reach the turn in 32. George Coetzee carded 67 on Thursday to remain near the top of the leaderboard in Morocco . Further birdies on the first and seventh took Coetzee to six under, but the 28-year-old ran up a double bogey on the next after his tee shot rolled back off the green and his first chip caught the same slope and came back to his feet. However, the world number 69 made amends with a birdie from 20 feet on the ninth, just minutes after Siem had holed from an almost identical position. 'Augusta is on my mind, obviously,' Coetzee said. 'I'm here to try to qualify, but I'm just trying to play golf and hopefully on Sunday I will be in contention. Coetzee prepares to take a tee shot on the opening day of the Hassan Trophy at Golf du Palais Royal . 'There is still a lot of work to be done. If it all doesn't work out then I've got a nice five-week holiday. I'm just playing and enjoying my golf. I'm in a good space mentally.' Siem led from start to finish here in 2013 and looked to have done enough to climb into the world's top 50 and secure his Masters debut. However, after the results of the Houston Open were taken into consideration a few hours later, the 34-year-old discovered he was ranked 51st and had missed out by just 0.03 world ranking points. 'It's a big week for me and four under is a good start,' Siem told Sky Sports 4. 'I'm really excited about playing the Masters, I've never played it. I finished it off two years ago and still did not get in. It was a little horrible. World No 69 Coetzee must win the title this weekend to qualify to play in the Masters at Augusta . 'I'm going to keep doing what I did today, try hard not to make any stupid mistakes. I have got the experience and I know the golf course.

Siem and Coetzee were not the only members of the field with Georgia on their minds, with Alexander Levy, Andy Sullivan, Tommy Fleetwood and Ross Fisher all having chances to move into the top 50 before Monday's deadline. Fleetwood was the best placed of that quartet after an opening 70, with Levy recording a 72 and Sullivan two over following a 74, while Fisher struggled to a 77 which was matched by defending champion Alejandro Canizares.","The first major of the year, the Masters, begins on April 9 in Augusta .

"Andy Murray goes into his next match at the Miami Open against Colombia’s Santiago Giraldo on Sunday, but his Great Britain Davis Cup colleague James Ward has had to fly home to rest a sore knee. Ward, the British No 2, has paid a high price for his heroic win over John Isner in Glasgow earlier this month, having lost three first rounds subsequently, and now finds himself out of action for two weeks. He was due to play in Guadeloupe next week but instead has gone back to London, where he eventually hopes to be able to begin preparation for next month’s clay court events, once his knee has settled down. Andy Murray is gearing up for a Miami Open clash with Colombia's Santiago Giraldo on Sunday . James Ward has had to return to England to rest his sore knee, and won't play in Guadeloupe as planned . Giraldo, Murray's Miami Open opponent on Sunday, is number 31 in the world rankings . Murray, who plays Colombia’s world No 31 Giraldo in the third round on Sunday, expects to team up with Ward this summer at Queen’s Club for the Davis Cup quarter-final against France. With the newly-extended three-week gap between the French Open and Wimbledon, it will mean six weeks of high profile grass court tennis in the UK, and Murray feels the longer run-in after Paris will help him. ‘I think it’s better for me if there are more weeks on grass,’ he said. ‘A lot of the players will go and spend a week at home after Roland Garros whereas for me I can easily practise on grass, for a lot of the players it’s not easy to get on grass courts.’","Andy Murray will play Colombia's Santiago Giraldo at the Miami Open .

"As speculation mounts over whether a shockingly out-of-sorts Tiger Woods will be able to compete at next month's Masters, his good friend Notah Begay III rates his chances of taking part in the year's opening major as '50-50'. Woods, a former world No 1 whose ranking has plummeted to 96th, has played only twice on the 2014-15 PGA Tour and said he would not return until his game was 'tournament-ready'. Woods, the 14-time major winner, has struggled to find any form this year . 'As far as Augusta is concerned ... it's literally a 50-50 chance right now from what I can tell,' Begay, who played with Woods on the Stanford University golf team, told digital network 120 Sports on Wednesday. 'That's far better odds than what it was, say, three weeks ago. Three weeks ago, I would have said there was maybe a 1-in-10 chance of him playing at Augusta.' Woods has not competed since he withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open early last month after 11 holes because of tightness in his back, and is still adapting to the fifth swing change of his career. Woods is currently on an indefinite break from the sport but aims to qualify for the 2016 Ryder Cup . He missed the Masters at Augusta last year for the first time in his career after being advised by doctors to have back surgery and his participation this year is in serious doubt given his struggle for form and fitness this season. The 14-time major champion posted the highest score of his professional career as he carded a mind-boggling 11-over-par 82 to miss the cut at the Phoenix Open in January, and many pundits believe he is suffering from the chipping 'yips'. However, Begay, a television analyst with Golf Channel, believes Woods is now settling into his new swing under the supervision of consultant Chris Como. Tiger Woods struggled for form during the Waste Management Phoenix Open back in January . 'It was good for him to take a step back, to reassess a variety of different things and do things on his timeline,' said Begay, a 42-year-old Native American golfer who won four times on the PGA Tour. 'My suggestion to him was to take as much time as he needed to just figure out this issue with his short game and also to work on or clean up a couple of things that might be a little loose with his golf swing. 'Any transition, any change that you are making mechanically, takes a little time to settle, so that's what he's done. We've had some good discussions over the last week or so and he feels good about it.'","Injury-hit Tiger Woods has played only twice on the 2014-15 PGA Tour .

'He loves that type of ground they usually get, he should go the trip and I think he's a better horse in the spring. We think he's got a nice weight.' The last time Walsh rode Ballycasey, in the Ryanair Stakes at the Cheltenham Festival, the Irish jockey  pulled the eight-year-old up. 'He didn't fire on the day and Ruby wasn't happy with him from early on,' said Mullins. 'Perhaps the slower pace of the National will suit him. We're hoping he'll be better on a flatter track.'

"Here's the bad news for Robert Rock: despite the camouflage we CAN see what you're wearing at the Trophee Hassan II on Thursday. The 37-year-old Englishman turned heads at the European Tour event by wearing an ostentatious blue and pink camouflage jumper, and in the process added to golf's long list of crimes against fashion. Rock has arguably the most famous hair in golf thanks to his insistence on being one of the few players not to wear a sponsored cap, leaving his carefully-coiffed mane on view at all times. Tiger Woods got a fine view of the do when Rock claimed a brilliant victory by beating the 14-time major champion at the 2012 Abu Dhabi Championship.

Rock is far from the first offender when it comes to golfers breaking the laws of fashion.

"These are the secrets harbored for more than 100 years by a miles-wide reservoir outside of Seattle, Washington. Lake Tapps, which was flooded in 1911 to power a hydro-electric dam, swallowed up four and a half square miles of countryside, including an old railway line and parts of a forest. The images, taken last week by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, also shows discarded items which have been lost in the lake, which is now used for recreation. Scroll down for video . Revealed: This old wooden railway trestle was unveiled by a draining operation at Lake Tapps, near Seattle, Washington . Emptied out: Local authorities started emptying the lake to enable repairs to be made to a nearby dam. In usual conditions the above homes jut out onto the water . Authorities in the Seattle area drained the lake this winter to relieve pressure on the nearby dam, which had developed a crack. The lake was first formed when the Puget Sound Energy energy company filled the area with water to generate electricity. It stopped producing power in 2009 and has been used for fishing, boating and other waterborne activities since. The maintenance project has now been completed, according to Bonney Lake Courier-Herald, and the lake is being refilled. The process is expected to be finished at the end of May. Abandoned: Bits of junk, and items like this CD, were also uncovered by the lake-emptying project . Underwater forest: These tree trunks have been sitting under the water for the 104 years since the area was flooded .

"Manu Tuilagi is a major doubt for the World Cup after it emerged the England and Leicester star is unlikely to play again this season. The powerhouse centre, one of the first names on Stuart Lancaster’s team-sheet when fit, has not featured since October and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup in September after suspicions his groin injury was worse than first thought were confirmed by Leicester. Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘Manu is improving but it is a long process. The likelihood is, he may not play this season.

The 23-year-old, who Mailsport understands is suffering from the notoriously troublesome condition known as ‘Gilmore’s Groin’, is now likely to have just three warm-up matches this summer to prove his fitness ahead of the World Cup, which kicks off on September 18. Leicester, who have conducted a root and branch review of their medical department this season, have repeatedly insisted his return is imminent despite growing rumours the problem is more serious than they have let on. In February Cockerill accused Tuilagi of inadvertently exaggerating the extent of his injury after he gave an interview saying he would not feature in the Six Nations.

"Jonny Wilkinson has rubbished reports he will join England's back-room staff for the World Cup, claiming 'they've already got all the coaches they need'. World Cup-winner Wilkinson scotched French media reports he would assume a kicking coach role in England's build-up to hosting World Cup 2015. The former Toulon and England fly-half has addressed Stuart Lancaster's squad several times, and admitted he will continue that ad hoc relationship. Jonny Wilkinson (left) insists that he is not on the verge of joining the England coaching team . Wilkinson did admit that he would one day love the chance to be involved with the national team . Jonny Wilkinson has a coaching role at Toulon, the club he finished his playing career with . Wilkinson believes that England already have many accomplished members in the coaching setup . The 35-year-old admitted he harbours 'serious reservations' about whether he will seek a full-time career in coaching, despite currently holding a skills role at Toulon. Wilkinson lives close to England's Pennyhill Park training base in Bagshot, and uses the hotel gym - where he admitted he comes into casual contact with the Test squad. 'They've already got all the coaches they need and everyone can see how good the job is that they are doing,' said Wilkinson. 'There's no need for me to be there, apart from just to be positive. 'It came out of France, which is why it's so random. I don't know why they would know anything about what I'm supposed to be doing. 'But in terms of being around England, it's great because there's no feeling that I need to sneak through, if I see someone, Stuart Lancaster, Graham Rowntree or the players, I just say 'hi, how's things?'. 'There's absolutely nothing I can say about that story, honestly, it's the most difficult thing, because I can say actually nothing about it.

Racal Decca RFC took on Streatham and Croydon at Farnborough rugby club, with Wilkinson running on the kicking tee much to the surprise of the two teams. Frimley-born Wilkinson conceded he may never chase a full-time coaching career. 'I don't know, to be honest I have serious reservations about my ability to coach groups of players,' said Wilkinson, when asked if he wants to coach England in the long run. 'It's a very different job from one-on-one coaching, where you get to know a personality, you understand them and work with them on a day-to-day basis. 'It's a very different job and a very, very tough job taking a group and living that life. 'I don't know, I honestly don't know.

"Stoke City manager Mark Hughes accused Joel Ward of making 'the best save of the match' after being denied a clear penalty during in Saturday's 2-1 home defeat against Crystal Palace. Hughes was left feeling aggrieved after two big decisions failed to go his side's way having taken a 14th minute lead through Mame Biram Diouf. Asmir Begovic was controversially penalised for a challenge on Yanick Bolasie to allow Palace to level from the spot after 41 minutes. And then after Wilfried Zaha had put the visitors ahead, Diouf's goalbound shot in the second half was blocked two-handed by Ward with the Palace getting way with it. Stoke City boss Mark Hughes has accused Joel Ward (right) of making 'the best save of the match' Marko Arnautovic shares words with Crystal Palace's  Ward during the Barclays Premier League clash . 'That decision left us scratching our heads,' said Hughes. 'Referee Andre Marriner missed a lot of things. I know Julian Speroni did well in the Palace goal but arguably that was the best save of the match. He has got two hands on it for heaven's sake. How he doesn't give it, I've no idea.' It rubbed salt into the wound for Hughes who had earlier seen Palace awarded their penalty. 'When you see the replay, the lad Bolasie has got his foot up high above Amsir. That has why Asmir has missed the ball and the referee has deemed it a penalty. It was a key moment, that is one you want them (the officials) to get.' Even so, Hughes didn't have any excuses for Palace's winning goal from Wilfried Zaha on the stroke of half-time from Glenn Murray's flick-on. Asmir Begovic was adjudged to have fouled Yannick Bolasie during a colision inside the penalty area . Begovic was shown a yellow card by  Andre Marriner after he was adjudged to have brought down Bolasie . 'It was a mistake from us. It was just a long ball, if you don't clear the first ball, you have to deal with the second ball. We didn't and that is what cost us. We are better than that.' Stoke slipped to ninth while Palace are now 11 points above the bottom three and Alan Pardew is above his former club Newcastle United in the table.

"In reality, Dick Advocaat has six games to save Sunderland's season and his own proud record of never having been relegated. For you can as good as write off the last two matches of this desperate campaign, trips to Arsenal and Chelsea. Sunderland have not won away in 2015 and there is no evidence to suggest they will start to do so at the home of top-four opponents. Sunderland interim manager Dick Advocaat has said his side will play 'ugly' football if they need to . Advocaat's Sunderland debut was marred by a 1-0 defeat at West Ham thanks to Diafra Sakho's late goal . West Ham striker Nene (left) jumps for the ball alongside Sunderland defender Patrick van Aanholt (right) Advocaat set out with beautiful intent at West Ham, naming three strikers having 24 hours earlier rubbished mention of his defensive reputation — but things have very quickly got ugly. 'The only important thing in the final games is winning,' said the 67-year-old, whose Premier League debut ended in defeat when Diafra Sakho struck two minutes from time. 'The way we do that is not important. So if we win games very ugly I like that. We will play very negative if the need is there.' Advocaat has given his players the early part of the week off, an agreed rest period which is the legacy of Gus Poyet's ill-fated reign. The Dutchman joked that the club don't have too many international players so their preparations for the visit of North-East rivals Newcastle a week on Sunday will not be disrupted. That, you feel, is a match Sunderland must now win. By a quirk of footballing fate, previous bosses Paolo Di Canio and Poyet both enjoyed derby victories in their second match in charge. Sunderland winger Adam Johnson prepares to strike the ball after coming on as a substitute on Saturday . For Advocaat, it is arguably his most winnable game of the eight remaining. Defeat is not an option. 'Being at home in derbies gives a big advantage,' he added. 'I know the intensity of these games — I was involved many times in Rangers against Celtic. 'I made the mistake of perhaps not realising that at first and I lost 5-1. 'But Newcastle for us now is the most important thing. We have a good period to practise and I think the (international) break is a good thing. I have time now to see what my best line-up will be.' Hammers boss Sam Allardyce, meanwhile, has been linked with the Sunderland post at the end of the season. He, however, wants a new deal at Upton Park after seeing his side climb to ninth. 'I don't know why people have speculated about me and Sunderland,' he said. 'I'm doing what I did here in my second year, my contract was running out then. 'At the end of the season we will look at the squad. We have to get more players in to build the club and make sure we sustain the growth we are achieving at this point in time.'

"Southampton have been the surprise package of the 2014-15 Premier League season on the pitch and the Mail on Sunday can exclusively reveal they are one of the big winners off it, making a £31.4m profit in their latest accounts. This is the first time Saints have posted a profit since going into administration and plunging into League One in 2009, when they were saved by the late Markus Liebherr. The books for the year ending June 2014, to be published in the coming days, are firm evidence of how his daughter Katharina has is continuing a remarkable turnaround. Luke Shaw is tackled by Steven Naismith at Goodison Park during his time at Southampton . Some fans feared the worst when the club sold Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert last year. But they were replaced well, and at a profit, and Ronald Koeman’s aim of Champions League qualification has seemed surprisingly feasible for much of the season. In an exclusive interview with the MoS, Southampton’s chief executive Gareth Rogers says he expects further similar profits in the future, and there is zero financial pressure to sell any stars this year. ‘We do not need to sell any players in the summer,’ he says. Liverpool's Rickie Lambert celebrates after scoring a goal during the UEFA Champions League Group B match . There is increasing speculation that France midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, 25, and England right-back Nathaniel Clyne, 23, might be lured away by giant rivals, possibly Arsenal and Manchester United. Research published this month by research specialists The Football Observatory in Switzerland showed Southampton had the most profitable academy in Europe measured by total sales value of transfers of players produced within each since 2012. The top 10 clubs: . Rank Club Sample star product . 1 Southampton Adam Lallana . 2 Lille Eden Hazard . 3 Real Sociedad Antoine Griezmann . 4 Sevilla Alberto Moreno . 5 Borussia Dortmund Mario Gotze . 6 Real Madrid Esteban Granero . 7 Barcelona Bojan Krkic . 8 Stade Rennais Yann M’Vila . 9 Montpellier Remy Cabella . 10 St-Etienne Kurt Zouma . Rogers cannot categorically say it won’t happen. He does unequivocally promise that any transfers would be made on Saints’ terms and at Saints’ prices. ‘We make decisions based on what is the best thing to do for the club at the time,’ he says. ‘But we don’t need transfer fees to fund the operating costs of the club.’ If any players did leave, any income would be fully available for replacements. Southampton’s accounts show income last season of £106m and a profit after tax of £33.4m. The main source of revenue was TV money, and that rose from £47m to £79.5m. Match day income was up slightly to £17.1m and commercial income climbed 23 per cent to £8.3m. The club’s total wage bill rose by almost a third from £47.1m to £62.95m, and has risen again this season, to be reflected in the accounts in a year’s time. The club’s total debt is £50m, owed mostly to Katharina Liebherr, who injected £20m in the financial year. That money is being used to clear an external historic loan to offshore company Vibrac, effectively a ‘payday loan’ firm to big companies. Rogers says Liebherr’s commitment to making Southampton a stronger club, and a stronger business, was evident in her allowing all of last season’s transfer receipts to be re-invested. Adam Lallana swapped St Mary's Stadium for Anfield Stadium after coming through the ranks at Southampton . Dejan Lovren also swapped St Mary's Stadium in favour of a move to Champions League outfit Liverpool . The headline income for the five major players sold was reportedly £94m but the MoS can reveal Southampton cleared ‘only’ £82m on them - after fees, sell-on payments to Lyon and Bournemouth in relation to Lovren and Lallana respectively, and Premier League levy payments of 4 per cent on each deal. Saints accounted for £31.9m of the quintet’s transfer receipts in the 2013-14 figures, but have spent the balance (£50m) plus another £12.6m on the permanent purchases of Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle, Fraser Forster, Shane Long, Florin Gardos, Sadio Mane and Ryan Bertrand, and on the loans for Toby Alderweireld, Eljero Elia and Filip Duricic. Southampton's Graziano Pelle celebrates scoring during their Premier League match with Manchester United . Summer arrival Dusan Tadic celebrates scoring the opening goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford . Ryan Bertrand was one of many incoming players at Southampton following a summer of changes . ‘There was an opportunity to clear the entire debt of the football club [by selling Lallana et al] and taking out money that had been put in, but Katharina didn’t do that,’ Rogers said. ‘Instead she allowed us to re-invest all of the money, either in fees or contracts. And she also put another £20m in [to clear the Vibrac debt]. ‘It would have been easy to take the money out, but this shows the commitment to the club.’ Rogers, who celebrated the first anniversary in his CEO role last week, after years as the club’s chief financial officer, says Saints’ business plan ‘shows you can be a successful club [on the pitch] and be sustainable at the same time.’","Southampton post profits for first time since plunging into League One .

"Ronny Deila will use international week to scout for Celtic signings but he and his spies are more likely to be spotted at Under-21 or national youth team games than a Euro 2016 qualifier over the next 10 days. Deila wants his club to gain a standing in world football on a par with Ajax for their development and production of young talent. That, he says, will enable Celtic to tempt the elite young stars in European football to Scotland. The Celtic manager’s goal is to close out this season with a domestic Treble, then make the additions capable of helping the squad through the Champions League qualifying rounds. However, it is unlikely that Deila will be throwing a few million pounds to secure any eye-catching signing that would raise supporter expectations ahead of that late summer campaign. Ronny Deila (centre) wants to implement the same youth production standards as Ajax in the future . He explained: ‘We will bring in players but I think we will bring in younger players to build the next generation behind the current one. ‘If we are going to fight with the best clubs in Europe for the best 22-year-olds, then you can forget it. No chance. The only chance we have to get a world-class player is to go to 16/17-year-olds and say: “You will train with the first team”. ‘That’s our chance to get a player in. We have to find some very big talents that can be the best ones. The Celtic boss will use the international break as an opportunity to scout potential younger talent . Celtic have a great chance of completing a domestic treble and thrashed Dundee United once again . ‘We have to think younger and give them the chance to get in the squad and train with the best ones. ‘Ajax get it because they have an unbelievable reputation — and we have to build, over the years, a reputation. That if you come to Celtic, you see what is happening, you get sold to the big clubs and you get a good development.’ Deila helped Real Madrid wonder kid Martin Odegaard on to early stardom by handing him his first- team debut at 15 in Norway. While Celtic would not stand a chance of tempting him to Scotland when Spanish, German or English giants are scrapping for his signature, Deila believes less precocious talent than Odegaard can be mined then nurtured into better long-term prospects under him. ‘There are players there, maybe not at Odegaard level, but close,’ said Deila. ‘With a good development, they can be past Odegaard if he makes the wrong decisions and we make the right ones.’ Deila played a vital role in Martin Odegaard's rise to stardom when he was Stromsgodset manager .","Ronny Deila will be scouting heavily during the international break .

"There is no place in Darren McGregor’s mindset for a soppy nod to his old allegiances. He let out a roar of relief, a leap of joy and a pumped fist of celebration after lashing home the key goal that condemned former club Cowdenbeath to a defeat that could damage their hopes of avoiding relegation — and helped Rangers draw menacingly level on points with his boyhood heroes Hibernian. McGregor’s superb strike was the essential response to the visitors drawing level through Kudus Oyenuga and sparked a three-goal flurry in the final seven minutes that saw Rangers claim a first Ibrox victory since January 3. Darren McGregor led Rangers to a 4-1 victory over Cowdenbeath at Ibrox on Saturday . Rangers' Haris Vuckic celebrates his second goal during the Scottish Championship match at Ibrox Stadium . Rangers' Lee Wallace and Cowdenbeath's John Robertson fight for the ball during the Championship match . The gloss finish was provided by super sub Haris Vuckic, who produced the other two late strikes. Rangers may have been landed with the worst-value loan deal in football history by former directors Derek Llambias and Barry Leach sanctioning the signings of four Newcastle fringe players who have been ill or unfit. But on this form — with five goals in nine appearances — the new regime won’t be in a hurry to disentangled themselves from the deal that sees Vuckic here until the end of a season which now features a scrap for the most advantageous play-off positions. Rangers looked in no kind of shape to contend with McGregor’s childhood favourites Hibs for that runners-up berth three weeks ago when they last faced Cowdenbeath. A scoreless shocker at Central Park was one of the most insipid Rangers displays of the past three seasons. The wind and churned pitch were offered up as mitigating factors following that dire effort, but there were no excuses here as a team revitalised by Stuart McCall to gain a first win in six last Sunday at Easter Road sought to build momentum in the spring campaign. Rangers fans celebrated the life of Davie Cooper in the first home match since the 20th anniversary of the wing wizard’s death, with tribute banners and songs. McCall gave the player named after one of the greatest ever Ibrox heroes, David Cooper Templeton, a chance to star on the left flank against the strugglers. In his first start since January 10, Templeton was a marked man. Colin Marshall was booked after 70 seconds for a lunge on the ex-Hearts man. John Robertson soon followed into Brian Colvin’s notebook. Cowdenbeath's Kudus Oyenuga scores his first goal of the game during the Scottish Championship match . Rangers' Vuckic celebrates his first goal during the Scottish Championship match at Ibrox Stadium . Vuckic celebrates his second goal with teammate Ryan Hardie during the Scottish Championship match . That was no discouraging tactic because Templeton was in the mood for mischief and he did as much as any Rangers player to tire out the visitors with his trickery. Rangers quickly brushed off a bright start from the visitors that saw Cammy Bell shut down a Sean Higgins chance. The home side moved the ball around briskly, stretching and asking questions of a Cowdenbeath defence that had leaked 31 times in nine matches. Robbie Thomson kept out centre- halves Bilel Mohsni and Lee McCulloch with headers from corners. Nicky Law picked up the scraps of a mazy Templeton run to carve out a chance that smacked off the far post and fell kindly to the visiting keeper. Both home strikers Nicky Clark and Kenny Miller shot wide when presented with their goes at goal. McCall could have no complaints about the volume of chances being crafted by his side. Cowdenbeath’s endeavours to stem the tide were overseen by Lee Makel, deputising for boss Jimmy Nicholl who was preparing for Northern Ireland’s key qualifier against Finland, and he admitted that they rode their luck to go in level at the interval. Rangers needed a helping hand early in the second period and they got one from Thomson as the away keeper allowed a Lee Wallace drive squirm from his grasp. The penalty-box instincts of Clark beat Nat Wedderburn on the slide as he bundled the ball over the line just inside the left-hand post for his seventh of the season. Clark’s grafting and harrying for the ball was noteworthy as Rangers strived for a second but the 23-year-old will have nightmares over his 71st-minute miss. Once again, Templeton tormented down the left and he delivered a devil of a low ball across the face of goal. Vuckic couldn’t reach it but Clark looked to arrive in the nick of time at the back post to provide the finishing touch, but it was the side-netting that rippled from the forward’s wayward shot. Miller’s fresh air header wasn’t much better and failure to put the game to bed meant that Rangers were only one slip away from losing their grip on the contest.

Nicky Law (left) has a shot at goal for Rangers in the Scottish Championship match with Cowdenbeath . Cue the latest Mohsni muddle as his ghastly pass was intercepted by Lewis Toshney, who spied Oyenuga in isolation 22 yards out. He spun without pressure and took a couple of strides before maintaining his composure and burying a powerful right-foot finish beyond Bell. All the old frailties were in danger of creeping back to bite Rangers as Templeton looked to injure himself attempting a clever backheel. McGregor was booked for a cynical foul to stop another Cowdenbeath break and fears of a fourth successive home draw brought scorn from the stands. McGregor calmed those nerves with his third goal for the club, latching on to a loose ball on the edge of the area and lashing a shot into the far corner. Makel threw caution to the wind in the hunt for another leveller but that played into the hands of Vuckic, whose class exploited the extra space. He and the excellent Wallace produced a terrific exchange of passes to scythe through the remains of the Cowdenbeath defence, culminating in the Slovenian tucking home a neat finish.","Rangers thrash Cowdenbeath in first Ibrox victory since January 3 .

"Neil Lennon insisted on Sunday night that the return of Rangers to the Premiership is 'essential' for the good of Scottish football. The former Celtic boss reckons the Hoops have suffered due to a lack of competition in the top flight since their greatest rivals' liquidation in 2012. Lennon, now in charge at Bolton, told Goal.com: 'It's essential for the game in Scotland that Rangers get back to the Premiership as quickly as possible. Bolton manager Neil Lennon thinks it is essential that Rangers win promotion back to the Scottish top flight . Lennon, who managed Celtic for four years, believes Scottish football is struggling due to lack of competition . 'They are struggling, but new people have come in who I think have the best interests of the club at heart. 'Stuart McCall had a fantastic record at Motherwell. They need to get back to the Premiership for the state of the game up there – in terms of revenue, crowds, competition. 'It's important and I think that's why Scotland has struggled. Celtic need it as well – the competition has been missing.' Lennon guided the Parkhead side to the knockout stage of the Champions League during his four-year spell in the dug-out, but revealed that the overall decline of the Premiership's financial situation had necessitated the sale of key players. Lee Wallace (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after giving Rangers the lead away to Hibernian . He said: 'It all depends on Celtic. When I was there we ended up selling the crown jewels in terms of Victor Wanyama, Gary Hooper, Joe Ledley, Georgios Samaras. 'It's very difficult to keep churning out those players, but that was the financial situation. There's no doubt the Scottish game is significantly weaker. 'Hibs, Hearts and Rangers are in the Championship and they were a big loss in terms of revenue, crowds, quality and competition. 'It's lacking at the minute, it's not in a great state. There are seven or eight teams in the Premiership who have average gates of 4-5,000 and with that it's very difficult to compete with other European countries.' Kenny Miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for Rangers and close the gap on Hibernian . Lennon believes that smaller European countries may look to combine with their neighbours to create more competitive leagues. 'There is talk of amalgamating leagues – the Dutch league, they're starting to fall behind a bit, but Belgium have had a resurgence at national level. 'The Eastern bloc, as well – you never see any of those teams participating in the Champions League these days.

"In the shelter of a Murray Park conference room, Nicky Law cut a relaxed figure on Friday. After a leisurely arrival in a pair of shorts and flip-flops, he greeted the assembled media with a smile, a handshake and a joke about his dubious choice of footwear. The atmosphere in the room was relaxed. Jovial, even. And at odds with the previous seven months of a season when the atmosphere surrounding Rangers has usually been much darker and tense. Truth be told, the only guiding light at Ibrox this season has been a half-lit torch leading straight to a land where only chaos itself holds jurisdiction. Where perpetual farce and vitriol have been interrupted only by the false dawns of hope and sanctuary. Nicky Law believes that Rangers' promotion destiny is finally in their own hands after months of anguish . For Law, however, a corner has now been turned. Now in his second season at Ibrox, the 26-year-old midfielder has been one of the few Rangers players who might - yes, just might - have achieved pass-marks so far this campaign. Following last weekend’s 2-0 victory against Championship promotion rivals Hibs - a timely boost for the new regime and caretaker boss Stuart McCall - Law believes that the club’s promotion destiny is finally in their own hands after months of anguish. ‘Last weekend gave a huge lift to everyone, going and beating Hibs at Easter Road,’ he grinned. ‘We had been comfortably beaten by them three times previously this season, so there has been a huge difference in and around the place this week. ‘The manager has relayed the message to us that we are now in charge of our own situation once again – our own destiny. Everyone in our changing room came to play with Rangers in the Premiership and, even as bad as we have been this season, getting promoted is still within our grasp. ‘When you come into work in the morning, you can see everyone smiling again – not just the players, but also all of the club staff. It’s great to see things like that again because it’s been doom and gloom right from the word go this season. Rangers boss Stuart McCall has taken over the Ibrox side in reach of gaining promotion back to the SPL . ‘We lost our first game of the season, then had a little bit of a lift, but things spiralled again from there. It was downhill all the way and it has been difficult. ‘People are now looking forward to coming into training again and they’re looking forward to games, which is the most important thing – the game against Cowdenbeath on Saturday actually can’t come quick enough for us. ‘There has been such negativity surrounding the place. It got to the stage where you genuinely didn’t want to leave the house. If your family wanted to go out you would just say: “No, let’s just leave it and stay in.” The whole thing is so consuming that it affects your personal life – not just your professional one. ‘Then last Sunday against Hibs was a huge improvement. You could see the energy and desire in the team was fantastic. ‘But we are under no illusions. We know that dropping points against Cowdenbeath would be no good, so it’s up to us now to press on. ‘For the first time in a while, we’re probably looking forward to our own game - but we should be looking forward to every single game at home. Lee Wallace (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after giving Rangers the lead away to Hibernian . Kenny Miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for Rangers and close the gap on Hibernian . ‘I go back to my old Motherwell days when you had Rangers away and you would dread going to Ibrox. In the week leading up to it in training, you knew you were in for such a tough game. That’s what it should feel like for teams coming to us now. We want to put fear into visiting teams at Ibrox and we will only do that by winning more games.’ Conventional wisdom might point to the old adage of familiarity breeding contempt – but that’s not the case for Law and McCall. Law spent two seasons playing under McCall at Motherwell, before moving to Rangers in the summer of 2013, and was a key figure in the Fir Park side the manager led to consecutive second-place finishes in the Premiership in 2012 and 2013. ‘The gaffer has given everyone such a massive lift since he arrived at the club,’ said Law. ‘His personality, his character and the way he is so positive – it’s all great. He laughs and jokes with everyone and just lifts our spirits. Kenny Miller celebrates his goal with the Rangers fans during his side's win in the Championship last weekend . ‘People might think I’m biased because I have worked with him before, but I have no doubt whatsoever that all of the lads would say the same thing about him. ‘It’s not just his energy, but his coaching ability, too. Last week we switched to a 3-5-2 formation at Hibs. The gaffer made sure we worked on it all week in training, made sure everyone knew their jobs and made sure no stone was left unturned. ‘He gets the best out of you and improves you as a player. In that respect, he is actually the perfect man for the job here because the club is not in a position to go out and spend fortunes on new players. ‘He has a track record of working with a budget, working with what he’s got and doing really well. It’s hard to teach that ability of having an eye for a player and being able to spot talent, but he has it. ‘He’s been first-class with us since the moment he walked through the door. Our confidence was totally shot to pieces. He has played a huge part already in us turning that around and, hopefully, we can now kick on towards promotion.’","Rangers beat promotion rivals Hibernian 2-0 last weekend .

"Gareth Southgate is refusing to be carried away by his England Under-21 side after seeing them take another significant step forward with a victory over fellow European Championship finalists Germany. Southgate's youngsters twice came from behind at Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium before surging to a 3-2 win, to the delight of a crowd of 30,178. However, despite also beating Portugal and hosts the Czech Republic, who will also be at this summer's finals tournament, the former England defender is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. James Ward-Prowse wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner in England Under 21's win . Saints midfielder completed an unlikely comeback that saw two late goals scored in  three minutes . Asked if he was excited by what might lie ahead, Southgate said: 'Not really. 'I love working with the group that we have, staff and players, it's a real united body of people. We have got quality and they want to be the best they can be, so they have got a chance. 'But we also know that we are very quick to put people on a pedestal, and we haven't achieved anything yet. We have had some good results, we have had some nice compliments, but we know what our goal is and we know that we are driven to achieve that. 'We are not interested in too much until we do that.' Nathan Redmond leaps for joy after bringing England level at 2-2 with a deflected shot in the second half . Jesse Lindgard brought England level for the first time with a composed finish from Carl Jenkinson's cross . Southgate's caution was perhaps a reflection of an ordinary start by his team as they struggled to get to grips with a Germany squad boasting some 600 more top-flight appearances than his. England fell behind with just 15 minutes gone when Kaiserslautern striker Philipp Hofmann, celebrating his 22nd birthday, expertly controlled and converted a left-wing cross, and after Jesse Lingard had levelled, restored Germany's lead within five minutes of the restart. The home team left it late to make the big push, but when it came, it was decisive. Germany striker Philipp Hofmann scored a brace but could not prevent the Young Lions from securing win . Liverpool and Germany midfielderEmre Can (right) slides in for a tackle on England's Jake Forster-Caskey . Nathan Redmond's strike from substitute Alex Pritchard's pass levelled it with 10 minutes remaining, and it was left to skipper James Ward-Prowse to win it two minutes later when he accepted full-back Carl Jenkinson's ball and calmly steered his shot past keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Asked how he would manage expectation ahead of the summer, Southgate said: 'We will just show people the first 25 minutes of the game - that will keep everybody's expectations in check, it's as simple as that. 'We have belief in the group of players, and they are fantastic to work with. We believe they can play at a very high level, but we believe because of the talent and the ability that they have and the attitude that they have that we can keep pushing them. 'We have to keep pushing because the standard will go up again in the summer and everybody else will be more competitive again, and we have got to be the same.'

"Celtic have vowed to help John Guidetti contest an SFA charge after the compliance officer cited the striker for allegedly making an offensive comment on Dutch TV. Interviewed by a TV station in Holland, the former Feyenoord striker is said to have made a slur against Rangers while relating the words of a song Parkhead supporters sing in his honour. The Swede, who is on loan from Manchester City, is alleged to have breached disciplinary rule 73. He has until next Monday to reply to the charge with a principal hearing date scheduled for April 9. Celtic have vowed to support on loan striker John Guidetti after he was charged by the SFA . Celtic, however, voiced their astonishment that the matter had got this far, spokesperson saying: ‘We are very surprised and disappointed that this has even found its way to an SFA judicial panel. John Guidetti will be defending this charge.’ Meanwhile, the club has been hit with a combined £9,460 fine for two UEFA charges of misconduct during the second leg of last month’s Europa League showdown with Inter Milan in Italy. A penalty of £5,860 was imposed for ‘improper conduct’ on the field as well as a £3,600 punishment for flares set off by fans at the San Siro.

Three flares were lit in the Celtic end during the Europa League clash with Inter Milan at the San Siro . Celtic responded to the latest fine in a statement which read: ‘Clearly, Celtic Football Club is disappointed by today’s decisions. ‘It should be noted that Celtic players have an excellent disciplinary record in European football over many years and in Scotland, Celtic has been top of the league’s disciplinary table for the last three years, something which we are rightly proud of. ‘Again, it is disappointing that the actions of one or two individuals within a support of well over 3,000, have let the club down by using flares at this match.’ Virgil van Dijk (third left) looks away as he is dismissed in the first half for Celtic against Inter last month .","John Guidetti is said to have made a slur about Rangers on Dutch TV .

The Argentina international started strongly under Louis van Gaal but has found starting opportunities limited  lately and was sent off in United's FA Cup defeat to Arsenal for pushing referee Michael Oliver in March. As for Pogba, the France midfielder is one of the most coveted players in Europe. He has been instrumental in helping Juventus establish a 14-point advantage at the summit of Serie A, while helping his side into the quarter-final of the Champions League, where they will meet Monaco. The 22-year-old, who was on United's books, has been linked with a move to Madrid but PSG could try to edge ahead of their European rivals with a big money offer to take Pogba back to France.

Berti Vogts has joined USA as a technical adviser teaming up again with Jurgen Kilnsmann . Vogts managed Klinsmann when he was in charge of Germany during the 1990s . 'He was a winger and then I told him, ""Oh, that's not your best position, you have to play in the middle"",' Vogts recalled. 'He did that and he started a big, big career. He is always enthusiastic. He's more American than a German. The Germans are thinking about things. Jurgen is always positive. That's an American way of life. That's good. That's good for the team, good for the sport, good for all of them.' Vogts will oversee the development of players in Europe, and collaborate with Herzog and Matthias Hamann on scouting, talent identification and club relationships. 'We had a fantastic experience with Berti during the 2014 FIFA World Cup,' Klinsmann said in a statement. 'His knowledge and experience is a tremendous asset for us. With Andi Herzog having a big focus on qualifying the U-23 team for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Berti will make an even more important contribution.'

"A controversial red card for Wasps' Nathan Hughes saw Northampton come from behind to win a tumultuous clash 52-30 at Franklin's Gardens and move 14 points clear at the top of the Premiership. Hughes was sent off for kneeing Northampton and British Lions winger George North in the head as he scored Saints' and his second try. The Wasps number eight complained it was unintentional, but after watching replays on the big screen, referee Craig Maxwell-Keys decided to issue a red card five minutes before half-time. George North is treated for a head injury during the Aviva Premiership match at Franklin's Gardens . Nathan Hughes' knee collided with North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . The winger was knocked out immediately before receiving lengthy medical treatment for his knock . After suffering concussion in Wales's opening Six Nations match against England, when he was knocked out twice, there were worrying scenes as North lay motionless on the ground. He started moving shortly afterwards as medics attended to him before he was stretchered from the pitch. A minute before the incident, after 34 minutes, Alex Lozowski kicked a penalty to put Wasps 20-8 in front, but they went in 27-20 down at half-time after a dramatic turnaround saw Northampton add two tries from lineout drives after North's try. Hughes was sent off his tackle but felt aggrieved claiming it was an accidental collision at the try line . Northampton tweeted just before half-time that their star man had woken up from his terrible injury . And yet it was Hughes who inspired Wasps' opening try after four minutes when he turned over George Pisi on the visitors' 22. Wasps shifted the ball to the wing to set Christian Wade free, and speed home. Lozowski added the conversion. Northampton: Wilson; K. Pisi, G. Pisi, Stephenson, North; Myler, L. Dickson; Corbisiero, Hartley, Ma'afu, Lawes, C. Day, Wood, Clark, Manoa . Replacements: Haywood, A. Waller, Denman, S. Dickinson, Fisher, Fotuali'i, Waldouck, Tuala.

Jackson, Thompson, Weepu, G. Hughes, W. Helu. Tries: Wade 3 . Penalties: Lozowski 3 . Conversions: Lozowski 3 . Referee: Craig Maxwell-Keys . Northampton hit straight back as Stephen Myler fired a crossfield kick into the arms of North to score, while Myler hit the post with the conversion to leave Wasps 7-5 in front. The home side were offside at the restart allowing Lozowski to add three more points and the fly-half then showed an electric turn of pace to skip through a gap to send Wade flying over, while Lozowski converted from the touchline to make it 17-5 after 20 minutes. Myler and Lozowski exchanged penalties, before the match-turning incident. Samu Manoa caught the re-start and sent North powering into the corner, but as he grounded the ball the Hughes ran into him, kneeing the Welsh winger in the head. North appeared knocked out, lying motionless for a short while. As the medics got to him he started moving and after a lengthy delay he was stretchered off. Meanwhile, Maxwell-Keys showed Hughes a red card. Hughes complained to the referee as he walked off and a Wasps water carrier - conditioning coach Dan Baugh - had to be pulled away as he argued with Saints forwards coach Dorian West on the touchline. After a long wait Myler missed the touchline conversion, but Saints had a penalty from the restart and Myler booted it into the corner. Saints' maul steamrollered towards the line only to be dragged down and Maxwell-Keys awarded a penalty try. Myler's conversion suddenly made it 20-20. Christian Wade of Wasps dives in to score his third try of the match but it wasn't enough for the win . On the brink of half-time, Saints kicked another penalty to the corner and as their maul piled towards the line, Alex Corbisiero broke off to touch down and Myler converted to make it 27-20. Facing 40 minutes with 14 men Lozowski kicked a penalty as Wasps moved number eight Ashley Johnson to hooker and managed to win a scrum against the head on Saints' 22. They moved the ball wide where Daly drew two men before offloading to Wade. Lozowski landed the touchline conversion to make it 33-30 with 11 minutes left. Courtney Lawes of Northampton Saints is tackled by Nathan Hughes before he was sent off . Stephen Myler prepares to kick a conversion after George North's try for the Northampton Saints . The comeback was short lived though, as three minutes later Ken Pisi touched down and two tries in two minutes from Ahsee Tuala, plus two conversions by Myler saw Northampton bring up the half-century. Referee Craig Maxwell-Keys angered Wasps director of rugby Dai Young by producing the card after watching replays. But Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder insisted: ‘It was reckless coming in with the knee and some serious consequences happened because of that. The opposition have to be very careful once the try has been scored. North could now miss a number of games after fellow player Mike Brown was ruled out with a similar knock . The collision appeared accidental but it was deemed dangerous enough to send off the number eight . ‘George is OK, he’s come round, he’s in the changing room and he is up and walking about. It’s a knock to his head which is not good. We will look after him and we will make sure that he comes back when he is right.’ Young claimed: ‘When you slow anything down in slow-mo things look a bit worse. But once the crowd gets on a referee’s back, and it was a young referee, there is only one decision that is going to happen. We felt it was harsh. ‘First and foremost we hope that George is all right. Nathan has gone looking for him to make sure he is OK, he’s not that type of person.’","George North was knocked out after a clash with Wasps Nathan Hughes .

"Shaun Maloney has branded Scotland’s crunch end-of-season clash with Ireland as ‘colossal’ — and vowed that Gordon Strachan’s men are capable of leaving Dublin with three more crucial points on the road to Euro 2016. The goalscoring hero when the two nations met last November at Parkhead, Maloney believes the pressure will be off the scale when the Celtic nations collide for the return at the Aviva Stadium on June 13. The Scots currently lie in third place in Group D, one point behind leaders Poland, level with world champions Germany and two points ahead of the Irish. Scotland currently lie in third place in Group D after Saturday's 6-1 victory over Gibraltar . It has been a hugely encouraging opening five games to the qualifying campaign as Scotland aim to reach the nation’s first major finals since the 1998 World Cup in France. And Maloney insists Strachan’s side can grab the win that would all but end Ireland’s hopes of reaching France next year if they reprise their form against the Irish four months . ago. However, he admitted Scotland’s 3-1 home defeat to England four days later serves as a reminder not to let standards slip. ‘The Ireland game in June is going to be absolutely colossal,’ said Maloney, who now plays with Chicago Fire in America’s Major League Soccer. Scotland have enjoyed a hugely encouraging opening five games to the qualifying campaign . ‘The pressure on both sides will just build and build as we get closer. But I think we can go there and win the game. ‘However, we have to know that we can also lose it if we are not as good as we have been in recent games. ‘Look at our game against Ireland in November and the Poland away game when we drew 2-2. We played well and got results. ‘But then look at the England match, when we were a little bit off it. The better side defeated us. ‘So we have to be very aware of why we have got ourselves into this position and what we need to continue doing.’ Maloney insists Scotland’s ability to handle the intense pressure ahead of that first Ireland match in Glasgow and to emerge with a fine win was a key moment in the development of the team under Strachan. Shaun Maloney was the goalscoring hero when the two nations met last November at Parkhead . And he warned it will be the turn of the Irish in June to see if they can handle the heat of what is now a must-win match for Martin O’Neill’s side. ‘The pressure when we played Ireland at Celtic Park was huge,’ said Maloney, whose two goals in Scotland’s 6-1 win over Gibraltar on Sunday leaves him as the highest scorer in Strachan’s squad with a total of six. ‘It was a pressure for a match (against Ireland) that I hadn’t felt for a long time. So for the team to cope with that was a pretty big step. ‘I think we’ve made some pretty big steps in the last 18 months. But that was probably as big a one we’ve made as a group of players for a while. ‘The pressure will now be magnified for the Irish being at home and it’s a brilliant game to be involved in. ‘I have learned, though, that they are only brilliant if you win them.

"As the Wembley clock ticked over into the 89th minute, the booming PA system kicked in and proclaimed that Danny Welbeck was England's man of the match. Sometimes the sponsors' choice is met with bewilderment, even derision. Not this time. The reaction was warm applause from all four corners of the stadium - universal acknowledgement and appreciation. Welbeck had been excellent, by some distance the stand-out player.

Welbeck has scored eight goals in 29 appearances for Arsenal this season but has six in four qualifiers for England. On a productive night, Welbeck blasted in the shot that led to Wayne Rooney's opener, stooped to divert home England's second, had three other shots on goal and tormented the Lithuanian defence with his pace, power and passing. The goal augmented his international goal tally to 14 - drawing level with Paul Scholes - and he duly became the leading scorer in Euro 2016 qualifying with six goals, one ahead of Israel's Omar Damari. Welbeck's touch map showed his influence right across the field, switching places with Rooney and Raheem Sterling in a dynamic front three that linked up seamlessly throughout.

Pushed out to the wing to accommodate the in-form Olivier Giroud, Welbeck has all-too-often looked a spare part in Arsenal colours this season following his £16m move from Manchester United last September. The fact his England goal tally for the campaign is just two shy of his club return speaks volumes - perhaps Arsene Wenger should ask Roy Hodgson for advice on how to get the best out of the frontman. Because he looks a man transformed on international duty - while with Arsenal, the wide berth is regarded as something of a snub, inhibiting his performance. With England it somehow plays to his strengths. With the Three Lions on his chest, Welbeck is content and confident, raising his game to a level rarely seen for the Gunners. There he can be aloof, slow and ineffective. The memes that often go viral on Twitter portraying Welbeck as a World Cup winner or with the Ballon d'Or are very much tongue-in-cheek but he can rise above the mockery. At the moment, Welbeck is unlikely to displace Giroud, who has 17 goals in 26 games this season, but Friday night's electric performance proves that he can perform in a wide position - on both flanks. Wenger should liberate him and say 'you're playing wide for the foreseeable future, but make it your own. Get the head down, get the legs pumping. When you run at opposition defences, it is a frightening proposition. Inevitably, positive play will lead to more goals. And more goals will lead to a sustained title challenge.'

With goals comes the confidence to deliver against the top teams as well, in the Premier League, Champions League and Euro 2016 when it rolls around. We now have the blueprint. Let's hope we see Danny deliver.","England beat Lithuania 4-0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on Friday .

"Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck has pulled out of the England squad because of a knee injury he suffered in Friday's 4-0 win over Lithuania. Welbeck sustained the injury in the second half of the victory at Wembley and was replaced in the 77th minute. The Football Association confirmed on Saturday that Welbeck had been sent back to Arsenal. Danny Welbeck has been sent back to Arsenal after picking up a knee injury in England's win over Lithuania . Welbeck scored England's second in the 4-0 win but will not be present for the friendly against Italy in Turin . The striker will therefore not take part in Tuesday's friendly against Italy in Turin.

Manchester City midfielder James Milner has left and did not play against Lithuania as he has a knee problem . Leighton Baines has gone back to Everton as Roy Hodgson wants to give Kieran Gibbs a cap in Turin . Hodgson told FA TV: 'We knew we were going to be losing Raheem Sterling who had an injection last night on an on-going injury and hopefully that will help him as we go forward. 'We have a problem with James Milner who had to leave, we decided to let Leighton Baines go home and of course we lost Danny Welbeck who unfortunately picked up a slight knee injury (against Lithuania). 'So those four players won't be with us going forward but it means a chance for the other guys in the squad to show what they can do. 'We are going to bring Ryan Bertrand in because with Leighton Baines gone we are now left with only one recognised left-back which is Kieran Gibbs and we wanted two recognised left-backs for both games.' Ryan Bertrand (right) has been called up from Southampton as cover after Baines left Hodgson's squad . Nine players have withdrawn from the squad since it was announced. Daniel Sturridge, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Fraser Forster and Danny Rose all pulled out through injury last week. That means Hodgson has just 17 outfield players to choose from for the game against the country that beat England in their World Cup opener in Manaus last June.

Ideye missed the weekend's 3-0 loss at Manchester City due to a knee problem that has subsequently forced him to pull out of the Nigeria squad.

"Referees' chief Mike Riley has called for video technology to be trialled after the latest case of mistaken identity saw the wrong West Brom player sent off at Manchester City. Gareth McAuley was dismissed after just 89 seconds of the Baggies' defeat for a foul on Wilfried Bony that was actually committed by team-mate Craig Dawson. Referee Neil Swarbrick later apologised for the error while a furious West Brom manager Tony Pulis demanded the introduction of two manager challenges per game. Neil Swarbrick sent off West Brom's Gareth McAuley for a challenge actually committed by Craig Dawson . Referees' chief Mike Riley has called for video technology to be trialled in the wake of that blunder . West Brom defender Dawson (right) makes the original challenge on Wiflried Bony just outside the area . The Ivorian striker heads to the ground under Dawson's clumsy challenge but managed to get back up . Bony continues but McAuley  comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area . Bony goes to ground again under McAuley's challenge, leading to the dismissal of the West Brom player . BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him . Swarbrick's blunder is the third case of mistaken identity in a calendar year following Roger East's dismissal of Sunderland's Wes Brown for bringing down Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao last month and a red card for Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs, who was sent off by Andre Marriner when it was Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who had handled a shot from Chelsea's Eden Hazard last March. Riley, general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), acknowledged that now was the time to test replays. 'I think football as a whole has to look at how we can enhance refereeing performances through the use of technology,' he said. 'We've been open-minded to things like the goal-decision system which has made a great difference and a great benefit to referees in the Premier League. 'We need to see what other technology can be used to get refereeing decisions more accurate.' Riley, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, added that he had spoken to Swarbrick since his gaffe but would not confirm whether he would be selected for the next round of Premier League matches. City went on to win the match 3-0 as they try to keep their Premier League title hopes alive until the final day . Following McAuley's dismissal City ensured a miserable week, which included defeats to Burnley and a Champions League exit in Barcelona, ended on a high at a sunny Etihad Stadium. In a one-sided encounter that often resembled a training ground match of attack versus defence Wilfried Bony's first goal for the home side, a neat finish from close range, set them on their way on 27 minutes. A horrendous defensive mix-up allowed Fernando to tap in City's 1,000th Premier League goal before the break and David Silva deflected substitute Stevan Jovetic's low drive home to complete a dark afternoon for the Black Country visitors. The win, which featured 43 shots, eased some of the pressure on City boss Manuel Pellegrini amid reports he will be sacked in the summer if his side end the season trophyless. Ex-Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard, who started the match in place of the injured Yaya Toure, defended the Chilean. 'He has been a pleasure to work with and he's a very good man,' he said. 'He's a very experienced manager, a very good manager, and I don't think there is any finger-pointing at any individual for the recent form.' Frank Lampard has proved himself to be a readily capable deputy in midfield for the injured Yaya Toure . Lampard, who will join sister club New York City FC at the end of the season, admitted tough questions may well be asked in the summer. 'Judgements will be made at the end of the season and that is fair enough,' he added. Pellegrini himself dismissed claims that Chelsea would not surrender their six point lead at the summit. After joking: 'Please, no questions about the sack,' he said 'I don't think they are a winning machine all the time. 'I am sure form now until the end of the season every team will drop points. 'You never know what will happen when you have to play for another 24 points.'

"Peter Schmeichel has picked his #one2eleven of stars he  played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club on Sky Sports. The former Manchester United goalkeeper has focussed heavily on his time at Old Trafford, but the best player he says he has ever played with was actually at Danish club Brondby. Scroll down to find out who Schmeichel says was better to play with than Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and David Beckham, among others. Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. Peter Schmeichel has picked his #one2eleven of stars he played alongside throughout his career . GOALKEEPER: PETER SCHMEICHEL . I've only ever played with myself in goal. I would never do that, normally. But I'm in goal. DEFENDER: GARY NEVILLE . This week he was pundit of the year. That is so typical of Gary Neville. That's him. Whenever he sticks his head to something, he wants to be the best. He probably wasn't the biggest talent, but pure will and so dependable. This guy was unbelievable. You could depend on him. DEFENDER: JAAP STAM . I only played with him for one year and that was a very successful year, winning the treble. He was awesome. I took up smoking that year because I had nothing to do. I was up against the goalpost smoking because I had Jaap in front of me. He was  big, strong, quick, unbelievably quick. This guy was quick on half a yard, three yards, 20 yards, 50 yards. Jaap Stam lifts the Premier League trophy as he had a very successful year alongside Schmeichel . DEFENDER: STEVE BRUCE . He was there when I arrived at Manchester United. He was a really good friend. I ended up living next door to him, so he looked after me and my family. I've never played with a player so brave. He was never quick. He was slow, but unbelievable. He could read the game. He was never, ever, ever scared to sacrifice himself in order to do one tiny little thing for the good of the team. DEFENDER: DENIS IRWIN . What can you say about Denis Irwin that hasn't been said before? Doing this team I'm thinking about as a defender you'd remember what mistakes they made. I couldn't come up with a single mistake. So dependable, so reliable. His personality was really, really good for the back four of the team because we had so many outspoken personalities. He would be the guy in between. Set pieces. Fantastic shooting technique, and he would score goals from open play as well. Not many full-backs do that. Former Manchester United player Steve Bruce (left) features in the goalkeeper's best XI he played with . MIDFIELDER: DAVID BECKHAM . What David Beckham has done with his life, people will remember him for that. I hope people won't forget how good a player he was. Not only was he a good player but he is the one guy with the best kicking technique I've ever seen in my life. That came from talent to begin with. Hard work. He was one of the guys who took lessons off what Eric Cantona did. Doing stuff on your own for instance. No-one did that at Manchester United. David Beckham never cut a corner. He got his rewards. MIDFIELDER: ROY KEANE . A person of many different things but for 90 minutes when we played football this guy was unbelievable. I can't remember anyone who had the energy to run box to box, or 120 if it went to extra time. Keep doing the same thing, keep doing the same thing. Driving everybody to do the same. In his prime he was probably one of the best midfield players in the world. MIDFIELDER: PAUL SCHOLES . When I came to United he was a kid back then, playing in the youth team, but he was a striker. You could see there was something very special about him. His technique was incredible. He was converted into a midfield player. Scholes's passes, any kind of distance, from one yard to 40 yards, they were always accurate. Roy Keane (from left to right), David Beckham and Ryan Giggs all make it from Schmeichel's United days . MIDFIELDER: RYAN GIGGS . We know the goal he scored in the semi-final against Arsenal. Unbelievable thing to do. It's been shown time and time again because it is the best goal ever scored in the FA Cup. From 16 years of age to this year, to be able to perform at that level, to give the team so much, this guy has got to be the best Premier League player of all time. What he has given Manchester United and what he still gives Manchester United is fantastic. MIDFIELDER: MICHAEL LAUDRUP . Probably the best player I've ever played with. It's a shame he hasn't played in this country but this is a guy who played in one of the best Barcelona teams ever. He made the journey to Madrid, and played in one of the best Madrid teams ever. Won everything that football has to offer. STRIKER: ERIC CANTONA . The king. Changed everything for us. We had one season in 95 we were struggling. We really, really didn't play the way we should. This guy just changed everything. A different approach to games. Unbelievable. Schmeichel has chosen Michael Laudrup (left) as the best ever player he played alongside at Brondby .","Peter Schmeichel named his #one2eleven XI on The Fantasy Football Club on Sky Sports .

"Brazil responded to World Cup humiliation, shipping 10 goals in their final two games, to bringing back one of their grittiest former captains. Dunga was handed the responsibility of rebuilding a fallen team from the ashes of a 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany and 3-0 loss at the hands of Holland. His appointment was a controversial one among Brazil supporters, having guided his country in a lacklustre 2010 World Cup before he was sacked the last time. Brazil defender David Luiz looks devastated after the final whistle at the Mineirao Stadium in Belo Horizonte where the World Cup hosts had just been hammered 7-1 by eventual winners Germany . The Germans huddle to celebrate their fifth goal as the shell-shocked Brazilians head back to the centre . Dunga (right) has stepped up to take the Brazil job and has impressed with six wins from six matches . But when a nation was so embarrassed in their own backyard, a strong head was needed to take control and the 1994 World Cup winner was deemed the man for the job. ‘We want to build a modern, compact, aggressive team but without losing the essence of Brazilian football - the dribble and the creativity,’ Dunga said in Paris ahead of playing France. Six wins from six matches, clean sheets in the first five of those and only one goal conceded plus fourteen scored is the perfect response to former manager Luiz Felipe Scolari’s failings last summer. Dunga has encouraged his full backs to sit deeper, opting for Porto’s Danilo and Chelsea’s Filipe Luis on the flanks despite the more attack-minded Marcelo performing well for Real Madrid. Barcelona’s right back Dani Alves has also been a major casualty of the World Cup and Dunga has waved goodbye to Jo and Fred up front, who sound more like characters from a Last of the Summer Wine episode and played like them, too. Neymar, Philippe Coutinho, Willian and Filipe Luis complete a drill during Brazil training in Paris . Thiago Silva takes a selfie in the gym with Willian (left), Marcelo (centre) and Neymar (right) The goalkeeper, Julio Cesar, had to go and Botafogo stopper Jefferson is performing strongly, but being challenged by Valencia’s Diego Alves for the No 1 spot. Thiago Silva is struggling to get back into the side at centre-back alongside Paris Saint-Germain team-mate David Luiz, even though his performances in the World Cup were praised and he missed the mauling by Germany due to injury. In Silva’s absence after he missed the first match, a 1-0 win against Colombia, due to injury, Atletico Madrid’s Miranda has forged a strong partnership with Luiz. The captaincy has also been taken off him and handed to Neymar, who has responded with six goals in as many games. They have more exciting options up front; Shakhtar Donetsk striker Luiz Adriano is currently this season’s Champions League top-scorer and he is vying for a place as their No 9 with Diego Tardelli, who netted a double in a 2-0 win against Argentina. Silva (left) is struggling to get back into the side ahead of Miranda at centre back for Brazil . Neymar has scored six goals in six games since the World Cup and has been in fine form . There are still two places available in Brazil’s attacking midfield three alongside Neymar, and Chelsea’s Oscar and Willian are front-runners. Their pressing attacking play, instilled by Jose Mourinho, is a facet to forward players which particularly impresses Dunga. But another name emerging is 23-year-old Hoffenheim forward Roberto Firmino, who scored a 25-yard bullet to win their last match against Austria after being included in the squad for the first time. He is expected to start against France. Philippe Coutinho, brutally left out of the World Cup squad by Scolari, is another banging on the door, especially with his performances for Liverpool. Philippe Coutinho has been a star performer for Liverpool in recent months and will hope to shine for Brazil . Roberto Firmino (centre) is all smiles as he competes in a training drill at the Stade de France on Wednesday . Maintaining a core from the World Cup, Fernandinho, Ramires, Luiz Gustavo, have all been given chances in the middle. Dunga has also been experimenting with some nostalgic choices. He has just recalled 31-year-old Robinho to the squad, even though he has had a mediocre spell back in Brazil with Santos on loan from AC Milan. He is a favourite of Dunga, but not of the fans. Back in October, Kaka, another surprise omission from the World Cup, also got a late call-up as a replacement for the friendlies against Argentina and Japan. He came on for the last eight minutes against Argentina and 14 against Japan (a game they won 4-0) but has not made it into the latest squad.

"Milos Raonic gatecrashed a party seemingly reserved for the best four players in the world by shocking Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open. World number one Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - the Scot who is fourth in the ATP World Tour rankings - were confirmed as semi-final opponents on Thursday and second-best-in-the-world Roger Federer duly followed them into the last four with a 6-4 6-0 victory over Tomas Berdych.

The sixth seed from Canada looked like he might be heading out after losing the first set inside 36 minutes but he rallied to save three match points in an epic second-set tie-break, forcing a decider. Raonic, who fired 19 aces and saved six break points, finally ended the Spaniard's perfect record against Canadians by earning a crucial break in the third and clinching a 4-6 7-6 (12/10) 7-5 victory. He told atpworldtour.com: 'At the moments when I was playing those match points, it didn't really feel like match points. 'It was just like another point that I was trying to get through... (I was) just sort of going through the paces at that moment of what do I need to do now, not really signifying it as a match point.'

But Federer broke him in the seventh to go 4-3 up, and seemed to be into his groove from then on as he breezed through the second set. Federer said: '(It's) not just another win, but another win against a top 10 player; against Berdych, who has played me tough in recent years.'

"Maria Sharapova's life-changing move from Siberia to Florida as a seven-year-old propelled her on a path to fame and fortune but she says she would never turn her back on her mother country. It is sometimes easy to forget that five-times grand slam champion Sharapova, the world's highest-paid female athlete, is actually Russian until you witness her conduct a post-match press conference in her native tongue. With £21.4million in prize money alone, a string of lucrative endorsements, her own sweet business and even a famous boyfriend she is the living embodiment of the American dream. Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova poses with Tania Bryer during their interview on CNBC . Sharapova opens up about her past in the episode of CNBC Meets with host Tania Bryer . Yet, Sharapova baulks at the idea that she would want to trade her Russian passport for an American one, as former Czech Martina Navratilova did early in her glittering career. 'I would have if I wanted to (change citizenships) but it's never been actually a question in my family or in my team whether I wanted to change citizenships,' the Russian told CNBC in an interview to be screened on Wednesday. Sharapova, who won the Wimbledon title aged 17, still gives her all for Russia in the Fed Cup and was a torch bearer at the Sochi Winter Olympics a year ago. She said her Russian heritage moulded her instincts. Sharapova carries the Olympic torch during the opening ceremony in  Sochi . Sharapova won the Wimbledon title when she was just 17 back in 2004 . 'It is about the family environment, it is about the rich culture,' the 27-year-old said. 'Just life experiences that I look back to and I know that for so many years I was shaped into the individual I was from those experiences. 'And not necessarily simply the country, but the people, the mentality and the toughness and that never giving up attitude.'

Sharapova competes at Indian Wells last week . She beat the American in the 2004 Wimbledon final and again a few months later but lost the next 16, most recently in this year's Australian Open final. But Sharapova said their rivalry still burned strong. 'She's at the peak of her career. I am now number two in the world,' she said. 'I feel like we're still driven and hungry to be the best tennis players. 'I don't think anyone in the tennis world believed that, in 10 years' time, we would still be rivals.

"Sabine Lisicki staved off three match points before battling into the last four at the BNP Paribas Open on Thursday, the German edging out defending champion Flavia Pennetta 6-4, 6-7, 7-6 in an enthralling contest. The 24th seed advances to face Jelena Jankovic in the semi-finals on Friday after the Serb progressed when Ukrainian qualifier Lesia Tsurenko retired from their last eight encounter with an ankle injury while trailing 6-1 4-1. Lisicki nearly sealed a straight sets win when she earned her first match point while holding a 5-4 advantage in the second before the Italian produced a magical shot to spark a rally that leveled the match. Sabine Lisicki celebrates on match point as she beat Flavia Pennetta in Indian Wells . Pennetta had three match points but the defending champion eventually crashed out . Pennetta then forged three match points of her own at 5-4 in the decider before Lisicki fought back to claim victory in a tiebreaker. 'It's unbelievable,' Lisicki said in a courtside interview. 'It's such a great feeling to be part of such a great match. She saved a match point with an unbelievable backhand. I could not have done much different there and then I saved three match points in the third set. 'It was just an unbelievable feeling to play in front of all of you,' she added for the fans. Former champion Jankovic, meanwhile, broke an error-prone Tsurenko twice to breeze through the opening set in 22 minutes and twice more in the second before the Ukrainian walked across to her opponent and told her the match was over. 'It's never nice to end a match in that way,' Serb Jankovic, 30, said on another hot day at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. 'In the second set, she started limping and I saw that she had some problem. 'I had to just focus on my game and try to make as many balls as possible in the point. I was feeling pretty good out there. I was playing my game and waiting for my chances to execute. I was solid. Jelena Jankovic also progressed after Lesia Tsurenko retired from their last eight encounter with an injuy . 'I'm really sorry she got injured. She has had such a great tournament, she has beaten a lot of great players in the draw. Unfortunately she couldn't play a great match today.' Tsurenko, ranked 85th in the world, injured her right ankle during her upset of sixth-seeded Canadian Eugenie Bouchard in the previous round and was noticeably restricted in her movement against Jankovic. She failed to hold serve in the second and sixth games of the match to be swept aside in the opening set before calling for her trainer to re-tape her ankle. Tsurenko, who double-faulted five times during the curtailed match, was again broken in the first and fifth games of the second set before she retired. The other semi-final will be contested by Romanian Simona Halep and top seed Serena Williams, back at Indian Wells after a 14-year boycott of the event where she alleged she had suffered racist abuse from fans. American Williams, who clinched her 19th grand slam singles title at this year's Australian Open, and world No 3 Halep both advanced from the quarters on Wednesday.

"You probably associate Italian football with defenders. And you'd be right; Franco Baresi, Giuseppe Bergomi, Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro defended the blue shirt with style and steel. Those thoroughbreds made goal prevention an art. But the Azzurri also pride themselves on their goalscorers. From thick-necked battering rams to heaven-sent magicians. Times have changed. Last week an excellent column by Gazzetta dello Sport's Fabio Licari bemoaned the lack of goalscoring options available to national coach Antonio Conte. It's an uncomfortable feeling shared by fans. Italy's national team are famous for their defenders, such as Paolo Maldini, who played with style and steel . Italy are struggling for strikers... Defender Giorgio Chiellini (second right) is top scorer since the World Cup . Euro 2016 is 15 months away and the four-times world champions don't have a regular source of goals. Agricultural defender Giorgio Chiellini is the top scorer of the Conte era (since the 2014 World Cup) with two strikes. The Legends . Nostalgia for the old guys grows stronger by the game. Articles lionise yesterday's sharpshooters. The adored Giuseppe Meazza, after whom Inter and Milan's stadium is named, shot Italy to glory in the 1930s. The Azzurri's late 1960s and World Cup 1970 renaissance owed much to the thunderous force of Cagliari idol Luigi Riva. Another granite-faced striker, Giorgio Chinaglia enjoyed a short but colourful career with the national team in the early and mid-1970s. In 1982 Paolo Rossi spearheaded his country's third World Cup win with a craftier, subtle approach. There was a brief return to the dominant, blockbuster forward with the selfless Gianluca Vialli and blunderbuss Christian Vieri. Perhaps the most famous and popular modern Italian attacker, the masterly Roberto Baggio, played alongside Vialli and Vieri at World Cups, bewitching the football-loving world. His goals drove his team to the 1994 World Cup final. In the past, players such as Giuseppe Meazza, after whom Inter and Milan's stadium is named, shone . Paolo Rossi spearheaded Italy to the World Cup in 1982 with a craftier, more subtle approach . Elsewhere, Giorgio Chinaglia (left, pictured with Pele) and Roberto Baggio (right) live long in the memory . State of the Nation . It doesn't help Conte that four out of five of Serie A's top scorers are foreign. Juventus' Carlos Tevez, Gonzalo Higuain of Napoli and Palermo's Paolo Dybala are Argentinian, while Milan star Jeremy Menez is from France. Only Luca Toni (Verona) is Italian, but he is 37 and his career in the national team ended in 2009. Tevez's principal partner at Juve, Alvaro Morata, is a Spaniard. Inter's regular striker force of Mauro Icardi and Rodrigo Palacio hail from the land of the Tango. Roma rarely use an orthodox centre-forward, but rely on the pace of Ivorian ex-Arsenal man Gervinho. Simone Zaza and Ciro Immobile are Conte's first choice partnership. After a typically honest but fruitless performance in Italy's 2-2 draw in rain-lashed Bulgaria on Saturday, Zaza admitted: 'I was not satisfied with my performance.' Only Luca Toni is playing well in Serie A at the moment, but he retired from international football in 2009 . Simone Zaza (pictured), along with Ciro Immobile, are Antonio Conte's current first choice partnership . The Sassuolo man was subbed after 58 minutes of the Euro 2016 group H qualifier. Journalist and broadcaster Massimo Callegari says: 'Zaza has good technique and physical attributes, but needs to be more consistent and a bit calmer. When he is having a bad game he loses self-control and gets booked too often. He loses focus.' Immobile is suffering from a lean spell in the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund. The Neapolitan is a direct, tidy player, but his confidence is low. Mattia Destro, on loan at Milan from Roma, is in a similar mess. A classic box player, Destro is only as good as the service he receives. Milan' s struggles have reduced his efficacy and dampened his spirit. And before you ask, Liverpool's Mario Balotelli isn't Conte's cup of tea, to put it diplomatically. Mario Balotelli posted a picture of him in a mask to show his feelings after being left out of the Italian squad . Conte does not have a large pool of strikers to choose from, and many are going through a barren spell . The only good news from that draw in Sofia was Eder's stunning 84th minute equaliser. The Brazil-born Sampdoria firecracker, unwanted by Selecao chief Dunga, has the flair and unpredictability to give Italy back its goals and smile. At 28 years of age, it's unlikely Eder will make the impact of Baggio or even World Cup 1990 saviour Toto Schillaci. He might get his adopted nation through a difficult patch though. England have been warned. Ranked by the joy they gave Italian football fans, here are five of the Azzurri' s most cherished netbusters: . Giuseppe Meazza . The undisputed leader. Meazza (1910-1979), known as the Da Vinci of football, was acrobatic, a master dribbler and had an unerring shot. The first poster boy of calcio, he scored 33 goals in 53 international games. Roberto Baggio . Anyone who saw the 1994 World Cup knows the majesty of Baggio. Enduring more aches and gripes than the cast of Dad's Army, the gutsy genius dragged his team to the final. 'Roby' also shone at the '90 and '98 World Cups. 27 goals in 56 matches. Paolo Rossi . His early performances at the 1982 World Cup were pallid. But, with the unbending support of his manager Enzo Bearzot, the nippy little poacher sprung into life in the knockout stages, scoring six times, including a hat-trick against Brazil. 20 goals, 48 matches. Luigi Riva . Still Ia Nazionale's top scorer with 35 goals from 42 games, Riva's shots measured 140km/h, which would be closer to 200km/h with modern balls. Known as the Thunderclap, uncompromising Riva was instrumental to the Italy side which finished runners-up at the 1970 World Cup. Christian Vieri . Despite all the headlines regarding his hectic private life, brilliant 'Bobo' plundered five goals in a cautious Italy team at the 1998 World Cup, and four more in 2002 in Japan and Korea. A bulldozing, brave target man with outstanding aerial ability, he gave his team a brutish, British edge. 23 goals, 49 matches.

"Move over Usher and Chris Brown, because there's a new nimble-toed dancing phenomenon in town. And he goes by the name of Cristiano Ronaldo. Primarily known throughout the globe for his dazzling footwork on the pitch, the Real Madrid star swapped his football boots for some dancing shoes whilst promoting his new CR7 footwear range. Picking up a box of his personally branded kicks, the Portugal captain looks (relatively) at home as he tears up the stage with some, frankly, mesmerising moves - much like he does regularly at the Santiago Bernabeu. Cristiano Ronaldo struts his stuff on the dance floor in an advertisement for his new footwear range . 2014 Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo pulls out a moonwalk whilst fully suited and booted . It goes without saying that we have all grown to love his twinkletoed genius on the turf, but this advert may take some getting used to. Having recently split from long-term girlfriend Irina Shayk, there's no knowing what sort of damage the 2014 Ballon d'Or winner will cause on the dance floor with moves like these. However, it hasn't been plain sailing all the way for Ronaldo's big launch after sponsors Nike, who pay him around £5.5m a year, recently forced their client to withdraw a line of trainers from his new collection in the belief that it competed directly with one of their own. The Real Madrid star is known for his nimble feet on the pitch, but ditched the boots to get his groove on . According to reports in Portugal, Ronaldo would have needed Nike’s prior approval and that was not forthcoming when they became aware of the potential conflict of interests. On a more positive note the Goal.com Rich List reported on Thursday that the-30-year-old is now the wealthiest footballer in the world with a personal fortune of £152m - some £7m more than his rival Lionel Messi. Maybe the mini Argentine needs to start dusting off his tango steps if he is to get back on level terms with his loyal adversary. It would certainly make for interesting viewing.

"Freddie Woodman has been warned by Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer. He has been warned not to drift into obscurity. Woodman – the England Under-19 goalkeeper who is currently Tim Krul's No.2 at St James' Park – was presented with the Jack Hixon Trophy by Shearer earlier this week. Hixon was the Tyneside scout who spotted the future England captain and the prize in his name recognises the best talent in the city. Freddie Woodman walks on the pitch during a Newcastle United training session in March . Freddie (right) takes a catch as he practises with his father Andy during a training session in Newcastle . Woodman, who turned 18 this week, was a deserving recipient. He won the European Championships last summer, has been a regular on the United bench this season - despite his tender years - and starred in Newcastle's run to the last eight of the FA Youth Cup. Shearer, though, has told Woodman all of that will count for nothing if he fails to come good on his undoubted potential. 'It's been a brilliant 12 months,' the stopper told Sportsmail. 'I have seen things around the first-team that I wouldn't have otherwise done this early in my career. 'To win the award was an honour. Alan said to me that some of the names who have won it have not gone on to achieve what they should have done. He said hopefully I would. I certainly intend do.' Woodman's chances of making it big will undoubtedly be aided by the presence of Krul. The young custodian was Newcastle's penalty-shootout hero during last month's victory at Sunderland in the FA Youth Cup, mimicking the World Cup antics of the Dutchman. Krul made headlines around the world when he saved two spot-kicks in Holland's shootout win over Costa Rica in Brazil. And Woodman, whose dad Andy is Magpies goalkeeping coach, said: 'Every time we do penalties I think of Tim. 'The shootout at Sunderland was one of my best moments in football, up there with the Euros. Shearer has told Woodman to make use of his potential and prove that he can be a great goalkeeper . Newcastle's No 2 keeper Woodman was presented with the Jack Hixon Trophy by Shearer earlier this week . 'The feeling of saving the penalty and the fans singing my name was a moment I' ll remember for a long time. It was like the kid coming out of me. For that five minutes I was on top of the world. 'But I've to give credit to Tim. I remember being at home watching that game against Costa Rica and when he came on and did what he did I couldn't have been happier. 'Earlier in the tournament, when Holland played Australia, he rang me up and invited me out to Brazil, courtesy of him. 'That was incredible. A lot of people might think Tim doesn't have time for the young keepers, but he's absolutely top class. 'He works with me and teaches me. He'll say when I'm rubbish and say when I'm good. That's been massive for me. 'He's really taken me under his wing and has said I can take the same path as him. Tim Krul (right) has taken Woodman under his wing at Newcastle and is teaching him the tricks . Woodman says Newcastle's No 1 goalkeeper Krul will 'say when I'm rubbish and say when I'm good' 'I would love to do that. He's up there as one of the best – and that's what I want to be.' London-born Woodman followed his dad to the North-East three years ago and, given his position on Alan Pardew's backroom team, he admits it wasn't easy to be accepted by his peers. 'It's brilliant having my dad as coach, but it's been hard as well,' he said. 'When I first came there as a lot of, ""You're only here because of your dad"". And I got that a lot. 'I felt I had to work 10 times harder than everyone else. I stayed back after training just to prove that I'm not just here because of my old man. 'But he's great with it. My dad played, it wasn't at the best level and he made mistakes. We talk about them to make sure I don't make those same mistakes. I have to take the right path professionally.' Woodman was on the bench at Spurs earlier in the season when Jak Alnwick needed lengthy treatment. It looked as though he was about to make his Premier League debut at just 17. Woodman is looking to get a first team opportunity from Newcastle manager John Carver this season . Woodman says he feels like he's 'having a kickabout with my mates' but will hope to get Carver's attention . 'When the gaffer turned around and said, ""Fred, get warmed up"", you do get a feeling where you think, ""Woah, this is big"",' he said. 'You get a burning feeling inside, but deep down I wanted to get on the pitch and show people that I'm ready, no matter how young I am. 'As soon as you're on the pitch though you forget everything and it feels like you're in the park. I feel like I'm having a kickabout with my mates because I love playing, hopefully I will keep that feeling for the rest of my career. I'm loving every minute right now.' Let's hope he continues to enjoy it, for if not, Shearer might have something to say.","Freddie Woodman won the Jack Hixon Trophy earlier this week .

"A sensational 82nd-minute strike from Ashley Smith-Brown snatched victory for England's U19s over Denmark in their UEFA elite qualifying opener in Bayeux on Thursday. England came from behind twice in the first half as Marcus Ingvartsen and Robert Skov's goals were cancelled out first by captain Izzy Brown and Demarai Gray as they went to the break 2-2. They couldn't be separated until Manchester City defender Smith-Brown pulled the trigger from outside the box and his left-footed shot thundered in off the underside of the cross bar. Ashley Smith-Brown snatched victory for England's U19s over Denmark in their UEFA elite qualifying opener . England: Angus Gunn (Man City), Ashley Smith-Brown (Man City), Ben Chilwell (Leicester), Harry Winks (Tottenham), Brendan Galloway (Everton), Joe Gomez (Charlton), Patrick Roberts (Fulham), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea), Izzy Brown (Chelsea), Charlie Colkett (Chelsea), Demarai Gray (Birmingham) Sub: Ola Aina (Chelsea) for Roberts 87 Not used: Freddie Woodman (Newcastle), Lewis Cook (Leeds), Bradley Fewster (Middlesbrough), Alex Kiwomya (Chelsea), Aaron Kuhl (Reading), Robert Dickie (Reading).

Referee: Marco Guida (Italy) Feverish closing stages followed at the Henry Jeanne Stadium as England fought to keep their lead with a player from either side sent off by the Italian referee Marco Guida. Jeppe Hansen went first for Denmark a minute after the final goal for an unseemly tackle on Colkett before Tottenham's Harry Winks received a second yellow card in the 87th minute. Ingvartsen's opener came from a long throw just six minutes in with the move immediately after Birmingham's Demarai Gray almost put England ahead after a cross from Charlie Colkett. They levelled when Ruben Loftus-Cheek found captain and fellow Chelsea star Izzy Brown, who despite having plenty of work to do evaded two defenders and beat keeper Daniel Iversen. Smith-Brown picks up the ball at the top of the box as England look to create something . The Manchester City defender turns inside as the Danish defence give him plenty of space . Smith-Brown fires off his bullet-like shot that cannons in off the crossbar and wins the match for England . Despite momentum going England's way and a number of chances going begging, Denmark were in the lead again in the 44th minute as Skov burst into the box and beat Angus Gunn for 2-1. In the same minute though Sean O’Driscoll’s side were back on terms as Gray flicked-on Roberts free-kick from the edge of the box with the help of a possible deflection. Neither side took the second half as their own with only half chances coming their way until Smith-Brown's goal came from seemingly nothing more than the Danish defence underestimating his ability from range and giving him too much space. England will play Azerbaijan in their second group match on Saturday.","Ashley Smith-Brown scored the 82nd-minute winner against Denmark .

"England under 19s made the perfect start to their European Championship qualifying campaign as they twice came from behind to beat Denmark 3-2 on Thursday night. Sean O'Driscoll's Young Lions trailed twice, to goals from Marcus Ingvartsen and Robert Skov, but hit back through Izzy Brown, Demarai Gray and Ashley Smith-Brown to claim an important win. England are in an Elite Round mini-group with Denmark, Azerbaijan and France as they bid to reach the Under 19 European Championship finals in Greece in July. Manchester City's Ashley Smith-Brown scored the winner as England's under 19s beat Denmark . With only the group winners qualifying for the tournament, it was imperative England started with a positive result in Bayeux, northern France and they did in a topsy-turvy game that saw both sides finish with 10 men. Having scored 15 goals in three matches against Belgium, Luxembourg and Belarus to breeze through the preliminary qualifying phase, England knew this week's fixture would represent a step up in quality. And they were rocked when Denmark took the lead just six minutes in - after the England defence failed to deal with a long throw-in, Ingvartsen was there to poke the ball home at the back post. England responded by seizing control of possession, but it was the half-hour mark before they equalised. Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek threaded a ball through to club-mate Brown and, brushing aside two Denmark defenders, he slotted the ball past goalkeeper Daniel Iversen. Brown came within inches of putting England in front soon after, but his powerful strike from 20 yards cannoned back off the crossbar. Izzy Brown, seen here playing for Chelsea in the FA Youth Cup, scored England's first goal . And when Fulham star Patrick Roberts teed up Loftus-Cheek, his shot was cleared off the line by Stefan Gartenmann. Given their dominance, it was frustrating that Denmark took the lead again four minutes before half-time. After a well-worked move, Skov found space just outside the box and fired past goalkeeper Angus Gunn into the far corner. To their credit, England responded immediately and it was 2-2 at the pause. Roberts swung in a free-kick from the right and Gray, the Birmingham City player, flicked in at the near post. After the excitement of the opening 45 minutes, the game entered a lull after the break before exploding to life again in the decisive final 10 minutes. Man City defender Smith-Brown collected the ball wide right, cut inside and fired home a missile from 20 yards that crashed in off the underside of the bar. The game ended with England's Harry Winks receiving a second yellow card and Denmark's Jeppe Hansen also dismissed for a bad tackle on Charlie Colkett.

"Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Douglas Costa has admitted he dreams of a move to the Premier League with title contenders Chelsea being his preferred destination. Costa, who has a release clause of more than £35million with the Ukrainian side, was originally linked with a move to La Liga giants Barcelona. However, the 24-year-old has revealed to FourFourTwo that both Manchester United and Chelsea had bids for him turned down in January, with Costa hoping a move to the latter could still take place. Shakhtar Donetsk ace Douglas Costa fights for the ball with David Alaba in the Champions League . Shakhtar midfielder Costa squares up to Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng at the Allianz Arena . He said: ‘I’d be really interested in moving to Chelsea – not only because everything Willian tells me about the club, but because I think that I’d be able to achieve everything I want having someone like Jose Mourinho by my side. ‘Since I left Brazil, I have worked with a marvellous coach (Mircea Lucescu) and got an idea of how much influence such a good professional can have in your football. ‘Now I think it’s time to try a new philosophy and I’m sure that Mourinho’s is the best around He’s always fighting for trophies.’ Costa and midfielder Franck Ribery vie for the ball during the UEFA Champions League second-leg . The current Premier League leaders had an increased offer of £18.7million for the Brazilian rejected in January, having already had an opening bid of £16million rejected days earlier. But because he was cup-tied for the Champions League the former Gremio man was only ever Mourinho's second choice. Instead Chelsea used the money raised from the sale of Andre Schurrle to sign Fiorentina midfielder Juan Cuadrado after activating the 26-year-old's £26.8million buy-out clause.","Douglas Costa has revealed he dreams of moving to the Premier League .

"Manchester United director David Gill has been elected as Britain's FIFA vice-president and insisted he would be a bullish presence on the world governing body. Gill, who is also vice-chairman of the Football Association, will succeed Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce in May and will have a four-year term on FIFA's executive committee. Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has said he wants Gill to be part of the 'awkward squad' on FIFA, asking tough questions and keeping an eye on financial decisions. Man United director and FA vice-chairman David Gill has been elected as Britain's vice-president at FIFA . Gill (left, pictured with Sir Bobby Charlton) is hoping to stamp his authority on FIFA when he takes up the role . Gill, pictured with Sir Alex Ferguson, left his role as Man United's chief executive in the summer of 2013 . Speaking at UEFA's Congress in Vienna, however, Gill said: 'I wouldn't use the word awkward, I've always viewed my role at Manchester United and then the FA and the Premier League to ask relevant and appropriate questions. I don't think that is being awkward that's just doing the job. 'I'm not being elected just to get another blazer with four letters on it, I'm trying to play a role and assist my other colleagues from UEFA and some very good people from around the world.' UEFA president Michel Platini, who persuaded Gill to change his mind and run for the post, added: 'We have to defend European football without breaking world football. A lot people like things as they are. As I told him 'You, the English, are never happy'. Now at least he will be able to express it directly in the ExCo instead of through the press.' Gill, 57, beat Football Association of Wales' president Trefor Lloyd Hughes by 43 votes to 10 in the election by UEFA's 54 member nations. UEFA president Michel Platini (right) persuaded Gill to run for the post at football's world governing body . Earlier, Lloyd Hughes and Scottish Football Association president Campbell Ogilvie failed in their attempt to be elected to UEFA's executive committee. They were among 12 candidates for seven seats - in the second round of voting Lloyd Hughes secured only a single one of the possible 54 votes. The new names on UEFA's executive committee include the former Croatia and Arsenal striker Davor Suker and Borislav Mikhailov, the former Reading and Bulgaria goalkeeper who was renowned for wearing a wig even in matches. UEFA's Congress also heard from the three challengers to Sepp Blatter's FIFA presidency with the incumbent himself also addressing the European delegates, but refusing to do as a candidate. Blatter made no reference to standing again for FIFA president but once again urged football to resist calls to boycott to the 2018 World Cup in Russia due to its involvement in the civil war in Ukraine. Dutch Football Association president Michael Van Praag was the most outspoken of Blatter's challengers, saying: 'The beautiful heritage of international football has been tarnished by accusations of corruption, bribery, nepotism and a waste of money.' Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan said many associations still did not have basic needs such as kits and pitches, adding: 'FIFA has been riding the wave of European football success and while the popularity has soared the image of the organisation has sadly declined.' Former Portugal international Luis Figo dismissed claims that UEFA is trying to take over FIFA, saying: 'Nobody feels that Europe wants to take over football.

"Things usually end badly for England in Turin. Italia 90 culminated in a tear-jerker in this city, as did the Euros in 1980, and David Beckham’s first game as captain was another defeat at the turn of the century. It was 1948 when England last won here and even Michael Caine’s cliff-hanger in The Italian Job, a heist film based around an England game in Turin, did not go to plan — and that was not even real. Roy Hodgson, too, admits his personal record playing Juventus when he was coaching in Italy was not up to much either, so there was no surprise when he and his captain Wayne Rooney insisted they were much keener to talk about the future than the past. England manager Roy Hodgson looks on during a press conference  ahead of the match against Italy . Harry Kane poses just days after grabbing his first international goal on his England debut . Here is the first real test for Hodgson’s new wave, playing away against one of the major European nations, even if both teams have something of an experimental feel to them. Hodgson chose to take a young squad to the World Cup in the hope that experience would pay off in the long run and he can go some way to claiming that it already has with seven wins out of seven, while others including Germany, Holland and Italy have stuttered amid the complacent environment that is the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Hodgson speaks to his players on the pitch in Turin ahead of Tuesday's friendly match against Italy . Southampton striker Graziano Pelle could be in line to start for Italy against England on Tuesday . Italy midfielder Antonio Candreva (second left) controls the ball as Italy prepare to take on England . Conte (fourth right) addresses his team as they look to put an end to England's seven wins . The manager remains rightly cautious about getting carried away on the basis of handsome victories against Slovenia and Lithuania. ‘I’m always frightened to say those things,’ said Hodgson, but he is quietly satisfied with almost everything that has happened since his team returned from Brazil. ‘You never know,’ he added. ‘Certainly, there seems to be a group and a talent pool that is growing all the time. Some of the talent that’s already been with us for a couple of years, I see signs of them becoming more comfortable, assured in their play not only with their clubs but with England. The teams we select have a lot of energy and pace around them. These are good qualities a team badly needs. Pace and energy mean you cause teams problems when you attack and when you defend it helps prevent any damage. ‘If we can keep this group of 20-odd players together, they’ll get more international experience and hopefully in a year’s time we might be stronger than we are today. ‘But I don’t feel we’re lagging any more. Or that other teams are moving forward faster than us. We’re keeping pace. By the finals in France, hopefully we’ll be closer to that.’ Perhaps they will if Harry Kane tackles the challenge of his first start as he did his first appearance. Or if another player emerges to demand a place in the team. Even then, the usual fear that England have qualified stylishly in the past only to malfunction during the tournaments, will remain. One of the reasons they have struggled when stepping up a level in recent tournaments has been because they lack the depth of players in defensive areas, including defensive midfield, to give the team a healthy balance. So it will be interesting to see how Phil Jones performs if he is deployed in midfield as expected. Wayne Rooney answers the questions from the press as England continue preparations for Italy .

Hodgson urged supporters to wait and judge his team in a series of friendlies being planned against what he called ‘top-class opponents, teams on a par with Italy’ next season. England will play France and Spain in November, assuming they all avoid the need to play off. They are away in Germany in March next year and are in talks for a friendly against Holland. ‘It will be much more relevant when we qualify,’ said Hodgson, who always seems to come over all misty-eyed when he returns to Italy and spoke with touching fondness of the moment he was invited by Massimo Moratti to coach Inter Milan. Antonio Conte was also emotional as he discussed his first return to the Juventus Stadium, although the Italy boss has more immediate problems amid suggestions that he regrets his decision to swap club football for the chance to lead the Azzurri to Euro 2016.

Already it has damaged his relationship with Juventus, the club he loves, where he played more than 400 games, many as captain and won three titles as coach. Conte, new to international management, has been swamped by controversies around an injury to Claudio Marchisio, which prompted a death-threat, but turned out not to be as bad as first feared and his decision to call-up Brazilian-born Eder, who will start tonight, and Argentina-born Franco Vazquez. ‘What am I missing, what am I lacking?’ said Conte. ‘I don’t know if I’m missing anything. Regardless of what’s going on I will keep working and moving forward. Sometimes I ask myself questions and don’t know the answers.’ Kane looks around at the huge Juventus Arena as he prepares to make his full debut against Italy .

The return of Buffon (right) provided a major boost to Italy ahead of their encounter against England . Gianluigi Buffon is fit to start after a fever but this Italian generation is near to the end and braced for a transitional phase. ‘There’s been a big turnover in terms of players and experience at every level and whenever that happens you need a minimum level of patience,’ said Conte. ‘You need to allow the players to grow without being critical at every opportunity. I don’t think this is helpful. ‘When I say we have to be left to work it’s because we have to work. We don’t have a lot of time because the European Championship is next year. All I can promise is that we can work very hard.’ The two teams are in different places. You would rather be Hodgson than Conte and yet we have heard this before. There were similar noises from both camps before they met in Manaus, nine months ago. Even if England prefer to look forward, history is against them in more ways than one.

"England and France will meet in a winner-takes-all showdown on Tuesday to determine which nation makes July's UEFA Under-19 European Championships in Greece. Both recorded victories on Saturday to maintain their perfect records and take their Elite Round qualifying group to the wire. England squeezed past Azerbaijan 1-0 in Bayeux thanks to a first-half winner from Manchester City's Ashley Smith-Brown, his second decisive goal in two matches. Ashley Smith-Brown scored England's winner as they recorded a vital result over Azerbaijan . France, meanwhile, beat Denmark 2-0 to lead the way on goal difference, meaning that Sean O'Driscoll's Young Lions must beat them in Saint-Lo to take the group's only qualifcation spot. As expected, England dominated possession and chances against Azerbaijan, but could only convert one of them. It came eight minutes before half-time when Smith-Brown collected the ball wide on the left, cut inside and curled a lovely shot into the far corner. Confidence was high in the England camp after twice coming from behind to beat Denmark 3-2 on Thursday and this game reverted to type almost immediately. Faced with an Azerbaijan team with 11 men behind the ball, England knew they would have to be patient and their first effort came from range when Fulham's Patrick Roberts saw a 25-yarder tipped over by goalkeeper Tolga Sahin. Sean O'Driscoll's England side must now beat France on Tuesday to qualify for the European Championships . Lewis Cook, of Leeds United, fired narrowly off target when debutant Aaron Kuhl, of Reading, picked him out on the edge of the penalty area. That pressure eventually told when right-back Smith-Brown marauded forward to score what would prove to be the game's decisive goal. The second-half, unsurprisingly, followed a similar pattern, with Roberts and Kuhl going close during its early stages. Azerbaijan's one and only attack of note culminated in Elnur Jafarov firing wide of the far post when well-placed. Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek had the ball in the net three minutes from time only to be flagged offside but the one goal was sufficient as England set up their showdown with France. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek saw a late goal disallowed for offside .

"Under-fire Italy coach Antonio Conte is determined to turn things around with the national team, despite reportedly receiving death threats in the days leading up to the Azzurri's friendly against England. Italy welcome Roy Hodgson's men for a glamour friendly at Juventus Stadium on Tuesday, just nine months since they beat the Three Lions in their World Cup opener. However, like England, their tournament ended with a group-stage exit, with former Juventus manager Conte subsequently brought in to replace Cesare Prandelli at the helm. Under-fire Italy coach Antonio Conte reportedly received death threats from angry Juventus fans . It has not been the easiest of rides so far, with tension heightened last week when the Italy coach reportedly received death threats from angry Juventus fans over the treatment of Claudio Marchisio. The midfielder, who netted the opener against England in Brazil, ruptured knee ligaments while warming up on the eve of Italy's Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria - a match the Azzurri required a late goal to draw 2-2. John Elkann, the president of the holding company which controls Juventus, also criticised Conte, who returns to his old stomping ground on Tuesday looking to build some positivity. Former Juventus boss Conte is determined to turn things around with the national team . 'The fans need to support Italy, so I think I have an excellent relationship with Italy fans,' he said. 'They know that we are working hard - myself, the players, everyone. We're all trying to work at a time which is not easy. 'So when everyone gives everything that they've got in what they're doing, you hope that is being appreciated.' This, Conte says, is a transitional period for the Azzurri as they attempt to blood in new, untested players. It is a big ask but one Conte is determined to carry on with, reciting a quote by former Olympic 200 metres champion Pietro Mennea in the pre-match press conference. Italy face England in a friendly just nine months since they beat the Three Lions in their World Cup opener . 'I know it will not be easy but I am carrying on in my work,' he said. 'Mennea said that, to achieve big dreams, one must make great effort.' The Italy coach's desire to find the right formula will see him tinker with the side against England, ahead of which he took the unusual step of naming his starting line-up. Uncapped Mirko Valdifiori and Southampton striker Graziano Pelle are amongst the starters, as are the vastly-experienced Giorgio Chiellini and Gianluigi Buffon. The latter's experience is more important than ever right now, with even the goalkeeper, capped 146 times, surprised by this week's events. 'Obviously the last few days have not been boring, by any means,' Buffon said, laughing. 'We can quite calmly say that. 'But it is also true that this sort of energy is better to really release than to bottle it up because that can ultimately lead to defeats.' Veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon will add some much-needed experience to Italian line-up . Southampton striker Graziano Pelle will start against England on Tuesday night .","Antonio Conte not expecting a hero's reception on his return to Juventus .

"Roy Hodgson's side travel to Turin in search of an eighth consecutive victory ahead of their international friendly date with Italy on Tuesday. England continued their recovery from a disastrous World Cup by defeating lowly Lithuania 4-0 on Friday night to maintain a six-point lead at the top of Euro 2016 qualifying Group E.
