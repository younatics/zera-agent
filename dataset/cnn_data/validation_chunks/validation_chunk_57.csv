"A teenager was left millimetres from death after a knifeman sliced open his chest and almost exposed his heart as he left a party with his twin brother. Tyler Gane, 16, and his brother Loui were with friends at a roundabout in Dilton Marsh, Wiltshire, when a man approached them and threatened the group. asking where they were from. When Loui questioned him back, the stranger pulled out a knife and stabbed Tyler as he stepped in to protect his brother on Saturday night. Tyler Gane, 16, was millimetres from death after a knifeman sliced open his chest, almost exposing his heart . The teenager was left with an eight inch wound from his shoulder to the centre of his chest, which nearly exposed his heart, and was rushed to hospital  in a serious condition. Police said he was 'lucky to be alive' because the wound was so deep and the blade miraculously missed his vital organs. Tyler has since returned home but doctors told him to rest and not return to school until after Easter. He said: 'I don't remember much. I don't remember actually getting stabbed. I remember walking off and all of my friends screaming. 'That's when I looked down and blood was all over my shirt. The paramedics were there trying to see how bad it was and taking off the jumper which I had on. 'That's when it started to sink in. That's when it hit me that I had actually been stabbed. The eight inch wound was so deep it almost struck his heart and police said Tyler was 'lucky to be alive' The teenagers were at a party on a roundabout known locally as Dilton Marsh Roundabout when they were approached by the unknown man on Saturday at about 11pm . 'It doesn't feel real. I'm still shocked. I think everyone is. Still people don't know why it happened or why he did it.' Loui suffered cuts to his hands and was also treated in Bristol's Southmead Hospital. Their mother Erika, 34, said: 'I was shocked. I don't understand why anybody would approach a group of children and do this. Tyler pictured in hospital after the attack. He is now recovering at home but will be off school for weeks . 'It's not like this is a dangerous city - it's a small town. He's lucky to still be here. 'Tyler has taken it very well. I don't think it has sunk in yet. he's had all his friends around him. 'It was completely random. I don't know what I would say to the attacker. To me, it proves he is not sorry because he hasn't come forward. He's not sorry and he's hiding like a coward. 'I'm looking at people and thinking they look like the description.' Detective inspector Paul Franklin said: 'He's first threatened the children and then when the two brothers have gone over to him, he slashed out at them with the knife causing one a very serious and deep lacerations to his chest, and the other brother some cuts to his arm. 'From that point, he has then run away up main road. It's completely unprovoked and at this time we have absolutely no idea who this man is. This could have been a murder inquiry quite easily.' The attacker is described as being aged between 20 and 30, with shortish black hair and wearing a blue jacket and either blue jeans or grey jogging bottoms.","WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"For those hoping global warming will bring more opportunities for a summer barbecue, there may be disappointment ahead - climate change is likely to make steaks and burgers far less appetising. In a major report on the impact of global warming on food, scientists have concluded that the quality of many meats and vegetables is due to decline at temperatures increase. The researchers predict that as heatwaves become more common, steaks and other meats are likely to become stringier and tougher - putting the traditional barbecue at risk. Beefburgers, like those above, could become far less appetising option on future BBQ's due to climate change . Popular vegetables like carrots are also likely to become less flavoursome and have a less pleasant texture. Potatoes are likely to suffer far more from blight, which rots the tubers and makes them inedible. Marine biologists have found that shellfish take on a sour flavour if they are reared in slightly acidified sea water. They warn that as the planet's oceans grow more acidic, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising. Climate change experts predict that over the next century, the acidity levels of the world's oceans could drop from pH8 to pH7.5. Many have warned this could lead to shrimps and prawns struggling to build the shells and skeletons they need to survive. Now, in the first study to test how ocean acidification could impact on the taste of seafood, researchers at the University of Gothenberg and Plymouth University, found it will also affect their taste. Shrimp raised in the water with a lower pH were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting, while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest. Onions could get smaller if temperatures early in the season increase while fruit and nut trees in some regions may not get cold enough to signal fruit development. The report, produced by scientists at the Univeristy of Melbourne, also warned that milk yeilds could decrease by up to 10-25 per cent as heatwaves grow more common. Lower levels of grain production could also hit dairy cattle, meaning their milk contains less protein, which would result in poorer quality cheese. Professor Richard Eckard, director of the pirmary industries climate challenges centre at the University of Melbourne, said: 'It’s definitely a wake up call when you hear that the toast and raspberry jam you have for breakfast, for example, might not be as readily available in 50 years time. 'Or that there may be changes to the cost and taste of food items we love and take for granted like avocado and vegemite, spaghetti bolognaise and even beer, wine and chocolate. 'It makes you appreciate that global warming is not a distant phenomenon but a very real occurrence that is already affecting the things we enjoy in our everyday lives, including the most common of foods we eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner.' The scientists assessed the impact of the changing climate on 55 foods grown in Australia and other parts of the world. It predicted that as weather conditions get warmer, with heatwaves and other extreme events increasing in frequency, agricultural production will be hit hard. Avocados will grow less plump and trees will carry less of the fruit as temperatures increase, the report warns . The cost of apples could rise as farmers try to combat damage from extreme temperatures on fruits like apples by using shade cloths. Heat stress will have a particular impact on meat production with cattle and chickens suffering in higher temperatures and affecting their appetite. This will mean meat is likely to be be tougher and more stingy. Pigs could have particular problems in the heat as they do not possess sweat glands. Avocados are also likely to get smaller in warmer temperatures as the plants get stressed while the trees themselves will flower far less. Dairy cows produce 10-25 per cent less milk in heat waves and their amount of protein in milk can also decline . Temperatures above 27 degrees can cause beetroot flowering stems to grow early and result in smaller bulbs, while the vegetable can also lose some of its distinctive red colouring in warmer temperatures. Professor David Karoly, an atmospheric scientists at the University of Melbourne and one of the co-authors of the report, said countries like Australia, where drought is already a major problem, are likely to be worse hit. He said: 'Global warming is increasing the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and bushfires affecting farms across southern and eastern Australia, and this will get much worse in the future if we don’t act. 'It’s a daunting thought when you consider that Australian farms produce 93% of the food we eat.'","Report by University of Melbourne warns that many foods are under threat .

"An elderly man decorating a relative's grave for Easter has been killed after the headstone fell on him. Stephan Woytack, 74, from Scranton, Pennsylvania, was struck in the head by the memorial on Monday at Saint Joseph's Cemetery in nearby Throop on Monday. He and his wife were attaching an ornament when it toppled, trapping him underneath. Scroll down for video . Scene: Stephan Woytack, 74, from Scranton, Pennsylvania, was struck in the head Monday at Saint Joseph's Cemetery in nearby Throop on Monday while standing with his wife . A cemetery caretaker told WNEP-TV the couple visits the grave several times a year and ties a cross to it. Caretaker Ed Kubilus says the bases of headstones often sink when the ground thaws, making them susceptible to tipping over. He said: 'They tie a cross to it every year, the both of them. And after they’re done tying the cross to it, they stand there, say prayers, and then they leave.' Bishop Joseph C. Bambera from the Dioceses of Scranton told The Times Tribune: 'It is unimaginable to think that a visit of a faithful couple to the grave of loved ones in anticipation of the celebration of Easter could have ended in such a tragic manner. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the deceased and his family.' Police and representatives from the coroner's office were on the scene for hours before moving the man's body.

"Almost 50 years ago, Nasa launched two men into space in the same spacecraft for the first time - a milestone for US human spaceflight. But  the groundbreaking mission isn’t necessarily remembered for this feat. Two hours into the mission, one of the pilots pulled out a contraband corned beef sandwich which sparked a controversial incident that was debated all the way to Congress. The Gemini 3 mission of 23 March 1965, America's first two-man spaceflight, was shrouded in controversy when astronaut John Young snuck a corned beef sandwich on board. The sandwich is shown here embedded in acrylic and is exhibited at the Grissom Memorial Museum in Mitchell, Indiana . The incident was explained by Robert Pearlman at Collectspace, . On spaceflight missions, the items astronauts are allowed to take with them are extremely restricted. And in the Sixties, at the dawn of the space age, restrictions were more enforced than ever as Nasa wanted to ensure each risky mission passed without a hitch. The Gemini programme was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. The spacecraft, nicknamed Molly Brown, carried astronauts Virgil I. 'Gus' Grissom, command pilot, and John W. Young, pilot, on three orbits of Earth. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. Gemini 3's primary goal was to test the new, manoeuverable Gemini spacecraft. In space, the crew members fired thrusters to change the shape of their orbit, shift their orbital plane slightly, and drop to a lower altitude. This paved the way to the manoeuvres needed for the success of the Apollo missions. So when astronaut John Young pulled out a sandwich from his spacesuit, two hours after launching from Cape Canaveral in Florida, mission controllers were understandably perturbed. ‘Where did that come from?’ co-astronaut Gus Grissom asked Young when he produced the previously hidden item, in a bizarre exchange you can read in Nasa’s transcript of the mission. ‘I brought it with me. Let’s see how it tastes. Smells, doesn’t it?’ Young replied. He had been given the contrabrand from fellow astronaut Wally Schirra, who was known for his pranks within the agency. But the stunt, although amusing, could have had serious consequences. Space food was typically prepared in liquid or cube form to prevent crumbs spilling out and potentially getting stuck in a key piece of equipment. The sandwich though, having not been vetted for launch, quickly began to break apart, which would later earn the astronauts a severe reprimand. ‘It’s breaking up. I’m going to stick it in my pocket,’ said Grissom. ‘Is it? It was a thought, anyway,’ replied Young. ‘Not a very good one,’ said Grissom. The rest of the almost five-hour mission passed without incident and the astronauts were  treated to stunning views as they orbited Earth. ‘That’s beautiful!’ exclaimed Young, looking out a window. But on their return to Earth, the astronauts soon found that not everyone had seen the funny side of their exchange in orbit. Pictured here in their spacesuits are Virgil 'Gus' Grissom (left) and John W. Young, seen with the portable suit air conditioners connected and their helmets on. Young would go on to be one of Nasa's most decorated astronauts, but Grissom died in the Apollo 1 launchpad fire on 27 January 1967 . John Young had been given the contrabrand from fellow astronaut Wally Schirra, who was known for his pranks within the agency, and put it inside his spacesuit on the way to the launchpad, seen here. Young is walking in front with Grissom behind, as they head for the elevator at Launch Pad 19 for their three-orbit flight . The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965, pictured left. The spacecraft was incredibly cramped, seen in a simulator on the right (Young is left, Grissom right), and thus the movements and actions of the astronauts inside were severely restricted . The major fear of having crumbs in a spacecraft was that they could get stuck in various controls, something that featured in the 15th episode of the fifth season of The Simpsons, Deep Space Homer, when Homer opened and spilled a bag of crisps in space (shown) ‘My thought is that... to have one of the astronauts slip a sandwich aboard the vehicle, frankly, is just a little bit disgusting,’ Representative George Shipley of Illinois later said to Nasa administrators in Houston. ‘We have taken steps... to prevent recurrence of corned beef sandwiches in future flights,’ replied George Mueller, associate administrator for manned spaceflight. Despite the incident, the astronauts were not prohibited from flying again. Here's some we made earlier: Shown is the official food taken into space on the Gemini 3 mission, including dehydrated beef pot roast, bacon and egg bites, toasted bread cubes, orange juice and a wet wipe. Water is being inserted into the pouch of dehydrated food in the image . Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. Pictured is the later Gemini 7 in orbit, as seen from Gemini 6 during a rendezvous mission in December 1965 . The USS Intrepid pulls up alongside the Gemini 3 spacecraft during recovery operations following the successful flight on 23 March 1965. Navy swimmers stand on the spacecraft's flotation collar waiting to hook a hoist line to the spacecraft . Indeed, John Young would became one of Nasa’s most decorated astronauts, flying on the subsequent Gemini 10 and Apollo 10 missions, and also setting foot on the moon on Apollo 16. He was also part of the inaugural Space Shuttle mission - STS-1 in 1981 - which amusingly was the first time Nasa allowed corned beef on a flight - before his sixth and final mission, STS-9, in 1983. Sadly, Gus Grissom’s next mission was Apollo 1, designed to be a low-Earth orbit test of the Apollo Command and Service Module. In a routine test on 27 January 1967, the capsule caught fire, killing all three crew members - Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee - inside the module.","The Gemini 3 mission launched from Florida on 23 March 1965 .

"Within hours of a white officer shooting an unarmed black man, the police chief of Wisconsin's capital city was praying with the man's grandmother, hoping to strike a conciliatory tone and avoid the riots that last year rocked Ferguson, Missouri. Chief Mike Koval said he knows Madison is being watched across the nation since 19-year-old Tony Robinson's death on Friday evening, and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called Ferguson's 'missteps.' 'Folks are angry, resentful, mistrustful, disappointed, shocked, chagrined. I get that,' Koval said Saturday. 'People need to tell me squarely how upset they are with the Madison Police Department.' Scroll down for video . Chief Mike Koval said he knows Madison is being watched across the nation since 19-year-old Tony Robinson's death on Friday evening, and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called Ferguson's 'missteps' The contrasts with Ferguson are many. While Ferguson police initially gave little information about the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old, unarmed black man, Koval rushed to the home of Robinson's mother. She didn't want to meet with him, he said, but he talked and prayed with Robinson's grandmother in the driveway for 45 minutes. It took a week for Ferguson to release the name of the officer who shot Brown. Koval announced the name of the officer involved in Madison, Matt Kenny, the day after the shooting. He volunteered to reporters that the officer had been in a previous fatal shooting in 2007, and that he had been cleared of wrongdoing. On the day that Ferguson police named the officer who shot Brown, they also released video showing what they said was Brown robbing a store. Tony Robinson, an unarmed black 19-year-old, was fatally shot Friday, by Matt Kenny, a white police officer, the Madison police chief said Saturday . When Koval was asked about Robinson's past criminal record Saturday, he declined to comment, saying it would be inappropriate to do so a day after the man died. 'We have a police chief who genuinely feels for a family's loss. It should be abundantly clear to anyone following this incident that Madison, Wisconsin, is not Ferguson, Missouri,' said Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, the state's largest police union. But the chief's measured approach hasn't impressed some demonstrators. Koval angered some of them earlier this year with a blog post demanding they stop blaming police for their problems. 'There are no apologies that can repair the loss or deal with the loss of (Robinson),' said Brandi Grayson, an organizer with Young, Gifted and Black, a Madison group that has demonstrated against what it says is mistreatment of blacks by the justice system. 'This was bound to happen. There's nothing the chief can say short of changing the system.' People gather outside the house where Tony Robinson was shot during a rally on Saturday to protest his death . Robinson died on Friday night after Kenny shot him in an apartment during a confrontation. Kenny had responded to a call of a man jumping in and out of traffic. Kenny forced his way into the apartment after hearing what Koval described as a 'disturbance.' The state Justice Department's Division of Criminal Investigation has taken over the investigation under a new state law passed last year that requires an outside agency to lead probes of officer-involved shootings. DOJ spokeswoman Anne Schwartz declined to comment on Sunday. The shooting comes against a backdrop of multiple instances of white police officers killing unarmed black men around the country over the last year. The highest-profile incident was the death of Brown in Ferguson last August. Days of violence ensued, marked by looting, fires, police firing tear gas into a crowd and officers pointing weapons at demonstrators. Another round of riots broke out in November after a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson. While Robinson's mom didn't want to meet with him, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval talked and prayed with the dead man's grandmother for 45 minutes . Relatives and friends of Tony Robinson exit a gathering of church representatives, community leaders and residents at Fountain of Life Covenant Church, Saturday, in Madison, Wis. Last week the U.S. Justice Department declined to charge Wilson with civil rights violations but issued a scathing report accusing the Ferguson police department of racism and using policing to fund the city's budget. Koval, who is white, took over as Madison's chief in April, replacing retiring black Chief Noble Wray. In September he told the Wisconsin State Journal he believed his department could deal with a racially charged shooting better than Ferguson, saying his agency is more diverse and more invested in the community than Ferguson's 'rent-a-cops.' 'I see in Ferguson a series of missteps and miscues where they're always reacting and, in fact, over-reacting to every set of facts that is thrown in their midst, frankly,' Koval said in the interview. Two months ago, Koval wrote a blog post criticizing Young, Black and Gifted for blaming his officers for 'everything from male pattern baldness to global warming.' The entry came in response to the group staging protests over officer-involved deaths during rush-hour traffic, demanding jail officials release 350 black inmates and imploring police to stay out of black neighborhoods. Koval tried to be diplomatic when asked about the post on Saturday, saying he and the group have agreed to disagree on policing black neighborhoods. Grayson said Koval has had plenty of time to prepare for a racially charged shooting after watching what unfolded in Ferguson. 'He had a perfect response — perfect for white people,' she said.

"A father has been left unable to recognise the faces of his wife or two children after suffering a stroke. After the devastating episode Bob Cockshott, from Orpington, south east London, even looked at a picture of a couple holding a baby and didn't recognise it was him, his wife and their daughter. The 58-year-old discovered he had suffered a minor stroke after he woke in the night thinking that he had gone blind. Bob Cockshott, from Orpington, south east London, has been left unable to recognise the faces of his wife or two children after suffering a stroke . Mr Cockshott was diagnosed with a severe case of prosopagnosia - otherwise known as face blindness - which is a surprisingly common condition, but usually inherited . Doctors said the attack had been triggered by a blood clot on the brain and he was discharged once the swelling on his brain had gone down. He had thought that a slight loss of vision in part of his eye was the only lasting legacy of his stroke. But he soon realised his problem was far more serious when he went to school to pick up his six-year-old son Alex and couldn't pick him out among the rest of the children. And when he looked through family photo albums he found he couldn't recognise his own children when they were younger - or even a picture of himself. When he looked through photo albums of family holidays (pictured) he found he couldn't recognise his own children when they were younger - or even a picture of himself . Mr Cockshott said now his children are grown up he can't really remember what they looked like when they were younger . He also had difficulty identifying Clare his wife of 22 years if her hair was tied back in other photos. Mr Cockshott was diagnosed with a severe case of prosopagnosia - otherwise known as face blindness - which is a surprisingly common condition, but usually inherited. Since then he has struggled to recognise friends and workmates but copes by memorising people's distinctive features, such as posture, mannerisms and speech. He has decided to speak out about it now to raise awareness of the condition. Mr Cockshott, a director at the Knowledge Transfer Network - an initiative funded by the UK's national innovation agency - said: 'When I used to pick my son up from school all the kids were in their uniform so I was unable to recognise him. Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases. Mr Cockshott, who married Clare in 1993, is father to Alex, 13, and daughter Anne, 17, and says they have all come to terms with his bizarre condition since his stroke in 2008 . Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people's faces. Also known as 'face-blindness', the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers. Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, and in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object. Some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces. The condition is not related to memory loss, impaired vision or learning disabilities. It is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory. Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases the condition is congenital, and present at birth. It appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion. Some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome. Treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies, including relying on voice recognition, clothing, or unique physical attributes. Source: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke . 'There was a similar occasion at Charing Cross station with my daughter - she didn't tell me what she was wearing so I hadn't a clue who she was. 'I thought I only had a mild version of the condition but after I did some tests the doctors told me I had a severe impairment. 'It is very difficult to imagine really. People find it impossible to believe that I can't recognise their face. 'It is difficult for people I know to comprehend that my brain can't work out what they look like.' He added: 'It is only the faces that I can't recognise, so I can identify people by their hair or clothing or their mannerisms and posture. 'If there are people who look similar in the same place then I would really struggle. I wait for people to approach me. 'When I am in the supermarket my wife will whisper in my ear and say ""That's John our neighbour"" or something like that. 'If a picture of my wife was in front of me and her hair was tied back I wouldn't be able to say who it was. 'There was one time when I was looking at a couple holding a baby and I recognised the baby's outfit but I didn't realise it was me and my wife holding it.

Hazel Plastow, a director at Face Blind UK which Bob is a member of, said: 'You can't cure face blindness but there are lots of strategies to help cope with it if we can raise some awareness.

"Beauty giant Sephora has been slammed by its customers in the US for marketing a lipstick which is named 'Underage Red'. The offensively-labeled item, which is part of a range of beauty products created by tattoo artist-turned-reality star Kat Von D, real name Katherine von Drachenberg, 33, has caused outrage among customers, many of whom have taken to social media to vent their anger at the store. 'Went shopping for some makeup. How on earth is this a lipstick color?' one person questioned on Twitter, after posting a picture of the lipstick name. Scroll down for video . Offensive: A group of concerned Sephora customers took to Twitter to slam the beauty giant for marketing a lipstick from the Kat Von D range which is named 'Underage Red' (pictured) Beauty guru: Ms Von D, 33, whose real name is Katherine von Drachenberg (pictured), first rose to fame while starring in TLC reality series LA Ink . Cult favorite: According to the Sephora website (pictured), Underage Red, a 'matte fire engine red' lipstick, is particularly popular with customers . 'JESUS do they have a whole sex offender line?' someone else tweeted. 'Lipstick named by creeps,' another person added. Some people, however, chose to see the 'funny side' of the bizarrely-named lipstick, which is believed to have launched around a year ago in stores, and others went as far as to defend Ms Von D's decision to opt for such a risky name. 'So dumb that people are upset over a lipstick color,' one girl tweeted. '""Underage Red"" is a hilarious title, especially coming from Kat Von D. Its funny, guys.' The lipstick, which is currently available on the Sephora website and in select stores, is described as being a 'matte fire engine red' and is also highlighted by Sephora as being a 'cult favorite' with its customers. Two types of 'Underage Red' lipsticks are also available at Sephora's first Australian store in Sydney . Going global: 'Underage Red' lipsticks also sold in the Sydney store include the Everlasting Liquid Finish Lipstick for AUD $30 ($20) (pictured) and the Studded Kiss Lipstick for AUD $31 ($21) New venture: Sephora's Sydney store, at Westfield's Pitt Street Mall, opened on December 5 last year .

Other names included in the Studded Kiss Lipstick line-up include Lolita, Hellbent, and Sexer. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Sydney Sephora for comment. Interestingly, it is not the first time that the name choices for these lipsticks have been questioned by Sephora's customers. In November 2013, the cosmetics company was forced to issue an apology to its customers and pull a Kat Von D lipstick with the shade description 'Celebutard' from its stores and website after receiving numerous complaints about the 'insensitivity' of the lipstick's name. Outrage: Many people have tweeted their horror at the controversial lipstick name . Under fire: It is not yet known how Sephora will respond to the controversy surrounding the lipstick name . 'It has come to our attention that the name of one shade of a lipstick we carry has caused offense to some of our clients and others,' a Sephora spokesperson said in a statement at the time. 'We are deeply sorry for that, and we have ceased sale of that shade both in our stores and online.' According to People.com, Ms Von D refused to apologize for the controversial lipstick moniker and even took to Twitter to defend the name, saying: 'At the end of the day, it's just a f*****g lipstick.'

"Suburbs with higher percentages of younger residents will experience a bigger growth in value from having railway constructions, a new study has found. Onthehouse Research found the suburbs where the median age of residents was below the national average of 37 years showed a stronger relationship between train stations and price growth. The study picked seven suburbs to keep an eye on based on impending railway constructions that will likely transform their value, reports Property Observer. A new study has found Suburbs with higher percentages of younger residents will experience a bigger growth in value from having railway constructions . The study picked seven suburbs to keep an eye on based on impending railway constructions that will likely transform their value . The new stations will allow younger residents to access Sydney CBD, therein generating thousands of jobs. The seven suburbs to watch out for are Kellyville, Rouse Hill, Bella Vista, Baulkam Hills, Paddington, Randwick and Kingsford. 'In Kellyville, the building and maintenance of the station, increased dwelling construction and new commercial establishments are expected to create over 3,000 jobs in the area, said Eliza Owen, Onthehouse market analyst. 'Whereas in Kingsford, where one third of the residents fall between 20-29 years old, the light rail is expected to be popular with young people and students travelling to the city for entertainment and work outside of study hours.'

"Mert Tanay has been banned from driving for three years after he was caught speeding at 124mph on the M20 with his six-year-old son as passenger . A reckless father sped along a crowded motorway at 142mph as his six-year-old son sat terrified in the passenger seat. Mert Tanay weaved in and out of traffic in his powerful BMW 323 and even failed to realise he had sped past a police car that had been chasing another speeding vehicle on the M20 at Harrietsham, Kent. Police chased the 26-year-old for 10 miles to catch him and when he pulled over officers said his son looked terrified and was shaking in the passenger seat. Tanay had told police he was driving at such speed because he was 'distracted' thinking about his forthcoming wedding in six months time. The incident took place on September 28, Canterbury Crown Court heard. Tanay has been banned from driving for three years. He was eventually stopped by police after being seen speeding on the coastbound carriageway near Harrietsham. Alex Rooke, prosecuting, said: 'He was driving so fast as to be considered dangerous, well in excess of 100 miles per hour. 'According to the officer his speed was excessive on what was a crowded motorway. 'He showed little regard for the welfare of his passenger and other road users for a prolonged spell of driving.' At one point Tanay was clocked at 141.6 mph as he tore along the coastbound carriageway last September. Scroll down for video . He admitted dangerous driving and was banned for three years and ordered to carry out 50 hours unpaid work. Tanay, of Enfield, Middlesex, was also ordered to take an extended driving test to retain his licence by Judge Nigel van der Bijl . Defending Paul Hogben said: 'Thankfully there was no accident, injuries or damage but he is a man with a full-time job and is due to be married at the end of this month.' Police speed cameras captured Tanay speeding at 140mph as he tore past them in his powerful BMW . Kent Police have released a video of the chase as a warning to other motorists. Sergeant Chris Wade said: 'The speed and manner of Mert Tanay's driving in this case showed a complete disregard for the safety of other road users, not to mention that of his young passenger who looked very shaken by his experience. 'Tanay's actions on what is a busy motorway fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver. 'Educating drivers in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on Kent's roads is a vitally important part of our role.'","Mert Tanay was driving along M20 with his six-year-old son as passenger .

"Reeva Steenkamp's mother says she does not care if an upcoming appeal leads to a harsher sentence for Oscar Pistorius, the South African athlete who killed her. He was convicted of 'negligent killing' in September 2014 which carries a maximum five-year prison sentence - but prosecutors believe he should be charged with the more serious crime of murder. The Olympian's lawyers will this week challenge the judge's decision to allow prosecutors to appeal his conviction for killing Reeva at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day in 2013. His deceased girlfriend's mother June is not seeking revenge against the disabled athlete but says she knew nothing 'about Oscar's guns and his way of life' and criticised her daughter's portrayal during the case. Heartbroken: Reeva Steenkamp's mother June (pictured) says she does not care if an appeal leads to her daughter's killer Oscar Pistorius being convicted of murder . Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius (right) killed his then-girlfriend Reeva (left) on Valentine's Day 2013, but was eventually convicted of her 'negligent killing' Moving on: June Steenkamp (pictured at Pistorius' trial) does not want revenge on her daughter's killer but says she knew nothing about his 'guns and way of life' She said: 'She was, in the trial, referred to as ""the deceased"". She became invisible. People forgot that someone died here. My daughter died. Horribly.' 'I don't want him to suffer in any way, because he's a disabled person.' Mrs Steenkamp has now written a book about her daughter called 'Reeva: A Mother's Story' and the upcoming launch of the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation to battle domestic violence. Although she finds it 'very strange that they were fighting in a three month relationship', she refused to say if Reeva was herself a victim of domestic violence. And regarding the appeal to have Pistorius convicted of murder, she said: 'How is it going to help me?' Oscar Pistorius was reported to be furious after learning that prosecutors had been granted permission to take the case to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal. Oscar Pistorius flew into a rage after learning that prosecutors had been given permission to appeal his murder acquittal - opening the door for a stiffer 15-year prison sentence. In 2014, prosecutors won their bid to challenge his manslaughter verdict handed to the Paralympic gold medalist - opening the door for a possible 15-year prison sentence. Change: June hopes her new book 'Reeva: A Mother's Story' and a new foundation she's setting up in the deceased model's name will help combat domestic violence in South Africa . Angry: Pistorius - who won six Paralympic gold medals throughout his career - was reportedly furious when he found out prosecutors would be allowed to challenge his conviction for 'negligent killing' A source said: 'He got up and stomped. He went straight to the gym. He started lifting weights like it was going out of fashion. He is p***** off.' Legal experts said it was unlikely that Pistorius would now be released on house arrest after serving just ten months of his sentence as he had previously hoped. His former girlfriend's mother has now urged women to speak out about their own abuse - telling the audience at the University of Johannesburg: 'Teach your daughters to have the confidence to come forward. Her foundation will do the work her daughter would have done if she had still been alive, said Mrs Steenkamp. She revealed that her daughter had been 'preoccupied' with the unacceptable numbers of rape and murders reported in her native South Africa. It was reported earlier this month that Oscar Pistorius is so paranoid about being poisoned in prison that he is reportedly surviving on tinned food from the tuck shop. The Paralympic star, who was jailed four months ago for killing his girlfriend has lost so much weight that his prosthetic limbs no longer fit him, according to South Africa's You Magazine.","Prosecutors were allowed to appeal Pistorius' verdict for 'negligent killing'

"Examining an ultrasound scan of your unborn child is a nerve-racking moment for most parents. But any worries that Ed and Dee Parsons may have harboured quickly faded when they saw their baby in the womb at 20 weeks. The child was making an unmistakable V-sign – the victory gesture associated with Winston Churchill and, latterly, with world peace. The baby formed a V symbol with its tiny fingers while in mother Dee Parson's womb during a scan . ‘The sonographer couldn't believe it – she said she had never seen anything like it before,’ said Mrs Parsons, 35. ‘It’s nice to have such an iconic image of peace when there’s so much unrest all around us. It was very reassuring. She said she and her husband, also 35, were feeling weighed down by negative global events and the death of someone close to them. ‘We were thinking, we’re bringing this child into the world at such a horrible time,’ she added. ‘But then this happened, we couldn’t quite believe what we were seeing. 'All our friends said they thought it was such a positive, happy symbol.’ The couple, who live in Godalming, Surrey, and run an event production business, are thinking of calling the baby Winston if it is a boy. ‘It’s growing on us,’ Mrs Parsons said. ‘But for now we are calling it peace-baby, that’s our nickname.’ Mrs Parsons, who has a daughter, Grace, six, from a previous marriage, said that in the 12-week scan the child had given a clear thumbs-up.

"Adam Stinnett had to have his military-style haircut (above) shaved off after the Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary School in Tennessee said it was 'distracting' A school has forced a seven-year-old boy  to shave off his military-style haircut - despite being told it was inspired by his soldier stepbrother. Amy Stinnett received a letter from  the Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary School, in McMinnville, Tennessee, the day after her son Adam visited the barbers. It said his haircut was distracting and would have to be shaved off. When Ms Stinnett refused to comply the principal told her that Adam would not be able to return to school, Fox News reported. An email to Ms Stinnett said: 'I have the utmost respect for the military and its members. 'However we are not a military school and the boy's haircut is against our rules.' Adam's stepbrother  served in Afghanistan and is still an active soldier. He inspired Adam to join the military and is the reason he got the haircut, Ms Stinnett said. The letter was even more surprising as the school is named after a Navy Corpsman  killed in the Vietnam War. David Robert 'Bobby' Ray was awarded a Medal of Honor posthumously after using his body to shield a Marine from a grenade in 1969. Ms Stinnett said she wants an apology and described the situation as 'crazy' and 'bizarre'. She said: 'They shamed my son and they shamed a lot of military people - that's how I feel about it.'

"Eleanor de Freitas, 23, died on April 4 last year - three days before she was due to stand trial accused of perverting the course of justice . The family of a young woman who killed herself days before going on trial for 'inventing a rape claim' are calling for lessons to be learned. Eleanor de Freitas, 23, from Fulham, west London, received a private prosecution summons for perverting the course of justice, funded by a man accused of drugging and raping her. But the former Durham University student died on April 4 last year - three days before the trial was due to start at Southwark Crown Court in London. Her family said they were 'astonished' the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to take bipolar sufferer Miss de Freitas to court. She made a rape allegation to Metropolitan Police in January 2013 against wealthy financier, Alexander Economou, 35, claiming the incident had happened just before Christmas 2012. It was investigated but officers closed the case after concluding that gaps in the evidence meant they would not be able to secure a conviction. Despite being told he would not face charges, Mr Economou paid for his own inquiry, assembling emails, text messages, details of phone calls and CCTV footage of them together. He then started a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. The whole process is said to have cost him £200,000. The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case but decided against using its powers to throw it out, leaving her frightened and devastated. The inquest into her death was originally opened in November last year, but was adjourned so the Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders could personally investigate the CPS's decision to prosecute. West London coroner Chinyere Inyama also said he needed to know the remit of the CPS investigation before deciding on the scope of his hearing. Ahead of the resumption tomorrow, her father David de Freitas said: 'The most important thing for us is that lessons are learnt from the tragic death of our daughter. 'We hope that the inquest will explore the important public interest issues regarding prosecutions of rape complainants and the appropriate protections and care that should be put in place for vulnerable people like Eleanor. Her father David de Freitas (left) said that lessons need to be learnt from her 'tragic death'. She had accused Alexander Economou (right) of raping her but the allegations were dropped due to lack of evidence . 'In view of the importance of this case and its tragic consequences, we need to make sure that existing guidelines and practices were adhered to and that any shortcomings in these guidelines and practices are identified and remedied so that no other vulnerable young women and their families have to suffer as we and Eleanor did.' Lawyers for the family said they are hoping the inquest will explore the impact the case had on Miss de Freitas taking her own life and the wider public interest of prosecuting rape complainants for perverting the course of justice. Harriet Wistrich, solicitor for the family, said: 'This inquest offers an important opportunity to ensure that lessons are learnt from this needless death and so as to ensure that similar tragic outcomes are avoided in the future.' Mr Economou paid for his own inquiry, assembling emails, text messages, details of phone calls and CCTV footage of him and Miss de Freitas (pictured) together . The former Durham University student had bipolar disorder. The inquest into her death will resume tomorrow . Deborah Coles, co-director of support charity Inquest, said: 'This case raises important issues of public importance regarding the treatment of rape complainants. In addition to the specific vulnerabilities of this particular group, Eleanor suffered from a diagnosed serious mental illness. 'There must now be a robust and thorough inquest in order to appropriately consider whether Eleanor received adequate support under the care of West London Mental Health Care Trust and to what extent the prosecution of Eleanor impacted on her life.' The hearing is expected to be completed tomorrow. Eleanor de Freitas claimed she was raped by Alexander Economou just before Christmas 2012. But she did not go to the police station to make a formal complaint until January 4 last year. Detectives investigated but ruled that there were too many inconsistencies in the evidence to bring a successful prosecution. Officers informed Miss de Freitas on February 21 last year that they would not be bringing any charges. But wanting to clear his name, Mr Economou used his own money to launch a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. She received a court summons on August 13 last year. The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case, giving it the power either to end it or to pursue it. To the horror of Miss de Freitas and her family, it decided to continue. Miss de Freitas killed herself on April 7, three days before she was due to stand trial.","Eleanor de Freitas was due to stand trial for perverting course of justice .

"Adventurer Ben Fogle and his wife Marina have said that regular 'MOT' therapy sessions with a marriage counsellor have helped them to cope with the pressures of childcare and strengthen their relationship. The pair, who married in 2006 and have two children, have urged other couples to invest time in their marriage as a preemptive measure 'before it's too late'. Marina, who is founder of antenatal courses The Bump Class, told The Telegraph, 'The most compatible couples will struggle when into the mix you throw an exhausted, emotionally volatile woman who is physically vulnerable after giving birth, and a new father, equally tired and overwhelmed by his new responsibility. Seeking guidance: Ben and Marina, who married in 2006, have two children, Ludo and Iona (pictured). They have urged other couples to invest time in their marriage as a preemptive measure, 'before it's too late' 'Wrapped up in just getting through each day, the parents have little time left for each other, and the communication breakdown begins.' Marina has been keen to stress the importance of communication in a successful marriage, and has said she can  see how couples can easily get so busy that they leave no time for each other. Whilst many of her toddler-raising friends agree that marriage counselling is a good idea, Marina suggested that most couples who receive therapy make the decision too late. Long periods apart: Marina has suggested that many couples become increasingly busy during parenthood, and leave little time for each other . Often, Marina says, this is due to a lack of time. She added: 'We spend a day deliberating about which sofa to buy, but we can’t relinquish an hour for the sake of our marriages?' And the Fogles' marriage has faced more challenges than most in recent years. Last August the pair were left devastated after Marina almost died giving birth to their stillborn son. The toughest of times: Last August the couple were left devastated after Marina almost died giving birth to a stillborn son. In 2012, Ben also lost his beloved Labrador Inca, who he called his 'best friend' 'It was a horribly sad time,' said Ben. Ben has also written about the tragedy of losing his beloved Labrador Inca in 2012, the dog had been a regular companion in his life and was even a catalyst for meeting his wife. It was on his daily dog walk in Hyde Park that Ben bumped into Marina. and the 41-year-old adventurer struggled hugely after losing his 'best friend'. The couple have also had to cope with Ben's regular trips around the world, which force them to spend long periods of time apart. He has admitted to his guilt at leaving Marina behind to look after two children and a dog. It was the trauma of losing their third child that drew the Fogles to see a counsellor. Marina now compares therapy sessions to being as essential as seeing a dentist or optician (stock image) But it was the trauma of losing their third child last year that compelled the Fogles to see a counsellor. Although the initial therapy was focused around dealing with their grief, the pair now see their counsellor regularly about their relationship. They rarely argue, Marina says, but when they do, they can be particularly hard to get over. The house is the thing they say they're most likely to row about - and a confrontation can often take them weeks to recover from. She now compares therapy sessions to being as essential as seeing a dentist or an optician. Moving forward: Marina is using her experiences of motherhood in her own pregnancy clinic in South Kensington advising other mums-to-be . 'I’d argue our emotional wellbeing is significantly more important than our cars, eyes or teeth,' says Marina. 'If you can learn how to be strong while the going is easy, you will be better equipped for the more challenging terrain when it comes.' It was the difficult experience of childbirth that also prompted Marina to open her pregnancy clinic The Bump Class. The mother-of-two now runs her South Kensington-based clinic along with her sister, Chiara Hunt, and the pair aim to guide pregnant women through what can be a daunting time. The idea is that women often have very similar experiences during childbirth and they can benefit from sharing their journey with others.","Ben Fogle and his wife Marina admit their marriage needed 'maintenance'

"An African-American chef who is out of a job after the University of Oklahoma shut down a fraternity for performing a racist chant has said he will never find such a good job again. Howard Dixon, who has served students his famous chili dogs and burgers at Sigma Alpha Epsilon for 15 years, is now unemployed after the university closed the fraternity with immediate effect. It comes after members were filmed chanting 'There will never be a n***** in SAE' to the tune of 'If You're Happy And You Know It'. 'I think that was kind of stupid and selfish for them to do something like that,' Howard told CBS. 'And knowing this was an organization supposed to be about brotherhood - that wasn't no brotherhood.' Scroll down for video . Out of a job: Howard Dixon, the chef for Oklahoma University's disgraced fraternity, has said he will miss the job and his 'family'. He is pictured moving out of the fraternity house on Tuesday . Moving out: He was seen removing items and loading up his car outside the frat house in Norman on Tuesday . Packing up: Dixon carries his cooking belongings from the frat house (right) as police officers stand nearby . But Howard added that he will miss his job and the fraternity's members. 'There'll never be another job like this one again,' he said. 'This was one of a kind. I'll miss my family.' On Tuesday, photos emerged showing Mr Dixon moving his belongings out of the house. After it emerged that the beloved chef would be losing his job, Oklahoma University alumni launched online fundraisers, which have already raised more than $45,000 for the man and his family. One former SAE member created an Indiegogo fundraiser, writing: 'He is going to lose his job because of a bus full of racist kids... Because of these kids' actions, many will be affected. None more so than Howard.' Howard, he writes, 'was always there to chat with you' but now 'he is going to learn who has been working for. And through some cruel twist of fate, he has to lose the job that he has held for over a decade.' Support: Howard has worked as a chef at Oklahoma University's Sigma Alpha Epsilon for more than 15 years and alumni remembered his famous chili dogs and how he had an 'infectious' smile . 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was performed by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma on Saturday. The society has since been shut down . By early on Tuesday, the fund had amassed more than $33,000 - and it is not the only one. Simultaneously another former SAE brother set up a GoFundMe page slamming 'the disgusting chant' and lauding Howard as 'hard-working and loyal'. That page has raised more than $11,000. A Twitter user who shared a link to the fundraising page wrote: 'I went to an OU SAE tailgate one time, (had a great time) an i met that man howard, he grills a mean burger.' All members of the fraternity had until midnight on Monday to leave the premises, University of Oklahoma President David Boren announced at a press conference amid a chorus of furious reaction to the footage. On Tuesday, Boren expelled two students after he said they were identified as leaders of the chant.

"Stone Age farmers in Italy cut the flesh from the bones of their dead before burying them, a new study has found. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered cut marks on 7,000 year old human remains buried in a cave in Puglia, south eastern Italy. These cuts and scrapes, made with stone tools, suggest the skeletons had their flesh carefully removed in rituals before being placed in the cave. Many bones, such as this fibula, found in the Scaloria Cave showed fine cut marks made with stone tools . Archaeologists leading the research believe cleaning of the dead was probably the culmination of a protracted multi-stage burial process. Dr John Robb, a reader in European prehistory at the University of Cambridge, and his team say it might have been a way of returning the bones to their stone like origins. In 3,800BC a young couple were buried together in a final embrace that was hoped to keep them together for all eternity. Now the remains of the man and woman - who are said to have died in their twenties - have been uncovered in the Diros Caves in the Peloponnese region of Greece. An archaeologist leading the excavation of the ‘underworld’ cavern described the find as ‘stunning’ and said it is possibly the oldest grave ever found in the country. The remains were initially unearthed in 2013 and have now been analysed using radiocarbon dating. The results of the analysis showed the bones belonged to a man and a woman, both aged between 20 and 25, dating back almost 5,800 years. The cavern is known as Alepotrypa - or 'foxhole' - and was found in the 1950s. Experts believe hundreds of people lived inside Alepotrypa before the entrance collapsed burying everyone alive. They say that many of the stalactites in the cave resemble bones themselves and the floor of the cave is littered with long, thin broken stalactites. Farmers from villages up to 12 miles away are thought to have brought their dead to the Scaloria Cave in the Tavoliere region of Italy. Writing in the journal Antiquity, Dr Robb and his colleagues said: 'Neolithic people at Scaloria Cave engaged in a varied range of funerary practices including primary burial, skull removal and redeposition, and defleshing and secondary deposition. 'If we suppose that stalactites were understood as equivalent to bones on a stone-like plane of existence, then cleaning bones and returning them to the stalactite-filled cave may have been understood as returning the bones to an eternal place where they came into being, the conclusion of a cycle of temporal incarnation. 'Conversely, the water that formed 'stone bones' in the cave (stalactites) and hence bones in the living may have been understood as spiritually powerful or nourishing.' Scaloria Cave stretches deep underground and is composed of at least two main chambers. It was completely sealed off until its discovery in 1931, when human remains, stone tools and broken pottery were discovered inside. The lowest section of the cave is only accessible though a narrow and steep passage that can only be crawled through. There Neolithic people placed pottery vessels where dripping water from the stalactites collected. Scaloria cave is a deep multi-caverned grotto in Tavoliere region of Puglie, in southeastern Italy, shown above . The delicate stalactites in the cave (left ) resemble bones as can be seen in the image on the right where a collection of bones recovered from the cave and stalactite fragments found among them on the cave floor . Archaeologists found more than 40 pots encrusted into the stalactites themselves. The upper chamber is more than 260 feet (80 metres) long and around 6 feet (2 metres) high. This area was occasionally inhabited and used to keep livestock but was also were farmers from the surrounding area placed their dead. In 1978 the fragmented remains of between 22 and 31 individuals were discovered in the chamber, around half of which were children. In one case one child aged between five and seven years old that dated to 5463-5221 BC had been buried complete but the skull had been later removed. An isolated adult skull was also found in a small stone niche in the cave. Dr Robb and his colleagues, which include Dr Ernestine Elster at University of California Los Angeles and researchers from the University of Rome and the Italian Institute of Experimental Archaeology, examined the bones, which have been lent to the University of Cambridge by the Archaeological National Museum in Manfredonia. The bones were found among pieces of broken pottery in the Scaloria cave during excavations in 1971 . They found no evidence of gnawing or damage caused by animals and few of the bones had been broken. However they did find that the bones were covered in small, barely visible cut marks made using flint or other stone tools. They found no heavy chop marks and instead it appears they had been cut using controlled, fine incisions. They said they found cut marks through out the skeletons they found, particularly around major joints or tendon attachments. Dr Robb and his colleagues conclude that the cutting technique was not aimed at removing major muscles in butchery. They wrote: 'Instead it seems to have been aimed at removing residual ... muscle tissue by working down the shaft and pulling or cleaning with the hands until some particularly tenacious bit required a few slices to free it. 'We have called this technique 'nick and strip'.' They added that the absence of violence and butchery suggests the flesh was not removed for cannibalism. Instead they believe the remains were brought from the farming settlements surrounding Scaloria where any remaining flesh was removed, the skeletons were dis-articulated and then strewn on the cave floor. They say some of the remains may have been previously buried before being brought to the cave. The ritual could have been similar to the Huron Feast of the Dead in North America, where the buried remains of dead relatives were dug up, cleaned and then reburied when the village moved location. Dr Robb and his colleagues said it appeared there may be a link between the pottery placed in the lower cave the ritual burials in the upper chamber. They said disposing of bones in this way may have marked an end to the mourning. Speaking to Mail Online, Dr Robb said: 'They had a remarkable variety of burial practices, which often created prolonged interactions with the dead. 'In this case, the paradoxical thing is that they seem to have cleaned the bones and then immediately disposed of them. 'It seems likely that producing clean bone was the end point of a longer ritual of mourning. 'Here at Scaloria people deposited both bones from elsewhere and whole bodies, and they seem to have cleaned the bones within less than a year after death, when some soft tissues were still on them. 'But it probably was an occasion for the community to come together and remember the dead.'","Bones of up to 31 Neolithic farmers found in Scaloria Cave, in Puglia Italy .

"A U.S. senator has revealed he has never sent an email despite completing 12 years in office. South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham insisted that he would happily let anyone look at his emails because he had never needed to send one. The comments were made on Meet the Press during a discussion about the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private server and personal email account to conduct foreign policy. South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham insisted that he would happily let anyone look at his emails because he had never needed to send one . But Graham, who was a congressman for eight years before becoming a senator, insisted that he had nothing to hide. 'I don't email. No, you can have every email I've ever sent. I've never sent one,' he revealed on Sunday's Meet the Press. 'I don't know what that makes me.' The 59-year-old told Chuck Todd that it was crucial to get an independent body to retrieve and vet Clinton's emails properly. Senior figures in Congress are already intensifying their scrutiny of the former secretary of state's communications from 2009-13, which they say were not conducted via official State Department accounts. Clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of communications from the time - but it has been claimed that the documents have 'huge gaps'. One image, which Clinton has used as her Twitter profile picture for the last year, has also been studied  to suggest that vital communications are being deliberately held from public view. It shows a stony-faced Clinton using her mobile while heading to Tripoli on a C-military plane in September 2011. Rep. Trey Gowdy told CBS News he had been provided with no emails from the 2011 trip - despite Clinton being pictured allegedly communicating while aboard the plane. He said: 'There are gaps of months and months and months. The comments were made during a discussion about the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private server and personal email account to conduct foreign policy. This image of Clinton, taking during a 2011 trip, is also being scrutinized . 'And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip. 'So, it's strange credibility to believe that if you're on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there's not a single document that has been turned over to Congress.' President Obama has also revealed he heard that Clinton used a private email account to conduct official state business at 'the same time as everybody else' when news reports surfaced.","South Carolina Republican insists he doesn't have any emails to look at .

"For most people who turn 80, it is the time to kick back, relax and enjoy a well-earned retirement. But for one karate-kicking great-grandmother in Kansas, there is no letting up. Helen Dugan, a third-degree black belt, continues to lead karate classes at the school she set up, Champs Achievers, despite passing the milestone. Battling on: Despite turning 80, Helen Dugan, owner of karate school Champs Achievers, is not letting up . Aiming high: After earning her black belt at 61, Dugan was inspired to teach others the sport in Kansas . Iron fist: Dugan set up the class for disabled children and said it was important to 'build on their strengths' The great-grandmother of 17 only took up the sport when she took two of her children to a class at the age of 47, the Kansas City Star reports. She said: 'We never had karate when I was a child, so I took my sons to a class and I realised that my two skinny sons didn't need the exercise and so I got into the back row of the class.' Her children lasted four years before as she puts it, 'they discovered girls and got married', but she 'was hooked'. Dugan, who has been married to husband Barney for 57 years, took karate classes for 14 years, earning her black belt at the age of 61. At the time she was also working as a nurse in the Center School District in Kansas City, in Missouri. Leading the way: Dugan takes a hit from seven-year-old Brayden Bond during a class in Lenexa, Kansas . Listen in: The great-grandmother quiets the class as three-year-old Aiden Degnan tries to get her attention . Friendly face: Dugan has seen her class grow in the last 20 years and it now caters for more than 50 children . Jousting: Dugan takes on five-year-old Micah Jenkins using pugil sticks during one of her sessions . Inspired to pass on her expertise to others, the mother-of-five set up a non-profit karate class called Champs aimed at helping those with a disability. Karate and other martial arts taught at the group -  including judo, jujitsu, tai chi and a defensive street-fighting discipline called Guided Chaos - can improve concentration, stamina, balance, motor skills, independence and self-esteem. She said: 'I started the group because the class I was learning in had children who couldn't keep up, so I took them aside. Sometimes it was because of learning disabilities, or it was children with ADHD. 'I then started teaching them separately.' Now almost 20 years later, the group is going from strength to strength and caters for more than 50 children in the area.","Helen Dugan continues to lead karate classes despite passing age of 80 .

"Media mogul Harvey Weinstein said that he was 'very lucky' to have never experienced anti-Semitism growing up - after making a rousing speech urging the Jewish community to 'get as organised as the mafia' to tackle the problem. The Jewish studio executive, who co-founded film company Miramax before setting up The Weinstein Company, said he had been taught about the issue by his father who had served as a sergeant during World War II. He made the admission after he gave a passionate speech at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's National Tribute Dinner, where he urged listeners to stand up to anti-Semites and 'kick these guys in the ass'. Harvey Weinstein (right) was introduced by actor Christoph Waltz as he received the Humanitarian Award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center at the glitzy ceremony in Beverly Hills. In his acceptance speech he urged the Jewish community to get 'as organised as the mafia' to tackle anti-Semitism - although said afterwards he had never personally experienced it . When asked by the New York Post whether he had experienced anti-Semitism he said: 'Personally, no', adding: 'I’m very lucky that way. 'My dad did, both in the Army and afterwards, so I can only identify and I feel strongly through him. I’ve had a charmed life that way, but I’m still outraged by what’s going on. 'And we need to know and let the people who are doing those things know they can’t get away with it.' 'Charmed life': Harvey Weinstein pictured next to British actress Keira Knighley at the 18th Annual Hollywood Film Awards in November. His film company produced director Quentin Tarantino's wartime movie Inglourious Basterds, set during the Second World War and The Reader . Jewish: Weinstein said his father, who served during the World War Two, taught their family about the problems faced by Jewish communities around the world . His father Max Weinstein had helped the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary organisation based in the Middle East which later became the Israeli Defence Force, during the war. Weinstein, 63, has produced films including The King's Speech, Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds set during the Second World War, and last week accepted the Humanitarian Award at the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Studies by the institute have shown that the number of attacks on Jewish communities around the world is at its highest since 1945. The New Yorker used his acceptance speech to tell the audience: 'I think it's time that we, as Jews, get together with the Muslims who are honorable and peaceful — but we [also] have to go and protect ourselves', The Hollywood Reporter wrote. 'Unfortunately, we [Jews] are gonna have to get as organised as the mafia. We just can't take it any more. We just can't take these things. There's gotta be a way to fight back.' 'While we must be understanding of our Arab brothers and our Islamic brothers,' he added, 'we also have to understand that these crazy b******s [Arab and Islamic extremists] are also killing their own — they're killing neighbours, they're killing people from all sorts of different races. 'And, unlike World War II, when we didn't act right away and we paid the price, we better start acting now. Trust me, I'm the last guy who wants to do anything about it, but I realize if we don't, we will perish.'","Weinstein's father, who served during WWII, taught him about the issue .

"A teenager collapses to the floor every time she laughs due to a rare medical condition. Jodie Kelly, 19, from Dublin, suffers muscle paralysis and keels over nearly ten times a day - usually after laughing. This is due to  a neurological condition called cataplexy - which triggers episodes of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions. The loss of muscle control can range from weakness at the knees to total collapse on the floor. Attacks can last between a few seconds and two minutes, with some people experiencing repeated attacks over a 30-minute period. Miss Kelly first suffered an attack while laughing at a joke in the film 'Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince'. Jodie Kelly, 19, collapses every time she laughs due to the rare medical condition cataplexy, which means sudden loss of muscle control . Reactions to other emotions, such as surprise and anger, could even cause her muscles to become paralysed. She is pictured here (right) with her friend Lauren (left) Miss Kelly has also been diagnosed with narcolepsy, a long-term condition which disrupts the normal sleeping and waking cycles. She now has to sleep for up to 15 hours a day . Since then, the teenager has had to ban herself from watching her favourite comedy TV shows, for fears her giggles  will make her fall over. Favourites such as Graham Norton are switched off, in a bid to stop her from flopping to the floor. And reactions to other emotions, such as surprise and anger, could even cause her muscles to go into a state of paralysis. Miss Kelly, a business management student, said: 'I can literally feel my knees going from beneath me as soon as I start to laugh. 'It's such a strange sensation and I can't even put into words how it feels. 'My head begins to flop like a new born baby's and then before I know it I'm on the floor. 'Often strangers stare at me and I know they think I'm drunk. Cataplexy is a symptom of narcolepsy, a long-term condition causing problems with normal patterns of sleeping and waking. Cataplexy is the sudden, temporary muscle weakness or loss of muscular control. Typical symptoms are: . Cataplexy attacks are usually triggered by an emotion, such as excitement, laughter, anger or surprise. Attacks can last from a few seconds to several minutes. Some people with narcolepsy have cataplexy attacks once or twice a year, while others experience them several times a day. In an attempt to avoid attacks, some people may become emotionally withdrawn and socially isolated. Source: NHS Choices . 'I've been on nights out before and collapsed from laughing when I'm having a good time and people will rush over thinking I'm paralytic and need help. 'It's really difficult not to laugh sometimes and I've had to learn to try and control my emotions.' Miss Kelly can have over 10 episodes a day, but over time she has learnt to control her fall. She said: 'I used to worry that one time I'd fall and really hurt myself, but now I can sense when it's going to happen. 'The first time I noticed symptoms was when I'd gone to see Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. 'I can't remember what made me laugh but thankfully I was sitting down. 'I felt a strange sensation in me neck, it became so weak it just flopped forward and I struggled to support it. 'I didn't understand what was happening and I was too scared to tell my parents for a while.' While realising she no longer had control over her laughter, Miss Kelly also became aware of her increasing tiredness. Gradually she began to find herself falling asleep in the most unusual places. She said: 'I knew something wasn't right as I was so young but I had no energy whatsoever some days. 'Instead of getting home and doing my homework like all the other kids, I would just fall straight to sleep on the sofa. 'I kept going to my GP but tests revealed nothing and I was told I was just going through normal teenage stuff. The teenager has had to ban herself from watching her favourite comedy TV shows, for fears her giggles or sadness will make her fall over. She is pictured here with her parents . 'On one visit to New York with my family I had to lie down next to a tree on the pavement as I was too exhausted to move. 'Thankfully one day I came across an article in a magazine about a girl who was suffering from both narcolepsy and cataplexy and I knew instantly that's what I had. 'Luckily my auntie's neighbour is a sleep scientist and she confirmed what I thought, because I was showing all the right symptoms. 'I then went to see a sleep specialist and my diagnosis was established.' At the age of 12, Miss Kelly was struck down with a throat infection which experts think triggered her narcolepsy. This is a long term condition causing changes in sleep patterns, and excessive daytime sleepiness is one of the first signs. Most people who have narcolepsy also suffer cataplexy. Miss Kelly said she has learned to live with both conditions. She said: 'I need to sleep a lot more than most people and rest more. 'What should be a ten minute walk can take me 40 minutes as I'll need to sit down and take breaks. 'Even in my exams recently I had special circumstances where I could lie down on a mat if I needed a break. Miss Kelly, pictured when she was younger with her aunt Trish, said her friends and family have all been 'fantastic' and have helped her cope with her conditions . 'One of the perks is that when I dream they're really vivid and it's amazing. 'But this comes with a price as when I have nightmares, they're horrendous and so life-like. 'I've even woke up from one screaming before, but no sound came out and my whole body was paralysed. 'I lay there for what seemed forever unable to move, until eventually I could finally sit up. 'Sleep paralysis is another side effect and it can be quite scary at times.' Miss Kelly can sleep up to 15 hours a day and needs a daily nap without fail. She said: 'The more tired I am, the worse my cataplexy is so it's important to sleep when I need to. 'Suffering from both has been tough growing up as I can't just be like most other teenagers. 'I try to stay positive but sometimes both conditions can get me down. 'Thankfully I have incredible friends and family who have all been fantastic. 'They've really helped me cope and I feel safer when I'm out with someone who actually understands and can help if I start to collapse or if I need to sleep.'","Jodie Kelly has the condition cataplexy -  a sudden loss of muscle control .

"Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius (pictured at his sentencing in October) have failed in their bid to stop prosecutors appealing against the athlete's negligent killing conviction for shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead two years ago . Oscar Pistorius's lawyers have failed in their attempt to stop prosecutors appealing against the double-amputee athlete's negligent killing conviction. Judge Thokozile Masipa dismissed their application to challenge the appeal by prosecutors, who want Pistorius convicted of the more serious charge of murder for shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, multiple times in a bathroom in his home on Valentine's Day in 2013. 'The order that I grant in this matter is to strike off the application,' the black-robed Judge Masipa said in her ruling today, dismissing the defence's application. In December, Judge Masipa granted prosecutors permission to take the case to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal and challenge her own ruling to acquit Pistorius of murder and find him guilty instead of a lesser charge comparable to manslaughter. Pistorius's lawyers were arguing that the judge should not have allowed that appeal. The Olympian and multiple Paralympic champion is currently serving a five-year prison sentence for culpable homicide, or negligent killing. The 28-year-old could be eligible for release from the jail in the capital, Pretoria, in August to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. If prosecutors succeed in their appeal against the culpable homicide conviction in the Supreme Court of Appeal and have it upgraded to murder, Pistorius would face a minimum of 15 years in jail. Judge Masipa, who presided over Pistorius's seven-month murder trial and the start of the appeal process by prosecutors, made her latest ruling after a short court session in Johannesburg. Pistorius's trial was held in another courthouse in Pretoria. Failed bid: The athlete's lawyer Barry Roux (pictured) argued that prosecutors had 'mistakenly' been given permission to appeal against Judge Masipa's initial trial verdict of manslaughter . Prosecutor Gerrie Nel (above) said there was no basis for the application by the defence, which wanted a 'never-ending case' to prevent it from going to the appeal court . The judge heard arguments by Barry Roux, Pistorius's chief defence lawyer at trial, and Gerrie Nel, the chief prosecutor. Mr Roux argued that prosecutors had 'mistakenly' been given permission to appeal against Judge Masipa's initial trial verdict. Mr Nel said there was no basis for the application by the defence, which wanted a 'never-ending case' to prevent it from going to the appeal court. Pistorius's trial now looks set to be reviewed by a panel of judges at the Supreme Court of Appeal, which sits in the central city of Bloemfontein. No date has been given for that appeal but cases can sometimes take two years to reach the court, legal experts have said.

"A Muslim terror convert who tried to take his new-born baby to Somalia is suing the FBI and his own mother for 'conspiring to stop his on living in Jordan with his wife'. Zachary Chesser, of Virginia, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for attempting to support terrorist groups after his name appeared on the no-fly list at an airport in 2010. The 25-year-old had been on law enforcement's radar after posting threats against the creators of 'South Park' for cartoons he felt insulted the prophet Muhammad. Zachary Chesser (pictured), of Virginia, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for attempting to support terrorist groups after his name appeared on the no-fly list at an airport in 2010 . He was arrested as he attempted to leave America to join a terror group in Somalia - hoping that taking a baby with him to the airport would make him appear less suspicious. Chesser now lives in the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. His wife, a Ugandan diplomat's daughter named Proscovia Nzabanita, had to leave the United States in early 2011 after pleading guilty to lying about his plans the year before. The fate of their baby, Talhah, now five, remains at the center of a dispute being heard in federal appellate court this week. Chesser is suing the FBI and his own mother, alleging that agents interfered with his parental rights by conspiring with his mother and her partner to ensure that the boy could not travel to Jordan to live with his wife. Instead, the boy is being raised by his mother, Barbara Chesser, a senior lawyer in the Office of the Attorney General in the District of Columbia, and her partner, who is also named as a defendant. Chesser was behind bars and Nzabanita was facing deportation when his mother initiated custody proceedings, but both still enjoyed full parental rights, and they 'opposed placing the young boy with his grandparents, who did not share Chesser and his wife's conservative Islamic beliefs,' his court-appointed attorney, Wayne LaFond, says in their appeal. But Chesser is not seeking custody. Instead, he wants monetary damages. Chesser and his wife planned to travel together to Somalia where he would join al-Shabab extremists (file picture of al-Shabab fighters) Talhah was born in November 2009 to Chesser and his wife, a woman he met at a mosque in Washington, DC. They planned to travel together to Somalia where he would join al-Shabab, but Nzabanita's mother hid her passport. Then, in the summer of 2010, they tried again. This time, Nzabanita dropped off Chesser and the baby to make the trip without her. Soon, they were both arrested. Chesser was facing a lengthy prison sentence, and Nzabanita struck a plea deal requiring her to leave the country, likely for good. According to Chesser's complaint, agents monitoring his prison conversations in January 2011 tipped off Barbara Chesser that the young couple was making plans for a friend to take the boy to Jordan and join Nzabanita there. Chesser's complaint states that agents went to the airport to stop that trip. Soon thereafter, Barbara Chesser won full custody of the boy after a judge declared Chesser and Nzabanita to be unfit parents. LaFond argues that the FBI had no business disclosing the content of his conversations to intervene in a family custody dispute. 'Prisoners largely lose the right to keep secrets from the government,' he wrote, but 'they retain the right to keep those secrets from those outside the government.' Jailed: Chesser (pictured) now lives in the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado . Chesser was acting as his own lawyer when he first sued, in 2013. Judge Liam O'Grady dismissed that complaint, which remains under seal, as delusional and irrational. Chesser then amended his complaint, saying the essential facts remain accurate. 'It might not be particularly normal for the FBI to become so involved in a child custody proceeding ... but the scenarios described in the amended Complaint are far from fanciful,' he wrote. O'Grady again dismissed the lawsuit, saying Chesser had no expectation of privacy for conversations that occurred in a prison setting and therefore no reason to object when the FBI disclosed the conversation to his mother. The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond appointed LaFond to handle Chesser's appeal. 'Nothing alleged by Chesser is irrational or incredible. Chesser's complaint alleges that government agents misused confidential information they had gathered about him,' LaFond wrote. Lawyers for the FBI agents want a ruling that their actions are completely legal. They wrote that no precedent exists 'remotely suggesting that the disclosure of a parent's travel plans for a child can violate the parent's constitutional right to privacy,' especially when the disclosure revolves around plans to relocate a child out of the country ahead of a custody hearing. Barbara Chesser did not return calls seeking comment. This damages dispute is just the latest  turn in the saga. Addressing Chesser at his sentencing in 2011, O'Grady said he 'took just a shocking leap from a high-school athlete to a highly energized traitor.' Chesser's lawyers described a young man casting about for an identity, throwing himself headlong into whatever hobby consumed him. He joined a Korean breakdancing team, and became so fascinated with Japanese anime that he spent four years studying Japanese and traveled to Japan on a school trip. Then, he converted to Islam after becoming infatuated during his senior year with the daughter of Somali immigrants. That ended when he demanded they marry. Chesser's divorced father said his son became so radical, he was 'even wearing some type of loin cloth in place of underwear.' Chesser's name resurfaced earlier this year when the FBI named a 'close associate' of his in northern Virginia, Liban Mohamed, to its list of most-wanted terrorists.","Zachary Chesser was jailed for 25 years for attempting to support terrorists .

"From elaborate hats to colourful coats and skyscraper heels, this week's Cheltenham Festival has proved as memorable for its  fashion as it has for the drama unfolding on the course. But today, racing fans were left shivering in their flimsy frocks as the heavens opened and gave everyone a soaking. Luckily, most had come prepared with umbrellas, turning the racecourse into a sea of bright colour as the brollies were unfurled. Beneath them were racegoers dressed in an array of colourful ensembles, with some braving the downpour in bare legs and spike heels while trying desperately to keep their elaborate titfers dry. Scroll down for video . Chilly: A couple of ladies chose to brave the cold weather in bare legs and platform shoes, even leaving warm coats at home . Brrrr! Racegoers were left shivering after the heavens opened on the fourth and final day of this year's Cheltenham Festival . Well prepared: Most had come prepared with umbrellas but a few chose to brave the chill in bare legs regardless . Hidden: A lady arrives well wrapped up in a chic green tweed coat but is almost totally obscured behind her umbrella . Watch the hair! Others took shelter beneath large hats but those wearing fascinators had no choice but to carry a brolly . Not put off: It might have been raining but that didn't stop many racegoers from ramping up the glamour in their spike heels . Not impressed: Although some appeared to be enjoying the rain, others - particularly those with suspect brollies - looked less thrilled . Others went down a more practical route, wrapping up in cosy fur coats and oversized hats. More still, perhaps with an eye to the weather rather than fashion, shucked off their finery and replaced it with waterproof cagoules. Despite the downpours, most of the men and women arriving for the final day of racing action managed to look cheerful - perhaps with the prospect of seeing veteran jockey AP McCoy compete in the final Gold Cup of his career in mind. McCoy, who has won the prestigious trophy no fewer than five times during his 20-year career, will compete for the final time aboard the hotly-tipped Irish bay gelding, Carlingford Lough. 'It's impossible to not back AP McCoy's last ever ride in the Gold Cup,' comments Ladbroke's Jessica Bridge. 'It would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20-time champion jockey.

The progress of the race can be tracked by Zara's expression, from contemplative to anxious then resigned to defeat... But she seemed happy with the end result, centre, while Mike was also in high spirits, right . Making an entrance: Princess Anne arrived at Cheltenham having spent the morning at a service for soldiers in London . Anne was pictured cheering passionately during the race . The royal was gripped by the action and cheered and clapped as the horses races past their seats . Anne appears to be celebrating as she punches the air after the race . Day out: A beaming Strictly Come Dancing star Ola Jordan arrived hand-in-hand with husband James . 'Silviniaco Conti might be the heavily backed favourite, yet there's still question marks whether he can finally make it third time lucky at Cheltenham, but for the old romantics there's only one man that can win this year's Gold Cup, and it's AP McCoy.' Also on hand to see McCoy compete in his final Gold Cup was Zara Tindall who arrived looking glamorous in a brown wool coat by Irish designer Paul Costelloe and sporting a chic cocktail hat decorated with traditional pheasant feathers. Zara's appearance made it a full four out of four for the Queen's granddaughter, who made her first visit to the racecourse on Tuesday where she saw her and husband Mike's horse Monbeg Dude fail to deliver and take a lowly 14th place in his race. She reappeared for a second time on Ladies' Day and opted for another Costelloe ensemble, this time a black and grey checked coat and a detailed black cocktail hat. For the second day in a row, she spent most of her time watching the action unfold from the grandstand and chose not to join her aunt, the Duchess of Cornwall, in her private box. Today saw Zara joined for the event by her mother Princess Anne, who arrived in the early afternoon having come direct from a service held to honour the fallen of Afghanistan at St. Paul's Cathedral.

"A dad whose video of he and his nine-month-old baby surfing made waves on the internet is defending his decision to take the infant for a ride after critics called the sport too dangerous. Jorge Tirado, 43, of Puerto Rico spoke to Inside Edition's Les Trent about his choice to involve his little boy in the sport and film it all with his GoPro camera to upload online this week. Les Trent asked, 'I do think a lot of people seeing that video say that's not something you should do with a baby.' Scroll down for videos . No problem!: Jorge Tirado, 43, says his son was strapped to him and that he was there to ensure no harm came to his nine-month-old son . Tirado replied, 'For me, there is no problem. I'm never going to put the baby beyond any reach. The baby is stuck with me and his legs [are] on my stomach.' Tirado said that the sport is not dangerous but is actually enlightening for his son who was blessed to go into the ocean for the first time. 'My son first try. Thanks to everyone. 'I encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean, after all the ocean is the place where it all began. 'By far, this is the best sport for your spiritual, mental and physical health.' Like a pro: The footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board . At nine months old, babies, if they are really advanced, might be crawling around on the floor, or shuffling from A to B. However, this tiny tot has been filmed surfing - as his father takes him out on his bodyboard. In the video, Jorge can be seen holding his son, who is unnamed, and getting him ready for a day's surfing. The footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves, and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave. Although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water, it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves. Tirado does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in Puerto Rico. Not impressed... Jorge's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave . The baby is visible at the height of a huge wave, bracing himself for impact, with his father propped up over him . The baby looks surprised upon entry into the wave, but handles the impact well . As the two ride ride through the middle of the tube of a wave, the baby is all smiles at the motion . Just chilling: Jorge Tirado, 43, floats with his son in preparation before entering the waves . Beginner's nerves: At first the youngster does seem a little nervous when entering the cold water, but he soon learns to love the movement through the water . The baby is then seen in the water, with waves splashing over his face as he is held on the board. At times, the tot doesn't look impressed, as the water cascades over him. But he ends with a smile as he is joined by another surfer. While taking an infant out onto the waves can be dangerous, it is not uncommon for experienced surfers or bodyboarders to introduce their kids to the ocean at a young age. Pro-surfer John John Florence, 22, for example, has said that he was only six-months-old when his mother put him in a life vest and sat him on the nose of her surfboard as she paddled into waves.","Jorge Tirado, 43, took his son surfing in Puerto Rico .

"Fault lines dating back hundreds of millions of years in Oklahoma that have been recently reactivated could lead to a devastating quake in the state where many structures were not built to withstand major seismic activity, a report said. The state, which has seen several hundred seismic events over the past five years, has 'a high degree of potential earthquake hazards,' according to the study accepted for publication this month whose authors include researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). 'The majority of the recent earthquakes in central Oklahoma define reactivated ancient faults at shallow depths in the crust' of less than 3.7 miles (6 km), said the report for the American Geophysical Union. Scroll down for video . History: The state of Oklahoma saw more earthquakes in 2014 than ever before in its recorded history . Building codes in Oklahoma for seismic events are not as stringent as in quake-prone states such as California (here, maintenance workers inspect the damage to one of the spires on Benedictine Hall at St. Gregory's University in Shawnee after two quakes hit the area in less than 24 hours in 2011) The report did not look at whether the reactivation of the faults was linked to the energy extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. However, USA Today, reported that previous research has identified hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as being behind 3,600 small earthquakes in Oklahoma from 2009 - 2014. Daniel McNamara, one of the paper's authors and a research geophysicist at USGS, said on Tuesday the 300 million-year-old subsurface faults that had not been active are suspected to be associated with the recent seismic activity. 'Any one of these fault zones that are producing magnitude 3 or 4 earthquakes could rupture into a larger earthquake. There are as many as 12 different fault zones that are capable of producing a large, 5 to 6 magnitude earthquake,' he said. In November 2011, Oklahoma suffered a 5.6 magnitude quake that damaged more than a dozen homes and several businesses. Building codes in Oklahoma for seismic events are not as stringent as in quake-prone states such as California. Wastewater disposal related to the fracking is suspected by many scientists to contribute to the earthquake activity. Millions of gallons of waste water are typically trucked from a fracking site to wells where the water is injected thousands of feet underground into porous rock layers. Energy companies deny there is a link between fracking and major seismic activity. The 300-million-year-old fault lines in Oklahoma are being reactivated by multiple earthquakes in the state that scientists previously have said were linked to fracking - although the most recent research did not look at the energy extraction technique . In November 2011, Oklahoma suffered a 5.6-magnitude quake that damaged more than a dozen homes and several businesses (here, a man examines bricks that fell from three sides of his in-law's home in Sparks after two earthquakes hit the area in less than 24 hours during the large 2011 quake)","Deep fault lines older than the dinosaurs are being reactivated by small earthquakes .

"A grieving woman who overate following her mother's death told of how after dropping FIVE dress sizes in just one year her breasts shrunk from a 38E to a 34B – so she used her mother's inheritance to get implants. Emma Thair-White, 43, was prompted to lose weight after she gorged so much that whole pieces of food rose back up into her throat when she bent over to tie her shoelaces. The mother-of-two, who said she over-ate while grieving following her mother's death, was hugely successful and went from a 15-stone, size 22 to a ten-stone, size 12. Emma Thair-White piled on the pounds after the tragic loss of her mother, however, the 43-year-old has now dropped five dress sizes and had a boob job to lift and enlarge her sagging chest . Emma was left devastated after the death of her mother, Ethel (right) and turned to drink and food for comfort . But her breasts also took the hit – and shrunk from a 38E to a 34B. 'I didn't want to look in the mirror – I didn't like what it the weight loss had left,' she said, adding she was disgusted with her 'saggy' breasts. 'Every bra I put on, the skin just sat in there. I'd never lost my boobs throughout any diet, so it was a shock.' In 2014, she decided to use part of her mum's inheritance to get a breast uplift and 34F implants. Mrs Thair-White, from Grays, Essex, said: 'I wasn't sure about spending part of the inheritance on the operation but my husband Shane encouraged me,' she said. 'He said: 'You've always put the kids first, now it's time for you.' Mrs Thair-White told how she struggled to shift the pounds she had gained while pregnant with her children Eva, 16 and Max, 10, but her binge eating spiraled out of control after she lost her beloved mother Ethel to brain cancer in 2009. Emma, pictured here with her two children Eva (left) and Max (right) decided to lose the weight in 2013 after she became so big that she couldn't tie her shoelaces without food coming up into her mouth . Emma proudly shows off her weight loss holding up an old pair of her jeans, she was previously a size 22 but has now slimmed down to a size 12 . Emma is now a keen exerciser and a slim size 12, after realising in 2013 that she needed to do something about her weight . She was so devastated by the loss that she secretly turned to drink to ease the pain. 'It started off that I had a bottle of wine to toast [my mum], and things seemed a little bit rosier and it wasn't so painful,' she said. 'That one glass in the evening turned to two, then three, then four and then before I knew it I'd be ordering three bottles of wine in the shopping then, unbeknown to my husband, going and buying another three. 'I used to make sure if there was a lot of bottles in the recycling bin I'd put the rubbish straight in after. He didn't have a clue.' In 2010, she broke down and confessed all to her GP, who prescribed her a course of anti-depressants. 'One day I just woke up and decided I wasn't going to do it anymore and I needed help,' she said. She cut out drinking straight away. Emma was suffering from depression when she decided to give up drinking, however, she then turned to take-aways eating them two or three times a week . Emma is now happy to show off her slimmer figure in a variety of outfits, including this fancy dress costime . However, Mrs Thair-White was still battling with her weight – a fight she believes was made harder by her anti-depressants. 'The takeaways went from weekends to two or three times a week,' she said. It wasn't a few scoops of Ben and Jerry's, I'd have the tub. 'With my appetite, there is no off button. It is all down to my self control.' Classmates at son her Max's school even made cruel comments about him having a 'fat mum.' The final push she needed to kick-start her weight loss came in December 2013. She had been stocking the house with sweets and chocolate in the run-up to Christmas, but could not resist binging on the treats. 'I stacked up my cupboards and I used to sit and eat every night until I felt sick,' she said, 'We were going somewhere and I bent down to tie my shoes then all my food came back into my mouth because my tummy was so big. 'I just remember saying to my husband: 'I can't do this anymore.' Emma used some of the inheritance money left by her mother to pay for a boob job after her chest was left sagging following her weight loss regime . Emma's two children and husband encouraged her in her weight loss, they joined their mother on her healthy eating regime, promising her they would lose weight as a family . Her 42-year-old husband and two children also joined in with her new healthy regime, promising they would lose weight as a family. Mrs Thair-White threw herself into exercise, taking the family's dog Morris with her on speed walks. Progress was slow at first. When she had only managed to shed a stone after several months, she turned to Forza Raspberry K2 diet supplements. 'At the beginning when I wasn't on [the supplements], it was very slow,' she said, 'But after I started, it came off in leaps and bounds. 'The shape change spurred me on. I had a waist – it was a good feeling. The biggest thing is excuses. 'I've had so many people approach me and say they want to do it but there's all these 'buts', and I'll say to them that they're not ready. 'You've got to be in the frame of mind to do it. I've proved that you don't have to run – I speed walk. 'Even just walking helps, it's just making yourself active. I just want people to know there is always light at the end of any tunnel no matter how big or small, and looking after yourself really does make all the difference. Don't give up. It can be done.'

"An investigation into the shark meat sold at fish and chips stores has found the majority of retailers are mislabelling their produce. Eleven of the 23 Melbourne fish and chips shops examined by Greenpeace were found to be selling the overfished school shark despite advertising it as the sustainable gummy shark or 'flake' - a term that is only meant to be used for gummy shark or New Zealand's similar rig shark. Less than half of the stores, which had samples of their raw fillets DNA tested by the University of Canberra in September last year, were found to be accurately labelling their 'fish'. Greenpeace has investigated the shark species used by 23 Melbourne fish and chips shops as part of their campaig for restaurants to reveal the origin and type of their seafood . One of the restaurants labelling their fillets as gummy shark was found to be serving rig shark while another which was advertising flake was unable to be identified. 'Aussies are being sold 'fake' and chips, not flake and chips because of Australia's shoddy labelling laws,' campaigner Nathaniel Pelle said. 'Australians are being kept in the dark about where their seafood comes from, the type of fish they are eating, and how it reached their plate.' The results have formed part of the campaigning organisation's argument for the federal government to improve Australia's food labelling laws, demanding that they include a requirement for restaurants and take-away stores to declare the country of origin of their food. Eleven of the 23 Melbourne fish and chips shops examined by Greenpeace were found to be selling the overfished school shark (pictured) despite advertising it as gummy shark or flake . Greenpeace claims that current legislation does not require them to identify the fish type or origin. Its research further suggests that at least 80 per cent of the squid and octopus sold in Australia is caught overseas from overfished origins while two thirds of the popular fish type barramundi is brought in from Asia. Great concern has also been placed on the fate of many 'orange roughy' fish, which despite being managed through conservation efforts in Australia, is often sold under different names at various restaurants. Less than half of the stores, which had their raw fish DNA tested by the University of Canberra in September last year, were found to be accurately labelling their 'fish' as gummy shark (pictured) or flake . 'It is not possible for consumers to make an informed decision under these conditions — a situation that may result in negative environmental and health outcomes,' Ms Pelle said. 'Australians deserve labelling laws that tell us what fish we're eating, where it was caught and how it was caught.'

"The California mother who was charged with manslaughter last week in the death of her newborn son on Friday was arraigned on an upgraded murder charge. Samantha Green, 23, pleaded not guilty to the new count after Judge David Rosenberg rejected the defense's claim that the woman was the target of ‘vindictive prosecution.’ Prosecutors appealed to the judge to change Green's charge from manslaughter to murder after claiming to have uncovered new evidence in the death of her 20-day-old son, Justice Rees, over the past week. Overcome with emotion: Samantha Green, 23, is seen being comforted by her public defender Traice Olson Friday after pleading not guilty to an upgraded charge of murder in the death of her newborn son . Higher stakes: Prosecutors appealed to the judge to change Green's charge from manslaughter to murder after claiming to have uncovered new evidence . Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees (right) in swampy land near the Sacramento River last month after he and Green (left) were reported missing . In response, Green's public defender, Tracie Olson, demanded to be presented with the new information and accused the opposing side of moving the goalpost after her client had agreed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter, reported Sacramento Bee. Dressed in a striped green-and-white jumpsuit, Green appeared dejected and wept in court. Supervising Deputy District Attorney Rob Gorman declined to go into detail about the new evidence but defended the timing of the request to amend the complaint against Green. Gorman acknowledged that that while it may look ‘suspicious,’ the information they have obtained since Green’s arraignment March 4 warranted the charge upgrade. ‘We now believe that Ms. Green can be legitimately charged for murder,’ said Gorman. Green, of Woodland, made her first court appearance last Wednesday following her weekend arrest in the death of her baby son. The original charges against Green also included an enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury on a child under age five during the commission of a felony. The boy's body was found with no obvious signs of trauma last week in a swampy area. Sheriff's investigators said he may have died from drowning or hypothermia near the rural town of Knights Landing, about 30 miles west of Sacramento. Green, who had been reported missing with her son two and a half weeks ago, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. Last week, Green (pictured in court March 4) pleaded not guilty to an involuntary manslaughter charge in her baby's death . She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story. Despite the charges, Green's family said they are standing by her. 'Our family is grieving not only for the loss of our grandson Justice, but also the possible loss of our daughter Sami Green,' Green's parents, Randy and Laurie, said in a statement released on Sunday morning and shared by CBS. 'She has never been in trouble with the law. We know in our heart that Sami would never do anything to intentionally harm her newborn son Justice. She loved him very much. 'Her entire family supports her through this most unbelievable time in our lives.' Justice had methamphetamine in his system at birth, reported KCRA, but Green and the boy's father were allowed to take him home after passing a drug test and agreeing to a safety plan put forward by Child Protective Services. Samantha Green was reported missing February 24 after she failed to visit her father, Randy, three days earlier, as planned. Her partner Frank Rees posted on Facebook a day later begging Green to come home with their son. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fiancé [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' Her partner Frank Rees (right), who is also Justice's father, is supporting Green (left; right with Rees) Crews looked through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours before finding Justice's body, which Green said was in the water . Later that day, she called police to say she had been abducted with her son and that the boy was missing. Passerby Ricardo Villaseñor then came upon Green, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough, News 10 reported. Villaseñor said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' he said. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby had frozen to death, and though she said she didn't know exactly where he was, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and was later released. She was then arrested and charged with murder. After her arrest, Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto said: 'We have come to the conclusion that Mrs. Green was the sole individual responsible for the death of her child.'","Samantha Green, 23, pleaded not guilty to upgraded murder charge .

"The emotional toll endured by emergency room medics has been revealed by a moving photograph showing an ER doctor consumed by grief after losing a teenage patient. The image was posted to a website by a friend and colleague of the doctor who explained that a 19-year-old he was trying to save passed away. The doctor, wearing a white coat, is seen crouching down by the side of a road at night, with one hand holding a wall - the heart-ache of what he'd seen clearly too much to bear. An image of a doctor overwhelmed by grief after losing a 19-year-old patient has generated thousands of comments on a social media site . The poster, who works in California, said: 'Though this is a common occurrence in our field of work, the patients we lose are typically old, sick, or some combination of the two. The patient that died was 19 years old, and for him, it was one of those calls we get sometimes that just hits you.' The picture was first published on Reddit and has led to thousands of comments from touched users. One, ‘J-Hof’, wrote that the image ‘really hit home’ as it reminded him of the shock felt by ER medics after they failed to save his father’s life. The post read: ‘When he died the doctors who were working on him at the UCSD medical center were crushed. I could definitely see it in their eyes. They called my house multiple times throughout the year to see how my family was doing. Doctors do not get the praise they deserve.’ Reddit user Facetus, a medic, wrote: ‘I know exactly how the doc in the picture feels. Despite the picture showing such a dark moment it actually makes me feel happier about my career choice. I think it is the sense of connection with the unknown doc in the pic and the comments and reaction of Reddit community that makes me feel: what we do matters.’ Another user, livinbandit, said: ‘My dad is an ER doctor. I remember the times he would come home and cry in my mother’s arms because there was someone that he couldn't save no matter how hard he tried.’ Reddit users touched by the picture of the doctor left comments praising the work that the emergency services do .","Image posted on social media of grief-stricken doctor touched thousands .

Fifteen schoolchildren were evacuated from the bus when it caught fire on its way to a secondary school in Barnet, north London . The blaze was put out within half an hour after witnesses shared photographs of black smoke filtering through the sky from miles away. The man driving the bus, which belonged to Little Bus Company, has been praised for safely getting the children out in time. 'The driver was brilliant, he did exactly what he should and everyone is safe,' said the company's director, Jeremy Reese.

"John Prescott (above), deputy prime minister from 1997 to 2007, claimed that the rise in radicalised teenagers is down to Tony Blair's 'bloody crusades' John Prescott has suggested the rise in radicalised teenagers is down to Tony Blair 'wanting to invade everywhere'. The former Labour deputy prime minister claimed it was unsurprising that young Muslims were turning to extremism when they switch on the television to see 'more rockets being fired' in the Middle East. The comments were made at a fundraising event in Gainsborough on February 19 for Lord Prescott's son David. They come amid an increasing anxiety about the number of young students fleeing to the Middle East to fight for ISIS. The 76-year-old said: 'I was with Tony Blair on Iraq. We were wrong. They told us it wasn't regime change. It was. 'Now Tony, unfortunately is still in to that. I mean the way he's going now, he now wants to invade everywhere. 'He should put a white coat on with a red cross and let's start the bloody crusades again. 'Every time [people] watch the television where their families are worried, their kids are being killed and murdered and rockets firing on all these people, that's what radicalises them.' The event was just days before Ed Miliband announced Lord Prescott would be joining the Labour party as a special adviser on climate change, the Daily Telegraph reported. The decision to call on  Prescott ahead of the general election has be seen by some as an attempt to turn the clock back to when Labour used to win elections. The move was backed by Alastair Campbell, Blair's former spin doctor, who also pledged to join the effort to get Miliband elected. Scroll down for video . Prescott (left) said that 'unfortunately' Blair (right) still 'wants to invade everywhere'. They are pictured together on the second day of the Labour Party Annual Conference in September 2004 . It is not the first time Prescott has launched an offensive against Blair. In his memoirs he claims he called the former prime minister a 'little s***' during a blazing argument. He has similarly criticised Blair in the past for justifying regime change and using political force during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He wrote in a Mirror column last year: 'This is totally unacceptable and provokes people in communities angry about the West's actions. It is not the first time Lord Prescott (centre) has criticised Blair (right). In his memoir he claims he called the former Labour leader a 'little s***' during a blazing row . 'I challenged Tony about the danger of becoming involved with what Bush ­acknowledged was a crusade.' Bob Neill, the Conservative vice-chairman, said Prescott's latest comments show Labour has not changed. He said: 'Their bitter divisions would cause chaos for Britain if they got into Government.'

"From peacocks to birds of paradise, male birds are well known for showing off their brightly coloured plumage as a way of attracting a mate. However, new research has suggested that males birds may actually be growing less distinct from their female counterparts over time. The findings challenge a key element of the evolutionary theory that was first proposed by Charles Darwin 156 years ago. Male and female Choco Toucan's (pictured above) both share the same brightly coloured plumage, suggesting another force other than sexual selection is driving the evolution of bright colours in feathers of some birds . Rather than the bright colours of male birds appearing because of sexual selection - where a trait evolves over time because it is seen as attractive or a signal of fitness by the opposite sex - other forces of natural selection are at work. The researchers say that the environment a species lives in, how it cares of its young and migratory behaviour appear to influence a species plumage. Peacock tails may be hard to miss, but humans are unaware of the noise created by the bird's pretty plumage. Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate. Researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them. Most humans hear noises between 20 and 20,000 hertz. When peacocks shake their tale feathers, most humans hear a rustling sound. But the scienitsts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels, according to the study published in the journal Animal Behaviour. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males shrieking out in response. Experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound, but know that some can feel vibration through their legs. Professor Peter Dunn, a biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said: 'A lot of research has focused on how plumage color is related to mating success, especially in males. 'so this should hopefully get researchers to think more about how color affects survival, especially predation and foraging success, in both sexes.' The debate over the differences in colour between species of birds has raged ever since the time of Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. While Darwin based his theory of sexual selection on the idea that brightly coloured males were preferred by females, giving them a competitive advantage, Wallace pointed out that in many species females are as brilliantly coloured as the male. He suggested instead that the differences between the sexes - known as sexual dichromatism - were the result of females needing better camouflage to prevent their nests from being raided by predators. Some scientists have also puzzled at how bright plumage in males can have evolved when it potentially makes them a more visible target for predators. This would suggest that sexual preference for bright colours plays a more powerful role in determining the evolution of a species than other pressures. In an attempt to test these ideas, Professor Dunn and his colleagues decided to analyse the plumage of 977 species of bird - around 10 per cent of all known species. Using museum specimens, they measured the spectrum of light reflected from the plumage of both male and female birds. They found that on the whole males tended to have brighter feathers than females. Male northern cardinals usually have bright red plumage (left) while females are a drab grey or brown (right) This male Gouldian finch has bright and vibrant plumage. Females have similar colours but are not as bright . But in about 45 per cent of bird species both sexes had plumage that the same level of brightness. By looking at where the birds sat in the phylogenetic tree, however, they were able to conclude that over evolutionary time the colour difference between species appears to have declined. In some cases males have become duller in their colours while in others females have evolved brighter plumage. They found both sexes would have duller plumage when the birds tended have more sedentary behaviour or bred in the tropics or had young that needed more care, and in species where males played little role in caring for young. Peacocks have brightly coloured plumage that they shake to attract the much duller coloured peahens to mate . Writing in the journal Science Advances, Professor Dunn and his colleagues said: 'Although most studies of bird plumage focus on dichromatism, evolutionary change has most often led to similar, rather than different, plumage in males and females. 'Overall, both natural and sexual selection have influenced the evolution of bird coloration, but in many respects, they have acted on two different axes: sexual selection on an axis of sexual differences and natural selection on an axis of color (for example, dull or bright) in both sexes. 'Thus, debate about the causes of variation in bird coloration may be resolved by recognizing that natural and sexual selection have generally acted on two different axes.' Biologists have been baffled as to how male Iberian emerald lizards have evolved their vivid blue and green colouring. While the brightly coloured skin it useful for attracting a mate, it should also make them easy for predators to spot. However, researchers from the University of Valencia in Spain and the Unviersity of Porto, Portugal, have found that these 15 inch long lizards have a secret weapon against hungry birds of prey - their own cloaking device. They discovered that the lizards' skin is iridescent and reflects light in different ways depending on the angle it is viewed from. When viewed from above, the creatures blend into their background and become almost invisible to birds. However, when viewed from ground level, the lizards still stand out brightly - meaning fellow lizards can easily spot those looking for mate. Iberian emerald lizard's skin makes the invisible from above but gives them bright colours at ground level .","Study was conducted by researchers at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee .

"An investigation has been launched after an Army platoon was accused of racially abusing its own soldiers in an event known as 'Racial Thursdays'. The sickening tradition allegedly has been taking place among soldiers in the 2nd Platoon, C Company, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. The Army Times first reported on the racist behavior after several soldiers, who wished to remain anonymous, came forward. One staff sergeant, who is black, told the newspaper this week: 'When I first got to my unit, someone said we should do ''Racial Thursdays'' because it's been a tradition. 'It's something they made up where you can say any racist remark you want without any consequences. The platoon sergeant said no, but the s*** is still going on.' A platoon based at Fort Wainwright in Alaska (pictured) has been placed under investigation after it emerged that they were holding 'Racial Thursdays' - when any racist remark was allowed without consequence. Another soldier of lower rank verified the story but also asked to remain anonymous. He said that a Latino colleague was badgered with racial slurs for hours until he almost got into a fight with another soldier. 'Racial Thursdays' were reportedly taking place at the same unit in Alaska where Pvt Danny Chen (pictured) once belonged. The solider, 19, committed suicide in 2011 after what investigators said was weeks of abuse and racial slurs . The platoon leader allegedly encouraged the practice 'to build morale and camaraderie', The Army Times reported. 'Racial Thursdays' have allegedly been taking place at the same unit where Private Danny Chen once belonged, The Army Times reported. The 19-year-old infantryman from New York City shot himself in a guard tower in southern Afghanistan in October 2011 after what investigators described as weeks of physical abuse, humiliation and racial slurs. The young soldier endured attacks on a daily basis for six weeks from fellow soliders who singled him out for being Chinese-American. He was taunted with the slurs 'gook', 'chink' and 'dragon lady', according to reports, beaten and put on excessive guard duty to the point of exhaustion. The day of his death he was made to crawl 100 yards over gravel carrying equipment while rocks were thrown at him by fellow soldiers. In December  2011, the Army charged eight soldiers with various crimes relating to Chen's death. Four soldiers were ultimately court-martialed. In a statement to Daily Mail Online, the U.S. Army in Alaska said: 'We are already aware of these allegations, as an informal complaint was made through command channels about this alleged behavior. The command has assigned an investigating officer and the investigation is ongoing. The command is extremely sensitive to any complaints that involve equal opportunity or discrimination and will investigate every allegation. 'It's important to emphasize that these allegations are just that. They're allegations, and that's what the investigation has been assigned to find out, exactly what happened and if anything happened. 'Based on the results of that inquiry, and if the evidence supports it, the commander, usually the brigade commander, can elect to conduct a 15-6 investigation. 'Treating all soldiers with dignity and respect is something this command takes extremely seriously, and when there are any indications that those values are not being followed, the command will absolutely make inquiries, conduct appropriate investigations and take action as necessary.'","Soldiers revealed the tradition at Fort Wainwright was when colleagues were allowed to abuse each other with racial slurs - without consequence .

"The unseen damage that Top Gear UK's presenters inflicted on three cars, which are worth a combined $1 million, while rounding up cattle and racing in the outback has finally been revealed. Pictures of the yellow Bentley Continental V8S, that was driven by Richard Hammond during the 22nd season episode, show the car covered in red dust with its front grill completely removed as it sits suspended in a mechanic workshop. Hammond and his co-stars James May and Jeremy Clarkson had their pick of top vehicles to thrash around in a cattle station and an open mine in the Northern Territory during their visit to Australia in October last year. Scroll down for video . The yellow Bentley Continental  has reportedly lost  50 per cent of its original value after Top Gear's Richard Hammond used it to round up cattle in the Australian outback during filming for their latest season . Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May had their pick of top cars to thrash around during their visit to the Northern Territory . Even though the underbodies of the three cars received extensive damage, car companies said the global exposure their brands expected to receive from being on the popular show would far outweigh any repair costs . Photos of the Bentley were sent to The Supercar Kids which reported that the vehicle lost at least 50 per cent of its original value due to the damage it received. It is understood that the three cars were returned mechanically sound, but in dire need of cosmetic touch-ups including a complete re-spray. The underbody of the cars were reported to have received a large amount of damage. 'The rectification work required was indeed cosmetic, to repair paint chips and scratches etc, which is unsurprising and acceptable after hundreds of miles on unsealed roads in the Northern Territory,' a spokesperson for Bentley UK told Fairfax. The before shot: The new Bentley continental stretching its legs on the open road in Australia's Northern Territory . The Bentley was covered in red dust after thrashing around a cattle station and open mine in Australia's Northern Territory . The Bentley, worth over $AU400,000, had to have its front grill completely removed in the workshop after the outback filming session . Pictures of the Nissan GT-R and BMW M6 Gran Coupé that May and Clarkson drove are yet to emerge, however they are understood to have required similar touch-ups. The car companies are reported to have been entirely aware of the activities planned for the cars and the potential risk of damage. A Nissan spokesman told Fairfax that the costs were worth the global exposure that the brands would receive by having their cars involved in the popular show. In a Q&A session with fans called An Evening With Top Gear, which was  broadcast on the show's YouTube channel,  Clarkson, May and Hammond spoke about their time in the country. The trio revealed how they came face-to-face with all of the elements from snakes, to cows to the boiling hot weather. Big fans! Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, pictured here in the Northern Territory in October,  have said in a chat called An Evening With Top Gear that they loved filming some of the 22nd season in the Australian outback . Happy to slum it: The show's host had no qualms camping in the outback . Full-throttle: Jeremy Clarkson said the Top Gear team had the time of their lives racing through Australia's Northern Territory for their latest series . But despite the gruelling environment, Clarkson said they had the time of their lives: 'We genuinely loved the Northern Territory,' the 54-year-old beamed. 'It was a brilliant trip. We loved the Northern Territory,' Hammond agreed. Part of the tasks taken on by the car fanatics was rounding up some 4,000 cows on a 3.2million acre farm as the cameras rolled. 'When we're looking for 4,000 cows we could have been in the equivalent of Southampton. We could have been in Harwich, or Banbury or Dover [in the UK]. It's that big, that's how big the farm is,' May explained. Put through their paces: Armed with a yellow Bentley Continental, a Nissan GTR and a BMW M6 grand coupe, the car fanatics were tasked to round up some 4,000 cows on a 3.2 million acre farm . Tough team! The trio came face-to-face with all of the elements from snakes, to cows to the boiling hot weather . Doing his best Australian accent, he added: 'I said to the farmer: How are we going to find them? He said: 'Don't worry, I'll put them all in the paddock for you'. 'I said that's very kind of you, how big is the paddock? He said: '39,000 acres.' That's a paddock?!' 'Australia needs a new unit of measurement because the acre is simply not big enough,' Clarkson mused. The Top Gear hosts also spoke about their struggle with the time 11-hour time difference between England and Australia. 'I did enjoy it, yes. Apart from the time difference thing when they imagine it's eight o'clock in the morning, when we know [it's not], because we invented the time in Britain,' May joked. No mean feat: 'When we're looking for 4,000 cows we could have been in the equivalent of Southampton. We could have been in Harwich, or Banbury or Dover [in the UK]. It's that big,' Jeremy explained . The Top Gear BMW M6 Gran Coupé, Bentley Continental V8S and Nissan GT-R before being put to work at a 'Top End' cattle station . While the show has catapulted the hosts into a world of unimaginable wealth and success, the men were more than happy to rough it up, admitting they had no qualms swapping five-star accommodation for swags and tents. 'It wasn't luxurious but it wasn't terrible,' May said.","Richard Hammond, James May and Jeremy Clarkson had their pick of top cars to thrash around during their visit to the Northern Territory .

"A Los Angeles attorney and single mom who is battling terminal lung cancer that has spread to her brain is launching a campaign for the right to end her own life, in a case that echoes that of Brittany Maynard. Terminal: Christy O'Donnell, 46, is battling lung and brain cancer and now fighting to die with dignity . Christy O'Donnell, a former police officer, says she has exhausted all her medical options in her battle against Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, which has masticated into a golf ball-sized tumor in her brain. Despite surviving the six months life expectancy she was given upon being diagnosed last June, the 46-year-old has been told her death will be painful, as her lungs continue to fill with fluid that will inevitably drown her. 'I think it's a terrible injustice that I don't have the choice to die in the manner I want to and instead that I'm forced to very likely die in protracted pain and I might even die alone,' O'Donnell told People magazine in a new feature. O'Donnell is now using what time she has left to support a  Death with Dignity law in California, having been inspired by Maynard, the 29-year-old California woman who moved to Oregon to take her own life last year, ending a long battle with brain cancer. O'Donnell says she wants to be able to do the same in the bed of her home in Valencia, with her 20-year-old daughter, Bailey Donorovich, holding her hand. She says her greatest fear is that her daughter will come home one day and find her mother dead. O'Donnell said she went to the doctors last year after waking up one morning and not being able to read properly. A big book worm, she had been reading before going to bed the night before, only to wake and hardly make out the letters of some words. She had her eyes checked, but the results came back fine. O'Donnell then called her physician and explain what happened, and the doctor told her to immediately go to the emergency room. Legacy: Brittany Maynard, 29, moved from California to Oregon - one of five U.S. states where terminally ill patients are legally allowed to kill themselves - to take her own life in November . An MRI and some other tests confirmed her shocking diagnosis. 'Bailey grabbed my hand and I just started crying and said, ''I'm so sorry'',' O'Donnell told People. 'What I was really saying was, ''I'm so sorry I'm going to die and leave you without a mom''.' O'Donnell underwent chemotherapy and has taken part in numerous clinical trials. However her prognosis has not changed. 'There is not anything medically we have not explored,' O'Donnell said. 'So it is not like I haven't exhausted all my options. My opinion is an informed one.' Doctors say the tumor in O'Donnell's lungs causes fluid to build up. She will soon have to undergo a painful procedure to empty the fluid, however it will fill up again almost immediately. 'There's a good likelihood (my daughter) will come home from work, come home from school, and find me dead,' an overwhelmed O'Donnell told People TV. In memoriam: Three California lawmakers are promoting right-to-die legislation with the family of Brittany Maynard (pictured with husband Dan Diaz), a terminally ill woman who ended her life early under Oregon law on November 1 . Love: Brittany Maynard and Dan Diaz married at the Beltane Ranch in California's wine country on September 29, 2012 . O'Donnell is now hoping to fight not just to stay alive until Brittany's 21st birthday in June, but for the law to allow her to die the way she wants. 'In the short amount of time I have left, I want to spend it with my daughter - she and I are doing this together - and I want to speak out in whatever way possible to start that dialogue with the public, with the legislature and the courts, and try and impact change,' O'Donnell said. O'Donnell's case is incredible similar to that of Maynard. Her family - lead by mother Debbie Ziegler - are now trying to pass a bill that would allow terminally ill patients to kill themselves in California with drugs and dosages recommended by a doctor. The practice is legal in five states, including Oregon, where Maynard moved before her suicide on November 1. Hoping for change: Debbie Ziegler, the mother of Brittany Maynard, speaks in support of proposed legislation allowing doctors to prescribe life ending medication on Wednesday January 21, 2015, in Sacramento . The 29-year-old San Francisco Bay Area woman had made her case public with online videos, saying in clips that were viewed tens of millions of times that she should have been able to legally obtain life-ending drugs in California. 'Most Californians would not be able to do what we did,' Ziegler said. 'They couldn't leave their homes; they couldn't leave their jobs; they couldn't leave their families, their friends, their pets. 'We had to do all of that. It added another layer of pain.' Maynard wrote in her final Facebook post: ""Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me ... but would have taken so much more .","Christy O'Donnell, 46, diagnosed with Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma in June and given six months to live .

"A ten-year-old Jack Russell called Jake was rescued from a 165ft-high cliff face after spending two days stuck on a ledge. The dog fell over the edge of a chalk cliff at an old quarry, which overlooks a residential street in Chafford Hundred, Essex, and landed on a narrow ledge about 30ft from the top. The animal spent two days on the cliff face before its barks were eventually heard by nearby residents. The  Jack Russell, called Jake, was rescued by a team of firefighters (pictured together) from a 165ft-high cliff face after spending two days stuck on a ledge after falling off the edge of  cliff in Chafford Hundred, Essex . The ten-year-old dog was coaxed back to safety by firefighters, who were lowered down onto the cliff ledge before offering the animal food. Jake has now been taken in by the RSPCA which is trying to find its owner . The dog became stuck on a ledge 30ft from the top of this chalk cliff face in Chafford Hundred, Essex . Fire crews spent four hours rescuing the animal yesterday and managed to retrieve it after firefighters were lowered down to the ledge on ropes and coaxed it to safety with food. Incident commander John Harris, of Essex County Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Jake was trapped on a small ledge about 10 metres from the top of the cliff. 'It's a sheer drop of about 50 metres so he was in a bit of a predicament. 'Neighbours told us that he's been on there for a couple of days at least because they've heard him barking and yelping. 'The team used lines to lower themselves down the cliff to the ledge Jake was on. 'They had a basket to put Jake in and bring him back up.' He added: 'At first Jake was scared and backed away from them but they had taken some food with them and they used that to coax him over and get him in the box.

The animal was checked over by a vet and is now in the hands of the RSPCA which is trying to find the dog's owner. The RSPCA said: 'We were able to take the dog to a local vet and fortunately other than being shaken up and cold he seemed to be fine and is currently being checked over.

"In a tunnel dug deep underneath the besieged Gaza Strip, masked gunmen from Islamic Jihad ferry rockets and mortars back and forth, preparing for the next conflict with Israel. Six months ago, the Palestinian militant group emerged battered and bruised from a 50-day conflict with Israel, where it fought alongside fellow Islamist movement Hamas, which controls Gaza. Islamic Jihad's armed wing the Al-Quds Brigades lost 123 men, but fired 3,249 rockets at the Jewish state, it says, including Iranian-made Fajr 5 missiles which reached Tel Aviv and even northern Israel. Heavily armed: Palestinian militants from the Islamic Jihad's armed wing, the Al-Quds Brigades, squat in a tunnel used for ferrying rockets and mortars back and forth in the Gaza Strip . The conflict, where Israel tried to flush out Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants by bombarding the coastal enclave, killed nearly 2,200 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and 73 people on the Israeli side, mostly soldiers. But the group says it is resurgent. 'We're at our highest level of alert to counter any attack. We're used to the occupation (Israel) breaking its ceasefires,' senior commander Abu al-Bara told journalists from inside one of the group's tunnels. 'What doesn't kill us makes us stronger. We're gathering all our strength since it's a war that never ends. We're ready to go to another level against the Zionist occupation and carry out actions we've never done before,' he said, without elaborating. The war ended on August 26 with a fragile Hamas-Israel ceasefire brokered by Egypt. In the meantime, Islamic Jihad has sought to replace its fallen comrades, and its manpower is estimated at between 10,000 and 15,000 fighters. Hamas and Islamic Jihad refuse to specify the number of fighters, or rockets, they currently possess, but both were severely depleted by the Israeli assault, which included ground combat. Under cover: Palestinian militants hide in a tunnel used for ferrying rockets and mortars back and forth in preparation for the Islamic Jihad's next conflict with Israel . Israel's ground invasion was aimed at destroying the hundreds of tunnels Gaza's two main Islamist groups had built, both for smuggling supplies and for attacks inside Israel. Islamic Jihad and Hamas staged deadly assaults on Israeli troops using the tunnels. For the first time, AFP news correspondents were permitted to enter a tunnel, provided they were blindfolded whilst being taken to them, so as not to give away its location. Inside, placards had been erected on the concrete walls, naming 'streets' to help militants navigate the network. One route was named after Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, the first Islamic caliph following the Prophet Mohammed's death in 632; another, Othman Ibn Affan, a successor. Quds fighters said the group had a network of tunnels of 'different lengths, some with several entrances'. But they were silent on the network's location or how it was built. Still there: Israel's ground invasion during the 50-day war with Palestinian militants in the summer of 2014 was aimed at destroying the hundreds of tunnels used by Gaza's two main Islamist groups . Their weapons were made inside Gaza, they said, but without elaborating on how the parts were obtained or purchased. It was an open secret before July 2013 that smuggling tunnels underneath the Egyptian border brought in much of Gaza's construction and fuel needs, money, and weapons, or the material to make them. But Egypt destroyed the vast majority after the military ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi and a crackdown was launched against his Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas's ally. Islamic Jihad, founded like Hamas in the 1980s, traditionally has its closest ties with Tehran, having been inspired by the Iranian revolution. Israel accuses the groups of continuing to seize construction material entering Gaza to make tunnels and weapons. 'Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have openly declared that they are rebuilding tunnels and testing rockets and other things like that,' army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said. 'They've been siphoning off from the civilians of Gaza forever,' he said, warning that Israel was prepared for further confrontation.

Underground and overground, the Quds Brigades lie ready.In the southern city of Khan Yunis, a banner reads: 'School of the Mujahedin'. Some 200 new recruits aged 19 to 22 are training at the camp, ducking under live fire, jumping through flaming hoops and shouting 'Death to Israel! Death to America!'. Instructor Abu Ahmed says the masked young men are going through 'very advanced training'. 'Their training lasts between 36 days and six months, before they go to a specialised unit like explosives or sharp shooting,' he said. 'We don't just have tunnels - we also invest in people,' Abu al-Bara interjected. 'With ideas and fighting, it is people who will liberate this land.'","Jihadis are using tunnels to smuggle weapons beneath the Gaza Strip .

"Cocaine use in Britain has trebled in two decades, with a new 'phenomenon' of rising drugs consumption among people in their forties and fifties. A new government report launched amid concern that cocaine is seen as safe found it is no longer 'the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities'. Its authors found the drug is now 'firmly embedded in UK society', and warned launching an anti-cocaine campaign could encourage more people to take it. Cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens, but there have been significant increases among people in their forties and fifties . The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said the drug has spread throughout all areas of society since the mid-1990s. It follows the emergence of a market in cheap, low-purity powdered cocaine that operates alongside a more expensive and far higher purity version of the drug. A line of the cheaper version can now be bought for just £2 – less than the price of a coffee. Cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens but while usage among younger age groups has fluctuated in recent years, figures from the Office for National Statistics show the percentage of over-35s taking cocaine at least once in the past year increased from 0.8 per cent in 2001/2 to 1.5 per cent in 2013/14 – the equivalent of about 188,000 men and women. Over the same period, use among adults described as ‘comfortably off’ rose from 1.5 per cent to 1.9 per cent. Overall just over 810,000 men and women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales used the drug at least once last year – 2.4 per cent of the population. It is the highest rate in Europe. Use among older adults has been less common, particularly among 45-54 year olds. In 2013-14, 1.8 per cent of people aged 34-44 took cocaine up from 1.3 per cent a decade earlier. Among 45-54-year-olds the figure doubled from 0.3 per cent to 0.6 per cent. But the report said: 'It is notable that there have been statistically significant increases (1996 to 2013-14) across all age groups up to the age of 54 years; a phenomenon that has not been observed in respect of other drug types.' It could be that more people are taking up cocaine later in life, but the data suggests it is the result of 'continued use among an ageing user cohort', suggesting age does not lead to people giving the drug up. The access to cheap cocaine - often mixed with harmful cutting agents - is 'highly likely' to have driven the rise in the number of users from 'hard pressed' or low income backgrounds, as well as the 'comfortably off', living outside cities where drug use was traditionally uncommon. The report, addressed to Home Secretary Theresa May and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is the first of its kind to investigate powdered cocaine use and was launched in response to fears of a perception that the drug is safe as use increased. Cocaine use has trebled in two decades, although the proportion of people saying they have used drugs in the last year has fallen sharply . Professor Les Iversen, chair of the ACMD, an independent body which advises the Government, said: 'Consumption of powdered cocaine in the United Kingdom has changed radically over the last two decades. 'Once characterised as the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities, the research highlighted in this report shows a cheaper, low-purity version of the drug has permeated society far more widely. Cocaine use has now become 'firmly embedded' in UK society . 'Given the clear health risks associated with even infrequent cocaine use, and associated issues such as dependency and crime, this development has posed a huge challenge to health professionals, law enforcement, educators and academics.' He added: 'I believe the drug is firmly embedded in UK society.' Using data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, the report said 0.6 per cent of 16-59 year-olds took powdered cocaine in 1996, compared to a peak of 3 per cent - or 885,000 people - in 2008-09. While the report said a slight fall in use since 2009 - to 743,000 people in 2013/2014 - could be a sign of a general decline in the UK, Mr Iversen said it is not yet significant. Despite the rise Tim Miller, one of the authors of the report, said only a small minority of people use cocaine and warned against launching an anti-cocaine education campaign. 'I think we need to tread carefully around drugs education and prevention because it can backfire,' he said. 'One of my worries is that if people think everyone is doing it then they might think it's OK to do it.' The drug can cause significant harm even in first-time or occasional users, including strokes, heart attacks, over-heating of body temperature to life threatening levels and psychiatric problems. Health problems are also caused by cutting agents used to make the drug more profitable - including levamisole used to worm sheep - which can lower blood cell numbers and phenacetin which can cause kidney problems. The report also found in the last year cocaine use was also found to be more than twice as popular among gays and bisexuals compared to heterosexuals. A Home Office spokesman said the department 'continues to be concerned about the harms caused by cocaine use, which is why it is a Class A drug'. 'There are positive signs our approach to this drug is working: the use of powder cocaine has fallen since a peak in 2008/2009 and there is a long-term downward trend in overall drug use,' he said. 'Law enforcement continues to tackle the supply of cocaine at home and abroad and the Coalition Government has introduced new powers to combat the trade in cutting agents, which are mixed with drugs by criminals to boost their profits. 'We are grateful to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs for its review and recommendations on the use, prevalence and harms associated with powder cocaine. We will consider its advice carefully and respond in due course.' Dr Niall Campbell, consultant psychiatrist at the Priory Hospital in Roehampton, South-West London, said: ‘People want an instant antidepressant, and they think cocaine is it, but it absolutely isn’t. We see lives totally wrecked by it.’ A multi-millionaire businessman’s 40-year marriage was destroyed by his £6,000-a-week cocaine addiction which started in middle age, a High Court judge said yesterday. The 62-year-old grandfather, who has not been named, is likely to die if he does not kick his habit, Mr Justice Moor warned during a divorce settlement hearing. The judge described how the man, worth £25million, risked throwing everything away after being introduced to the class A drug eight years ago, as his addiction led to ‘reckless and wanton’ spending on cocaine and prostitutes. After leaving school without qualifications the man built his property maintenance company from scratch, which now has a turnover of £24million a year, and lived with his wife in a £2.3million home with an indoor swimming pool. The couple own two villas on the Costa del Sol, a fleet of luxury cars including two Bentleys, two Porsche Cayennes and a Mercedes, and enjoyed £60,000 holidays in Dubai. But the childhood sweethearts, who married in 1972 and have four children and several grandchildren, finally separated in May 2012 because of his drug abuse. The husband has spent £230,000 on rehab in the US and Portugal but each time he relapsed after returning to the UK, the court heard. Mr Justice Moor said: ‘There is no doubt that the effect has been disastrous both for his health and for the state of his otherwise entirely happy marriage.’ The judge added: ‘Whoever introduced him to cocaine in his early 50s deserves a very long prison sentence as that person has destroyed a 40-year marriage. The husband has not been able to act on the advice of his treating professionals. If he does not, it will probably kill him. At the very least, it will cause his family yet more turmoil.’","Cocaine no longer just 'the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities'

"The young father who went missing with his baby son and taunted police as they searched for him came forward today and was arrested for assault and criminal damage. Kieran Carroll, 22, of Luton, Bedfordshire, was reported missing at around midday on Tuesday along with his eight-month-old son Louis. After reappearing following a three-day police search he was arrested today for assaulting a woman and damaging her mobile phone - offences which allegedly committed on the day he went missing. Came forward: Kieran Carroll, 22, from Luton, has reappeared with his eight-month-old son Louis (right, together) after going missing for three days. Police released CCTV footage of the father in their search (left) Currently he is not facing any charges for disappearing with his son. A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said: 'A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of common assault against a woman and criminal damage of a mobile phone. 'Both incidents are believed to have happened in Luton on Tuesday 3 March. 'The man was arrested in Kempston earlier today. He was later released on bail with stringent conditions and is due to report back to Luton police station on 31 March.' On Wednesday, police searching for the pair released CCTV footage from the day before showing him pushing a pram as he left a hotel in the town at about 2pm. Taunt: This comment, posted in response to a police appeal, is believed to have come from one of three accounts belonging to Mr Carroll . In response: Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post with this message . Relief: Bedfordshire Police were concerned Mr Carroll did not have any supplies for baby Louis . When Mr Carroll's image was shared on Facebook by Bedfordshire Police, a profile understood to belong to the father posted: 'I'm fine, so is my child - go look for some killers'. The force also published a photo of Louis on Facebook, along with new details on the search. The taunting response came from one of three accounts believed to belong to Mr Carroll, police said. Later, the same 'Kieran Carroll' profile commented again, saying, 'If any one is commenting and don't no me or what's really going on... stay out of my life you don't no me.' It is understood that Mr Carroll attended Bedford College, Bedfordshire, and lives with his girlfriend, Louis' mother, at a home in Luton. The 20-year-old woman is believed to have a three-year-old son from a previous relationship. Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post, saying: 'Kieran – Thank you for posting on our Facebook page. 'We are pleased to hear that you and Louis are safe.' 'All we need to do is see you and Louis in person to check you are safe and well. Please call us on 101 so we can arrange to meet you. We cannot close this case until we see you.' Found: Mr Carroll's disappearing act was said to be 'out of character'. Today he was arrested and bailed for assault and criminal damage - offences which allegedly committed on the day he went missing . Before the father came forward, another commenter on the Facebook page, Chantelle Louise White, said: 'You lot make out that he ant fine I know him for years and he won't do nuttin to he's son… He's looked after my son when he was the sane age! [sic]' And Mr Carroll's sister, Alix Carroll, 24, wrote: 'My brother is an amazing father - he has his boy more than the mother does. 'He's scared he's going to lose him - it's no different to if it was the other way round. 'Never in a million years would he harm a hair on his body. He will be safe - I bet my life on it.' Posting on Facebook, she added that she didn't know where her brother was, but that 'Louie is safe and there both okay [sic].' Earlier, police described the father's disappearance as 'completely out of character' and said they were concerned because they thought Mr Carroll did not have any supplies for the baby.","Kieran Carroll, of Luton, came forward today following a three-day search .

"A crocodile-like amphibian that was the size of a small car dominated prehistoric lakes more than 200 million years ago, a new study has found. Palaeontologists discovered the fossilised remains of the 'super salamander' while excavating on the site of an ancient lake in southern Portugal. The predator, which grew to be around two metres (6.5 ft) in length and lived in lakes and rivers during the Late Triassic Period, has been named Metoposaurus algarvensis. Scroll down for video . Metoposaurus algarvensis, shown in the reconstruction above, would have been the size of a small car . With a mouth filled with sharp needle-like teeth it is thought to have preyed upon fish but could also have snapped up any small early dinosaurs that got to close to the water. The researchers behind the discovery, which was made in mudstone flats close to Loulé, in the Algarve region of southern Portugal, say that the new species was similar to other primitive amphibian that were widespread at the time. The rare giant salamander is thought to be one of the world's oldest species. It first appeared on the planet around 170 million years ago but there are now just a handful of surviving populations left in the wild. The Chinese giant salamander are now the largest living amphibians and can grow to be up to 1.8 metres (5.9 feet) in length. A Park Ranger holds the giant Chinese salamander found in Heyuan City, Guangdon Province, China . However, pollution of the rivers and streams where they live has put the species under threat. A park ranger in southern China recently caught a giant salamander weighing 5.5kg and measufing 83cm in length in Heyuan City in southern China's Guangdong Province, the first of its kind to be found in the area. After keeping it in a temporary tank, officials released the creature back into the river, watched by a crowd of fascinated tourists. They say they were probably the forerunners of modern amphibians such as frogs, newts and salamanders. Dr Steve Brusatte, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who led the study, said: 'This new amphibian looks like something out of a bad monster movie. 'It was as long as a small car and had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head, which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut. 'It was the type of fierce predator that the very first dinosaurs had to put up with if they strayed too close to the water, long before the glory days of T. rex and Brachiosaurus.' Scientists said the giant creature (illustrated) would have terrorised lakes during the rise of the dinosaurs . The researchers, whose work is published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, discovered the remains of Metoposaurs algarvensis on the bed of an ancient lake. It was found within a large bed of bones where several hundred of the creatures may have died when the lake dried up. The image above shows the fossilised skulls of Metoposaurus algarvensis excavated in Portugal's Algarve . So far the researchers have excavated just four square meters of the lake and say they could find hundreds of creatures preserved in the mudstone. Most species of giant salamander-like amphibians were wiped out during a mass extinction 201 million years ago which marked the end of the Triassic period. This was when the supercontinent of Pangea began to break apart and paved the way for the dominance of the dinosaurs. Other species of Metoposaurus have been found in parts of Africa, Europe, India and North America. Dr Richard Butler, another researcher involved in the study and a palaeontologist at the University of Birmingham, said: 'Most modern amphibians are pretty tiny and harmless. 'Back in the Triassic these giant predators would have made lakes and rivers pretty scary places to be.'","Metoposaurus algarvensis grew up to 2 metres long and preyed upon fish .

"Shamed payday lenders are still hounding vulnerable customers suffering from illness and bereavement despite pressure to clean up the industry, a report has found. Only one year after a new regulator was tasked with keeping loan companies in check, many are still employing bully boy tactics when a customer defaults on their repayments. The Financial Conduct Authority found that certain firms continued to be 'unsympathetic and inflexible' where a customer was in 'distress and financial difficulty'. The watchdog said one lender had even tried to extract money from customers by 'threatening visits to their home or place of work', despite having no policy to do so. Hounded: A year after the Financial Conduct Authority was tasked with regulating payday lenders, its report finds the firms are still hounding vulnerable customers (file photo) Others threatened to pass on customers' accounts to external debt collectors, even though they had no intention of doing so. The FCA said it uncovered 'misleading and occasionally threatening correspondence from lenders', despite an attempt to clamp down on such behaviour. David Mann, at comparison site uSwitch.com, said last night: 'It's shocking that vulnerable people are still being hounded, even when they're taking steps to get their debts under control. 'It's clear that more needs to be done to protect those trapped in a vicious circle of debt. 'There is a need for short term credit, but payday loans can be a very expensive way to borrow money. We need high street banks to step up and offer robust short term lending solutions.' Last April, the FCA was put in charge of regulating the payday industry in an attempt to tackle the number of people spiralling into unmanageable debt through these high-interest short-term loans. But the FCA's own report found evidence that high-risk applicants were still being accepted for loans, even where lenders had 'grounds to suspect that customers were at risk of, or already in, financial difficulties'. They said shambolic record-keeping meant calls and emails from customers admitting they were in difficulty and could not pay often 'fell through gaps' in the system. In some cases, companies had a backlog of correspondence from debt advice charities stretching back several weeks, meaning lenders were completely unaware of why customers had defaulted on their loan. This included medical evidence which would have explained why someone had stopped repaying their debt. Vulnerable: The FCA's own report found evidence that high-risk applicants were still being accepted for loans . 'In many cases, these customers were still being chased for their debts through daily letters, emails and phone calls', the FCA said. Even lenders which had logged details of customers' personal circumstances, including illness or bereavement, sometimes failed to tell debt collectors this. Some firms were also short-staffed and inadequately trained to deal with complex arrears cases, it added. However, it said some positive changes and been made and that most firms had significantly reduced the amount of fees and interest they charged customers who had fallen behind with their repayments. Joanna Elson, at the Money Advice Trust charity, said payday lenders must 'drastically improve the way they treat customers in financial difficulty'. She said: 'While the improvements already being made by firms are welcome, the FCA has been very clear that many are struggling with the pace of change required to bring them up to scratch.' The Financial Ombudsman Service, which resolves disputes when financial firms and consumers cannot come to an agreement, said it has seen vulnerable payday loan customers being treated in an 'alarming' way. The ombudsman has seen a 64 per cent increase in payday lending complaints since 2012 and it is currently taking on more than 70 new cases each month. It is finding in consumers' favour in around two-thirds of cases. The main complaint it deals with is a loan provider being unwilling to accept a suitable repayment plan, as well as poor administration and customer service. Gillian Guy, of Citizens' Advice Bureau, said: 'Some of the worst debt collection practices people tell us about come from payday lenders. 'People have sought our help after their lender told colleagues about their debts or pretended that they were bailiffs and threatened to seize belongings from their home. 'Important progress has been made since tougher FCA rules came in but many people are still falling foul of irresponsible lending. 'Payday loan firms should only lend to people who they know can afford to pay back the debt, and must point those who can't towards free debt advice.'","Lenders still 'bullying' customers suffering from illness and bereavement .

"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to issue a humiliating apology after The Mail on Sunday exposed him for misleading the House of Commons over who will foot the huge compensation bill for victims of Jimmy Savile. In a statement to the House last week, Mr Hunt pledged that Savile’s charities are responsible for paying up to £40 million due. But this newspaper can reveal that the charities are exempt – and that it is the NHS which is liable. The Mail on Sunday has also learnt that a further bill, which may eventually be as large, will be met by BBC licence fee payers. Scroll down for video . Pledge: Jeremy Hunt speaking in the House of Commons last week where he pledged that Jimmy Savile's charities would fit the £40 million bill due to his victims . Last night, in a major climbdown, a Department of Health spokeswoman confirmed that a statement to the House by Mr Hunt on February 26 was inaccurate. ‘He will be writing to the Opposition to correct it,’ she said. She said the NHS had not set aside a ‘specific pot’ of money, but added: ‘We are committed to picking up any claims the estate cannot cover.’ The Savile estate is already effectively bankrupt. Mr Hunt addressed the Commons after the publication of reports which detailed Savile’s abuse of victims at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and elsewhere. He told MPs that a total of £40 million was still ‘under management’ in two charities Savile established and ‘that money will be made available to meet claims made by Savile’s victims’. Mr Hunt added: ‘If it is not enough, the Government will meet any further claims through the NHS Litigation Authority.’ Savile founded the charities, mainly to fund healthcare, they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate, which is already effectively bankrupt . However, although Savile founded the charities, mainly to fund healthcare, they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate. Last year the High Court and the Court of Appeal made clear that they cannot be asked to meet any compensation costs or damages. And yesterday it emerged that neither charity held anything close to £40 million anyway. The Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust had around £1.75 million when it was wound up in 2013, and the accounts to December 2014 show the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust held £3.4 million. Jo Summers, the charities’ solicitor, said: ‘There is no way funds in a charity can be used to pay compensation to victims, as this is not permitted by charity law. The only funds that can be used to pay compensation are the estate funds.’ The BBC has also agreed to pay the legal costs and damages for those abused on its premises. Yesterday a spokesman refused to reveal how much the Corporation had earmarked, saying only: ‘The terms of the scheme were agreed with lawyers for the victims, as well as the NHS and the Savile estate.’ As of November last year, the Savile estate was worth £3.2 million. But almost all of this is certain to be eaten up in fixed payments to lawyers agreed under a ‘fast track’ compensation scheme for which about 200 people have applied. So far just 39 claims have been rejected. As this newspaper reported last year, under the scheme each claim will trigger payments of up to £16,000 to lawyers. Further payments will be made to law firm Osborne Clarke, which runs the scheme on behalf of Savile’s executors, NatWest. The firm had already been paid £500,000 when the scheme was approved by the Court of Appeal in November, and will be due more. In many cases, the damages paid will be less than the legal costs. The Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust had around £1.75 million when it was wound up in 2013, and the accounts to December 2014 show the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust held £3.4 million . But this is not the end of taxpayers’ liability. As well as claiming under the fast track scheme, alleged victims can also sue Savile’s estate directly in the High Court. In last year’s court hearings it emerged that numerous actions are being considered – with damages and costs likely to be higher. However, bedevilling these is a lack of documentary records, and evidence of some false claims by individuals. Ms Summers added: ‘It seems impossible to quantify the potential bill. The number of abuse allegations greatly outweighs the number of claims being brought under the scheme. It could be years before the NHS knows the total cost.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘It is of great concern that Jeremy Hunt could give such misleading information to victims and the Commons on a matter of this significance. He needs to return to the Commons at first opportunity to apologise to victims and correct the record.’","Jeremy Hunt is to issue an apology after misleading House of Commons .

"The cost of building the HS2 railway line is nine times higher than it would be in France, a damning report concludes today. A House of Lords committee says the £50billion project should be stopped in its tracks until ministers can make a stronger case for it. Their report – The Economics of High Speed 2 – says the Government's sums do not add up. They claim ministers have failed to consider an alternative to spending £50billion on one line, asking: 'How much could be achieved if that money were invested differently? Scroll down for video . Criticised: A House of Lords committee has called for the £50billion HS2 project (artist's representation) to be scrapped arguing that ministers have not made a good enough case for its construction . 'The cost per mile of HS2 is estimated to be up to nine times higher than the cost of constructing high speed lines in France.' The report by the economic affairs committee concludes the Government has many questions to answer on cost, benefit, reducing overcrowding and helping the regions. It adds: 'Parliament should not approve the enabling legislation that will allow HS2 work to begin until we have satisfactory answers to these key questions.' The first phase of HS2, from London to Birmingham, is due to open in 2026, with a second Y-shaped phase to Manchester and Leeds due for completion around 2032/33. The report says HS2 is supposed to rebalance the economy but it is London rather than the Midlands or the North that is likely to be the biggest beneficiary. Lord Hollick, chairman of the Lords committee, said: 'At £50billion, HS2 will be one of the most expensive infrastructure projects ever undertaken in the UK but the Government have not yet made a convincing case for why it is necessary. 'The committee are supportive of investment in rail infrastructure, but are not convinced that HS2 as currently proposed is the best way to deliver that investment.' Joe Rukin, of the Stop HS2 Campaign, said: 'This is surely another nail in the coffin of HS2. The case for HS2 has been ripped apart again so thoroughly that cancelling the white elephant is surely now the only option.' Waste of money: The report says HS2 is supposed to rebalance the economy (graphic from 2013) but it is London rather than the Midlands or the North that is likely to be the biggest beneficiary . The report is a serious blow to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin. However the Department for Transport insisted HS2 would deliver more than £2 of benefits for every £1 invested. In a statement, it said: 'The case for HS2 is crystal clear. It will have a transformational effect, supporting growth in the North by improving connectivity, freeing up space on our crowded rail network, promoting regeneration, boosting local skills, generating tens of thousands of jobs and helping secure the UK's future prosperity.' On HS2's ability to relieve congestion, the peers said full information on passenger numbers had not been made available by the Government on grounds of commercial sensitivity. They said the target price for phase one of HS2 gives an average cost of around £90million per kilometre. The French TGV network cost £9.7million a kilometre.","House of Lords committee says ministers have not considered  alternative .

"A widower believes he is being haunted by his dead wife - a year and a half after she died. Ted Wiseman claims his wife of 46 years, Yvonne, is complaining about his bed time habits and the tidiness of the house they shared in Halesowen, West Midlands. The 79-year-old admits that the love-of-his-life, who died at 65 from a stroke in May 2014, had always worn the trousers in their relationship. Ted Wiseman says his late wife has been contacting him from beyond the grave ever since she died last year . Mr Wiseman's wife Yvonne died at 65 from a stroke in May 2014. The couple are pictured on a night out over Christmas in 2012 . Mr Wiseman said his late wife gave him a stern telling off from beyond the grave because he was wearing her slippers (file picture) But in the last year, he says, his wife has been contacting him from beyond the grave - and telling him off for wearing her slippers and sniffing in bed. Mr Wiseman said: 'Yvonne was the gaffer so I'm not surprised she's still bossing me around now. 'Last month I left a tea towel on the side, and when I turned around it had been put back in its rightful place. 'Yvonne was so house-proud that she hated anything being out of place. I was drifting off to sleep the other night when she told me to ""Stop sniffing"". 'She always used to complain about my habits in bed. 'Some people might be upset about being nagged by their wife, but it's quite comforting to me.' Throughout Mrs Wiseman's life she not only controlled her adoring family, but everyone else who came near the house. Mr Wiseman (left) says his late wife Yvonne (right) is complaining about his bed time habits and the tidiness of the house they shared . Mr Wiseman is pictured holding a detergent ball that he says Yvonne put in the washing machine when he had left it out . Mr Wiseman said: 'One day a young lad knocked on our door saying he was being chased and could he come in. 'Yvonne was having none of it and just chased him back down the driveway. 'Although she was strong and forthright, Yvonne was never nasty. I'd often suggest going places or doing something and she'd just chuckle and say ""no"". And that was the end of that. 'I never won those arguments.' During their marriage, Mr Wiseman, a former lollipop man, and Yvonne, a care home worker, had two children and five grandchildren. Son David was with his father when Yvonne first made her presence known from the other side. Mr Wiseman says his late wife has been telling him off for wearing her slippers and sniffing in bed . The pair were sitting in an Indian restaurant when they watched a side dish slowly glide across the table to rest next to Ted. David, 45, said: 'We were waiting for mains and there were dishes all over the table. 'It was perfectly flat, but all of a sudden this one dish moved from one side of the table over next to me. 'I just knew there and then mum was still with us. She was always trying to sort us out, even when we were out and about.' After that meal, Mr Wiseman contacted a medium to help explain the ghostly goings on. During her visit, he said he received a stern telling off from his late wife through the clairvoyant demanding he take her slippers off. Mr Wiseman said he received a stern telling off from his late wife through a clairvoyant - demanding he take her slippers off . Since then, Mr Wiseman claims Yvonne has moved a dirty soap dispenser off the kitchen worktop and even helped with the laundry. He said: 'I had just put a load in the washing machine and had put some condition on the top. 'When I turned around to grab the powder and start the wash, the conditioner had gone. I checked the drawer and it was already in there.' All of Yvonne's visits have made Ted a believer in the afterlife. He said: 'I used to be a sceptic, but not anymore. I'm seeing it almost every week at least. 'It's definitely happening to me through Yvonne.'","Ted Wiseman says he is being contacted by his wife of 46 years, Yvonne .

"Comedian John Oliver couldn’t resist ridiculing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz over the introduction last week of his controversial ‘Race Together’ initiative. Schultz and the coffee chain have faced an avalanche of bad publicity and public derision over a well-intentioned initiative for its baristas to strike up a conversation about race relations in the U.S. with customers. ‘I think it’s pretty clear that no one has said “no” to this guy in 25 years,’ said Oliver as he could hardly contain his glee at the comedic material the announcement has created. Comedian John Oliver couldn’t resist ridiculing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Sunday over the introduction last week of his controversial ‘Race Together’ initiative . Speaking on his HBO show on Sunday, the British comedian said a conversation about race is ‘clearly important but there is a time and a place’ ‘But it is not the length of time it takes to whip up a tiramisu frappuccino,’ he joked. The campaign, announced on Tuesday, has received criticism that the company was using racial tensions to boost its bottom line, as it came in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males. Others questioned how Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks. 'Still let's give Howard Schultz credit for starting a conversation across the racial divide with a white billionaire pitching an idea and any number of African American customers telling him how stupid it was,' said Oliver. One user tweeted: 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train.' ‘Hey how’s that conversation on race going Starbucks? Lots of fun right? What if this could be every morning?’ joked Oliver on his HBO show on Sunday . Another added: '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life 'white man's burden' crisis.' ‘Hey how’s that conversation on race going Starbucks? Lots of fun right? What if this could be every morning?’ joked Oliver. 'Nice try Starbucks. Now you can go back to what you do best – burning coffee and glaring at us for using your bathroom without buying anything.' 'Just stay in your lane!' In the face of the backlash, Starbucks announced over the weekend that baristas will no longer be encouraged to write 'Race Together' on customers' cups. The initiative ended on Sunday, but spokesperson Jim Olson denied that the phase out was a reaction to the push back the chain has received. 'Nothing is changing,' he said. 'It's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned.' In a statement on Sunday, Schultz said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was 'just the catalyst' for a larger conversation . Ridiculed: After the campaign was announced, Twitter users slammed the idea as naive . In a statement on Sunday, Schultz acknowledged the naysayers and skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach. 'While there has been criticism of the initiative - and I know this hasn't been easy for any of you - let me assure you that we didn't expect universal praise,' his statement said. 'The heart of Race Together has always been about humanity: the promise of the American Dream should be available to every person in this country, not just a select few. 'We leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most. We are learning a lot. And will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most.' Schultz said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was 'just the catalyst' for a larger conversation. He also said this part of the campaign was always scheduled to end on Sunday. Starbucks will still hold forum discussions, co-produce special sections in USA TODAY and put more stores in minority communities as part of the Race Together initiative, wrote Schultz. An executive on Starbucks' communications team, Corey duBrowa, even blocked people on Twitter before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign. Questions: Another Twitter user pointed out the lack of diversity in the campaign material . DuBrowa later said in a post on Medium that he felt he was being 'personally attacked in a cascade of negativity' and that he had gotten overwhelmed, but later reactivated the account. Schultz had previously defended the ridiculed  campaign as 'very genuine'. During Starbucks' annual shareholders meeting in Seattle on Wednesday, he said the company was simply trying to use its massive reach for good. 'Some in the media will criticize Starbucks for having a political agenda,' he said. 'Our intentions are pure.' Speaking on CBS This Morning on Thursday, he added: 'This is a highly charged, highly emotional issue, we understand that. 'We've tried to be very thoughtful, very genuine, very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores, potentially, we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference.' He said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company's workers can 'elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day', he will be satisfied. When Good Morning America asked Schultz about some of the scathing criticism on Thursday, Schultz responded: 'Well, you know what I say to that - no good deed goes unpunished.' He has explained that workers do not have to participate in the campaign, and that stores can make customers another drink or cover up cups if they don't like the message. A letter from Howard Schultz to Starbucks Partners regarding Race Together: . Dear partners, . I want to offer my heartfelt thanks to every one of you for your fearless and energetic support of the Race Together initiative. Our objective from the very start of this effort -- dating back to our first open forum in Seattle last December -- was to stimulate conversation, empathy and compassion toward one another, and then to broaden that dialogue beyond just our Starbucks family to the greater American public by using our scale for good. After a historic Annual Shareholders Meeting that focused on diversity and inequality, and an initial push for much-needed national discussion around these difficult topics, it is time for us to take stock of where we are, what we have learned from our efforts so far, and what is next. This phase of the effort -- writing 'Race Together' (or placing stickers) on cups, which was always just the catalyst for a much broader and longer term conversation -- will be completed as originally planned today, March 22. But this initiative is far from over. We have a number of planned Race Together activities in the weeks and months to come: more partner open forums, three more special sections co-produced with USA TODAY over the course of the next year, more open dialogue with police and community leaders in cities across our country, a continued focus on jobs and education for our nation's young people plus our commitment to hire 10,000 opportunity youth over the next three years, expanding our store footprint in urban communities across the country, and new partnerships to foster dialogue and empathy and help bridge the racial and ethnic divides within our society that have existed for so many years. While there has been criticism of the initiative -- and I know this hasn't been easy for any of you -- let me assure you that we didn't expect universal praise. The heart of Race Together has always been about humanity: the promise of the American Dream should be available to every person in this country, not just a select few. We leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most. We are learning a lot. And will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most. I want to thank those of you who took time this week to share what you were seeing, hearing, feeling and thinking as we rolled out Race Together across the country. An issue as tough as racial and ethnic inequality requires risk-taking and tough-minded action. And let me reassure you that our conviction and commitment to the notion of equality and opportunity for all has never been stronger. Take care of yourselves and each other. I am proud to be your partner. With great respect, . Howard .

The members of the Latter-Day Saints Church, from Richfield and Monroe, Utah, were visiting a branch of the church in Hamilton before the March 11 accident, the New Zealand Herald reported. They were travelling in a convoy with other tourists who witnessed the crash when Dr Barnett turned his car onto the road where the Mormon temple is located. Dr Barnett, who is an orthodontist and city council member in Utah, suffered broken ribs and bruises to his head in the incident. His late wife Tammy and he have four children and four grandchildren together. Their son Christopher is helping his father leave New Zealand and arranging transportation of the bodies back to Utah.

"An enormous tyre fire on a farm in Essex has shut down roads and trains, leading to travel chaos this morning as firefighters battle to control the blaze. Residents of the area have been warned to stay indoors with their doors and windows shut if they see smoke, with children and asthmatics in particular danger. The fire started last night at a farm near the Fairglen interchange off the A130, between Wickford and Rayleigh. Blaze: Firefighters at the scene of a tyre fire which broke out last night between Wickford and Rayleigh in Essex . Inferno: Seven fire crews have used water and foam in an effort to extinguish the enormous fire . Eruption: The fire has proved difficult to control because the tyres are packed tightly together and it is hard to get water to the core . Seven fire engines were sent to tackle the blaze, which has proved particularly tricky because the waste tyres are packed closely together making it difficult to extinguish the core of the fire. The A1245 has been closed in both directions because of smoke reducing visibility in the area and this is likely to continue for most of the day, Essex Police said. Greater Anglia train services on the line to London are not running between Southend and Wickford, and are not expected to restart until this afternoon. Inspector Scott Egerton, of Essex Police's roads policing team, said: 'There will be long delays and I would ask people to avoid the area. 'Diversions will be in place but people should check social media and Essex travel updates for the latest information. The transport network in the area could be affected for most of the day.' Flames: Local residents were told not to go outside because of the risk of smoke inhalation and other injuries . Tricky: Firefighters ended up using foam to beat back the flames, but it took longer to get to the fire burning at the core . Action: Crews battled through the night to try and extinguish the fire on a farm . Dramatic: Flames leapt up from the fire through the night and into the morning despite the best efforts of fire crews . Gary Jeffrey of Essex Fire and Rescue Service said that crews remain at the scene attempting to put out the fire. 'It is a large pile of tyres which have been tightly bound together at a waste storage site,' he said early this morning. 'Because the tyres are so densely packed and tightly bound it is proving difficult to get water on to much of the fire.' Firefighters successfully brought the flames under control with foam this morning, but they are still fighting to extinguish it completely. 'The foam attack was successful in knocking the flames back but the fire continues to burn deep within the pile,' Mr Jeffrey said. 'We are now using water to cool the pile and protect surrounding risks. 'We hope to get some heavy plant machinery in to start breaking the pile up later to give us better access to extinguish the fire.' Disruption: Train services in the area were shut down all morning, causing chaos for commuters travelling to London . At work: Firefighters next to the fire as it continued to burn this morning . Closed: The A1245 was shut in both directions as a result of the danger from smoke pouring into the air . Public Health England said in a statement that local residents should 'avoid outside areas affected by any smoke or ash'. It added: 'If people can see smoke outside their property, or can see evidence of soot particles on window sills or external surfaces, then they should stay indoors with windows and doors closed until the fire has been brought under control. 'For anyone who already has problems with their lungs, for example asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, it is advisable to stay inside while the fire is still burning, minimise infiltration of smoke by keeping windows and doors closed and to be sure to keep all necessary medicine with you.' Residents who are suffering from ill health as a result of the fire should seek medical attention.","Fire started last night at a farm just off the A130 between Wickford and Rayleigh, and was still burning this morning .

"Russell Brand has been voted as the world's fourth greatest thinker by readers of intellectual magazine Prospect. The comedian-turned-anarchist has beaten the likes of Nobel peace prize winner Henry Kissinger and Booker prize recipient Hilary Mantel to make it into the top ten list of influential minds. Unveiling its list of world thinkers in its latest edition, Prospect described Brand as 'the spiritual leader of Britain's disaffected anti-capitalist youth'. Russell Brand has been voted as the world's fourth greatest thinker by readers of an intellectual magazine . But the magazine is facing ridicule for including the self-style revolutionary on the list of eminent philosophers, economists and writers. Drayton Bird ‏wrote on Twitter: 'Beyond parody: if this wag is a great thinker, my vote goes to Peppa Pig.' Tim Walker added: 'A generation or so ago, Bertrand Russell was considered to be a great thinker. Now, comically, it's Russell Brand.' Marlowe ‏tweeted: 'Russell Brand great thinker??? They misheard someone say 'little tinker'.' While writer David Oldroyd-Bolt added: 'It's utterly perverse. Russell Brand? Nothing more than a Dickensian demagogue.' Television and radio presenter Brand, who lost his Radio 2 slot over prank calls to actor Andrew Sachs, made his name in stand-up. Brand joined the likes of Hilary Mantel and Henry Kissinger on the 50-strong list of great minds . But the millionaire's attempts to re-brand himself as an anti-capitalist revolutionary have seen him accused of hypocrisy. Last December Simon Cowell  branded him a 'hypocrite' after he accused the comedian of accepting large Hollywood film salaries whilst campaigning against the UK political system. According to the Mirror, the music mogul  told Russell to give up his multi-million pound salary if he is planning to continue his campaigning streak. Brand faced further backlash that month when he joined a protest about rising rents in London even though he lives in a £2million bachelor pad owned by a firm based in a tax haven. The star, believed to be worth £9million, was helping deliver a petition on affordable housing to 10 Downing Street but flew into a rage when TV reporter Paraic O'Brien asked him whether the super-rich buying up property in London was driving up prices for everyone else. Prospect described Brand as 'the spiritual leader of Britain's disaffected anti-capitalist youth' Prospect admitted that Brand's inclusion on the list had caused 'intense' discussions among staff. But the magazine said that while he was often 'dismissed by his opponents as a clownish opportunist and even a hypocrite due to his own wealth, he is nevertheless the most charismatic figure on Britain's populist left.' 1. Thomas Piketty, French economist. 2. Yanis Varoufakis, Greek finance minister. 3. Naomi Klein, US author. 4. Russell Brand, UK comedian and campaigner. 5. Paul Krugman, US economist. 6. Arundhati Roy, Indian writer and activist. 7. Jurgen Habermas, German philosopher. 8. Daniel Kahneman, US-Israeli psychologist. 9. John Gray, UK philosopher. 10. Atul Gawande, US surgeon and writer. This year's winner was French economist Thomas Piketty, whose Capital in the Twenty-First Century book explored the thesis is that capitalist economies have a natural tendency to incubate highly unequal distributions of income and wealth. The surprise best-seller, was described as having an 'extraordinary' impact outside the world of professional economists. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was rated second greatest thinker and US author Naomi Klein came third. Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman and German philosopher Jurgen Habermas were also in the top ten. Rated as ninth was British philosopher John Gray, the former Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics, who was described as 'the West's pre-eminent oracle of catastrophe'. Prospect said it was 'striking' that several of its top 10 thinkers - including Piketty, Brand, Krugman and Varoufakis, a member of the radical Syriza government, as well as US author Naomi Klein - were 'broadly speaking on the political left'.","Comedian Russell Brand is rated the fourth greatest thinker in the world .

"Jason Zadrozny, 34, a Lib Dem election candidate and councillor, has been suspended  after being quizzed over historic child sex allegations . A would-be Liberal Democrat MP has been suspended by the party and withdrawn his candidacy after being questioned by police over historic child sex allegations. Jason Zadrozny, who was due to stand as an MP in the marginal Ashfield seat, was questioned by officers yesterday over allegations relating to the abuse of a 16-year-old boy. Today Mr Zadrozny issued a statement saying he 'vehemently' denies the allegations and was withdrawing from the general election while he fights to clear his name. He said: 'I am today withdrawing my candidacy as a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Ashfield and Eastwood Constituency. 'Yesterday I was questioned by Nottinghamshire Police about historic allegations, some of which are over ten years old. 'I am in full cooperation with the police and vehemently refute the allegations. 'I have spent the last ten years championing the cause of the Liberal Democrats both locally and nationally and I do not want this allegation to detract from the real issues facing local residents in the upcoming elections. 'Therefore I will step down with immediate effect as the party's prospective parliamentary candidate to spend my time clearing my name.' Nottinghamshire police said: 'A man has been bailed following an investigation in historic sexual offences. 'The 34-year-old was arrested yesterday and questioned about an allegation of gross indecency with a male under 16 between September 2003 and April 2004, sexual activity with a child between May 2004 and December 2007 and an allegation of meeting a child under 16 following sexual grooming from May 2004 and December 2007.' Officers said all the offences had been committed against one victim. Mr Zadrozny has been bailed until June. Mr Zadrozny is an experienced Lib Dem campaigner and came within a narrow margin of winning the Ashfield seat at the last general election. Mr Zadrozny (pictured with party leader Nick Clegg) has 'vehemently' denied the allegations, and said he has withdrawn his nomination as MP while he fights to clear his name . According to news reports from the time, Mr Zadrozny secured a swing of 17 per cent from Labour, but was ultimately defeated by a margin of just 192 votes. He lost to TV journalist Gloria De Piero, who had taken over the seat from disgraced former MP Geoff Hoon, who was caught up in the expenses scandal of 2009. Mr Zadrozny, who serves as an Ashfield District and Nottinghamshire County Councillor for Sutton North, was selected to fight the seat back in September 2013. At the time, Simon Hughes, deputy of the Liberal Democrats, said there was 'nobody better' to fight for the Ashfield seat. This evening Mr Zadrozny's Twitter feed had been deactivated, and his profile page on the Lib Dem's website deactivated. A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'We have been made aware of a police investigation in Ashfield. The party has immediately suspended the party's parliamentary candidate pending the outcome of a police investigation. 'We are unable to make any further comment at this stage.' Mr Zadrozny's suspension is just the latest blow to hit political parties in the rundown to May's hotly-contested general election. Mr Zadronzy's suspension is just the latest blow for the major parties heading into this May's general election. Tory MP Aidan Burley, who represented Cannock Chase, stood down today after a series of scandals . Ukip MEP and parliamentary hopeful Janice Atkinson was expelled from Ukip earlier this week after claims her assistant was filmed trying to cheat expenses . Earlier this week Ukip expelled one of its most prominent MEPs, and general election candidate for Folkestone and Hythe, after she was allegedly caught fiddling expenses. Janice Atkinson and her assistant Christine Hewitt were kicked out of the party after Ms Hewitt was reportedly filmed trying to claim £3,150 for a drinks party that actually cost £950. Just a day later Tim Wilson, who was due to stand for MP in South Northamptonshire, quit the party, saying leader Nigel Farage had failed to condemn another of his MEPs who compared a Muslim politician to terrorist Abu Hamza. Earlier today a Tory MP mired in scandal also quit parliament after just five years, departing with a whinging speech about not being paid enough, and a swipe at 'rude' constituents. Aidan Burley, who represented Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, was once caught being the best man at a Nazi-themed stag do, and also described the Olympic opening ceremony as 'leftie multicultural crap'.

'Since early morning, I have devoted all my hours and energy to honoring your good husband in the manner he would most approve. I have sought — by word, deed and official act — to unite this sorrowing and troubled nation against further and wider violence.

Fraser had been living in the Southern California desert community of Temecula, where he died Monday, the Riverside County coroner said in a statement. The cause of death is  under investigation, but it was known that he had been battling HIV and cancer. He was reportedly found in his car by his gardener. Andy Fraser, who co-wrote the rousing rock anthem All Right Now when he was the teenage bassist for the British rock band Free, has died in California at age 62 . At age 15, the London-born Fraser briefly became a member of John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. The group functioned as a training ground for young British rockers including Eric Clapton and Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor. Within a year, Fraser became a founding member of Free. The band's most prominent member was singer and guitarist Paul Rodgers, who would also go on to front Bad Company and The Firm. The band's biggest hit by far was 1970's 'All Right Now,' which remains one of the defining hits of classic rock radio. Fraser also produced the track and plays a bass solo on it. Fraser kept playing music for most of his life, but he would never equal the success he had as a teen with Free, which broke up in 1972 .

"Despite insisting that her full lips are natural, Kylie Jenner has sparked a huge craze for lip fillers and young women across the globe are attempting to recreate her look. Last week, a swimwear model told how a DIY lip job ended in disaster when she tried to emulate the super pout of reality star Kylie Jenner by sucking into a hairspray lid. And now, a pair of sisters have found themselves in a similar situation after they sucked into a bottle in an attempt to achieve the look. Scroll down for video . Two sisters, including Bir­gitta Ás, pictured, were left with swollen and blue lips after sucking into a bottle to try and give themselves a fuller pout. They posted pictures of the results on Facebook to warn other girls against trying the beauty trick . Yrja Ás Baldvinsdottir, 18, and her sister, Bir­gitta Ás, from the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, were left with swollen and blue bruised lips after testing the trick at home. Writing on Facebook, Yrja As said: 'I wanted to warn people against do-it-yourself lip expansion, but was really surprised and shocked that it ended up being something that loads of people were copying.' Speaking about the method, which involves sucking into the lid of a bottle, she said: 'I just wanted to try it and see what they would look like, I've never done it before, and I won't be doing it again. It was very, very painful. My lips turned blue. 'But af­ter we put our photo on the pop­u­lar Beau­tyTips Face­book page we've seen a num­ber of girls copy­ing us.' Yrja Ás Baldvinsdottir, left, and her sister  wrote on a Facebook group to warn others against trying the trend for sucking into a bottle . Cosmetic surgeon Pordiis Kjartansdottir said she had never heard of the DIY method before, but warned against it. 'I can definitely say that this would be dangerous even just to try it, and especially if somebody does it more than once,' she said. 'The lips turned blue because blood fills up and they could easily become infected and lose all sensation. It is a really dangerous stunt and I'd advise strongly against anybody trying it.'

"Claire Allnutt died in hospital after a dirty drip was left in her arm for four days. Her family are now taking action against the NHS trust involved, which, they claim, only gave staff 20 minutes training in a new system of patient monitoring . Medics who treated a young woman who died after a dirty drip was left in her arm for four days had just 20 minutes training in a monitoring system, it has been claimed. Claire Allnutt was recovering from having the flesh-eating bug necrotising fasciitis at Luton and Dunstable Hospital last year when the contaminated catheter was used to administer antibiotics. Her devastated parents, Ann and Richard, are now taking action against the NHS trust involved and are claiming staff may have had just 20 minutes training on a new system of monitoring patients. Ms Alnutt's family have also reported five medics from the hospital to the, the General Medical Council watchdog, claiming a catalogue of errors led to their daughter's death. Claire, 28, has been suffering from the flesh-eating infection but was making a full recovery after two months in hospital. But she died from septicaemia when a drip administering antibiotics was left in her arm for four days, triggering blood poisoning. It later emerged that the hospital was using a new electronic alert system called National Early Warning Score. It showed that Claire's condition was deteriorating but staff appear not to have acted on the alert. Her family lodged Freedom of Information request and found staff may have only had 20 minutes training on the system. They have instructed lawyers specialising in medical negligence cases to take action against the hospital. Carole Watts of firm Ashton KCJ said: 'On the face of it this seems to be a very short period of training, especially as the electronic warning system deals with life and death situations. 'It's of great concern to Claire's parents that the staff using the electronic system may not have been adequately trained to use it. 'They are devastated by the loss of their daughter and it's important for them to know that lessons have been learnt from their tragic loss.' An inquest last year heard how a junior doctor spotted fungal spores in the tube on a Friday but it wasn't removed until the following Tuesday. Observation notes showed Claire's condition worsened over the weekend but medics decided to just monitor her and no action was taken until the Tuesday. By that time, life-threatening sepsis had set in and she suffered several heart attacks before dying in the early hours of the following morning. Claire, from Luton, Bedforshire, who was obese and had learning difficulties, had initially refused to consent to the tube being withdrawn because of a phobia of needles. Ms Allnutt's family have also reported five members of staff at the hospital to the General Medical Council . Her family have questioned why no action was taken to remove the drip, known as a PICC line. Ms Watts added: 'The family have many questions about the circumstances of Claire's death and why no action was taken to remove the PICC line. 'It's hoped that the GMC complaint will ensure the actions of the doctors around the time of Claire's death are fully investigated and that the family are given the answers that they need. 'Claire's parents are determined to fight for justice for Claire and a civil claim is being pursued against the hospital.' A hospital spokesman said: 'The Luton and Dunstable University Hospital has given an unreserved apology to Claire Allnutt's family following her tragic death last January. 'All staff groups involved in Claire's case have reflected and learned from the events that occurred prior to Claire's death, and this has resulted in a number of changes to practice, which are being constantly monitored and evaluated.' Hospital bosses say they have apologised unreservedly to Ms Allnutt's family and have made changes .","Patient was recovering well from flesh-eating bug in Luton hospital .

A remote Scottish community have voted overwhelmingly to buy the island once owned by the laird. On Thursday night the result of a postal ballot was revealed on Gear Bernera in the Western Isles - home to around 250 people and linked to the Isle of Lewis by bridge. In total 85 per cent of the community turned voted with 142 saying yes to buying the island and just 37 against the move.

"A judge has ended Chris Brown's felony probation in an assault case over his 2009 attack on pop singer Rihanna. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James R Brandlin said Friday that the R&B singer had completed the terms of his sentence, which included community labor, domestic violence counseling and rehab. The relief was palpable on the face of the singer, who turned up in court with purple hair wearing a suit jacket over a t-shirt. Scroll down for video . Free man: Chris Brown's relief is palpable on Friday as a Los Angeles court judge finally releases him from probation stemming from his 2009 assault on then-girlfriend Rihanna . Brown has been subject to scrutiny by court and probation officials after pleading guilty to attacking Rihanna, his girlfriend at the time, hours before the 2009 Grammy Awards. The attack destroyed Brown's squeaky clean image and he has in recent years struggled to end the case. Brown spent two-and-a-half months in jail after he was arrested for hitting a man outside a Washington hotel in October 2013. Rihanna and Brown rekindled their relationship after a restraining order in the case was lifted, but have since broken up. Satisfied: Superior Court Judge James R Brandlin decreed the 25-year-old had completed the terms of his sentence, which included community labor, domestic violence counseling and rehab . Casual: The singer arrived in court with purple hair, wearing a suit jacket but skipping the shirt or tie . On again: Brown and Rihanna, seen here at the 2013 Grammys, had rekindled their relationship for a time despite the assault four years earlier that left her face battered and cut . The judge's decision came as a surprise to many, who believed he was actually going to revoke Brown's probation and throw him back in jail after a damning report by the probation department. TMZ had reported right before the hearing that his probation officer had pulled a u-turn and was supplying the court with a favourable report, claiming that it was 'all but certain' his the judge would  reinstated. But Brown's full release seemed to catch everybody off guard. His probation had been revoked in January after officials cited a number of red flags he had recently raised. While he wasn't a suspect in either, Brown was present at two recent shooting incidents; One in San Jose, the other in Hollywood in which rap mogul Suge Knight was shot. Shock: The decision came as a surprise to many, who expected at the very least that the singer's probation would be reinstated . Turnabout: Some analysts expected Brown would actually be imprisoned for his probation violations . In the most recent incident, Brown was actually performing on stage at a nightclub in the early hours of January 11 when a number of shots were fired, causing widespread panic. Five people were wounded, but the singer escaped uninjured. His appearance in San Jose was in itself a violation of his probation, since he is supposed to get permission before he leaves LA County. The second shooting indecent occurred at 10AK nightclub in August at a pre-MTV Video Music Awards party hosted by Brown, where three people were shot and wounded, including Knight, who himself is currently being held on murder charges for an unrelated incident. Scott free: Although he wasn't implicated in either, Brown was present at two recent shooting incidents in California . Why me?: The singer was performing on stage in San Jose - having left the country without permission from his probation officer - when five people were shot, while Suge Knight was also shot at a separate party he hosted . WWJD?: Brown asked and then thanked God on Twitter for his escape . Although Brown was never implicated in either shooting, his probation report notes that 'There is also concern that when he performs or attends at some of his public events, people will get shot or seriously injured'. The musician's probation had been revoked on a number of previous occasions. In July 2013 he was involved in a hit-and-run in Los Angeles, but the charges were dropped before he found out if he would have to go to jail under the terms of his probation. Red flags: The musician, seen here performing this week at the Hampton Colliseum in Virginia, has had his probation revoked several of times for a number of different incidents . Brown, seen here remanded in custody while he awaited to hear his fate following his assault on a man outside a hotel in Washington, which reportedly occurred when a photobombing incident spiraled out of hand . In October of that year he was involved in a fight with two men outside the W Hotel in Washington and his parole was again revoked, but again he escaped a prison sentence when the judge ruled his progress in anger management classes was enough to offset it. But when he was kicked out of rehab - another violation of his probation rules - he was finally sent to jail in March of last year, but released early in June due to prison overcrowding . KTLA reporter Christina Pacucci, who was outside the courtroom, tweeted 'I asked @chrisrown how it feels to be done. He said with a huge smile- ""two thumbs up"". Having tweeted earlier in the day 'Hopefully this is my last day in court... pray for me', Brown then tweeted: 'IM OFF PROBATION!!!!!!!! Thank the Lord!!!!!!' Battered: Rihanna in 2009, waiting to hear if her former boyfriend Brown would stand trial for assaulting her .","Brown physically assaulted then-girlfriend Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 Grammy Awards, leaving her hospitalised .

"Oscar Wilde may have said ‘I can resist everything except temptation,' but he didn't have a smart safe to help him. The cylindrical device, called kSafe, keeps various forms of temptation locked away - whether it is fattening cookies, cigarettes or a time-consuming games controller. And the only way to unlock it is to reach pre-determined fitness goals, such as walking a set number of steps in a day. Scroll down for video . No more temptation: The cylindrical device, called kSafe, locks up a form of temptation - whether it is fattening cookies, cigarettes or a time-consuming games controller (pictured) The San Diego-based start-up behind the device said on its Kickstarter site: ‘kSafe is part of a research proven system that turns temptation into motivation, so you always achieve your goals.’ Users place an object of temptation into the safe and then set a goal using the accompanying app. There are three types of goals to choose from including activity goals, location goals and time goals. For example, for an activity goal, users could set the safe to unlock once they have taken a certain number of steps or burned enough calories, while a location goal may help motivate students. Strict: The only way to unlock the kSafe is to reach pre-determined fitness goals, such as walking a set number of steps in a day, which can be set and tracked on an app (pictured left and right) Users will place temptation into the kSafe, whether that is a bar of chocolate or iPad, for example. They will then set a goal using the smartphone app and lock the kSafe. There are three different types of choose from and the level of difficulty can be set - but not lessened once the safe has been locked. The kSafe will only unlock once a user has reached their goal. Users will be able to follow their progress on a light-up button and app. ‘Set kSafe to only unlock once you've arrived and checked-in to a location, like a gym or library,' the company said. The safe will be able to be instructed to open on certain days or at certain times, which the firm added can be used to break bad habits, such as snacking between meal times. It claimed the safe ‘crams years of willpower and behavioural research from MIT, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Princeton in to a fun, effective, and easy to use product.’ It uses pre-commitment, an example of which is moving an alarm clock out of reach so the user can’t reach the snooze button, to make people commit to a smart choice, knowing that they'll probably be tempted later. The device also capitalises on the idea of reward substitution, much like at school when a person may have worked hard on homework to earn going to a party. ‘Even though making your boss happy or acing a test has more long term benefits, it's wanting that beer with our friends that motivates us to finish,' the company wrote. Motivational: Users will be able to view their progress in meeting their goal on the light-up ‘button dial’ on the top of the kSafe (pictured) or via the app . Compact: The safe can also be used in a conventional way using a password code to keep items safe, or off-limits to children, for example. This diagram shows its dimensions . ‘Both of these concepts have been thoroughly researched and tested and they are consistently shown to improve our chances of reaching our goals.' Users will be able to view their progress in meeting their goal on the light-up ‘button dial’ on the top of the safe or via the app. When they achieve their goal, the safe will pop open. The company said: ‘kSafe won’t open until you’ve reached your goal. No overrides!’ The safe could also be used in a conventional way using a password code to keep items safe or off-limits to children, for example. As well as allowing users to check their progress, the app will let them raise the bar if they are feeling particularly motivated to burn extra calories or study into the night. But it won’t let users get away with making their challenge easier. The device is available in three colours: black, white and transparent, and can be pre-ordered via Kickstarter for $89 (£60) with an estimated delivery date of November.","kSafe locks up a form of temptation such as cookies or a games controller .

"A 59-year-old man has been arrested for the murder of Claudia Lawrence six years after she vanished. The married father-of-two drank in the same pub as the missing university chef and lives within half a mile of her home in York. The development came days after police released CCTV of a mystery man caught on camera walking towards the back of her terraced house on the evening she was last known to be alive. Officers have been working on a ‘significant’ new line of inquiry focusing on the alleyway behind her home and yesterday’s arrest is believed to be linked to that investigation. Scroll down for video . A 59-year-old man has been arrested for the murder of Claudia Lawrence (pictured) six years after she vanished . North Yorkshire Police have asked media not to identify the suspect for fear of compromising the inquiry at what they describe as a ‘critical phase’. The man was arrested on Monday morning and police moved into his semi-detached house to carry out detailed searches and forensic inquiries. Neighbours in the quiet cul-de-sac in a middle-class neighbourhood were surprised by the police activity. One said: ‘I know him, I’ve lived here for 20 years and he’s just a normal bloke. He’s lived here longer than me.’ The neighbour said he had recently lost his job working as a manager for a large firm. Police moved into the suspect's semi-detached house to carry out detailed searches and forensic inquiries . It came days after police released new CCTV footage which shows two people walking near her home on the evening she vanished. It is understood the arrest is linked to this appeal . Miss Lawrence, 35, returned home from work on Wednesday, March 18, 2009, and spoke to her parents separately on the phone that evening. She has not been seen since. Her father reported her missing on the Friday. Despite a huge investigation police have failed to find a single clue to explain what has happened to her. The suspect being questioned was one of many men who were spoken to at the time of the original police inquiry because he drank in the same pub as Miss Lawrence. The landlady of a different local pub, who also knows the suspect, said yesterday: ‘He said the police spoke to him at the time, but he always made light of it. He said the police went to his house. He is a really funny, really nice guy who reads loads of books. He was very witty.’ Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, who is leading the new police investigation, said no further details about the arrest would be released. He said: ‘I urge everyone to show restraint and patience while we carry out these very important inquiries.’ Police told Miss Lawrence’s parents Peter and Joan about the arrest shortly before making the news public. Detectives said they have not found Claudia's body, who vanished on Thursday 19 March 2009 . Yesterday Mr Lawrence, 68, a solicitor, said: ‘Any progress is good. It is encouraging to know that following all the media activity over the last three weeks…police continue to be active in seeking answers as to what has happened to Claudia. It is to be hoped the matter can be resolved as soon as possible and I encourage people to continue to come forward with information to the police.’ Jen King, one of Miss Lawrence’s closest friends, said: ‘Everyone wants closure, but they have already arrested two people and got nowhere.’ A 60-year-old man was arrested last year on suspicion of murder but was later released without charge. A 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Mr Malyn took charge of the inquiry in 2013 and looked at all the evidence with a ‘fresh eye’. Since then police have carried out new forensic inquiries inside Miss Lawrence’s house – finding fingerprints of people they have not yet identified. Last month the inquiry took a twist when police carried out a detailed search of an alleyway behind Miss Lawrence’s home. Mr Malyn said at the time his detectives were unravelling ‘lies and relationships’ in the missing woman’s life. Last week police released CCTV footage taken at around 7.15pm on March 18 showing a man walking towards the rear of Miss Lawrence’s house. The camera picks him up returning about one minute later and he appears to be carrying a bag over his shoulder. As he walks back to the main road he is seen to stop briefly as another man walks in front of him. Police appealed for information to identify both men and the arrest came five days later. Anyone with information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or www.crimestoppers-uk.org . The footage shows an area near an alleyway at the rear of Miss Lawrence's terraced house, which was searched by police last month and is said to be of 'growing significance' to the investigation .

"They are some of the richest habitats on the planet yet also the hardest for humans to inhabit. Now scientists have discovered that humans may have first begun living in the rainforest around 20,000 years ago - 12,000 years earlier than was thought. Researchers at Oxford University found the evidence trapped inside human teeth discovered in the rainforests of Sabaragamuwa in southern Sri Lanka. Scientists have discovered that humans may have first begun living in the rainforest around 20,000 years ago - 12,000 years earlier than was thought. Researchers at Oxford University found the evidence trapped inside human teeth discovered in the rainforests of Sabaragamuwa in southern Sri Lanka (pictured) They say isotopes in the teeth suggest the people they belonged to had a diet mainly composed of food foraged from the forest. The study also notes that there are hints that humans may even have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago. Neanderthals may have created and worn the world's first jewellery 130,000 years ago, according to scientists. Researchers examining eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Krapina in Croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet. The claws bear multiple cut marks, notches and signs that they had been polishing by the Neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found. Anthropologists at the University Kansas say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in Europe. The findings add to mounting evidence that Neanderthals were not the slow-witted and primative creatures they are often portrayed as. The findings contradict the idea that tropical rainforests were largely human-free environments until around 8,000 years ago. Professor Julia Lee-Thorp, an archaeologist at Oxford University who helped lead the study, said: 'The isotopic methodology applied in our study has already been successfully used to study how primates, including African great apes, adapt to their forest environment. 'However, this is the first time scientists have investigated ancient human fossils in a tropical forest context to see how our earliest ancestors survived in such a habitat.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Science, studied the fossilised teeth of 26 humans of a range of dates - from 20,000 to 3,000 years ago - found around Sri Lanka. The areas where they were excavated from are all now dense rainforest but it was not clear what the landscape was like when the people were alive. By examining the carbon and oxygen isotopes in the teeth, the researchers were able to see that the humans had a diet that matched those of people living in slightly open 'intermediate rainforest' environments. The study also notes that there are hints that humans may even have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago. Rainforests, like in Sri Lankan above, may teem with life but beneath the trees life can be hard for humans. The findings contradict the idea that such rainforests were largely human-free until 8,000 years ago . The teeth were found in rainforests  in southern Sri Lanka including in the Batadombealena cave (marked) Patrick Roberts, an archaeology student at Oxford University and lead author of the study, said: 'This is the first study to directly test how much early human forest foragers depended on the rainforest for their diet. 'The results are significant in showing that early humans in Sri Lanka were able to live almost entirely on food found in the rainforest without the need to move into other environments. 'Our earliest human ancestors were clearly able to successfully adapt to different extreme environments.' Professor Mike Petraglia, who also took part in the study at Oxford University, added: 'Our research provides a clear timeline showing the deep level of interaction that early humans had with the rainforest in South Asia. 'We need further research to see if this pattern was also followed in other similar environments in Southeast Asia, Melanesia, Australasia and Africa.' This tooth, also found at the Batadombealena cave in Sri Lanka may be even older than the ones in the study . Analysis of teeth found at Batadombalena in Sri Lanka show the people that lived her survived in the rainforest .","Scientists at Oxford University analysed isotopes in ancient human teeth .

"Furious MPs are in revolt over a decision to sell off the House of Commons silver – to save a ‘paltry’ £200 a week. Some of the silver-plated cutlery used in Commons dining rooms could be sold to tourists as souvenirs and replaced by stainless steel knives and forks made in Vietnam. A leaked report obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveals a plan to strip the new cutlery of the traditional Commons portcullis logo to deter visitors from stealing them. Faded: The silver cutlery used in the dining rooms at the House of Commons . A report accepted by the Commons Administration Committee says the move will save nearly £50,000 over the next five years – £10,000 a year or just under £200 a week. But Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is leading a battle to get the decision overturned, said: ‘Selling off Westminster’s family silver to save a paltry £10,000 a year is taking cheeseparing to ridiculous lengths. ‘There is a fundamental triviality about trying to save this sort of money when we are told we need to find £3 billion to restore the Palace. ‘Dignitaries who come here rightly expect to use silver-plated cutlery – not something one stop short of plastic forks and polystyrene cups.’ Commons catering chiefs claim it costs too much to maintain silver cutlery and insist a new £17,000 stainless steel set – made in Vietnam or Taiwan – will not ‘compromise on class or elegance’. In a report they told MPs: ‘Our silver cutlery must be sent back to the manufacturer for refurbishment annually and burnished weekly (rubbed and cleaned) to maintain its finish. This process is costly, labour intensive and it is becoming more difficult to maintain the cutlery to an acceptable standard.’ The officials say it would cost £72,400 over five years to keep the silver cutlery, including: . Fighting cause: Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg is leading a battle to get the cutlery decision overturned . By contrast, a new stainless steel set will cost £17,000 to buy and £6,800 to replace items that go missing. When the £880 profit from selling off a few worn pieces of silver cutlery for scrap is accounted for, it produces a saving of about £47,000. But that does not include the potential profit from selling some of the silver cutlery through Commons gifts shops, which officials are looking at. The report says ‘the best’ of the silver cutlery will be kept for ‘MP dining clubs, a Member’s wedding breakfast etc’. MPs on the committee voted to keep the portcullis logo and have asked catering chiefs to look at buying cutlery made in the UK.","Leaked report reveals plan to strip the new cutlery of Commons logo .

"A family that has worked the same hillside farm for five generations was yesterday forced to hand over their land to an ‘aggressive’ loan company. Mary and Alun Williams, who produce beef and lamb for supermarkets, say their lives have been destroyed after they were tied to crippling interest rates that dragged them into millions of pounds of debt. Llangefni County Court yesterday ruled they would have to hand over the 600-acre Rhyngddwyafon Farm in Snowdonia National Park, North Wales, which the family has farmed for a century. Mary and Alun Williams (pictured), who produce beef and lamb for supermarkets at their 600-acre farm in Snowdonia National Park, North Wales, have ordered by a court to hand over their land to a loan company . Mary Williams, 55, (pictured outside Llangefni County Court following the ruling) said it was 'the worst day of our lives' and claimed the couple had been 'duped by a firm that is asset-stripping farmers of their livelihoods' Last night Mrs Williams, 55, said: ‘It has been absolutely heartbreaking, the worst day of our lives. We have been totally duped by a firm that is asset-stripping farmers of their livelihoods. ‘My family and especially my sons, Iwan and Rhodri, who farm the land, face an uncertain future. I think the fact nothing has been done to stop this company is a national disgrace. ‘I can’t believed we were so stupid as to believe them and trust them.’ The Williams family say they were advised about four years ago to take a short-term commercial bridging loan to cover their mortgage – starting at rates of up to 22 per cent with the understanding a domestic mortgage rate of around 4 per cent would follow. As it did not materialise they took out further bridging loans and saw their £1.24million loan rocket to £3.1million due to fees, interest and other charges. When they were unable to pay, the firm – Somerset-based UK Acorn Finance – started legal action to repossess the farm. Farmers across the UK are being driven to the wall by lenders using lax regulation to seize properties and livelihoods, say MPs, who accused Acorn of ‘reckless, if not fraudulent’ practice. The couple initially took out a short-term commercial bridging loan to cover their mortgage four years ago but saw the amount they had to pay back soar to £3.1million due to additional loans, fees, interest and charges . The family has farmed on the 600-acre estate in North Wales for the last century. Pictured: Three generations of Williams in 1995:  Iwan, the son of Alun (left), with his father Alun (centre), who is the son Robert (right) Dismissing Mrs Williams’ application for permission to appeal against the forfeiture of the farm, Mr Justice Guy Newey said: ‘I haven’t been persuaded an appeal would have a real prospect of success. 'I appreciate the thoroughly unenviable position Mrs Williams and her family find themselves and I very much sympathise with them.’ As commercial lending is unregulated, most of Acorn’s activities are not overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority. Elfyn Llwyd, a Plaid Cymru MP and barrister, said Acorn and associated companies had exploited farmers for more than two decades in what he called ‘one of the worst scandals’ he had seen. Dozens of farmers have complained to Avon and Somerset Police, saying they were victims of an organised sting with conspiring lenders, brokers and solicitors. Mrs Williams (pictured right on the farm in 2007) said: 'I can’t believed we were so stupid as to believe and trust them' after being dragged into debt by the loans. Pictured left: Her husband Alun working on the farm in 1986 . The couple said their lives have been destroyed by the crippling interest rates that dragged them into  debt . In response to complaints it had not tackled Acorn, the force said it accepted the lender was ‘aggressive and unpleasant’ and had caused significant distress. It said the firm exploits a ‘loophole’ and called for tighter regulation. Now the Financial Conduct Authority, the Solicitors Regulation Authority and the Government are scrutinising Acorn’s activities. Outside court, the firm said: ‘UK Acorn Finance has repeatedly invited Mrs Williams to enter into a constructive dialogue with it to achieve the repayment of her loans but Mrs Williams has chosen not to take up those invitations. 'That has left UK Acorn Finance with no option other than the enforcement of its loan security.’","Mary and Alun Williams forced to hand over their beloved farm to loan firm .

"Mathematics is probably not a subject that many people find sexy, but it could hold the key to finding true love. Mathematicians have developed a series of theories that can help people find the perfect partner. These include tips such as not trying to hide the less attractive parts of your appearance in your online dating profile pictures and looking for people who had fewer colds as a child. Scroll down for video . Dr Hannah Fry's (pictured left) book (right) explains how maths underpins love. She said the Discreet Choice Theory dictates that if there are two women - A and B - who men rank as equally attractive, if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman A, then woman A becomes more popular . They have also proposed mathematical approaches to finding the perfect wife or husband - by not choosing to settle down until after the age of 22 years old. Dr Hannah Fry, a lecturer at University College London and author of a new book on The Mathematics of Love, outlined the theories at the Oxford Literary Festival. She said that choosing friends who are slightly less attractive than you when going out looking for love could also bring advantages. This is known as the Discreet Choice Theory, where the presence of an irrelevant alternative can change how you view your choices. In her book, Dr Hannah Fry suggest a number of techniques to help people find true love. Have friends who are less attractive than you: Known as Discreet Choice Theory, the idea is that if there are two women - A and B - who men rank as being equally attractive, if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman A, then woman A becomes more popular with the men. Highlight your flaws:  Analysis from dating websites has shown that often it is not those who are rated the 'most attractive' who get the most responses from other users. Instead it appears to be those that divide opinion - so those that have something that sets them apart from the rest of the crowds. Men with bald heads, for example, should not wear a hat to cover their pate as their lack of hair will be attractive to some. Those who are overweight should also not use clever photo cropping to hide what they perceive as flaws. This means people who find these traits attractive will face less competition than messaging those who have 'perfect' profile pictures. This formula produced by psychologist John Gottmann and mathematician James Murray predicts how positive or negative a wife and husband will be when they respond in the next turn of a conversation. The most successful couples are those that allow each other to complain and don't let trivial problems build up . Choose 'healthy' looking partners: Dr Fry also explained that looking for those who tend to be heathlier are also likely to be more attractive. Don't settle down until 37% of your 'dating period' has past: The Optimal Stopping Period theory dictates that people should only start looking for the partner they want to settle down with after 37 per cent of their 'dating period' has past. If, for example, they are looking to get married by the age of 35 years old, and start dating from the age of 15, they should discount all partners they have before the age of 22.4 years old. After this time has past, marry the first 'best' partner you get: After the 37 per cent period has past, Dr Fry said people should marry the first partner they find that is better than any that came before. While this might sound like a risky strategy - for example if all subsequent partners fail to live up to the dream match in their teenage years - it is actually used in nature by some species of fish when mating. And if married, follow the 'positive' formula: This formula, devised by psychologist John Gottmann and mathematician James Murray predicts how positive or negative a wife and husband will be when they respond in the next turn of a conversation. The most successful couples are those that allow each other to complain and don't let trivial problems build up. The idea is that if there are two women - A and B - who men rank as being equally attractive, if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman A, then woman A becomes more popular with the men. Dr Fry said: 'If you are trying to choose a wingman or wingwoman, choose someone as similar to you as possible, just slightly less attractive.' Other mathematicians have dedicated a fair amount of time to the subject of finding and keeping love. One mathematician - Peter Backus who was a pHD student at Warwick University at the time - wrote a paper called 'Why I don't have a girlfriend' after a three-year love drought. He calculated - using an mathematical formula known as the Drake equation - that of all the available women in the UK, there were just 26 who were appropriate for him. He also predicted that he had just a one in 285,000 chance of meeting one of them on a night out. Video courtesy of TED - watch the full video here . Being unconventionally attractive may also be an advantage, according to the mathematician's research. This is because it reduces competition for people who find those flaws appealing. Sarah Jessica Parker (shown) divides opinion with many people thinking she's beautiful and others disagreeing . Fortunately for him, it seems he did meet one of them - a girl called Rose from London who he met at a dinner with friends while he was working at Warwick University - and has now married her. According to Dr Fry, however, there are ways of increasing your chances of meeting the one. In her book she provides a series of mathematically supported tips for those looking to find love and keep it. It is the perfect invention for an angst-ridden teenager or a suspicious spouse - scientists have paved the way for a test that can tell if someone is truly in love. Neurologists claim to have discovered the secrets of how different emotions affect the brain. By poring over scans of people in different stages of romance, they think they have the first clues as to what true love looks like. Initial results show a dozen different areas of the brain is affected in different ways by the emotions of love. A cocktail of chemicals carry messages from one region to another, which may allow scientists in the future to use MRI scans to tell what someone truly feels. Early results published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience reveal that the team are already confident they have discovered the part of the brain - the caudate nucleus - which is most active at the end of a love affair.‘ . If the other parts of the puzzle can be pieced together, they may one day be able to tell exactly how someone feels with a brief scan. Analysis from dating websites has shown that often it is not those who are rated the 'most attractive' who get the most responses from other users. Instead it appears to be those that divide opinion - so those that have something that sets them apart from the rest of the crowds. Men with bald heads, for example, should not wear a hat to cover their pate as their lack of hair will be attractive to some. Those who are overweight should also not use clever photo cropping to hide what they perceive as flaws. She explained that this is because often people who find these traits attractive will also be more likely to message as they know it is not attractive to everyone. This means they will face less competition than messaging those who have 'perfect' profile pictures. Dr Fry said: 'People who are unbelievably good looking will always do well, but the rest of us would be better to divide opinion.' She also outlined a maths based strategy for finding a wife or husband known as the Optimal Stopping Period. This states that people should only start looking for the partner you want to settle down with after 37 per cent of their 'dating period' has passed. If, for example, a oerson is looking to get married by the age of 35 years old, and starts dating from the age of 15, they should discount all partners they have before the age of 22.4 years old. Meanwhile, the Optimal Stopping Period theory says people should only start looking for the partner they want to settle down with after 37% of their 'dating period' has past. If, for example, they want to get married by the age of 35, and start dating at 15, they should discount all partners before the age of 22.4 years old . Neurologists recently claimed to have discovered the secrets of how different emotions affect the brain. By poring over scans of people in different stages of romance, they claim to have the first clues as to what true love looks like. The areas affected by the feeling of love are highlight . After this age they should then marry the first partner they find that is better than any that came before. While this might sound like a risky strategy - like if all subsequent partners fail to live up to your dream match in your teenage years - it is actually used in nature by some species of fish when mating. Dr Fry also explained that looking for those who tend to be heathlier are also likely to be more attractive. According to The Times, she said: 'As a child, every time you get a cough or a cold your face tends to grow in a slightly asymmetrical way. 'So in thinking symmetrical faces are more attractive, you are validating an underlying bill of health.' However, recent research has suggested that facial symmetry has little to do with health during childhood but more perhaps a signal of genetic 'fitness'. And for those who are already married, maths can also be used to help predict whether their relationship will last by looking for patterns. Psychologist John Gottmann and mathematician James Murray produced a formula that looks at the mood of each partner when alone, together and how they influence each other. This found that some couples often got into spirals of negativity that would ultimately lead to divorce. The most successful couples are those that allow each other room to complain and do not store up trivial things to become a bit deal. The same formula has also been used to help predict the outcomes of an arms race between countries. Speaking during a Ted Talk last year, Dr Fry said: 'Love, as with most of life, is full of patterns and mathematics is about studying patterns.'","Dr Hannah Fry claims maths holds the secret to having the perfect love life .

"Russian smugglers came up with an original way to bring cigarettes into the West by hiding thousands of them inside hollowed out tree trunks. The cigarettes had been manufactured in Belarus and were heading to the address of a private company in Poland from where they were supposed to be shipped on to Germany and the UK. But they were stopped by the Ukrainian custom officers at the Yagodyn checkpoint located on the Ukrainian side of Ukrainian-Polish border. Ukrainian customs officials remove hundreds of packet of cigarettes which Russian smugglers tried to sneak across the border into Poland in hollowed out tree trunks . Fifty-five of the trunks had been hollowed out and their ends replaced to carry the massive illicit load . The cigarettes had been made in Belarus and were heading to the address of a private company in Poland . Border guard spokesman Arkhip Glazkov said: 'As a result of a random check we discovered one of the trunks appeared to have been tampered with, and after looking more closely it was found that the tree trunk and been hollowed out and packed with cigarettes, and then the end of the trunk had been replaced to cover up the crime. 'In fact it was almost impossible to see the difference, but officers noticed that some of the logs seemed incredibly light compared to the others, and it was then that they discovered the fraud.' In total they recovered 25,000 packets of cigarettes hidden inside 27 tons of timber where 55 of the tree trunks turned out to have been tampered with. The find came just days after a hapless smuggler was caught trying to sneak an incredible 146 iPhones through Chinese customs by strapping them to his body. Chan Shih, 30, was found with 126 phones taped around his waist and another 20 around his legs after officers spotted him walking strangely. The 25,000 packets of cigarettes were bound for Germany and then the UK before they were intercepted . Border guard spokesman Arkhip Glazkov said: 'As a result of a random check we discovered one of the trunks appeared to have been tampered with' Twenty-seven tons of timber had been tampered with in the audacious attempted smuggling operation . It was almost impossible for guards to see the difference between the doctored logs and the regular ones . Border guard spokesman Arkhip Glazkov said: officers noticed that some of the logs seemed incredibly light compared to the others' He had been travelling from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland via the Louhu checkpoint in Shenzhen, reported People's Daily Online. A customs spokesman said: 'This is the fifth time he has been caught smuggling since 2011. 'In total he has tried to bring in 511 iPhones and 127 CPUs, all of which he strapped to parts of his body. 'He needs to think of a new way of doing it as it is getting a bit obvious.' The man was arrested and is now awaiting trial. Meanwhile two men have been jailed for smuggling 28 tonnes of cannabis into the UK - enough to get every person in the country stoned. Steven McDonald, 32, and John Wright, 66, were part of a crime network that trafficked drugs from the Netherlands on an 'industrial scale'. The cannabis they imported as part of the seven-year conspiracy would have had a street value in excess of £80million. At Luton Crown Court on Friday Wright was sentenced to nine years and four months in prison and McDonald was handed an eight-year sentence. The haul was recovered the other side of the country from the war-torn east. A February cease-fire in Ukraine's continuing civil war between government and rebel forces has eased hostilities .

"A Queensland woman hopes to become the youngest Australian to climb Mount Everest when she tackles the monster trek in two months. Alyssa Azar, 18, has been climbing since she was five, mainly because her father, Glenn, is a Kokoda Track instructor. At just eight years old, she successfully completed on the iconic trail in Papua with his help. Alyssa Azar, 18, has been climbing since she was five. Last year she attempted to climb Mount Everest (pictured) but an avalanche killed 16 Sherpa guides . Ms Azar hopes to become the youngest Australian to climb the world's highest peak . She has gone on to climb Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro, the 10 highest peaks in Australia, South America's Mount Aconcagua in the Andes, and Nepal's Ama Dablam and Manaslu. 'I started doing training when I was five or six,' Ms Azar told Daily Mail Australia. 'As I got older I got onto the higher altitudes. 'After Kilimanjaro in 2011, I decided I wanted to be a professional mountaineer... and put myself against the best.' Since climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in 2011, the teenager has been training to summit the Nepal mountain . She has been training hard, with her own equipment in the backyard (left) in Toowoomba in Queensland's south east, including a rope climb (right) The 18-year-old caught the climbing bug largely due to her father, Glenn, who is a Kokoda Track guide . Here Ms Azar is seen pulling a tyre with a face mask on to help her train to withstand the altitude of the climb . On Friday, Ms Azar will make her second expedition to conquer the world's highest peak, which stands at 8,848 metres above sea level. Last year the Toowoomba teenager was unsuccessful when an avalanche struck just days out from her planned climb and 16 Sherpa guides were killed. But the tragedy has not deterred her as the mountaineer attempts the summit again. If Ms Azar makes it to the top, she will beat the record set by Rex Pemberton, 21, who climbed Mt Everest in 2005. Here Ms Azar is pictured here with her dad when she was eight when she climbed the Kokoda Track in Papua . Since then the determined girl went on to complete many more feats before wanting to tackle Mt Everest . She is pictured here climbing Mt Kilimanjaro in 2011.

If she is successful in climbing Mt Everest, she will beat a record set by Rex Pemberton, 21, who climbed Mt Everest in 2005 . The 18-year-old has been training for the climb for years and has a set up in her backyard, which includes a rope climb. '[I do] endurance work, I do a little of indoor rock climbing... and I do a lot of basic workouts like swimming and running as well,' Ms Azar told Daily Mail Australia. 'It’s been a long time coming now and I'm ready to go and climb the mountain.' Ms Azar will fly into Lukla - a town in Nepal's north-east - and spend the first nine days of her two-month expedition trekking to base camp, which she describes as a 'comfortable trek'. Ms Azar said she had decided to come a professional mountaineer and has climbed up Nepal's Ama Dablam and Manaslu . Here she is trekking up South America's Mount Aconcagua in the Andes at 4,200 metres . Her two-month expedition will take her from Lukla - in Nepal's north-east - and will take her 8,848 metres above sea level . It will take her nine days to make the journey from the Nepalese town to the base camp of Mt Everest . Ms Azar said she loved mountaineering as it gave her a sense of adventure and let her experience nature . 'We start at [an altitude of] 3,000 metres in Lukla so we can adapt to the altitude and when we get to base camp it'll be 5,000 metres,' she said. Ms Azar, who describes herself as an introvert, said she loved mountaineering as it gave her a sense of adventure. 'I get really excited going to see new places and I like the intensity of Everest,' she said. 'I'm genuinely more introverted day-to-day... and you get to be in your own head space. 'The realness of environment is definitely part of it as well.'","Alyssa Azar, from Toowoomba in Queensland, will climb Nepal's Mt Everest .

"Foreign journalists have been invited on a week-long all expenses paid trip to the Great Barrier Reef as part of the federal government's campaign to stop it being put on the United Nations 'in danger' list. The reporters, who all hail from countries on the world heritage committee, are being flown to Queensland to see the reef and learn about the government's conservation efforts, Guardian Australia reports. The trip next week, which has reportedly been organised by a Great Barrier Reef taskforce set up by the Department of Foreign Affairs, comes before a Unesco committee meeting in June where the reef's World Heritage status will be considered. Foreign journalists have been invited on a week-long all expenses paid trip to the Great Barrier Reef as part of the federal government's campaign to stop it being put on the United Nations 'in danger' list . Conservation groups have since hit out at the government saying it should spend less time showing off their efforts to journalists and more time protecting the reef. 'We want to see the reef fixed and protected,' Felicity Wishart, spokeswoman for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, told Daily Mail Australia. 'The government is spending what seems like a massive amount of money sending bureaucrats, diplomats and ministers around the world to try and avoid an 'in danger' listing. 'Now they want to bring journalists to Australia to reassure them everything is under control - it's kind of missing the point.' A spokesman for the DFAT told the Guardian diplomatic efforts, like the journalist junket, was needed to counter misinformation spread by conservationists about the reef. The reporters, who all hail from countries on the world heritage committee, are being flown to Queensland to see the reef and learn about the government's conservation efforts . 'There is currently a campaign to list the Great Barrier Reef as in danger... we think there are a number of assertions about the management of the Great Barrier Reef and its vulnerability which are not grounded in fact and which need to be rebutted,' he said. The journalists from Germany, France, the Philippines, India, Japan and Portugal will meet with scientists, the chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and staff from the Environment Department. Environment Minister Greg Hunt stepped up the government's campaign against an 'in danger' listing last month arguing it is the 'best managed marine ecosystem in the world'. The conservationists say they are worried the journalists will be spun misleading information and will seek to provide them another side of the story when they arrive. 'There's lots of talk and money being spent but there's no protection of the reef,' Ms Wishart said. 'This is just a spin job to international journalists about the great things they are doing.'

"Everyone may be in love with the cast of characters on Lee Daniel's music-themed drama Empire, but behind the scenes the actors are far from in love with each other. Sources close to the record-breaking Fox series - which drew an impressive 21.1 million viewers for its season finale last week, the highest-rated finale since Grey's Anatomy in 2005 - tell Daily Mail Online that there is just as much drama behind the scenes as you see on camera. Empire is a hip-hop drama based on the story of Lucius Lyon, played by Terrence Howard, a former drug dealer turned hip hop mogul, and his ex-wife, Cookie (Taraji P. Henson). And while the couple are at odds in the show, they are co-conspirators behind the scenes. The insider revealed that Oscar nominees Taraji P.Henson and Terrence Howard have complete control the set. The two stars oversee the scripts and are often making changes as late as the day of taping. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Thick as thieves: Empire stars Terrence Howard and Taraji Henson rule the roost - both in the show and off . A leg up: The plotting pair have made sure they have control over scripts and co-stars .

She plays the lead on one of the hottest new shows on TV but Taraji P. Henson's off screen style is a lot more subtle than the character she plays on Empire, Cookie Lyon.

Meowch: A catfight scene in the season finale between Henson and Gealey was too close for comfort, says insider . 'They call for re-writes if they don't like the lines or feel as though another character is getting more camera time than they are,' says the source. 'They both have final approval over the script, which often frustrates the other actors because it causes their lines to regularly change.' Henson and her co-star Grace Gealey (Anika ""Boo Boo Kitty"" Calhoun) don't get along on the set. Sources say that Henson has been trying to lose weight and sometimes wears Spanx to cover her 'tummy pooch.' Apparently, she's envious of Gealey's small waist and the sexy, fitted dresses wardrobe likes to put her in. 'Taraji hates Grace's tiny figure and often complains to wardrobe about putting her in outfits sexier than her character's. She says stuff like, ""if you put her a** in anything tighter she won't be able to breathe,""' our source revealed. Meanwhile, Taraji herself wore a tight-fitting hot pink number at a recent Empire event. On set, the two actresses stay far, far away from each other. Their real-life tension seems to be captured in their on-camera feud, which ended in a physical fight scene on the season finale. Howard has had his own issues with co-star Malik Yoba (Vernon Turner), who sources say was killed off in the season finale at Howard's urging. 'He never liked working opposite Malik because women just swoon over him. During promotional appearances and public events, women would go crazy over Malik because he's been a Hollywood stud for a long time. Gone: Howard has had issues with co-star Malik Yoba (Vernon Turner), who sources say was killed off on the season finale at Howard's urging . Favoritism: Oscar nominee Gabourey Sidibe (left) is also unhappy with her limited story line on Empire and blames it on Henson favoring Ta'Rhonda Jones, who plays Cookie's assistant Porsha . 'That drove Terrence crazy,' the source explained. Yoba was often frustrated that he had limited lines and knew that Howard was responsible for getting his camera time cut short. Oscar nominee Gabourey Sidibe is also unhappy with her limited storyline on Empire and blames it on Henson favoring Ta'Rhonda Jones, who plays Cookie's assistant Porsha. Sidibe, who joined Empire fresh off of American Horror Story, feels she's regulated to just running down the hall shouting one and two word lines to Howard's character Lucius. 'She enjoys working, but feels like she's grossly under utilized on this show. She made jokes that she'd wish they would kill her off in the finale on the set,' our source shared. The awkward tension between the cast was also felt during a TCA panel at the Ace Hotel Theater in Los Angeles on March 13. Both Henson and Howard had bizarre outbursts while other cast members were answering  questions. Henson made an joke about her extremely long hair weave when Gealy was speaking as resulted in Gealy just rolled her eyes. When the crowd cheered loudly for Jussie Smollett after one of his answers, Howard ranted about wanting to play the game piccino on a cruise ship.","SPOILER ALERT (if you haven't watched the finale)

"A Swedish minister has accused Saudi Arabia of banning her from giving a speech at a meeting of the Arab League after she previously criticised the kingdom's human rights record. Sweden's foreign minister Margot Wallstroem has claimed that her criticism of Saudi Arabia over its treatment of blogger Raif Badawi resulted in her speech being cancelled at the meeting in Cairo. Ms Wallstroem had been invited as an honorary guest to the Arab ministers' meeting in praise of her government's decision to recognise Palestine as a state. Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallstroem, pictured with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. She claims she was banned from giving a speech at the Arab League by Saudi Arabia . However, an Arabic diplomat confirmed that Riyadh had stopped her from making her opening speech. Ms Wallstroem said: 'The explanation we have been given is that Sweden has highlighted the situation for democracy and human rights and that is why they do not want me to speak. 'It's a shame that a country has blocked my participation.' The Swedish foreign ministry has now published a version of Ms Wallstroem's speech on its website. Ms Wallstroem had been invited as an honorary guest to the Arab League headquarters in Cairo, pictured, in praise of her government's decision to recognise Palestine as a state . And although it did not mention Saudi Arabia or her feminist foreign policy agenda, it stressed human rights and rights for women. She was expected to say: 'Freedom of association, assembly, religion and expression are fundamental rights and important tools in the creation of vibrant societies. 'Women's rights do not only benefit women, but society as a whol.e . Ms Wallstroem has rarely commented on Saudi Arabia but in January she slammed the kingdom's treatment of Mr Badawi, who had been sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for insulting Islam.

Yet her country has a decade-long arms-trading deal with Riyadh which is not due for renewal for another five years in May.

"Hero: Jose Rosario, 47, was found dead on a Puerto Rico beach Monday, two days after he was swept away by a wave while saving a boy from drowning . A retired NYPD officer vacationing in Puerto Rico with his family this weekend was swept out to sea in front of his horrified wife and children after he heroically saved a 12-year-old boy from drowning. The body of Jose 'Joe' Rosario, 47, washed ashore Monday, two days after he jumped into the water off Playa de Jobos to save his son’s friend who was struggling to stay afloat in choppy waters. Rosario, a retired Manhattan police detective, was able to pull the 12-year-old to safety, but he proved no match for a powerful wave. Leisha Chen, Rosario's stepdaughter, said the boy urged his rescuer to grab onto him, but she said Rosario was afraid the child would lose his grip and go under. 'That's when another wave hit and my stepfather got pulled out further,' Chen, a married mother of one, told the New York Post. Rosario's teenage daughter, Anais, detailed in a heart-breaking Facebook post how she, her brother and their mother helplessly looked on from the beach as the 47-year-old father of three floundered in rough seas. ‘My dad did everything he could and helped my brothers [sic] friend get out of the ocean but he couldn't get out himself,’ Anais Rosario wrote. ‘The current took him away and after a while we couldn't see him anymore. The coast guard and the cops have been looking for him since but he hasn't turned up. Family man: Rosario's family, including (L to R) daughter Anais, stepdaughter Leisha Chan, his young son and his wife, looked on in horror as the 20-year NYPD veteran floundered in the surf . Death in paradise: Rosario jumped into the water off Playa de Jobos, where the family were vacationing, to rescue his son's friend . ‘I don't know what's going to happen and if he's still out there or not but no matter what he is a hero and always has been.’ On Monday, when Mr Rosario's lifeless body turned up on the beach in Puerto Rico, his devastated daughter paid tribute to her dad in another touching post. 'Rip dad, I will love you forever and you will always be in my heart and with me wherever I go. I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me,’ Anais wrote, expressing hope that one day they will reunite in heaven. Saturday was not the first time that Jose Rosario, a 20-year veteran of the NYPD, put himself in harm's way to save a child’s life. Several years ago, the retired detective had rescued his stepdaughter's young cousin who was drowning in a pool at a Puerto Rico resort, located about a mile from the spot where he died Saturday. New York's finest: Rosario (pictured left and right with his daughter) retired from the force after serving as a detective for two decades . Noble end: Leisha Chen, pictured here on her wedding day, detailed how her stepfather (far right) was able to pull the drowning boy to safety. The child urged the father of three to grab onto him, but Rosario was afraid the 12-year-old would lose his grip . 'That's who he was,' Leisha Chen told the New York Post. 'He would give his life to anybody.' The Washingtonville Youth Football and Cheerleading League, where Rosario volunteered as an equipment director, paid tribute to the brave ex-cop Monday. ‘Today the Wizards family has lost one of our own,’ a statement from the youth league read. ‘Joe Rosario, great father, great coach, a great man. He has touched many of us through his passion and dedication to the boys and girls of youth sports. He will always be in our memories. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the Rosario family.’","Jose Rosario, 47, was vacationing in Puerto Rico last week when his son's friend found himself in trouble while swimming in the ocean .

"City breaks have overtaken beach holidays as the most popular getaway choice for British tourists, according to a new study. With the pound strengthening against the euro and other currencies, prices have dropped by as much as 22 per cent over last year in three quarters of the cities included in Post Office Travel Money's annual report on city costs. Eastern European cities offer bargain hunters the best value with Vilnius, Lithuania, topping the list. Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, offers bargain hunters the best value as a city break destination, says a study . Budapest, Hungary, also offers British travellers a great deal, with a weekend getaway tallying £119.77 . The newest eurozone member has seen a fall of over 15 per cent year-on-year with a three-course evening meal for two including drinks and two nights' accommodation coming in at just £100.04. The cost of a weekend break in Vilnius is half of what visitors would pay in perennial favourites Paris, Rome and Amsterdam. Budapest is another great money-saving destination, where a two night getaway comes in at just £119.77. And in Riga, travellers will not only benefit from cheap transport options, but also the cheapest rate (£36) for a two-night stay in a three-star city centre hotel during the month of April. In Riga, Latvia, not only is transport extremely affordable, but three-star city centre hotels are cheapest . And when it comes to Western Europe, Post Office Travel Money recommends heading to Athens for a deal . 1. Vilnius, Lithuania - £100.04 . 2. Budapest, Hungary - £119.77 . 3. Riga, Latvia - £120.39 . 4. Tallinn, Estonia - £131.28 . 5. Athens, Greece - £131.35 . 6. Dubrovnik, Croatia - £139.83 . 7. Prague, Czech Republic - £141.24 . 8. Lisbon, Portugal - £141.37 . 9. Krakow, Poland - £144.96 . 10. Strasbourg, France - £169.60 . *Cost of two nights' accommodation and a three-course meal for two with drinks . But it's not only Eastern Europe that offers UK tourists some serious value. Athens, which is a new entry in the report, comes in fifth with a weekend city break coming in at just £131.35, which puts it as the cheapest in Western Europe. Last year's cheapest Western break, Lisbon, dropped to eighth place this year. The Czech city of Prague also offers great bang for a British traveller's buck, boasting cheap meals and drinks. Dining out costs as little as £23.94 for two people, while a bottle of beer is just £1.13. Krakow, Poland, and Strasbourg, France, are two additional new entries to the list this year. Proving that not all French cities must be needlessly expensive, Strasbourg is noteworthy for being 35 per cent cheaper than Paris. For the third consecutive year, Stockholm is Europe's most expensive city with holidaymakers spending an average of £311.01 for a two-night getaway. London is the seventh most expensive city break, with costs averaging £266.65, according to the study. While perennial favourite, Paris, is a very expensive French destination, Strasbourg offers good value . If money is not a concern, Stockholm has been named Europe's most expensive city for the third year in a row . Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'It's a win/win situation for UK holidaymakers this year in European cities because prices are down in the majority of cities we surveyed, thanks to the soaring value of sterling.' However, he does recommend that travellers do their homework before setting out, as prices do vary significantly across cities. 'Remember that the cost of meals and drinks will need to be added into the spending budget, as city breaks are never all-inclusive holidays,' he explains. 'Over the course of a two- or three-night break, these can make a big difference to the cost of a city break and the low prices in Prague, Athens and Budapest will make these cities strong contenders for a bargain break rival to the Baltic states.'","Weekend breaks have overtaken beach holidays as most popular getaway .

"Welsh rugby fan Edryd James faces a police investigation after homophobic abuse against referee Nigel Owens was posted from his Twitter account . A young Welsh rugby fan faces a police investigation after homophobic abuse against referee Nigel Owens was posted from his Twitter account. Edryd James, 18, was in the eye of a storm of controversy after the short message appeared on his account on Saturday evening. The Swansea University student is suspected of posting: ‘Your a gay c*** awful performance against france tonight, how did england top Wales?’ The comment sparked hundreds of replies in which rugby fans of all colours said it was disgraceful and voiced their support for Owens. But James, who lives with his family in Cynwyl Elfed, near Carmarthen, West Wales, claimed his phone had been stolen and he was not responsible. The teenager, who describes himself online in Welsh as a ‘Welshman who enjoys life’, has posted many other comments about his love of rugby and heavy drinking sessions. His mother Meiner James, 58, told the Daily Mail she was ‘aware something has happened’ and said she was ‘trying to get to the bottom of it’. Owens, once named as gay sports personality of the year, was encouraged by many other internet users to report the abuse while others said he should ignore it. The veteran referee – who came out seven years ago – was generally praised for his control of England’s 55-35 victory over France. Among those who spoke out for him were former Wales fly-half Jonathan Davies, Will Carling and Wasps fly-half Andy Goode. Owens later tweeted: ‘An absolute pleasure & privilege to ref one of the best games of rugby ever. Huge credit to England & France for making it a great game.’ Dyfed Powys Police said it has launched an inquiry into ‘alleged homophobic remarks’. A spokesman said: ‘This follows a number of complaints made by members of the public. The Tweet concerned has now been removed from the page. The investigation is at an early stage.’ Edryd James, 18, was in the eye of a storm of controversy after the short message appeared on his account on Saturday evening . Owens, who came out as gay seven years ago, replied to the tweet and it was later reported to the police . The referee (pictured speaking to England's fly-half George Ford) took charge of yesterday's Six Nations match between England and France . It was the first time Owens had taken charge at Twickenham since he received homophobic abuse from the stands during England’s 24-21 defeat to New Zealand in the autumn. On that occasion two people were banned from Rugby HQ for two years and ordered to pay £1,000 to a charity of Owens’ choice. Trolls who post racist, homophobic and threatening abuse have been dealt with extremely harshly in other high profile cases. Police forces are keen to show that comments made online are as damaging as those made to someone’s face in the street. Last year a Twitter troll was jailed for 18 weeks for bombarding a Labour MP with abusive messages after she supported a successful campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note. Peter Nunn, 33, from Bristol, retweeted ‘menacing' posts threatening to rape Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, and branded her a 'witch'. Last month Twitter’s chief executive admitted that the company ‘sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls’ in a leaked memo.","Welsh rugby fan faces police investigation after rugby referee was abused .

"A British Sky TV researcher who started a new life in the Caribbean died after bungling doctors botched a routine operation and starved her brain of oxygen for up to 15 minutes, an inquest has heard. Kate Clayton, 30, fell into an induced coma after medics inserted an airway tube into the wrong part of her throat, causing her face to swell up uncontrollably and leaving her with fatal brain damage. Her distraught mother Jo told an inquest how the doctor responsible for her daughter's care in Grand Cayman admitted: 'I'm very sorry, I messed up.' Kate Clayton, 30, originally from Southampton, died after bungling doctors on a Caribbean island starved her brain of oxygen during a routine operation, an inquest has heard . A leading medic from Southampton, where Miss Clayton was later transferred for emergency treatment, also told the hearing that he could 'not understand' why it had taken doctors so long to realise their mistake. In a narrative verdict, the coroner openly criticised the care given to Miss Clayton at Georgetown Hospital, ruling that she died 'as a direct result of the failed tracheotomy' which was 'inadequately carried out.' The inquest, which was heard in Winchester, heard how Miss Clayton had been rushed to hospital on the Caribbean island in January this year after a horror crash which left her paralysed from the chest down. The young woman, originally from Southampton, had moved to Grand Cayman in December 2013 to embark on her dream career as a diving instructor after leaving her job as an analyst at Sky. Mrs Clayton, who flew to the Caribbean from the UK following the crash to be at Miss Clayton's bedside, told how her daughter had been conscious and improving in the days before her death. She had even regained some feeling in her legs and was building up enough strength to talk to her family back in the UK on Skype, the inquest was told. But Miss Clayton's recovery was derailed when she underwent the tracheotomy, an operation which went 'horribly wrong' and left the young woman fighting for her life. The operation had been carried out so that Miss Clayton, who was relying on tubes to breathe, would be able to breathe on her own. The former researcher was flown back to Southampton General Hospital (pictured) for emergency treatment after an online appeal raised more than £30,000 in four days, but she could not be saved . But, instead of inserting a breathing tube into Miss Clayton's trachea, medics inserted the tube into her mouth, meaning oxygen was pumped straight into her neck tissue. Mrs Clayton told the inquest that she had been waiting outside in the hospital corridor for news of the routine operation when one of the medics took her aside to explain what had gone wrong. The inquest heard how the operation had already been postponed for a day because doctors could not find the right tube to insert in her throat. 'I was eventually told that I could go in but I had to go into the side room and talk to the doctors,' she told the coroner. 'I had to pass her room to go to the side room and being mum I still had to go and look. She was lying there with her eyes open, she looked like she'd been in a boxing match. She was all swollen up and my immediate instinct was that she was dead. 'Dr McField came in and he was really upset, his words to me were ""I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry I've messed up, I've messed up. The usual procedure went horribly wrong, it was my mistake"". 'He then told us Kate had been starved of oxygen and she was in an induced coma.' She added: 'She was having seizures which she hadn't had before. Due to the botched tracheotomy everything was sort of done. I don't think anybody knew quite what was happening, so it was a big panic. 'I left Kate at 4.32pm a happy person looking forward to coming home and found her a couple of hours later just not good. I thought she was dead and in real terms she was. 'She had the operation to stabilise her neck but she was having seizures in between time, it was horrible to see your kid having fits. Her eyes rolled and she frothed at the mouth but she wasn't there, her eyes were just gone, there was no light there. 'I'm just so sorry. What I feel is just she was so good and excited and suddenly it was all taken away.' After the botched operation, an online appeal called Help Kate Get Home raised £36,000 in just four days, providing her family enough money to bring Miss Clayton back to the UK. However, just one week after arriving Southampton General Hospital, she died while in the intensive care unit. The 30-year-old had moved to the Cayman Islands (pictured) to work as a diving instructor in December 2013 . Colin Griffiths, a consultant neuro-surgeon at the Southampton General Hospital, told the hearing in Winchester that he could not understand how doctors had made such an elementary mistake. 'I don't understand why they weren't able to get the tube back into place, right away. In my experience they should have been able to,' he told the inquest. Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Sarah Whitby said: 'On January 11 2015 the deceased Kate Clayton was severely injured in a road traffic accident on Grand Cayman island. 'Miss Clayton was treated at the Cayman Island Hospital for significant spinal, pelvic and bowel injuries and in the course of her treatment had a failed tracheotomy procedure where the procedure and its management prevented any oxygen from reaching her brain for at period off at least eight minutes, and resulted in hypoxic brain injury. 'On the balance of probabilities and relying on medical records and evidence from Miss Clayton's family, her subsequent death on the 18th of February 2015 having been transferred to Southampton General Hospital, was as a direct result of the failed tracheotomy which the evidence indicates was inadequately carried out.' Miss Clayton's family declined to comment after the inquest.","Kate Clayton, 30, from Southampton, moved to the Cayman Islands in  2013 .

"The Duke of Cambridge made the unannounced ‘private visit’ on Thursday to Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) Prince William has made a top secret visit to Britain’s most secretive building, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The Duke of Cambridge made the unannounced ‘private visit’ on Thursday to Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) – the maximum security ‘listening station’ which tracks electronic traffic of terrorists and spy agencies around the world. The Duke’s first ever trip to GCHQ, housed in a doughnut-shaped building in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed that he and other young Royals were being advised to change their email addresses and cut back on social media activities over fears they could be targeted by foreign spies and hackers. But questions were asked last night about the Duke’s use of a publicly funded Royal helicopter to make the trip, as it was not an official public engagement and was not announced in the Palace’s Court Circular. The Duke was flown from London’s Kensington Palace to Gloucestershire airport on the Queen’s helicopter Flight, funded by the taxpayer, and which is supposed to be only used for official engagements by the Royals. Under Government rules, the Royals have to pay for their own private visits. But last night Kensington Palace declined to comment on the reasons for the trip or confirm whether the Prince would pay back the estimated £8,000 travel costs. A Palace source initially described the 200-mile round trip as a ‘private visit’ but later suggested it was ‘official’, and so could possibly be paid from the taxpayer-funded Royal Travel Budget. The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) – the maximum security ‘listening station’ which tracks electronic traffic of terrorists and spy agencies around the world . Kensington Palace and GCHQ refused to say whom he met, or what he saw. But it is believed the Prince met the new head of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, and also saw the agency’s code breakers at work, monitoring internet and communications traffic to pick up terrorist threats. Other members of the Royal family have previously visited GCHQ, which was opened by the Queen in 2004. A GCHQ spokesman said yesterday: ‘Prince William paid a private visit to GCHQ on March 19. As it was a private visit we can’t go into further details of what his itinerary involved.’","Duke of Cambridge made a top secret 'private visit' to GCHQ on Thursday .

"Large percentages of teenagers admitted that they engage in dangerous behaviors while driving as varied as changing contact lenses to doing homework. Twenty-seven per cent of those surveyed said that they have changed clothes or shoes behind the wheel. 'Teens are busy, I guess,' lead author David Hurwitz of Oregon State University told NPR. Large percentages of teenagers admitted that they text or change their clothes and shoes while behind the wheel . The young adults, aged 14 to 18 in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, responded to questions about their driving habits for his study, published in the Journal of Transportation Safety & Security. Other distractions including changing radio stations, adjusting a GPS system, putting on makeup and a teenager who admitted playing guitar while driving. Cellphones are the biggest dangers to both adults and teenagers. Forty per cent out of 1400 Pacific Northwest teens said they had texted while driving, which is a decline from earlier studies. Distracted driving is the leading cause of among all drivers, including teenagers. More than 3,000 people were killed by distracted driving in 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Distracting behaviors, which are thought to contribute to more than 3,000 accident deaths a year, vary from texting (right) to putting on makeup (left) Practices such as texting can be especially dangerous to young drivers. Eleven per cent of all drivers under 20 in fatal car accidents were distracted when they crashed. Dr Hurwitz took teenagers into a classroom to demonstrate that completing simple tasks like writing on a chalkboard were much harder when attention was being pulled away by telephone conversations or other distractions. The scientist said that after the class, 'students were slightly better at recognizing the risks of multitasking behind the wheel,' to Yahoo News. Many states have laws against young drivers texting or speaking on the phone while driving.","Forty per cent of Pacific Northwest drivers admitted texting while driving .

"The parents of a young girl with leukemia who want to build their daughter an outdoor playhouse have been blocked by their homeowners association. Pete and Jennifer Schultz, who live in the Kansas City, Missouri, suburb of Raymore, say they need the playhouse for their 6-year-old daughter, Ella Joe, because her health keeps her from playing with other children. 'She's earned this — she deserves it,' Pete Schultz told The Kansas City Star. 'She can't get out and play with other kids. This playhouse is what she would have. Is it really going to hurt someone?' Scroll down for video . Ella Joe Schultz of Raymore, Missouri is battling leukemia. When Make-A-Wish asked what she would like she asked for a playhouse, but the local homeowners association said no. Ella Joe and her family live at this home in Raymore, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri, and had wanted to erect a 'barn-style' playhouse outside it . The Make-A-Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to children with life-threatening illnesses, contacted Ella Joe's parent offering to grant a wish to Ella. The young girl said she wanted a playhouse and at first everything seemed to be going well. The shingles of the house were even going to match the ones throughout the neighborhood. But the homeowners association said no. 'The proposed plan they've given us is a violation of our covenants,' Stonegate HOA board president Stacy Bayers told KCTV. The homeowners group has since published a statement on its website saying the proposal for a 'barn-style' playhouse was denied because it didn't have enough details to merit an exemption. 'Our hearts are with Ella Schultz and her family as they battle this terrible illness,' it read. 'She's earned this — she deserves it': Father Pete Schultz said his daughter asked for the playhouse because she can't get out and play with other kids . Stonegate HOA board president Stacy Bayers told KCTV that the initial request was turned down because it violated covenants . The Stonegate of the Good Ranch is committed to working with the Make-A-Wish Foundation 'to see if we can figure out a way to make Ella's wish come true,' and the group has requested additional information from the charity and a construction company that has committed to building the play house. One local man has even offered via Ella Joe's GoFundMe page to put her playhouse in his yard. As this plays out, Ella Joe has been in the hospital fighting complications from her cancer. The Schultz's neighbors have rallied around the family before, including last year, when after spending several months in the hospital, Ella Joe came home to a neighborhood parade.

"Police have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a spate of attacks on pensioners sneezing in Carlisle . A thug is believed to be randomly attacking pensioners shopping in the street who dare to sneeze. Police have received five reports of a man slapping people in Carlisle town centre who sneezed, including from a 65-year-old woman who was hit on the head. Officers have released CCTV images of the man they are looking for, who is targeting 'innocent members of the public.' They said the offence was certainly unique, and they were treating it incredibly seriously. The first reported incident occurred took place on February 19 between 11.15am and 11.30am outside the Andalusian bar in Warwick Road in Carlisle. The victim was a 65-year-old woman who was slapped on the head after sneezing. On 17 March an 82-year-old woman was also targeted by a man, who police believe is the same attacker. PC Mike Watson, of Cumbria Constabulary said: 'This is certainly a unique type of incident and one that is being treated seriously by ourselves. 'The offender is assaulting innocent members of the public and that sort of behaviour will not be tolerated. 'We would also like to appeal to anyone who may be a victim to come forward as your information could bring this offender to justice. 'We would like to speak to the person pictured in the CCTV image in connection with these offences. 'We appeal to anyone who recognises him to make contact, any information provided could be crucial to our investigation.' Other reports of incidents included a 77-year-old woman from Carlisle being attacked on February 24, and a 67-year-old man being targeted at the town's bus station on March 4. Just three days later a 65-year-old woman was attacked in The Lanes Shopping Centre. Most of the attacks took place between 11am and 12.30pm on each of the days. The man is said to be targeting people in Carlisle town centre, slapping them when they sneeze . As well as the five reports, police have been informed of two further incidents where the victim has not yet come forward. The man is believed to be in his 50s. Shoppers in Carlisle are said to have been confused by the incident. Gemma Prosser, 19, a trainee shop assistant, said: 'We heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird. 'When you think about it, it is really awful because anyone can sneeze at any time and it's not your fault.'","A man has been targeting pensioners in Carlisle who have been sneezing .

"Alex Salmond has taken to drinking 'pink champagne' in the afternoon, it has been revealed . A Labour government propped up by the SNP has been voted the worst possible outcome at the general election - but Alex Salmond has insisted he will support Ed Miliband's bid for power come what may. Six out of 10 voters said they would be 'dismayed' by a Labour-SNP alliance. This compares with 54 per cent who said they did not want a Labour-Lib Dem coalition and 52 per cent dreading another pact between David Cameron and Nick Clegg, according to the pollsters YouGov. Despite the unpopularity of an SNP-Labour alliance, Mr Salmond - who has taken to drinking pink champagne in the afternoon - has revealed that the party will do whatever it can to make Mr Miliband Prime Minister in order to wring as many concessions out of him as possible. The revelation comes after David Cameron said Mr Miliband had given up trying to win the election outright and was pinning all his hopes on the SNP helping him over the line. The PM said Mr Salmond had taken the entire Labour Party hostage and was using Mr Miliband as his poodle. The attack, at Prime Minister's Questions, comes amid dire polls for Labour pointing to a landslide election victory for the SNP. Mr Salmond had earlier told the Spectator magazine that the SNP will use its power in Parliament after the election to block any attempt by the Tories to form a minority government - even if it had failed to strike a deal with Labour. The revelation makes the prospect of a Tory minority government less likely - while increasing the prospect of Mr Miliband becoming Prime Minister. The SNP has already promised to work with Labour in return for sweeping spending increases and the end of Britain's Trident nuclear weapons. Labour has ruled out a formal Labour-SNP coalition but not the prospect of working on a vote-by-vote basis if it fails to win enough seats to govern alone. A Labour government propped up by the SNP is the worst possible outcome at the general election for most UK voters, a new poll has revealed . Speaking in the final Prime Minister's Questions session of the Parliament, Mr Cameron said the SNP had 'taken the entire Labour Party hostage'. To cheers from the Tory benches Mr Cameron added: 'And the ransom note is very clear. It says higher borrowing, uncontrolled immigration, unfettered welfare, higher taxes and weaker defence. 'That's what is being demanded and the British people have only one way of saying no to this appalling hostage situation - and that is to vote Conservative on May 7.' Mr Cameron's attack comes amid growing alarm at the prospect of chaotic coalition negotiations in the result of hung Parliament after the general election in May. According to today's YouGov poll, published in the Times, more people fear Coalition government than either the Tories or Labour winning outright in May. David Cameron said Alex Salmond had taken the entire Labour Party hostage and was using Ed Miliband as his poodle . Just under half the public think a Labour majority government is the worst possible outcome - compared to 45 per cent who said a Tory majority was the worst result. A quarter said they would be 'delighted' or would not mind a Labour-SNP alliance, compared with a third broadly positive about Lab-Lib coalition, 37 per cent positive about another Tory-Lib pact, 41 per cent backing a Labour majority and 46 per cent a Tory majority. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to 'lock the Tories out of government', with her predecessor Alex Salmond yesterday confirming the SNP would side with Labour to vote down a minority Tory government's Queen's speech. Today's YouGov poll of 8,271 UK voters, including 633 in Scotland, suggests the SNP could be on course to take about half of former Liberal Democrat and Labour voters in Scotland, and even a fifth of former Conservative voters. The Tories have released a campaign video showing Alex Salmond 'calling Ed Miliband's tune' Half of 2010 Lib Dem voters said they will definitely or may possibly vote SNP in May while 44 per cent of former Labour voters and 20 per cent of former Conservative voters said the same. Excerpts of a Scottish breakdown of the poll, published in The Times, found more than two-thirds of people in Scotland think Labour 'has seriously lost touch with ordinary working people'. Three out of four people in Scotland said Labour needs to change its policies to become fit for government again while more than half think the party has not yet faced up to 'the damage it wrought on the economy'. Nearly half (45 per cent) said the Labour Party in Scotland used to care about people like them but now does not, compared with 26 per cent who said they still do. About one in ten (11 per cent) said Labour have never cared about people like them and just 3 per cent said they now care about them after previously dismissing them in the past. A total of 69 per cent said Labour 'has seriously lost touch with ordinary working people'. Almost a third (29 per cent) of people in Scotland said they would be 'delighted' with the SNP supporting a minority Labour government. Two-thirds of people in Scotland would be dismayed by another Tory-Lib coalition while 52 per cent would not like a Lab-Lib Democrat coalition. About half (51 per cent) said the SNP cared about them but 31 per cent said the SNP does not represent their interests. YouGov surveyed 8,271 voters across the UK, including 633 in Scotland, between March 18 and 23.","Alex Salmond vows to use alliance with Labour to wring concessions .

"A truck reportedly bore a flag for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in Michigan over the weekend. On Sunday morning, the flag was just a short distance away from the United States Army Reserve Center in Southfield, WWJ reported. Reserve center officials told the CBS affiliate that an anti-terrorism drill involved the flag. Incident: A truck reportedly bore a flag for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Michigan over the weekend (file photo) The truck was away from the reserve center for a short period of time, officials told the television station, and said they were sorry for the confusion. The news arrives as the US Marine Corps on Sunday urged 'vigilance' after a group claiming to be Islamic State hackers published what they said were the names and addresses of 100 military personnel and urged supporters to kill them. The warning came after a group calling itself the Islamic State Hacking Division posted information about members of the air force, army and navy, including photos and ranks, on the Internet, according to monitoring group SITE Intelligence. The US Marine Corps said it was visiting all affected staff, and urged caution online. 'Vigilance and force protection considerations remain a priority for commanders and their personnel,' US Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel John Caldwell said in a statement, adding that the threat remained 'unverified'. 'It is recommended Marines and family members check their online/social footprint, ensuring privacy settings are adjusted to limit the amount of available personal information.' The Pentagon regularly tells service members to be careful about what they post online. The self-proclaimed IS Hacking Division claimed it took the information from government servers, databases and emails and called on its followers to mount attacks. Threat: The news comes as US Marine Corps on Sunday urged 'vigilance' after a group claiming to be Islamic State hackers published what they said were the names and addresses of 100 military personnel and urged supporters to kill them . A defense source, however, told The New York Times most of the information was in fact available in public records and did not appear to have been hacked from government servers. The IS Hacking Division said the 100 military staff had targeted the Islamic State group in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. 'With the huge amount of data we have from various different servers and databases, we have decided to leak 100 addresses so that our brothers residing in America can deal with you,' the group wrote. 'Now we have made it easy for you by giving you addresses, all you need to do is take the final step, so what are you waiting for?' NATO commander Philip Breedlove called the publication an attempt by IS to divert attention from military setbacks. 'What we have seen across the last several months is that every time they take a defeat on the battlefield, or every time they are under great pressure on the battlefield, they come out with kind of some big splash like this,' he said at a conference in Brussels. 'This caliphate, I think, is under great pressure and so they try to divert attention from what is happening on the battlefield,' he added. A defense department official told AFP they were investigating the posting. 'I can't confirm the validity of the information, but we are looking into it,' the official said. 'The safety of our service members is always a concern.' A group calling itself the Islamic State Hacking Division posted information about members of the air force, army and navy,  according to monitoring group SITE Intelligence . SITE Intelligence noted that service members' photos and ranks were posted online . The United States is leading an international coalition targeting the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, where the Islamist militants have taken over swaths of territory. IS has claimed responsibility for hacking attacks in the United States in the past, including against Central Command, which oversees the air war against the IS group. In January, the hacked Centcom Twitter feed posted what appeared to be an office phone directory of officers that was slightly out of date, forcing the military temporarily to take down the command's Twitter feed. The words 'CyberCaliphate' and 'I love you ISIS' replaced Central Command's usual logo on Twitter and YouTube before the pages were suspended. This month, the FBI said it was investigating a string of hacks that defaced US websites with imagery from the Islamic State jihadist group. Websites including a racecar speedway in the state of Ohio, a used-clothes store in Missouri and a church in Canada were defaced with the radical group's black flag. Attacks against similar low-profile websites were also recorded in Montana, New York, Massachusetts and Minnesota. The Islamic state group has relied on an aggressive propaganda campaign online to appeal to possible recruits to join and support the violent Islamists in Iraq and Syria. US commanders and senior officials have previously said the IS group has shown a great acumen for propaganda and for promoting itself to potential jihadist recruits. The group has called for so-called lone wolf, or freelance, attacks in coalition countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan and Italy.","The flag was observed Sunday morning a short distance from the United States Army Reserve Center in Southfield .

"A driver has been arrested after a £200,000 supercar  was allegedly spotted driving at 150mph on the M25. The black and white Ferrari California  was pulled over by two police cars last night on the busy motorway near Woking, Surrey. The car has been seized by police while a man, aged 25, was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and has since been bailed. Surrey Police tweeted this message last night after this Ferrari California was alleged seen doing 150mph . The car was allegedly seen doing the high speeds between junctions 8 and 10 of the M25 in Surrey . Officers say the high-performance vehicle, the first model of which was released in 2008, was seen doing 150mph between junctions eight, near Reigate, and junction 10, near Woking. The police force tweeted a photo of the car alongside the message: '#M25 J8-10 Ferrari California 150mph with two police cars behind. Vehicle seized and driver arrested.' The force later revealed it had 'numerous calls' about the car and responded within three minutes. It is believed the police cars which pulled over the Ferrari were BMW 530s, which a police source described as 'pretty nifty, if not as fast as a Ferrari'. The Italian-made vehicle appears to have a personalised number plate and red interior. Other motorists on Twitter expressed shock that the vehicle managed to reach such speeds on a road famous for its heavy traffic. Dawn Denyer tweeted: 'I'm normally lucky to get to 60mph on that stretch. Is that what the new variable speed signs are for?' The car is built at the famous manufacturer's plant in Maranello, Italy and does 0-60 in less than four seconds .

"A notorious anti-Semitic comedian has been spared jail for tweeting his sympathy for the terrorist behind the Paris Jewish supermarket massacre, which killed four people. Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, 48, used the rallying slogan 'Je Suis Charlie' to make a joke relating to gunman Amedy Coudlibaly, who murdered a policewoman and carried out the devastating attack on the kosher supermarket in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January. The provocative entertainer had denied any wrongdoing and said the case exposed the hypocrisy of a country which 'pretends' to be a bastion of free speech. Comedian: Dieudonne M'bala M'bala has been found guilty of 'apologising for terrorism' after posting a joke on Facebook which referred to the gunman behind the Paris kosher supermarket attack . He also maintained that he 'condemned the attacks without reservation and without any ambiguity.' But M'bala, who has previous convictions for anti-Semitism, was found guilty of 'apologising for terrorism' following his trial at the Palais de Justice in Paris. The court heard how, just days after the Paris attacks in January, he had posted on Facebook 'Tonight, as far as I'm concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly'. The post combined the 'Je Suis Charlie' slogan with the name of one of the gunman involved in the supermarket hostage. Terrorist Amedy Coulibaly was also a close friend of Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, the gunmen involved in the Charlie Hebdo shooting at the satirical magazine. Staff working at the publication's headquarters were targeted in January for drawing insulting cartoons about the Prophet Mohammed and for attacking Muslims generally. During the trial, defence barrister Sanjay Mirabeau said Dieudonne's arrest in January was disproportionate. Yet it was followed by police questioning more than 70 others for similar alleged crimes. Mr Mirabeau said the case against his client should be thrown out 'because it is the job of humourists to make people laugh'. He was given a two-month suspended prison sentence. French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala (left) and his defence barrister Sanjay Mirabeau leaving court on Wednesday . President Francois Hollande's government ordered a major clampdown on hate-speech following the terrorist attacks, which left a total of 20 people dead, including Coulibaly and the two other terrorists. Dieudonne drew international attention last year when football star Nicolas Anelka celebrated an English Premiership goal with a salute popularised by the comic which critics said was anti-Semitic. Called a 'quenelle', it has been described as a reverse Nazi salute, and was used by Anelka while he was playing for West Bromwich Albion. Al Qaeda in Yemen claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, but intelligence officials believe the terror group provided inspiration, rather than any logistical or financial support. Since the attacks, France has deployed 10,000 troops and 120,000 security forces to protect sensitive sites, including synagogues, mosques and travel hubs.","Dieudonne M'bala M'bala was in the dock charged with inciting terrorism .

"Independent Senator Jacqui Lambie has rubbished claims of a Canberra makeover, and confessed she arrived in parliament with a wardrobe made up entirely of op-shop purchases. Ms Lambie said her thrift was the result of more than $20,000 of debt, which meant she was not able to splash out on her clothing. However, the fiery politician said she has splashed out on at least one luxury, admitting to getting botox injections in her back and face, according to the Daily Telegraph.

'I haven't had a makeover,' Senator Lambie said, when asked if she had undergone a make-over since she arrived in Canberra. 'This is how it works. When I first came in, because I had sold my house and used every last bit of money I had, Clive Palmer in the end helped me get over the line, I had nothing left. 'It took a couple of months to get back on my feet and the only things in my wardrobe I pretty much got from Vinnies over the last two years. It would have only been $3 to $4 apiece.

I've got girlfriends. One of them owns the shop in Davenport. I try to keep it local. So I thought, 'bugger it, I will just do it at Christmas time when they've got all their sales and stuff'.

"Twins born via caesarean section minutes after a car crash that killed their mother have been released from hospital. Ashton Hughes was driving home from a doctor's appointment in Spartanburg, South Carolina on January 6  when she ran into the back of a stopped SUV. The 19-year-old, who was seven months pregnant and had her 11-month-old daughter Dixie in the car, was conscious after the crash but complained of pain to her abdomen. She was taken to hospital where her twins - a boy and a girl - were born. The young mother suffered internal bleeding and sadly passed away after briefly holding her children, her devastated family revealed after the crash. Saved: Newborn twins Ashton Gailann Jennings and Brantley Wayne Jennings, pictured, were born on Tuesday January 6 after their mother was in a car crash. They survived but she later passed away . Tragic: Their mother, Ashton Hughes (pictured with her fiance Zack Jennings) died from her injuries following the c-section but saw the babies before she passed away. They will now be brought up by Zack . But the twins have now been released from hospital and will be brought up by Ashton's fiance Zack Jennings, with help from his mother and Ashton's family, Fox Carolina reported. Ashton Gailann Jennings, named after her mother, was born weighing 2lb 12oz, while Brantley Wayne Jennings was 3lb 2oz. The babies stayed in intensive care at Spartanburg Medical Center for around 12 weeks. It is thought the babies survived because they were delivered so soon after the crash, doctors said. They are now doing well and visited their grandfather Eric Hughes on Sunday. Ashton's mother, Misty Fink, told WYFF shortly after the crash that her daughter lost too much blood during the emergency delivery. Her cause of death has not yet been determined. After his daughter's death Eric Hughes said: 'It just hurts my heart so bad. I wish that I could take her place any day.' He added that he was relieved her babies survived, including her toddler Dixie, who was in the back of her car at the time of the crash and only suffered a few minor scrapes,The State reported. Loved: She also leaves behind an 11-month-old daughter Dixie, pictured left after her birth, who was in the car but only suffered a scrape. Pictured right with Zack . 'That's the best part about this,' he said. 'I'm thankful for them being here, but totally saddened by her being gone. The only thing I know we can do is pray and hope for the best.' Ashton had recently left her job at Chick-fil-A in Duncan to focus on bringing up her children. Zack worked as an assistant manager at the same Chick-fil-A. A former co-worker described Ashton as 'one of the sweetest people I've ever met'. Her family said she loved to wear camouflage clothing and chose a casket for her lined with camouflage material. The Spartanburg County Coroner's Office and S.C. Highway Patrol are still investigating the crash to determine what happened. Heartbroken: The family, including Zack (second right) are now trying to come to terms with her death. Her eleven-month-old daughter Dixie, who was in the car at the time, is also pictured . Eric said he believes his daughter was distracted before driving into the back of the SUV, which had stopped at a traffic light. Its driver was not injured and the SUV was able to be driven from the scene. After the crash, she was able to talk and complained of pain to her stomach, likely from the steering wheel, airbag or seat belt, which she had been wearing. Friends  raised more than $2,300 for her funeral costs and children on a gofundme page. The last post, written two months ago, read: 'The family is very thankful for every penny that is donated to help with the cost of the funeral plus this is helping towards the beautiful twins that will have to stay in the hospital for another six to eight weeks.'","Ashton Hughes crashed into a stopped SUV after a doctor's appointment .

"Discarded wet wipes are blighting Britain’s shores – with a 50 per cent rise last year in the number found. An average of 56 wipes per mile were retrieved in the Marine Conservation Society’s annual clean-up of some 300 beaches. It also found a sharp rise in litter overall in parts of the UK. Rubbish on some beaches in the South West increased by 89 per cent in 2014 compared with the year before, the MCS found. An average of 56 wipes per mile were retrieved in the Marine Conservation Society’s annual clean-up of 300 of Britain's beaches . Popular holiday destinations in Cornwall were among the worst, including Porthpean, Porthtowan, Gwithian and Gunwalloe Fishing Cove. The MCS complained that wet wipes – which are being used to remove make-up, replace toilet paper and apply fake tan – do not disintegrate like toilet paper, which means they survive being flushed or thrown away. Earlier this year, Southern Water revealed more than 2,000 tons of wet wipes were playing havoc with sewers in Kent. Research for United Utilities in the North West showed one in ten households have had blocked toilets and drains due to baby wipes and make-up wipes. Charlotte Coombes of the MCS said the wipes should be thrown in the bin, not down the toilet, adding: ‘Our sewerage systems weren’t built to cope with wet wipes … they typically contain plastic so once they reach the sea they last for a very long time. ‘They can cause blockages in our sewers, then everything else that has been flushed down the loo can either back up into people’s homes, or overflow into rivers and seas. ‘Overflows also happen during excessive rainfall, or if the plumbing hasn’t been connected up properly, meaning the wrong pipes are heading straight to the sea. That’s when we find sewage-related debris, including wet wipes, on the beach.’ Plastic bottles and aluminium cans made up 10 per cent of the litter found in the MCS clean-up in September. The charity called for the introduction of a refund of 10p-30p for containers that are returned for recycling. Volunteers also came across bizarre items including a plastic hand, a colostomy bag, a piping nozzle, and on one beach, nine pairs of shoes. The MCS found an average of 3,955 bits of litter per mile in 2014, up 6.4 per cent on the year before. Welsh beaches were the dirtiest with an average of 10,360 rubbish items per mile.","56 wet wipes per mile of beach retrieved in annual clean-up of 300 beaches .

"If you're looking for the ultimate Easter egg-stravaganza, London's Studio Kitchen at K West Hotel have obliged, with a sweet treat inspired by one of our most popular chocolates. But if the thought of a Crème Egg Burger has your tastebuds recoiling at the horror of a meat patty slathered in crème egg filling, relax - this burger is made entirely from confectionery. And this Frankenstein food - created specially for Easter by chefs in the Studio Kitchen burger lab, K West Hotel & Spa in Shepherds Bush, West London - will be available throughout spring. Scroll down for video . The Crème Egg Burger is more sweet treat than meat feast, with chocolate covered brioche buns, a melted chocolate Crème Egg 'patty', plus strawberry jam filling and lashings of mascarpone cream . Sure to send sugar levels soaring, the mini slider burgers see a gooey melted crème egg playing the part of the patty, slathered in 'ketchup' made from strawberry jelly and sitting on a bed of thickly spread mascarpone cream. Then of course, there are the buns. Slices of sweet brioche, the top layer is dunked in melted white chocolate for a thorough coating, before being sprinkled with colourful hundreds and thousands. More sweet treat that meaty feast, the burgers have gone straight to the top of the Studio Kitchen dessert menu, priced at £5.50 for a portion of two. Served from the end of March 2015 and throughout spring in celebration of Easter, the burgers also appear in the hotel's decadent Spring Rocks Afternoon Tea. The Easter creation follows public outrage over the change in chocolate recipe for classic Cadbury's Crème Eggs. Changes to the classic Dairy Milk chocolate recipe used in Cadbury Crème Eggs sparked public outrage in January, as shoppers were told a sweeter 'standard cocoa mix chocolate' would be used instead this year . A spokesperson for Cadbury, bought by American giant Kraft in 2010, revealed back in January that the nation's favourite chocolate egg will no longer be coated in Dairy Milk. An official announcement stated, 'It’s no longer Dairy Milk. It is similar, but not exactly Dairy Milk.' Chefs at the Studio Kitchen aren't the first to turn Britain's best-loved Easter treat into a new concoction. In 2013 a flury of alcoholic cocktails appeared in bars and clubs, mixing the gooey centre and melted chocolate  with spirits and liquor. While The Mint Bar at Ireland's Westin Dublin Hotel served a Creme Egg Cocktail, London's Jewel Bar in Piccadilly Circus mixed-up a chocolatey Creme Egg mojito, which contained almost 1,000 calories. In 2013 The Mint Bar at Dublin's Westin Dublin Hotel served the limited edition Creme Egg Cocktail, mixing vanilla infused Grey Goose Vodka and chocolate-bean flavoured Crème De Cacao, with white chocolate liqueur, cream and mini Cadbury Crème Eggs .","Crème Egg Burger has been created by chefs at London hotel 'burger lab'

"A bear came tumbling out of a tree on Wednesday in Tracy, California after being stuck in the branches for over two hours and it was later safely released back into the wild.

On Monday, a Tracy resident snapped a photo of a bear near Grantline and Corral Hollow roads. The female bear caught on Wednesday was safely released into the wild on Wednesday night . Mystery: It's a bit of a mystery as to how the bear ended up in Tracy since there are no near forests or mountains that are typically considered a bear's habitat . Rescue: The California Department of Fish and Wildlife transported the bear to a safer environment . Safe release: The bear was released into the wild at 2:00 AM on Wednesday night .","Onlookers gasped as the 175-pound bear fell several feet after California Fish and Wildlife officers shot the female with four tranquilizer darts .

"A vigilante mother found guilty of assaulting two schoolgirls after she suspected one of them had upset her daughter has said she is 'not a chav or a thug'. Joanne Higgs, 33, was spared jail after  punching and pushing Lilly Hulse, 13, and Dominique Nash, 15, who had intervened to help the younger girl. The mother-of-three claims her daughter Demi Knox, was subjected to an online bullying and harassment campaign at the hands of teenagers from Middleton Technology School, Manchester. Joanne Higgs (pictured with her daughter Demi) was found guilty of assaulting two teenage girls . She said she was also forced to remove her daughter from the school after she was badly beaten up in the school grounds. Miss Higgs, from Middleton, said: 'I know what I did was wrong but I'm not a thug or a chav. 'I acted on how I was feeling at that time. 'I don't think I am the victim – it's my daughter who has been the victim in all this. 'She's had a nightmare.' Bury Magistrates Court heard that she and two unknown men set upon the girls in April last year. The girls were said to have been punched to the ground. Dominique Nash, 15, was attacked by mother-of-three Higgs in the street and was left with a black eye . Dominique, now 16, said she had been trying to protect her friend from attack when she was punched . But Miss Higgs – who took to a local newspaper's Facebook page to defend her actions - said she acted on her own and that no other adults were involved. She told the Manchester Evening News she took action into her own hands after a gang of teenagers gathered outside her home and started throwing eggs at her house. She said: 'I had tried to call the police to tell them about it. 'These kids were taunting me in the street, they were hanging round my house. There were shouting abuse at me and my daughter. 'I had tried to resolve it with the school and some of the parents after the fight but had no joy. 'I just wanted them to stop harassing my daughter. She'd already suffered enough. But the mother-of-three claims her daughter Demi Knox, was subjected to an online bullying and harassment campaign at the hands of teenagers from Middleton Technology School . 'On April 1, I came home from work and there were 15 kids outside. 'My two other children were inside and they screaming. 'The kids were threatening to smash my windows. I called the police but they never came. 'I just wanted it all to stop once and for all.' Miss Higgs was given a suspended sentence of 15 weeks for each assault and ordered to pay compensation to the victims. She added: 'I want to put all this behind me. 'All I want is peace my daughter and my family. Demi has had no happy years at school.' Middleton Technology School said the school was 'dismayed and disgusted that our students were attacked in this way by an adult.'","Joanne Higgs, 33, attacked two girls, aged 13 and 15 .

"Elizabeth Webber Harris is the only woman to ever be 'awarded' the Victoria Cross . On the Indian frontline in 1869, Elizabeth Webber Harris risked her life to nurse soldiers hit by a deadly cholera outbreak back to health. As the only woman serving alongside the Bengal Fusiliers in Peshawar, she saved more lives with her ‘tender consolations’ than a surgeon did with his medicines. Her bravery and selfless devotion earned her an honorary Victoria Cross – making her the only woman to ever be ‘awarded’ the highest military honour in Britain. With women ineligible to receive the Victoria Cross until 1921, she was never officially recognised for her efforts. But her regiment were so struck by her ‘indomitable pluck’ that, after obtaining Queen Victoria’s special permission, they had a replica gold VC made for her. And as no woman has been awarded the honour since 1921, Mrs Harris’s unofficial medal makes her the only female recipient. The remarkable story of her life emerged in detail for the first time yesterday, as her gold medal is set to go on display at the Imperial War Museum in London next month. Speaking about her heroic efforts, Lord Ashcroft, who owns the medal, said: ‘Elizabeth Webber Harris was a remarkable woman who risked her own life to save others with her selfless devotion in nursing the sick. ‘She was both courageous and inspirational in the manner in which she dealt with a cholera outbreak in India in 1869.’ He added that the officers of the 104th Bengal Fusiliers, who presented her with the replica, ‘summed it up perfectly when they said the award was for her “indomitable pluck”’. Born in Kent in 1834, she married Webber Harris, a captain in the 2nd Bengal Fusiliers – later renamed the 104th – in 1859. Women were ineligible for the Victoria Cross until 1921, but Queen Victoria gave permission for a gold replica to be made for Mrs Harris to reward her for her ‘indomitable pluck' In October 1868, the newly-promoted Major General Harris took the 104th to Peshawar, having anticipated trouble on India’s north-west frontier. However, in 1869 cholera swept India and by August the soldiers were infected. On September 17 part of the regiment went to a temporary camp in the countryside, with the remaining soldiers joining them five days later. By then, many soldiers and their families had already died from the disease and Mrs Harris was the only woman to go with them. In her mid-30s at the time, she spent three months nursing the sick and keeping up their spirits, moving through the baking Indian countryside to take care of the regiment as they moved stations. Mrs Harris (gravestone pictured) spent three months nursing soldiers with cholera and keeping up an Army regiment's spirits . Even with her own life in danger, Mrs Harris did not stop her efforts to help the men beat the disease. One night she was attacked by two tribesmen who seized her horse in an incident she described as ‘alarming’. When the regiment finally returned to Peshawar, she said: ‘I was treated as a heroine’. At a regimental dinner in 1869, one member of the 104th said: ‘The Surgeon of the Regiment declared that by her energies and tender consolations, she had been the instrument of preserving more lives than he had been able to save with his medicines.’ Her husband added: ‘None of those who were with the Regiment during that awful cholera season in 1869 will ever forget Mrs Harris’s devotion to the sick.’ In June 1921 a magazine article said: ‘Throughout their trying time in the isolation camp Mrs Harris remained with the regiment and it was largely owing to her indefatigable exertions that the losses of the regiment were not infinitely heavier than they were.’ The 104th officers felt Mrs Harris had lived up to the traditions of the Victoria Cross and in 1869 she was awarded with the honorary medal. A letter to the Times stated: ‘It is said that it was suggested to Queen Victoria that Mrs Webber Harris might be given the Victoria Cross, but this was, of course, not possible, so the gold replica was made and presented to her instead.’ Mrs Harris later wrote: ‘It is a most beautiful ornament, and will always be my most cherished possession.’ She died in London in 1917. Her medal will be displayed at the IWM from next month in celebration of International Women’s Day, which was held on Sunday.","Elizabeth Webber Harris risked her life nursing soldiers back to health .

"Robots will use humans as pets once they achieve a subset of artificial intelligence known as 'superintelligence'. This is according to SpaceX-founder Elon Musk who claims that when computers become smarter than people, they will treat them like 'pet Labradors'. His comments were made in a recent interview with scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who added that computers could choose to breed docile humans and eradicate the violent ones. Scroll down for video and audio . SpaceX-founder Elon Musk (right) says robots will someday treat humans like pets.In a recent interview with scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson (left), Musk said his fears revolve around 'superintelligence' Musk: 'I mean, we won't be like a pet Labrador if we're lucky,' Musk said. Tyson: 'A pet Lab' Musk: 'I have a pet Labrador by the way.' Tyson: 'We'll be their pets.' Musk: 'It's like the friendliest creature.' Tyson: 'No, they'll domesticate us.' Musk: 'Yes! Exactly' Tyson: 'So we'll be lab pets to them.' Musk: 'Yes. Or something strange is going to happen.' Tyson: 'They'll keep the docile humans and get rid of the violent ones. Musk: 'Yeah.' Tyson: 'And then breed the docile humans.' Listen to the full interview here. Elon Musk has already likened artificial intelligence to 'summoning the demon'. But in his latest interview, Musk said his fears revolve around something known as superintelligence. This, according to author Nick Bostrom, is 'any intellect that greatly exceed the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest.' 'I mean, we won't be like a pet Labrador if we're lucky,' Musk told Tyson, adding that we may become lab pets to them. Tyson theorised that robots will 'Get rid of the violent ones...And then breed the docile humans'. Musk also said humanity needs to be careful about what it programs superintelligent robots to do. He uses the example of asking them to find out what makes people happy. 'It may conclude that all unhappy humans should be terminated,' Musk said. 'Or that we should all be captured with dopamine and serotonin directly injected into our brains to maximise happiness because it's concluded that dopamine and serotonin are what cause happiness, therefore maximise it.' Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, this week made similar comments during an interview with Paul Smith at Australian Financial Review. The 64-year-old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human-like computers could be a dangerous reality. Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, this week made similar comments. The 64-year-old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human-like computers could be a dangerous reality. He asked: 'Will we be the gods? Will we be the family pets? Or will we be ants that get stepped on?' He quipped: 'Will we be the gods? Will we be the family pets? Or will we be ants that get stepped on?' 'Computers are going to take over from humans, no question,' he added. 'If we build these devices to take care of everything for us, eventually they'll think faster than us and they'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently. He also directly referenced warnings issued by both Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking about the threat AI has on humanity. They are part of a group of experts, known collectively as the Future of Life Institute, who recently drafted an open letter saying scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. 'Computers are going to take over from humans, no question,' said Wozniak. 'If we build these devices to take care of everything for us, eventually they'll think faster than us and they'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently. Aldebaran's human-like robot is pictured . The authors said there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. Earlier this month Tesla boss Mr Musk said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will, instead, be controlled by robots. The entrepreneur claimed that computers will one day do a much better job of driving and that humans are simply 'too dangerous' behind the wheel. The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair (pictured) or a floor-level bed to a bath, for example . A recent report by management consulting firm Boston Consulting Group predicted by 2025 the number of 'automatable' tasks will rise to 25 per cent. This will lead to robots replacing many human jobs - and is a trend that has already begun in Japan. Earlier this week Riken-SRK Collaboration Centre for Human-Interactive Robot Research in Nagoya, Japan unveiled its latest Robear. The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but has enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor-level bed to a bath. It weighs 309lb (140kg) with extending legs that stop the 'bear' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms. And at the start of the month, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said it will begin employing a humanoid called Nao in its branches from April, on a trial basis. And if the trial is successful, the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the Japanese bank by 2020. Elsewhere, in China there is a hotel manned entirely by robots. From reception desk staff to security doormen and waiters, the Pengheng Space Capsules Hotel in Shenzhen, China, has built, rather than hired, new employees. Start-up costs and robot maintenance aside, staff bills are minimal and the hotel can pass these savings back to the customer as a night's stay costs just £6.80 per night.","Comments  made in an interview with scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson .

"Charles Baker, who has been arrested for a raping a woman at gunpoint after a rape kit from 2000 was finally tested . Police in Memphis have identified 25 rape suspects after finally testing evidence kits that had been forgotten about for 40 years. Some rape victims have sued the city, alleging that the failure to test around 12,000 kits, some dating back to the 1970s, has allowed too many rapists to escape prosecution. The kits contain samples of semen, saliva and blood taken from a victim, with the DNA then uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System to check for a match. Now it has been revealed that the backlog, which is now being cleared, has identified 25 suspected rapists with 16 of them believed to have assaulted multiple victims. Memphis Police Lieutenant Cody Wilkerson also confirmed that 5,386 kits had now been sent for testing and that 58 cases have been sent to prosecutors for indictment. However, he added dozens of investigations have been cut short because of statutes of limitations on rape charges, or the deaths of victims or suspects. It comes after it emerged last month that accused rapist Charles Baker, who allegedly assaulted a woman at gunpoint, had finally been arrested after a backlogged rape kit was tested. Baker, 44, was charged with aggravated rape after the attack in Memphis 15 years ago. He is accused to have abducted the victim at gunpoint in 2000 in downtown Memphis and raped her. The woman then consented to a rape kit test but the evidence wasn't tested by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation until July 2012. It was then revealed that the DNA then matched that of Baker earlier this year. In a report about the kit testing backlog last year, former U.S. Attorney Veronica Coleman-Davis said nobody maliciously or wantonly allowed the kits to remain untested. Instead she attributed the problem to 'a general and collective failure to understand the importance of DNA testing as was reflected in common practices in place locally and nationwide.' The kits contain samples of semen, saliva and blood taken from a victim, with the DNA then uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System to check for a match . Meanwhile in February, officials in Houston said evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested there for years has turned up 850 hits in the FBI's nationwide database of DNA profiles. And in Detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009. In Cleveland, prosecutors have also sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing.","Memphis has started testing rape evidence kits that had been backlogged .

"In of deadliest and most destructive storms in U.S. history, when the storm hit, photographer Randy Taylor, 59, lost more than 30 years worth of photography work. The 59-year-old had photographed some of the biggest stories of the 20th Century (from Princess Diana’s pregnancy to Mick Jagger’s relationship with Jerry Hall), but when Hurricane Sandy struck New York in October 2012, flooding Taylor’s entire storage facility, almost all of his work was destroyed.

It was like taking a snapshot of the picture in that damaged state. Taylor said the entire experience has 'been a roller coaster of emotions.' ‘[It] started off as a sense of total loss and devastation. But ultimately this has been a wonderful experience; a lot of great art came out of it and I'm happy with what was saved.' Taylor, from New York, USA, has enjoyed an amazing career that has seen him cover some of the most dramatic events of the 20th and early 21st Century.

I had the honor of being nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for that one. 'I then traveled around the world and I covered all kinds of major stories, celebrations, politicians, sporting events - it was an amazing era. 'I had done a number of travels with the Pope, I had covered the Olympics in Moscow, the World Cup in Argentina, and the invasion of Grenada.'

He said: 'There was 300 square feet of storage and everything had been floating for a while and then had sunk down to the bottom. 'Thirty years of my life was down the drain and gone and it had a big impact on me. 'There was also the loss of my family's legacy. I was designated as the family archivist and told my family to give me their pictures so I could take care of them and restore them.' To recover his work, Taylor first attempted to wash them, but found it washed away the emulsion leaving a blank negative. He then dipped them in rubbing alcohol to clean off the mold and halt the deterioration. It also resulted in giving them a new psychedelic appearance.

"A woman raised by two lesbians has provoked controversy after publicly announcing that she is against gay marriage because she says she missed out on having her father in her life when growing up. Heather Barwick, a 31-year-old mother-of-four from South Carolina, says her mother left her father when she was 2 or 3 so that she could move in with the woman she loved. 'Gay community, I am your daughter. My mom raised me with her same-sex partner back in the '80s and '90s,' writes Barwick for the conservative publication The Federalist. Heather Barwick, a 31-year-old mother-of-four from South Carolina, says she is against gay marriage because she missed out on having her father around when she was growing up . 'I'm writing to you because I'm letting myself out of the closet: I don't support gay marriage. But it might not be for the reasons that you think. It's not because you're gay. I love you, so much. It's because of the nature of the same-sex relationship itself.' Barwick recalls growing up in a very liberal and open-minded suburb surrounded by a 'tight-knit community of gay and lesbian friends' and says her mother's partner 'treated me as if I was her own daughter'. She also admits that her biological father 'wasn't a great guy,' and 'didn't bother coming around anymore.' Despite being an advocate for gay marriage in her 20s, Barwick now says she's had a change of heart. 'Same-sex marriage and parenting withholds either a mother or father from a child while telling him or her that it doesn't matter. That it's all the same. But it's not,' she writes. 'A lot of us, a lot of your kids, are hurting. My father's absence created a huge hole in me, and I ached every day for a dad. I loved my mom's partner, but another mom could never have replaced the father I lost.' Abigail Garner, an LGBT family-rights educator and author of the book Families Like Mine: Children Of Gay Parents Tell It Like It Is, who was raised by two dads, told Yahoo Parenting that Barwick's reasoning didn't make much sense. 'While I sympathize with Heather's pain caused by being abandoned by her heterosexual father, her pain has nothing to do with same-sex marriage,' she said. 'We are all entitled to our personal narratives, but I strongly disagree with Heather's contrived attempt to offer her personal story as a case for blocking other families' access to marriage rights.' Speaking to Christian publication World, Barwick said she only found healing for her 'father wound' after she began attending church with her future husband. 'It really wasn't until I came to Christ that I felt that burden lifted off of me. And I'm not bitter. I'm not angry,' she said. 'I forgive my dad.' Barwick said there had been long-term consequences to going up with two mothers. 'I'm not gay, but the relationship that was modeled before me was a woman loving a woman. So I've struggled as an adult figuring out how to be in a relationship with my husband.' Barwick is also one of six people raised by gay parents who signed a public letter of support this week for designers Dolce & Gabbana following their controversial statements about gay parents.","Heather Barwick says she is against gay marriage because she missed out on having her father around when she was growing up .

The 1,000lb explosive was transported to the site in Kent, owned by Brett Aggregates, inside a skip packed with sand and loaded onto a lorry, which was flanked by police yesterday. The area in Bermondsey, Southwark, which was severely bombed during the Blitz in the Second World War, was put into lockdown from Monday night. It is believed the bomb was dropped over London by the Luftwaffe on 11 May 1941 but unusually did not detonate. More than 1,200 people were evacuated from their homes following the discovery by builders working on the construction site of the former Southwark Irish Pensioners centre. A police cordon sealed off 200 metres of land surrounding the bomb site for 32 hours as the Army built a bunker around the bomb to safely defuse it. The  teams, who had previously worked on Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, used Hesco blast walls, like those used to build Camp Bastion and other military bases in Afghanistan during the conflict there. A soldier in charge of removing it has revealed that if the bomb had exploded it could have led to 'major loss of life' and significant damage to buildings. Senior Ammunition Technician John Lester said it was a 'a live munition in a dangerous condition' which had to be taken far from the city before it could be safely destroyed. SAT Lester, of 11 EOD, Royal Logistic Corps, said: 'This bomb was a live munition in a dangerous condition. It had been disturbed by some pretty heavy building machinery, which is never a good thing. Bombs don't like being bashed around. 'But once we'd uncovered it, we knew what we were dealing with and it was just a question of solving the puzzle quickly so we could get it away and the good residents of Bermondsey back in their homes. 'We knew we had to get it away to dispose of it safely because trying to deal onsite with a bomb that size, even under a controlled explosion, would cause significant damage to buildings, (and) property, and the risk of major loss of life in such a highly populated part of the city was very high.' Proud: The soldiers from 11 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) Regiment Royal Logistics Corps stand in the hole left behind after the explosive was blown up . The Ministry of Defence said it had had reports that this morning's explosion at Cliffe in Kent (the quarry before, left, and during, right) could be heard 10 miles away. These pictures show the devastating effects the bomb could have had if it was accidentally detonated in London . SSgt Clinton and Sgt McKinnon carry spades to the site of the quarry, where two kilogrammes of high explosives were used to blow it up . The authorities warned that 'remaining in your home is placing your life at significant risk' and residents were forced out of their homes on Monday night. Around 80 people were re-homed in hotels or empty council accommodation, while others had to sleep at houses of friends and family. Hot meals and tea and coffee were provided for nearly 70 people at the Seven Islands Leisure Centre and Canada Water Library during the day. Scotland Yard confirmed at around 6pm  that the area was deemed safe and residents could return to their homes. Residents were commended for their 'Blitz spirit' by local councillor Lucas Green, who referred to the residents as the 'evacuees of 2015', and said they had a mass phone charger swap', which was 'the modern day cup of sugar'. Cllr Peter John, Leader of Southwark Council has thanked the emergency services, St Johns Ambulance and the Red Cross for their support at the rest centres. He added: 'Thankfully we don't have to deal with unexploded bombs very often, but we do have plans in place to deal with such emergencies, and they work. Once again I want to thank residents for their patience and co-operation while the army and police carried out their work.' Transported: The fuse on the unexploded bomb was made safe by experts before it was loaded onto a lorry inside a skip filled with sand . Discovery: A Royal Logistic Core Bomb disposal expert checking the fuse on the Luftwaffe Sprengbombe-Cylindrisch bomb at the site in Bermondsey, south London . Destruction: A soldier in charge of removing it has revealed that if the bomb had exploded it could have led to 'major loss of life' and significant damage to buildings . Dartford Police warned residents in Kent that there would be a loud explosion this morning but they needn't panic. The Ministry of Defence said it had had reports that this morning's explosion could be heard 10 miles (16km) away. Writing on Twitter, they said: 'EXPLOSION: Plz don't panic if you hear a loud bang... Army due to safely detonate a WWII UXB discovered in London yesterday.' Residents reported hearing a loud bang after the explosion at around 9am claiming it 'rattled' houses. Andy B posted on social media: 'Massive bang heard in Meopham, house shaken!!'. On The Thames said: 'Judging by the massive bang and thud just then in Kent, I'd say the #Bermondseybomb is no more!'. Residents were evacuated on Monady night after the 1,000lb German ordnance was discovered by builders under the old site of the Southwark Irish Pensioners. Pictured: Bomb disposal experts excavate the device . A bunker was built around the bomb by Royal Engineers of 33EOD to protect the surrounding buildings in case of accidental detonation. It was created from Hesco blast walls, like those used to build Camp Bastion and other military bases in Afghanistan during the conflict there .","A controlled explosion of the Second World War bomb was carried out in a quarry in Cliffe, Kent, this morning .

"These stunning images show the bustling heart of New York in the middle of the 20th century - and how times have changed in the city. Pictures taken in the 1940s and 1950s by legendary crime photographer Arthur Fellig, better known as Weegee, are shown alongside shots of the same areas captured this month. They include an image of a man lying drunk next to the former police department headquarters on Center Street in 1945 - and the same spot 70 years later. A man is pictured lying drunk on the ground on Center Street in a 1945 picture called 'Derelict sleeping on the sidewalk outside police headquarters' (left). A woman walks past the same engraved sign for the former Police Department on March 18 this year (right) A lightning bolt strikes above Lower Manhattan on July 27, 1940 (top) in a picture taken by legendary crime photographer Arthur Fellig. A picture taken from the same vantage point (bottom) shows how the skyline has changed over the last 75 years . Bright lights: Weegee's photograph 'Neon billboards on Times Square' (top), taken in September 1957, and an image taken from the same spot earlier this month (bottom) shows how the area has changed over the years . A 1940 photo of Lower Manhattan, shot at night from across the river near the Brooklyn Bridge, is dominated by a mere three skyscrapers, a shocking contrast to the forest of towers now surrounding 1 World Trade. A 1946 image shows a fire in a loft building at Fulton and Greenwich streets. The intersection would be unrecognizable to Weegee today: It's the site of the 9/11 Memorial and museum. A 1952 picture shows the stately, pristine stone facade of One Times Square, where a spire on the roof is still used for the New Year's Eve ball drop. Today the building's exterior is covered with billboards. But Weegee's 1957 view of Times Square does show neon ads, including now-outmoded brands like Admiral TV appliances alongside still-familiar names like Budweiser. Then and now: Shops and businesses have sprung up along Doyers Street in the heart of New York's Chinatown (bottom). Weegee photographed a fire on the same street (top) on January 17, 1941 . Weegee photographed The Empire State Building in 1943 (left) from behind a 'loans sign'. A picture taken this month (right) shows how the view from the same spot has changed in the last 70 years . Arthur Fellig (pictured) went by the pseudonym Weegee, derived from a Ouija board - chosen for his ability to arrive at crime scenes before police . He was the photojournalist who prowled the streets of New York, capturing crime scenes and revelling in his own notoriety. Arthur Fellig went by the pseudonym Weegee, derived from a Ouija board - chosen for his ability to arrive at crime scenes before police. He is credited with setting a new standard for tabloid photojournalism with his distinct and dramatic black and white street photography. He started out as a Hollywood paparazzo but his talents eventually landed him freelance jobs for a variety of New York newspapers and photo agencies. In a 2006 article entitled 'Unknown Weegee, on Photographer Who Made The Night Noir', New York Times reporter Holland Cotter described his technique. 'He prowled the streets in a car equipped with a police radio, a typewriter, developing equipment, a supply of cigars and a change of underwear,' Mr Cotter wrote, dubbing Weegee a 'one-man photo factory'. 'He drove to a crime site; took pictures; developed the film, using the trunk as a darkroom; and delivered the prints.' Weegee was born Usher Fellig in Zlockzów, Austrian Galicia (now Ukraine), but his name was changed to Arthur when his family emigrated to New York in 1909. He became known for his obsession with the macabre with his stills of New York's crime-ridden Lower East Side, but eventually returned to his roots in Hollywood. His 1945 book of photographs, Naked City, was the inspiration behind the 1947 film of the same name and he was uncredited as a still photographer in the 1964 Stanley Kubrick film Dr Strangelove. He revelled in his own notoriety, stamping the back of his pictures with 'Credit Photo by Weegee the Famous'. Speaking of his archive, he once said: 'The easiest kind of a job to cover was a murder. The stiff would be laying on the ground. 'He couldn't get up and walk away or get temperamental.' He died in December 1968 at the age of 69. In 1980, his widow Wilma Wilcox formed The Weegee Portfolio Incorporated to create a collection of his works from the original negatives and his entire archive was donated to the International Center of Photography in New York in 1993. Flashback: Crowds of men gather next to what is now the Barclay's Center, in a picture taken on March 18, 1943 called 'Wartime rationing: retail butchers await arrival of meat' (top). The same area, next to the Atlantic Mall, is shown below as it appears today . Other photos, lined up with contemporary views of the same spot, are surprisingly unchanged - like a 1939 scene in Little Italy where small shops still line the sidewalks. A 1953 photo shows Humphrey Bogart on the marquee of the Victory movie theater, home now to the New Victory, which specializes in children's entertainment. The Weegee photographs appear in a new guidebook, The Weegee Guide to New York, which includes never-before published work mostly drawn from the archives of the International Center of Photography. Most of the book's photos show ordinary neighborhoods and streetscapes with low-rise buildings, bulky cars, empty skies and remarkably uncluttered public spaces. Publishers Prestel say the book takes readers on 'excursions through Weegee’s stamping grounds, from the Bowery to Midtown, the West Side to the East, and with a little Brooklyn thrown in'. It adds that the photographs 'reinforce Weegee’s lasting vision of New York as a city both tough and resilient, a city that never sleeps.' Fellig moved to America from Eastern Europe as a child in 1909 and lived in the Lower East Side. As an adult, he went on to become a press photographer, famed for his pictures of urban life, crime and death. His nickname is said to have derived from a Ouija board - chosen for his ability to arrive at crime scenes before police.

A picture taken from the same vantage point shows the area as it appears today (right) The photos in the book are organized by neighborhood, with maps and locations for each, including which direction Weegee was facing when he took the picture. The information makes it easy to compare images with how the city looks today - either by walking around or by going on Google Street View. 'The classic New York skyline has changed dramatically since Weegee's day, and the flurry of often mundane building construction over the last decades has obscured many of New York's iconic skyscrapers,' said Philomena Mariani, director of publications at the International Center of Photography, who compiled the book with another ICP staff member, Christopher George. ICP owns 20,000 Weegee images, but for this book, Mariani said, 'We were looking for pictures that showed something of New York's built environment and public life,' including images of crowds gathered for celebrations and shoppers waiting for rationed goods. Mariani said she hopes the book will get people thinking not only about 'how different the urban landscape is physically,' but also about 'the public life that existed through the mid-20th century that Weegee captured.'

"Mike Fellows, head of Birmingham County FA, confirmed the allegations, and said any players found guilty will face serious consequences . A Christian football team has been forced to fold after players were accused of singing 'We're racist and that's the way we like it' in a changing room while a black referee was nearby. Pye Green Towers Football Club have disbanded after they were allegedly caught singing the chant, the same one the Chelsea supporters were recorded shouting on the Paris Metro last month. The players are said to have begun the chant while in the changing rooms of Eramus Darwin Academy in Burntwood, Stafforshire, while a black referee was getting changed next door. The official was so shaken by the incident that he called for a league official to provide support during the West Midlands Christian League match against Selly Oak Methodists last month. The Methodists won 3-1 but the result has since been declared as void. Last month Chelsea supporters were filmed in Paris, where their team were playing Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, bellowing the same song, while stopping a black man from boarding a busy Metro train. Birmingham County FA yesterday confirmed the accusations, which flies in the face of the  league's mission statement. The league was formed in 1979 'to enable Christian and non-Christian men alike to participate in a capably organised league in a manner, both on and off the field of play, that is morally, decently and ethically sound of action and speech and is honouring to the name of Jesus Christ'. Birmingham County FA discipline manager Mike Fellows said individuals found guilty of racism will face serious consequences. Any fine imposed will be divided up among individual players and club officials. Mr Fellows, an experienced referee himself, said: 'Incidents such as the one alleged here will not be tolerated, they will not be tolerated at all. 'They have no place in the game or our society. We have witnessed a rise in race and gender-related complaints. 'That does not mean more are taking place, it means individuals have more confidence in the way we tackle the issue and are coming forward. 'We will continue to prove that confidence is justified by hitting culprits hard, very hard indeed.' On its website, the league wrote: 'Following discussions between the League and Pye Green Towers, we can confirm that they have left the League with immediate effect. Pye Green Towers Football Club, which has historic associations with Pye Green Christian Centre (pictured), has now left the West Midlands Christian League . 'All League records will be expunged for this season regarding Division Two matches that they played in. Fixtures and league tables have already been adjusted accordingly.' League secretary Neil Kovacs said: 'I spoke to the club and they did agree that it was not acceptable. From a Christian point of view, it has no place in football and no place in society. 'We both agreed that the club's position in the league was untenable. They immediately folded the club. They made that decision.' The 54-year-old declined to go into detail about the incident, but admitted: 'Something did happen on the day which is now the subject of Birmingham County FA disciplinary procedure. 'The referee did go into the dressing room and say it was not acceptable. 'He has thanked the league for the support offered on the day and the support that followed. He is staying with us. We are honest and straightforward. The players were alleged to have used the same racist chant Chelsea supports were filmed using while pushing a black man off the Paris Metro last month . 'It is a shame that the good work - we have raised £14,000 in 10 years for charity - doesn't get reported, but this does.' A Pye Green Towers supporter, who does not wish to be named, argued the controversy has been blown out of proportion. He said: 'As I understand it, a player was trying to explain what he'd seen on YouTube.' Dave Spencer, of Pye Green Christian Centre, said his organisation has had no involvement with the football club for a number of years. He said: 'Historically, there was some involvement, but not now. There is no one from here who plays for the team or runs it.'","Players alleged to have chanted 'we're racist and that's the way we like it'

Investigation: They had both suffered 'extremely traumatic' injuries. Police have launched an investigation into the murders, but so far they have no suspects nor motive. Above, a deputy enters the cordoned-off property . However, investigators are reportedly looking at robbery as a possible motive after finding the grandparents' belongings strewn around their home and several drawers seemingly rifled through. Police were called to the property in the 6700 block of Pacific Crest Court after a neighbor checked on the Rentzs at the request of their two children, who had not heard from them for over a week. The neighbor had knocked on the couple's front door and received no response. When officers arrived at the scene at about 12.30pm, they apparently discovered the back door was unlocked. After entering the house, police found Mr and Mrs Rentz lying dead on the floor. They both had injuries that were consistent with violent beating deaths, officials said. Detective: 'Both of them had been there several days. It appears that they have both suffered from extreme trauma,' said Detective Ben Beall (pictured), adding that some drawers had apparently been rifled through .

"Experts have called for a 'turbocharged' campaign to rid the world of tobacco by 2040 . Leading experts have called for a 'turbocharged' global campaign to make the world tobacco free by 2040. The sale of tobacco should be phased out within the next 25 years, leading public health researchers have today said. They claim one billion deaths from smoking could be averted by the end of the century, if action is taken now. But a  global campaign will only work with the support of governments as well as with stronger evidence-based action against the tobacco industry, they warn. Professors Robert Beaglehole and Ruth Bonita, from the University of Auckland in New Zealand have called on the United Nations to lead efforts against the sale and consumption of tobacco. They warn that despite the decline of smoking in the developed world, tobacco use is expected to increase in some countries over the next decade, notably in Africa and the Middle East. With global population rising, there could still be more than a billion people smoking in 2025 unless urgent action is taken, it is claimed. The call to arms in the fight against smoking comes in a series of articles published in the Lancet medical journal and will be launched at the World Conference on Tobacco and Health being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Professor  Beaglehole,  said: 'The time has come for the world to acknowledge the unacceptability of the damage being done by the tobacco industry and work towards a world essentially free from the legal and illegal sale of tobacco products. 'A world where tobacco is out of sight, out of mind, and out of fashion - yet not prohibited - is achievable in less than three decades from now, but only with full commitment from governments, international agencies, such as UN and WHO (World Health Organisation), and civil society.' Global tobacco regulation should be 'turbocharged', with the United Nations taking a leading role in efforts to eliminate the sale and use of tobacco. The experts pointed out that falling demand for tobacco in rich parts of the world had caused the 'big four' tobacco companies to turn their attention to low and middle-income countries. Their alleged tactics included industrial litigation, lobbying through third-party groups, and covert maintenance of political pressure disguised as 'corporate social responsibility'. Professor Anna Gilmore, another of the authors from the University of Bath, said: 'Contrary to industry claims, tobacco marketing deliberately targets women and young people. 'The tobacco industry continues to interfere with governments' efforts to implement effective tobacco control policies. 'If the world is to become tobacco free, it's vital that the industry's appalling conduct receives far closer scrutiny and countries which stand up to the industry's bullying tactics receive better global support.' A decade on from the WHO's landmark introduction of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), just 15 per cent of the world's population have adequate access to smoking cessation services. Moreover, less than one in 10 people across the world are covered by tobacco taxation at levels recommended by the FCTC. The experts led by Professors Robert Beaglehole and Ruth Bonita, from the University of Auckland in New Zealand, said the sale of tobacco should be phased out within the next 25 years . That is despite research showing that increasing the cost of tobacco to consumers through taxation is one of the most effective ways to reduce consumption. In the last 10 years 50 million people have died as a result of tobacco use, indicating the FCTC alone is insufficient to achieve substantive reductions in the use of tobacco. While the implementation of the FCTC has been successful in some countries, particularly in Australia, New Zealand, Finland, the UK and some Pacific island countries, global action must now be taken. The authors note this can be achieved by accelerating the FCTC in those countries slow on the uptake. They said up until now too much focus has been on reducing the demand for tobacco. For further progress to be made, however, attention must turn to the supply, with greater regulation and closer scrutiny of the tobacco industry. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) said: 'Along with many other rich nations, we have made good progress in reducing tobacco use over the past several decades. 'However, one in five UK adults continue to smoke, not through choice but because they are addicted. 'And 100,000 die early each year as a result. 'The authors of the Lancet articles are right that we need to do more to tackle the tobacco industry and to make it pay for the damage it does. 'This is just what the tobacco levy currently being consulted on by HM Treasury could achieve. 'But it is essential that the money raised should be used to encourage smokers to quit and to discourage young people from taking up this deadly habit.'","Sale of tobacco should be phased out in the next 25 years, experts say .

"A garbage collector outside Atlanta has been sentenced to 30 days in prison for starting his work too early. Kevin McGill, 48, who works for Waste Management Inc, took a guilty plea deal after violating an ordinance in Sandy Springs, north of Atlanta, that bans collections before 7am. He turned 48 on Friday, but reported to a local jail at 6pm after being allowed to serve his time on the weekends so he can still work collecting wealthy residents' trash so he can support his wife and two children. The bin collector didn't have a lawyer when he was sentenced and has filed a motion to withdraw his plea, McGill's new attorney Kimberly Bandoh told Daily Mail Online. Kevin McGill, 48, will serve 30 days in jail  after pleading guilty to picking up trash in Sandy Springs, Georgia, before 7am . However, the Court Chief Solicitor Bill Riley asked for a 30 day sentence for the offense of picking up trash around 5am in the suburb and the judge granted the stiff penalty. He was sentenced on February 20th at the local courthouse, the running of which has been handed over to private contractors by the city. There were no real negotiations between her client and Mr Riley when he was sentenced, Ms Bandoh told Daily Mail Online, adding that the solicitor had claimed the offense meant 'automatic jail time'. Mr Riley has stood by the request for jail and says that 'fines don't seem to work' and 'The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail.' The solicitor said that residents of Sandy Springs, which include business executives for Delta Air Lines and other major companies, begin calling 9-1-1 when they hear early garbage men, according to WSPA. He said it was the right decision to punish McGill, who had only been on the route for three months, rather than his company, which the city has contracted to pick up its residents' trash. Sandy Springs solicitor Bill Riley said that it was the right decision to punish McGill, rather than his company, Waste Management . McGill is now working with lawyer Kimberly Bandon (pictured) and has filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea . The prosecutor said that early garbage collections are a nuisance to residents who want to sleep and that his office had met with Waste Management after previously punishing its employees for violating the ordinance. A representative for the company went to the courthouse with McGill, who expected to be ordered to pay up to a $1000 fine, Ms Bandoh said. Marla Prince, a spokesperson for for the company, told DailyMail Online that 'The incident with WM employee Kevin McGill is very unfortunate and we are currently working with WM Legal Counsel to resolve the situation'. She said she had not heard of a driver going to jail for a similar incident in the firm's South Atlantic area of Georgia and the Carolinas. Ms Prince added that Waste Management, which operates throughout the US and reported $14billion in revenue in 2014, would coordinate with its employee about his work schedule and jail time. Sharon Kraun, a spokesman for Sandy Springs, told Daily Mail Online that McGill's citation stemmed from an incident where his truck had been photographed by a resident. The city had seen a previous case where a garbage man was given jail time several years ago and that while no similar cases had happened since, the collectors had 'fair warning', Ms Kraun said. She said that Waste Management, which had amassed thousands of dollars in fines with the municipality in the last year, suspended McGill for violating its policies before he went to court. Waste Management could not answer questions about McGill's employment history with the company as of Saturday morning and said it was 'currently still investigating all the facts in the case'. Sandy Springs, a suburb that has seen residents such as business executives, Herman Cain and Akon, has contracted out most of its services, including the court system . His lawyer questioned the practice of going after  trash collectors personally. 'He's the employee. He's not the employer. Sentencing him to jail is doing what?' Ms Bandoh said. 'This is the most excessive punishment for an ordinance of this nature I've ever seen,' she said. McGill had never been to jail or even appeared in the court system, and no other charges factored into the judge's decision to give him jail time. He began serving his sentence last weekend for the February 5th citation and will continue losing his free time into the summer. Ms Bandoh said that the sentence was originally for 30 straight days before someone in the court spoke up and said that McGill should continue working and collecting the suburb's trash. 'I just want this to be over with,' McGill said, adding that he finds it hard to sleep in his hot jail cell. The worker was also sentenced to six months of probation, when he will pay fees to Sandy Springs, according to Vice. The suburb has privatized almost all of its city services, including its municipal courts, its communications, parks, economic development and call center operations. Its website states that 'this business model fosters a proactive, responsive and efficient approach to providing city services.' Residents of the area include professional athletes and rapper Akon, according to the New York Times.","Kevin McGill, 48, violated ordinance banning trash collection before 7am .

"A Ryanair pilot was forced to request police assistance after Danish workers surrounded the carrier’s first flight from Copenhagen to Dublin and prevented it from leaving, said airport officials. Passengers and crew were stranded for three hours as dozens of employees held a protest over Ryanair’s refusal to enter into a collective bargaining agreement with a union for pilot and flight attendants. Up to 60 employees, who demonstrated within Copenhagen Airport’s security perimeter, blocked the plane near one of the gates and prevented it from refuelling. Demonstrators put duct tape over their mouths and urged Ryanair workers to 'break the silence' Inside the terminal, demonstrators put duct tape over their mouths and held signs reading ‘Ryanair colleagues, break the silence, we have freedom to talk about our jobs’. Copenhagen Airports spokesman Soeren Nielsen told MailOnline Travel that the pilot asked airport officials to call police . He said: ‘We requested the police assistance on behalf of the Ryanair pilot … because there was a breach of safety rules and regulations. ‘We were in constant dialogue [with the pilot] throughout the three hours that the aircraft was here at the airport.’ Police responded to the airport and allowed the group to continue its protest. Deputy police inspector James Keiwe told Danish news agency Ritzau: ‘We have asked them to consider leaving the site and resolve the conflict in a different way. They were going to think about it. Outside the terminal employees blocked Ryanair's first flight from Copenhagen to Dublin . ‘We are very tolerant and patient at the Copenhagen police, so they must be given time for that.’ The protest came to an end about three hours later as the workers, who waved Danish flags, voluntarily dispersed. Ryanair said the protest was carried out by ‘non-Ryanair individuals’ and called on Danish authorities to prevent a repeat of the ‘unlawful blockade’. Protesters are upset that Ryanair is treating its Danish employees under Irish employment rules . Unrest has been building since October when Ryanair announced that it would be flying between Copenhagen and Dublin, London, Warsaw and Milan under Irish employment rules. Trade unions have taken legal action in a bid to force Ryanair to treat its workers at Copenhagen Airport under Denmark’s generous employment rules. Ryanair is planning to push ahead with plans for its Copenhagen base, although a ruling next week could lead to more demonstrations and further disruptions for the Dublin-based carrier. A Ryanair spokeswoman told MailOnline Travel: ‘This Ryanair flight from Copenhagen to Dublin was subjected to an unlawful blockade by non-Ryanair individuals at Copenhagen Airport and its departure was delayed by three hours. ‘We call on the relevant authorities to take all necessary action to prevent any repeat of this unlawful blockade and we remain committed to growing jobs, routes and tourism in Denmark, with the opening of our new Copenhagen base next week.’","Demonstrators are unhappy with Ryanair's treatment of employees .

"Boxer-turned-terrorist Mohamed Elomar is believed to have married fellow Australian Khaled Sharrouf's 14-year-old daughter. The girl's Twitter profile lists her 'zawji', Arabic for 'husband', as Abu Hafs Al Australi who is 17 years her senior. Abu Hafs Al Australi is the name used by Mohamed Elomar who fled to Syria to fight with Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Mohamed Elomar (above) has married the 14-year-old daughter of Khaled Sharrouf . Khaled Sharrouf's (above) daughter is believed to be 17 years younger than Elomar . The girl also seems to have a close association with the widows of 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif and Suhan Rahman who have recently died while fighting for the terror group. This revelation comes as a chilling new photograph of a young boy believed to be Sharrouf's son - and brother of the 14-year-old 'bride' - appeared on her social media site. The picture shows two children sitting in front of an Islamic State flag. Both are smiling and have rifles propped up next to them as they salute the camera. One of the children is believed to be Sharrouf's son. While the other boy is thought to be a Yazidi slave. This photo appeared on the girl's social media profile and features her younger brother. It is not clear who is her brother and who is the Yazidi slave . The girl asked God to protect her younger brother 'from all evil' on her social media account . One of the boys, who is holding a knife, also appears in the Twitter profile photo of 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif's widow Zehra Duman . Sharrouf posted a photo last year of his son holding up a severed head, causing international uproar . The caption read: 'Young cubs of ISIS [Islamic State of Iraq and Syria], may Allah (swt) protect them from all evil.' ISIS is another name for the terror group, IS. One of the children - who in a different photo appears to be holding a knife with a rifle in the background in the profile picture of 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif's widow Zehra Duman - seems to be a poster child for the extremist organisation. The latest photo has been posted after an active few days on Twitter for a group of Australian jihadists who are believed to have fled to the Middle East to fight with IS militants. Elomar also goes by the name of Abu Hafs Al Australi. The Sydney boxer fled to Syria to join IS . Mahmoud Adullatif, who is known as the 'Playboy Jihadi', died recently while fighting for IS . Zehra Duman (pictured above) was married to Abdullatif and has threatened Australia . The wife of Australian terrorist Suhan Rahman (above) also urged people to look up U.S. president Barack Obama's White House schedule and 'take down that treacherous tyrant' Just days ago, both Zehra Duman and the wife of Suhan Rahman made threats to Australia and Tony Abbott. 'Tony Abbott, I suggest u pin back ur ears, we're cumn to get u. And ur family. And the likes of u. Yous are not safe, even if yous think so,' Duman tweeted. Duman also warns that support for IS is growing 'within ur schools, work places, streets and r closer to u thn wat u think. Allah promised us victory and we will surely get it'. Meanwhile, the wife of Suhan Rahman called on supporters to send money to help the IS cause. Zumarul Jannah also urged people to look up U.S. president Barack Obama's White House schedule and 'take down that treacherous tyrant'. The same brown-eyed boy (front) appeared in another photo posted last year on Sharrouf's Twitter accounts . 'If you can send money to the Mujahideen [jihadis] here and you are able to assist a fighter dm me and send as much as you are able to,' the widow wrote. 'If you can't come here then terrorise the kuffar at home. Form and expand the Khilafah where you are.' Both Abdullahtif and and Rahman are believed to have died while fighting with IS. As a tribute to Rahman, Zumarul Jannah posted a photo of her husband's dead body last week with the caption: 'And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead.'","Khaled Sharrouf's daughter claims she is married to Mohamed Elomar .

"A new dating app claims to be 'putting the excitement back into dating' by pushing users' personalities ahead of their looks. Much like Tinder - the notorious dating app responsible for making 'swipe left' a cultural reference - FuzzyBanter can hook you up with people living in your area. But rather than have singles base their dating choices on potentially cringeworthy profile pictures, the app 'fuzzes' your face to let your listed interests do the matchmaking instead. New dating app FuzzyBanter blurs out profile pictures to let the listed interests and personality traits of its users become the the main attraction . All FuzzyBanter dating profile pictures are blurred to start off with (pictured right), though you can reveal what you look like further down the line. Age, height and ethnicity can still be used as search filters, to help people find their perfect match (pictured left) Claiming to 'bring courtship back to the 21st century', the app allows users to list up to ten interests when they sign up, along with a 160 character bio. You'll also need to enter your age, height, location, star sign and ethnicity, which can all be used as filters for potential dates to find what they're looking for. Once your vitals are in and your profile set up, you can search people by their proximity to you, just like on Tinder, and give anyone you like a thumbs up, or 'nudge'. If a person you've 'nudged' gives you a nudge back, congratulations, you've made a match and can now start messaging. Blending Facebook's Poke button with Tinder's swipe left or swipe right function, FuzzyBanter asks you to swipe right to 'nudge' a person you like. If they nudge you back, you have a match and can start chatting . Once you've reached the messaging stage with a potential date, this is where the fuzzy fun really begins. Though the idea behind the app is find matches based on your common interests and compatibility, singles don't have to agree to a blind date. Both participants have the option to either partially or fully reveal their profile picture, before anyone has shelled out for dinner or a drink. Found a FuzzyBanter match? Once you've started a conversation you can chose to reveal as much of your profile picture as you like, by altering the level of fuziness using the sliding scale . Stuck for words? The messaging feature in the dating app includes a long list of conversation templates, some far more flirty than others, to help even the shiest of daters get the ball rolling . Launching last night with a VIP bash in London, the app already has celebrity backing from the likes of Eastenders' Danny Dyer, actresses Lisa Faulkner and Angela Griffin, Apprentice winner Mark Wright, and TOWIE cast members Elliot Wright, Jessica Wright and James Argent. Founded by Allen James Scriven and Michael John Caine, FuzzyBanter is aimed at people aged between 18 and 45, looking for the perfect match. The app can even help you kick off the conversation if you're feeling a little shy, with a whole host of pre-written message templates. Eastenders star Danny Dyer showed his support for the new dating app, which rivals the already immensely popular Tinder, responsible for bringing 'swipe left' into common conversation . Lord Sugar's Apprentice 2014 winner Mark Wright has thrown his business initiative behind the new launch . Actress Angela Griffin was keen to share on Twitter how to app can help people find love based on more than just appearances .","New dating app FuzzyBanter offers alternative to looks-obsessed Tinder .

"Breast milk for sale on the internet can pose serious health risks, experts have warned. Milk sold online can be cheaper than from regulated milk banks, and is often bought by mothers who are unable to breastfeed, as well as cancer sufferers, fetishists and bodybuilders. Research published in the British Medical Journal said stricter regulation is needed as it could be potentially dangerous - especially for babies. Buying breast milk online - rather from a certified milk bank - can be dangerous, experts have warned . The report said women often feel pressurised by 'emotive, moralising discourse around breast feeding' and the belief that 'formula is inferior to human milk'. 'In the absence of warnings about the dangers of buying milk online, this option might seem healthy and beneficial - the better choice if one can't breast feed oneself,' it added. 'What mothers, and many healthcare workers, don't realise is that this market is dangerous, putting infant health at risk.' The report said milk should be screened for diseases, such as hepatitis B and C, HIV and human T cell lymphotropic virus and syphilis. Healthcare workers should be offered training on the online market so they can provide good advice and offer safe alternatives to new mothers, it added. Previous research has shown that milk purchased online has more bacterial growth due to lack of pasteurisation and poor shipping and storage. Buying breast milk online can pose health risks for babies, experts warn. Writing in the British Medical Journal, researchers said buying breast milk from the internet - rather than from certified milk banks - carries risks. Stricter regulation of online breast milk retailers is needed, they said. They added milk should be screened for diseases, such as hepatitis B and C, HIV and human T cell lymphotropic virus and syphilis. Healthcare workers should be offered training on the online market so they can provide good advice and offer safe alternatives to new mothers, they added. Previous research has shown that milk purchased online has more bacterial growth due to lack of pasteurisation and poor shipping and storage. One study showed that only nine out of 101 samples did not have bacterial growth. Others revealed that 25 per cent of milk samples were delivered with poor packaging and were no longer frozen, and had been contaminated with drugs and other substances. 'At present milk bought online is a far from ideal alternative, exposing infants and other consumers to microbiological and chemical agents,' the report led by the Global Health, Policy and Innovation Unit at Queen Mary University London concluded. 'Urgent action is required to make this market safer.' Selling the milk has become big business in the United States, and women in the UK are now increasingly offering up their surplus milk. Websites such as onlythebreast.co.uk offer a forum for mothers to sell or donate their milk, with headings such as 'Nuneaton; fatty, nutritious, healthy breast milk' and 'Dairy free breast milk for sale - Dagenham'. Sellers usually add a small profile about themselves with details such as whether they drink alcohol or caffeine, smoke or take drugs. It also features buyers' listings, with the biggest category by far headed 'men wanting milk'. It was set up in the US, where the original website appears to have many more users, but none are milk bank certified. Breast milk bought online has not been screened for diseases like HIV and hepatitis and can contain more bacteria, researchers said . Those wanting to give away their milk for free can also donate to one of 15 milk banks registered with the United Kingdom Association for Milk Banking charity, which donates breast milk to premature and sick babies. Other forums for sharing milk include a Facebook group, 'Human Milk 4 Human Babies'. Bodybuilders wanting to build up their muscles have also become keen consumers of breast milk, while many cancer sufferers have spoken about its benefits in building up their immune systems.","Selling breast milk online is big business in the US, and now increasing numbers of women in the UK are selling their surplus milk .

"A treasure trove of rare silver coins and jewellery that date from the reign of Alexander the Great have been discovered by cave explorers in northern Israel. The 2,300 year old treasures were found hidden in a narrow niche among pieces of broken pottery within the stalactite filled cave. They were spotted by three members of the Israeli Caving Club who had squeezed through the narrow passages at the entrance of the cave to explore inside. Scroll down for video . Silver coins dating from the time of Alexander the Great were found along side bracelets, rings and stone weights (all shown in the picture above) in a cave in northern Israel by members of the Israeli Caving Club . One of the spelunkers, Hen Zakai, spotted something shining on the cave floor. It turned out to be two ancient silver coins. Alongside the coins, the cave divers found a cloth pouch containing a handful of coins, rings, bracelets and earrings all made from silver and bronze. There may be dozens of treasure troves waiting to be uncovered around the world, according to a recent map. From the missing Irish Crown Jewels taken in 1907 to lost Fabergé Eggs and looted 16th century Peruvian gold, designers have plotted their rumoured locations on an interactive map. In addition to the real riches, the map also features the location of mythical and fictional treasure in books and films. There are seven Fabergé Eggs thought to be missing including the Royal Danish egg, made in 1903, and the Alexander III Commemorative egg produced in 1909. Their estimated value is $210 million (£137 million). Another missing treasure is the Amber Room panels, which were originally installed in Charlottenburg Palace. It is rumoured to have been stolen by the Nazis and remains hidden in Konigsberg, Germany. Elsewhere, in 1901 the SS Islander sank after hitting an iceberg off the coast of Alaska. It is thought to have contained $250 million (£163 million) worth of gold. Among the mythical treasure on the map is a stash of $300 million (£196 million) buried by Benito ‘Bloody Sword’ Bonito on the Cocos Island in Australia. Archaeologists who visited the cave at the weekend say the coins were minted at the beginning of the Hellenistic Period during the reign of Alexander the Great. They believe they may have been hidden in the cave by local residents who fled there during the unrest that broke out following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. It comes just a month after a chest filled with gold coins was discovered by divers off the coast of Caesarea, near Tel Aviv, Israel. Speaking about the latest discovery, a spokesman for the Israel Antiquities Authority said: 'The valuables might have been hidden in the cave by local residents who fled there during the period of governmental unrest stemming from the death of Alexander, a time when the Wars of the Diadochi broke out in Israel between Alexander’s heirs following his death. 'Presumably the cache was hidden in the hope of better days, but today we know that whoever buried the treasure never returned to collect it.' Mr Zakai had been exploring the cave, the exact location of which is being kept secret, with his father Reuven and their friend Lior Halony two weeks ago. The group had spent several hours exploring the narrow passages in the cave when Hen forced his way into a narrow niche and spotted the coins glinting in the light of his head torch. They reported the discovery to the Unit for the Prevention of Antiquities Robbery at the IAA. Officials and archaeologists then returned to the cave last weekend and found considerable evidence that the caves had been inhabited by humans. The coins were found in a cave in northern Israel alongside the agate gemstones and oil lamp pictured above . One of the coins found in the cave is pictured above and is thought to have been hidden by refugees during an ancient war following the death of Alexander the Great. The coin above features Zeus sitting with arm raised . Numerous pottery vessels were discovered in the cave and some had been there so long they had merged with the many stalactites that filled the cave. Archaeologists say some of the artifacts found in the cave date back to the Chalcolithic period more than 6,000 years ago. Some bronze items date back 5,000 years while there are others from the Biblical period 3,000 years ago and the Hellenistic period 2,300 years ago. On one side of  the coins is an image of Alexander the Great, while on the other side is an image of Zeus sitting on his throne, arm raised as if ready to wield his fearsome lightning bolts. Among the other items discovered were agate gemstones and an oil lamp. The Agate stones found in the cave, shown above alongside a Hellenstic oil lamp, were part of a bead necklace . Some of the coins discovered showed the image of Alexander the Great on one side (as shown above) while the other showed the image of Zeus sitting on his throne, which helped archaeologists date the treasure . The silver coins, rings and bracelets (shown above) are the first of their kind to be found from the period of Alexander the Great's rule over Israel, according to archaeologists who have examined the discovery . Archaeologists believe there may be more items to be found within the cave and intend to explore it further. Amir Ganor, director of the Unit for the Prevention of Antiquities Robbery commended the three members of the caving club for contacting the authorities about their discovery. In February the Israel Antiquities Authority announced that divers had found a chest filled with 2,000 gold coins dating back more than 1,000 years on the sea bed of the ancient harbour of Caesarea. Archaeologists say the coins, one of which is shown above, were crucial to dating the treasure discovered . The discovery comes just a month after divers found 2,000 gold coins (shown above) off the coast of Caesarea . The latest treasure trove was found in a cave in northern Israel while a previous discovery of 2,000 gold coins were found on the sea floor of the ancient harbour in Caesarea, just north of Tel Aviv and south of Haifa . He said: 'They understood the importance of the archaeological discovery and exhibited exemplary civic behavior by immediately bringing these impressive archaeological finds to the attention of the IAA. 'After the gold treasure from Caesarea, this is the second time in the past month that citizens have reported significant archaeological finds and we welcome this important trend. 'Thanks to these citizens’ awareness, researchers at the Israel Antiquities Authority will be able to expand the existing archaeological knowledge about the development of society and culture in the Land of Israel in antiquity.' A silver ring containing a crystal accumulation, shown above, was also among the items found in the cave .","Three members of the Israeli Caving Club found a pouch filled with silver .

"They used to say that when America sneezed, the world caught a cold, but this year, in the world of beauty at least, we’re all going to be catching the Korean bug. Because the newest, most exciting products all have a distinctly Eastern flavour. The Korean craze all began with BB creams — technically short for Blemish Balms, but essentially rebranded tinted moisturisers. ‘BB creams were big in Korea because the girls liked the cuteness of saying “BB cream”,’ explains Kathy Phillips, international beauty director for publisher Conde Nast’s Asian division. ‘There was nothing special about them, it was just another way of selling an existing product.’ The Korean cosmetic craze began with BB creams (Blemish Balms), which quickly became popular in Britain thanks to online promotions (pictured posed by model) But thanks to the internet, the trend quickly spread, and as soon as British brands saw an appetite for BB creams, they started bringing out their own. They also started to keep a close eye on what was happening in Korea. Because while BB creams were not much more than clever marketing, some genuine innovation is emerging. ‘There’s a big pharmaceutical industry there which the government has ploughed money into,’ says Kathy. ‘Cosmetic developments have come alongside it.’ So, among this year’s slew of Korean-influenced new products, which ones are worth looking out for? LANCOME MIRACLE CUSHION . Lancom Cushion Miracle Foundation . £29.50, nationwide . These cushion cosmetics are a huge hit in Korea, and Lancome is the first Western brand to launch a version. Essentially a sponge saturated with a light foundation, it comes inside a compact with a mirror and pad-style applicator. VERDICT: A brilliantly easy way to carry a liquid foundation around with you. It comes in six shades with refills costing £19.50. MAI COUTURE BLUSH PAPIER . Mai Couture Blush Papier . £12.50 for 50 sheets, thisisbeautymart.com . These papers, infused with a powder blush, come in three shades, from a golden apricot to sun-kissed bronze. Just pat the paper against your face — one sheet does both cheeks. VERDICT: If you’ve ever found your blusher in pieces after carting it around in your handbag, you’ll appreciate these. They make it incredibly simple to top up your blusher on the go. MASQUEBAR ANTI-WRINKLE SHEET MASKS . MasqueBar Anti-Wrinkle Sheet Masks . £9.99 for three, Boots . Masks are a huge Korean trend — from gel and fabric ones that make you look like Hannibal Lecter to conventional mud and cream varieties. These have give skin a serious dose of hydration. VERDICT: They really do boost hydration, temporarily erasing fine lines. ERBORIAN HERBAL ENERGY LOTION 30% . Erborian Herbal Energy Lotion 30% . £22.50, Selfridges . A collaboration between a Korean scientist and a French beauty obsessive, Erborian has been a beauty insider secret in the UK for a while. This lotion, based on Asian herbs, is designed to be used either as a toner, or with the cotton mask provided to create a mask. VERDICT: Delicately scented but not overpowering, if you’re looking for a new toner, this leaves skin soft, and hydrated. Ideal for those who don’t like the dewy finish. It also comes in six shades. SKINPEP AUTO MAKEUP . £29.99, skinpep.com . Hi-tech beauty gadgets are big news in Asia, so it’s no surprise that this South Korean brand offers a vibrating puff that promises a flawless finish for foundation. VERDICT: If you’re prone to ending up blotchy through applying foundation unevenly, this is a bit of a godsend. The puff is anti-microbial and vibrates around 12,000 times a minute to really work foundation into the skin, giving a dewy, natural and even result that a regular sponge or brush simply can’t compete with. THIS WORKS NO WRINKLES WONDER ESSENCE . This Works No Wrinkles-Wonder Essence . £30, thisworks.com . This is inspired by Korean ‘essences’ — water-based formulas that combine the properties of a toner, serum and moisturiser. Just pat a couple of drops on your face after cleansing. VERDICT: Many toners are alcohol-heavy and leave skin dry. This feels much gentler. It also contains hyaluronic acid, which attracts moisture to the skin. MIZON EGG WHITE BUBBLE CLEANSER . Mizon Egg White Bubble Cleanser . £19, cultbeauty.co.uk . This quirky brand offers a range of off-beat products boasting ingredients as curious as starfish extract and snail secretion. In that context, the eggshell membrane extract in this foaming cleanser seems pretty pedestrian. VERDICT: Weird ingredients aside, this has a clean, soapy scent. It removes grime without leaving skin tight or dry. FRINGE STABILISER . From around £1, ebay.co.uk . These simple but quirky hair accessories — basically the hook side of velcro, cut into heart or bow shapes — are used to hold hair off your face when washing or applying make up. You can also find them on Amazon. VERDICT: They might look like they’re designed for teenagers, but they’re quicker and easier than using a hairband or clip, and much less likely to mess up a blow dry.","The Korean craze all began with Blemish Balms or 'BB' creams .

"Lawyers for a transgender inmate convicted of murder asked the U.S. Supreme Court Monday to overturn a ruling denying her request for sex-reassignment surgery. A federal judge ordered the Massachusetts Department of Correction to grant the surgery to Michelle Kosilek in 2012, finding that it was the 'only adequate treatment' for Kosilek's severe gender dysphoria, also known as gender-identity disorder. That ruling was overturned in December by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Supreme Court appeal? Convicted murderer Michelle Kosilek, born Robert Kosilek, is fighting to overturn a ruling that denied her request for a sex-change surgery. Before and after pictures of Kosilek as a man on the left in 1990, and living as a woman on the right in 1993 . Lawyers with Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders told The Associated Press they asked the Supreme Court to grant a hearing or to reverse the ruling by the appeals court. They argue that the appeals court did not find 'clear error' in the judge's ruling granting the surgery and therefore had no legal basis to overturn it. Kosilek, born Robert Kosilek, is serving a life sentence for killing spouse Cheryl McCaul in 1990. Now 65, Kosilek has fought to get the surgery for two decades. In 2002, Judge Mark Wolf found that the treatment Kosilek was receiving in prison was inadequate, but stopped short of ordering the surgery, finding that the Department of Correction had not violated her Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment. Victim: Kosilek was convicted in 1990 of murdering her wife Cheryl McCaul (pictured) After that, prison officials began to provide hormone treatments, electrolysis to remove facial hair, female clothing and personal items. In 2005, Kosilek sued the Department of Correction again, arguing that the surgery was a medical necessity. In 2012, Wolf became the first judge in the country to order sex-reassignment surgery as a remedy for an inmate's gender-identity disorder. Courts in other states have ordered hormone treatments, psychotherapy and other treatments, but not surgery. Wolf found that the Department of Correction had violated the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment by providing inadequate medical care to Kosilek. A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Wolf's ruling, but the state appealed, citing security concerns about protecting Kosilek from sexual assaults if she completes her gender transition. She is currently housed in an all-male prison, but hopes to be transferred to the state's women's prison after the surgery. In December, a divided appeals court overturned the ruling by a 3-2 vote. Kosilek's lawyers argue that the appeals court overstepped its bounds and essentially re-tried the case. 'Their role is to defer to the trial judge on issues of fact,' said Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project of GLAD, the Boston-based legal group that brought the lawsuit that led to Massachusetts becoming the first state in the country to legalize gay marriage. 'The meaning of the Eighth Amendment is only as rich as its application, so those words that require prisons to provide adequate medical care are hollow if you have a district judge that makes the kind of careful fact findings that Judge Wolf did who is then reversed on appeal without a demonstration of the error in his facts,' Levi said. Kosilek's lawyers also argue that the Eighth Amendment prohibits prison officials from denying necessary medical treatment to an inmate for non-medical reasons, including security concerns. A message seeking comment was left Monday for the Department of Correction. It is unclear when the Supreme Court will decide whether to hear the case. The court receives between 7,500 and 8,000 new cases in a term and agrees to review roughly 1 percent of those appeals.","Michelle Kosilek, born Robert Kosilek, is currently imprisoned for murdering her wife Cheryl McCaul in 1990 .

"It's midnight, and I’m sitting by a fire swathed in Native American blankets - bourbon on ice clinking in one hand, the other incinerating plump saccharine marshmallows in the gentle flames. Native Americans in full traditional dress – one of them calls himself ‘Little Bear’ – are serenading our group with haunting songs. This is no inauthentic act cranked out for tourists, but a moving, thought-provoking reminder of an almost-lost American heritage. The Native Americans are not the only emblems of local culture to have been threatened. I am at Mustang Monument Wild Horse Eco-Resort, the creation and domain of the glamorous Madeleine Pickens, whose life’s work has been to preserve the last great American mustangs from oblivion. Standing proud: Mustang Monument is home to an impressive number of wild horses . She opened this resort last year, a 900-square-mile reserve and not-for-profit luxury eco-resort in northeastern Nevada. Former wife to oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens, and an ex-racehorse breeder,, Madeleine rescued 600 wild horses in 2008 after hearing that the government was planning to euthanise or sell more than 30,000 for slaughter. The animals encroach on federal land and so are rounded up at extortionate cost to the taxpayer. It was a prequel to setting up a foundation to save America’s Mustangs, whose conservation is battled over between those who consider the animal an agricultural pest, and those who believe it is a symbol of pioneer freedom. ‘The story of these wild horses unites people. We’ve created a playground that brings to life everything we imagined as children. But behind the fantasy, each guest is preserving a symbol of American heritage, and a symbol of freedom,’ as Madeleine puts it. This place is a reminder of days when games of 'Cowboys and Indians' were made possible by a bed-sheet tipi and faces streaked with lipstick. Home free: Some see wild mustangs as pests - but they are protected at this Nevada retreat . Madeleine’s version of playtime is a surreal blend of high fashion and authentic ranch life. Arriving at Mustang Monument – two hours drive from Salt Lake City and submerged within three mountain ranges – feels as though you are checking into the touristic lovechild of Anna Wintour and Butch Cassidy. Candy-coloured hand-painted tipis, pioneer wagons and a cinnamon-coffee blend of migrating horses punctuate the brush. Waking up on my first morning, a peachy glow floods through the painted canvas, a gentle way to greet the day and an unbelievable reminder that I slept in a tipi last night. (Although, with its hardwood floors, leather armchairs, and luxuriant Egyptian cotton and hand-made quilts, the transition to camping is hardly challenging, and, if canvas doesn’t appeal, guests can also stay in a sumptuous pioneer cottage.) We meet the famous Mustangs at feeding time when hordes of wild horses bashfully approach our wagon, their velvety noses pushing through the hay bundles. Listening to their satisfied snuffles and admiring their heavily lashed eyes, it’s hard to imagine how these placid beasts can be considered a nuisance. Life under canvas: Guests at Mustang Monument can opt to sleep in a luxury tipi . We take off on regular saddle horses up Spruce Mountain led by Clay Nannini, who is riding a broken-in Mustang. Resident cowboy and rodeo champion, his spirit of adventure makes me feel I’m in dusty pursuit of a steam train hiding a gang of runaway bandits. The 21st century, ultra-luxe reality check arrives when Madeleine meets our gang with a lunch of artisan sandwiches and homemade lemonade, taken under a canopy overlooking the valley. Riding is by no means the only activity. There's rifle shooting, lasso tutorials and archery under the guidance of former US Navy Seal Monty Heath. For the slightly less authentic - but seriously fun - Wild West experience, there are Dune buggies, abseiling and mountain biking. Each day is book-ended by the saloon. Its rustic exposed woods and card tables are lantern-lit for pre-dinner cocktails and exquisitely arranged canapés. No peanut shells or nightly brawls here; just amber evenings filled with roaring chatter and witty anecdotes from the guides Clay and Monty. Madeleine tells us over the crackling fire that the resort is expanding to include nights where guests can sleep under the stars. No walls, no electricity – just wilderness under the inky night sky. Creature comforts: For those who prefer walls to tents, rustic cabins are also available . In bringing freedom to Mustangs in the wide-open spaces of America, Madeleine is bringing freedom to her guests too; as well as a slug of the old American Dream. In this wifi-less zone, even the most driven CEOs – and plenty come here, in their private helicopters, along with a dusting of Hollywood A-listers, though they won’t tell me who – cast off their shackles. Children lose the playstations, iPhones, and TVs and learn about archery, horse-riding and calf-roping, off-road vehicles, abseiling, and target shooting, or even learn to ride for the first time. The derelict gold mines and eerie ghost towns that are littered across the mountain ranges are evidence that the dream didn’t last for everyone; but in this case, a happy ending seems assured. Steppes Travel (0843 7789926, www.steppestravel.com) offer a five night stay at Mustang Monument Wild Horse Eco Resort. Prices from £2,995 per person, based on two people sharing a tipi. Price includes accommodation on a full board basis including return flights, most activities and excursions, and car hire.","Mustang Monument sits in north-east of the rugged state of Nevada .

"It's long been known that 'health and safety' has become a catch-all term used to mask shoddy customer service rather than breaches of the law - and now finally, we have the proof. From daffodils being banned on a village green to a chippie not allowing customers to put salt and vinegar on their meal, here we reveal what is not banned under health and safety - despite what some organisations have claimed. Among the most ridiculous situations to be prohibited under the guise of health and safety were council parks staff ordering the small wooden canes that protect daffodil bulbs to be removed from the flower bed. The Health and Safety Executive's panel attempts to 'bust' myths surrounding what are breaches of health and safety laws. Among the most absurd it considered was a claim daffodils in a village green were a danger to the public . This was because a member of the public complained someone could be hurt should they fall over onto the flowers. The Health and Safety Executive's Myth Busters Challenge Panel refuted it was a health and safety issue, stating in its decision that 'the request from the park's department to remove the canes is completely disproportionate to the minor hazards presented by them'. In another equally absurd scenario, a chippie refused to allow a customer to use his salt and vinegar shakers to apply their preferred amount to their meal, as the chippie couldn't be sure the individual's hands were clean. The panel ruled this problem could be easily solved by providing a separate shakers for customers, or salt and vinegar sachets. And a third case involved the first nightclub in Britain to ban selfie sticks. Although the panel said the ban was entirely reasonable - it was unfortunate the club's management used the smokescreen of health and safety to do so. More than 600 people approached the Health and Safety Executive’s (HSE) Myth Busters Challenge Panel in its first three years after being told ‘health and safety’ stopped them from doing something. Work and Pensions Minister, Lord Freud said: 'People have had enough of bizarre health and safety excuses. 'The HSE’s myth busters panel is quashing these ridiculous excuses and making sure people know it isn’t the law standing in their way. 'For too long businesses have been consumed by red tape and confusion, often feeling they needed to go beyond the requirements of the law, but it’s never been easier to understand the rules and make the right choice, without diluting protection for workers.'","EXCLUSIVE: The top 10 health and safety myths revealed, according to  law .

"Murder suspect Robert Durst grinned and stretched out across the backseat of a police car as he was driven to jail  in handcuffs on Tuesday. Durst, 71, appeared before a judge for a second straight day in his prison-issue, orange jumpsuit to face drug and weapons charges in New Orleans, Louisiana. Authorities found more than a quarter-pound of marijuana and a revolver in millionaire Robert Durst's hotel room when he was arrested over the weekend, a prosecutor said Tuesday. Durst was expected to be held at a Louisiana prison for several more days before being extradited to LA where he has been charged with the first-degree murder of his friend, Susan Berman. Scroll down for videos . All smiles: Robert Durst, who has been charged with first-degree murder in Los Angeles, is transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment in New Orleans on Tuesday . Robert Durst is escorted into Orleans Parish Prison. Durst was rebooked on charges of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance, a small amount of marijuana on Tuesday . And despite the fact the frail 71-year-old is behind bars, his family is so scared of him that they have taken out a restraining order. A New Orleans judge has approved an order of protection, preventing Durst from contacting his brother Douglas, head of $1 billion, family business Durst Corp, and other members of his family. Durst, who is worth an estimated $100 million, has been suspected in the disappearance of his first wife and he won an acquittal on a murder charge in Texas. In a documentary about Durst's troubled life, he mumbled about how he 'killed them all,' providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series. But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote. It was revealed on Tuesday that the final episode of HBO's six-part series, The Jinx, drew more than a million viewers on Sunday evening - more than double the audience from the week before. Analysis linking a letter Durst wrote to his friend Susan Berman a year before her killing with one he said 'only the killer could have written' to point police to her body was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. Durst, 71, was charged Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. He waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him late Monday with being a felon in possession of a gun because he had a revolver when he was arrested there Saturday. Assistant District Mark Burton said they found the pot and gun in his hotel room. Attorney Dick DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest. 'The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact,' he said. 'We want a hearing as quickly as possible so Mr. Durst can go to California and face trial as quickly as possible.' The judge in New Orleans, Magistrate Harry Cantrell, scheduled another hearing for next Monday. Presented with the two letters in the finale of 'The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst' that aired Sunday on HBO, the eccentric heir blinked, burped oddly, pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer. Then he stepped away from the tense interview and went to the bathroom, still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next. Durst was arrested on Saturday afternoon in New Orleans after police in Los Angeles turned up new evidence in a 15-year-old murder . Durst was back in police custody after an HBO show, The Jinx, appeared to show him confessing to three murders in an unguarded moment. The high-profile eccentric is pictured on Tuesday being driven to jail . 'There it is. You're caught!' Durst whispered before the sound of running water is heard. 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' That moment didn't just make for a captivating ending to the documentary on the eccentric life of an heir to a New York real estate fortune, it could also provide additional evidence for prosecutors. Susan Berman was found shot execution-style outside her home in LA in 2000. Her friend, Robert Durst, was charged with her murder on Monday . The official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the bathroom recording was not presented to prosecutors before charges were filed because detectives were still trying to determine if the recording was tampered with in any way. But legal experts said the audio and other parts of the interview could become key evidence. 'Any statement that the defendant makes that they want to use against him, they can use against him,' said Andrea Roth, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Kerry Lawrence, a defense attorney in Westchester County, New York, said Durst's lawyers will have to try to explain away his comments, perhaps dismissing them as a joke. 'Prosecutors would argue it was a candid moment of self-reflection, and I assume will argue that he knew he was still being recorded, and this was either said in jest or he was being facetious or sarcastic or was being provocative,' Lawrence said. 'I don't think it's quite the smoking gun.' Durst — still worth millions despite his estrangement from his family, whose New York real estate empire is worth about $4 billion — has maintained his innocence in three killings in as many states. When Durst approached the filmmakers and agreed to go on camera, against the advice of his lawyers, he had already weathered one murder case, winning an acquittal in a gory Galveston, Texas, dismemberment case by claiming he shot his neighbor in self-defense. He was still suspected in the killing of Berman, whose father was a Las Vegas mobster associated with Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, and the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, who was declared dead long after she vanished in New York in 1982. Robert Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack (pictured left),  has been missing since 1982. Her brother, Jim McCormack, said on Tuesday that following the HBO show he hoped Durst would have an 'epiphany of conscience' and tell them what happened to his sister . Berman, 55, was shot once in the back of the head at her home near Beverly Hills shortly before New York investigators planned to question her about Kathleen Durst's disappearance. The documentary showed filmmaker Andrew Jarecki confronting Durst with a copy of an anonymous letter that alerted Beverly Hills police to look for a 'cadaver' at Berman's address. Durst offered that whoever sent it was 'taking a big risk. You're sending a letter to police that only the killer could have written.' Then, in the final episode, Jarecki revealed another envelope, which Durst acknowledged mailing to Berman, that has similar writing in block letters and also misspelled the address as 'Beverley.' 'I wrote this one but I did not write the cadaver one,' Durst said. But when shown an enlargement of both copies, Durst couldn't distinguish them. Robert A.

Gibbens, far right, leave Orleans Parish Criminal District Court on Monday .","Durst, 71, appeared before a judge for a second straight day in New Orleans after being found with a gun and drugs .

"Robert Durst was found in possession of a latex mask, fake ID and $42,000 divided into small packages when he was arrested for murder at his New Orleans hotel room on Saturday, it has been revealed. The mask would have completely altered the 71-year-old real estate heir's look and a new Texas ID had the name, Everette Ward, according to an arrest warrant seen by TMZ. He also reportedly had wads of $100 bills, totalling $42,000, bundled in small envelopes. He had allegedly been withdrawing $9,000-a-day for more than a month. Scroll down for video . Robert Durst grinned as he was transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on Tuesday. An arrest warrant revealed that a latex mask was found during his arrest on Saturday along with a revolver and $42,000 . TMZ also reported that a UPS tracking number was found in the hotel room because, he told cops, he wanted to ship money. Durst was charged with weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans after a revolver and quarter-pound of marijuana was found at his room in the New Orleans Marriott hotel. Police also found one shell casing and extra ammunition with the gun but it was not known where the weapon was discharged. In a separate search at Durst's home on Tuesday, police found two copies - one paper and one hardback - of 'A Deadly Secret: The Strange Disappearance of Kathie Durst' - about the 71-year-old's wife who vanished in 1982, TMZ reported. Durst was found with a latex mask which was capable of altering his appearance, according to an arrest warrant (stock image) At the weekend, investigators had suggested that Durst may have been attempting to flee to Cuba, where direct, non-stop flights started from New Orleans on Saturday. On Tuesday, Durst was transferred to a prison wing for the mentally ill in New Orleans while he awaits extradition to LA to face the first-degree murder charge. Questions also surfaced over his links to two missing California girls. The troubled real estate heir was moved to the acute mental health facility at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in Louisiana because he is considered a suicide risk, according to the sheriff's office on Wednesday. Durst has been charged with murder over the execution-style shooting of friend, Susan Berman, 15 years ago in LA. He also has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen McCormack, in New York. And now, Eureka Police Department in California has said they want to probe links between Durst and 16-year-old Karen Marie Mitchell, who vanished after leaving her aunt's store in 1997. Durst had reportedly visited the aunt's store dressed in drag. Five months earlier, Kristen Modafferi, 18, also vanished after leaving her job in San Francisco. Durst was in the Bay area at the time, CBS reported. In 2003, Durst was acquitted of murder after he admitted to killing a neighbor in self-defense, dismembering him and throwing the body parts in Galveston Bay, Texas. He admitted that he had shot neighbor, Morris Black, in the defense but that his actions were self-defense. At the time, Durst was living as an odd and mute woman, named Dorothy Ciner. Durst's lawyer does not believe his client suffers from acute mental illness, according to a brief filed by the sheriff's office on Tuesday. A three-judge panel ruled that the sheriff has sole authority to decide where to house inmates needing mental health treatment. Law enforcement officers stand outside the building where Robert Durst is believed to own three condominiums on Tuesday in Houston, Texas. Cops and the FBI searched the millionaire's home and left with two boxes, possibly of evidence . The magistrate agreed Durst should stay in the city jail so he could help his defense team prepare for his weapons case. But the sheriff's office said in its brief that lawyers could have 'virtually unrestricted access' to Durst with 24 hours' notice to the prison. Dick DeGuerin, Durst's lead attorney in New Orleans, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As Durst was placed in psychiatric care on Tuesday, police raided his home in Houston, removing two boxes of possible evidence. Seven officers searched Durst's home for several hours at a 17-story condominium building in an upmarket neighborhood before carrying out two white cardboard document boxes. Around 8.30pm the officers, including one wearing a Los Angeles Police Department badge, carried two  boxes to their six vehicles and left. FBI agents were participating in the operation at the request of the LAPD, a spokeswoman said. The LAPD would not comment until Durst was in the department's custody. Eureka police said on Tuesday they would like to speak to Durst about his possible connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997 . Five months before Miss Mitchell's disappearance, Kristen Modafferi, 18, also vanished after leaving her job in San Francisco . Police searching Robert Durst’s Houston home on Tuesday found three crime-related books, according to a list of items recovered in the execution of a search warrant. Cops founds two copies of A Deadly Secret, a book about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's wife Kathie Durst and one copy of Without A Trace about Durst being acquitted in the 2001 death and dismemberment of his Galveston neighbor, Morris Black. Police also found seven credit cards, seven blank checks and five boxes containing court documents and news articles in his possession. He also had a trash bag filled with court transcripts. Cops found two copies of A Deadly Secret when they searched Durst's Houston home . Dick DeGuerin, Durst's longtime Houston defense attorney, said he was baffled by what investigators could be looking for in the condo building. 'I don't know what they're looking for. I don't know what they could be looking for 15 years after Susan Berman was killed 1,500 miles away... I think it's a publicity stunt. 'I'm not surprised by it, but I would really be surprised if they found anything of any evidentiary value,' he said. 'They can search now till kingdom come. They're not going to find anything because there isn't anything.' Durst's arrest in New Orleans came the day before the finale of HBO series, The Jinx, about his links to the three killings. On the final episode, Durst made an apparent confession, saying in an unguarded moment: 'I killed them all, of course.' Eureka Police Department in California has said they want to speak to those investigating Durst in LA and New Orleans about a missing teenage girl from the late 90s, NBC News reported on Tuesday. Karen Mitchell, 16, vanished in  Eureka, California, on November 25, 1997. Author, Matt Birkbeck, who has written repeatedly about Durst, claimed to CBS that Durst had been seen with the teen at a homeless shelter where she volunteered. Eureka Police Department Chief Andy Mills said on Tuesday that he believed foul play was involved in the girl's disappearance and that he wanted to know more about the time when Durst was in California. Five months earlier on June 23, North Carolina college student Kristen Modafferi vanished on a trip to San Francisco . However he cautioned against any conclusions being drawn too quickly. Durst was being held in Louisiana on drug and weapons charges after being found with a quarter-pound of marijuana and a revolver during his arrest on Saturday. It's not clear how soon he will be returned to California. The real estate mogul was charged on Monday in LA with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Susan Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. Durst was rebooked on charges of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance, a small amount of marijuana on Tuesday . In the six-part documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, the 71-year-old mumbled about how he 'killed them all,' providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series. But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote. Analysis linked a letter Durst wrote to Berman a year before her killing with one that pointed police to her body, and that was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation. Bob Martin, who has lived with his wife, Carol, in the Houston condo building for 18 months, said he would occasionally say hello to Durst and discuss the real estate market with him. He described Durst as no quirkier than anyone else in the building. He added that Durst would occasionally attend the building's homeowners' association meetings and that the building staff reported Durst was courteous to them, as well. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him with being a felon in possession of a gun and with having marijuana. Assistant District Mark Burton said investigators found more than a quarter-pound of pot and a revolver in his hotel room. Attorney Dick DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest. 'The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact,' he said.

From the living room sofa that has been inherited, to the kitchen tops that were once used in a science lab, the wardrobe now used as kitchen storage and the fireplace that once caused her to burst into tears, Miss Allsopp's home is full of quirky collects. Scroll down for video . Kirstie Allsopp, pictured above in her Notting Hill home, is a household name for her thrifty interior ideas . And it should come as no surprise, as the face of shows such as Kirstie's Homemade Home and Location, Location, Location, the property expert knows a thing or two about transforming a living space. She and her partner Ben Andersen bought their London house, a 1950s property, in September 2006, a few months after her first son Bay, now nine, was born and set about turning it into a home. Talking about her house, which was once two flats which have been knocked together to create an open and airy family home, Miss Allsopp, 43, who also has a son Oscar, seven, and is step-mother to Ben's two sons, said: 'I can't think of anything that hasn't got some sort of story behind it. 'Someone asked me if I designed all this, but it's not like that. It comes together over time. You get things all the time and you are adding and taking things away.' Here Miss Allsopp who will be hosting The Handmade Fair, sponsored by Hobbycraft, later this year in September, shows how she has brought them all together to create a unique living space for her family. Kirstie's husband Ben bought the kitchen worktops from a school science lab, above . Kirstie's sofa, above, is on its way out as according to the TV star it 'has got a huge tear in it' Living room sofa . 'That sofa has now got a huge tear in it. They are so old these sofas. Ben got them years ago, before he met me even. They weren't always here. He doesn't like buying new sofas so we just sort of move things around. But I am actually going to have to basically get either a new sofa or swap this for another type of sofa soon.' 'Once you know you're not going to just buy something new, once you've made that decision – and I hate calling it an ethical decision because that makes it sound like you are really up your own bottom, but we have made an active decision not to go out and buy new things. That decision has been made.' The 'Blue Peter' fire place . 'I was pregnant with my first child and Ben took me to the Goldborne Road and there was this fireplace that he loved. I burst into tears because I just didn't know what else to do. It was a disgraceful performance on my behalf. 'I wept ""please no, let's not buy that fireplace""'. I was so ashamed at my lack of backbone. ""I really don't think we should buy this fireplace"", I kept saying. I was so ashamed of myself. 'I bought the fireplace for a lot of money. I said to Ben ""I've bought the fireplace, when you have a building which needs a new fireplace and everything else, you can put it in and you are bound to need it at some point. I'm sorry I cried, it's a beautiful fireplace. I just don't want it in my home.""' Kirstie admits she 'wept' when she first bought the fireplace above, as she 'didn't want it in her home' 'Then we were moving in here but it wasn't ready by the time Bay was born so I went down and stayed in Devon for a bit and Ben came up during the week to supervise the works. When I came back from Devon, there was the fireplace…' 'My mum used to call it the Blue Peter fireplace. The one thing I dread is that he finds whatever is missing from the middle bit. It's some God-awful piece of brass and I hope he doesn't ever stumble across it. 'No, but I'm very fond of it now. It's very baronial, I think that's the word. For a while there was a glass sword hung up there on a nail. I've taken it down now. And look, there's an invitation to an event in 2014 up here. That's how often I sort it out.' Kitchen . When they bought the flat downstairs, they had a reshuffle of rooms and turned a bedroom into the kitchen and made it open plan with what is now the dining room. They kept most of the kitchen furniture such as the worktops and the aga. 'These worktops are from a school science lab. Ben got hold of them. Look, if you look closely you can still see the marks where the old Bunsen burners would have been attached,' sats Kirstie. The larder and things inside . There are all sorts of useful bits and bobs in the larder. Kirstie says: 'It's not looking so tidy at the moment because we've just shoved things in here. My sister always says she wants to be here in a nuclear winter. You could live off this for a long time.' Inside, there is a wicker basket with separate compartments for bottles which she bought recently in Holmfirth. Kirstie explains: 'This is apple juice from Devon, from home. We've got an orchard. There's a place just up the hill that has a big apple press. You pick the apples, take them up there, they press it and sent it back to you and you keep the bottles for the next time. 'I'm a big picnic person. I bought these (huge silver flasks from stews etc) back from Kenya. There, 46 per cent of people don't have running water. So the supermarkets have loads of picnic stuff. 'They have loads of family gatherings with lots of picnic stuff. You can put a stew in there. I like winter picnics. Some people on twitter said 'nobody has winter picnics…but they are absolutely brilliant. Kirstie's larder is so full, above, that her sister jokes she wants to be there in a nuclear winter . Kirstie, who is dyslexic, points out a sign she wrote with a spelling error: 'Please keep the larder this way, Thak You' '[In here is] Ben's deep fat fryer. He's not allowed to switch it on in the house. He has to go and plug it in outside by the BBQ. It stinks - the smell of deep fat frying - you can never get it out. 'Actually, it needs a bit of a tidy up in here. It's not as tidy as it usually is.' She points to a small picnic basket with jubilee design: 'This is my pride and joy. Do you remember the royal concert for the jubilee? Well we had a couple of tickets and everyone there got their own picnic basket. They are so good.' 'The brilliant thing about this room is that is keeps everything in it. 'There's hot chocolate from Switzerland. When we go we always drive and we pick it up from the co-op there. 'I made this sign when the larder was nice and tidy and then I managed to write 'thak you' on the sign. Look at that, 'thak you' [Kirstie has dyslexia]. The wardrobe in the kitchen . 'We bought that together actually and it works incredibly well. Again, I think kitchen storage is incredibly important. We had to take careful measurements to make sure it would fit under that beam,' says Kirstie. Wooden thing on top of the fridge next to wardrobe . Kirstie says: 'I bought that in Bath when I was on my own. If I buy things on my own, it always gets shifted all over the house and Ben never accepts that he likes it.' Kirstie loves her kitchen wardrobe, above, and says that she thinks kitchen storage is very important . The new fridge . 'This is my new fridge. I've had three second hand fridges. If someone buys one of Ben's buildings we just have them from there so we never throw them out. The light in the fridge kept tripping the other day and our housekeeper said ""Oh, be careful, the fridge was giving everybody electric shocks,"" 'So I said: ""No, that's enough! I want a new fridge!"" This is new, new, new, sparkly new. It's Fisher and Paykel. Look at the layout. I love it. Look at the ice tray, everything is there. Ohh, there's lamb in the freezer there from Devon. We have our own sheep down there. It's a great layout, I'd recommend it to anyone. 'We are really lucky. I earn a fortune, Ben earns a fortune. We are not buying things second hand because we can't afford to. And we are not pretending to. We couldn't have second hand fridges because we couldn't afford them, it's just that Ben didn't want to waste a perfectly good one just because you didn't pick it. In a way, because you take time to make decision over things, it takes time to sort things out.'","Host of 'Kirstie's Fill Your House For Free' lives in 1950s West London pad .

"Britain's beer is getting weaker, with popular lagers such as Stella Artois and Budweiser reducing alcohol content . Britain's beer is getting weaker thanks to the rise in popularity of low-strength tipples and more health-conscious drinkers. Despite the UK's reputation as a country which enjoys a pint, two billion fewer units of alcohol were consumed over the last two years, according to official figures. The decline is largely because the strength of alcoholic drinks has fallen from an average of 4.42 per cent to 4.14 per cent over the two years, a report by the Department of Health says. Increasingly health-conscious drinkers are also playing a part, the Sunday Telegraph reported, with a sharp rise in choice of lower-strength booze. Brewers are also responding to lower tax rates imposed on beers with 2.8 per cent or less alcohol. The change in levy was followed by a number of brewers weakening their products, including Carlsberg's Skol lager dropping from three per cent to 2.8 per cent. Stronger lagers, such as Becks, Stella Artois and Budweiser, also reduced their alcohol levels from 5 per cent to 4.8 per cent, while John Smith's Extra Smooth bitter falling from 3.8 to 3.6 per cent. Low-strength lagers introduced in recent years include beer-citrus fusions such as Carling Zest (2.8 per cent), Carlsberg Citrus (2.8 per cent) and Foster's Radler (two per cent). Brigid Simmons, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association said: 'British brewers have responded to consumer demand for a greater range and choice of lower-strength beers, many with new flavours and ingredients. 'We’ve seen the Government’s decision to give 50 per cent tax relief to lower-strength beers combining with a growth in interest among consumers for lower-strength drinks like beer, that are also lower in calories.' While the number of units of alcohol consumed has decreased over the last years, Britain still gets through more alcohol per head than most other nations . The news comes a month after official figures showed the number of under-25s who do not drink at all has increased by 40 per cent in eight years. A quarter of young people do not drink at all and binge drinking  is falling, but Britain still drinks more alcohol per head than most other countries. Tom Smith, from Alcohol Concern, said: 'While we welcome the decrease in the number of alcohol units in the market, we can’t ignore the fact our NHS and communities continue to strain under the burden of alcohol harms.'","Britain consumed two billion fewer units of alcohol over the last two years .

"Do you love rice but are worried about your weight? The good news is scientists have now discovered a way to reduce the calorie content by 60 per cent - simply by the way it is cooked. Cooking the rice with coconut oil, and then cooling it for 12 hours in the fridge, more than halved the number of calories in the rice when it was eaten. However, doctors have previously warned that eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning, and so advise making sure the rice is steaming hot all the way through before eating it. They also advise leaving the rice in the fridge no more than a day before reheating. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered that adding coconut oil to rice and cooling it in the fridge for 12 hours cuts the calorie content in half . The Sri Lankan researchers experimented with 38 kinds of rice from the country. Their recommended method of preparing the rice increases the amount of resistant starch inside it, which is indigestible to the human body. Therefore this resistant starch is not absorbed and turned into energy or fat, and has no calories. The scientists found a two-step process that was able to increase the amount of resistant starch in rice by 10 times. First, they added a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water, adding half a cup (105g) of rice, and then either simmering it for 40 minutes, or boiling it for 20 to 25 minutes. Then, they put the rice in the fridge for 12 hours to cool. Lead researcher Sudhair  James, of The College of Chemical Sciences, Sri Lanka, said if the best variety of rice is prepared using this method, 'it might reduce the calories by about 50-60 per cent.' He said the team wanted to find food-based solutions to the problem of obesity in developing countries, where rice is often a staple food. 'We discovered that increasing rice resistant starch (RS) concentrations was a novel way to approach the problem,' he said. The coconut oil enters the starch granules in the rice during its cooking, changing its architecture so it can no longer be digested, experts explained . A cup, or 210g of rice, contains around 240 calories. Mr James explained that starch can be digestible or indigestible. Rice is made of both of these types of starch. Unlike digestible types of starch, RS is not broken down in the small intestine, where carbohydrates are normally metabolized into glucose and other simple sugars and absorbed into the bloodstream. So, the researchers reasoned that if they could transform digestible starch into RS, then that could lower the number of calories of the rice. This is because the coconut oil enters the starch granules during cooking, changing its architecture so that it becomes resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, Mr James explained. This means that fewer calories ultimately get absorbed into the body. The cooling for 12 hours is essential, but reheating the rice for consumption does not affect the RS levels, he said. He added that the next step will be to complete studies with humans to learn which varieties of rice might be best suited to the calorie-reduction process. The team also will also experiment to see if other oils besides coconut have this effect. The research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world's largest scientific society. Doctors warn reheated rice can cause food poisoning . Doctors warn that reheated rice can cause food poisoning. However, it's not the reheating that causes the problem but the way the rice has been stored before it was reheated. Uncooked rice can contain spores of Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. When the rice is cooked, the spores can survive. If the rice is left standing at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria. These bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins that cause vomiting or diarrhoea. The longer cooked rice is left at room temperature, the more likely it is that the bacteria or toxins could make the rice unsafe to eat. How to serve rice safely: . · ideally, serve rice as soon as it has been cooked . · if that isn't possible, cool the rice as quickly as possible (ideally within one hour) · keep rice in the fridge for no more than one day until reheating . · when you reheat any rice, always check that the dish is steaming hot all the way through . · do not reheat rice more than once .

"It has a starring role in the classic movie The Italian Job – in one of the most memorable opening sequences in cinema history. A stunning orange supercar races through the Alps, before disappearing into a tunnel. Then, in a heartbreaking moment for car fans, the Lamborghini Miura crashes in a ball of flames. The smashed up wreckage is dragged out of the tunnel by the mafia and pushed into a ravine by a bulldozer – followed by a wreath for the driver. The millions who have seen the iconic film since it was made in 1969 must have assumed the car was an irrecoverable write-off, never to be driven again. Scroll down for video . The holy grail of supercars: Fans had assumed the iconic Lamborghini Miura was a complete write-off . The car, now worth more than £1 million,  was found in pristine condition and bought by two British buisnessmen. Pictured: Joint owner Iain Tyrrell . But now The Mail on Sunday can reveal the car seen powering through the Alps has been found in pristine condition – and is worth more than £1 million. Described as ‘the holy grail of supercars’, it has been tracked down by two British businessman. The car’s new co-owner, Iain Tyrrell, received a tip-off at Christmas that the Miura had resurfaced. He said: ‘I was initially sceptical because no one had seen it for 46 years. But my source was a credible one so I started to pursue it.’ He was invited to see it – but given just three hours to verify the vehicle as the genuine article. ‘It was all very James Bond-ish – I had to go to Paris to inspect the car in a secret underground car park,’ he said. Mr Tyrrell learned that the thrilling sequence that opens The Italian Job was shot using two cars – both supplied by Lamborghini, but one of them was already smashed up. It is the first, intact, car that has now been found. Mr Tyrrell said: ‘The Italian Job Lamborghini is the holy grail of supercars precisely because no one knew what happened to it after the film. I have a life-long passion for these cars but I just assumed this particular vehicle was out of reach.’ As the Miura is still in near-mint condition, Mr Tyrrell – who owns Cheshire Classic Cars – was able to cross-reference its original features with stills from the film. He has also checked the car’s history at the Lamborghini archive. He said: ‘After inspecting the car, there is no doubt in my mind that it is the Miura from The Italian Job. Top Gear magazine named the Lamborghini, featured in the opening sequence of The Italian Job, the coolest car in the world . In the 1969 iconic film the stunning orange supercar races through the Alps, before disappearing into a tunnel . The Lamborghini crashes in a ball of flames and is then dragged out of the tunnel by the mafia before being pushed into a ravine by a bulldozer . The opening sequence of the film was shot using two cars, but one was already smashed up . ‘There are certain quirks within the interior of the car, such as the trim and the stitching. They are like a fingerprint or a birth mark. They can’t be replaced.’ Research has uncovered that the filmmakers, Paramount, hired the car from Lamborghini and after filming it was sold to a dealer. Michael Caine and Maggie Blye in the movie . The dealer then sold the Miura to an unidentified buyer. In 2005, after it had changed hands a few times, Norbetto Ferretti, a luxury yacht manufacturer, bought it. This transaction brought a remarkable coincidence to the saga – as Mr Ferretti was the son of the dealer who originally bought it from Lamborghini after The Italian Job. Incredibly, it seems that both he and its previous owners had been completely unaware of its role in the movie. Mr Tyrrell and his friend and co-owner, Keith Ashworth, now plan to display the Lamborghini around the world, although they have not ruled out selling it on. The car’s value is likely to increase substantially in the light of its history. But the Miura mystery has not been entirely solved. The smashed -up Lamborghini, vanished without trace after it disappeared down the mountainside. Mr Tyrrell said: ‘When the production team went back to salvage the remains of the crashed car the next day it had gone. The whole car had disappeared and had obviously been stolen.’ Built between 1966 and 1973, the 170mph Lamborghini Miura is widely credited with kick-starting the trend for high performance two-seater sports cars. In 2004, Top Gear magazine voted it the coolest car in the world.","Lamborghini Miura crashes in ball of flames at start of The Italian job .

"Aircraft in the future could feature three decks, generate their own power and be 75 per cent quieter than current aircraft, according to designs for new concept plane. The Progress Eagle would have capacity for around 800 passengers and would run on hydrogen fuel rather than the high-grade aircraft fossil fuels used today. The Airbus A380, currently the world's largest passenger airliner, carries around 525 people. Scroll down for video . The Progress Eagle has three decks to provide capacity for more than 800 passengers along with beds and office space for crew members . The AWWA-QG Progress Eagle was dreamed up by Barcelona-based designer Oscar Viñals as part of his vision for how travelling by air could be in 2030. His design uses six hydrogen fuel engines - one to drive a central screw-type engine at the rear to achieve the thrust needed to take off along with five superconductive engines. Capacity: 800 passengers . Wingspan: 96m . Length: 80m . Decks: 3 . Engines: Five superconductive engines . Other features: Solar panels on wings and rear engine that doubles as wind turbine . Once it reaches the right altitude, however, the central engine turns off and starts to generate electricity from the airflowing through it. Solar panels would also help to generate electrical power that the aircraft uses while it is in flight. Mr Viñals said that the aircraft would produce zero carbon emissions and would also be far quieter than current airliners. Excess energy stored in the aircraft's batteries could be recovered by special electrical storage trucks on the ground when it lands. The cockpit itself is located on the second deck and includes beds an office and a workroom. According to Mr Viñals the aircraft would be made from lightweight materials like carbon fibre, aluminum, titanium and ceramics. He said the wingspan would be 96 metres (314 feet) with the option of folding a section of the wings to make the aircraft easier to manoeuvre in airports. An Airbus A380 has a wingspan of 80 metres (262 feet) and a Boeing 747 is 64 metres (209 feet) across. The AWWA-QG Progress Eagle has solar panels on its wings and carries air turbines to allow it to generate its own energy while in flight . The huge 96 metre wide wingspan may cause problems when maneuvering on the ground in airports but Mr Viñals says the wings may fold . Mr Viñals said: 'The Progress Eagle is based in the technology beyond 2030 with ideas from quantum mechanics, if we consider the evolution of current technology and future progress in uses of theoretical physics solutions. 'Today we can find these technologies in the most advanced laboratories around the world (universities, private companies, government installations) and in the theories of the best scientifics. For these reasons, the innovations that the Progress Eagle presents could be available in fifteen years' time. The image above shows how, if it was to be built, the new Progress Eagle, would dwarf even the largest airliners used to carry passengers today . 'The most relevant aspects about this ""Super Jet"" would have a closer relation with quantum mechanics, we can simplify the airplane concept like a ""Mega"" energy's particle with special specifications more orthodox than we can found in today's physics.' This is the second concept aircraft designed by Mr Viñals - last year he released designs for the AWWA Sky Whale, with a wingspan of 88m. He said the Progress Eagle is more of a big brother to the Sky Whale. The design features a single rotating engine at the back of the aircraft which would combine with other engines under the wings to provide thrust . Once air bourne the rear engine can be converted into a turbine that produce electricity from the air flowing through it to help power the aircraft .","Futuristic AWWA-QG Progress Eagle concept aircraft was dreamed up by Barcelona-based designer Oscar Viñals .

"Next year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro could be a stinker...because of severe pollution in the city's filthy waterways. Athletes have complained of the stench while practising at the sailing venue in the city, with sailors saying they have had to dodge everything from dead animals and discarded sofas to plastic bags. It is estimated that around 60% of the city's sewage is untreated and dumped into the city's waterways which will flow into venues for sailing, rowing and distance swimming at the Olympics. Polluted: Young boys play in the water of Guanabara Bay, where sailing will take place at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games . Trash: Discarded rubbish litters the banks of Rio de Janeiro's Guanabara Bay. Officials face a race against time to now have it cleaned up for the Olympic Games next year . Rubbish: Tyres, office seats and televisions are amongst just some of the junk that is washed up in the bay . Garbage: Between approximately 80 and 100 tonnes of garbage are washed into the bay every day, including household waste and raw sewage . Guanabara Bay, one of the iconic locations of Rio, is still blighted by sewage, industrial pollution and illegal dumping. Several Olympic sailors have complained it is the dirtiest place they have ever trained or competed in. Nick Thompson, one of Britain's top sailors, said recently: 'Water quality is my biggest personal concern. If you are sick during the Games, it's game over.' Ahead of next year's Games, he plans to take 'probiotic supplements and fish oil to strengthen the gut' as he bids to avoid illness. And Stephen Park, British Sailing Team's manager, said recently: 'The sailors are on various supplements to mitigate against it, but we can't do anything about the water quality'. It has been estimated that between approximately 80 and 100 tonnes of garbage are washed into the bay every day - but the government only manage to remove around 400 tonnes per month. In February, thousands of dead fish were found floating in the waters of the bay. And in December, a drug-resistant 'super bacteria' normally found in hospitals was also discovered in the water around the bay. In total, 15 cities share the bay's shoreline and it is estimated that the waste of eight million people is still being untreated as it flows into the water, producing over 18,000 litres of sewage per second. Iconic: Guanabara Bay is one of the most iconic sights of Rio de Janeiro, seen here with Sugarloaf Mountaton in the background . Junk: Dead fish and discarded plastic cups lie next to a burst football on the sands of Guanabara Bay . Waste: Everyday household waste litters the shores of Guanabara Bay in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro . Clean up: Thousands of dead fish had to be removed from the bay by the city's council workers last month . Removed: Guanabara Bay is blighted by sewage, industrial pollution and illegal dumping . It has been estimated that fecal matter in the city's water system can reach more than 200 times that of the limit declared legal in the United States. Olympics organisers have admitted that the quality of water is an ongoing concern, but have insisted it will be safe for the Games. Mario Andrada, Rio 2016 director of communications, said recently: 'There is a huge problem with garbage.' He said the state of the sailing venue remains a priority 'because the water is not fully clean, but it will be safe for the Olympics'. Rotting: Rio 2016 organisers have admitted the quality of the water is of ongoing concern and said: 'There is a huge problem with garbage' Rancid: Dead fish and garbage are seen in the waters of Guanabara Bay . Risk: Sailors will have to navigate the polluted waters, which are littered with garbage and dead animals . Slick: Pollution is a major concern, but officials at the International Olympic Committee are confident the water will be suitable for the Olympic Games . Last week, Nawal El Moutawakel, head of the International Olympic Committee inspection team, said she was confident that that the problem would be resolved ahead of the Opening Ceremony. She said: 'We want every single venue to be ready for the athletes to compete in a secure and safe manner. 'We have been given reassurances that all the venues will meet the level...so athletes can compete.' The Olympic Games will begin on August 5 next year, with the Paralympic Games starting on September 7.","Athletes complain of condition of venues set to host sailing and swimming .

"A teenager was killed by stepping in front of a train just minutes after being told his grades weren't good enough to stay at sixth form college, an inquest has heard. Michael Platt, 18, had been studying in the first year of sixth form at Ifield Community College in Ifield, West Sussex, and had left the school just ten minutes before he was struck by a train and killed. An inquest at Horsham Coroners' Court heard he had been told he had not achieved the grades to enable him to return for a second year, and was advised to go to Central Sussex College's Crawley campus to see if he could join a course there. Student Michael Platt, 18, walked in front of a train at Horsham station, West Sussex, after finding out he did not have the grades to progress into the second year of college, an inquest has heard . Instead, in a state of 'turmoil', he jumped over the level crossing where he was struck by a train and killed. Michael from Gossops Green, East Sussex, was a member of the college choir and had planned to go to university to study child psychology. Mother Jane spoke at the inquest, and told the coroner her son 'was the life and soul of the party', Crawley News reports. She said her son was her best friend, and added: 'The only time he told me anything, looking back, in hindsight, was he thought the world wasn't a nice place and he had an issue with the way society is. 'All he said was ""what is the point? We struggle; we work hard for nothing at the end of it"". 'I said ""you leave a legacy"". But to him the world was an ugly place.' The 18-year-old had been studying in the first year of sixth form at Ifield Community College in Ifield, West Sussex, and had left the school just ten minutes before he was struck by a train and killed . Inspector Gary Ancell said. 'As the train driver approached the level crossing he said he saw people on either side of the closed gates. 'As he got nearer he saw a young male jump over the barrier and stand in the middle of the railway track, immediately in front of his train. 'There was nothing the train driver could do and he could not stop in time.' Coroner Dr David Skipp said as there was no note left behind, or a phone call from Mr Platt to loved ones, he did not believe the teenager had meant to take his own life. He recorded an open verdict, and added: 'I expect he was in turmoil when he left the school. 'Whatever was going through his mind, he took absolutely drastic measures, measures which I think he hadn't considered the effects of, and who would be hurt by what he did.'

"A Qatar Airways employee has been shamed by airline boss Rossen Dimitrov after he emailed a photo of her slumped on the floor, apparently drunk, to the entire workforce. The photo shows a woman laid on the floor outside her staff accommodation, allegedly sleeping off a drinking session. The Qatar Airways vice president used the opportunity to tell staff how 'disappointed' he was in the cabin crew member's behaviour in a mass email sent to staff. The Qatar Airways staff member was pictured slumped in a doorway after allegedly returning back drunk . The email sent out by Qatar Airways boss Rossen Dimitrov after he came across a photo of a drunk member of staff . In the email, revealed to the Daily Star, Mr Dimitrov wrote: 'I am so ashamed and disturbed by this behaviour displayed by a tenured member of our team, an adult who has been with the company for over 9 years. 'How can we change rules when we do not behave as mature individuals. I am very disappointed.' Qatar Airways - which employs over 31,000 people, is the world's tenth largest airline with a modern fleet of over 100 aircraft. It is also one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world, investing in both the double-decker Airbus A380 planes as well as the ultra-modern A350 XWB, which was unveiled in December last year. The airline has high expectation of staff, particularly as it operates out of the Muslim country, which does not allow the consumption of alcohol among Qatari citizens. Library photo shows a Qatar air stewardess working on board an aircraft. She is not the same stewardess pictured in the photograph above . Qatar Airways told MailOnline Travel the email was sent to remind staff how they need to respect Qatari customs. A spokesperson said: 'The email was sent to impress on our cabin crew that, to make their working environment as good as it can be, while still respecting the norms and values of the Qatari society in which we work, everyone has a part to play. 'In Doha, the consumption of alcohol is not permitted for nationals and, although drinking is permitted for foreigners, being seen to be drunk would be considered highly disrespectful – it would have negative implications for both the individual and those associated with them.' Qatar Airways employs over 31,000 people, and has high standards of its workforce . The spokesperson added: 'In this particular case, the individual concerned was found in a state of incapacity by the entrance of a Qatar Airways staff building. 'The vast majority of our cabin crew would themselves be disappointed at the idea that one of their colleagues should get into this situation, since they share our pride in the reputation of our team, and they would also, as we are, be very concerned about the safety implications for someone in this position.' Referring to Mr Dimitrov's comment in the email about 'changing the rules', the airline commented: 'For over a year we have been working on a review and revision of the employment conditions for our cabin crew members, leading to reforms in our practices that have been universally welcomed by our staff as we have rolled them out since December 2014. 'This is something of which we are proud, but obviously we are making these changes in a culture which remains largely conservative. We think that the cabin crew community has an important part to play in showing that we have done the right thing in making these reforms, which is why we wanted to move quickly to highlight the kind of problems that could be caused by behaviour which offends local culture. The spokesperson continued: 'The matter is now under investigation, and we shall not be commenting further.'","Vice president Rossen Dimitrov sends out mass email regarding incident .

"The 16-year-old girl who survived a deadly axe-attack that claimed the lives of three family members has been released from hospital after suffering severe brain damage and a severed jugular. Marli van Breda has been transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after leaving Vergelegen Medi-Clinic in Somerset West, just outside of Cape Town, on Tuesday, News24 reports. The former Perth schoolgirl has been in hospital since she was struck several times on the head and had her throat slashed in her family's South African home on January 27. Scroll down for video . Marli van Breda, 16, suffered severe brain damage when she was struck several times on the head in her family's South African home in January . Henri van Breda (back left) escaped the attack while his father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed. Marli, 16 (front left), suffered severe head and throat injuries . The attack claimed the lives of her mother Teresa, 54, father Martin, 55, and older brother Rudi, 22. Marli's other brother Henri, 20, escaped with light injuries and rang police to report the deaths at the Stellenbosch home, east of Cape Town. Family spokesman Martin Coetzee said Marli will undergo occupational and physical therapy at the rehabilitation clinic after six weeks in hospital. While her health has improved, Marli has not yet been able to make a complete police statement regarding the attack. She has been able to talk despite her injuries, but not for long periods. The family have not revealed the rehabilitation centre where Marli will be treated so her recovery can go ahead without disruptions. Chilling: An audio recording between Henri (right, pictured with brother Rudi) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe, revealed the 20-year-old appeared to giggle during the call . Marli was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic on Tuesday after spending six weeks at Vergelegen Medi-Clinic in Somerset West, just outside of Cape Town . It comes after reports last month that visitors had been banned from visiting the teenager's hospital room in a bid to keep her surviving brother away. 'They fear she might go into shock, or will be traumatised further if she sees him,' a source told  The Sunday Times newspaper. Marli has reportedly been crying when she sees photos of her parents and brother. 'It is heartbreaking to see tears rolling down her cheeks,' a person close to the family said. It emerged last month that an audio recording of the emergency phone call made by Henri, obtained by eNews Channel Africa, seems to reveal him 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody massacre. 'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.' When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard. A cleaner who worked for one of the van Breda's neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack. Deceased: Martin (left) and wife Theresa (right) both died at their home in Stellenbosch -  east of Cape Town . Rudi (pictured left and right) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman. His younger brother Henri is currently living with his uncle Her after suffering light injuries . The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia . The young man's mental health has been under scrutiny since News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were negative and no further testing occurred. A doctor who examined the young man following the attack revealed his injuries were self-inflicted. He was also reportedly addicted to tik and his allowance was cut off before his family were attacked. Henri has been living with his uncle, Her Breda, since the attack and has been receiving counselling. His uncle denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply being hidden from the media's gaze. Popular: Rudi Van Breda was popular with his friends at Trinity College and the University of Melbourne . Separated siblings: Rudi (left) was killed during the attack, while Marli (right) remains in a critical but stable condition in a South African hospital . A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family' 'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family,' he was quoted in The Times. 'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promise Henri I won't drop him.' No one has been charged over the attack on the family and Marli has a round-the-clock police guard. The family were based in Perth and the Sunshine Coast in Australia, before returning to South Africa in mid-2014.

"Two football fans claim to have sneaked into a Premier League game by pretending one of them was confined to a wheelchair and sitting in the disabled section of the ground. The Everton supporters boasted about their exploits on Facebook - but admitted that some people would see them as 'scum' for the stunt. The pair, who have not been identified, posted a photograph of one of them sitting in a wheelchair while watching the club's away game against Stoke City last Wednesday night. Cheat: Two football fans claim they sneaked into the Britannia Stadium by pretending to be disabled . Boast: The supporters posted this message on a Facebook football fans' page admitted they were 'scum' Writing on a Facebook page called The Football Bible, one of the fans said: 'Me and my mate decided to go to Stoke away last minute on Wednesday. 'The only spare ticket we could get was in the disabled section though. So he borrowed a wheelchair from work and I went as his carer. 'We're scum aren't we? We're going to hell for what we did in Stoke.' The Everton Disabled Supporters Association vowed to investigate the fans' claims - but insisted that they could not have obtained their tickets through the club. Chairman Steve Heneghan said: 'There's no way they could get it from us. If something did happen, we would throw them out of our membership, and the club would do the same.' Game: The supporters managed to watch the match between Everton and Stoke City last Wednesday . He told MailOnline that disabled tickets to away games were generally reserved for fans who regularly attend matches, making it difficult to manipulate the system. Mr Heneghan added: 'You have to keep an eye out for fraudsters. In the past, some fans have just turned up in a wheelchair and been let into the ground - there's no way to guard against that. 'There are people in this world who'll do anything to cheat disabled people. If you're desperate enough, evil enough, devious enough to get into a game, then anyone can do it.' Other disabled fans blasted the stunt at Stoke's Britannia Stadium - Ollie Baskaran wrote on Facebook: 'I'm a wheelchair user and every time I have to book disabled tickets for anywhere, I have to send paperwork etc. just to prove I'm disabled.' However, some web users praised the fans, comparing them jokingly to the fake wheelchair user on TV's Little Britain. Stadium: Stoke City said it was Everton's responsibility to investigate the incident . Jack Bannister wrote: 'All hail the Andy and Lou of the Britannia Stadium! Class act. Lucky Everton didn't score otherwise the game would be up when they got on their feet cheering!' Stoke City said the club was aware of the two fans' online boasts, but said it was up to Everton to take action against the men. A spokesman said: 'We have been made aware of the claims of two Everton fans that they gained access to last week's game at the Britannia Stadium masquerading as a disabled supporter in a wheelchair and carer. 'If their claims prove correct and the people concerned can be identified, it will be for Everton to take action against them as appropriate.' Everton refused to comment on the men's claims, and would not confirm whether or not the club would launch an investigation.","The two fans claimed they borrowed a wheelchair to get into disabled section at Stoke City's Britannia Stadium last week .

"Murdered: Valerie Graves, 55, was killed while house-sitting in West Sussex in December 2013 . More than 2,000 men have come forward to give their DNA to eliminate themselves from the hunt for the murderer of a grandmother. Valerie Graves, 55, was killed while house-sitting over the Christmas period in 2013 and forensic experts were only able to form a limited DNA profile of the murderer from the evidence they gathered - establishing it was a man. The mass DNA screening in January and February asked all men aged over 17 who live, work or visit Bosham in West Sussex, to provide a sample and a thumbprint as part of the  investigation . Artist Ms Graves was found dead in a bedroom in Smugglers Lane, Bosham, on December 30 2013. So far 1,432 men have been eliminated from the enquiry and will receive emails or letters thanking them for providing their DNA. The village Ms Graves was murdered in - Bosham - is a favourite with ITV drama Midsomer Murders. In total, 2,042 men came forward to give samples of their DNA. Due to the volume of samples, eliminating those who have come forward can take up to two months. Detective Superintendent Nick May, of Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'We want to thank all those men who attended the voluntary sessions in Bosham, Fishbourne and Chichester over the three-weeks to give their DNA. 'The response has been positive. 'The process of elimination due to the volume of samples, can take up to two months, although this can sometimes be quicker and we have already given results to more than 1,200 men. 'We expect to give more results over the coming weeks. Hunt for killer: More than 2,000 men have come forward to give their DNA to eliminate themselves from the hunt for the murderer . 'We still need those men who have not come forward to do so. 'We will be doing house-to-house enquiries and knocking on doors during a week of action from 6 to 12 April asking those who have not given their DNA to consider doing so. 'If we don't get a reply we will also be sending out further letters asking them to attend Chichester police station to give their DNA. 'We have to be tenacious in our efforts to catch the killer. 'But we do understand that this is an entirely voluntary process and there is no compulsion for anyone to co-operate with us. 'We simply want to do the best we can for Valerie's family and for the community in bringing the killer to justice.' Ms Graves, 55, was staying at the property with her sister Janet, 60, Janet's boyfriend Nigel Acres, 59, and her mother, Eileen, 87, when she was killed with a claw hammer. Cleared: So far 1,432 men have been eliminated from the enquiry after giving DNA samples . The artist - who had just moved to West Sussex from Scotland - had gone to bed at 10pm on December 29, 2013. Twelve hours later, on December 30, 2013, her sister found her dead in a ground floor bedroom at the rear of the house. A post-mortem examination revealed the grandmother had suffered significant head and facial injuries at the house in Smugglers Lane. Despite extensive investigations by police, her killer still remains at large. Forensic scientists have obtained a limited DNA profile for the murder suspect, which although not suitable for a search on the National DNA Database, indicates the suspect is male. A police officer stands outside the house where Valerie Graves was murdered on December 30 2013 . As well as being swabbed for their DNA, people volunteering also have their thumbprint and photograph taken. Detective Constable Steve Taylor from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team said: 'It is important for the public to understand that we will only use the samples obtained to check against this particular crime and their DNA profile will not appear on any database. 'Legal safeguards are in place to ensure we do not use them for any other purpose.'

"He was the despised ‘crookback’ king of Tudor legend, a murderous stage villain whose brief reign went down in infamy. Yet with the 2012 discovery of his mutilated remains in a Leicester car park, Richard III’s reputation has been transformed. And starting today comes a remarkable national celebration for the last English king to fall in battle. From the embroidered linen bags containing his tiny hands and feet, to the simple tomb carved in Swaledale rock, the five days of ceremony are packed with thought-provoking detail. Scroll down for video . Family connection: Coffin-maker Michael Ibsen, who is a distant relative of Richard III, alongside a reconstruction of the King . His final journey will start at 1.05pm today close to Bosworth Field where he was killed in 1485 before ending at Leicester Cathedral, where our last Plantagenet king will lie in repose until his burial on Thursday. Richard will be attended by his closest living relatives and peers descended from the noblemen who fought at Bosworth. The Queen will be represented by the Countess of Wessex and the Duke of Gloucester. Richard of York, who lost his crown to Lancastrian Henry Tudor, has been vilified as a tyrant. But many historians now regard him as a typical king in turbulent times. His skeleton had a large hole in the skull, and crucially, a curved spine, which is consistent with reports that Richard had a hunched back. Bosworth peer: The Earl and Countess of Derby.

Final journey begins at Bosworth Field and ends at Leicester Cathedral .
Richard will be buried on Thursday after he's attended by living relatives .
DNA analysis confirmed remains found in car park in 2012 were Richard’s .
Richard III’s coffin leaves Leicester University for Bosworth Field in a black Jaguar hearse, escorted by four police outriders and limousines, to start the preliminary leg of its journey. The oak coffin was made by Michael Ibsen, Richard’s nephew 17 times removed, whose family’s DNA was used to identify the King’s skeleton.
The bones have been packed in wool and Richard’s hands and feet have been placed in linen bags, embroidered with roses by children at Leicester’s Richard III Primary School. With the King is a wooden rosary, emblazoned with an enamelled White Rose. The skeleton is covered by a raw linen cloth, embroidered with York roses, by Elizabeth Noakes, of the Richard III Society.
The cortege officially departs Fen Lane farm. Close to Bosworth, this is where the battle was actually fought on August 22, 1485. Here Richard lost his crown and his life, when his army of 8,000 men was beaten by the Lancastrians, led by Henry Tudor. Archaeologists found more than 20 medieval cannon balls on the site.
The cortege will be joined by two knightly figures on horseback in 15th Century armour. They include Dr Tobias Capwell, curator of arms and armour at the Wallace Collection.
Richard’s body arrives at St James’ Church at Dadlington for prayers. Here many of the dead of Bosworth are buried. Henry VII paid for a chancery in the church.
Following the cortege is the 19th Earl of Derby, descendant of Lord Stanley, Richard’s Lord High Constable of England. He swung the battle by changing sides to support Henry, with his 3,000 men. Richard miscalculated Stanley’s loyalty – surprising since Stanley was married to Henry Tudor’s mother. ‘Stanley had by far the largest army on the field,’ said Lord Derby. ‘But he was in a very difficult position. The pillow talk was all about helping Henry. Richard took Stanley’s eldest son hostage and threatened to kill him. But Stanley said, “Sire, I have other sons.” Luckily, Richard never got the chance to behead him.’
After the battle, Stanley retrieved Richard III’s crown from a hedge and crowned Henry VII on the battlefield. Henry rewarded him by making him Earl of Derby, calling him ‘right dearly beloved father’.
Lord Derby is one of the ten ‘Bosworth peers’, whose ancestors fought at the battle, who will follow the coffin later today.
The cortege stops at St James’ Church, Sutton Cheney, where Richard heard his last Mass before battle. While his army camped the night before the battle on Ambien Hill, above Fenland Field, the King is said to have spent his last night on earth at Sutton Cheney Manor, which no longer exists.
Among the VIPs will be Dominic Smee, of Channel 4’s documentary Richard III: The New Evidence. By an enormous coincidence, Smee also suffers from scoliosis, the curvature of the spine that led Shakespeare to call Richard ‘a poisonous, bunch-backed toad’.
Dominic learned to ride and fight in a specially made suit of armour  and proved Richard could have been the great warrior of repute and that his scoliosis was hardly apparent when clothed.
Richard arrives at the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre where the coffin will be transferred to a wheeled bier. Covered with Richard’s Royal Standard, escorted by the two knightly riders, it will be drawn to the top of Ambien Hill for a Service of Commemoration.
As well as invited VIPs, more than 2,000 people have bought tickets for the event. Battlefield re-enactment society members will have held a dawn vigil in medieval dress. There will be exhibitions of medieval warfare, falconry, cooking and other aspects of medieval life. There will be a minute’s silence, then a 21-gun salute from eight medieval cannons. ‘It’s about reconciliation for the dead of both sides,’ said the Heritage Centre’s Richard Knox. ‘And to allow Richard to return from the battlefield with the dignity and honour that he was denied in 1485.’
The Battlefield Beacon will be lit – and it will burn until Richard is buried.
The coffin is transferred back to his hearse. The knightly outriders salute their King, as the motorised procession sets off for Leicester. The procession follows the route Richard took in 1485, through Market Bosworth, including crossing into Leicester over Bow Bridge – over which Richard led his troops to battle. Legend says his spur struck the bridge, and an old crone prophesied his head would hit the same stone.
On his return, Richard was slung naked over a horse, his hands tied together. Legend says that his broken skull did hit the same stone on the bridge. Trauma to his skeleton’s pelvic bone showed that someone stabbed him in the bottom.
Richard’s procession arrives back in Leicester, over Bow Bridge, across which he led his troops 530 years ago. The coffin will be transported into the medieval St Nicholas Church, where prayers will be said.
The coffin will then be transferred to a gun carriage drawn by four black horses and driven by a driver in traditional dress.
Accompanying them will be Jenny Gilbert, of undertakers Adkinsons. ‘We’re not having plumes or drapes,’ says Jenny. ‘It’s going to be simple. People said, “It’s not going to look like the Krays, is it?” ’Richard’s cortege will then make its way to Leicester Cathedral.
The remains of England’s last Plantagenet King will arrive at Leicester Cathedral. His cortege, flanked by the two knights in armour, will be escorted into the cathedral by the ‘Bosworth peers’.
The White Rose of York peers are the 18th of Norfolk, back from a family skiing holiday for the occasion; the 6th Baron Grey of Codnor; the Duke of Rutland; the 19th Viscount Hereford; and the Hon James Stourton, representing his brother, the 27th Baron Mowbray.
The Lancastrian Red Rose peers are the Earl of Derby; the 6th Baron Raglan; 29th Baron Herbert; 11th Earl De La Warr; and representatives of the 18th Earl of Devon and 8th Baroness Bray. ‘We’ve got Red Rose and White Rose, for Lancaster and York, because this service is about reconciliation,’ said the Dean, the Very Reverend David Monteith.
The coffin will be borne by members of the Armed Forces, including two senior NCOs from the 1st Regiment Prince of Wales, 1st Battalion Regiment of Fusiliers, and Royal Warrant officer first class from the Scots Guards.
Originally the Bosworth peers were going to carry the coffin – ‘but it’s lead-lined, so we thought it was too heavy,’ said a cathedral spokesman. The sermon will be given by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, as Richard was a Catholic.
More than 14,000 people from all over the world applied for the ticket ballot for the service. The 600-strong congregation is split between invited guests and the ballot winners. Those attending will include Wendy Daldig, Richard’s Australian niece 17 times removed. Her DNA, along with Michael Ibsen’s, was used to identify the King.
Richard’s remains in his coffin will lie in repose in the cathedral from today until Thursday so that members of the public may pay their respects.
On Thursday at 11am, England’s last Plantagenet King will be reburied in a service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
The Queen will be represented by the Countess of Wessex. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will also be present, as will the ‘Bosworth peers’, the original ten now swollen by other Plantagenet courtier families, including the Duke of St Albans and Lord Scrope. Many others whose ancestors fought at Bosworth have been invited too after they were tracked down by Leicester University’s Professor Kevin Schurer. It is hoped that actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is Richard’s nephew 17 times removed and who will be playing the King in the BBC’s forthcoming series of The Hollow Crown, will be at the service.
Richard will then be laid in a specially dug crypt in the centre of the cathedral, behind the altar. Overnight, his tomb, designed by the architects van Heinigen and Harward, will be constructed.
The tomb is made of slick modern Swaledale fossil stone block, deeply incised with a simple cross slashed into the stone. On top of a slab of black polished granite, carved with Richard’s boar badge, his coat of arms, is his motto ‘Loyaulte me lie’ – Loyalty binds me. White Roses of York have been set into the floor tiles around the tomb."

The local power company has a small army of technicians responsible for the maintenance of more than 300 electricity pylons that carry power from the dam and supply local requirements. The company does annual checks looking for problems every year, typically in spring when staff require a total of 10 days to visit each of the huge pylons and check the cables.

"Rail scam: Dr Peter Barnett (pictured outside court) faces jail after admitting to six counts of fraud by false representation . An international lawyer faces ruin after admitting dodging more than £23,000 in rail fares. Dr Peter Barnett, 43, was told he could be jailed after police discovered he spent more than two and a half years cheating the system. He gave himself up after being caught by a ticket inspector travelling from his home in an Oxfordshire market town to London’s Marylebone station. Investigators discovered the Oxford graduate and Rhodes scholar regularly pretended to have travelled from Wembley instead to save himself huge sums. The Australian-born lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children’s charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at ‘promoting prosperity’. On Friday, he pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates’ Court to six counts of fraud by false representation, carrying a maximum penalty of ten years in jail. The deception places him among the ranks of Britain’s biggest fare dodgers, closely behind a former millionaire fund manager. Jonathan Burrows was banned from working in the City last year after avoiding £43,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. He claimed to have travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a £550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. Jonathan Burrows (pictured left) became the biggest fare dodger in history after avoiding £43,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. Right, how the Mail reported the story in August 2014 . When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found that the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. It is understood that he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket. He then got off at Marylebone, tapping out with an Oyster card. Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which is currently £7.60. But this is still far less than the £19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home. It was the same ruse employed by Burrows, who was caught out when his train company realised he had not bought a season ticket since 2008. Barnett’s train operator, Chiltern Railways, claims he now owes them more than £23,000, which he has agreed to pay back. On Friday, prosecutor Zahid Hussain told the court: ‘Clearly, the distance between Wembley and Marylebone, where he was working, is far less than to his true home of Oxfordshire, and as such he has gained financially. ‘The financial loss to Chiltern Railways because of his fraudulent conduct is in excess of £23,000.’ He said Barnett had also ‘altered a photo-card to avoid detection’, adding: ‘It was planned. It was premeditated.’ Barnett gave himself up after being caught by a ticket inspector travelling from his home in an Oxfordshire market town to London’s Marylebone station (pictured) Barnett is the author of a book on international law and worked for a major London law firm before becoming a senior figure at Gerson Lehrman Group, an investment fund consultancy. The New York-based company said he left three years ago. He blamed ‘family problems’ for his behaviour and his lawyer said he showed ‘genuine remorse’. Saul Herman, defending, said the loss to the railway company was ‘much closer on my calculation to £7,500’ and asked for the figure to be reviewed. But he said his client was in a position to pay back all the cash, saying ‘a means form has been completed which shows compensation can be paid in the full amount’. Barnett was released on unconditional bail while a further assessment of how much he owes is made. He will be sentenced next month.","Dr Peter Barnett gave himself up after being caught by a ticket inspector .

"Miller High Life delivery guy Windell Middlebrooks died from a fatal blood clot that reached his lungs. The cause of the 36-year-old's death was a pulmonary embolism, but weight also was a contributing factor, according to TMZ. Middlebrooks, who was discovered at his his home in LA's San Fernando Valley on Monday morning, weighed 400lb which made him more vulnerable to health problems. The actor, best known for starring in the Miller High Life commercials, did not have significant medical issues prior to his death, according to his family. Scroll down for video .

A big hit: He was best known for playing the delivery man in the Miller High Life commercials, but was also on several TV shows including Parks And Recreation . On Thursday his Body of Proof co-star Geoffrey Arend gave a heartbreaking eulogy to Deadline. 'I will remember him as that once-in-a-lifetime type of person: an incredible actor, a gifted performer and a fantastic human being,' the 37-year-old New Yorker wrote. 'I truly believe he brought out the best in everyone around him. I know he did that for me. He will be missed.'

The 25-year-old was booked at the Cobb County Sheriff's Office and is being held on a $15,000 bond . The Good Samaritan followed him out the door and grabbed a handgun from his car, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. The man, who used to be in the military, ran after Katchem and tackled him to the ground. He ordered Katchem to stay on the pavement and held him at gunpoint until police could arrive on the scene. The alleged bank robbery occurred at a Wells Fargo in Marietta, Georgia, on Tuesday afternoon . A man witnessed what was happening outside the bank and took a photo, Fox 5 Atlanta reported.

"Iranian diplomats twice confronted their American counterparts about an open letter from Republican senators who warned that any nuclear deal could expire the day President Barack Obama leaves office, a senior U.S. official said Monday. The official, noting the administration's warnings when the letter first surfaced, said the GOP intervention was a new issue in the tense negotiations facing an end-of-month deadline for an agreement to reduce Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon in exchange for loosing Western sanctions. The letter came up in nuclear talks Sunday between senior U.S. and Iranian negotiators, the official said, and the Iranians raised it again in discussions Monday in Lausanne, Switzerland led by Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Scroll down for video . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, listens to Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, right, before resuming talks over Iran's nuclear program in Lausanne, Switzerland on Monday . Zarif was quoted by Iranian state media after the meeting as saying the topics included the potential speed of a softening of U.S. economic sanctions and the new issue of the letter from the senators. 'It is necessary that the stance of the U.S. administration be defined about this move,' he was quoted as saying. Kerry and Zarif met for nearly five hours in Lausanne, the start of several planned days of discussions. Most of the Iranians then departed for Brussels, where they were to meet with European negotiators. In Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that 'we are entering a crucial time, a crucial two weeks.' And German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that after 'more than ten years of negotiations, we should seize this opportunity.' The United States and Iran are plunging back into negotiations in a bid to end a decades-long standoff that has raised the specter of an Iranian nuclear arsenal, a new atomic arms race in the Middle East and even a U.S. or Israeli military intervention . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry takes a break during a bilateral meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif over Iran's nuclear program . 'There are areas where we've made progress, areas where we have yet to make any progress,' British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. 'But the fact that we're all here talking shows the commitment on both sides to try to reach an agreement.' In Lausanne, the U.S. official wouldn't say how much time the sides spent talking about the letter drafted seven days ago by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and signed by 46 other GOP senators. The Iranians have called the letter a propaganda ploy, and Zarif joked last week that some U.S. legislators didn't understand their own Constitution. The Obama Administration has called the letter 'ill timed' and 'ill advised,' coming weeks before the deadline for a preliminary agreement with Iran on its nuclear program. In the end, the talks and a potential agreement depend on Iran showing the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful, said the U.S. official, who briefed reporters only condition of anonymity. The goal for a full agreement is the end of June. U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, from left to right, pose for a photograph before resuming talks over Iran's nuclear program . Republicans argue that a deal would be insufficient and unenforceable, allowing Iran to eventually become a nuclear-armed state. To that end, they've delivered a series of proposals to undercut or block an agreement, including ones that would require Senate say-so on a deal and order new sanctions against Iran while negotiations are underway. Cotton's letter, the administration and congressional Democrats argue, went further, interfering in the president's execution of U.S. foreign policy. The letter, styled as a U.S. civics lesson, warned Iranian leaders that any deal negotiated by the current administration could be tossed by Obama's successor. Obama and other officials insist they're not going to make any deal that would allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. The agreement taking shape would limit Iran's uranium enrichment and other nuclear activity for at least a decade, with the restrictions slowly lifted over several years. From left, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, European Union High Representative Federica Mogherini, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and British Foreign Minister Philip Hammond stand for a group photo prior to a meeting in Brussels on Monday . Washington and other world powers also would gradually scale back sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. Tehran says it is only interested in peaceful energy generation and medical research, but much of the world suspects it harbors nuclear weapons ambitions. Kerry and Zarif plan to regroup in Lausanne on Tuesday. The U.S. secretary of state is to return to Washington by week's end for talks with Afghanistan's leaders, and the Iranians plan to break for the Persian New Year. Officials say talks might restart sometime next week, if necessary. A deal would also require the approval of America's negotiating partners: Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. With little time remaining before the end of March, some officials have said the persistent differences mean negotiators will likely settle for an announcement that they've made enough progress to justify further talks. Such a declaration would hardly satisfy U.S. critics of the Obama administration's efforts. But the senior American official said the goal was to determine by the end of March 'if we can get to a political framework that addresses the major elements of a comprehensive deal.'","The open letter from Republican senators warned that any nuclear deal could expire the day President Barack Obama's term ends .

"Horrified New Yorkers witnessed the grim reality of life in Syria as they viewed graphic photographs smuggled out of the war-torn country. An exhibition of gruesome torture images showing eye gougings, strangulation and the effects of long-term starvation, is being staged at the city's United Nations headquarters. About 25 pictures from a collection of 55,000 are on display this week, in an initiative sponsored by the US, Britain, France, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as the conflict in Syria moves into its fifth year. Some were visibly distressed as they viewed the horrific pictures, which were smuggled out of Syria between 2011 and mid-2013. Former war crimes prosecutors have described the images as 'clear evidence' of systematic torture and mass killings in Syria's three-year-long civil war. Scroll down for video . Distressing: A woman covers her mouth as she views shocking images sumggled out of Syria on display at the UN headquarters in New York . Shocked: Another visitor reacts after examining some of the 25 pictures of dead bodies in Syr . They were taken by a former military police photographer who has been identified by the code name 'Caesar'. Britain's UN Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said the aim of the exhibition was to raise awareness of the human rights abuses that President Bashar al-Assad's troops have been accused of committing against the Syrian people. 'As the conflict in Syria enters its fifth year, the number of those killed and displaced has reached 220,000 and 7.6million, and over 3.8million have been forced to flee the country,' Mr Lyall Grant said. 'We hope that this exhibition will serve as a reminder of the imperative to pursue a political solution to the conflict with utmost urgency to end the suffering of the Syrian people.' Syrian's UN Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari was not immediately available for comment on the photos. Caesar was a senior sergeant in Syria's army who spent 13 years working as a forensic photographer, say former war crimes prosecutors who examined the photos. Lawyers acting for Qatar commissioned the examination of the evidence. Qatar, like Saudi Arabia, is strongly opposed to Assad. Between September 2011 and August 2013, Caesar worked at a military hospital, taking photos of bodies from three detention centres in the Damascus area. He smuggled copies of those photos out of the hospital on memory sticks hidden in his shoe. The UN Security Council viewed the photos during an informal meeting last April. Russia and China vetoed a bid in May to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court for possible prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the civil war.

The UN representative of the Syrian National Coalition, Najib Ghadbian, told The Associated Press that Syria's representatives at the U.N. were welcome to attend, though the two sides do not speak to each other. When he saw the photos from the Caesar exhibit for the first time Friday in his office, Ghadbian said he sobbed. Speaking ahead of the exhibition, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said: 'Anyone who has seen the images will never forget them. 'Maimed bodies, people with their eyes gouged out, emaciated prisoners. It defies anybody's sense of humanity.' The exhibition comes as an international rights group announced Wednesday that more than 600 medical workers have been killed in Syria's civil war. Physicians for Human Rights said it has documented 233 attacks on 183 medical facilities across Syria since the country's conflict began in March 2011. In a report, it said that President Bashar Assad's government is responsible for 88 per cent of the recorded attacks on hospitals and 97 percent of the killings of medical workers. It documented 139 deaths directly attributable to torture and execution.The group's director of investigations Erin Gallagher said, ""every doctor killed or hospital destroyed leaves hundreds or even thousands of Syrians with nowhere to turn for health care.""

Britain needs between 45,000 and 60,000 extra lorry drivers, according to estimates. There is a long-running shortage caused by drivers retiring and too few young people choosing haulage as a career. And since September, all drivers must obtain the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence, completing an extra 35 hours training, costing some £500. Under the new rules, drivers who do not hold the new certificate face a fine of £1,000. As many as 20,000 drivers are thought to have quit or retired as a result. The Road Haulage Association wants Chancellor George Osborne to offer funding to train a new generation of drivers - especially women - in next month's Autumn Statement. New training rules mean the logistics industry is thousands of drivers short, according to the UK Commission for Employment and Skills.The Freight Transport Association claims more than 20,000 drivers have quit since September. It comes after a new Driver Certificate of Professional Competence was introduced across the EU, which meant drivers had to complete an extra 35 hours training, costing some £500. Hauliers say the rules mean there are not enough people to drive lorries across the country, raising the prospect of 'empty shelves'. Concerns have also been raised about safety, including the decision to allow 18-year-olds to drive HGVs. Ahead of the Budget the industry called for £150million to increase training for thousands of drivers before the shortages hit vital supplies. In his statement to MPs, Mr Osborne stopped short of announcing the money would be found. But the official Budget red book reveals the government could be ready to step in to provide support for road hauliers. It states: 'The government will review the speed with which Heavy Goods Vehicle (HVG) driving tests and driver medical assessments currently take place and consider options to accelerate both in order to help address the shortage of qualified HGV drivers. 'The government will also work with road haulage firms on an industry led solution to the driver shortage, including looking at the right level of access to, and funding support for, training.' Chancellor George Osborne used his Budget to announce a review of the HGV driving tests but stopped short of offering immediate financial support . Fuel duty has been frozen for a fifth year in succession, allowing the Chancellor to boast that motorists have had '£10 off a tank with the Tories'. Yesterday's move means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for September 1 will not go ahead. And the freezing of duty over the five years of the Coalition means the average driver spends £10 less per fill-up than if the controversial 'fuel-price escalator' had been implemented in full. Between 2011 and 2016, a typical motorist will have saved £675, the Treasury calculated. It means a saving of £1,400 for a small business with a van, and £21,000 for a haulier. Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett said: 'We have put forward a strong, clear argument for why funding is necessary and appropriate. Our lobby for funding support will be even stronger in the coming weeks.' A Department for Transport spokesman said: 'Increasing the number of qualified lorry drivers is good for British business and good for growth. The government will do all it can to find ways to support this sector and we are working to find industry-led solutions to ensure sufficient drivers to meet the demand.' Six weeks before Chrismtmas, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin urged people to 'get their shopping done' in case the driver shortage hit the supply of food and presents. He defended the new EU rules, arguing that drivers need to know how to drive their lorries properly. But he urged people not to leave their shopping until the last minute, in case supply lines are affected. 'If you're driving a motor vehicle, with the investment you've got in that motor vehicle, it's no bad thing to know what you're doing,' he told the ConservativeHome website. Asked if there were going to problems with deliveries before Christmas, he replied: 'I hope not. I hope not. I think we'll be all right. But I'd advise everybody to get their shopping done.'","Budget report promises review of the time it takes to get HGV licence .

"Teachers in a western Pennsylvania elementary school tried to ban a disabled girl from using a faculty bathroom by filing a grievance with the district's school board. The Steel Valley School Board voted unanimously without discussion on Thursday night to reject the complaint, according the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In the grievance filed February 13, the teachers union said allowing ten-year-old Kaitlin Montgomery to use the restroom on the lower level of Park Elementary School in Munhall violated the teachers' contract. The teachers union at Park Elementary School in Munhall, Pennsylvania, filed a grievance about Kaitlin Montgomery (left), pictured with her mother Tracy Montgomery (right), because she was using the faculty restroom on the school's lower level which violated their contracts . Kaitlin, a fourth grader, has chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension and foot problems, and is also autistic. There are no student bathrooms on the school's lower level, where Kaitlin's classroom is located . The grievance's solution was that Kaitlin would have had to go outside and up a flight of stairs to use the student bathroom . Eighteen female teachers, including two special education teachers, signed a petition that accompanied the grievance against the fourth grader, who has chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension and foot problems and is also autistic. The Steel Valley Education Association said the contract requires the district to provide 'lavatory facilities exclusively for employees', according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 'The bathrooms that have been designated as faculty bathrooms shall be exclusively used by the faculty,' the grievance said. The student's mother, Tracy Montgomery, told the board on Thursday that before she got permission to have her daughter use the faculty restroom, school officials said the girl would have to go outside and up a flight of stairs to use a student bathroom, which is what other students have to do. Kaitlin can't walk long distances, so her family uses a custom-made stroller for easier transportation. Because of her physical disabilities, Kaitlin cannot walk long distances and her family uses a custom-made stroller for transportation . Montgomery said that this is just one of Kaitlin's many issues at the school. Because there is no elevator from the school's lower level to the top levels, her daughter is unable to access the music and art rooms for classes . Montgomery found out about the grievance through a Post-Gazette article, after which she said she was 'embarrassed for the teachers and appalled. Steel Valley Education Association President Shawn McCallister said the grievance wasn't filed to prevent the student from using the restroom, the Post-Gazette reported, but to create 'a better outcome for all involved'. District Superintendent Ed Wehrer previously said federal law requires Steel Valley to meet the needs of students with disabilities. No other alternatives met the girl's needs, he said, and noted that the student is the only non-faculty member using the restroom. The school board said no alternatives to the faculty restroom met Kaitlin's needs, so she would be allowed into the bathroom, being the only non-faculty member using the facilities . The school board voted unanimously without discussion on Thursday night to allow Kaitlin to use the faculty bathroom . District official Diane Borges, who oversees pupil personnel and special services, had said the restroom on the lower level of the school in Munhall is the only one available. Another one located in a special education room is now taken up by a ventilation unit, according to WTAE. Borges said that two other faculty restrooms are in the school building and that she believes the district accommodations fulfill the teachers' contract. Montgomery said that this is only one of many problems Kaitlin faces in her school, saying that the lower level annex is two floors below the building elevator, so she won't be able to get to classes on higher levels including music and art. There are two other faculty restrooms for teachers to use at Park Elementary School. While there was a student bathroom on the lower level for Kaitlin to use in the special education room, it has been taken up by a ventilation unit .","Kaitlin Montgomery has chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension and foot problems and is also autistic .

"If you want the memory of your loved ones or family pets to live on you can now immortalise them as a tree. A Barcelona firm has designed a biodegradable urn that is planted in the ground and can be used to grow ash, oak, beech or gingko trees.

The urn is then buried in the ground and starts to biodegrade when the roots are strong enough to come into contact with the ashes. Mr Moline said it needs the same care as a standard tree, so needs to be planted somewhere with proper soil humidity and at least three hours of sunlight a day.

"Bags of dead dogs and roosters - believed to be from illegal animal fights - are being dumped alongside a suburban Dallas roadside. Local residents and animal rights activists have joined together to force the local police to attempt to discover the source of the gruesome fights - and try to put a halt to the brutal baiting. Some are more worried that local gangs are acting with impunity nearby and have complained about the safety of their children from those who dump the dead animals and from the rotting, disease-ridden carcasses. Gruesome: Inside this bag are the dismembered bodies of dead dogs and roosters that are turning up alongside southeast Dallas highways . 'My daughters live right here, my son,' said a man who spoke to CBS News and wished to be identified only as Michael. 'If they'll do that to a dog, what will they do to a human?' Michael said that he usually finds stray dogs lining the roadside but recently he and another animal rescuer saw someone throw bags from a pickup truck. 'It was the bags with all the dead dogs, mush, decomposed bodies, roosters, matted hair. It was hor-I mean, it stunk. You can imagine how it smelled,' said Michael to CBS. Gross: Locals fear that a gang-related animal fighting ring is dumping the dead bodies along the Dallas road . Strays: Dogs are usually left by their owners along the stretch of road - but now dead dogs are turning up - much to local residents disgust . On another day Michael found bags full of dead chickens and then sadly, more dogs. 'It was something you might see in a horror movie,' said Michael to CBS.

However, a local Dallas Police Department spokesman said that they are working with animal control to find the culprits.","Residents of southeast Dallas are finding bags filled with dismembered dogs and roosters .

"Along with Coco Chanel and Elsa Schiaparelli, she towered high for decades as one of the pillars of French fashion. Now iconic designer Jeanne Lanvin, who died in 1946, will be honoured in a new exhibition opening this week at the Paris City Fashion museum at the Palais Galliera. The show will be inaugurated by Paris' Mayor Anne Hidalgo and celebrates Lanvin being the oldest fashion house still operating in France, now under the creative direction of Alber Elbaz. Dresses by Jeanne Lanvin featured in the new exhibition opening this week at the Paris City Fashion museum at the Palais Galliera reveal her love of vibrant colours . Lanvin opened her bridal department in 1909 and her gowns became popular with prestigious customers who favoured her designs, pictured, using ivory silk chiffon embroidered with pearls and gold metallic threads . Lanvin, pictured in Paris in 1938, used travel diaries, swatches of ethnic fabrics and a vast library of art books to feed her curiosity and inspire her to create different patterns and designs . It's a rich legacy has spanned the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries and the new exhibition charts the rise of the company founded by Lanvin after she opened her first store in 1889. The designer was born in Paris in 1867 and after training to be a dressmaker, she then became a milliner with dreams of opening her own fashion house. After she made her dream a reality, she was a pioneering working mother as she established her business whilst caring for daughter, Marguerite. The displays in the new exhibition, which will run till 23 August, reveal her love of colour and the Asian influences seen in her embroidery and decorative work. 'My Fair Lady' from 1939 features a large bias-cut ribbon that stands out against the white fabric of the dress . An absinthe green silk satin dress from the twenties, embroidered with glass beads and Swarovski crystals . There are more than one hundred pieces in the exhibition that reveals how Lanvin's rich legacy has spanned the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries . It will feature more than a hundred exhibits from the collections of the Palais Galliera and the Lanvin Heritage, revealing how Lanvin could lend her creative talent to children's clothes, bridal wear and accessories. In 1927, she celebrated her daughter Marguerite's thirtieth birthday with the creation of the legendary perfume Arpège. The famous logo designed by Paul Iribe, depicting the couturière with Marguerite, is displayed on the round bottle created by Armand Rateau. The same logo is still featured on Lanvin creations to this day. Lanvin used travel diaries, swatches of ethnic fabrics and a vast library of art books to feed her curiosity and inspire her to create fabrics, patterns and exclusive colours - with her favourite shade a blue that become known as Lanvin blue. A attendee admires the My Fair Lady gown that was inspired by French 18th century-style dresses . By the thirties, Lanvin was championing high waisted dresses with belts like this one for a smart, tailored but still feminine look . Her styles helped set the trends across the decades from ample skirts in the early 20th century to Art Deco designs in the twenties. Nadja Swarovski, member of the Swarovski executive board who are supporting the exhibition, said: 'We are honoured to partner with the Palais Galliera in supporting the first retrospective dedicated to Jeanne Lanvin, one of the greatest figures of Parisian haute couture. 'Swarovski was founded in 1895, just six years after Mme Lanvin established her house, and she used crystals to adorn the luxuriously embellished evening gowns which became her trademark. 'This inspiring exhibition pays tribute to the skill, inventiveness and creativity of a great artist who captured and expressed the spirit of her time, and celebrates over 125 years of extraordinary fashion heritage which continues to thrive under Alber Elbaz.' Lanvin had a taste for black and white designs with geometrical effects  - a trend which dominated the thirties . The exhibition will be open until 23 August and Lanvin's current creative director Alber Elbaz hopes people will come away saying ""I love Jeanne Lanvin"" Elbaz himself commented: 'For this exhibition, we began to look at the clothes, the dresses, the inside of the dresses, and the feelings that we picked up from them. The whole question was to work out how to display them. 'For many years I've worked on the windows of our boutiques, and I love doing it. But doing an exhibition in a museum is a different kind of undertaking, because it involves a different vocabulary. 'Never having done an exhibition, I wanted to learn all I could from Olivier Saillard and his team. We had two options: either to be historical and do a very academic retrospective with a succession of dates; or to follow our feelings, to love and admire the clothes, touch the visitors’ heart through the sheer beauty of these garments, and finish the exhibition kind of up on a cloud. 'I think we have managed to create an exhibition around the dream of fashion. What I am hoping for is to hear the visitors say ""I love Jeanne Lanvin"".'","Jeanne Lanvin, who died in 1946, will be honoured in a new exhibition .

Al Shabaab was pushed out of the capital by African peacekeeping forces, but have waged a series of gun and grenade attacks, looking to overthrow the government and impose its strict version of sharia law on the country. An offensive launched last year by African Union forces along with the Somali army has driven the group out of its strongholds in central and southern Somalia, while a series of U.S. drone strikes have killed some of its top leaders.

"Emergency drug laws are being rushed through in Ireland after possession of ecstasy was temporarily legalised as a result of a court striking down a ban on another substance. Parliamentarians will sit into the night to pass legislation quickly after the Court of Appeal's ruling temporarily makes legal the possession of the party drug, along with benzodiazepines and some so-called head shop drugs. Health minister Leo Varadkar said he is working to pass the emergency laws within 24 hours. 'We had no way of knowing what the court would decide today, but we prepared for this possibility,' he said. The possession of ecstasy is temporarily legal in Ireland because of the knock-on effect caused by a Court of Appeal ruling striking down a ban on methylethcathinone . The move was necessary after a decision by the Court of Appeal on a challenge to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The case dealt with the powers of the Government to control substances harmful to human health. The three-judge court unanimously said a regulation making the possession of methylethcathinone - also known as 4-mec or snow blow - illegal was invalid. Because of the way the laws are drawn up, the ruling had the knock-on effect of temporarily legalising the possession of some other drugs. The Dublin government said the outcome of the case did not affect existing laws on heroin, cocaine or cannabis. While the case dealt with the legality of possession of named substances, their sale and supply remains an offence. 'Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by cabinet,' said Mr Varadkar. 'The emergency legislation I am introducing today will re-instate the status quo and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment.' Irish health minister for Health Leo Varadkar is working to pass the emergency laws within 24 hours.

"While the days of turning up to the Qantas lounge in thongs and a singlet may be over for some, other Australians will be exempt from the newly enforced dress codes. Last month it was announced that visitors to the lounge 'meet the appropriate standard' of attire, and while the rules have been in place for many years would actually be enforced from April 1 this year. However travellers in Darwin, Cairns and the Gold Coast will still be able to don their weekend barbeque best for the lounges. Qantas head of domestic product and service Helen Gray told the NT News the rule would be 'a friendly ­reminder' at lounges in Perth, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide. Qantas lounges have always had dress codes but they have not been strictly enforced before . Now the airline will enforce it, except in Darwin, Cairns and the Gold Coast . Darwin travellers told the publication they did not think Qantas would be able to enforce the dress code in the Northern Territory even if they tried. One man even admitted he didn't think he owned 'smart casual' attire. Last month the airline announced its lounge staff will soon be ensuring visitors to Qantas will be keeping a closer eye on what you are wearing and will only allow you into their fancy waiting areas if you wearing 'smart casual' clothing from now April 1. However, the airline has refused to define exactly what is and is not allowed to be worn and each customer will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Signs will be put up outside the Qantas lounges  highlighting the policy. Helen Gray, Qantas' Head of Domestic Product & Service, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From April 2015, customers entering domestic Qantas Clubs and Business Lounges in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney will receive a friendly reminder about the smart casual dress guidelines that apply.' People wearing thongs will probably no longer be allowed in the Qantas lounges around Australia . If you have ever wanted to experience Qantas business class you'll have to dress the part . 'The vast majority of our members meet and exceed the guidelines, but we have had some feedback from customers that they want to see those guidelines apply to everyone. 'The dress guidelines for our lounges are the same as most restaurants and clubs.' Playing the role of bouncers, Qantas staff is allowed to use their 'discretion' to determine if a visitor to the lounge meets the smart casual dress guidelines.' Singlets, bare feet, and rubber thongs 'in most cases' will be deemed unacceptable in capital city  lounges. This will be the first time the dress code – which has always existed – is actively enforced. The decision has reportedly been made after feedback from customers concerned about the style inside the expensive lounges. High-vis clothing and work attire will still be allowed. Men and women are encouraged to dress in smart casual attire if they want to get into the Qantas lounges . High-vis clothing and work uniforms will still be allowed in the lounges . It's unlikely this woman would get through the doors into the Qantas lounges from now on . The move comes after the airline announced they would be opening the doors to the business class lounge to people who never had the money or the points to use it before. They announced this week that customers will be able to combine their cash and air miles to experience how the other half fly. Frequent flyers who have points coming out of their ears have no need to panic about ending up in cattle class as the points-only upgrades will be processed first before the online bidding begins. However, economy passengers can only get involved in the Bid Now Upgrades if they receive an invite via an email seven days before departure. Bidder's offers can be modified or cancelled at any time up until 24 hours before departure, but passengers don't see each other's offers. Passengers will be notified via email about one day before departure about whether their offer has been successful - and if not, they are not out of pocket and keep their original seat. Overly revealing clothes will not be allowed in the Qantas business lounge from April 1 . Frequent flyers who have points coming out of their ears have no need to panic about ending up in cattle class as the points-only upgrades will be processed first before the online bidding begins . The minimum points needed are from 3,000 for a domestic upgrade and from 5,000 for an international upgrade with a minimum dollar amount also required. Qantas Loyalty CEO Lesley Grant said the system is designed for passengers who don't have a balance high enough to request an upgrade using points alone. 'For a member who doesn't have enough points to submit an upgrade request for their whole family, Bid Now Upgrades offers an alternative chance to travel at the front of the plane with their spouse and children using a combination of money and points,' she said. Ms Grant said the new system will not change the process or priority for frequent flyers submitting Classic Upgrade Rewards more than 24 hours out from their scheduled departure. 'This new initiative will in no way impact the chances of members securing a Classic Upgrade Reward - these will always be confirmed first regardless of their Frequent Flyer tier and they remain the best value option,' she said. Bidder's offers can be modified or cancelled at any time up until 24 hours before departure, but passengers don't see each other's offers .","Qantas lounge's 'smart casual' dress code will now be enforced by staff .

"Lillo Brancato, who played a mobster in HBO's The Sopranos, has landed his first Hollywood movie role following his eight-year prison stint for his part in the murder of a cop. The 38-year-old has started working on the film 'Back in the Day', which tells the story of a Brooklyn boxer taken in by a mobster, the New York Post first reported. In the movie, which stars Alec Baldwin, Danny Glover and Mike Tyson, Brancato plays the cousin of one of the boxer's opponents and gets into a scuffle with the lead character. The role comes more than a year after he was released from prison. He served eight years for a botched robbery in the Bronx in which an off-duty police officer was shot dead. Scroll down for video . New role: Lillo Brancato (pictured second right with, from left, actor Joe D'Onofrio, actor and producer William DeMeo and director Paul Borghese) has landed a role in 'Back in the Day' about a fighter from Brooklyn . In December 2005, Brancato tried to break into an apartment with Steven Armento, a low-level mobster and the father of his girlfriend, to steal Valium but NYPD officer Daniel Enchautegui heard glass break as they entered the building and confronted them. While Enchautegui waited for backup, a gun battle erupted and he was fatally shot in the chest. Armento was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Brancato was found not guilty of murder but was convicted of robbery and sentenced to nine years in prison minus time served. He was released on December 31, 2013. After leaving prison, he was given his second chance by William DeMeo, who wrote 'Back in the Day', and is also producing and starring in the movie. 'I know a lot of people were nervous about hiring someone who had a tainted past,' DeMeo told the Post. 'I could tell deep down in my heart that he changed. I wanted to give him a second chance.' Locked up: Brancato was sent to prison for his part in the death of off-duty police officer Daniel Enchautegui, right. Brancato and another man were breaking into an apartment when the man shot Enchautegui . Scene: Police investigate the crime scene in the Bronx on Saturday 10, 2005, where the officer was shot . Brancato, who has been sharing behind-the-scene snaps on his Instagram page, first met DeMeo while they were both going for a role in the 2001 film, 'Boss of Bosses', which DeMeo ultimately secured. DeMeo said that he called a friend in the NYPD to ask him whether he would be offended if he hired the ex-con, but the friend said it was no problem. But the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association in New York, J. Lynch, told TMZ that he would not be so forgiving. 'We ask all right-thinking people not to support this thug’s acting career by avoiding this movie and any project in which he is involved,' he said. As for Brancato, the actor said he's particularly excited about working with Mike Tyson, saying: 'He's had such an interesting life. He also was incarcerated, so a lot of things are similar.' The actor is best known for his role in the 1993 movie 'A Bronx Tale, starring Robert De Niro, and for playing Matthew Bevilaqua in The Sopranos. Rise to fame: Brancato is best known for his role in the 1993 Robert De Niro film, 'A Bronx Tale' On screen: He also played dim-witted mobster Matthew Bevilaqua in HBO show The Sopranos . After his release, he also appeared in the small independent movie, 'Monsters of Mulberry Street', in which he played a priest. 'I said I don't think it would be a wise decision for me right now to play anything of violence, I don't think it sends the right message,' he told This is 50 as he explained his decision to take the job. He has also expressed his remorse about his role in the 2005 killing. 'I wish I could just take it back and I could bring police officer Daniel back to life,' Brancato told ET after he left prison. 'He was a hero. He was off-duty, lived next door, heard broken glass, came out and put his life on the line.' And last month, he shared his mug shot to Instragram, calling it 'a time in my life when things weren't going too well'. 'I took a lot from a negative experience and have grown in a positive way as a result of it #learnedmylesson,' he wrote.

"Throughout 2014, £1,860 a day was spent on Bristol City Council procurement cards including £686 on iTunes downloads . Staff at a council used payment cards to spend nearly £700,000 of public cash – including £170 on a pair of designer Ugg boots, £100 in a Ralph Lauren store in Barcelona and £44 in a tattoo parlour. The cards are intended for expenses including travel, office supplies and catering. But thousands of pounds were spent on fast food, iTunes and shopping trips abroad last year. Throughout 2014, £1,860 a day was spent on Bristol City Council procurement cards, figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show. Overall, £680,000 was spent by council workers, with more than £4,200 on eating out, £9,664 for hotels at home and abroad, £37,894.11 online at Amazon and £686 on iTunes downloads. The 'outrageous' spending even included Gay Times magazine, Krispy Kreme and fishing tackle. The council insisted the figure for a one-off £189.50 payment to Gay Times magazine was incorrect, and it actually spent £33 on a subscription to Diva magazine, a lesbian magazine, for its library service. A council spokesman said £32,400 spent in Asda paid for groceries to support people in respite care, and £10,000 spent in Ikea was to support tenants in high-needs accommodation. It failed to provide a proper explanation for £170 spent on a pair of designer UGG boots, £100 in a Ralph Lauren store in Barcelona and £44 in a tattoo parlour. Procurement cards are given to senior managers, some school heads, managers of care homes or social workers who need to supply goods to vulnerable people. Councillor Geoff Gollop, deputy mayor, said: ‘We have processes in place to reassure ourselves that corporate cards are used appropriately. 'What you see is a council running its business, supporting vulnerable people and helping those who don’t always enjoy the same advantages as others.’ 'Outrageous': Staff at Bristol City Council used payment cards to spend nearly £700,000 of public cash – including £170 on a pair of designer Ugg boots . Despite trying to defend the spending, the use of procurement cards has been slammed. Chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance Jonathan Isaby said some of the payments revealed in the figures were 'outrageous'. He said: 'The council must come clean about why these payments have been made, because they appear to be totally inappropriate. 'Taxpayers hand over their hard-earned money to the council for essential services - not for swanky restaurants, trips to the office and snooker outings. 'It is outrageous that taxpayers' money is being used in this way and the council must hold people accountable for the spending.' Local Government Minister Kris Hopkins said: 'Bristol City Council should be focusing its efforts on making sensible savings to keep Council Tax down and improve frontline services.'","Bristol City Council staff used cards to spend nearly £700k of public money .

"A mother-of-one has argued that parents should be doing more to teach their children about sex following the news that pupils as young as 11 will be taught the difference between rape and consensual sex in schools. Education secretary Nicky Morgan said the proposed lessons (which schools and parents can choose to opt in to) will better prepare pupils for life in modern Britain. The question over whether such lessons are appropriate led to a heated debate on today's This Morning as two women appeared to share their opposing views. Scroll down for video . Mother-of-one Sonia Poulton shared her views on modern parenting on today's This Morning, pictured . Mother-of-one Sonia Poulton, 50, a journalist from London, argued that the onus should not be on schools to teach children such issues around sex education. Rather, she believes parents should be taking much more responsibility. She said: 'I think it's entirely inappropriate the kind of conversations we are allowing strangers to have with our children. If anybody needs to be having sex education lessons it's parents. 'Children are becoming sexualised earlier and there is plenty a parent can do. First of all, start parenting again. Parents have handed their children over to computers and smart phones to raise them. They have taken their foot off the pedal and that is the issue. 'Children are seeing ""pop porn"" from Rihanna and Nicki Minaj and we need to be telling children in schools - if anything at all about sex education - that's it's about relationships and respecting yourself. Anna Williamson, 33, a Childline counsellor, believes it's never too early for children to talk about sex . 'We are thrusting them into this sexualised world when we don't need to.' She added on the issue of teaching the difference between rape and consensual sex in schools: 'We should not be normalising this for children. I am an open-minded mum and I sexually educated my daughter because I am the safest person to do it.' However, TV presenter Anna Williamson, 33, from London, who is a Childline counsellor, said she believes it's never too early for children to talk about sex education. She said: 'The key word about this is age appropriate. It's not about storming into a classroom and giving children a barrage of information that as adults we find difficult to take in. 'It's gently starting that conversation and getting schools on board and parents taking responsibility too so it's a three way conversation. 'We know at Childline that there is a deficit (in sex education) between the ages of six and 11 so these children don't have the tools and the know how - or where to ask for help - or to know what is wrong.' She said that having a proper syllabus is vital to keep children safe and to stop them being misinformed and then spreading myths about sex in the playground. Under Morgan's proposal, pupils are to be taught from the age of 11 about the difference between rape and consensual sex. The two women debated the issue raised by education secretary Nicky Morgan with TV presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden . The lessons, which could come in as soon as after the Easter holidays, will be based on a series of resources being developed by the PSHE Association. Writing in The Sunday Times to mark International Women's Day, the Conservative MP said: 'We have to face the fact that many pressures girls face today were unimaginable to my generation and it's our duty to ensure that our daughters leave school able to navigate the challenges and choices they'll face in adulthood. 'Our commitment to supporting women should start long before they take home their first wage. We have to ensure that the education girls receive not only allows them to reach their academic potential, but also prepares them for life in modern Britain.' The recommended materials, which she has stressed will be age appropriate, are aimed at giving teachers more confidence and better guidance to teach difficult subjects. The sex education lessons will be based on a series of resources being developed by the PSHE Association . Nicky Morgan has said 'it's our duty to ensure that our daughters leave school able to navigate the challenges and choices they'll face in adulthood' Thousands of This Morning viewers took to the show's Facebook page to join in the debate. Carla Pointing said she agreed with Anna's points and welcomes the move to change sex education in schools. She wrote: 'Think that's a great idea. In an ideal world it wouldn't have to happen at all but it's good to educate children on the difference and make them aware in an age appropriate way. 'I'd be more than happy for my child to be taught about this at school.' Toni Greenacre also believes it's a good idea. She said: 'They should be taught that anything under the age of 16 is wrong too. If they don't know, then how will they speak out about it?' But Samantha Roythorne thinks 11 is too young for children to be taught about rape. She said: '11-year-olds should not know what sex is. You can protect your children from horrible people without going into detail. 'I would be mortified if my daughter found out what sex was at that age! Sex is for adults not children!' Leanne Marie Christie agreed saying she thinks the proposal takes away childhood innocence. She said: 'How can an 11-year-old process the feelings and emotions that go along with this conversation, we moan about the state our country is in yet we give children responsibilities and emotions they can't deal with and wonder why they are stressed, self harming and having mental health problems it's ridiculous! They are only children for a short time lets let them be innocent!'","Education secretary Nicky Morgan has new plans for sex education .

"A young wildlife photographer with Down's Syndrome has captured a series of stunning images of the natural world thanks to his unique view of the world. Oliver Hellowell's incredible photographs have already earned him an abundance of fans around the world, with his Facebook page gaining more than 53,000 'likes.' The 18-year-old's mother Wendy O'Carroll believes it is her son's condition that allows him to see  the beauty in the world that the ordinary eye might miss. Love birds: A pair of mute swans at Abbotsbury Swannery, in Dorset, are captured by photographer Oliver Hellowell who was Down's Syndrome . Young snapper Oliver, from Somerset captured these stunning images, including this one of the incredibly still Loch Lairig in Eala Perthshire . Wendy, who lives with Oliver in Somerset, explained it was her son's attention to detail which helped to make his photography so striking. She said: 'I think his success is clearly down to his story, as well as the quality of his images and his 'eye' for a picture. 'He enjoys taking pictures of 'pieces' of things or anything which really catches his eye- a yellow leaf on a dark background, water splashing at the edge of a waterfall, or ripples of water which catch the light. 'He will take pictures of almost anything that catches his eye. The 18-year-old photographer who  loves to capture the natural world and particularly enjoys photographing birds such as this Great Grey Owl at ICBP Newent . Oliver's mother believes his condition means that her son sees the world differently from most people and gives a unique insight into capturing the natural world (pictured is River Morrow at Skenfrith Castle, Abergavenny, Wales) Just over a year ago, mother Wendy O'Carroll (right) set up a Facebook page for the 18-year-old Oliver's photography which has been gaining in popularity . Oliver, pictured snapping a new set of shots with his camera, hopes that photography - particularly of birds - can become his full-time profession . 'What he finds and sees as interesting or beautiful, is so frequently something which others may not, or which most of us walk straight past without even noticing.' The youngster, who is well on his way to becoming a professional photographer, is now in the process of signing a book deal to showcase his images. Wendy said her son particularly enjoyed taking photos of wild, country landscapes and has a particular affinity with birds which allows him to capture some incredible shots. 'He loves birds for example and will sit in a hide for periods of time to catch some good bird shots, and enjoys going to places like the ICBP in Newent where he can get close to the birds of prey and get some excellent close-up shots,' said his mother. His passion also allows him freedom as his Wendy claimed that his condition meant that all through his life he has been restricted far more than ordinary children and young people. Blue or gold? The teenager is well on his way to fulfilling his dream of becoming a fully fledged phototgrapher with this stunning image of a waterfall with golden flecks on the Tarr Stepps, Exmoor . This cheeky robin appeared to have no fears in posing for the young snapper at Greylake RSPB reserve near Oliver's home in Somerset . Oliver's great eye for a picture, such as these daisies have earned him an abundance of fans around the world and more than 53,000 likes on Facebook . The 18-year-old enjoys taking photos of wild, country landscapes, with some of his favourite locations in Wales and Scotland, and birds such as this egret at Greylake RSPB reserve . 'When he is taking photographs he can take pictures of whatever he wants, without anyone saying 'don't do that' or 'don't go there' or 'let me do that for you' or 'no that's not right let me show you how,' she added. 'He has complete power over his subject matter, the time he spends on it and if he's happy with his picture then that's the most important thing. 'He can also take pictures which he knows other people will like and is pleased and proud to be able to 'show' those -so photography as well as bringing him more independence also brings him self-esteem and confidence.' The youngster, who is well on his way to becoming a professional photographer, is now in the process of signing a book deal to showcase his images including this of the flooded RSPB reserve in January 2014 . The talented photographer enjoys taking pictures of anything that catches his eye such as this close up of a bramble leaf . Wendy said her son particularly enjoyed taking photos of wild, country landscapes and has a particular affinity with birds which allows him to capture some incredible shots . This scenes captures the changing of the seasons as the trees' summer leaves turn a variety of colours- reds, yellows and browns and create a carpet on the forest floor . Oliver had his first exhibition in November 2012, and the talented photographer has gone onto display at several more, including an exhibition at Westonzoyland hall in Somerset. Wendy hopes that others with Down's Syndrome, as well as aspiring photographers, will be inspired by Oliver's achievements. 'Hopefully they will think: 'Gosh if a young lad with Down 's Syndrome can do that with a camera imagine what I might be able to do?!' 'Several photographers find that they get ideas from Oliver's work and his unusual angles, and find themselves getting great images when they try something that they saw Oliver doing - so all in all, everyone's a winner!' adds Wendy. A style at Thurlbear Woods near Taunton in Somerset is captured in detail by the talented young snapper who was born with Down's Syndrome . Oliver loves getting back to nature and uses his unique wolrd view to capture stunning pictures such as the white Spring blossom .

"Captain Donald Malcolm Jr lived a magnificent life, so it's only fitting that his family would choose to memorialize him in a legendary way when the 60-year-old Alaska fisherman died last month. In an obituary published in the Homer Tribune, Malcolm's daughter Megan inspires both tears and laughter by writing that her father passed away on February 28 'nestled in the bosom of his family, while smoking, drinking whiskey and telling lies.' 'He died from complications resulting from being stubborn, refusing to go to the doctor, and raising hell for six decades. Stomach cancer also played a minor role in his demise,' Megan Malcolm added. Remembered with a laugh: Captain Donald Malcolm Jr (pictured) died last month at the age of 60. The Alaska fisherman's family memorialized him in a hilarious and touching obituary . The obituary goes on to tell the story of Malcolm's life, starting with his upbringing in Kirkland, Washington. At the age of 19, Malcolm left his home state for Dutch Harbor, Alaska in order to realize his life's calling to 'yell at deckhands on commercial fishing boats.' For forty years, Malcolm worked as a boat cook, mechanic, deckhand, captain and boat owner catching crab, halibut, black cod and salmon - mostly out of the Bering Sea. It was after a crab-fishing trip that he met his wife Maureen, who he found 'in his bed' and decided to keep. Perfect imperfections: Malcolm's daughter Megan wrote the obituary, in which she wrote that her father died 'nestled in the bosom of his family, while smoking, drinking whiskey and telling lies.' Malcolm pictured above with wife Maureen . Adding intrigue to the obituary, Megan writes that 'their daughter Melissa was born ""early"" six months later.' 'They decided to have a boy a couple years later, and ended up with another daughter, Megan,' the younger daughter writes of her perhaps slightly disappointing entrance into the world. While he taught his daughters everything he knew: from how to hold their liquor to changing a car tire, Megan writes that his 'greatest joy in life was the birth of his grandson Marley, a child to whom he could impart all of his wisdom that his daughters ignored'. Beloved: Though he was proud of his two daughters, Megan writes that her father's 'greatest joy in life was the birth of his grandson Marley, a child to whom he could impart all of his wisdom that his daughters ignored' 'Don had a life-time love affair with Patsy Cline, Rainier beer, iceberg lettuce salads and the History Channel (which allowed him to call his wife and daughters everyday in order to relay the latest WWII facts he learned),' the obituary continues. 'He excelled at attempting home improvement projects, outsmarting rabbits, annoying the women in his life and reading every book he could get his hands on. 'His life goal was to beat his wife at Scrabble, and although he never succeeded, his dream lives on in the family he left behind.' After the obituary was published on  Wednesday, daughter Megan posted a link on her Facebook and wrote about the emotions behind the piece. Author: Megan Malcolm (right) posted a link to the obituary on her Facebook and wrote that it was one of the hardest things she's ever had to do. 'However, it does allow you the chance to inject a bit of humor into an otherwise entirely awful situation' 'Writing it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do and I wouldn't wish the task on anyone. However, it does allow you the chance to inject a bit of humor into an otherwise entirely awful situation,' Megan Malcolm wrote. 'I hope reading Papa M's obituary makes you smile and remember what an incredible man he was. He was the absolute best, and he will be missed.' Malcolm is survived by his wife, daughters, grandson, father Donald Malcolm Sr, brothers Howard and Mike Malcolm, sisters Lisa Shumaker, Nicki White, Melinda Borg and Patsi Solano.","Captain Donald Malcolm Jr died from stomach cancer last month at 60 .

"They were worlds apart in life. Heath Ledger, a Hollywood actor. Simon Millington, a qualified auto-electrician and the son of duck farmers from country Victoria. But both men, the doting fathers of little girls, died just years apart from the same phenomenon - the abuse of prescription drugs, described as an epidemic in Australia by anti-drug abuse groups. Now Kim Ledger, the late Academy Award winner's father, has joined an effort to fight prescription drug abuse after he was moved by a 'heartwrenching' letter from Simon's mother, Margaret. The letter said Simon 'wanted to stay well for Maddie', his young daughter, 'but the hideous disease of addiction slowly crept back up again' and he died of a pain medication overdose in 2010. 'His life mattered,' Margaret wrote, 'and that is why I do what I do for others in similar circumstances.' Scroll down for video . Rest in peace: Heath Ledger, pictured, died after consuming six pharmaceutical medications in August 2008 . 'His life mattered': Simon Millington, pictured here with his young daughter Maddie, died in 2010 after a sixteen year fight with prescription drugs which he became addicted to after being caught in a car accident in August 1994 . Accomplished actor: Heath Ledger 'immersed' himself in the role of the Joker, his father has said, in preparation for his role in The Dark Knight (pictured). He was posthumously awarded an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor after the performance and his death . Kim Ledger, Heath's father, has been involved in efforts to increase awareness about the dangers of prescription drug abuse since his son's death in August 2008. His latest position is as Patron of the not-for-profit Scriptwise . Mr Ledger's own son accidentally died around two years earlier after he consumed a lethal cocktail of six prescription medications. The 28-year-old actor was found dead in his Manhattan apartment, shortly after completing filming for The Dark Knight, where he starred as The Joker. 'He was just desperately trying to get to sleep,' Mr Ledger said. After receiving the emotional letter from Margaret and John Millington from Nhill, Victoria, and hosting a follow-up meeting with them last year, Mr Ledger today announced he will be the patron of the new not-for-profit Scriptwise, which will raise awareness about the dangers and solutions to prescription drug abuse. 'I met Margaret and John Millington last year... Margaret had reached out to me about maybe a year earlier or so with a little note, a letter really, a lovely letter that was quite compelling,' he said. 'It was explaining what they had to go through (with Simon). It was really quite heartwrenching.' In a statement, Mr Ledger said his son's profile was probably 'a little higher than many other loved ones' who had experienced tragic deaths from prescription drug abuse. 'If something positive can come from (Heath's) passing such as raising awareness of the problem and moving towards some form of live monitoring for prescription medication, then my job is done.' Margaret and John have lobbied the government in favour of measures to crack down on prescription drug abuse since Simon's death. Simon had grappled with an addiction to pain medication for some sixteen years, Mrs Millington told Daily Mail Australia, following a devastating car accident in August 1994, when he was just 18-years-old. Heath Ledger was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in the film The Dark Knight, following his stellar performance . Simon Millington was caught in a car accident in 1994. As a result of his accident and his recovery, Mr Millington became addicted to pain killers and other medications, including 'benzos and opiates', his mother said . Mr Ledger said: 'They've done a great job - others around them have too - but those people who were the ones who influenced me enough to get involved in the project.' Mrs Millington told Daily Mail Australia she was touched by the praise from Mr Ledger. 'We caught up with him in Perth late last year,' Mrs Millington said. 'We've spent a lot of time sharing our stories about our sons... 'There's often times only the people who have been through it understand what we've been going through.' Heath Ledger died of an overdose in August 2008 after consuming a lethal cocktail of six different prescription medications. Mr and Mrs Millington have worked hard to raise awareness about prescription drug abuse in regional Victoria. They are lobbying for a mandatory national Real Time Monitoring System to help stem the epidemic. Scriptwise said pharmaceutical drugs were linked to 82 per cent of overdose deaths in Victoria in 2013 alone. For the past three years I have been a volunteer on the Wimmera Drug Action Task Force, the subcommittee I am on is the 'Problematic Use & Misuse of Prescription Medications' (see terms of reference attached). You may ask why Kim? Well in 1994, my 18-year-old son suffered critical injuries in a single car accident. As a result of his injuries, and subsequent operations he became addicted to pain killers & other medications of all different sorts & varieties including Benzos & opiates. You may well be aware of the trauma on families trying to assist, live with, and save a loved one who is on huge amounts of the above. Simon was on a rollercoaster for 16 years, many times he went though rehabs and 'got well' however the merry-go-round continued and we found ourselves and our lives had become as unmanageable as Simon's. We sought help from a family support group, Nar Anon, and we found if we were 'tooled up' and implemented strategies & boundaries in our lives we could 'cope'. Tough love became the order of the day and there were times when we felt we pushed Simon too far with our rules however, when we changed and did not enable him, he too changed for the better. 'I remember I once packed his things and asked him to leave home as it was us or his meds. He denied taking anything but his pupils & unloving behaviour told us otherwise. That was the hardest thing I ever had to do but it was worth the risk to help save him. You see Kim, we had already lost a 2 year old daughter in a farm accident in 1980 & an 18 year old son in a motorbike accident in 2004. We were determined to save Sime. In 2008, whilst in yet another rehab, Simon discovered he was the father of a four-year-old girl . He was overjoyed as we were also as we thought this would be the turning point for him. Simon graduated from the rehab in 6 months and decided to come home and work on our farm and also volunteer at the rehab to help others. He lived at home and his little girl lived us for some of the week as well. Simon was an amazing and doting dad, he wanted to stay well for Maddie. We thought the bad times were behind us but the hideous disease of addiction slowly crept back into our lives again. His visits home become less and less and the doctor shopping started again.

"A Mexican search party looking for a frozen body after climbers spotted a frozen skull have stumbled across a second mummified corpse on the country's highest mountain. The original skull had been seen just 1,000 feet (310 metres) from the peak of the 5,610-metre Pico de Orizaba on Monday. But when the 12 local civil protection mountaineers climbed to the top of mountain, which sits a five hour drive from Mexico City and is also known as the Citlaltepetl volcano, they made a second gruesome discovery. Scroll down for video . Discovery: The bodies were found near the peak of Mexico highest mountain Pico de Orizaba . The second body was just 500 feet away (300 metres), and was also frozen and mummified, according to Juan Navarro, mayor of the town of Chalchicomula de Sesma, near the mountain in central Puebla state. Local officials suspect the bodies are two of three Mexicans who went missing after an avalanche 55 years ago on the mountain, which is popular with climbers. However, it hasn't stopped people from Spain and Germany ringing local authorities, in the hope the final resting place of their long-lost relatives may have been discovered. Pieces of clothing found on both bodies could help identify them, Navarro said. However, their identities will not be known until the bodies can be removed from the mountainside. Rescue efforts have so far been hampered by the weather. Tragic: It is thought they may be two Mexicans killed in an avalanche 55 years ago .

"Anna Marczuk-Franczak, pictured after her arrest, has been jailed for wounding a man by stabbing him at a party in Nelson, Lancashire last year . A Polish woman repeatedly jailed for violence in her home country stabbed and nearly killed a man after moving to Britain unimpeded, a court has heard. Anna Marczuk-Franczak, 39, served at least three prison stretches in Poland for a series of attacks dating back to 2002. But after being released from her most recent sentence in eastern Europe, she moved to Britain and attacked a man with a 30-inch kitchen knife in Nelson, Lancashire. A judge in Preston has now jailed Marczuk-Franczak for two years for the stabbing, whose victim suffered a 10cm-deep wound to his chest. The  crown court heard Marczuk-Franczak had invited Piotr Kolodziejski and his girlfriend, Magdalena Swistowksa, to her home in Nelson to celebrate the Feast of St Anna last July. But the celebration quickly sour as Marczuk-Franczak became 'melancholy', complaining that her husband was still in Poland and a current boyfriend was also away, the court heard. After a row broke out, Marczuk-Franczak armed herself with a 30-inch kitchen knife and stabbed Mr Kolodziejski to the chest. The knife thrust 10cm downwards from his neck into his chest cavity narrowly missing his vital organs. Mr Kolodziejski was rushed to hospital and was saved by doctors, being left with a 12-inch scar. Marczuk-Franczak later told police Kolodziejski had started hitting his partner after a few drinks and she had intervened. She claimed that she had only picked up the knife to defend herself but admitted she had been 'waving it around'. She said she later saw blood on the knife but does not know what happened to it. The knife was never recovered. Mr Kolodziejski said in a statement that the attack had a 'significant impact' upon him. He said he struggles to zip up his clothing and shave. He also has problems sleeping and has become 'anxious and stressed, paranoid that someone may lunge at him', the court heard. The court heard that Marczuk-Franczak has served at least three prison sentences for violence in Poland. The court heard Marczuk-Franczak had served three prison sentences for violence in her native Poland . In 2002, she was convicted of theft and causing minor bodily injury and received a one-year prison sentence. The following year she was convicted of causing minor bodily injury and received 18 months in prison and got a further 18 months in May 2004 for the same charge. Marczuk-Franczak was jailed for two years this week after she was found guilty of wounding Mr Kolodziejski. Passing sentence, Judge Andrew Woolman said: 'This incident arose out of a dispute initially between the victim and his girlfriend, he was violent towards his girlfriend. 'I accept that he was violent towards you and he subjected you to a significant attack which caused extensive bruising to your body. I have seen the photos and I sentence you on the basis that it was the victim who caused the injuries to you. 'But the jury's verdict means that you then picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed him in a downward motion to the neck quite deliberately. 'The knife went in some 10 cm down towards the chest cavity. Fortunately for him and for you the knife did not touch any vital organs. 'Nonetheless he is left with a serious wound partly caused by the knife and partly by the surgery and although he started the incident by attacking his girlfriend and you, it is clear that he is still, as a result of what you did to him, has significant problems both with his employment and his general life.' The attack happened after Marczuk-Franczak invited the victim and his girlfriend to her home in Elizabeth, Street, Nelson, Lancashire . The judge added: 'Despite what he has done, you caused that dreadful injury. You are 39 years of age, you have lived in the UK for not too long. 'It's clear that you have something of a turbulent life, you have convictions in Poland for violence - there are not a lot of details but enough so I am able to conclude that you are no stranger to violence in the past when provoked, perhaps. 'Your account in the trial was in affect, that the victim sustained his injuries by accident when you were waving the knife around - an account which the jury rejected. The injury you have caused is so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified.' The Home Office investigates cases of EU citizens who commit crimes in Britain before deciding whether to bring deportation proceedings. Offenders who are given a sentence of  12 months or more are usually recommended for deportation. UK border controls are dependent on other countries sharing information about their citizens' criminal pasts with them, a system which has led to many foreign criminals slipping into Britain, including Arnis Zalkalns, the Latvian killer believed to have murdered west London schoolgirl Alice Gross.","39-year-old served three sentences for violence in Poland from 2002 .

"A German professor has been forced to apologise for declining an Indian student's internship because of the 'rape problem' in his country. Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger's response to the application went viral after it was posted online and prompted a wave of indignation, forcing the intervention of Germany's ambassador to India. Her original response to the student's application stated: 'Dear Sir, unfortunately I don't accept any Indian male students for internships. Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger's email (pictured) stated she didn't accept any male Indian students for internships because of the country's 'rape problem' In response German ambassador to India Michael Steiner wrote a letter (pictured) stating he 'strongly objected' to her comments . 'We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female students in my group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support.' This was later posted online, with the professor's and student's names redacted under the title: 'What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women?' Following the outrage which erupted, she backtracked on her comments, stating in an apology posted to Germany's embassy website that she had 'made a mistake' and apologized to 'everyone whose feelings I have hurt'. When her email came to light, ambassador Michael Steiner wrote a scathing letter rebuking her for the comments, stating: 'Let me make it clear at the outset that I strongly object to this.' He added, in reference to a notorious 2012 Dehli gang rape in which a woman died: 'The Nirbhaya case has triggered a lively, honest, sustained and very healthy public debate - a public debate of a quality that wouldn't be possible in many other countries. Germany's India ambassador Michael Steiner (pictured) condemned the professor's comments in an open letter . 'Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offence to these women and men (activists) ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in India; and it is an offence to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians. 'Let's be clear: India is not a country of rapists.' In the 2012 case he referenced, the student was savagely attacked by six men including with an iron rod after boarding a private bus on her way home from the cinema with a male friend. The woman, who legally cannot be named, died from her injuries 13 days later. The brutality of the assault and her determination to survive so she could report her attackers to police sparked large-scale street protests. Four of her attackers were convicted and given the death penalty in September after the case was fast-tracked, while a juvenile was sentenced to a correctional facility. Another died in jail after apparently committing suicide. The case sparked soul-searching about India's treatment of women and also led to initiatives to educate men about respect and equal gender rights in the deeply patriarchal country.","Professor at Leipzig University sparked outrage when declining application .

"A stingray weighing nearly 800lb has become the  largest freshwater fish ever caught by rod and line. The gigantic flat fish, which was 8ft wide and 14ft long, took nearly two hours to reel in. It was caught by American TV nature conservationist Jeff Corwin on the Mae Klong river in Thailand earlier this week. Scroll down for video . A stingray weighing nearly 800lb is thought to be the largest freshwater fish ever caught by rod and line . It was so big that several men on board a small fishing boat had to take it in turns to help on the rod. After getting the ray alongside the boat it was pulled into a specially-prepared pen where seven people lifted it out of the water so it could be properly measured. Specialists measured its width, length and girth to calculate its weight. The epic catch will be featured on 'Ocean Mysteries with Jeff Corwin', which will be broadcast on ABC in the US later this year. After the catch Mr Corwin tweeted: 'Potential world record freshwater fish, giant stingray, 14ft X 8ft! in Thailand filming for ABC's Ocean Mysteries.' He added: 'According to National Geographic, Fishsiam and Dr Nantarika Chansue, a leading stingray expert, this is likely to be the largest freshwater fish ever caught with a rod and reel. The gigantic flat fish, which was 8ft wide and 14ft long, had to be reeled in by several fishermen for nearly two hours . It could not be placed on scales so specialists measured its width, length and girth to calculate its weight . 'The battle to bring this giant fish to the boat was epic and it took many hours and multiple guys rotating off and on the reel. 'The experience was a true highlight of the series, not only connecting with a record-sized ray but being a part of cutting edge science.' Rick Humphries, of UK company Fishsiam, whose fishing guides helped reel in the ray, said: 'We have caught over 450 different stingrays and our estimations have been proved highly accurate on the rare occasions we have weighed this species. A specially-prepared pen was used to contain the ray while Mr Corwin, fishermen and specialists examined it . It is thought the previous record was held by British angler Ian Welch, who landed a giant stingray weighing between 590lbs and 770lbs in the same river in 2009 .

"It was more closely fought than any chart battle or awards race. But now the three-month planning row between neighbours Jimmy Page and Robbie Williams has ended – with victory for the Led Zeppelin star. Former Take That singer Williams, 41, has abandoned plans to revamp his £17.5million Grade II-listed London property, including excavating a huge two-storey basement. Scroll down for video . Robbie Williams wanted to extend his £17.5m Woodland House (left), which stands next door to rocker Jimmy Page's Grade I listed Tower House (right) But Williams has withdrawn the plans after Page wrote an angry letter to the local council complaining . Veteran guitarist Page, 71, fought fiercely to stop the development going ahead – and these pictures give a glimpse of just why he was so desperate to protect his home. Showing delicate carvings and intricately painted frescoes, the images reveal how carefully Page has maintained the original features of his own Grade I-listed property. The rock star, worth £100million, has closely guarded The Tower House for more than four decades and his restorative works have been labelled ‘exemplary’ by English Heritage. The house is filled with what appear to be beautiful antiques and is rich with detailed paintwork. One imposing fireplace depicts what seems to be a medieval scene, lending the mansion the feel of a castle, in keeping with its austere but impressive exterior. ‘Unblemished’: Jimmy Page was desperate to protect his property, which includes this imposing fireplace below a medieval scene .

He submitted a series of planning proposals seeking permission to redevelop the 46-room home, including building a recording studio and an indoor swimming pool. Page immediately objected, writing a strongly-worded letter to the council warning that ‘the consequences for the building fabric and decorative finish of The Tower House may well be catastrophic’ and hiring a series of architects and engineers to blast the plans. Williams has now withdrawn his application.

"Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot who killed 150 people when he is believed to have deliberately crashed a plane into the Alps, could have killed more if he had realised his dream to fly larger planes for long haul flights. Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the Germanwings A320 Airbus into a rocky ravine of the Alps, locking the pilot out of the cockpit as he put the plane into a descent - killing all 149 people on board and himself. The 27-year-old was said to be a keen glider and an ambitious pilot, with hopes to continue his career by handling larger planes that carried hundreds of passengers. Scroll down for video . Andreas Lubitz was an ambitious pilot who wanted to fly even larger planes, such as a Boeing 747 which carries almost 700 passengers, and could have ended in tragedy for even more people . Fellow pilot Frank Woiton flew with Lubitz three weeks ago and said he was confident with his performance to leave him in charge of the controls. He told German newspaper Bild: 'He talked about his training and how happy he was. He said that he wanted to fly long-haul and become a captain. He had mastered flying and was in control.' Mr Woiton, who comes from Lubitz's home town of Montabaur, said the young pilot had told him he dreamed of flying Boeing 747s and an Airbus A380. Boeing 747 planes are large capacity aircraft, often referred to as a jumbo jet. They have a maximum capacity of 660 passengers. Airbus A380 are also considerably larger than the 180-capacity doomed A320 jet that Lubitz flew. Standard A380 planes carry 544 passengers but larger versions can carry up to 800. Recordings from the one recovered black box have revealed the final moments of the plane, as the pilot desperately tried to get back into the cockpit after being locked out by Lubitz. Lubitz harboured ambitions to fly a 747 jumbo jet (left) - larger than the doomed A320 airbus (right) he flew . A fellow pilot revealed that Lubitz also wanted to fly an A380 airbus - which carries more passengers . Captain Patrick Sondheimer apparently screamed ‘Open the goddamn door!’ as he tried to break down the door and get into the cockpit. His shouts are followed by screams from passengers, according to a transcript published in Bild. Investigators are trying to determine what led Lubitz to deliberately crash the plane, with a torn up sick note for the day of the crash, and medication found at his home suggesting he was suffering with psychological problems. He is also believed to have been struggling with apparent vision problems and was concerned it could affect his dream job as a pilot. Members of the Red Cross and residents living close to the site of the crash paid tribute to those killed . Dozens of flowers have been laid in Vernet, France, to honour the victims of the Germanwings disaster . Lubitz is believed to have sought help with his vision problems as recently as March 10. Police have revealed they found evidence at his home to suggest he suffered from a serious 'psychosomatic illness.' His former girlfriend described him as an erratic and controlling man, who would frequently wake up with nightmares. In a chilling premonition she said he once told her ‘One day I will do something that will change the whole system, and then all will know my name and remember it.’ Lubitz is believed to have been suffering from vision problems and was concerned it would affect his flying . As a child, Lubitz is said to have always wanted to be a pilot and covered his bedroom walls with pictures of planes and collected model aircraft. He is also said to have visited an airfield just 30 miles from the site of the tragic crash with his gliding club as a child. Among the 150 victims of the crash were 16 German children from the same exchange class at school and three Britons - one of which was just seven months old. German officials have announced there will be a ceremony on April 17 in Cologne Cathedral attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and senior officials from other countries including France and Spain.","Andrea Lubitz  deliberately crashed an Airbus A320, killing all passengers .

After placing the girl in a bag, he is seen on surveillance video sneaking her out of Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in January before making it home without being caught (above Bristol before he attempts to flee through the fire exit) In the footage, Bristol is seen carrying the bag, the size of diaper bag, containing his daughter who was covered in blankets before attempting to flee through a fire exit (above his first attempt to leave through the locked door) After pushing the door, which does not open, as he simultaneously causes the hospital to enter lockdown after the device on the child's arm prompts alarms to go off. Next a hospital staff member is seen walking down the hallway and swipes a key card, which turns off the alarm, before having a conversation with Bristol (above) He pushes the door, which does not open, as he simultaneously causes the hospital to enter lockdown after the device on the child's arm prompts alarms to go off. Next a hospital staff member is seen walking down the hallway and swipes a key card, which turns off the alarm, before having a conversation with Bristol, according to KFOR. She tells him to leave through the main exit and not the fire exit. He walks back down the hallway before returning to the first door he tried to exit through, and realizes it is unlocked, making his way down stairs to the lobby and fleeing home. After being told to leave through the main exit and not the fire exit, he is seen walking down the hallway before returning to the first door he tried to exit through which is unlocked, and he leaves . Bristol is last seen after he made his way down stairs and into the lobby before going home (above) The staff were not aware that he was carrying a baby inside of the bag. The door budged open Bristol's second push because it automatically unlocks 15 seconds after the first attempt to open it - and he had tried it more than 15 seconds later, a hospital spokesperson told KFOR. At the time of the incident, the parents had not yet been served by the department of child safety, so they did not commit a crime by removing the child from the hospital. Bristol was later arrested and taken into custody where he now faces a child abuse charge, as the child could have suffocated from the blankets (above Banner Thunderbird Medical Center) In the statement released to Daily Mail Online from February, it said Glendale police detectives continued to look into the incident after it occurred and were able to obtain surveillance video from the hospital. In reviewing that video, detectives observed the father removing the child from the hospital in a bag, and based on evidence obtained. The video and the manner of removal and type of item used to remove the child, detectives were able to  arrest the father and charge him with child abuse. When Bristol was arrested, he was also found carrying meth. The case remains under investigation by the Arizona Department of Child Safety.","Jason Matthew Bristol, 33, of Youngtown, Arizona concealed his two-day old daughter in bag to remove her from hospital to avoid welfare workers .

"Five women's lacrosse players at the University of Maryland Baltimore County have been suspended indefinitely after being accused of threatening freshman teammates in text messages. The messages, exchanged using the GroupMe app, included threats to maim and 'kill' their freshmen teammates and 'take down the coaches.' Mackenzie Reese, 19, Alyssa Semones, 21, Amber Kovalick, 19, Meghan Milani, 19, and Brittany Marquess, 20 have been suspended, with no timetable for their return. The suspended University of Maryland Baltimore County students, including Alyssa Semones, right, are accused of threatening freshman teammates in text messages . The Baltimore Post-Examiner received an anonymous email on Friday that contained 16 pages of text screenshots capturing the alleged messages that appeared under the heading 'Sophmores rule.' The messages weren't sent to the freshmen, but exchanged between the senior girls who expressed their hatred for their new teammates. In one text, a player asked if she can just threaten the freshmen and not haze them. That triggered the response from another player, 'Can we just kill them?' To which another replied, 'I'll pitch in.' 'We wanted to make sure you were aware of the extreme situation at UMBC concerning the women's lacrosse team,' the email signed by 'Seeking Justice' said. 'It is an appalling situation of a jealous older group threatening and carrying out threats of harm against the freshman class.' The players, including Meghan Milani, left, and Mackenzie Reese, right, were suspended nearly an hour before last Wednesday's game but were allowed to sit in the bleachers, where they applauded as their freshman teammates were knocked to the ground . There is no timetable for the return of the suspended girls who include Amber Kovalick, left, and Brittany Marquess, right . UMBC athletic director Tim Hall did not discuss specifics of the texts in an interview on Monday, but he said the school has taken steps to protect the team's freshmen. The university did not directly attribute the suspensions to these accusations, saying only that the five players were suspended 'for violation of team rules.' 'The athletic director and other university leaders are following all applicable policies and practices as we work to fully understand the situation and support our student athletes,' the statement said. The players were suspended nearly an hour before their Wednesday game against Drexel but were allowed to sit in the bleachers, where parents said they applauded as their freshman teammates were knocked to the ground. One of the co-head coaches, Tony Giro, refused to attend the Drexel game unless the administration removed the players accused of threatening the freshmen from the team. Co-head coach Amy Appelt coached the players. The players have already missed two games - last Wednesday against Drexel and Saturday against Manhattan. The Retrievers won both games and are 5-3 this season.","Mackenzie Reese, 19, Alyssa Semones, 21, Amber Kovalick, 19, Meghan Milani, 19, and Brittany Marquess, 20 have been suspended indefinitely .

"These women are proving ballet is not just for the young as they attempt to realise their childhood dreams years long after their contemporaries have put their tutus away. The senior ballet team, made up doctors, teachers and even policewomen, have come together in Guiyang, the capital  of south-west China's Guizhou Province, to perform. But it is more than just a hobby: the women, who are up to the age of 60, have impressed so much Chicago Ballet has invited them to visit in June, the People's Daily Online reported. Growing old gracefully: The senior ballet team is made up of 50 women from 40 to 60 years of age . Discovery: Many of the women only discovered a passion for dance when they were a bit older . Impressive: They have done so well, the Chicago Ballet has asked the women to visit the U.S. in June . The 50-strong group, who prefer to be called 'old girls', have been practising their pirouettes at the Mali ballet school after they convinced them to start a class for the over-40s. Cai Hui is typical of the women who make up the 'old girls'. Hui, who, at 60, is among the oldest, discovered her passion for dance late in life, following a career as a policewoman, and has been learning how to jeté and plié for the last seven years. 'Although we are old, we still have chance to realise our childhood dream,' she said. 'We want to make our ballet dream come true, no matter how hard it is.' Skill: Cai Hui (wearing black top) is one of the older women in the class, at the age of 60 .

"If Kim Kardashian has proven anything, it's that big bums are big business. Kim, who was officially crowned 'world's best bottom', sparked a new trend for 'bacials' - that's bottom facials - and caused a 45 per cent increase in bottom enhancing procedures over the last 12 months. And now, one high street store have created a pair of bottom-boosting jeans that promise to give you a derriere to rival the reality TV star. Debenhams has unveiled a £45 pair of bottom-boosting jeans designed by Jasper Conran. MailOnline's Hanna Flint pitted the enhancing jeans, right, against her regular jeans, left . Debenhams has jumped on the derriere enhancing bandwagon by giving customers the chance to enhance that all-important asset with a pair of £45 jeans. The new denims, designed by Jasper Conran, can add up to two extra inches to your derriere and have proved an instant success for the high-street chain. According to the store, the Shape Enhancing Jeans are said to be flying off the shelves, purchased by women looking for a more shapely figure. FEMAIL put the jeans to the test to see if they really can give you a pert posterior a la Kim or whether it's all just a clever gimmick. The new denims, right, can add up to two extra inches to your derriere compared to normal jeans, left, as modelled by 24-year-old Jenny Kershaw . Lucy Herring, 28, tested out her day-to-day jeans, left, against the bottom-boosting pair, right, which have heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve . The secret to the new jeans' success? A clever combination of cheek-enhancing cut, expert tailoring, and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve, promising to turn a shapeless bottom into rear of the year. Control panels at the front also claim to flatten the tummy to emphasise the effect, while the position of the darts in the denim promise to give a flattering hourglass effect. Debenhams also say the jeans give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear. Speaking about the jeans, a spokesperson for Debenhams said: 'Pictures of curvy famous women, from Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj, to Pippa Middleton and Carol Vorderman, have helped women with prominent rears realise they have a gorgeous fashionable asset to emphasise, rather than minimise. 'Of course it is a little more difficult for women with a slimmer, straight up and down silhouette. The only solution used to be an expensive gym membership and weeks of working out, but now buying a pair of shaping jeans can offer a wonderful, instant booty boost.' The jeans promise to give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear, which Bianca London, 25, tested out (left: regular jeans, right: bottom-boosting jeans) According to the store, the Shape Enhancing Jeans boost bottoms thanks to a clever combination of cheek-enhancing cut, expert tailoring, and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve . So what did our testers think? Jenny Kershaw and Bianca London were impressed. Jenny said: 'I can't say I'm now the proud owner of a behind to rival Kim Kardashian but I like the lift that the jeans give. Everything is more defined and pert - and for £45, that's money well spent.' Bianca added: 'The quality was really impressive and much more fitted and comfortable than my regular jeans, I think these would make a good investment piece and staple item in anyone's wardrobe.' Hanna Flint, however, wouldn't waste her money. ‘I actually think my bum looks better in the first pair of jeans!', she said. 'The darker colour and shape seems to give my rear more definition and lift while the other pair seems to flatten it.'","Debenhams now stocking the Jasper Conran Shape Enhancing Jeans .

"Children as young as three are being lashed at a Muslim refugee camp in Chad for not reciting the Koran loud enough. A teenager with a leather whip teaches the holy text to around 30 boys and girls who fled sectarian violence from neighbouring Central African Republic. The cruel tutor whips the children for not being enthusiastic enough, losing attention for just a moment or even making a small mistake. On Wednesday, a small boy too young to speak was struck in the eye by a strike meant for another girl. The class continued to sing as his anguished cries echoed through the room - inspiring a moment of tenderness from the oppressive teacher who tended to the youngster's injury. Punished: A three-year-old boy cries uncontrollably after his religious teacher in a Chadian refugee camp accidentally struck him in the eye - but many of his classmates have been punished intentionally for not reciting the Koran loud enough . Cruelty: The teenage teacher walks among his frightened pupils with a leather whip - punishing the smallest mistake or lack of enthusiasm with brutal lashes . Oppression: Around 30 young girls and boys at this makeshift madrassa - or Islamic school - are fleeing sectarian violence in their native Central African Republic . Exodus: These young children are among 5,000 Chadian refugees occupying Zafaye refugee camp after fleeing their war-torn home country . Whipped: Children like this girl risk a brutal lashing for not paying attention, not reciting the Koran loud enough and even making a small mistake . It has been more than a year since these refugees fled their home country when Christian extremists began killing members of a Muslim militia group that overthrew the government in 2013. Their devout parents are aware of the corporal punishment their kids suffer at the madrassa - or Islamic school - but send them there anyway. The unofficial establishment offers the children some relief from the blistering sun overhead, as others learn more traditionally at the formal school elsewhere in the camp. Officials from UNICEF who maintain a presence in the camp near Chad's capital N'Djamena say they were not aware the school existed. Chad has also become home to thousands of Nigerians who fled attacks by Boko Haram - another extremist Islamic group which has recently pledged allegiance to ISIS. More than 5,000 Muslims of Chadian descent live in the camp built on the site of an unfinished resort complex near 10 miles from its capital. Impoverished: 4-year-old Mariam, who was recently injured by a pot of boiling water, sits outside her tent which is just 10 miles from Chad's capital Zafaye . Cared for: At least one-month-old Hambra Jibril has his mother to hold him before he is bathed, unlike many of the children whose parents still live in CAR . Safe for now: Two three-years-olds are making the best of their time in the Zafaye refugee camp which is at least free of brutal sectarian violence, unlike their native CAR . Hard times: But one place the children are not safe is the unofficial madrassa - or Islamic school - in the camp where a teenager takes lessons and doles out oppressive punishment . Many of them came via a route established between CAR's capital Bangui and N'Djamena and some of their trucks came under attack along the way. 40-year-old Amin Idris said: 'I am a marketing director of an import-export business in Bangui. We have been here for over a year now. I cannot go back until the situation in Bangui is safe.' But it may be a while before it is safe to return, with many Muslims trapped in isolated communities across the impoverished country and threatened by the violence of Christian fighters. CAR comprises around 4.6 million citizens and was plunged into sectarian conflict amid the violent rule of a Muslim rebel coalition that was forced from power by the Christian anti-Balaka fighters. Both sides have committed human rights abuses and severe instability threatens democratic elections due to take place this year, after they were organised by a transitional government. Threatened: Back in CAR, these children made up were among 4.6 million of their countrymen before it was plunged into sectarian conflictbetween a Muslim rebel coalition and Christian anti-Balaka fighters . Ignorant: Officials from UNICEF who maintain presence in the camp where these children play said they were not aware the madrassa in which children are beaten existed . Many of the Chadian refugees in the camp came via a route between CAR's capital Bangui and N'Djamena - and some of their trucks came under attack along the way.","Children at the Islamic school near the Chadian capital of N'djamena fleeing violence from Central African Republic .

"Her arm thrust out and pouting like a rapper, this is the moment that Michelle Obama showed off her dance moves during a toe-curling appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. Challenged to show off her dance moves by Ms Degeneres, Mrs Obama gamely obliged and went on to pull shapes that wouldn't have shamed Rita Ora. Unfortunately for daughters Sasha and Malia, the appearance on Ellen, which airs on the 16th March, isn't the end of the 51-year-old's dancing ambitions. Toe-curling: Michelle Obama does her best Rita Ora during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show . Mrs Obama was appearing on the show to mark the fifth anniversary of her 'Let's Move!' initiative, which aims to encourage people to get out and do some exercise. As part of the campaign, the US First Lady revealed that she - and a party of helpers from So You Think You Can Dance - will be performing a routine to Uptown Funk on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll. This year's event, which will take place on the 6th April, is part of a tradition that dates back to 1878 when President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House gardens to local children. Although egg hunts are no longer part of the event, children are still invited for egg rolling on the lawn and a slap-up afternoon tea. Practising: According to Mrs Obama, she has been practising the dance routine for more than a year . All smiles: Ms DeGeneres, who says her style is 'street', also joined in with the dance routine .

Luckily for the teenagers, Mrs Obama revealed during her chat with Ms DeGeneres that she has been practising for the moment for more than a year, hopefully minimising the potential for embarrassment. Not that the Obamas will be too worried if they are, with President Obama previously telling the Press that should his daughters think of getting a tattoo, he will insist on getting one too. Most recently, the girls couldn't hide their embarrassment during a Thanksgiving event, the pardoning of the turkey, in which Obama 'pardoned' two turkeys named Mac and Cheese. Embarrassing: The Obamas' daughters have had numerous toe-curling moments at their parents' hands . Displeased: Most recently, they looked nonplussed as their father cracked jokes during a White House dinner . Embarrassing dad: President Obama has previously admitted to dancing to Gangnam Style around the house . The press corps laughed along but both Malia and Sasha appeared disinterested as Obama joked: 'Let's face it, if you're a turkey and you're named after a side dish, your chances of escaping Thanksgiving dinner are pretty low!' Like his wife, the US President has also deployed dance as a means of winding up his daughters, having once told People magazine of his penchant for performing to Gangnam Style. 'They're cooler than I am,' he added. 'There are things I like that they think are cheesy, like Gangnam Style. I love that.'","Michelle Obama showed off her dance moves during a TV appearance .

"Every season has one, a big trend or  specific piece of clothing that sends shoppers into a buying frenzy and garments flying off shelves in seconds. There was the pink coat craze of Autumn 2013, the blanket scarf trend of the winter just passed and who can forget the crop top and high-waisted skirt look worn day-in-day-out by celebrities including Kim Kardashian last summer? This season however, Marks & Spencer style director Belinda Earl believes it's her turn, and she might just be right. Scroll down for video . Marks and Spencer is hoping to raise its fashion game with the new Spring/Summer 2015 clothing collection, namely this limited edition real suede skirt, £199, inspired by the seventies trend fashion revival . Meet the suede skirt M&S is pinning all its hopes on for a much-needed fashion revival. Due in stores next month, the £199 skirt has already been given the celebrity seal of approval. In February, both British model Alexa Chung and New York style icon Olivia Palermo wore the skirt within days of each other, the latter at New York Fashion Week no less. After first debuting their hero design at the Spring/Summer 2015 collection preview for the industry's key fashion editors, there's been a buzz surrounding the Seventies-inspired item. British model and It girl Alexa Chung wore the M&S suede skirt to a celebrity-studded launch party in London. Known for her mix of chic and edgy style, Alexa has sparked more than a few fashion trends in her time . New York socialite and fashion blogger Olivia Palermo, who shot to fame on US reality show The City as an apprentice at fashion house Diane von Furstenberg, debuted the M&S suede skirt at New York Fashion Week . Now M&S is hoping the fashion-led fancies of high street shoppers are taken by the skirt in exactly the same way. The brand has even brought the sale date forward by a month from May to April in anticipation of the frenzy, and seen to it that five times the original order of suede skirts are made. Of her fourth collection for the high street giant, and complete revamp of the brand's failing fashion offering, style director Belinda Earl told British Vogue: 'Everything is coming together. Designed to be both on trend and practical, the soon to be famous Marks and Spencer suede skirt will launch in stores and online 10 April, a month earlier than originally planned to meet high shopper demand . 'The quality, the new styles, the ad campaigns - it's all filtering through. It was never going to be a one-season turnaround.' A cheaper faux suede version of the skirt, priced at £39.50 has already sold out online, raising expectations for the hero number even higher. Inspired by the Seventies trend popular on the Spring/Summer 2015 Fashion Week catwalks, the skirt has also been influenced by M&S archive designs. Seventies icons Ali MacGraw and Jane Birkin are also a key influence on this season's M&S collection, with wearable style and practical glamour running through its core. The seventies fashion trend is set to be a big look for spring and summer, with designers including Gucci (pictured), Mulberry, Alice Temperley and more showing off plenty of brown suede at fashion week SS15 .","Can the skirt turn the British brand's falling sales figures around?

"The victim of a road rage shooting in Houston rush-hour traffic has been released after the hospital just a few days after being shot in the head by an angry driver who honked at her. Authorities say church singer Kay Hafford, 28, is home recovering from the gunshot that left bullet fragments in the base of her brain on Friday morning. Meanwhile, police are still hunting for the cold-blooded gunman who pulled up along side of her and fired a shot through her window on Interstate 45 North Freeway. According to officials, the victim, identified as Kay Hafford, was heading south and was trying to get on the freeway when she honked at a passing SUV and had an angry exchange with the driver, who then began taunting her. Scroll down for video . Lucky to be alive: Kay Hafford, 28 (left and right) was shot in the back of the head in a Texas road-rage accident but was able to pull over and call for help . Shot fired: Officials say Hafford got into an angry confrontation with another driver and honked at him, prompting the man to fire on the passenger window of her Dodge Avenger (pictured) She kept her cool: Despite being wounded in the head, Hafford was able to safely pull over and waited 15 minutes for EMS to arrive . A short time later, the unnamed motorist pulled up beside her, aimed a gun at the front passenger window of her red Dodge Avenge and pulled the trigger, reported Click2Houston. Hafford suffered a gunshot wound to the back of the head but was able to pull over and dial 911. It took responding constables about 15 minutes to track down the woman's car and get her medical help, reported KHOU. Paramedics who responded to the scene rushed her to Memorial Hermann Texas Trauma Institute, where she is currently listed in fair condition. The 28-year-old woman is said to have bullet fragments in the bottom right side of her brain. Constables are now searching for the man who fired the shot.

"It is called the 'happiest place on Earth', but not, you may think, for your bank balance. For families whose children are pressuring them to visit the magical theme park in Florida, the expenses can quickly rack up. But there are some tricks of the trade to help enjoy Disney on a budget. From clever packages to websites selling discounted tickets and even the option to camp instead of staying in a hotel, there are plenty of ways to cut costs. Scroll down for video . Stock up on all you may possibly need during your day. You will pay a premium for simple vitals such as sun tan lotion, plasters and water . Camp instead of staying in a hotel . Yes there are plenty of themed hotels at Disney, but you will part with a lot of money for the privilege of staying within the parks. But Disney offers a range of accommodation from castles to campsites, and the latter can be as inexpensive as $43 (£28) per night. Stay at the Disney Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground, in a rented tent, or bring your own for the cheapest price. Complimentary shuttles are available to all the parks, and you can enjoy the campsite's pool, canoeing and archery activities in its 750 acres woodland setting. Experience the happiest place on earth without paying a fortune! Shop around a few months in advance for the best ticket prices, and never buy on the door . Sign up for the Disney Dining Plan . The Disney Dining Plans are offered for UK holidaymakers staying in a Disney resort. They have to be booked in advance, and operate by purchasing a card with allocated meals loaded onto them. The cards can be swiped and deducted when in the parks, at a range of locations. These are useful as you won't be tempted to go over budget, and you can pay in advance before you reach the parks and are tempted to splurge out. Attraction tickets sold online . Do not fall into the trap of buying on the door. Not only will you have to queue for longer to get into the park, you will also miss out on the cheaper ticket prices. Just last month it was reported that single-day ticket prices are expected rise to $105 (£69.57) for the Magic Kingdom and $99 (£65.50) for the three other resort parks - Hollywood Studios, EPCOT and the Animal Kingdom Park. One-day tickets for the Magic Kingdom currently cost $99 before tax and entrance to each of the other parks in the resort costs $94 (£62.28). But there is no need to pay the full entry price. If you do your research you can certainly find sites such as attraction-tickets-direct.co.uk offering deals and combination tickets to make it all cheaper. It is worth noting that children under three get into the park for free, and children over ten are classed as adults. There are military discounts available for those who qualify. Explore the magic: The best place to find out what is in the park is not once you are in. Read about the best attractions, and wait times on your journey to avoid long queues . Shop for packages that include unlimited park access . Virgin is currently doing a deal for a 14-day Disney park ticket for the price of a seven-day ticket.

Every day an average of 210 pairs of sunglasses are turned in and, since 1971, an estimated 1.65 million pairs of glasses have found their way into the 'lost' bin. On an annual basis, Lost and Found cast members collect more than 6,000 cell phones, 3,500 digital cameras, 18,000 hats and 7,500 autograph books. Curious Claims . . . According to long-time Lost and Found staffers, the most unusual items turned in have been a glass eye, a prosthetic leg and a potty trainer. Each, incidentally, was claimed (but not by the same person). Source: Disney . Time management is vital . There are four theme parks at the Walt Disney World Resort, and if you have the time, a full day is advised to experience everything you can there. It is tempting to maximise your freedom and opt for a park hopper ticket, allowing entry into more than one park in a day. Note: These tickets are more expensive, as you are paying for the luxury of park choice. If you have decided to use this, for example those on a limited time schedule, it is key to strategise your day before you arrive. Look on the map and on a Disney wait time app to see which attractions are the most popular and do them first, or last. Easy WDW has dedicated maps for which rides to tackle first. Your park ticket can act as a free fast track ticket for some rides, giving you a time to come back during the day to a faster queue line. Eating during peak lunch hours will slow your day down if you are queuing in the restaurants, bring your own lunch for a cheaper, and quicker pit stop. Don't go during the summer . The summer holidays are the peak time to go to Disney, meaning higher prices and longer queue times. Early summer is when the parks are busiest so consider going in the late summer months or in winter to take advantage of cheaper tickets. Early September is a good time to visit as the temperatures are lower, and most schools will be back after the holidays. Use Disney Dining Cards to help budget for the trip. These must be bought in advance, but help to limit what you spend in the parks . Arrive at park opening to get all the hours you pay for. Not only will temperatures and queues be lower, you will maximise what you can see during your day . Plan ahead and bring supplies . The parks are set up to cater to your every need, but there is a hefty price attached to basic items. Eliminate extra costs by bringing everything you require to the parks, so you aren't forced to fork out on essentials like toiletries, sunscreen, plasters, and snacks. Get there earlyYou are paying for every hour the park is open, so maximise your time in the park, especially when the queues and temperatures are low. Tasty treats: At every corner in Disney is a new snack for guests during their stay. Bring your own snacks to avoid splurging out, on top of your ticket price . Pushchairs . If you are planning on hiring a pushchair when you are there, it can be extremely expensive if you are there for an extended stay. Be prepared to pay about $15 (£10) per day at the parks, and it could be worth buying a cheap one from Walmart for $20 (£13) for your holiday. Souvenir refill drinks . Instead of forking out for a number of drinks, either bring your own bottles and refill at the water stations, or invest in a souvenir refill mug. These cost around $15 (£10) and entitle you to free refills for your holiday. If you don't mind sharing, why not invest in one for your group and split the cost, and all reap the free rewards during your stay. Some hotels offer extra hours for their guests, it could be worth paying for these hotels instead of paying for another day's ticket to see all the attractions . Bring your own food . Dining at Disney is designed to accommodate a range of budgets, but a cheeseburger, chips and a drink will still cost about £10. Bring snacks to last the day and maximise your time in the park. Don't fall into the souvenir trap . It is so tempting to want to buy every item with mickey mouse's face on it, but before you splurge on expensive goods, realise that it is not the only place to buy disney presents and goods. If you have eager children, The Southern Plate suggests stocking up on small merchandise from cheaper shops before you go, and producing them during the trip so they won't be tempted to want every product in the shops. A lot of children want to get their favourite character's autographs, so make sure you come armed with one before you go. Merchandise is available at cheaper shops, and presents and treats can be bought before you go to keep costs low . Remember you will pay for parking . You will start forking out before you set foot in the park, so be aware of this, and factor it into your budget. Many of the nearby hotels offer free shuttles to the park. but if you are staying further out, driving there will be your only option. Currently automobiles, taxis, limos and motorcycles currently cost $17 (approx £11) a day to park, with campers and and RV costing a dollar more. What is good to know is once you've paid this at one of the parks, you do not have to pay again at the other disney theme parks that day. If you know people in the area, a free lift to the drop off zone is the best option to avoid paying. Most importantly, relax and enjoy your trip. If you plan in advance you can have a great day and not break the bank at the same time .","A holiday to Disney can appear out of reach for some families on a budget .

"Movie theaters in Idaho have reportedly been banned from serving alcohol during showings of the erotic R-rated blockbuster Fifty Shades of Grey. According to the Idaho Statesman, state law prohibits the sale of booze when it comes to 'sexually explicit films.' Apparently at least two theaters have been ordered to comply with the restrictions - leaving many moviegoers up in arms. Movie theaters in Idaho have reportedly been banned from serving alcohol during showings of the erotic R-rated blockbuster Fifty Shades of Grey (stock image above) Indeed, Michele Williams, 50, of Eagle told the newspaper: 'I just found it odd that this movie was singled out. 'I just thought, ""What year am I living in here? Women can't control themselves when they drink during this movie?"" I don't know what the message was.' Meanwhile, Michael Deeds who reported the ban for the Idaho Statesman, said it's just another example of 'nonsensical' regulation. 'Here's an equally polite if totally exasperated message right back at state lawmakers: Idaho's prudish, remarkably bad alcohol statute needs to be tied up, blindfolded and dominated by someone with a brain,' he wrote. Explicit content: According to the Idaho Statesman , state law prohibits the sale of booze when it comes to 'sexually explicit films' Dave Corkill, a theater owner in Idaho, agrees that the law is flawed. He noted that some PG-13 films seemingly violate the statute as it calls out actions such as 'hugging' and 'caressing another person in the wrong manner.' Corkill hopes by highlighting the issue lawmakers will change the Idaho Code 23-614. He adds that for many customers sitting down in front of a movie with a bottle of wine is 'part of the experience.'","State law prohibits booze when it comes to 'sexually explicit films'

"An investigation has been launched into an incident where one student was pinned down by one of his classmates while a third rubbed his genitals around the first boy's face. The incident unfolded on The Scots College's Glengarry campus in Kangaroo Valley - almost 160 kilometres south of Sydney in New South Wales - last month,The Sydney Morning Herald reported. NSW Police have confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they were looking into the matter. The Scots College's Glengarry Campus in the Kangaroo Valley south of Sydney was the scene of the alleged incident . 'Detectives from the NSW Police Force are making inquiries into an incident which is alleged to have occurred at an educational campus in Kangaroo Valley,' a spokesman said. 'For investigative reasons, no other information can be provided at this time.' While the college's principal Ian Lambert did not reveal specifics, he said there had been incident and the parents of the students at the centre of it had been alerted. 'The College immediately implemented our procedures, which included reporting to the NSW Police and speaking with the parents of the boys involved in the incident,' Dr Lambert told Fairfax Media. 'Other agencies were informed and kept updated during the investigation.' It is understood by Fairfax Media the two boys who initiated the incident were still enrolled at the school. It is understood by Fairfax Media the two boys who initiated the incident were still enrolled at the school . They have since come back to the Bellevue Hill campus in Sydney's east. A parent at the school said bullying was 'particularly rife' at the Kangaroo Valley campus, saying it was 'accepted as an ""old boys"" rite of passage'. But this is not the first controversy involving The Scots College. The school was ordered to pay almost $500,000 to Nathan Chaina's family last year. Nathan drowned on a school excursion at Glengarry in 1999. It took 12 years for his family to finally get the Supreme Court to rule in their favour, but the Chainas were later told they had to pay for the school's $8 million legal bill. The Scots College made headlines last year when the family of Nathan Chaina, who drowned while on a school trip at its Glengarry campus, were paid compensation over his death . The two residential terms at Glengarry by Year 9 students are meant to be 'a rite of passage into manhood' where 'boys learn the tools they need to grow into fine young men', according The Scots College website. The news of last month's incident comes as Boarding Australia and the Australian Boarding Schools Association - which represent institutions - look to review protocol following revelations during the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse involving Knox Grammar School. It has been revealed headmasters at the helm of Knox over the years have kept silent over sexual abuse cases, which were happening under their watch. Daily Mail Australia has contacted The Scots College for a response.","Incident happened last month on the Glengarry campus in Kangaroo Valley .

"If you're of the opinion that text speak and emojis are making us lazy and ruining language, you may want to look away now. A developer has created the ultimate predictive text app called Lazyboard that provides a list of just ten commonly used words, and 11 emoticons. Users can combine these prepopulated words to create messages quickly and simply without having to type a single letter. Lazyboard was created by Reddit user Sir-Zeph and it lets people communicate using a list of just ten commonly used words (pictured) including 'cool', 'nice', 'damn', 'oh', 'thks' 'lol' and 'lel' The free app is available for phones running Android 4.2 and above, and words include 'cool', 'nice', 'damn', 'oh', 'thks' 'lol' and 'lel'. Lazyboard was uploaded to the Google Play Store by developer Prem Adithya, listed as Reddit user Sir-Zeph. Its description says: 'Feeling lazy? Not in the mood for a proper conversation? Well the only thing you need is the lazyboard. 'It is a minimalistic keyboard that has the important keys required to have a lazy conversation.' The Lazyboard comes with two themes - dark and light - that can be configured in the app Settings menu, and Sir-Zeph wrote on Reddit that a pro version is 'coming soon' that will have more themes.

It is the latest in a long line of apps and products designed to tap into the growing trend of people replacing conversations with acronyms, emojis and shortcuts. Last month, for example, developers  created a keyboard cover that turns every key of a Mac board into an emoji. Once installed, the Caps Lock key lets users switch between regular and emoji keys meaning people can easily add images to Facebook posts, tweets and even official documents. The Emoji Keyboard and its custom software were developed by a team of designers at California-based Disk Cactus.

Each of the covers are made of silicone and act like standard covers to block out dust and dirt. They come in two sizes - one for standard Macs, which includes the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air 13 and the Apple Wireless Mac keyboard (pictured), and one for the 11-inch MacBook Air . The team has set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of at least 1,000 covers, but hopes to be able to mass produce them by the end of the year. And last year a pair of London-based developers created the Emojli app that only let users communicate using the popular miniature images. Even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons. And with the release of iOS 8 Apple allowed app developers to create emoji-based keyboards for iPhones, iPads and iPhones. A study in April last year found that the top trending word, at that time, was emoji. There are now apps dedicated  to the small images. Emojli, for example, (pictured) only lets users communicate using the popular pictures, and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons .

"A former guard at Rikers Island who was convicted of smuggling drugs into the prison has revealed he helped female colleagues prostitute themselves to inmates and senior bosses. Ex-marine turned corrections officer Gary Heyward has made the explosive claims in his controversial memoir about his time as an employee at the notorious New York facility. The Bronx native describes how he would have a list of demands and orders when he arrived at work every day, but the illicit scheme earned him more money than his annual salary which started at $28,000. It included smuggling tobacco, drugs and cellphones to inmates and offering protection to three female prison guards who were selling sex. In the book he describes them as 'copstitutes'. Corruption officer: Gary Heyward, a former guard at Rikers Island, helped female officers prostitute themselves to inmates and jail bosses and later served time for running a huge smuggling operation at the prison . Before he got a job at the jail in 1996, he had served in Operation Desert Storm. His smuggling operation began when he saw a childhood friend, Biz, locked up on Rikers Island. He asked Heyward to pick up a carton of cigarettes which contained marijuana. According to the book titled Corruption Officer, an advanced copy of which was seen by the New York Daily News, the cigarette operation then skyrocketed. He would strap bags of tobacco to his body underneath his uniform to work and would sell $2 worth for around $200. For $500 he would also deliver burner phones to an inmate and would set higher prices for more specific orders - such as liquor, coke, cooch and, in one instance, red velvet cupcakes. However he changed the direction of his venture when a competitor started selling cocaine. He picked up half an ounce of the substance from the sister of his prison distributor, he describes in the book as Flocko, who then managed to make $1,500 in just 15 minutes. As the business grew a female correction officer, identified as Officer Rains, came to him and said she pouches for him if he  protected a the ring of three women who were prostituting themselves to inmates and other correction officers in return. Convicted: The corrections officer (pictured left in his uniform and right in a jumpsuit to promote his book) was jailed for two years in 2006 for selling drugs to inmates . Money: Heyward started working at the New York facility in 1996, starting on a basic annual salary of $28,000. In his book he describes how his illicit scheme made him more money . Rains then discovered Heyward's business had become widely known while she was sleeping with a high ranking security official in a hotel. He said to her during the encounter: 'If you want to get rid of all the drugs in the jail, get rid of Heyward.' His colleagues also started to notice he was friendly with some of the inmates - who they described as losers. Eventually he was busted during an undercover operation. Authorities installed recording devices in Flocko's sister's van and captured one of his drug deals. Heyward was sentenced  to two years in prison in 2006 after admitting to attempting to sell cocaine to an inmate and providing another with a cell phone for $500. In the book he says his behavior was driven by his need for money - as he had outstanding child support and a gambling problem. He wrote the book while behind bars in the upstate facility Oneida. Speaking to the Daily News, he said: 'I’m proof that once you serve your time you can go straight again. I live a respectable life now.' Corruption Officer is due for release on March 31 .

"A five-month-old baby boy who was found with a cord around his neck has died in hospital three days after being found at his family home awhere his mother allegedly killed his two older siblings. Jessica McCarty's five-month-old son Christopher Swist had been on life support at Florida Hospital for Children since Friday, the same day her other children, seven-year-old Laci and six-year-old Philip, were pronounced dead. The 33-year-old mother has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. Scroll down for video . Sole survivor: Police said Monday five-month-old Christopher Swist (right), died  three days after his mother Jessica McCarty killed his two older siblings in a botched murder-suicide. McCarty (pictured on the left in a suicide-protection vest with bandages on her slashed wrists) survived the attack and was arrested . What happened to the happy family? McCarty, pictured with her partner Chris Swist, daughter Laci McCarty (right) and sons Philip McCarty (center) and Christopher Swist (in her arms), called the police on herself . Police say none of the three murdered children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were discovered . The attempted murder charge could be upgraded. Christopher's father came home and found him with a cord wrapped around his neck on Friday at the house in Palm Bay, Florida. McCarty's two other children with another father - Laci and Philip - were found unresponsive in the same room at the home and were pronounced dead that night. The mother strangled the infant and drowned and strangled the daughter, Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said, according to Florida Today. Police say none of the three children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were found. Letter left behind: Investigators say McCarty left a note behind at the scene saying she was 'sorry for what she had to do'. The motive for the attempted murder-suicide is still not clear . On Sunday, McCarty waived her right to appear at her first hearing, sending her attorney instead. In a mugshot provided by the local jail, the troubled mother appears in a suicide-prevention vest with bandages covering her recently-slashed wrists - her mouth agape. Investigators have since revealed that McCarty left a note at the scene addressed 'to my family' in which she says she is 'sorry for what she had to do'. The note included a special address to her young baby's father, asking him to 'keep Christopher's name alive'. The motive for the tragic attempted murder-suicide has still not been revealed. However, McCarty did have a troubled history and in 2009 was investigated by the Department of Children and Families for possible child neglect. The agency recommended McCarty to mental health counseling after that investigation, according to public records. She has also been arrested on charges of forgery, shoplifting, and prescription drug abuse. Police were first called to the family's residence just before 6pm, when McCarty called 911 to say her three children were dead and that she had cut her wrists. Christopher Swist, the father of the infant, also called police when he came home to find the children unconscious in a bedroom. Phillip McCarty (left) was the father of the two older children Jessica is believed to have killed on Friday night . Seven-year-old Laci (right) and six-year-old Philip (left) were pronounced dead shortly after they were found . Disturbing find: McCarty's partner Christopher Swist came home on Friday to find his son (pictured together above) and McCarty's two other children unconscious. The older McCarty children were pronounced dead on Friday. The infant was found with a cord wrapped around his neck and spent the weekend on life support . McCarty allegedly sent pictures of blood inside the home to Swist, leading him to come home and investigate. When he came home, he found his son with a cord wrapped around his neck and lying on a bed. Philip unresponsive in a corner and Laci unresponsive and wounded on a bed. A autopsy on the two McCarty children was scheduled for Sunday. Palm Bay police apprehended McCarty outside her home shortly after she called 911. Officers said they had to shoot her with beanbag rounds because she was 'uncooperative' and was armed with a butcher's knife. Jessica McCarty had her two older children with Phillip (left) before having a third with Chris Swist . Jailed: McCarty, pictured left with partner Chris Swist and her two eldest children Laci and Philip and right again with Chris Swist. She was treated for her injuries and then booked in jail where she is being held without bond . McCarty was in the front yard when apprehended, but she 'wasn't showing her hand' after several requests to do so. She then showed she was holding a knife and refused to put it down, police said. After refusing several requests to put down the knife, police said officers shot McCarty with five to six less-lethal 'beanbag' rounds, which are meant to subdue a person. McCarty was treated for her injuries and taken into custody, according to WFTV. The tragic incident has shaken the community and a prayer vigil for the three murdered children was scheduled for 8pm on Monday night. Following news of little Christopher's death, friends of his father started an outpouring of support on Facebook. According to his profile, Christopher Swist is a former Marine.","Police confirmed baby Christopher Swist, who was on life support, died .

"The partner of Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas today won her High Court battle with her ex-husband over the alleged cut price sale of their luxury London home to the footballer. Property tycoon Elie Taktouk claimed the £5.5million sale of the family home in central London to a company owned by Fabregas was at least £2million under value and sued his ex-wife Daniella Semaan for compensation. But Deputy Judge Richard Snowden QC said such a claim 'has no real prospect of success' and dismissed it. He said the claim 'is yet another court battle between Mr Taktouk and Ms Semaan arising out of the breakdown of their marriage in 2011 which led to their acrimonious divorce in 2013.' Cesc Fabregas's girlfriend, Daniella Semaan (left with Chelsea player), has won a High Court battle with her ex-husband, Elie Taktouk (right) after she sold her former marital home to the footballer . The judge said Mr Tartouk still owed Ms Semaan nearly £1million of a lump sum in a divorce order and legal costs of more than £500,000. Ms Semaan, 39, is currently pregnant with Fabregas's  second daughter. They already have toddler, Lia, born in 2013. In January last year, Family Division judge Mr Justice Coleridge gave the go-ahead for the sale of the former family home in Belgravia to a Spanish firm Zirrintza owned by Mr Fabregas. In a preceding hearing, Mr Taktouk had claimed the property was being sold at 'significant undervalue', claiming it was worth up to £10million and at least £7million. But in allowing the sale, the judge said Mr Taktouk 'has a history of lacking credibility'. Deputy Judge Snowden said he had failed in a bid to appeal a previous ruling and had now launched these new proceedings. But he still owed his Lebanese born ex-wife almost £1million ordered to be paid as part of a £1.4million lump sum in divorce proceedings, the court heard. Ms Semaan originally hooked up with Fabregas in Spain when he played with Barcelona and she took her two children, aged 14 and 10, by Mr Taktouk with her. A row centred on a property in this London street, where Ms Semaan and Mr Tartouk used to live . Ms Semaan flew to Spain to be with Fabregas when he played for Barcelona. They have since had a daughter . They returned to London last summer after the player's £27million move  to Chelsea. In a previous case, Mr Justice Coleridge ordered the sale of the Grade II listed flat in April 2013 when Mr Taktouk was ordered to pay his ex wife £1.4million to buy a new home. He claimed that if Mr Fabregas bought the former home she would end up staying there and have £1.4million in the bank. He also claimed a higher price was achievable. Also in April 2013, Mr Taktouk lost his bid to appeal against the financial settlement when he claimed that Fabregas would be keeping her in the future. The judge said Taktouk was financed by his wealthy father. Since then Mr Taktouk and his father undertook to pay a total of £680,000 owing in legal costs in a series of lump sum payments. The court heard £250,000 had been paid, but the balance with additional costs taking it over £500,000 are still to be paid. In dismissing his claim the judge said Mr Taktouk was seeking to argue the same points which had already been ruled on. Mr Taktouk and Ms Semaan married 15 years ago when they were both 24 and living in Lebanon. A company owned by Fabregas, who moved back to London to play for Chelsea last year, bought the house .","Daniella Semaan left Elie Taktouk for Fabregas when he was in Spain .

The Howard Medical School graduate (mughshot pictured left) and his wife Jennifer Martin (mugshot right) hosted the sex-fuelled parties at their Las Vegas home. It was raided in September and police found drugs . His illicit parties were foiled by an undercover operation which began when police created a covert adult website. In late 2013, they were then invited to a 'Frost and Furs' party at the home Martin shared with spouse, who is also known as Jennifer Lynn Taylor. The property is estimated to be worth more than $3million. They had some knowledge of the level of narcotics that were being distributed at the events, but police said they group had been 'difficult to infiltrate'. Undercover cops posing as a couple dressed up and attended the event. According to the Las Vegas Review Journal officer Cynthia Hurtado, one of the undercover officers told a grand jury: 'It was a swingers lifestyle party, which means people, couples had intercourse with each other.' The pair were forced to leave when the party started getting physical, but one was offered Molly, a colloquial term for MDMA, by a reveller before they departed. Hurtado added: 'It lowers your inhibitions, so that’s why people take them. They want to get sexual and stuff like that.' According to police, Martin, who was referred to as Scotty by attendees, subsequently invited the pair to another party at the Trump Hotel in January 2014. The married couple were arrested at their $3million home in September when police swarmed their house as guests showed up to an adult party . Jaymie Lenz (left) and Robert Ruffin (right) were arrested and charged with drug possession. According to police Ruffin laid down four lines of cocaine at a party and offered the officers a try . He whispered them a password: Fidelio - the title of a Ludwig van Beethoven opera also known as Leonore, or The Triumph of Married Love. The theme of the night was Eyes Wide Shut - based on the 1999 film starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a married couple who go on a night of 'sexual discovery'. He offered more MDMA to the pair when they arrived at the door, police claim. Hurtado told him she needed something to loosen up. The doctor then told her: 'I will get you loose once I have sex with you later.' At a 'Neon Kitties' party in April, police brought another undercover female officer to join as many as 100 people in the venue. Robert Ruffin, Jaymie Lenz and Jovan Sanita Smith, attended the event that featured florescent body paint for the black lights. Ruffin allegedly laid out four lines of cocaine on the kitchen counter, and he, Jaymie Lenz and Jovan Sanita Smith each snorted a line. When Ruffin left, another undercover officer, Noel Roberts, scooped what was left of the substance into an evidence bag, the Review Journal reported. R . Ruffin is now facing four charges - including being under the influence and possession of a controlled substance. Martin met the undercover police pair again at the Book & Stage sports bar at the five-star Cosmopolitan hotel and invited them to another sex-fuelled party in September. Christopher Sbraccia (mugshot left) is facing drug charges after police found meth in his Las Vegas home and Jovan Sanita Smith (mugshot right) has admitted possession of a controlled substance . Hurtado told the jury: 'He said that it's basically good-looking people that have sexual intercourse with each other and that everybody is very friendly.' Before guests could arrive, officers swarmed his house and arrested him. During a search more than half an ounce of marijuana was found behind the DJ booth. They also discovered magic mushrooms, meth­amphetamine, cocaine and MDMA at the address. The doctors wife pleaded guilty earlier this month to a single charge of possession of drugs which and paid a $1,000 fine. Lenz and Jovan Sanita Smith, did the same. In October, police executed a search warrant at the home of Shannon Grammer, also known as Shannon Gale Dutcher, who had offered police MDMA at the 'Neon Kitties' party. They found a handgun registered to her alongside a pistol and a 12-gauge shotgun that were claimed by a friend. Lenz (mughsot left) pleaded guilty to possession of drugs and paid a $1,000 fine. Ruffin is facing four drug charges including possession . Grammer told police she had been addicted to meth for 10 years. She was charged with three counts of trafficking, two counts of possession and three counts of ownership or possession of a firearm by a prohibited person as a result of a previous drug arrest. Christopher Sbraccia, who was at the house at the same time, faces the same charges. Martin was suspended from practicing medicine for two months after his arrest. He was told he must follow stringent guidelines for two years if he wants to continue working as a doctor. He went into an in-patient treatment program at the Betty Ford Center in California and was released in November, the Review Journal reported. In 2005 he opened ASM Ortho and describes himself as a surgeon who 'specializes in minimally invasive joint reconstruction and arthroscopic treatment of sports related injuries,' on his website. However he is still awaiting trial on the drug charges. Jennifer Coppola, another woman who attended the parties, was arrested and charged with two counts of the sale of a controlled substance.

"Repeated use of some types of antibiotic may raise the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, warn researchers. Findings from a new US study underline the need to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, it is claimed. More than 3 million Britons are diagnosed with diabetes and nine out of ten have type 2 which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar. Researchers  looked at the number of antibiotic prescriptions given to 200,000 diabetics a year before they were diagnosed, and found those given at least two courses had a higher chance of getting the condition . Type 2 is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet. Researchers from the Departments of Gastroenterology and Medical Oncology at the University of Pennsylvania carried out the investigation. They looked at the number of antibiotic prescriptions given to more than 200,000 diabetics in the UK at least one year before they were diagnosed with the disease, and compared this to the number given to 800,000 non-diabetic patients of the same age and sex. They found that patients prescribed at least two courses of penicillins, cephalosporines, quinolones and macrolides were at higher risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The risk increased with the number of antibiotic courses prescribed, says a report in the European Journal of Endocrinology (must credit). More than 3million Britons have diabetes and nine out of ten have type 2 which occurs when the body loses the ability to process blood sugar . Patients prescribed 2-5 courses of penicillins – used for a variety of infections - increased their risk of diabetes by 8 per cent. The risk increased by 23 per cent for those having more than five courses of penicillins. Patients having 2-5 courses of quinolones, used in respiratory and urinary tract infections, had an increased diabetes risk of 15 per cent, which rose 37 per cent for those having more than five courses. The risk was calculated after adjusting for other risk factors such as obesity, smoking history, heart disease and history of infections. Study leader Dr Ben Boursi said ‘Gut bacteria have been suggested to influence the mechanisms behind obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes in both animal and human models. ‘Previous studies have shown that antibiotics can alter the digestive ecosystem.’ senior author Dr Yu-Xiao Yang added: ‘While our study does not show cause and effect, we think changing levels and diversity of gut bacteria could explain the link between antibiotics and diabetes risk.’ There was no increase in risk associated with use of antivirals or anti-fungal medications and the study found little evidence of a link between antibiotic use and the risk of type 1 diabetes. Dr Boursi said ‘Over-prescription of antibiotics is already a problem around the world as bacteria become increasingly resistant to their effects. ‘Our findings are important, not only for understanding how diabetes may develop, but as a warning to reduce unnecessary antibiotic treatments that might do more harm than good.’ Prof Jodi Lindsay, Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis, St George’s, University of London, said ‘Patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing infections, and therefore they are more likely to be prescribed antibiotics to treat those infections. ‘In the year prior to diabetes diagnosis, patients may show some signs of disease and may also have a higher risk of infection, and therefore receive more antibiotics. ‘This is a very large and helpful study linking diabetes with antibiotic consumption in the UK public, but at this stage we don’t know which is the chicken and which is the egg. ‘The idea that antibiotics might contribute to diabetes development might be important and more research needs to be done.’","Researchers probed antibiotic prescriptions to 200,000 diabetes sufferers .

"A blind man has been investigated for benefit fraud after he scored a 180 in a charity darts event and was deemed to be too good to be blind. Visually impaired Robert Boon, 50, from Paignton, Devon was stunned to discover a member of the public had reported him to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) - claiming someone that good at darts could not possibly be blind. 'Everything went OK. Then I got a letter from the DWP,' he explained. Scroll down for video . Visually impaired Robert Boon, 50, (pictured) from Paignton, Devon organised a ten-hour darts marathon to raise funds for the £10,000 training of two guide dogs . Mr Boon felt moved to raise the money for charity in memory of his recently deceased friends. A user of a guide dog himself, he knew how important they could be for individuals with impaired sight . Mr. Boon, who is registered blind as he is completely blind in one eye and only able to see shadows in the other, said: 'I rang them up because I couldn't read it, and they explained to me that someone had reported me because of the dart marathon. 'There were loads of people there, so it could have been someone at the event. 'I felt humiliated because I don't think it is right to report me when I have tried to do something good. 'I rang the hospital to get my medical records on my eye condition. I don't see why people should put me down. 'I feel really intimidated now. I am registered blind and can't see virtually anything out of one eye and shadows in the other. The DWP have confirmed that after an investigation it does not intent to cut Robert's benefits. Mr. Boom organised a ten-hour darts marathon to raise funds for the £10,000 training of two guide dogs who he wanted to name Mary and Wesley after his recently deceased friends. Mr Boom explained that due to the repetitive action of dart throwing he was able to maintain some accuracy . He scored 61,000 points and a maximum 180 with three darts. He played the game when he was younger . Having played darts for fun before he lost his sight, Robert decided the event was the best way to raise the cash. Throughout the day held at the Pond Coffee Shop in Paignton, Robert racked up 61,000 points and at one point a maximum 180 with three darts. Mr Boom explained that due to the repetitive action of dart throwing he was able to maintain some degree of accuracy. Mr. Boon stood his ground with the DWP but said he felt humiliated and intimidated by being accused of fraud . Mr. Boon felt the whole episode was unfair, especially considering he was trying to help people like him . He stepped up to the oche at 10am, and was throwing darts all day, with a five minute rest every hour, until nearly 9pm. Robert said: 'I've always had bad eyesight, I was never allowed to drive or even play football. The only sports I was allowed to do was judo or darts. 'Two of my friends passed away recently and I wanted to name guide dogs after them, so that their names could live on. 'I was watching TV a while back and saw a blind darts team, so I decided to give it a go. 'I knew the layout of the board, when you've been playing for ten hours straight you start to get a gauge for where things are on the board. The DWP have confirmed that after an investigation it does not intent to cut Robert's benefits . A spokesman for the Deparment for Work and Pensions said: 'It's only right that we investigate a person's benefit claim when we receive information that suggests they may not be entitled.' Mr Boon worked in the hotel business until he was diagnosed blind three years ago. He is married to his wife Donna, 52. and has one child by a previous relationship, Lauren, 11. He has said he will continue in his efforts to raise money for guide dog training, despite recent events. However, Robert said he had questioned whether he should go on after he received the letter from the DWP, theTorquay Herald Express reported. Because of the impact of the day and the support he received, Mr. Boon decided to continue supporting his cause. 'I have a guide dog myself and I wanted to show people how important the guide dogs can be,' he said when first organising the event.","Robert Boon, 50, from Devon scored the 180 raising money for the blind .

"These music acts are so underground...they don't even exist. Talk show host and prankster Jimmy Kimmel fooled SXSW attendees for the second year in a row, by asking for their opinions on fake bands. A television crew at the Austin, Texas, festival spoke with people in man-on-the-street interviews. Those interviewed seemed unaware it was for Kimmel's 'Lie Witness News,' which catches people fibbing. All but one claimed to be familiar with the musical artists discussed, despite the fact none of them are real,  apparently in an attempt to be cool. Scroll down for video . Liars: At SXSW, the woman on the left claimed to like the group 'Mary Kate and Nasty,' while the man on the left said he was a fan of 'DJ Underwire.' Both musical acts, however, do not exist . In the clip, a female voice off-camera asks a woman in a scarf for her opinion on 'Mary Kate and Nasty,' in a twist on the names of Olsen twins Ashley and Mary Kate. 'I do love Mary Kate and Nasty,' the woman says. 'I really, really do.' 'I just like female singers generally, so I just their kind of - punky, poppy sound,' she says. A male attendee in a button-down offers a full explanation on his love for 'DJ Underwire.' 'Yeah, DJ Underwire is great,' the man says. 'He's really mixing it up with actually turntable-ism and bringing that back in, scratching, right? So it's something that is oftentimes lost on some of the newer-age DJs, and I think it's great how he's bringing that back in.' Another man at SXSW says he's a  'DJ Gluten' fan - though the interviewer says some find him 'hard to take.' 'I like it,' the man says. 'I listen - I have some of it on my phone, actually. I like some of it.' Pretending: The man on the left said he was a fan of 'DJ Cialis' - like the erectile dysfunction medication - and the man on the right said he was a fan of 'DJ Gluten' The video shows one man with a full beard and hat describing the group 'Eddie and His Manpurse.' 'Um, well, Manpurse, is, that's the band, and Eddie is the lead singer, so, you pretty much get to see the whole manpurse. Like, you get to see the whole band,' he explains. A man in glasses lies that he's familiar with 'DJ Cialis' - named for the erectile dysfunction medication. 'Yeah dude, he's got the beat,' the man says. 'He rolls it.' Jokingly referring to the drug's potential harm, the interviewer asks 'Is DJ Cialis a little dangerous if he lasts more than four hours at one of his sets?' 'Dangerous? Really?' the man says, puzzled. He even says he's looking forward to hearing 'Jimmy and the Kimmels.' 'Wait, you said Jimmy and the Kimmels?' he asks. 'Not like Jimmy, like Kimmel, but just like, just like...' 'Like Lie Witness News,' the interviewer says. 'Okay, alright,' he says laughing. 'Why not man, why not?' A woman lies that she knows the band 'Ashley and the Kale Chips' - and fibs she's seen the group in person, but 'only once.' 'I think they're awesome,' she says. 'They have a different sound. You know, it's not like everything so mainstream that you hear all the time.' Interviewed: One woman (left) claimed to be a fan of 'Ashley and the Kale Chips,' while another (right) said she was a fan of 'Cheez Whiz Khalifa' and three other fake artists . A woman in a pink shirt lies that she knows four different music acts. Asked about 'Wiz Khalifa's little brother, Cheese Whiz Khalifa,' the woman says 'Yeah, he has a good sound. I definitely like it. Um, one of my friends is really into him, and so he's more - he's showed me a lot more of him than I've been exposed to.' When quizzed about 'Vlad and the Putins' - a twist on the name of Russian president Vladimir Putin - she answers 'Okay, I have heard of them, I haven't listened to a lot of it.' She even says she is familiar with 'DJ Fictionnel.' 'I actually saw him in France, when I was in Lyon,' she exclaims. The interviewer says at one point 'Do you like the band Jimmy Kimmel Just Made Me Lie for Like 15 Minutes?' 'Yes,' the woman in pink replies, while laughing and putting her hand to her face. A man in a hoodie gives a roundabout reply to a question calling for his opinion on fake music group 'So Much Marijuana.' He says 'I like marijuana. I like a lot of marijuana. So, So Much Marijuana is a good name for a band. I endorse that.' He then goes on to say that marijuana should be legalized in 'all 52 states.'","Talk show host and prankster Jimmy Kimmel fooled SXSW attendees for the second year in a row, by asking for their opinions on fake bands .

"The family of murdered woman Jill Meagher have described a Catholic priest's comments as 'disgusting' and 'stupid' after he told children and parents at a Melbourne primary school that she may not have met such a tragic end had she been 'more faith-filled'. Radio Station 3AW reported that the priest showed the congregation a picture of Adrian Bayley, the man convicted for the Melbourne woman's brutal rape and murder, before claiming that if Ms Meagher's faith had of been stronger she 'would have been home in bed' instead of 'walking down Sydney Road at 3am'. Jill Meagher's husband Tom Meagher described the comments as disgusting and shameful. Scroll down for video . Happier times: Tom and Jill Meagher on their wedding day. Mr Meagher described the recent comments by a Catholic priest about his wife as disgusting and shameful . Mr Meagher also rejected as a 'complete fabrication' reports he or Jill's family planned legal action against the state of Victoria . A priest told a congregation that Jill Meagher (left) may not have been killed by Adrian Bayley (right) if she were 'more faith-filled' as she would have been 'home in bed' and 'not walking down Sydney Road at 3am' 'How a human being with such dangerous and misogynistic views can be allowed to pass those messages onto children is depressing,' he wrote on Facebook. 'What a truly abhorrent message to teach a child.' The Age reports Mr Meagher also rejected as a 'complete fabrication' reports he or Jill's family planned legal action against the state of Victoria, by joining a lawsuit with other relatives of people killed by criminals on parole. Joan Meagher, Jill's mother-in-law, said she was 'shocked' by the priest's 'ridiculous' comments. Greg Bennet apologised on behalf of the preist and said the 'offensive' comments did not reflect the views of the church . 'He's offended a lot of people. This murder has nothing to do with anything - except the guy who killed Jill,' she told the Irish Independent. 'Adrian Bayley was out there that night looking for a victim and found her... It's a stupid thing to say, but I don't care what people like that say.' She said Jill wasn't particularly religious, but was 'very spiritual'. She also said that Jill and her husband Tom had a very strong code of ethics by which they led their life. 'But she wasn't saying the rosary every night,' she told the Irish Independent. 'Even religious people get killed in not-so-nice ways.' At least 100 people, including students, staff and parents, witnessed the comments at St Christopher's Primary School at Airport West on Friday. Monsignor Greg Bennett, vicar-general of the archdiocese of Melbourne, condemned the priest's homily on Friday and said the 'offensive' comments did not represent the views of the church. 'We do not share the sentiment of the homily this morning and we certainly apologise for the hurt that this homily may have caused today,' he told 3AW. 'The reference to Jill Meagher in particular was offensive and inappropriate and the people of Victoria and Ireland mourn her sad and tragic death.' He said he has spoken with the priest who acknowledges that the homily was not appropriate and apologises for the 'upset' and 'offence' it may have caused. Family members have rallied around Mr Meagher after the priest's 'ridiculous' comments . Carolyn Worth, manager of the South Eastern Centre Against Sexual Assault, told Fairfax media that the comments were an 'extreme' form of 'victim blaming'. 'This is about a violent, dangerous man who attacked somebody. It's not about what she was doing,' she said. The revelations come amid comments from Victoria police, spurred by the stabbing murder of Masa Vukotic, warning women to take reasonable precautions when walking in parks at night, and if possible avoid it all together. Dangerous predator: Mr Bayley was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of raping and killing Mrs Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012 . Ms Worth said women 'have a right' to walk the streets alone without fearing an attack from a 'dangerous predator'. 'It's offensive to all women, certainly to Jill Meagher's family. In some ways it's insulting to religious people too because it isn't about being out at 3am,' she said. '[Masa Vukotic] was out at 7pm at a time lots of us would be out walking. You expect to be safe from being attacked at any of those times. 'To have someone suggest that the problem is that you don't believe in God enough is ignoring completely what actually happens when there are dangerous men out attacking people.' Mr Bayley was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of raping and killing Ms Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012. Backlash: Twitter users didn't take the 'victim blaming' comments lightly . The priest faced harsh criticism for the comments he made in front of a group of primary school children . Since his conviction the extent of Mr Bayley's sordid past has come to light with revelations that he raped a Dutch backpacker and a St Kilda sex worker in the months leading up to the ruthless attack on Ms Meagher. Mr Bayley has now been found guilty of more than 20 rape offences. At the time of the murder he was out on parole having served eight years of an 11-year sentence for sex assaults in St Kilda.

"There has never been a better time to book a holiday due to the strength of the pound, a new study claims today. The cost of a holiday abroad has plummeted over the last two years as the sterling increases in value against dozens of foreign currencies. Research from travel money business, Centtrip, said Britons now got ‘more bang for their buck’ than in 2013 after the value of foreign currencies fells against the pound. British holidaymakers now have significantly more spending power in at least 14 major currencies . The study found holidaymakers have significantly more spending power in at least 14 major currencies, including the US dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The sterling is also at its highest level against the euro for more than seven years, giving a boost to British families planning holidays on the Continent. It means a family changing £100 through currency exchange will now get 21 euros more than two year ago. Tourists travelling to Russia will get twice as much rouble for £100 as they did in 2013, receiving almost 9,600 today instead of 4,600. The sterling is also at its highest level against the euro for more than seven years, giving a boost to British families planning holidays on the Continent . Meanwhile, those travelling to Norway will receive a third more krona for £100 in sterling, rising from around 900 to 1,200. Those travelling to the US will receive just four dollars more for their £100, after the pound grew by just 2 per cent against the dollar since 2013. Brian Jamieson, of Centtrip, said: ‘We are seeing unprecedented levels of strength in sterling and, as it continues to grow, the power of our spending money whilst holidaying abroad increases. ‘Many of our customers are locking in current attractive rates and buying Euros to use today or at a later date. A table shows the rise in value that the pound has experienced in the last two years against other currencies . ‘There has not been a better time for Brits to travel abroad.’ Centtrip was launched in January and offers a single prepaid MasterCard that can be used to pay in 14 currencies at the actual live currency rates, rather than incurring a bank’s conversion charges. Millions of British holidaymakers are expected to take advantage of the strong pound this Easter by booking cheaper breaks in Europe and farther afield. Research by the Daily Mail found that, if the euro continues to fall against the pound, a family of four could save almost £250 on a seven-night city break in Paris this July compared with July last year.","Cost of holiday abroad has plummeted as the sterling increases .

"With its green spaces, pavilions and cafes, this planned redevelopment of the Manhattan waterfront looks like any other city regeneration project. But in fact the plans have been designed with a far more serious goal in mind – to protect the island and its 1.6 million residents from a repeat of the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The 10 miles of parkland and public open space that skirt in a U-shape around Manhattan will in fact be used to camouflage raised barriers and deployable walls that will be essential to battle rising waters in the event of a storm. The project by Danish designers, the Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), aims to create a protective ribbon around lower Manhattan, shielding buildings from flood and storm surges. Scroll down for video . The Dryline project created by the Bjarke Ingels Group, will provide a protective ribbon around the banks of Manhattan to protect it from flooding . The aptly named Dryline has been brought to life in a new animated video produced by London based Squint Opera. It shows how the Manhattan coastline will be defended from floodwater by use of a series of berms or raised shelves. Deployable walls, clever planting, kiosks, sport areas, cycle routes and walkways have also been incorporated into the scheme that will defend the city. When fully completed the ambitious project will  run from West 57th Street, down to The Battery park and up to East 42nd street. 'You won't see it as a flood wall that separates the life of the city from the water,' Bjarke Ingels told Dezeen. An SIRR report recommends eight continuous miles of integrated coastal protection around Manhattan after Hurricane Sandy . The flooded defences should prevent flooding like that scene seen in Manhattan in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and also double as leisure amenities . Before and after: The Bridging Berm will provide 'robust vertical protection' for the Lower East Side from future storm surges and rising sea levels. PIctured: existing condition, left, and improved condition, right . This is the Bjarke Ingels Group's long term vision for the Bridging Berm, which will be transformed as part of the first phase of the scheme . Phase one: The Bridging Beam will create vistas over the Lower East Side of Manhattan that visitors will be able to use  to relax, socialize and enjoy river views . There are also plans for outdoor public pools, similar to the harbour baths in Copenhagen, to be incorporated into the proposals on 10th street as part of the Bridging Berm . Alongside the Bridging Berm a new scenic cycle way will be created for bike riders to enjoy on the banks of the Manhattan shoreline . This bridge, right, and the view of East River Park, left, will be improved as part of the first ambitious of the project to protect Manhattan . The Bridging Berm or shelf will provide robust protection for the Lower East Side from future storm surge and rising sea levels. This shows an accessible ramp connection that will make the greenspace available to all . Between the Manhattan Bridge and Montgomery Street, deployable walls are attached to the underside of the FDR Drive, ready to flip down to prepare for flood events. How the flip downs would work in the event of flood water surging towards Manhattan and the homes and businesses . 'When you go there you'll see landscape, you'll see pavilions, but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects Manhattan from flooding.' Hurricane Sandy left parts of New York in ruin when it battered the US eastern seaboard in October 2012, damaging 305,000 homes and leaving in its wake $19 billion worth of destruction . The Dryline was one of six winning projects chosen as part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Rebuild by Design competition. In fact, BIG was the only company to bid to create flood defences for Manhattan. 'It was a bit like going to a big dance,' Mr Ingels, told the Guardian. 'No one picks the pretties girl because they are all a bit shy.' In total $920 million was allocated to the winning schemes across the Sandy-affected regions of New York, New Jersey and New York City. This set of images show how a raised bank or berm will look in fine weather, right, and how it will protect the island for flooding, left .

A 'Reverse Aquarium' which enables visitors to observe tidal variations and sea level rise while providing a flood barrier also features in the design . Beautiful buildings that have been created as part of the architects vision for the waterfront parks in Manhattan . The Dryline was said to have been inspired by New York's High Line - an elevated park built on 2.5 kilmetres of disused railroad tracks transformed into a park. There are also now proposals to create the world's first underground park, known as the Low Line, in an abandoned trolley terminal below the Lower East Side. As part of the Dryline project, original called the Big U, the design team interviewed residents and local business owner's to ensure their plans would benefit the local communities. As a result the defences may take the form of a grassy knoll in one area, but public community space in another. The almost 90 degree angle of the New York 'bight' acts as a funnel directing storm surges directly into the heart of the city . This image show how hurricanes are becoming more and more frequent as the earth grows hotter . 'We're doing it in a way that will be in dialogue with all the neighborhoods along the Big U, so that what we're doing will never be perceived as a war zone, or a piece of resilience infrastructure,' Mr Ingels previously told Wired. 'When you go there in the future you will see amenities that are tailored to the neighborhoods. Undulating landscapes, street furniture, pavilions, that are part of an environmental and social program.' The project is set to be completed in three phases. The first phases, has been granted $335million funding from HUD, and will redevelop the Lower East Side. It will involving raising a 15ft tall bridging berm that will cut through East River Park and provide a barrier to protect low-lying ground, according to the Guardian. The Dryline project also features plans for swimming pools, aquariums, pavilions, and parks . The scheme, created by the Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), has been created with the help of local communities . When fully completed the ambitious scheme will create new public open spaces running from West 57th Street, down to The Battery park and up to East 42nd street . The design includes open spaces and sports areas that people will be able to use in good weather . Bjarke Ingels said: 'When you go there you'll see landscape, you'll see pavilions, but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects Manhattan from flooding.' Spanning a mile-and-a-half long, the earthen berm will provide a 'robust vertical protection' from future storm surges and rising sea levels. It will also offers   accessible routes into the park and provide space for relaxing, socializing, and enjoying views of the park and river. Between Manhattan Bridge and Montgomery Street deployable walls will be attached to the underside of the FDR Drive, ready to flip down to prepare for flood events. The panels will be decorated by local artists and provide a colourful ceiling above the East River Esplanade when not in use. The east and west boundaries of The Battery, that were key inlets during Hurricane Sandy, and led to the flooding of Lower Manhattan and close down the financial district. According to the plans by BIG - in partnership with ONE Architecture, Starr Whitehouse, James Lima Planning + Development, Level Infrastructure, BuroHappold, Arcadis, Green Shield Ecology, AEA Consulting, Project Projects and the School of Constructed Environments at Parsons - a berm and a series of knolls will not just provide protection, but also a place where people can sunbath, farm and garden. Fishing piers, an aquarium, swimming pools and pavilions are also said to feature in the 10-mile long scheme. The first phase of the project could be completed within in five years, New York mayor Bill de Blasio  told the New York Post last year.

"Killer: Ward Weaver III, a rapist who murdered two girls and is serving life in prison, was wrongly declared free by the system . A glitch in a prison system's computer system sent out thousands of false notifications that dangerous criminals had been released. The victim warning system, run by the Oregon Department of Corrections, fired out 8,000 inaccurate messages saying that criminals, including a notorious rapist and double murderer, were on the loose. Officials are still not sure why the technical error was set off on Friday evening, while the system was undergoing routine maintenance. Among the names caught up in the error was Ward Weaver III, a rapist who is serving life in prison for the murder of two girls. Some 1,900 inmates were falsely reported free. Local news station KGW, which signed up for alerts on Weaver, reported that they received the following message around 5:30pm Friday: . 'This e-mail is to inform you that WARD WEAVER has been released from custody as of 3/20/2015. 'If you have any concerns about your immediate safety, contact your local law enforcement agency, or if you have an emergency, call 911.' Brea Day, whose cousin was murdered, received a release notification, and thought it was real. She said she was 'instantly horrified', and prayed that it wasn't true. Calls flooded in to police from people who thought they were at risk. Still inside: Weaver, pictured above being locked away in 2004, is in fact still serving his sentence - but many victims of crime were plunged into panic by the misleading notifications . Prison: Weaver is serving his sentence at the Snake River Correctional Institution in Ontario, Oregon (above) In a statement, the Corrections Department said: 'Routine system maintenance appears to have triggered numerous notifications to victims in error'. The system in question, the Victim Information and Notification Everyday, is also known as VINE. It is maintained by technology company Appriss, who are now planning to contact everyone who was misled by the messages. They were not available for comment Saturday. This is reportedly the only time the system has gone wrong. Ten other states run similar systems. Oregon also runs an offender search tool, which the corrections department said can be used to find accurate information on inmates.","Oregon Department of Corrections system went wrong Friday evening .

"One man's 5,000 mile trek around Patagonia has been documented in a spectacular set of photographs. Polish adventurer Jakub Polomski, who specialises in landscape and travel photography set out on a 30-day trip around South America and took in some beautiful sights. Polomski actually started the trip back in February 2014, but due to his taking thousands of photographs, he has only just streamlined his fantastic collection. Scroll down for video . Bariloche in Argentina looks every inch the exclusive hideaway resort we all crave to stay in, with stunning views . Jakub travelled along the world famous Ruta 40 through Argentina, well known for thrill-seeking adventurers . Torres del Paine is a national park encompassing mountains, glaciers, lakes, and rivers in southern Chilean Patagonia . Polomksi's love for the earth's beautiful, and often mysterious, landscape has seen him travel to Argentina and Chile, as well as Slovakia, France and Norwa,y among others. He described his time viewing the Queens of Andes in Chile as 'the most beautiful national park,' and earlier this year he photographed one of the biggest glaciers in the world in Argentina, the Perito Moreno. More of Polomski's breathtaking photography can be see on his Facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/Polomski.Photographer and on his website. The Perito Moreno Glacier in Los Glaciares National Park in Argentina covers the equivalent of 35,000 football pitches . Torres del Paine is one of the largest and most visited parks in Chile, averaging around 150,000 visitors a year, of which 60 per cent are foreign tourists . El Chaltén is a small mountain village in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. It is located in the riverside of Río de las Vueltas . Speaking to MailOnline Travel, the 29-year-old, who lives in Cieszyn, Poland, said: 'The plan of this trip was very short. It was just departure and destination point, Santiago (Chile) and Ushuaia (Argentina). Everything else was changing. 'In our team there was an expert responsible for the list of stopovers. Sometimes negotiations concerning adding or removing point from the list were really tough. 'In the first part of our trip we were travelling by bus. We were going from Santiago through Melipeuco to Pucon. In Bariloche we decided to rent a car. So we rented small city car, but sometimes it was hard to drive hundreds of kilometres on gravel roads of Ruta 40. Sitauted at Villarica in Chile is one of the country's most active volcanoes, however this was obviously the calm before the storm . Polomksi's love for the earth's beautiful and often mysterious landscape has led him to travel to Argentina and Chile . The founding of the Argentinean town of Esquel dates back to the arrival of Welsh immigrants in Chubut in 1865 . 'After visiting Esquel, El Chalten, El Calafate, Perito Moreno Glacier, Torres del Paine we reached Ushuaia.' Polomski explained that he had visited Patagonia two years prior to this journey, but that 'five days were just not enough.' He added: 'The fantastic thing about South America is that you can always do something 'mañana' (tomorrow). Torres del Paine National Park, Chile . Perito Moreno Glacier . El Chalten (Fitz Roy & Cerro Torre), Argentina . Conguillío National Park, Chile . Ushuaia, Argentina . Bariloche, Argentina . Pucon, Chile . Villarica, Chile . El Calafate, Argentina .

Bariloche, emerged in the 1930s and 1940s as a major tourism centre with ski, trekking and mountaineering facilities . Ruta 40 is the longest route in Argentina and one of the largest in the world, along with the US Route 66 and the Stuart Highway in Australia . 'We had delays, so the plan of the trip was being updated daily. 'One of the main reasons I love this part of world is that people there are very polite to travellers.' The Polish photographer estimates that he snapped around 5,000 shots from his journey, and that only five per cent survived the final cut. 'I think it was better than I expected it to be,' he added. 'The weather was great, and in this region it is more than a half of success. This year I want to go to Iceland, Alps, and USA.' Some 500 miles from Santiago, Chile, lies the town of Villarica, beautifully situated in the shadow of the volcano with the same name . Patagonia comprises the southern section of the Andes mountains as well as the deserts, steppes and grasslands east of this southern portion of the Andes .","Jakub Polomski, who specializes in landscape and travel photography set out on a trip around South America .

"Ashley Pearson had her energy adjusted by healer to the stars (and their dogs) Paul Lennard . Ashley Pearson writes a weekly column on Femail Online about the joys and stress of motherhood for the career girl who may have come a bit late to the party, but is happy to be here just the same. This week she reveals how it feels to be 'healed' by hands from La La land... As an avid celebrity watcher I can tell you the buzz around energy healing in Hollywood these days is deafening. Apparently they are the new shrinks, psychics and therapists all in one. We know that Gwyneth Paltrow is a fan but also celebrities like Naomi Watts, Jessica Biel and Halle Berry are reportedly getting energy ‘adjustments’ during important photo shoots. Recently W magazine hailed energy healers as the ‘new shrinks’ amongst the A-list, and more and more celebrities have been experimenting with energy work to help with everything from pain, insomnia, weight loss, heartbreak, grief, anxiety, and depression. As crazy as it sounded, ultimately it was a trend I was happy to try. After all, who can’t use a little bit of an ‘energy adjustment’ now and again? I went to see Paul Lennard, who is the healer of choice for footballers, royalty and yes, dogs. (Apparently the A-list in Hollywood get their dog’s energy adjusted too; and I’m betting serious money that Jennifer Aniston is one of them). Meeting Paul, I immediately felt at ease; at the same time there’s an intensity behind those eyes. I saw him in London at the Shambhala Urban Escape in the Metropolitan by COMO, but Paul is a jet setter; he is currently in Spain at La Escondida Hotel hosting a retreat but frequently works out of celeb favourite Chiva-Som in Thailand, (he’s their most popular visiting therapist) and everywhere from Amsterdam to LA. The treatment itself is a mix of craniosacral therapy, psychic insights and Chi Nei Tsang - an ancient Taoist abdominal massage that releases blocked energy. As I lay fully clothed on a massage table, Paul scanned my body without touching it, and occasionally pressed a point which was excruciating. At other times, he appeared to pull invisible 'strings' from my body - stuck energy, apparently. He says that he’s guided in his work by what he can only describe as 'intuition' or a 'sixth sense' to clear old traumas that are showing up as current health problems in the mind and body. The therapy is said to address the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. According to Paul, these aspects are so intricately intertwined and connected that a physical problem may have its roots in an emotional difficulty. Once he has addressed the energy 'leak' or 'blockage', the body, he says, heals itself. Gwyneth Paltrow is a fan of energy 'adjustments' and in Hollywood energy healers are the 'new shrinks' As he worked, I felt so relaxed it was ridiculous. I felt weightless, like I’d just had an intense, hours long massage – without being touched. At one point, he asked me if I’d had any kind of a physical or emotional trauma around the age of 7 years old, one that caused me to be separated from my mom overnight. Without hesitation, I dismissed it and answered no. Then I remember I’d had surgery, a complicated tonsillectomy at age 7 and was in the hospital overnight. He also recognised other things about my character and spirituality without my saying very much at all. Naturally curious, I asked him how he does it and why. Although there’s no formal training for something like this, he told me that he began his career as a physical trainer and working with clients he began ‘seeing things’ – pictures and images that turned out to be connected to a trauma in the person’s life. Reiki is an ancient method of moving healing energy through your body through the hands of the practitioner . He clarified that he is not a psychic and he has no power to predict the future – rather he can sometimes look into the past, particularly if a past trauma has manifested into a physical blockage of energy. He says that he is ‘tuning in’ to the client's emotional history, clearing trauma that is stored at a cellular level. He claims that he can often 'see' where the body is unconsciously 'holding' the memory of an event or feeling which has a physical manifestation, most often in a negative way. As outlandish as it may sound, my overall feeling upon leaving was that just maybe these crazy celebrities are on to something. As I left I felt positive, relaxed and re-energised. Energy healing may not be for everyone but I found it to be something far more restorative than I had imagined it could be. Paul is currently hosting an ‘Energy Healing Week’ at La Escondida Hotel & Restaurant, a stylish luxury boutique hotel in Spain until the 18th March 2015. Guests will have three sessions with Paul on alternate days and three massages on the other days, with guided hikes through the Font Roja National Park as well as horse riding and cycling available. A one-hour treatment with Paul Lennard at La Escondida is €85, a minimum of 3-4 treatments are recommended for longer lasting benefits. www.hotelescondida.com .","Ashley meets the healer of choice for footballers, royalty and dogs .

"A North Carolina man who authorities believe sexually abused an eight-year-old girl in a child pornography video was arrested on Thursday. William Akers, 46, was taken into custody after authorities released a still image from the video and asked for the public to help identify him. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations kicked off a nationwide manhunt that brought more than 80 leads before one member of the public was able to tell investigators where Akers was employed. William Akers, 46, was arrested Thursday in Raleigh, North Carolina for allegedly sexually abusing an eight-year-old girl in a child pornography video seized by authorities . He was arrested at 1am while working the night shift at Lulu Press in Raleigh, where he was a development and operations director, according to WNCN. One employee told the station that Akers has since been fired. Authorities obtained the child pornography video Akers allegedly appeared in while investigating convicted sex offender Bailey Mills and his wife Elizabeth last year, according to the News & Observer. The Mills identified the man in the video as Peter Gilbert, but investigators soon realized he was using an alias. Homeland Security Investigations reached out to the public on Wednesday, asking them to help find a 'white male, 40 to 50 years in age' who 'may be using the name Peter Gilbert and may be driving a white pickup truck'. Akers was arrested after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations released this still image from the video and asked for the public's help in identifying him . Both Bailey and Elizabeth Mills were arrested last year for running a child porn ring disguised as a daycare out of their Sanford home, according to investigators. Bailey Mills was caught after a 12-year-old girl revealed to authorities he had contacted her on Facebook about exchanging money for sex, according to WNCN. The young girl also told officers she had previous sexual relations with Mills, and that she had been shown pornography featuring another underage girl while at his home. Bailey and Elizabeth Mills were arrested after investigators found photographic and video evidence that showed multiple underage children being sexually assaulted by adult males and an adult female. The victims were between one and 14 years old. Both Bailey and Elizabeth Mills pleaded guilty to multiple sex offense charges. Among Bailey Mills' charges were rape of a child and sexual exploitation of a child. Elizabeth Mills was also charged with sexual exploitation of a child and statutory sex offense with a child. Authorities obtained the child pornography video Akers allegedly appeared in while investigating convicted sex offender Bailey Mills (left) and his wife Elizabeth (right) last year in connection to a child porn ring . Akers has been charged with production of child pornography and conspiracy to produce child pornography, a Homeland Security Investigations spokesman told Daily Mail Online. He is being held without bond at Wake County Jail. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Sarah R. Saldaña said she was grateful for the public's 'quick action' to help find Akers. 'Within hours of our request for assistance, more than a million people took notice and started spreading the word on social media and in the press,' she said in a statement. 'Because of this incredible support, we were able to identify and arrest a man accused of grossly violating an innocent child.' The investigation was conducted under Homeland Security Investigations Operation Predator, an international initiative to protect children from sexual predators.","William Akers, 46, was identified after investigators released a still image from the video .

"A big service is one of the hallmarks of his game – now Andy Murray is taking a similar approach to his wedding. The tennis star and fiancée Kim Sears will tie the knot at Dunblane Cathedral and not, as anticipated, in the tiny chapel at his Cromlix House Hotel, near the Perthshire town where he grew up. For the 27-year-old’s many fans and friends in the town, it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. For many, the decision to hold the service in the cathedral will have added poignancy. Scroll down for video . Happy couple: Andy Murray and Kim Sears will tie the knot at Dunblane cathedral rather than the small chapel at Cromlix . It was there that funerals and memorial services were held for some of the victims of the 1996 massacre, in which Thomas Hamilton murdered 16 children and their teacher in Dunblane Primary School. Now Dunblane’s most famous son will marry there – 19 years after he hid under the headteacher’s desk until the shooting stopped. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray’s uncle Niall Erskine said: ‘I’m sure it will be a popular decision, as he’s had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. ‘Andy is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to Dunblane. I’m sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day.’ The cathedral’s minister, the Rev Colin Renwick, said: ‘I can’t confirm anything as we have a strict rule that we cannot discuss anyone’s wedding. ‘Wherever the wedding will be, there is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for Andy in Dunblane and a great deal of pride in him. I think people are genuinely very pleased for him.’ Old and new: Andy Murray will get married to Kim Sears at Dunblane cathedral (left) rather than the small chapel attached to Cromlix House (right) where the reception is still expected to be held . The couple announced their engagement in November after nine years together. They had been expected to wed at the 15-bedroom Cromlix House, which he bought for £1.8million in 2013. But it will still host family and friends before and after the service. Murray’s schoolfriend Stewart McClymont, 28, said: ‘It’s great. There will be loads of people in the streets. It will be like a Scottish version of the royal wedding. ‘I’m sure Andy’s delighted that the people who want to share in his day will all be there to celebrate. Andy’s a great ambassador and everybody is fully behind him in his sporting and private life. ‘People would love to get a glimpse of Andy and Kim on their special day.’ Local businesses were also delighted. Staff at Bennett’s Butcher, famous for its Murray tribute products, predicted a bumper weekend. Stuart Gavin said: ‘Everyone is excited just to see Andy get married, so for it to take place at the cathedral is even more special. ‘It will give the whole town a boost. I’ve a funny feeling Dunblane will be buzzing. We will definitely do something special to mark the occasion.’ Pauline Casey of gift shop Charisma said: ‘Everyone in the High Street will be delighted.’ Murray has said he may have three best men; his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier. It is believed Miss Sears will have four bridesmaids.","Couple will tie the knot at Dunblane cathedral not Cromlix House Hotel .

"A high-profile Ukip MEP has been expelled from the party after her chief of staff was filmed allegedly attempting to make fraudulent expense claims. Ukip last night said Janice Atkinson and her assistant Christine Hewitt had been kicked out for ‘bringing the party into disrepute’. A disciplinary hearing was held yesterday following allegations that Miss Hewitt had obtained a £3,150 invoice for a drinks party that cost £950 in a bid to ‘repatriate’ extra money from the EU. Scroll down for video . Ukip  said Janice Atkinson (pictured)  and her assistant had been kicked out for ‘bringing the party into disrepute’ Miss Atkinson, who is an MEP for the South East, had also been due to stand at the General Election as the candidate for the Folkestone and Hythe constituency. Police last week launched an investigation into allegations over the women’s event hosted by Mrs Atkinson at Ukip’s spring conference in Margate, Kent. Guests at the party, which was attended by Nigel Farage’s wife Kirsten, drank champagne, cocktails and dozens of bottles of wine. The event reportedly cost £950 and was paid by Mrs Atkinson’ chief of staff Christine Hewitt on credit card, but she later returned to the restaurant and was given an invoice for £3,150. Mr Farage said last week that he was 'deeply shocked' by the allegations and described it as 'one of the most incredibly stupid and dishonest things I've ever seen in my life' She was allegedly filmed telling an undercover reporter: ‘The idea is we overcharge them slightly because that’s the way of repatriating (the money).’ Nigel Farage was left reeling last week after losing three election candidates in less than 24 hours. The Ukip leader was left 'deeply shocked' after suspending MEP Janice Atkinson. Hours later the party confirmed a second senior figure, the party's candidate for Scunthorpe Stephen Howd, had been suspended following an 'alleged incident at his workplace'. The final blow came when the party's candidate for Westmorland and Lonsdale, Jonathan Stanley, sensationally quit claiming he was sick of the 'open racism and bullying' in the party. Mr Farage last week said: ‘I was deeply shocked when I saw it. It was one of the most incredibly stupid and dishonest things I've ever seen in my life.’ The party yesterday held a disciplinary hearing chaired independently by somebody from the legal profession with representatives of the national executive of Ukip. Last night in a statement, Mrs Atkinson said: 'I am deeply disappointed by today’s decision and fully intend to appeal. ‘I was elected to represent the constituents of the south-east of England and I will continue to work tirelessly on their behalf and for the best interests of our country.' A Ukip spokesman said: ‘Janice Atkinson MEP and Christine Hewitt, assistant to Janice Atkinson, have been found to have brought the party into disrepute. ‘As a result they have been expelled from the UK Independence Party. They have 14 days to appeal. ‘This means that Ms Atkinson no longer represents UKIP in the European Parliament and she will no longer be our prospective parliamentary candidate for Folkestone and Hythe.’ Mrs Atkinson, pictured with Nigel Farage as the South East England region results of the European Parliament elections were declared last year, was elected as an MEP last year after joining Ukip in 2011 . Mrs Atkinson was elected as an MEP last year after joining Ukip in 2011. The 52-year-old found herself in hot water last year after she was recorded by TV cameras calling the wife of a Ukip supporter ‘a ting tong from somewhere’. She insisted the comments were naive rather than malicious and said she was ‘incredibly sorry’ for offending the woman. In December it emerged that she owed more than £2,000 in child support to her ex-husband despite previously criticising ‘feckless families’ who have more children than they can afford. She has also been pictured sticking up her middle finger stuck up to a camera and was accused of swearing at protesters.

"A retired stockbroker with dementia shot his terminally ill wife before turning the gun on himself after telling a 999 operator the couple could 'only see death before them', an inquest has heard. Harold Ambrose, 82, used a licenced shotgun to shoot his cancer-stricken wife, Wendy, as she slept then shot himself, Chelmsford Coroners' Court heard. The 77-year-old mother-of-one had been given just six months to live just days earlier. The coroner was told that Mr Ambrose called 999 from the couple's £260,000 thatched cottage at 6.37am on May 24 last year, and told police he had shot his wife and intended to kill himself as 'we only see death and horrible things in front of us'. Harold Ambrose, 82, used a licenced shotgun to shoot his cancer-stricken wife, Wendy, as she slept then turned it on himself at their cottage in Essex (pictured), Chelmsford Coroners' Court heard . DC Lea Goodwin said: 'He informed the operator he had just shot his wife and planned to shoot himself in the very near future. 'He said his wife and himself were in love, we enjoyed life but now we only see death and horrible things in front of us. 'He terminated the call. 'She tried to call back but received no answer.' Armed officers attended the two-bedroom thatched cottage in the picturesque village of Boxted on the outskirts of Colchester, Essex, at 7am and found two bodies. Police discovered the body of Mr Ambrose in the garden while his wife's body was found in a chair in the living room that she slept in due to back problems. A post-mortem revealed Mr Ambrose suffered a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the face, while Mrs Ambrose had two gunshot wounds. The inquest today ruled Mrs Ambrose had been unlawfully killed while Mr Ambrose took his own life. Mrs Ambrose had been in and out of hospital in the months prior to her untimely death and was diagnosed with malignant adenocarcinoma - a type of cancer that forms in mucus-secreting glands through out the body - on May 6. Doctors had given her a prognosis of just six to nine months to live. But the inquest was told that Mrs Ambrose had raised the couple's concerns about moving into a home during a carer's home visit. Police discovered the body of Mr Ambrose in the garden while his wife's body was found in a chair in the living room that she slept in due to back problems . Coroner Eleanor McGann said: 'A carer visited the home on May 23 at 2pm. At that time Mrs Ambrose was talking about having to sell the house and move into a care home. 'She said they would be sad to leave the house.' The court heard that Mr Ambrose was the legal owner of a single-barrelled shotgun despite recent concerns about the onset of dementia. Police revealed they had performed the mandatory five-year review in Ocotber 2011 before these concerns were raised and his GP had failed to inform them of further developments. Chief inspector Glen Pavelin said: 'Had Essex Police been in receipt of information from the GP around his deteriorating health that would have generated a period of review and intervention.' Coroners Mrs McGann said: 'These are a very, very sad set of circumstances. 'I am going to draw the attention of the Home Office to the fact that GP's surgery was under no legal obligation to inform Essex Police of Mr Ambrose's dementia.' The inquest at Chelmsford Coroners' Court (stock picture) today ruled Mrs Ambrose had been unlawfully killed while Mr Ambrose took his own life . The couple had been described by neighbours in the village as 'pillars of the community', and at the time, neighbours paid tribute to the loving couple. Anne Grant, who lived nearby said: 'Harold and Wendy were a really likeable and very well-respected couple. 'They were very kind and friendly and had lived in the community for more than 30 years. 'They were pillars of the community. 'They were really smart and a couple who were very loving and close to one another. 'Wendy hadn't been very well and had been diagnosed with cancer and Harold was in the early stages of dementia.' One good friend and neighbour said: 'There is no way he would have hurt her without good reason. 'Mr Ambrose was a classic country gentleman - very traditional and law abiding. 'He would tip his cap to you if saw you in the lane. 'We know that his wife had suffered from poor health for several years. 'Recently she had been in and out of hospital with respiratory problems. 'My understanding of the facts is that he wanted to end her pain and could not bear to live without her.'","Harold Ambrose used  licenced shotgun to shoot terminally ill wife, Wendy .

Justice for Eliza: Two months after weeks-old Eliza Delacruz was found dead in a dumpster in a California border down, police arrested four suspects in connection to the girl's death . Mastermind: Police say 47-year-old Giseleangelique Rene D'Milian (left and right) came up with a plot to kidnap two babies, a boy and girl, to cover up her fake pregnancy . Ignoble resting place: Baby Eliza was discovered inside a trash container in Imperial City, California, January 4, after her kidnapper snatched her from her parents' home and shot her mother and uncle . Road trip: The gunman drove for 120 miles from Long Beach, where the three people were shot, to Imperial Beach on the Mexican border, where Eliza's body was found . The suspects were expected to make their first court appearance Friday. It wasn't clear whether they had retained attorneys yet or would request a public defender. 'In my notes, I had the word ""evil"" several times, and my staff told me to take it out but I can't summarize it any other way,' Police Chief Robert Luna said at an afternoon news conference. 'We intend to get a full prosecution and I hope that they .get hammered for this,'he said. 'This is just unbelievable.' The plot began when D'Milian, a self-styled 'mediation expert' and 'business coach,' falsely told her married boyfriend that she had given birth to his twins, a boy and girl, last December while she was out of the country, Luna said. 'In order to continue with this deception, she needed to produce two children who matched the ages of her fabricated twins,' the chief said. The first effort January 3 had D'Milian and McCall using separate cars to follow the mother of a young girl who boarded a public bus in Long Beach, Luna said. When the woman got off the bus and began to walk home, D'Milian stopped her Range Rover and briefly talked to the woman about her child, Luna said. Police Chief Robert Luna, at podium, speaks during a news conference in Long Beach Wednesday announcing the arrests of four suspects in the double kidnapping . Lingering questions: Police say they don't know to this time why the suspects killed Eliza Delacruz . Sad sight: Memorial flowers and balloons are placed outside the home of three-week-old Eliza Delacruz in Long Beach . Less than two hours later, McCall snatched little Eliza Delacruz from her home, shooting and seriously wounding her parents and uncle, Luna said. The next day, the baby was found dead in a dumpster in Imperial Beach, a city near the Mexican border and about 100 miles south of the girl's home. 'The reason baby Eliza was killed remains unknown,' Luna said. He didn't release the cause of her death. The next month, D'Milian arranged to find another baby by claiming she had a charitable organization that wanted to help young mothers and contacting her friends and acquaintances, El Segundo Police Chief Mitch Tavera said. On the morning of February 6, she targeted an acquaintance who had a 4-month-old boy, arranging for McCall to kill the woman and take the child from an El Segundo hotel in the 2000 block of East Mariposa Avenue, Tavera said. McCall allegedly savagely beat the woman with a baseball bat, but fled without the baby after hotel workers knocked on the door and the woman yelled for help, the El Segundo police chief said. Clues: Theses sketches released last week show the woman and man that were sought in connection to the abduction of Eliza Delacruz . 'She was starting over. This was a new kidnap attempt for them,' said Long Beach Lt. Lloyd Cox said of D'Milian. Long Beach police were aware of the El Segundo case. But the case came together in the last week after police released sketches of two suspects and details about a black Range Rover following Eliza's mother. Witnesses who contacted police gave investigators names that matched the suspects that El Segundo police were investigating in their case and provided the location of the SUV. Investigators are seeking other women with babies between one and two months of age who may have been contacted by text message about D'Milian's fake charity, Luna said.","Eliza Delacruz's body was found inside Imperial City, California, dumpster in January .

"A McDonald's customer was 'disgusted' when she discovered what appeared to be covered in beard trimmings in her McMuffin. April Gilmour, 24 from Kilmarnock, had already eaten half of the breakfast snack when she noticed the thick short dark hairs. The furious mother-of-two said she felt 'sick to her stomach' after making the gruesome discovery and posted a picture of the hairy sausage and egg McMuffin on Facebook on Wednesday which has now been shared more than 600 times. Mrs Gilmour was disgusted when she discovered what appeared to be covered in beard trimmings in her McMuffin . Mrs Gilmour believes the hair came from a staff member at her local McDonald's on Armour Street in Kilmarnock, Scotland, after she claimed the manager ran a 'clean shaven' policy. She wrote on Facebook: 'This was my sausage and egg McMuffin from McDonald's in Kilmarnock this morning. 'I had eaten half of it and opened it up to put more sauce in and noticed it was full of hair shavings. Disgusting! 'The manager told me they operate a clean shave policy - well clearly some wee radge has shaved all over their uniform and it's fell into my breakfast.' April Gilmour (pictured) had already eaten half of the breakfast snack when she noticed the thick short dark hairs . The beautician added: 'It's obviously an accident but I feel sick to my stomach thinking about it.' An area manager for McDonald's in Kilmarnock confirmed April had been in touch with the Armour Street branch of the restaurant about her McMuffin. Mrs Gilmour and her husband Ross, 25, said the experience had put them off McDonalds food for life. 'It's cheap junk anyway, but this is even more reason not to buy it,' said Mr Gilmour. 'It's definitely put us off for life. April felt disgusted. 'She had just got it and had gone to sit and eat it in her car when she found the hairs. She told the manager who was apologetic but said he could clearly see the hair in it. 'April decided to post the picture of it thinking we could warn people.' The picture of the McMuffin sparked a host of comments on Facebook, with one of her friends, called Sammi Rankin, writing: 'Do you normally have beard for breakfast ? You've ate someone's facial hair.' Katie Glass wrote: 'Beware of the hairy burger and eggs - you could be next.' Fi Balloch wrote: 'Man shavings.' While Kerri Campbell added: 'Boak. That would put anyone off.' A spokesman for McDonald's said: 'Ms Gilmour has been sent a letter of apology which should be with her tomorrow. An area manager for McDonald's in Kilmarnock confirmed April had been in touch with the Armour Street branch of the restaurant, above, about her McMuffin . 'We are sorry for her experience when visiting our restaurant. Food safety is our highest priority and both our restaurants and our suppliers place great emphasis on food hygiene and following rigorous standards in order to avoid imperfections in our products. 'We have launched an investigation following the reporting of this incident.' In January, fast food chain KFC apologised to an Ayrshire customer who found a deep fried feather in her barbecued chicken meal. It had apparently gone unnoticed as staff rolled the meat in its coating, put it through the fryer, left it to drain, and then put it in a box for serving.","April Gilmour discovered what appeared to be human hair in her snack .

"Taken during the twilight hours, a British photographer has gone to extraordinary lengths to get the perfect shot including climbing rooftops, hanging from helicopters and even entering restricted military areas. And Paul Reiffer's dedication to his work has enabled him to put together a portfolio showcasing the  beauty of some of the world's most famous cities by night. Each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails. Scroll down for video . City snapper, Paul Reiffer, 34, spent over three years amassing the collection of nightscapes, including this of Tower Bridge in London . The winding bridges of Yanan East Interchange in Shanghai are portrayed beautifully in the collection . Reiffer, 34, from Weymouth, Dorset, spent over three years amassing the collection of nightscapes and has visited some of the world's most iconic landmarks in the process. Whether it is the bright lights of the New York City skyline, the winding bridges of Shanghai, or the wispy reflections of Singapore's harbour, each of Paul's photographs reveal a beautiful side to the urban sprawl. By using a specially adapted camera that shoots at a whopping 80 mega pixels per image, the British photographer  is able to capture huge city landscapes in extraordinary detail. Constantly on the move, Paul is continuously travelling in an effort to add new locations to his already impressive portfolio. Then New York city skyline is perhaps one of the more noticeable landscapes from Reiffer's work . Behind the scenes of Pauls shoot in Shanghai; the photographer has spent three years collating his work . Each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails; here the lights of Sydney Harbour reflect in the waters . Paul said: 'Some of my images require a lot of planning, unfortunately, one of the ways I decided to get a different view was to get onto rooftops. 'Some with full permissions and authorised access, others less so. 'Ironically, while legitimate access takes a lot of bureaucracy, it's the more 'unofficial' shoots which take the most planning. 'Generally if you search online, or see a city in a magazine, the same old shots will appear time and time again, so while I use other images for reference, I tend to then start researching using tools like Google satellite view and 3D maps along with sunrise/sunset apps to plan my own take on the view of a city. The serene and still waters reflect the bright lights of Singapore, a hive of activity . A gorgeous sunset of the golden gate bridge, San Francisco reveals a beautiful side to the urban sprawl . The roads may be devoid of traffic here in Kuala Lumpur, but it simply gives the light trails more prominence . 'The shot of the Nanpu Bridge in Shanghai was the most difficult shot to take of the collection, while hanging from helicopters and lying in the middle of roads sounds challenging, photographically this was a real pain. 'Let's just say you need to trust the front half of your feet to get to the place, as that's the only part which will be touching the ledge of a building as you walk along it 30-odd storeys up in the air. The shimmering Auckland skyline in New Zealand looks majestic against the backdrop of the dark waters . The buildings of Kuala Lumpur look palatial, and show off in terrific lighting by Reiffer's camera skills . Reiffer captures the jam-packed nature of New York City from high above most of the buildings . 'I've had to run from some locations with a memory card in my underwear before now! Not because of anything illegal, more an argument with an overzealous security guard on a building I was photographing from. 'Because of the resolution of these images, they can be printed big and when you see a cityscape at two or three meters wide and are able to see every detail of every parked car, building window or landmark in the distance, it's quite impressive.'

"Iraq claims it has liberated the city of Tikrit - its biggest victory  in the fight against Islamic State terrorists to date. Security and allied forces, backed by U.S.-led coalition aircraft retook the hometown of former president Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi tricolour was raised. The operation began on March 2 and had looked bogged down before Iraqi forces made rapid advances over the past 48 hours. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi 'announces the liberation of Tikrit and congratulates Iraqi security forces and popular volunteers on the historic milestone', his official Twitter account said.

Liberation: Iraqi security forces launch a rocket during the operation to retake the city of Tikrit on March 31 . He was referring to paramilitary groups which played a major role in the fighting to retake Tikrit, a Sunni Arab city which ISIS had controlled since it captured swathes of Iraq in June last year. Iraqiya state television showed footage of houses previously used by the terror group in liberated areas, but it was not clear whether any pockets of resistance remained. The provincial government headquarters was retaken on Monday, and on Tuesday the Iraqi tricolour replaced the black ISIS flag on the building. In a statement to AFP just minutes before Abadi's tweet, his spokesman Rafid Jaboori said: 'Iraqi forces reached the centre of Tikrit, raised the Iraqi flag and are now clearing the city.' There no immediate information on how many fighters were killed, wounded or captured in the fighting. The government has not provided any casualty figures since the operation started a month ago. Iraqi army and police forces, as well as volunteers and Iran-backed Shiite militias, completely surrounded Tikrit within two weeks of launching the operation. There was a lull in fighting when government and allied forces apparently balked at the number of snipers, booby traps and trenches which ISIS was using to defend the city centre.

Raising the flag: A member of the Iraqi security forces holds an Iraqi flag during the operation to retake the city . Smoke rises from central Tikrit during clashes between Iraqi security forces and Islamic State extremists on March 31 . Iran was Baghdad's top foreign partner in the early stages of the operation, but Iraqi air force strikes were proving insufficient to break the back of IS resistance. The government eventually requested strikes from the U.S.-led coalition which has been assisting Iraqi forces elsewhere in the country since August last year. American jets began bombing ISIS targets in Tikrit on March 25. France also took part in the campaign. The move sparked a freeze in the participation of the Popular Mobilisation units, an umbrella organisation for volunteers and militias which accounted for the bulk of the manpower involved in the Tikrit battle. The Pentagon had expressed unease at the role played by Iran and its proxies in the battle and said it conditioned its intervention on regular forces taking the lead. On Friday, it hailed the withdrawal from the fight of 'those Shiite militias who are linked to, infiltrated by, (or) otherwise under the influence of Iran'.

Security and allied forces, backed by U.S.-led coalition aircraft retook Tikrit - the hometown of former president Saddam Hussein - and the Iraqi tricolour was raised . But after giving themselves political cover by declaring that they do not want to work with each other, both sides took part in the Tikrit operation this week. Tikrit, which once had an estimated population of around 200,000, had been largely emptied of civilians by the time the government operation was launched at the start of March. The fate of those who were believed to have remained in the city was unclear on Tuesday. Thousands of people displaced last year or more recently from Salaheddin province, of which Tikrit is the capital, have started returning to their homes in outlying liberated areas. But the level of destruction Tikrit is believed to have suffered and the threat posed by unexploded bombs mean residents of the city itself could take longer to return. Tikrit holds both strategic and symbolic importance. It was the hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein, remnants of whose Baath party collaborated with ISIS last summer. Since June, Iraqi forces had tried and failed several times to retake the city, seen as a key stepping stone to recapturing Mosul, the jihadists' largest hub in Iraq.

"A man was left with horrific scars after his abusive wife poured a jug of scalding water over him after a rowed about household chores. Ken Gregory, 65, suffered first and second degree burns to 14% of his body after the assault at his £295,000 bungalow in Peterborough in March last year. A year on, pictures of his injuries show painful blistering stretching from his scalp to his lower back - and some of the scars will never fade. Scroll down for video . Ken Gregory was left horrifically scarred after his now ex-wife threw boiling water over him   in March last year . Mr Gregory met Teresa Gilbertson (pictured together) through ballroom dancing, but they relationship became sour after five years of marriage . His ex-wife Teresa Gilbertson, 60, is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent following the attack. Mr Gregory has decided to speak out because he believes it is important to challenge the stigma surrounding men who are victims of abuse. Retired BT manager Mr Gregory said: 'Being attacked by a woman is nothing to be ashamed of.' 'I had never imagined something like this would happen to me. 'As a man who is a bit older and who isn't exactly small, there is a perception that you can't be a victim of domestic violence. 'I was worried that people would assume that it was my fault and she was the victim - there is still a general perception that, as a strong man against a weaker female, you must have been the protagonist. A year on, the retired BT manager is speaking out to challenge the stigma surrounding men who are victims of abuse. Pictured, Mr Gregory with the jug his ex-wife used . Mr Gregory's ex-wife Teresa Gilbertson, 60, is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent following the attack. Pictured, injuries to his back (left) and shoulder (right) 'But it should be the same message that they put out for women many years ago: don't be frightened, you don't have to put up with it.' The couple met through ballroom dancing following the death of Mr Gregory's first wife   of more than 30 years, Maureen, seven years ago. But after five years of marriage, their relationship soured. On the day of the attack on March 23, Mr Gregory had been due to take flowers to his late wife's memorial to mark her birthday.  Instead the couple rowed over finances and household chores. Eventually, they reached an apparently mutual  decision to get a divorce and Gilbertson had offered to make a cup of tea. Mr Gregory, who has limited mobility due to arthritis, turned down the offer, but his wife left the room and returned with a jug of freshly boiled water. Peterborough Crown Court heard she told him 'there you go' after tipping it over his head without warning. It was the culmination of escalating verbal abuse. Three weeks earlier, Mr Gregory needed hospital treatment after Gilbertson threw a cup of tea over him while he slept, in what she claimed was an accident. When police arrived following the final incident, Mr Gregory said she told officers: 'If I'd wanted to kill him, I'd have used a knife.' Reliving the incident, Mr Gregory said: 'I was sitting with my back to her and it came without warning. 'It was unbearable, searing pain - I'd never known anything like it. 'Afterwards I could barely sleep as I couldn't lie on my back.' Mr Gregory, who has limited mobility due to arthritis, said the injuries meant he barely sleep after the attack . Experts told the trial that the pattern of the injuries showed the water must have been poured deliberately - and not by accident. Mr Gregory said: 'From the start, the police took it very seriously and even our mutual friends were able to see that I was the innocent party. 'If other men find themselves in this position, I would say don't be embarrassed or ashamed - my case goes to show that this can happen to anybody.' Detective Inspector Mark Woolner, from Cambridgeshire Police's domestic abuse unit, said the force has specially-trained officers who support both male and female victims of domestic violence. He said:  'Men affected by domestic abuse often feel that they won't be taken seriously, but this simply isn't the case.' Gilbertson will be sentenced on March 24 after being found guilty earlier this month.","Ken Gregory suffered first and second degree burns to 14% of his body .
