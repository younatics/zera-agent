"David Cameron will not be able to continue as Tory leader until 2020, Iain Duncan Smith warned today as speculation over the Prime Minister's future mounted. Last week Mr Cameron vowed to serve 'every day' of a second term if he is re-elected on May 7, right up to the next election at the end of the decade. But Mr Duncan Smith, himself a former leader, today insisted that Mr Cameron will have to stand before that to allow time for his successor to be chosen. Scroll down for video . Iain Duncan Smith, himself a former leader, today insisted that Mr Cameron will have to stand before that to allow time for his successor to be chosen . Mr Cameron stunned the Tory party with his dramatic revelation that he would not seek a third term. The remarks triggered the start of an unofficial Tory leadership race, after he also tipped Boris Johnson, George Osborne and Theresa May as potential successors. The Tory leader joked: 'Terms are like shredded wheat : two are wonderful but three might just be too many.' The admission, in an interview with the BBC, caused dismay in large parts of the Tory party because it distracted from the party's core election message on the economy, and over-shadowed last week's news that inflation had fallen to zero per cent. Mr Cameron defended his remarks, insisting he was 'just giving an honest answer to an honest question'. Challenged on the Sky News/Channel 4 election debate, he insisted: 'If you vote Conservative I've said I will serve every day of a full second term.' But at the very least he would need to stand aside several months before May 2020 to give his successor time to prepare for the general election. There has been speculation that Mr Cameron could quit after his promised 2017 referendum on leaving the EU, whatever the outcome. Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show the PM would choose the timing of his departure and he would be 'sorry to see him go'. David Cameron has revealed he will not seek a third term if he wins the next election on May 7 . Mr Cameron backed Boris Johnson, Theresa May and George Osborne as potential successors when he quits as Tory leader . Asked if Mr Cameron has to 'stand down at some point during the next Parliament' in order to allow a successor to be in place for the election, Mr Duncan Smith said: 'He does. But I have huge faith in the Prime Minister. I think, given the nature of the terrible circumstances we inherited, under his leadership he's turned the economy around and taken some tough decisions. 'He will do what he says, which is he will serve what essentially is a full term. Of course, there will be a competition at some point, but I have to tell you that will be a competition on the back of a successful Prime Minister doing something that most prime ministers have never done before - saying 'I know when it's time to go'. 'You've had to literally rap the knuckles of people like Gordon Brown and previous prime ministers to get them to think of going. He is actually very keen to say 'There is a limit. There's an amount of time a prime minister should serve before they get stale.' And he is right about that.' In the BBC interview when the Tory leader announced his plans to stand down, Samantha Cameron made a rare appearance on screen to endorse her husband as the right man to lead the country . Mr Duncan Smith was Tory leader from 2001 to 2003, when he was forced out in a vote of no confidence. He said it was 'a different world' then, as the prime minister was at that point able to select the date of the election and it was 'very difficult to say what a full term was'. The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act had allowed prime ministers to plan ahead with certainty about how long their term might be, he said. Mr Duncan Smith refused to be drawn on the identity of possible successors, but suggested that it would be someone who is already in the public eye. 'I don't think that you're going to have in any shape or form a brand-new leader that the country has never seen, because all the people that might want to stand for that will have been up in the public sphere for some time,' he said. 'I'm not going to name names. I know that those who want to throw their hat in the ring will throw it very hard and those that don't will think about it.'","David Cameron stunned Tory party by ruling out seeking a third term .

"Education minister Christopher Pyne has posted an image of a fortune cookie on Twitter, prompting a slew of comments from social media users speculating about the move. The picture, uploaded to Twitter on Wednesday night, showed a fortune cookie with the message: 'Insist on what you are doing. Your goal will be reached soon.' The postcomes after Pyne failed to convince the Senate on Tuesday to pass his university reform laws this week for the second time, prompting requests from Labor for Pyne to be sacked, reported Sky News. Christopher Pyne uploaded the image Twitter on Wednesday, sparking a torrent of ridicules from people accusing him of taking advice from a cookie . The post has seen Pyne taken to task on social media, with dozens of users lambasting him for seemingly taking advice from a cookie. Rose Steele wrote : 'You should be basing your #highered on public support not a fortune cookie' 'I prefer Ministers to not take their advice from cookies', wrote Lady of Polly Tricks. Pyne has been attempting to overhaul the education system, introducing laws that would allow universities to set their own fees and financially penalise graduates who do not repay their student debts, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Despite the second time failing to convince the Senate, Pyne has vowed he will never give up on his higher education campaign. Speaking to Nine news, Pyne said: 'I never give up, no, I will not give up. It's too important to allow the Labor Party who are political opportunists and the Greens who are the same, to wreck this reform.' Opposition higher education spokesman Kim Carr has claimed Pynne's relationship with the Senate is now 'poisonous'. 'This minister's bluff, his bluster, his bravado simply leaves people cold,' Senator Carr told ABC on Wednesday. 'It is time for him to consider his future and if he doesn't then he should be sacked.' Speculation has now emerged that the government is considering launching a double dissolution over the education bill.","Christopher Pyne posted image on Twitter on Wednesday evening .

"Crude roadside bombs filled with toxic chlorine gas are now being used by Isis terrorists, it has been reported. Iraqi officials say government forces have defused dozens of the devices in the course of their war with the fanatics and have produced video footage which backs up their claim. One Iraqi bomb disposal expert said that the use of the chemical is a sign of desperation. Crude roadside bombs filled with chlorine gas are now being used by Isis terrorists, it has been reported . Haider Taher told the BBC: 'They're resorting to this new method, putting chlorine in these home-made roadside bombs, which is toxic to those that inhale it.' He described how his team detonated a bomb in Tikrit that, unbeknown to them, contained chlorine. They immediately began feeling the effects of the chemical, experiencing 'painful choking' and blocked throats. The BBC has been shown footage of bright yellow gas rising up from a roadside bomb explosion that the Iraqis say is chlorine, as well as film of the Tikrit explosion. Jennifer Cole, Senior Research Fellow at defence thinktank Royal United Services Institute, told MailOnline that although chlorine can be lethal, it does appear that it's being used to spread fear by Isis. She said: 'Chlorine is easily available from a number of industrial sources and is very hazardous – causing breathing difficulties in particular and in extreme cases prolonged exposure can kill. 'Used in roadside bombs such as this, in the open air, it disperses reasonably quickly and so appears to be intended to cause panic rather than serious harm.' She added: 'There is no doubt that public perception often sees chemical weapons such as this as more dangerous than conventional weapons such as explosives, even though it may not be the case that a chlorine bomb could cause more harm. In fact, the most damage is likely to be done by the explosion created to disperse it.' Chlorine was used by the British in the First World War, but it proved to be unreliable. In one attack in 1915 the gas blew back into British trenches after canisters of the chemical were fired from heavy guns at the Germans. Shocking: This footage purportedly shows toxic chlorine gas which was released from a roadside bomb destroyed by Iraqi soldiers in Tikrit recently . The use of chlorine bombs by Isis (pictured) is a sign of desperation, one expert told the BBC . The U.N. Security Council recently approved a United States-drafted resolution that condemns the use of toxic chemicals such as chlorine in Syria, while threatening militarily enforced action in the case of further violations. All members of the 15-seat council approved the resolution except for Venezuela, which abstained. The resolution follows last month's condemnation by the world's chemical weapons watchdog of the use of chlorine in Syria as a breach of international law. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons' fact-finding mission concluded 'with a high degree of confidence' that chlorine was used on three villages in Syria last year, killing 13 people. The OPCW did not assign blame, but some council members such as Britain, France and the United States have blamed Syria's government for the attacks, pointing out that the fact-finding reports linked chlorine attacks to helicopters and that only Syria's government has helicopters. Chlorine is not a chemical that has to be declared to the OPCW because it is also used for regular purposes in industry. Russia on Friday again expressed skepticism about blaming the Syrian government, which is its ally. Syria denies using chlorine or other chemical weapons and blames 'terrorists' for such attacks.","Iraqi officials say they've defused dozens of the devices in past few months .

"When it comes to relationships is honesty really the best policy? Some experts insist that baring all to your significant other can do wonders for improving intimacy and communication. But do you really want or need to know how many people the love of your life has had sex with? In a new video from Elite Daily the rather uncomfortable question is posed to couples on camera: 'Do you guys know many people each other has slept with?' Do you really need to know how many people the love of your life has had sex with? In a new video from Elite Daily  couples were asked: 'Do you guys know many people each other has slept with?' 'When I was in college, those numbers got stupid!' Some of the men weren't afraid to share . The reactions are brilliantly awkward as the couples admit that they have never asked the question, and then um and ah as they decide whether to reveal their magic numbers to each other. One woman nervously twists her hands as she admits: 'I think I've been a little more on the sexually adventurous side throughout my youth,' while another puts her fingers in her ears to stop from hearing her boyfriend's number. The guys are a little more impressed with their hook-up history with one saying: 'When I was in college those numbers got stupid. I played football. Those numbers got out of hand.' Another reveals, laughing: 'A little over the 150 number. I'm not afraid to admit anything about my past because it's brought me to where I am today.' One women refused to reveal her number, only for her husband to declare: 'We might talk about this later.' 'We might talk about this later,' this man was bemused by his partners refusal to reveal all .

"The real-life Paddington bear who suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and fur is closer to finding a new home, thanks to the generosity of Mail on Sunday readers. After the plight of Cholita was highlighted by this newspaper last week, readers donated an extraordinary £30,000 to Animal Defenders International, which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in Peru earlier this month. The elderly bear lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus, where she was kept in a 5ft by 5ft box, and her teeth were broken and her claws removed to prevent her from defending herself. Scroll down for video . Cholita (pictured) lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus in Peru . Cholita - known as the real-life Paddington bear (pictured) - suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and fur . The money raised will allow the organisation to travel more than 600 miles on treacherous mountain and desert roads, which are often little more than dirt tracks, to reach the bear in a zoo near the north-western city of Piura and drive her to the Peruvian capital, Lima. The two drivers and the truck, equipped with a new cage, hay and blankets, will alone cost £2,700, and the bear will also need help from veterinary staff and a support team, who will fly to Piura in advance. When the organisation has cleared the red tape needed to allow Cholita to leave the country, they will fly her and 33 lions they have rescued from other circuses in South America to the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado in the United States, where she can live out her days in peace. Because she is a spectacled bear, the same endangered species as Paddington in the children’s books by Michael Bond, there are stringent conditions to be met before the authorities permit her to cross state boundaries. The organisation, which campaigns against the exploitation of wild animals, will have to delay Cholita’s flight by several weeks to ensure she is allowed aboard, at a further cost of thousands of pounds a day, so it is still appealing for funds. Its president, Jan Creamer, said: ‘We have been overwhelmed by the response from Mail on Sunday readers to help Cholita. We now need one last push so that she can begin her journey to freedom. Please give generously and help us save Cholita and give her the life she deserves.’ Mail on Sunday readers donated an extraordinary £30,000 to Animal Defenders International, which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in Peru earlier this month .","Cholita lost most of her hair because of the stress she endured at circus .

"Philip Ewington, 62, said he is 'trying to see the funny side' after the Royal Mail sent his post to the wrong address for six months . A frustrated customer said he is 'trying to see the funny side' after the Royal Mail sent his post to the wrong address for six months – including their own letters of apology. Philip Ewington, 62, said letters and packages clearly marked for his Bedford flat have been delivered to another home on the same street for at least half a year. The retired analyst, who lives alone, said the problem usually happens on Wednesdays when his mail is in the hands of a relief postman. He first complained to Royal Mail last year when some family photos he sent to his mother's address never turned up. They sent a letter of apology - which arrived at flat G in the block at number 10 rather than flat G at number eight where he lives. He said: 'It may seem like a quite a small thing in the scale of the things, but when you're post just keeps on getting delivered to the wrong place over and over again it is very frustrating. 'I am trying to see the funny side of it. I keep asking my neighbour when he's going to move out, so I can move into his flat. Maybe then I'll get my post delivered. 'No one seems to understand why this is happening, it's bizarre.' Mr Ewington said he was in the process of drawing up his will and was awaiting important documents from his solicitor. He added: 'It is laughable. They can't even send a letter of apology to the right address. 'If we post a birthday card with the wrong postage we receive penalties, but they just don't seem that bothered. 'They keep saying they are going to escalate it to the manager but nothing ever happens.' The Royal Mail said: ' We would like to sincerely apologise to the customer for the problems he has experienced with our delivery service and the inconvenience this has caused. 'Procedures have been put in place which include daily checks by the delivery office manager and staff briefed on the importance of correct delivery and maintaining the high level of service our customers expect and deserve.'

"X Factor star Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has joined fellow Geordie TV celebs Ant and Dec in questioning whether she can still vote Labour. The pop superstar said it was 'hard' for her because all her friends and family supported the party - but said she already paid 'a f****** lot of tax' and needed to listen to what the other parties said. Mrs Fernandez-Versini, who has built up an estimated £20million fortune, said she was now a mature woman  and felt a greater responsibility to be well-informed about politics. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini said Mr Miliband proposed mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million would 'f*** me over' It came after 'staunchly Labour' TV stars Ant and Dec attacked the Labour leader Ed Miliband and questioned whether they could vote for him. Other celebrities, including Myleene Klass, Angelina Jolie, Sol Campbell and Bill Oddie have also publicly criticised the Labour Party over the proposed Mansion Tax on expensive homes. But the popular X Factor judge's remarks are likely to particularly sting because of her life-long support for the Labour Party. David Cameron and George Osborne have also made tax cuts the centre of their pitch for re-election. The Tories want to clear the Government's £90billion deficit without any tax rises - while Labour has called for the rich to pay more. Mr Miliband has pledged to restore the 50p tax rate on those who earn more than £150,000, introduce an annual levy on homes worth more than £2million - dubbed the mansion tax - and raise the point at which high earners start paying 40 per cent of their income to the government. Mrs Fernandez-Versini told the Telegraph's Stella magazine that she would 'listen' more carefully to other parties now that she paid so much in tax. The 'Crazy Stupid Love' singer also suggested she could 'make my own party' adding that 'stranger things have happened'. 'It's hard for me, because all my friends and family vote Labour,' she said. Asked if she would consider voting for David Cameron, she replied: 'Not really. I want to hear what everyone's got to say. 'I've always been Labour all my life but I want to hear what they've got to say for myself. Now that I'm a mature woman. 'I feel like a greater responsibility now to vote for who runs our country. And I pay a f****** lot of tax. So I think that I need to have a really well-informed, well-educated opinion.' The 'staunchly Labour' TV stars Ant and Dec attacked Mr Miliband and questioned whether they could vote for him . The X Factor darling has built up a fortune since her pop career took off after being voted onto the pop band Girls Aloud on the 2002 TV show, Popstars The Rivals. Despite growing up on a council estate as one of five children in Newcastle, she now earns a reported £2million a year as a judge on X Factor and face of L'Oreal. Last year, she married French playboy Jean Bernard Fernandez Versini - who owns pop-up bar Cosy Box in Cannes. It came after she divorced England footballer Ashley Cole in 2010 citing ‘unreasonable behaviour’ after numerous allegations of cheating on his part. Despite her wealth Mrs Fernandez-Versini said there were 'big downsides that come with having money'. Ed Miliband's proposed mansion tax has been attacked by a string of celebrities . She said: 'As many as with not having money. I mean, they're different types of stresses, but they're both stresses.' Mrs Fernandez-Versini later claimed on Twitter that her remarks had been taken out of context, adding: 'I am a labour supporter, but will always want to hear what everyone has to say.' Her comments come after presenter Myleene Klass attacked Mr Miliband over the policy, claiming it would hit 'little grannies' whose homes had increased in value over decades, rather than the super rich. Actress Angelina Jolie said she could be 'put off' from moving to Britain by the proposal, which would come in this year if Labour wins on May 7. Mr Miliband was left bruised after And and Dec questioned whether he was up to be Prime Minister. Declan Donnelly, 39, said he had always voted Labour but was unimpressed with Mr Miliband. He said: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.' His Britain's Got Talent co-star Ant McPartlin – also 39 – said the pair were 'staunchly Labour' but didn't know if they could vote Labour under Mr Miliband. The remarks appear to echo public concern over Mr Miliband's leadership, with just 80 days until the election. According to the latest polls, more than half the public think Mr Miliband is doing a bad job – with less than a quarter happy with his leadership. His overall approval rating has slumped to minus 29. This is stark contrast to David Cameron – who splits opinion down the middle, according to the pollsters Opinium. The PM has a net approval rating of minus one. Despite Mr Cameron's personal advantage, Labour continue to be ahead by two points in the polls – on 35 per cent, compared to the Tories who are stuck on 33 per cent. Ant and Dec, speaking to the Times, said they followed politics 'keenly', but were disillusioned with Labour and the Tories. Mr McPartlin said: 'I voted Labour all my life. But last election I voted Tory because I was thoroughly disillusioned with the Labour government. 'Now I'm thoroughly disillusioned with a coalition government. I feel we're both staunchly Labour and would vote Labour if we could, but I don't know what their philosophy is any more.' Mr Donnelly added: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.'","Cheryl Fernandez-Versini said all her friends and family voted Labour .

"A man who allegedly stabbed teenage twins leaving one 'millimetres from death' is being hunted by police today. The suspect, who is described as  between 20 and 30-years-old, is accused of attacking the 16-year-old brothers with a 'very sharp blade' following a party in Dilton Marsh, near Westbury in Wiltshire, last night. One of the boys remains in a serious but stable condition in Southmead Hospital in Bristol after the knife slashed his chest, only narrowly missing his heart. The suspect, who is described as between 20 and 30-years-old, is accused of attacking the 16-year-old twin brothers with a 'very sharp blade' at a roundabout in Dilton Marsh, near Westbury in Wiltshire (pictured) The other teenager suffered cuts to his hands and has since been discharged from hospital. Detective Inspector Paul Franklin, of Wiltshire Police, said the suspect approached the twins, who were part of a group which had gathered at a roundabout in the village following a party, before threatening them. Some members of the group then chased the attacker, who police believe was unknown to the teenagers. Mr Franklin said: 'We've been told that an unknown man approached the group on the roundabout and threatened them. 'He was chased by several of the teenagers but produced a knife. 'One of the brothers was slashed across the chest and is lucky to be alive because the knife wound was so deep it was close to his heart. He was just a couple of millimetres from death. 'The other brother received cuts to his hands and was treated in hospital in Trowbridge and discharged. 'This was an extremely serious assault with a very sharp blade.' The twins were among a group of young people who had gathered at the Dilton Marsh roundabout following a party in the village. A footpath along the main road near the roundabout was sealed off today as officers continued to search for the knife used in the assault. One of the teenage boys remains in a serious but stable condition following the attack in the rural village (pictured) last night. Police are hunting the knifeman and believe he may have suffered facial injuries . Police said the suspect fled the scene following the attack and remains at large. He is described as being 5ft 8in to 5ft 9in tall, with 'shortish' black hair, and was wearing a blue jacket and either blue jeans or grey jogging bottoms. Officers believe it was likely that he was bleeding from a facial injury which he suffered during the fight and urged any witnesses to come forward. Mr Franklin said: 'I urgently need to hear from anyone who was at the party or who witnessed what happened around Tanyard Way between 11pm and midnight on Saturday.' Anyone with information should contact police on 101.","Man accused of stabbing teenage twins is being hunted by police today .

"A slaughterhouse boss at the centre of the 2013 horsemeat scandal has been fined £8,000 after failing to provide paperwork for horse carcasses he sold. Peter Boddy admitted one count of failing to abide by EU meat traceability regulations after being unable to back up claims he had sent nearly 40 carcasses to Italian restaurants. Another 12 horses from his slaughterhouse in Todmorden in West Yorkshire were sold without any records ever being kept. The 65-year-old claimed that rather than sell them on without knowledge of where they were going, many were purchased by caterers in the market for horsemeat. Peter Boddy (left) and David Moss (right) have become the first people sentenced over the 2013 horsemeat scandal. The pair worked together at an abattoir in Yorkshire where records of more than 50 carcasses were lost . Boddy and his slaughterhouse manager David Moss were involved in the 2013 scandal which saw hundreds of people mistakenly sold the meat. They were both sentenced at Southwark Crown Court today, the first of anyone involved in the furore, with Moss given a four month prison sentence suspended for two years. The court heard how Boddy did not produce adequate paperwork for 55 horse carcasses he had sold and accepted 17 animals into his abattoir without the appropriate documents. When questioned, he told officials that 37 had been sold to two Italian restaurants in Manchester and Leeds. Investigators could not verify his story, claiming neither of the establishments existed. 'When inquiries were made of the relevant councils, nothing was found that confirmed the existence of businesses with those names,' said prosecutor Adam Payter. The court heard how in 2013, Food Standards Agency requested paperwork for carcasses that passed through the slaughterhouse in 2012. At the time Moss admitted much of their business was done 'cash in hand' and without a detailed paper trail. Days later he forged an invoice requested as a result of the meeting. Southwark Crown Court heard how the 65-year-old claimed almost 40 of the carcasses were sold to Italian restaurants but this was never verified . While investigators could not tell exactly when and where the animals had been slaughtered, Mr Payter said there would have been no cause for dishonesty if they had worked to the rules. Peter Boddy was fined £8,000 for breaching EU rules on the traceability of food. General Food Law states that 'food and feed business operators shall have in place systems and procedures to identify the other businesses to which their products have been supplied'. However, Boddy could not back up claims he had sent 40 horse carcasses to Italian restaurants. After admitting one charge of failing to abide by this traceability law, the maximum sentence Boddy could have faced was a two-year sentence and an unlimited fine. 'There would be no cause to cover up the provenance or destination of horsemeat unless there was something underlying wrong with that horsemeat,' he said. 'It can’t be said where they were slaughtered, when they were slaughtered, whether it was on site - but horsemeat passed through Peter Boddy’s slaughterhouse without being properly documented.' He admitted while critics could point to the slaughterhouse for the supply of horsemeat involved in the scandal, doing so was purely 'speculation'. There was no proof to suggest either Boddy or Moss tried to pass off horsemeat as anything else which was the basis for public outcry in 2013. Sentencing Judge Alistair McCreath emphasised this, but noted the importance of properly documenting meat for health and safety reasons. Moss told investigators much of the slaughterhouse in Todmorden in West Yorkshire was done 'cash in hand' ‘Accordingly I must sentence each of you not on the basis you were complicit in putting horse meat into the human food chain. ‘What I do however sentence you for in your case, Peter Boddy, is for the failure to keep proper records and, in your case David Moss, for committing an act of forgery to frustrate the investigation.’ Judge McCreath added: ‘There may be those who may say, ""well why does this matter?""... well people do care and they care for good reason. ‘The traceability of food products, here meat, is of critical importance in relation to public health. ‘If meat causes ill health then it is important that those responsible for investigating the cause and trace it backwards and backwards and backwards to find where the problem lies and to prevent the problem escalating and those who keep poor records frustrate that very important public interest and interest which touches on public health and public safety. ‘It matters so because the pubic are entitled to be confident in that process to know that if something does go wrong,’ he said. Products by Findus were among those to have traces of horse found in them . In January 2013, it emerged Tesco and other major retailers had been selling burgers which contained . large proportions of horse. The contaminated meat was found to . have come primarily from a factory in Ireland, which apparently sourced . its 'beef' from Poland. As well as Tesco, Burger King, the . Co-op, Asda and Aldi scrabbled to repair their public image and withdraw . tainted products from shelves. The scandal escalated in February when it was revealed that frozen-food firm Findus had produced beef . lasagne which was almost entirely made up of horse meat. In response to traces of the animal being found across Europe, the Food Standards Agency instructed 2,501 tests to be carried out in Britain. Twenty-nine positive results were found in seven products which had, by the time of testing, already been recalled. These included some Findus lasagne as well as some Aldi lasagne and spaghetti bolognese - all made by the Comigel food processing company in France. Some of the products were found to contain up to 100% horsemeat.","Peter Boddy sold 55 horse carcasses without keeping record of the sales .

"Connor Chambers, now aged 18, of Oxley, Wolverhampton, was handed an 18-month detention and training order after he was found guilty of possession of a knife after a street brawl . Three teenage thugs whose terrifying gang battle with knives and a hammer was caught on camera have been jailed. An imitation gun was fired and a teenage girl was battered to the ground as children watched on in horror while the group of 20 thugs 'bristling with weapons' brawled in the streets of Wolverhampton in April  last year. Footage taken on a mobile phone captured the horrifying scenes as they unfolded outside the Britannia Hotel before the violence spilled into the hotel foyer. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the battle took place between the Firetown and the 623 gangs who joined forces to confront another unnamed rival group. An imitation firearm was fired in the air by a 16-year-old who then pointed the weapon at another of the girls while Connor Chambers, 17, was seen waving a knife at a rival. The boy with the hammer was chased by Nathaniel Nugent, 19, - who wore the distinctive red flash of the Firetown gang - along with fellow gang member Shamar Fairclough, 19. The schoolboy fled into the foyer of the Britannia Hotel where he was involved in a scuffle and was later found to have suffered a stab wound to the chest that required five stitches. Three teenagers were jailed and two handed a community order after the brawl in front of shocked shoppers. Chambers, now aged 18, of Oxley, Wolverhampton, was handed an 18-month detention and training order after he was found guilty of possession of a knife.

Three teenage thugs whose terrifying gang battle with knives and a hammer in Wolverhampton was caught on camera have been jailed. A boy with a hammer was chased into the Britannia Hotel and later found with stab woubds . The boy with the hammer was chased by Nathaniel Nugent, 19, - who wore the distinctive red flash of the Firetown gang - along with fellow gang member Shamar Fairclough, 19 . The innocent girls were part of a group who had just arrived in the city to enjoy a night out but found themselves thrust into the middle of the gangland row . A teenage girl was struck with a hammer as children watched on in horror while a group of thugs brawled in the streets of Wolverhampton . Fairclough, 19, of Shifnal, Shrops., agreed to be bound over for 12 months at a previous hearing. The boy with the gun, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given an 18-month detention and training order. The 15-year-old boy with the hammer admitted possession of an offensive weapon, assault and affray and received an 18-month youth rehabilitation order under supervision and an eight-month night time curfew. The 70-second clip filmed by a witness showed two youths launching their attack and battering two young women as they cowered on the ground at 8pm. Judge Andrew Lockhart, QC, told them: 'You came for a meeting between two groups which, if not actively planned, was enthusiastically anticipated. Footage taken on a mobile phone captured the horrifying scenes as they unfolded outside the Britannia Hotel . 'Those involved were bristling with weapons. 'There were at least two knives, a hammer and an imitation firearm and there are likely to have been more. 'The groups were out on the streets of this city armed to the teeth and looking for trouble.

"A Ukip parliamentary candidate has been replaced after he called for Barack Obama to be kidnapped. Jeremy Zeid, who was standing in Hendon, said the President should be treated in the same way as a Nazi war criminal after the U.S. declassified documents about Israel’s nuclear capability. He wrote on Facebook: ‘Once Obama is out of office, the Israelis should move to extradite the b*****d or “do an Eichmann” on him, and lock him up for leaking state secrets. After all what's sauce for the Pollard goose is sauce for the Obama gander, don't you think?’ Jeremy Zeid said  the Israelis should kidnap the US President - pictured in Boston, Massachusetts yesterday -  once he was out of office . In response to a comment, he added: ‘Nah, just kidnap the bugger, like they did to Eichmann, who suddenly found that he'd woken up in Israel. ‘The problem is that Israeli jails are far more humane and adherent to human rights than American ones.’ Mr Zeid was referring to Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi SS officer who played a major role in the Holocaust. After the Second World War he fled to Argentina, but was kidnapped by Israeli security services and put on trial in Israel before being executed in 1962. Ukip today announced that Raymond Shamash, an NHS surgeon, would instead be standing in the seat. Mr Zeid wrote a further post on Facebook complaining that whoever had made his comments public a ‘squealer’ and ‘vermin’. Mr Zeid said he stood by his comments and likened himself to the French cartoonists massacred in Paris last year. He said: 'Remember that phrase ‘Je Suis Charlie’? Well, freedom of speech. '[President Obama] wants to do a deal with Iran - which wants to wipe Israel out, to see the Jewish State gone to dust. Left-wing Jewish people do not want to deal with it.' UKIP parliamentary candidate Jeremy Zeid (left) called for Barack Obama to be kidnapped by the Israelis like Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann . He told the Jewish Chronicle that he was quitting as candidate for Hendon. He said: 'I am done with politics because people focus on the minutiae.' A UKIP spokesman said yesterday: 'Jeremy Zeid resigned as a candidate last week, citing his health. Ukip accepted his resignation.' Last year, in a string of tweets, Mr Zeid caused a stir by saying: 'The almost absence of white faces in Ilford is worrying.' He went on to attack Labour MP for Ilford South, Mike Gapes, accusing him of being 'either blind to or deliberately complicit in the ethnic cleansing of Ilford which I’m sure will be called ""racist"".'","Jeremy Zeid said Mr Obama should be treated like a Nazi war criminal .

"The Mayor of Rio de Janeiro has admitted that the city's heavily polluted waterways will not be cleaned up in time for next year's sailing events at the Olympic Games.

"Firefighters were working through the night to tackle a massive blaze at the historic Battersea Arts Centre in south London. Billowing black smoke could be seen for miles around the Grade II listed building after the fire began at just after 4.15pm today. Witnesses claimed people watched on in tears as flames engulfed the tower at the top of the centre, which then collapsed. London Fire Brigade had twelve engines and more than 80 firefighters battling the fire at the height of the inferno but a spokesman said crews were making 'steady progress' to get the blaze under control. Scroll down for video . A massive blaze has broken out at the historic Battersea Arts Centre in south London at just after 4.15pm, which has damaged the roof of the building . Flames had engulfed the roof of the Grade II listed property which later collapsed into the theatre building which was surrounded by scaffolding . 'We have got the fire surrounded,' he added. 'Good progress is being made, salvage operations and fire investigations are now underway. 'We anticipate we'll be there for the rest of the night.' By midnight on Friday, the fire service had scaled back the effort to four fire engines and around thirty firefighters as they managed to get the fire under control. It is estimated that at least a third of the building has been badly damaged with some parts, such as the tower, completely destroyed. An ambulance service spokesman said crews had treated a woman for smoke inhalation at the scene but she had not required hospital treatment. So far, the cause of the fire is unknown. Nicholas Bennett, a magistrate at nearby Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court, said earlier this afternoon that black smoke had been 'everywhere, engulfing the  area.' Rumours that the nearby Clapham Junction railway station had been evacuated were confirmed false by Network Rail but Lavender Hill is closed in both directions as the fire services continued to fight the blaze. Battersea Arts Centre confirmed everyone had escaped the building and that there would be no performances for the next two evenings. A spokesman for the theatre tweeted just after the start of the blaze: ''There is a fire in our building. Everyone is out safe and the fire brigade are working hard to get the fire under control. 'We will not be running any performances this evening and we have also cancelled the performance of Missing tomorrow evening. The outline of the Grade II listed building disappears in the smoke and flames that engulf the roof and destroy the roof tower . This incredible photo shows the flames of the inferno reaching up into the sky behind nearby homes who were warned to keep doors and windows closed against the smoke . London Fire Brigade confirmed that as much as a third of the building has been damaged by the fire with some parts being completely destroyed . 'If you've bought tickets for any show we'll be in contact about refunds or exchanges. 'Thank you to everyone for the kind words & well wishes.We'd also like to thank @LondonFire, @metpoliceuk & @Ldn_Ambulance who are handling the situation rapidly, safely and compassionately.' London Fire Brigade Station Manager John Snelgrove, who was at the scene, said: 'This is a large, challenging fire and crews are working hard to bring it under control. We've got 12 fire engines at the scene, as well as an aerial appliance and an aerial ladder platform fighting the fire from above. 'Firefighters are working with a number of water jets around the building to contain the fire.' Twelve fire engines and around 80 firefighters had been called to tackle the fire Battersea Arts Centre with two aerial appliances - similar to cherry pickers - used to fight the fire from above. People living and working nearby were also warned to keep doors and windows closed against the billowing black smoke. At the outbreak of the blaze the Brigade's control officers took over fifty 999 calls from members of the public. Billowing black smoke could be seen for miles from the arts centre as the fire took hold, which needed almost 60 firefighters to try and tackle it . Officers make their way to the blaze in Lavender Hill which has now been shut in both directions as firefighters continue to battle the fire . The London Fire Brigade said that eight fire engines and more than 80 firefighters were dealing with arts centre blaze in Battersea . The arts centre had tweeted: 'There is a fire in our building. Everyone is out safe and the fire brigade are working hard to get the fire under control.' Comedian Paul Foxcroft, who saw the blaze, told Channel 4: 'The first thing I saw when I came out of my house were several fire engines hurtling past, then I saw grey smoke in the sky. 'Crowds had started to gather. There were two ladies outside with tears in their eyes. I heard one saying 'Please save it' as more firemen arrived. 'It is an institution, not just for Battersea, but for the whole of the city of London. It is hugely popular so this fire will affect a lot of people. The back of the building was under renovation.' People have been tweeting of their horror as the fire engulfed the Battersea Arts Centre's Grand Hall roof. Dan Price tweeted: 'So sad. London Fire fighting bravely to save Battersea Arts. Everyone is out safely.' Senior Producer at the BAC Richard Dufty tweeted: 'Terrible news. Battersea Arts is on fire. The Grand Hall roof.' Tom Copley ‏said: 'Oh no! Battersea Arts, one of London's most wonderful theatres, is on fire. Hope that no one is hurt and that the building can be saved.' An ambulance service spokesman confirmed that crews had attended the scene but no-one was injured, while occupants nearby were warned to keep their windows closed against the billowing black smoke . The fire could be seen clearly from a nearby train station, sparking fears that Clapham Junction was being evacuated- the rumours were later confirmed as false . Fans of the centre also tweeted their support including James Phillips who tweeted about the 'tragic loss' of the building . Baylen Leonard wrote on Twitter: ' Awful news about fire at Battersea Arts Centre, one of the most innovative and forward thinking arts centres in UK.' Louise Allen-Jones posted: ' Devastated to hear Battersea Arts Centre is on fire. Love that building so much.' One twitter user said: 'Tower on the top of Battersea Arts Centre has just collapsed. People in tears. Police moving people back.' James Phillips added: 'The Battersea Arts Centre fire is apparently contained but large parts of the Grand Hall (which survived the Blitz) are gone. A tragic loss.' The building, which was designed in 1891 by E. W. Mountforcentre, was originally opened in 1893 as Battersea Town Hall. The space was converted to a community arts centre in 1974. The popular arts venue hosts a regular series of plays and dance shows. It is a registered charity, which raises 70 per cent of its own income every year.

"An enormous monument recording the scoreline of every England national football team defeat is expected to sell for £600,000 at auction. Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan created the untitled piece in 1999 to celebrate the England national side's regular disappointments. Etched into black granite was every occasion the England side lost, from their 2-1 defeat to Scotland in 1874 up until Romania's 2-1 victory at the 1998 World Cup. The enormous granite piece of art (pictured) is expected to sell for £600,000 at auction . The artwork begins with a 2-1 defeat to Scotland in 1874 and ends with 1998's World Cup loss to Romania . The artwork, which is made of black granite set in MDF and steel, is 7.2ft high, 10ft wide and 2ft deep. The piece starts with England's 1874 loss to Scotland and ends with its 1998 World Cup loss against Romania. If continued until today, it would also incorporate Britain's losses to Uruguay and Italy in last year's World Cup. Also etched onto the granite would be the team's 4-1 humiliation at the hands of Germany in 2010 and the 2006 exit on penalties against Portugal. The piece of art will be auctioned off next week at Sotheby's New Bond Street gallery in London. The monument is being offered with a guide price of £400,000 - £600,000, which the average England footballer could pay for with one months' salary. CNN reported Cattelan as explaining it was 'a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death'. Cattelan is notorious for his often satirical and biting art displays. Perhaps his best known piece is an effigy of Pope John Paul II being crushed by a meteor. Stuart Pierce's spot kick against West Germany is saved in the 1990 World Cup semi-final match, as England crashed out of the competition on penalties . Sol Campbell and David Seaman scramble as Romania's Viorel Moldovan scores a goal in England's 1998 2-1 defeat . Pictured is the moment David Beckham is red-carded in England's second-round match against Argentina in 1998, as his teammate Paul Scholes watches on in dismay. They went on to lose the game on penalties . And two years ago he made headlines when he placed a statue of Adolf Hitler praying on his knees in the former Warsaw Ghetto. Jewish groups expressed fury at the 'senseless' decision to install the provocative artwork in the area where thousands of Jews were forced to live during the rule of the Nazi regime. In total, around 300,000 Jews from the Ghetto died or were sent to their death in concentration camps. The statue, entitled 'HIM', attracted a large number of visitors when it was first installed in November 2012. The work was visible only from a distance, and the artist did not initially say what he intended viewers to read into Hitler's pose. Organisers of the exhibition of which the statue was a part said its point was to make people reflect on the nature of evil - but others were furious by its placement in such a sensitive site. Had the artwork continued to the current day, it would include England's 2006 World Cup loss to Portugal. Pictured is Wayne Rooney receiving a red card in the quarter final .","Huge granite monument created by Italian artist set to sell for £600,000 .

"Federal prosecutors are reportedly preparing criminal corruption charges against New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, the result of a grand jury probe that has lasted two years. Menendez, 61, has seen pressure from the Obama administration over his positions on Cuba and Iran. And he has long faced ethics questions about his relationship with Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, a wealthy and prolific donor. The senator's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on his friend's behalf, pushing back against accusations of overbilling the Medicare system by $8.9 million. Menendez has also repaid Melgen $58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor's private jet, mostly to the posh Dominican Republic resot Casa de Campo. But his spokeswoman fiercely denied he has done anything illegal even as a conservative group is calling for him to resign and face the music. THE SENATOR: Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption . POLITICS: (l-r) Menendez, donor Salomon Melgen, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and her husband Paul, posed in February 2012 at a National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials gala . Tricia Enright, Menendez's communications director, told Daily Mail Online in a statement that 'we believe all of the Senator's actions have been appropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that.' 'Any actions taken by Senator Menendez or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason.' 'The Senator has counted Dr. Melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades,' Enright said. 'The two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other’s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts.' COY: Attorney General Eric Holder wouldn't talk on Friday about whether charges are forthcoming for Menendez, saying 'I can't comment' She called the investigation's beginnings 'suspect,' referring to 'false allegations' that have been 'discredited' in the past. Meanwhile, the conservative activist group American Commitment has called on Menendez to resign his office. On a new website called ByeBob.com, the group claims he 'unethically, and likely criminally, compromised his ability to represent the people of New Jersey.' CNN reported that the investigation into Menendez is reaching a crescendo, with prosecutors under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out on some charges. Attorney General Eric Holder, according to the network, has already given his approval. But he insisted 'I can't comment on that' when a reporter asked him about the report Friday afternoon after Obama gave a speech in South Carolina. Menendez's first high-level meeting at HHS related to Melgen's Medicare troubles occurred on June 7, 2012, according to court documents seen by the New Jersey Law Journal. The government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with Marilyn Tavenner, who was then in charge of the agency's Medicare and Medicaid subagency. Court papers also indicate Menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call, and then took Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, to an August 2, 2012 meeting with the Department of Health and Human Services's then-secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. CNN reported that Melgen was one of the Medicare system's most-reimbursed doctors nationwide, during the years when he was also a major donor to Menendez and to the Majority PAC. That political action committee, run by former Reid staffers, collected more than $700,000 from Melgen and made sure $600,000 of it benefited Menendez’s re-election campaign. The senator, now the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman until two months ago, has become a thorn in the White House's side by taking positions that grate on President Obama. Menendez opposed the presdient's rapprochement with Cuban strongman Raul Castro, saying in December that his actions 'have vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.' He has stood in the way of the State Department's negotiations with Iran, threatening to lead Congress in imposing new sanctions on the Islamic Republic if it doesn't shelve its nuclear ambitions. The White House has insisted the Iranians can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain. 'I have to be honest with you,' Menendez said during a January 21 Capitol Hill hearing. 'The more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran.' While he is not among the senate's super-rich elites, the New Jersey legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges: His legal defense fund has already collected, and spent, more than $1 million. Last week two of his Senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case, arguing that the senator's actions, and theirs, are protected by the U.S. Constitution's 'Speech or Debate' clause. Those words in America's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny, including Justice Department investigations, while they are actively working on legislation. THE DOCTOR: Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida ophthalmologist and a major Menendez donor, was ordered to pay back Medicare for $8.9 million in overbillings, and Menendez intervened with HHS for him . SEARCH WARRANT: A January 30 raid of Melgen's medical practice yielded van-loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files . According to the New Jersey Law Journal, aide Michael Barnard refused to answer 50 questions about Menendez's conversations with Sebelius and Tavenner, and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator's office and Melgen's lawyer-lobbyist about those conversations. Another more senior aide, former Menendez chief counsel Kerri Talbot, reportedly refused to testify about a separate mattter. The grand jury wanted to know if Talbot had emailed a staffer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port-screening equipment – principally cargo-container x-ray machines – to the Dominican Republic. Melgen, the senator's donor, controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through. The x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband. NARCO-POLITICS: Dr. Melgen controlled a company that wanted a Dominican ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs. Menendez allegedly helped ensure the U.S. wouldn't provide the machines for free . In 2013 FBI agents and investigators from HHS raided Melgen's West Palm Beach, Florida medical office, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. Over a period of nearly 24 hours, then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing whatnews reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files. The Washington Post reported at the time that HHS auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments Melgen's practice billed to Medicare. Other news reports described an alleged scheme in which Melgen used leftover fluid from single-use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients, billing Medicare for a new vial with each treatment. The government typically paid $2,000 for each container, raising the possibility that Melgen could have overbilled Medicare between $4,000 and $6,000 per vial.","New Jersey Sen.

"Air China flight attendants have been accused of being ‘sloppy and careless’ after a plane was photographed in flight with its door not properly locked. The photo of the Boeing 737-800 was snapped this month at Beijing Capital International Airport and went viral after it was uploaded onto Chinese social media networks. It showed the door’s lock out of position while the plane was in the air at China’s busiest airport, drawing criticism from air safety experts. This photo showing a plane door's lock out of position went viral on Chinese social media networks . Air safety expert Guang Yu told local media: ‘It is probably not dangerous because there are various safety measures in place but it shows an extremely sloppy and careless attitude on behalf of the cabin crew.’ Chinese state media agency Xinhua quoted an Air China spokesman as saying that the airline conducted a thorough investigation, including interviews with the plane’s crew and other staff, after the photo surfaced online. It said the investigation found that the lock was in the ‘normal’ position when the flight took off. A Boeing specialist quoted by Chinese state media said that human error or a mechanical problem with the lock could result in an external lock being out of position. Air China said an investigation found that the lock was in the proper position when the flight departed . The expert added that a mechanical problem would not affect flight safety because of another locking system operated from within the cabin. The report also said that it appeared to be a case of mechanical failure. The photo sparked debate on Chinese social media website Weibo, and was shared after several incidents involving Chinese passengers opening plane doors before take-off or after landing. Last week a 42-year-old Chinese man was detained for 10 days after he opened an emergency exit shortly before a Urumqi Airlines plane was due to take off. The man told authorities that he thought the door handle was a handrail that he could grab onto for support, ‘like the handrail on a bus’. A Urumqi Airlines flight was delayed last week after a passenger opened the emergency exit . He was removed by police and detained for causing a disruption for others on board the plane, which was travelling from Urumqi to Zhengzhou. That incident was at least the fifth time since December a passenger has opened an emergency exit on a plane in China. Last month, an unidentified man was detained for 10 days after opening a plane emergency exit as passengers were boarding at Nanjing airport, the South China Morning Post reported. He told airline staff ‘The door is not important’ when they asked him why he opened the door, the newspaper reported. In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors on a China Eastern flight in Chengdu . In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors in protest of a weather-related delay as their China Eastern flight taxied to a runway in Chengdu. It led to a longer delay for everyone on board. A month earlier, a man was arrested after he opened the emergency exit ‘to get off quicker’ after a China Eastern flight landed in Hainan. By unlocking an opening the emergency exit, he deployed the emergency slide. Also in December, a rookie traveller yanked open a door on a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu to ‘get some fresh air’ shortly before it was supposed to take-off.","Air China said it conducted an investigation after the photo surfaced .

"Three weeks before Echo Huntley died, aged just 36, she and her twin brother, Hollywood star Noah, went for a walk in the Sussex village where they grew up. ‘It was a beautiful day,’ remembers the actor, who shot to fame in the 1990s playing long-haired hunk Luke McAllister in ITV’s Emmerdale, and recently appeared in the box office hit Dracula Untold. ‘We had a cream tea and then wandered up to the 11th Century church.’ As early summer sunlight dappled through the trees on to the ancient graves, Noah idly asked Echo where she’d like to be buried. He recalls: ‘She said in her slightly dismissive way, “Oh, I don’t know. Maybe there,” and pointed to a damp and shady corner of the churchyard.’ Noah asked Echo if she wouldn’t want somewhere more picturesque to rest but, having made her choice, she seemed adamant. Scroll down for video . Close family: Twins Noah and Echo Huntley, aged around 15, with their six siblings and parents . Noah, 40, could never have known it, but it was a conversation he would be repeating to his family just a few short weeks later, as they tried to enact her final wishes. Echo was a lifelong sufferer from the neurological condition epilepsy, but, before she died, appeared to have turned a corner in her treatment. Then she suffered a catastrophic seizure during a day out at the beach. Three days later, on June 6, 2010, she passed away from multiple organ failure. And so Echo was laid to rest in the spot she had chosen, quite befitting the unconventional life she had chosen, living with her carpenter husband Iain in a gypsy wagon, and breeding pheasants for a living. Epilepsy, which affects about one per cent of the population, is due to damage to the tissues of the brain which causes disruption in communication between nerve cells. This can occur through head injury, stroke, meningitis and genetic conditions, or birth trauma – which is rare, but perhaps was a factor in Echo’s case. Noah and his sister came from a large family of eight children including, remarkably, three sets of twins. When she was born, Echo spent four weeks in hospital. ‘She turned blue just after birth,’ explains Noah. Soap star: Noah, who is now 40, played heart-throb Luke McAllister in Emmerdale from 1993 to 1995 . People with epilepsy have a tendency to recurrent seizures and the type and severity depends on the part of the brain damaged. Alongside drugs known as anti-convulsants, management of the condition involves a healthy lifestyle that includes regular sleeping patterns. In some cases, surgery can help. Noah says: ‘As a family we are unconvinced by mainstream medicine for the most part, and relied predominantly on nurturing her ourselves. She rejected most anti-convulsants because of the side effects.’ Dr John Jacob, consultant neurologist at Milton Keynes and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trusts, and BMI Saxon Clinic in Milton Keynes, says: ‘Anti convulsants have long been the mainstay of treatment for epilepsy no matter what form it takes. This is in part because of the very small risk of death when the seizure is prolonged or sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. But it can be hard for younger patients to commit to a drug which they need to take for long periods or even the rest of their lives.’ While they were growing up, the Huntleys lived a bohemian existence in Sussex, with all the children home-schooled. Echo had her first seizure aged nine. Noah says: ‘Doctors felt being at home was the best thing for her, with a twin growing at the same chronological rate and able to support her. There were differences between us academically which became more pronounced as we grew up,’ Noah continues. ‘I was looking to go to Oxford University. Echo led a normal life apart from the odd seizure, and she stayed locally.’ Noah joined the cast of Emmerdale aged 19 and then, as his film career took off in his 20s, divided his time between Los Angeles and London. Echo became his solace from the ‘madness’ of showbiz. Red carpet: Noah (right) with Dracula Untold co-stars Luke Evans and Sarah Gadon at the premiere last year . In her 20s, unable to drive because of her seizures (the DVLA requires patients to be seizure free for a year to hold a licence), Echo began taking medication and for a decade, this worked. Then her symptoms returned with a vengeance. Seizures typically last just a few moments but in severe cases, they can occur in quick succession, or continuously – and any episode that lasts for more than five minutes requires urgent treatment as there is a risk of brain damage. Echo’s fits were lasting 30 minutes or more. ‘Such seizures are often triggered by something,’ says Professor Ley Sander, Director of the Epilepsy Society, Professor of Neurology and Clinical Epilepsy and Honorary Consultant Neurologist at University College London. Perhaps an infection or forgetting medication. But sometimes they just happen without explanation.’ In Echo’s case, no one will ever know why, on a hot May day at Shoreham beach near Brighton with her husband, she suffered a two-hour seizure. An ambulance took her to intensive care, where her family were called to her bedside. She never regained consciousness. Throughout our conversation Noah is introspective, speaking about the idea that when one twin dies and the other survives there is a ‘connection between heaven and earth’, and that seeing a bird trapped in the eaves of a church ‘felt like a symbol’. But, perhaps like his sister did when choosing her memorial, he also sees humour even in the bleakest moments. And he speaks of the dreadful time with gentle humour: ‘The day after she died, my agent called, oblivious to what was going on, and said, “We’ve got this great audition. It’s for a film called Waking The Dead…”’","Actor Noah Huntley's twin sister Echo was born with severe epilepsy .

"Police are hunting a runaway mother who tortured her two young children into inventing claims that they were abused by a Satanic sex cult run by their father. A specialist police child abuse team is investigating Ella Draper, 42, and her partner Abraham Christie after they forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture in Hampstead, North London. Dozens of innocent people were falsely named as paedophiles as part of their online campaign. Scroll down for video . A specialist police child abuse team is investigating Ella Draper (pictured left) and her partner Abraham Christie (right) after they forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture in north London . Draper was in the middle of a battle with the children's father, Ricky Dearman, 46, over access arrangements when she falsely accused him of sexual abuse, which resulted in him receiving death threats. Draper, who is now believed to have fled abroad, is wanted for questioning by police over the false allegations which she continues to make in online videos and articles, sparking fears of vigilante attacks. A judge last week branded her claims that her children's father was leading a 100-strong Satanic paedophile ring based at Christ Church Primary School in Hampstead as 'utter nonsense'. Mrs Justice Pauffley named and shamed Draper and Christie in a written ruling on care proceedings brought by a local council and said their internet campaign about the cult was ‘evil’ and ‘baseless’. The judge completely cleared Mr Dearman and all others named in the campaign of any abuse and called the material published on the internet ‘nothing more than utter nonsense’. ‘I am entirely certain that everything Ms Draper, her partner Abraham Christie and the children said about those matters was fabricated,’ she said. ‘The claims are baseless. Those who have sought to perpetrate them are evil and or foolish. Draper was in the middle of a battle with the children's father Ricky Dearman (pictured) over access arrangements when she accused him . The judge also suggested the couple may have fed the two youngsters, aged eight and nine, cannabis soup to gain their compliance. Mrs Justice Pauffley ruled: 'Torture is the most accurate way to describe what was done by Mr Christie in collaboration with Ms Draper. 'Both children were assaulted by Mr Christie by being hit with a metal spoon on multiple occasions over their head and legs, by being pushed into walls, punched, pinched and kicked. 'Water was poured over them as they knelt semi-clothed.' More than four million people around the world have viewed the online material and police were forced to protect worried parents at the gates of Christchurch Primary School where the ‘main action’ was alleged to have happened, the court heard. The ‘grotesque’ claims against ‘blameless’ people included drugged babies being sent from abroad by courier services such as TNT and DHL to London and then sacrificed. The pair claimed cult members drank their victims’ blood and danced around with the babies’ skulls. At least seven schools were named, a swimming pool identified as a meeting place and ‘rituals’ were alleged to have been performed at a McDonald’s fast food restaurant. The children’s father, Mr Dearman, whose three-year relationship with Draper ended acrimoniously in 2007, was falsely said to be the leader of the cult, and teachers, police and even a priest to be among its more than 100 members. The judge said: ‘Many of those individuals are now living in fear because they have been identified on the internet as abusers of children and their contact details including telephone numbers, home and email addresses have been published. ‘Several of those implicated have received malicious, intimidating phone calls and emails at all hours of the day and night from all over the world. For example – “We’re coming for you. You paedo scum”.’ The two children, who are now in care, were repeatedly named in the internet campaign and films of them uploaded to the internet ‘with flagrant disregard for their welfare interests’. Mrs Justice Pauffley was asked to investigate by social services bosses in care proceedings brought by Barnet council after the two children were said to be at the centre of the cult’s abuse. But the judge said they were in fact forced by Draper and Christie to ‘provide concocted accounts of horrific events’ in filmed mobile phone recordings and to lie to police when interviewed after the allegations were brought to the attention of officers in September last year. Draper, who is believed to have fled abroad, is wanted for questioning by police over the false allegations . She ruled that the youngsters' 'fantasy' accounts of abuse stemmed from 'relentless emotional and psychological pressure' by Draper and Christie, who beat them into concocting stories. In the online video clips the children falsely accused their father of leading the cult - but later confessed to police that they had been forced to lie. In a damning 22-page judgment, High Court judge Mrs Justice Pauffley ruled that the children had been 'tortured' and 'brainwashed' by Draper and Christie. Pictures emerged last week of both yoga teacher Draper and Christie, who has a criminal record for violence, dishonesty and drugs offences, cavorting semi-naked in a cannabis field. Tests on Draper's son and daughter, aged eight and nine, showed they had both ingested cannabis in the months before being into taken care. Police are also hunting Sabine McNeill, a supporter of Draper, for alleged harassment. But even after last week's judgment, Draper made another video 'witness statement' on March 21 which she posted online, repeating false claims of 'rape, sodomy, murder and cannibalism' against exonerated individuals. As a result of the judge's findings and the material that continues to be published online, police have launched two investigations. Met detectives in Camden and Barnet are investigating the alleged harassment of the parents and school pupils. In a group email to the parents on March 24, police said of Draper and McNeill: 'Once found, they will be arrested and questioned.' The Met's Child Abuse Investigation Team based at Barnet is also investigating Draper and Christie. Tests on Draper's children showed they had ingested cannabis in the months before being taken into care . A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Following the ruling made by the High Court and comments made by the judge, officers are investigating whether any offences of child abuse have taken place. 'We would advise members of the public not to forward or share material on the internet that they believe is related to this enquiry. 'No arrests have been made at this time. Enquiries are ongoing.' Police attempted to arrest Draper on February 12 but were denied entry to her Hampstead home and three people escaped out of a back window. In her March 21 video, Draper, who is originally from the city of Rostov in southern Russia, says she was 'driven out of the UK under threat of kidnap or worse' and accuses Mrs Justice Pauffley of 'treason'. Christie, who was recently cautioned by police for assaulting his own adolescent son, briefly appeared outside the Royal Courts of Justice on February 17 but did not take part in the court case. Their supporters  continue to target the school and church attached to it. On Sunday a mob screamed 'paedophiles' at parishioners attending morning service. One woman who had her name, address, contact details and the name of her child posted online, said: 'This is a living nightmare without end. 'It really does beggar belief and adds insult to injury that even after the detailed court judgment Draper still has the audacity to be fuelling the fire by repeating false allegations against us all. 'There are more and more vigilantes coming on board instead of this dying down. 'We have all had abusive telephone calls and emails accusing us of 'killing babies' and being 'paedophile scum'. 'I was given a panic alarm by the police six or seven weeks ago and am enquiring about a fire-proof letterbox. 'We are having to be very aware of who is hanging around the school and our houses. 'The thing that we are most angry about is that our children's details have been published online. 'The irony is that her children are now safe in care while ours are at risk due to the actions of her and her followers.' Mr Dearman said that his reputation had been 'shattered' and called for tougher penalties against those who harass others online. He said: 'Currently, the criminal law is inadequate and disproportionate to the harm that has been caused. 'The criminal law needs to be extended to include sufficient scope for arresting and dealing with offenders who subject others to the abuse, indignity and humiliation of material such as has been uploaded in this case.' In a statement, the school said: 'This has been a distressing and difficult time for all of us at Christ Church Primary School. 'All members of the staff team continue to feel deep concern for the children at the centre of this very complex situation and sincerely hope they will go on to have every opportunity and success in the future.'","Judge found mother forced children to lie about sexual abuse and torture .

"The beginning of Major League Soccer's 20th season cannot come quickly enough for its newest, and arguably most highly anticipated, member. Ever since Manchester City announced that NYCFC would help form the American branch of the all-encompassing City Football Group (CFG) empire, huge doubts of skepticism have rained over the Big Apple and beyond. When someone like Sheikh Mansour, whose personal wealth stretches towards £20billion, becomes involved with a sporting venture it's natural to assume huge swathes of spending will swiftly follow. David Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday for New York City . New York City make their mark off the pitch with stellar signings and aggressive advertising to sell seats . After all, there is no institution on planet football which has the kind of structure CFG have attempted to build. The Yokohama F-Marinos were purchased last May while Melbourne City are enjoying the fruits of their Abu Dhabi association. NYCFC manager Jason Kreis and his squad enjoyed time rubbing shoulders and tapping into Manuel Pellegrini's knowledge last month. A simply priceless opportunity not afforded to others. Yet MLS doesn't operate like the Barclays Premier League, or anywhere else for that matter. The Sheik's incredible £1.2b investment in Manchester will not be replicated here. With strict, and at times mind-numbingly convoluted, rules ensuring spending doesn't exceed strict guidelines, NYCFC haven't been able to scour the world and bring a bucket load of superstars to Manhattan. Kreis was swiftly brought in by former City midfielder Claudio Reyna who is now the club's sporting director. Forty-two-year-old Kreis is highly rated in the US following an impressive seven year-spell with Real Salt Lake City where he won the MLS Cup in 2009. With the franchise being based in New York City, a place where the biggest names come to play, the money men in the Middle East were acutely aware just how important it was to bring excitement to the table. NYCFC manager Jason Kreis and his squad rubbed shoulders with Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City . NYCFC start their season on Sunday in front of a 60,000 crowd against fellow new franchise Orlando City . Putting bums on seats was vital - a view not shared by the New York Red Bulls. Star men Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill have not been replaced with faith placed in younger, hungrier players. The natives at the Red Bull Arena are far from happy. NYCFC though knew big names had to arrive especially at the inception with a temporary home at Yankee's Stadium in the Bronx not the ideal base to spend the first three years. A soccer specific stadium is in the pipeline – yet, as David Beckham is finding out in Miami, locating real estate for sporting venues in major US cities is anything but straightforward. So in came David Villa and, protractedly, Frank Lampard. Both stellar signings tap into the fervent, cosmopolitan football fanbase here. Villa ticks all the boxes for the Spanish speaking fans who pack the bars when Barcelona and Real Madrid strut their stuff in La Liga. Providing the 33-year-old steers clear of injury, it would be a shock if the former Barcelona forward doesn't get 20 goals or more. The slow paced, pretty much Championship standard of MLS will ensure a player of his class will provide defences with more than their fair share of nightmares. Expect him to drop deep, yet still cause all manner of problems in Kreis' preferred diamond formation. Frank Lampard poses with the Manhattan skyline behind him after his introduction as a New York City player . Villa and Lampard (pictured) have helped sell seats and season tickets as the MLS prepares to get going . Orlando City tweeted this about how Lampard won't be there and wrote: 'Sorry, Frank - we're sold out' Lampard too will have fun even if his signing was woefully handled by all concerned. New Yorkers are not used to being forced to settle for second best. And they wasted no time in showing their discontent. With the former Chelsea midfielder's name plastered all over billboards along with Villa, his arrival was the trigger which helped secure 14,000 season tickets sales. Naturally when news broke of his decision to stay in the Premier League until the end of the season, there was anger. And understandably so. City hoodwinked MLS commissioner Don Garber who, for someone who rules with such autonomy, was shown to be a touch naive throughout the whole 'will he, won't he' saga which always looked like having an outcome which wouldn't benefit New York. The fury, though, also indicated there are people who already care. When kick-off arrives on Sunday at a sell-out 60,000 in Orlando, Lampard won't be on their minds . Lampard was a major signing for NYCFC but will not play on Sunday as he remains with Manchester City . Yet when kick-off arrives on Sunday at a sell-out 60,000 againt fellow new franchise Orlando City, Lampard won't be at the forefront of anyone's thoughts. With US midfielder Mix Diskerud signing from Rosenbourg, Kreis is building a strong core while a contingent from South America and Europe add flair excitement - and something of the unknown. 'We have players who want to play, who like to play one and two touch and excite the crowd, ' said  24-year-old Diskerud, who was part of Jurgen Klinsmann's World Cup squad last summer. 'I definitely think that we are starting history here.' With the Red Bulls based in New Jersey – a minimum 30-minute train ride away from Manhattan – NYCFC have advertised aggressively to make their mark. Brazilian star Kaka will play for the new MLS franchise Orlando City, who NYCFC face on Sunday . Community projects have flourished for the past two years following the creation of the City soccer schools in Harlem while the tie-in with the New York Yankees – one of the most famous and iconic sporting brands in the world – should not be underestimated. Building a team which will be competitive won't be easy. Cohesion takes time. Yet if the honeymoon period stretches over a few victories, who knows where the feel good factor could take City's latest potshot at glory. An indelible mark has already been made off the pitch. Now's the time to start producing on it. Kaka - Orlando City SC . The Brazilian won the Ballon d’Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass. Frank Lampard – New York City FC . One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City. Steven Gerrard – LA Galaxy . The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane. David Villa - New York City FC . Villa became New York City’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York’s goals in their debut season. Bradley Wright-Phillips - New York Red Bulls . Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term.","New York City's MLS campaign begins on Sunday against Orlando City .

"A British tourist has been stranded in a Spanish hospital for 11 days because there were no available NHS beds available in the UK. Retired Chris Carr, 62, from Melksham, Wiltshire, was visiting Benidorm as part of a four-month caravan trip with his wife Sally, 59, when he was rushed to hospital with severe stomach pains. Spanish doctors found he is suffering from a diaphragmatic hernia which is causing a huge twist in his stomach, and said he needed an operation in the UK where he would get the necessary post-operative care. Chris Carr (pictured) was visiting Benidorm as part of a four-month caravan trip with his wife when he was rushed to hospital with severe stomach pains and told he needed an operation . But when his medical insurance company rang three hospitals near his home they were told there were no free beds. The couple's concerned friends rallied round and launched a campaign, putting pressure on the hospitals and getting support from their local MP. Mr Carr, who is still currently in Spain, has finally been offered a bed at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, Somerset, and is due to fly home tomorrow. But after 11 days of not knowing, Mrs Carr, a retired NHS midwife, said: 'I feel extremely angry - I was furious when we were told about there being no beds. Mr Carr was told by doctors he needed an operation in the UK where he would get post-operative care . Mr Carr's insurers phoned three hospitals near his home: Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bath's Royal United Hospital (pictured) and Swindon's Great Western Hospital - but all said there were no beds available for him . 'We've both worked hard all our lives and paid our taxes. 'Chris worked at the university for 35 years or more and I was a midwife for the NHS for 40 years. 'We've paid our taxes all this time and then for this to happen - I was so frustrated.' Speaking from Spain, she added: 'We had all the proper insurance - which isn't cheap - so it should have been seamless all the way through. 'But while the care here has been brilliant, it is back in the UK where there has been all the trouble.' He is suffering from a diaphragmatic hernia which is causing a huge and painful twist in his stomach . Former university IT worker Mr Carr travelled to Spain with his wife as part of a four-month group trip with the Camping and Caravanning Club in January. He began to feel unwell on February 14 after a meal out and after suffering extreme vomiting went to Hospital Marina Baixa, where he was diagnosed with food poisoning. He returned to his caravan with tablets but when his stomach swelled to four times its normal size he returned and was instantly seen by worried doctors. They diagnosed the hernia on his diaphragm which had caused his stomach to swell and twist, leaving him in agony. Doctors told the Carrs he needed an operation to remove part - if not all - of his stomach and due to potential left-over damage and the need for top-class post-operative care, the operation should happen in the UK. Mrs Carr said the insurers who work with the Camping and Caravanning Club phoned three hospitals near his home - Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bath's Royal United Hospital and Swindon's Great Western Hospital - but all said there were no beds free. 'We couldn't believe it,' said Mrs Carr. 'Bristol said no, Bath said no, Swindon said no. 'They said they had a duty of care to the patients they already had, and there were no beds anyway. We couldn't believe it. 'There was talk of just flying back and dumping ourselves in the nearest A and E, but we would effectively then be health tourists in our own country, and that didn't seem right.' When Mr Carr's insurance company rang hospitals near his home they were told there were no free beds . Friends and family launched the Get Chris Home campaign on Sunday, urging hospitals to change their mind and recruiting the support of Chippenham MP Duncan Hames. Yesterday Mrs Carr received a call from insurers to say Bath's RUH had now changed its mind and Mr Carr is due to fly home tomorrow via air ambulance for his operation. Mrs Carr said: 'It is thanks to the support of our friends and we are so relieved.' Speaking from his hospital bed in Benidorm today Mr Carr said he felt abandoned by his own country. He said: 'It is sad and disappointing that this has happened, the fact that your own country won't help you. 'It is a horrible, horrible situation to be in.' 'To have to resort to a social media campaign and involve your MP - it's not something we thought we would have to do. 'It's quite upsetting. The nurses here have said to us that they thought our country was rich - they can't believe it.' Mr Carr's travel insurers Aria Assistance called in medical company Intana to try and help find a hospital bed in England. An Intana spokeswoman said their assistance team spoke with Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bath's Royal United Hospital and Swindon's Great Western Hospital. She said: 'In arranging Mr Carr's repatriation to the UK we have been in dialogue with a number of treating hospitals within the region to ensure his admission to the appropriate facility for his medical needs. 'As Mr Carr's condition was subject to a degree of change during this time we experienced some difficulty in ascertaining which of these hospitals was able to accept Mr Carr based on the level of specialist care he was likely to require. 'We will never undertake any type of repatriation without having the patient's admission to the correct medical facility arranged and confirmed. Mr Carr in the Benidorm hospital where he has stayed for the last 11 days - he will return to the UK tomorrow . 'As with most medical conditions, Mr Carr's condition has evolved during this time and yesterday we received confirmation from one of these hospitals that, based on his current condition, they would be able to administer his medical treatment. 'During this time we have been in regular contact with the Carr family to keep them abreast of the situation.' But all three hospitals have today denied speaking to anybody about Mr Carr. The Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Our records show that we have not been contacted by any hospital in Spain relating to a patient repatriation.' The University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We will always try to accommodate patients who fall ill abroad as best we can and consider each case on an individual basis. 'We have checked our records, and to the best of our knowledge we have not had any contact from Mr Carr or his insurance company.' The Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We had no record of being contacted with regard to admitting Mr Christopher Carr for treatment here. 'The Trust regularly receives repatriation requests for which we have clear processes in place; once the details of who, when and where are received, we plan for their arrival in the same way that we would for any other hospital admission. 'We have now received Mr Carr's referral for treatment and we are preparing for his arrival.'","Chris Carr, 62, was taken to hospital in Benidorm with stomach pains .

"Nigel Farage today claimed mass immigration had left parents too uneasy to let their children play in the street - as he appeared shift Ukip policy by backing a cap on numbers. The Ukip leader used an election campaign launch beneath the White Cliffs of Dover to demand that net migration be cut to 30,000. It comes less than four weeks after he insisted he would not set 'caps or targets' for controlling Britain's borders. Ukip leader Nick Clegg  used an election campaign launch beneath the White Cliffs of Dover to demand that net migration be cut to 30,000 . Ukip claims the current system is 'unsustainable, unethical and unfair' and calls for more high-skilled workers and people from the Commonwealth to be allowed into Britain. The policy depends on Britain leaving the European Union, with polls showing support for staying in is rising. Unveiling a new poster in Kent today, Mr Farage said he wanted immigration reduced to roughly the levels seen between 1950 and 2000. Mr Farage said: ‘I want to live in a community where our kids play football in the streets of an evening and live in a society that is at ease with itself. And I sense over the last decade or more we are not at ease.’ 'If we went to virtually every town up eastern England and spoke to people about how they felt their town or city had changed for the last 10 to 15 years, there is a deep level of discomfort. 'Because if you have immigration at these sort of levels, integration doesn't happen.' David Cameron promised to to cut net migration below 100,000, but latest figures show that in the year to September the number reached almost 300,000. Speaking in the car park of the Coastguard pub in St Margaret's Bay, near Dover, Mr Farage said: 'When Cameron made that promise he was being wilfully dishonest because he knew the truth and I think now the British public five years on know the truth - that you actually cannot have an immigration policy, you can't set targets of any kind at all, you can't attempt to control who comes into Britain, all the while you're members of European Union.'

David Cameron promised to to cut net migration below 100,000, but latest figures show that in the year to September the number reached almost 300,000 . Ukip's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe has repeatedly promised a cap on immigration . Steven Woolfe, September 26: 'Within the points based system Ukip commits to bringing UK net employment migration down to 50,000 people a year' Steven Woolfe, October 23: 'I promised to cap migration to 50,000 a year' Steven Woolfe, February 26: 'We will set a cap on the number of people permitted to work and reside in the UK by introducing a fairer, and more transparent points based system ensuring we get the skilled immigrants we need and in numbers that the economy can manage.' Nigel Farage, March 4 :'I'm not putting caps or targets ... you need to have more flexibility than that.' Nigel Farage March 31: 'A return to normality, a return to about a net 30,000 people a year coming into this country.' Asked what sort of immigration levels he would like to see, Mr Farage said: 'A return to normality, a return to about a net 30,000 people a year coming into this country. 'I'm saying a net level of about 30,000 a year is roughly what we had for 50 years from 1950 almost until the turn of the century. It was a level at which the country was comfortable and that integration was possible and it didn't, crucially, compress the wages, push down the wages of ordinary people.' Ukip's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe had promised a cap, declaring last month: 'We will set a cap on the number of people permitted to work and reside in the UK by introducing a fairer.' At last year's party conference, he announced: 'Ukip commits to bringing UK net employment migration down to 50,000 people a year.' But earlier this month Mr Farage ditched the idea, declaring: 'I'm not putting caps or targets ... you need to have more flexibility than that.' Charlie Elphicke, who is standing for re-election as the Tory MP in Dover, said: 'All we've seen from Ukip on immigration is chaos and confusion: one minute there's a cap, then there's not. Mark Reckless says certain migrants should be repatriated, then Farage says they're welcome to stay. 'The bottom line is that a vote for Ukip puts Ed Miliband one step closer to Downing Street via the back door – and then there will be no action on immigration.'

Mr Farage claimed the figure of 30,000 represented a 'return to normality', when net immigration was somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000. But the Ukip leader said that if Britain pulled out of the European Union after a referendum, those levels could be achieved within the next five years. He said: 'We have to have a referendum first. 'If we had a referendum at the end of this year and within two years, all the details (of withdrawing from the EU), I mean it could take a year. 'There is absolutely no reason why midway through this parliament we couldn't return to normality.' But despite highlighting numbers he would like to see, Mr Farage claimed the immigration debate was 'devalued' by mentioning figures and targets. 'It is by putting out figures that this whole debate was devalued five years ago,' he said. He claimed that integration has been made impossible by the numbers coming in as he called for a ban on non-English speakers being allowed into the country. Asked if all immigrants should be able to speak English, he said: 'Yes, I do. 'There's no doubt, if you talk to Kent Police or Kent hospitals about translation services, it's a cost they could do without.'","Ukip leader ruled out a target for net migration at policy launch this month .
Now he says he would like roughly the levels seen between 1950 and 2000 .

"He revolutionised how we clean our homes but now Sir James Dyson is hoping to boost the battery life of our smartphones, cars and - of course - our vacuum cleaners. The 67-year-old inventor and entrepreneur has invested $15 million (£10 million) in Michigan-based battery experts Sakti3. The company has developed a range of 'solid-state' batteries (SSBs) that store 50 per cent more energy than current models and will make our favourite gadgets  smaller and safer. Scroll down for video . Dyson inventor Sir James Dyson has invested $15 million (£10 million) in Michigan-based Sakti3. The firm has developed a solid-state battery capable of storing double the amount of power as traditional lithium-ion models. The batteries could feature in Dyson's cordless cleaners as well as phones and other gadgets . It is the first investment Sir James has made outside of his bagless vacuum business. Batteries have three main components - the anode, cathode and electrolyte. This electrolyte is typically a chemical that separates the anode and cathode and moves the flow of electrical charge between the two. The majority of batteries found in phones, electric cars and Sir James' range of cordless vacuums use lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology. Lithium-ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte and because lithium is a highly-reactive element it stores a large amount of energy. But this liquid electrolyte is often flammable and has been blamed for batteries bursting into flames when overheated, for example. Due to the safety implications of placing flammable liquids in electric cars, too, many of these auto-based batteries have added safety features making them expensive to run. Lithium-ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte but this liquid electrolyte is  flammable. Sakti3's SSBs are based on the same Li-ion technology but replace the liquid electrolyte with a coating of non-flammable metal. This makes them safer, smaller, (pictured) more robust and mean they can be used at higher temperatures . In particular the battery has to be cooled down and can never fully charge or discharge resulting in wasted capacity. Batteries have three main components - the anode, cathode and electrolyte. This electrolyte is typically a chemical that separates the anode and cathode and moves the flow of electrical charge between the two.

But this liquid electrolyte is often flammable and has been blamed for batteries bursting into flames when overheated, for example. Sakti3's SSBs are based on the same Li-ion technology but replace the liquid electrolyte with a coating of non-flammable metal. This not only makes them safer for both the consumer and the environment, but they are also more robust - liquid electrolytes can be easily damaged - and can be used at higher temperatures.

This not only makes them safer for both the consumer and the environment, they are more robust - liquid electrolytes can be easily damaged - and can be used at higher temperatures. Li-ion are extremely sensitive to high temperatures and it can cause them to degrade faster, for instance. Sakti3 has already designed an SSB with an energy density rating - the amount of energy stored it can store - of 1,100 watt hours per litre. This is said to be 50 per cent higher than than current lithium-ion batteries. The firm has also demonstrated its prototype can survive more charge-discharge cycles than traditional Li-ion batteries which typically  last two or three years - whether they are used or not. Other companies including Toyota are also working on developing similar technology. Sir James' investment in Sakti3 is part of a larger $20miillion (£13 million) round of investment that will see the technology sold commercially and added to Dyson products. This would include the firm's latest cordless V6 Fluffy designed to work with wooden floorboards, ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring. Sir James said: 'Sakti3 has achieved leaps in performance which current battery technology simply can't. It's these fundamental technologies - batteries, motors - that allow machines to work properly. 'The Sakti3 team has amazing ambitions, and their platform offers the potential for exponential performance gains that will supercharge the Dyson machines we know today.'

"A pet owner who kept her dogs in cages so filthy that one of the pets had to be put down has been banned from keeping animals for life. Caroline Monk, 45, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, left two dogs in 'dreadful' and 'disgusting' conditions, which smelled so bad they nearly made investigators vomit, a court heard. Northampton Magistrates Court were told one dog, a one-year-old Mastiff called Nash, was kept in a small cage that had not been cleaned for several weeks and had no access to food and water. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Caroline Monk, 45, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, left two dogs in 'dreadful' and 'disgusting' conditions, which smelled so bad they nearly made investigators vomit, a court heard . The pet owner kept her dogs in cages so filthy that one of the pets had to be put down. She has now been banned from keeping animals for life . A statement by Monk, read out in court, said that the had only left the dogs for 'four days' because she had recently suffered a fit and was 'completely out of it' Floors in the flat that were covered in 'compacted faeces' and urine had attracted 'beetles and flies' and were strewn with hazards, including bottles of bleach. The RSPCA were called to the property after neighbours reported hearing dogs inside, even though the owner was rarely there. The court heard Nash, who was found underweight and with infected ulcers on his body, had to later be put down. Kevin McCole, prosecuting on behalf of the animal welfare charity, said: 'The inspector was horrified by what she saw and the smell was so overpowering that she nearly vomited. The court heard one dog, Nash, who was found underweight and with infected ulcers on his body, had to later be put down . 'The dog would have felt pain from hunger, thirst and his skin conditions, and would have continued to suffer organ failure.' The other dog, a five-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Millie, was found overweight and has recovered since being taken treated by the RSPCA. On Tuesday Monk pleaded guilty to charges of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and breaching her duty of responsibility to ensure animal welfare. She was banned for life from keeping any animals and was ordered to pay a £300 contribution to the £500 court costs and a victim surcharge of £60. She was also placed under a six-month supervision order. Tony Davies, defending, said the treatment of both dogs had been 'dreadful' and 'disgusting' but added she could not be held responsible because of her medical condition. Floors in the flat that were covered in 'compacted faeces' and urine had attracted 'beetles and flies' and were strewn with hazards, including bottles of bleach . He said: 'This was not an offence of volition, but of omission and a lack of foresight. 'She was not acting out of a cavalier attitude, but an impaired ability to care for her pets, and we cannot judge her by the same standards as the rest of us.'

"Six months ago Kobane was a city in panic as the Kurds were desperately fleeing ISIS forces as they bared down on the border town, fearful that they would be slaughtered like the Yazidis before them if the settlement was overrun by the fanatical jihadis. Now the terrorists have gone, beaten back into the desert by Kurdish forces and coalition airstrikes, and the residents can return to their 'saved' city. But, as these images show, not a lot of the home they remember is still standing. Tanks rust in the streets, buildings reduced to mere shells after bombings serve as temporary shelter for those who survived, while a little girl is reduced to lighting a fire underneath a piece of rubble in the street to keep warm. A sign which once proudly displayed the town's name now stands riddled with bullet holes, like the few buildings left standing around it. The battle for Kobane was the fiercest and most bloody battle of the war against ISIS to date, and represented the group's first major defeat after months of virtually unopposed victories which saw them take swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. At one point things looked so bad that Turkish President Recep Erdogan declared the city was only hours away from completely falling into ISIS' bloodstained hands. Victory was secured at the end of January after the last ISIS fighters were forced from the city's suburbs and into their strongholds along the Euphrates River. Civilians forced to flee across the border into Turkey are now returning home. Scroll down for video . Shell: The rusting remains of a tank sit along the side of a street in the border town of Kobane, just over a month after ISIS fighters were forced out of the city after months of fighting with Kurdish ground forces and bombing runs by coalition warplanes . Ruined: Virtually none of the buildings in the city were left untouched by the battle, which raged for six months, and marks the bloodiest and fiercest fight in the war against ISIS to date. The residents who survived or have returned are now faced with living in conditions like this . Pride: A Syrian Kurdish woman sweeps rubble out of what is left of her home after ISIS fighters fled the city of Kobane. The fighting here lasted for four months, and has left the city in ruins . Making the most of it: Just six months ago this Kurdish boy, along with thousands of other Kurds, were desperately fleeing Kobane, fearful they would be slaughtered if the city was overrun. Now they can return, but little of their previous home remains . Desperate: With little or no access to water and electricity, this young girl is forced to light a fire underneath rubble in the street to keep warm and cook her food . Shattered: A Kobane sign riddled with bullets and shrapnel marks mirrors the condition of the few building that are left standing around it . Homecoming: After four months of fierce fighting the Kurds, who were facing near extinction at the hands of ISIS, are able to return to what is left of their home town and begin rebuilding it . Flattened: A girl rides in a trailer being towed into Kobane by tractor as rows of levelled houses can be seen in the background. The city was heavily bombed by coalition warplanes during six months of fighting in order to dislodge ISIS troops taking cover there . All gone: A Kurdish man looks out over the destroyed city of Kobane from the balcony of his bullet-riddled home, just over a month after the last ISIS fighters fled for their strongholds along the Euphrates River . Littered: A woman stands among the ruins of her old home, as the streets around her are scattered with rubble, clothes, and ruined cars . Destroyed: The remains of another tank are testament to the ferocity of the fighting in Kobane. Against all the odds, Kurdish forces which were at one point pinned in the centre of the city, managed to fight their way out and claim victory . Nothing left: A man holding a rolled up cigarette and clutching a glass of drink stands among the ruins of his house.

"Sophie Burgess, 19, died just 48 hours after giving birth to twins having contracted septicaemia . A teenage mother has died after giving birth to twins eight weeks before their due date without ever getting the chance to hold her newborn babies. Sophie Burgess gave birth to Evie and Oliver at Wolverhampton New Cross Hospital after suffering cramps. The 19-year-old, who was unconscious when the babies were born, contracted septicaemia and was rushed into a critical care unit. She died 48 hours later having never met the babies. Her family have since paid tribute to the teenager who 'could not wait' to become a mother. On March 11, Miss Burgess from Telford, Shropshire, rushed to Princes Royal Hospital with her partner Alex Carter, 23, after experiencing cramps. She was transferred to the hospital in Wolverhampton where she gave birth to Oliver naturally. Doctors were then forced to perform an emergency Caesarean section to safely deliver Evie, with Miss Burgess unconscious throughout the procedure. Miss Burgess was moved to the hospital's critical care unit but died 48 hours later. Speaking of his younger sister, who worked as a care worker,  Miss Burgess's brother, Craig, said: 'It is so sad that my sister never got to hold her children but Alex has not left their side since. Miss Burgess gave birth to Oliver naturally before doctors were forced to perform an emergency Caesearean to safely deliver Evie . 'They are out of the incubators now and both seem to be doing well. They are amazing and Sophie would have been so proud of them. 'I honestly cannot begin to describe Sophie, she was full of life. She could not wait to become a mother and as a family we will make sure her babies never forget her. They are her legacy now.' Miss Burgess's mother, Mandy, said the family did not know what had caused the 19-year-old to contract septicaemia which is poisoning in the blood. 'Sophie contracted septicaemia after giving birth to her twins, the reason behind this is still unknown but the hospital have been conducting their own investigations. 'We are now planning Sophie's funeral.' She had been living at the family's Telford home with her partner throughout her pregnancy. The babies weighed just 3lbs each once delivered eight weeks early in Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital . The babies' father, Alex Carter, has 'not left their side' since their mother's death last week. They remain in incubators . 'Sophie and her boyfriend, Alex, lived at home with me while she was pregnant and we will be helping him alongside his family to bring up the twins when they get out of hospital.' 'He has been an exceptional dad to Oliverand Evie so far.' A friend of the family has set up an online donations page to contribute towards the twins' upbringing as doctors at Wolverhampton New Cross Hospital investigate what caused the young mother to take ill. Ria Norris, who grew up with Miss Burgess, said she would have been 'a fantastic mother'. 'She was so prepared for it. With her being young people might think they wouldn't t have been but both she and Alex really were.' Friends and relatives said Miss Burgess 'could not wait to become a mother' After being told that she might struggle to conceive children when she was younger, the care worker was 'over the moon' to learn she was pregnant last year, she added. 'She was absolutely elated. The whole family was,' said Mrs Norris, 32. 'Sophie loved being pregnant, she absolutely thrived on it. I think having been told that it might be difficult she just totally embraced it.' 'The twins are the first grandchildren in the family so it's very special.' Mr Carter was equally excited having been with Miss Burgess for years, she said. 'Alex was over the moon. He hasn't left the babies' side since they were born either. 'It's amazing when in a situation where he might have some emotions, he doesn't have any resentment towards anyone. 'He is amazing.' New Cross Hospital has launched an investigation into what may have caused Miss Burgess to contract septicaemia. Jonathan Odum, medical director at the hospital, said staff had been 'deeply affected' by the young mother's death. 'Sadly Sophie developed a severe illness following the birth of her twins from which she deteriorated very quickly,' he said. 'Despite the best efforts of the medical and nursing staff looking after her, she passed away on a critical care unit a few hours later. 'The staff in the maternity department and the critical care unit have been deeply affected by Sophie's death and the trust would like to pass on it's sympathy and condolences to her family and friends. 'An investigation into the cause of her death is currently being carried out.' To visit the gofundme page set up in Miss Burgess's memory click here.

"For a bullock with two heads, he's mighty healthy. A cattle saleyard in Mareeba, North Queensland, hosted an unusual sight on Tuesday when a livestock agent arrived to hawk a two-faced cow. Its second face, mounted on top of its first, had one eye, a single tooth and functional nostrils, according to the saleyard. It was in 'great condition'. 'Mate, he's as fat as a fool!' said Elders selling agent Mark Peters, who witnessed the animal's purchase yesterday. Scroll down for video . Two faces! This unnamed two-face bullock was successfully sold at Mareeba Saleyards by Queensland Rural selling agent Jack Shepherd on Tuesday . According to the saleyard staff, the second face (attached on top of the first face above) had one eye, one tooth, working nostrils and was in 'great condition' Mr Peters said: 'It was an absolute prime condition animal, he just had two faces'. Unsurprisingly, the two-faced animal attracted curious glances at the saleyards. 'It received a fair amount of attention,' said Queensland Rural livestock agent Jack 'Jacko' Shephard, who sold the bullock. Mr Shephard said he had not seen another two-faced cow during his 17 years on the job, although he had seen other abnormalities. The 440kg animal successfully sold for $537AUD, or 122 cents per kilo.

"Any TV fan worth their salt will be familiar with EastEnders' character Zoe Slater's dramatic wail: 'You ain't my mother!' And now the iconic 2001 scene where feisty character Kat Slater revealed that she was, in fact, Zoe's mother, has been named the greatest soap storyline of all time. In a poll of 2,000 soap fans, the scene - in which Kat's confession that Zoe was conceived after Kat was abused by her uncle Harry - topped the list of favourite tears, tantrums and cliffhangers. Scroll down for video . The Eastenders' storyline revealing Kat Slater to be the mother of her 'younger sister' Zoe has been named the greatest British soap narrative of all time . The iconic scene sees Zoe shout: 'You ain't my mother!' in the street before Kat screeches back: 'Yes I am!' The famous street row between the pair, where Zoe yells 'You ain't my mother' at Kat before finding out the truth even featured in Australian soap Neighbours' recent tribute video to celebrate EastEnders' 30th anniversary. Richard Hillman driving the Platt family into the canal in Coronation Street came second in the poll, followed by Hayley Cropper's courageous cancer battle and subsequent death in 2014. EastEnders bad guy Dirty Den getting shot in 1989 and the Coronation Street tram crash completed the top five. The episode was given the top spot in a poll of 2,000 soap fans on their favourite storylines . As well as old favourites, the recent Eastenders cliffhanger of 'who killed Lucy Beale' also made it in to the top ten, taking the number seven slot. A spokesman for survey site OnePoll.com, which commissioned the research, said that the winning storyline thoroughly deserved its title. 'The Kat and Zoe storyline is something most people are familiar with, even if they aren't an avid EastEnders fan. The tear-jerking episode of Coronation Street where Hayley Cropper died earned third place on the list . The recent EastEnders storyline 'Who Killed Lucy Beale' earned seventh place on the list after attracting millions of viewers in a week of live episodes to celebrate the soap's 30th anniversary . 'It had everything a great soap storyline needs - a blazing row, some tears and a huge shock just as the episode comes to a close.' He added that the reason that some of the older story lines had found their way into the top 50 was because they had a large impact on our lives. 'There have been many brilliant and gripping storylines over the years - whether they are tearjerkers like the moment Hayley died in Coronation Street or high drama like the live tram crash. 'Soaps are a huge part of our culture and these results show the storylines are remembered years after they are first screened.' In second place was Richard Hillman driving The Platts into a canal in a 2003 episode of Coronation Street . Sixth place in the poll went to the famous moment Dirty Den handed wife Angie divorce papers in the EastEnders' 1986 Christmas Day episode, followed by the London-based soap's huge 'Who Killed Lucy' story. After almost a year's worth of teases, the killer was finally revealed to be her half-brother Bobby during a week of live episodes during the EastEnders 30th anniversary celebration. Little Mo's domestic abuse storyline in EastEnders came eighth followed by Scott and Charlene's wedding in Neighbours and Deirdre Barlow being jailed for fraud in Coronation Street. Little Mo's domestic abuse story also stuck in viewers heads as the 2001 drama came eighth in the poll . Other storylines to feature in the top 20 include the whodunnit storyline 'Who Shot Phil' in EastEnders, after the hard-man was shot on his doorstep, Corrie's Tyrone suffering domestic abuse at the hands of partner Kirsty and Mike Baldwin dying in rival Ken Barlow's arms on the cobbles. The Emmerdale plane crash in 1993, the body under the patio in Brookside, Max and Stacey's affair in EastEnders and the famous love triangle between brothers Phil and Grant Mitchell and Grant's wife Sharon are also high on the list. More than half of the storylines featured in the poll were ones from EastEnders, including the long-running storyline of 'Who Shot Phil Mitchell' that was on our screens over 2000-2001 coming 11th in the poll . EastEnders features heavily in the top 50 with more than half the list made up of storylines from the soap. Old favourites such as Michelle Fowler falling pregnant with Dirty Den's baby as a teenager and Nick Cotton trying to kill mum Dot all feature alongside more recent storylines such as Dean Watt's attack on Linda. Brookside, which was last on our screens in 2003, also features several times with Nat and Georgia's incest and Beth and Margaret's lesbian kiss, which was seen as a ground-breaking storyline at the time it was aired. 1.

"A prison sentence at Eastern State Penitentiary not only separated you from the outside world - but all human contact. Built in 1829, it was the first jail to implement solitary confinement for every single inmate which is thought to have brought on mental illness. Even outside the tiny cells, guards would cover their heads with a hood so they remained in confinement even when they wandered through its stone halls. The prison, which closed its doors in 1971, is considered by many people as one of the most haunted buildings in America.

Chilling: Thousands of hardcore prisoners housed within these tiny cells in the Philadelphia would live alone, eat alone and even exercised alone in tiny individual yards . Chilling: The guards would even cover the inmates' heads with a hood when they left their cells so they could not see any of the others or map out the prison in their minds . Cruelty: And they allegedly subjected the prisoners to inhumane torture methods like the 'mad chair', where they would cut off prisoners' circulation - necessitating amputations . Notorious: The prison even housed feared prohibition-era gangster Al Capone whose luxurious room has been restored for tourists . King among prisoners: Capone spent most of his one year sentence in relative comfort and was allowed to furnish his cell with antiques, rugs, and oil paintings . Ghostly sightings: The prison closed down in 1971 and reopened as a museum in 1996, but tourists still report ghostly sightings . Strange presence: Those who believe in ghost stories say the trouble souls of the mistreated inmates still roam Eastern State's crumbling hallways . Home: The prison designer's ambitious mechanical innovations placed each prisoner had his or her own private cell, centrally heated, with running water, a flush toilet, and a skylight . Its crumbling stone walls, dark corridors and claustrophobia-inducing cells once housed thousands of hardcore criminals. The Philadelphia prison's 142-year history is steeped in controversy and cruelty and those who believe in ghost stories say the troubled souls of inmates still roam the abandoned halls. They were severely mistreated by the prison guards who found a number of sick ways to punish those who misbehaved. According to NPR, they would use a torture method called the 'water bath' where they would dunk the prisoner in water then hang them to dry in the cold outside until ice formed on the skin. They would also tie inmates so tightly in a device called 'the mad chair' that it would cut off circulation and necessitate amputations. And the worst offenders would be put in 'the hole', a pitch-black underground cell where they had no light, no human contact and little air. The solitary confinement system was eventually discarded when the prison became overcrowded but Eastern State is widely thought to have induced mental illness in many of its inhabitants. It housed infamous criminals like bank robber Willie Sutton and even Al Capone who headed a criminal syndicate illegally supplying alcohol during the prohibition in the early-1900s. Infamous: Housed inside great, stone walls - Eastern State was just as famous for its wagon-wheel design as it was for the cruelty inflicted on prisoners . Trapped: Prisoners at Eastern State were thought to have gone insane having been housed inside tiny cells with little light and air . Poltergeist: A man who helps maintain the building says he once walked into Cell Block 4 and felt an unknown force grab him so tight he could not move . Eerie atmosphere: Eastern State certainly has the appearance of a haunted building with its rusting walls and claustrophobia-inducing cells which once housed thousands of hardcore criminals . Blinded: To prevent distraction, knowledge of the building, and even mild interaction with guards, inmates were hooded whenever they were outside their cells . Torture: One of the punishments the guards used was called the 'water bath' where they would dunk inmates in water then hang them in the cold outside until ice formed on their skin . Punishment: And the worst offenders would be put in 'the hole', a pitch-black underground cell where they had no light, no human contact and little air . Cruel therapy: People who ran the prison believed that the criminals - living in total silence and left alone with  the ugliness of their crimes - would repent . Insanity: Critics say the exact opposite occurred and a life of isolation inside these strict, haunting walls drove many of them to madness . Too late: The solitary confinement system was eventually discarded but Eastern State is widely thought to have induced mental illness in many of its inhabitants . Since 1996 it has been a museum and Halloween attraction but visitors still report eerie sightings and noises from the once-notorious prison. Tourists claim there have been mysterious footsteps in the yard, the sound of pacing in empty cells and strange noises drifting through the ever-cold hallways. Cell Block 12 has become infamous for reports of chilling laughter and one guard tower sometimes appears to be occupied by a shadowy figure keeping watch over Eastern State. Gary Johnson, who helps maintain the crumbling old locks at the prison told NPR that he felt a force grip him so tight in Cell Block 4 that he was immobilised. He described a negative, horrible energy that exploded out of the cell and claims tormented faces appeared on the cell walls and one in particular took hold of him.","Prisoners at Eastern State Penitentiary were kept in solitary confinement which some say induced mental illness .

"An unemployed father-of-five raided his grandfather's life savings to feed his drug habit, leaving the 90-year-old with just £8.79 left in his bank account. Morbidly obese Steve Austin, of Croydon, systematically withdrew £2,500 from the account of his grandfather Stanley Taylor. Austin even demanded Mr Taylor, who had brought him up from the age of 12 , give him more cash after the bank was notified by what had happened and gave the 90-year-old a refund. Austin threatened the pensioner that, if he refused to hand over cash, he would not see his great-grandchildren. Steve Austin withdrew almost all of his grandfather's life savings, leaving him with just £8.79, Southwark Crown Court heard. Austin even demanded more cash when the bank refunded the 90-year-old's money . The 39-year-old was jailed for six months after he admitted one charge of fraud. A judge said he had 'abused' the trust of his family. Southwark Crown Court heard that Mr Taylor's health has deteriorated since the incident and he was struggling to cope with the break-up of his family caused by Austin's theft. The court heard that Austin had withdrawn the cash in £100 to £250 amounts between 1 October 2013 and 28 October that year. But Mr Taylor only discovered his life savings had almost disappeared when he went to Orpington town centre with his daughter and a bank statement showed his savings account now contained just £8.79. Both said the account had contained his life savings, which they thought amounted to £2,560.94. Tanya Roberts, prosecuting, told the court: ‘Mr Taylor and his daughter suspected that it was Steve Austin, his grandson, who had taken the money and the reason that was thought was because Mr Austin took money before. ‘They paid a visit to Mr Austin and he admitted to them he had taken his grandfather’s bank card and money and spent it on drugs.’ Austin then tried to persuade his grandfather not to report him to the police. The bank also organised a refund for the pensioner - creating further problems. Mr Taylor only realised his bank account had been almost emptied when he went to Orpington town centre to get a statement and found that the savings account contained just £8.79 - there had been more than £2,500 . Ms Roberts continued: ‘Mr Austin attempted to put pressure on his grandfather by asking him to hand over the money as he knew the bank had provided him with a refund.’ Laurence Imrie, defending Austin, said he turned to drugs after the death of his grandmother in 2012 and had intended to repay the stolen cash. ‘Mr Austin had been raised by the complainant, his grandfather, from the age of 12 after his parents had separated and his mother had engaged in a new relationship,' said Mr Imrie. ‘He was brought up effectively as a son.' Austin had cared for his grandmother during her illness until her death in 2012. Mr Recorder Gibson Grenfell QC said Austin had committed a ‘despicable form’ of fraud and ‘abused’ the trust of his family. He said: ‘You took, it seems, from your very ill grandfather’s bank account with the use of his bank card. He is an old man who is now near 91, you cleared out the bulk of his life savings.' The court was told that Austin's theft had had a ‘catastrophic’ effect on his grandfather who suffered a deterioration in health and is struggling to cope with the break-up of the family. ‘I also read that you have stopped access to his grandchildren and you have, since June 2014, been asking him for money and threatening him with not seeing his great-grandchildren if he refuses,’ said the judge. ‘Your good intentions that you claimed to have had were on any view totally worthless as you had no hope of returning the money.’ Austin, who walked into the court using two sticks, struggled to remain standing in the dock as he was sentenced and was permitted to sit down part-way through the judge’s remarks. He admitted the fraud charge and was also in breach of two suspended sentences at the time of offending for thefts dating back to 2011 and 2012. Austin was jailed for three months for stealing the cash and three months consecutively for breaching his suspended sentences.","Steve Austin systematically stole £2,500 from his grandfather's account .

"The first Obama administration official to address desertion charges filed against U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl said Wednesday night that trading five high-value Taliban leaders for his safe return was 'absolutely' the right thing to do. 'Was it worth it? Absolutely,' said Jen Psaki, the chief spokeswoman at the State Department. 'We have a commitment to our men and women serving overseas – or serving in our military – defending our national security every day, that we're going to do everything we can to bring them home if we can, and that's what we did in this case.' On Thursday aboard Air Force One, White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz backed her up, saying that President Barack Obama 'will not allow a member of the United States armed forces to be left behind.' 'Was it worth it? Absolutely,' said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki of the Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl prisoner swap . Bergdahl, shown before his handover to US troops in May 2014, was ransomed for five high-level Taliban leaders in a White House maneuver that has drawn criticism from members of Congress . Psaki spoke to Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly. She is scheduled to take over the job of White House communications director next month from Jen Palmieri, who will transition to a role with Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. 'You know, this is a commitment we've made, we've long made, we've made for decades,' said Psaki. Bringing Bergdahl home at any cost 'was an important message for this president to deliver to the American people,' Schultz added Thursday, 'but also to people all around the world, that the United States and their commander-in-chief stands squarely behind our men and women in uniform – and with the commitment we have made to not leave them behind.' He wouldn't, however, comment on the criminal charges facing Bergdahl. 'There's an ongoing military justice process that's underway and I don't want to say anything that might interfere with that investigation, or even leave anyone with the appearance of some sort of interference,' Schultz told reporters. 'But that is a process that will run its course as it should.' The Obama administration's ransom deal has come under new fire as Bergdahl's criminal charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice were read yesterday at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, a California Republican, said the charges of desertion and 'misbehavior before the enemy' were 'the exclamation point on the bad deal the Obama administration cut to free five terrorist killers in its rush to empty the prison at Guantanamo Bay.' 'TALIBAN FIVE': The terror leaders traded for Bergdahl were (top, from left): Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari; and (bottom from left): Mohammad A Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori . Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said President Barack Obama 'endangered our national security and broke the law when he chose to negotiate with terrorists and release hardened enemy combatants from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl – who many believed at the time was a deserter.' And Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe wrote in a scathing op-ed for Time magazine asking: 'Who will be held accountable for breaking the law regarding the release of prisoners from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba? Bowe Bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice . 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty': . Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.' It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case . MAXIMUM SENTENCE: 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place': . Article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' MAXIMUM SENTENCE: life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . 'In executing the transfer of five detainees from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Bergdahl, the president violated a law that requires him to notify Congress 30 days before any transfer of terrorists from the detention facility,' Inhofe wrote, 'and to explain how the threat posed by the terrorists has been substantially mitigated.' 'His failure to adhere to a law he signed places our nation’s security at great risk for the foreseeable future.' Obama himself has not addressed the Bergdahl issue since his charges were read on Wednesday. But he insisted in a June 2014 press conference that he had made the right decision. 'I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents,' the president said then, 'and that the American people understand that this is somebody's child and that we don't condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back.' Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban after leaving his post in June 2009 and held by members of the Haqqani network, an insurgent group tied to the Taliban that operates both in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Before disappearing, Bergdahl had expressed misgivings about the U.S. role in the war – as well as his own. Last May 31, Bergdahl was handed over to U.S. special forces in Afghanistan as part of an exchange for five Taliban commanders who were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The exchange set off a debate over whether the U.S. should have released the five Taliban members. Little is known about what the five have been doing in Qatar, where they are being monitored by the government. Some lawmakers have predicted that the five would return to the battlefield, and at least two have said they intend to. Bergdahl was charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy; the first carries up to five years in prison, the latter up to life. A conviction on either could strip him of his rank and all pay and earn him a dishonorable discharge. The 'misbehavior' charge is rare and typically reserved for shameful or cowardly conduct, said Daniel Conway, a military defense lawyer and the author of a forthcoming book on military crimes. Bergdahl, 28, won't face a death sentence, although the punishment is an option for prosecutors to pursue against deserters in wartime. But his case does raise the question of whether military prosecutors will lock away for life a man the U.S. gave up five imprisoned Taliban commanders to bring home. US Army Col. Daniel King addressed the news media about charges against Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl at Fort Bragg, NC on Wednesday, March 25, 2015, reading a one-page statement but not taking any questions . A death penalty case was likely a non-starter after all that had to be sacrificed to bring him home,  Jeffrey K. Walker, a St. John's University law professor, retired Air Force officer and former military lawyer told the Associated Press. President Obama said less than a week after he traded fiveTaliban fighters for Bowe Bergdahl that he would make 'no apologies' for the decision . In fact, his defense attorney might successfully argue he deserves leniency after years as a prisoner. 'That's pretty good mitigation evidence,' Walker said. 'It wouldn't surprise me at all if what he ended up with was a dishonorable discharge and no jail time.' Bergdahl's 'reintegration' when he returned to Fort Sam Houston in Texas suggests how difficult his life was in captivity. He was on a bland diet at first and did not initially have access to a television. He was gradually allowed to venture off the base to go to grocery stores, restaurants and shopping centers. He even had to readjust to the idea that he could control aspects of his life as simple as choosing when to eat, and what. However, the charges underscore the military's position that the hardship of his captivity doesn't outweigh the ramifications of leaving his post. Some members of his former unit have called for serious punishment, saying others risked their lives searching for him. 'The military's obviously a very rough job. ... But everybody else stayed with the oath and did what they signed up to do. And as a result of that, some didn't get to come home,' said Cody Full, 26, who served in Bergdahl's platoon. He said Bergdahl should be stripped of his pay and benefits and be dishonorably discharged . Michael Waddington, a military defense lawyer not involved with Bergdahl's case, said he expected a long prison sentence and wondered why the U.S. bothered to bring him back. 'The administration traded a known Taliban for this guy only to bring him back and put him in jail,' Waddington said. 'That seems to me like a waste of resources.' In an interview Wednesday with MSNBC, Bergdahl's attorney, Eugene Fidell, claimed the major general who conducted an investigation of the case before the charges were brought 'never mentioned' the misbehavior charge 'and I don't think he had it in mind, and I don't frankly know how it got on the charge sheet.' 'This is a matter that I anticipate we'll contest,' he said. Fidell said the desertion charge and the misbehavior charge 'are simply two ways of describing the same conduct, and I think it's unfortunate that someone got creative in drafting the charge sheet and figured out two ways to charge the same thing.' Conway said he wouldn't expect the Army to seek much prison time for Bergdahl because of his time as a Taliban captive, but officials needed to prosecute the case because a conviction means Bergdahl cannot collect special compensation as a prisoner of war. 'He did spend X number of years as a prisoner of the Taliban — that certainly mitigates the need for him to be locked up,' Conway said. 'But as a political matter, I don't think we can stomach the possibility that he deserted his post and could receive $300,000 in back pay for it.'","'Was it worth it?

"A Texas mother claims she and her 5-year-old daughter were shamed last weekend, when they went shopping for a suit for the little girl in Denison, Texas. Rachel Giordano and her daughter Maddie stopped by Martha's Miniatures on Saturday to get an Easter outfit when the tomboy little girl asked to try on a suit. Mrs Giordano told KTEN that when the shop clerk realized Maddie was a girl, she looked at them with a 'face of disgust'. Scroll down for video . Dressing herself: Texas mother of three Rachel Giordano (right)says her 5-year-old daughter Maddie (left) was discriminated against at a children's clothing store for wanting to buy a suit instead of a dress for Easter . Shamed: The mother and daughter were shopping at Martha's Miniatures in Denison, Texas on Saturday when one of the store clerks gave them a look of disgust and told Mrs Giordano not to indulge her daughter's tomboy tastes . 'She told me that I was promoting wrong behavior. That parent's should not let their children choose the way that they dress if it's cross-gendered,' Mrs Giordano said. Mrs Giordano decided to not give the store her business and walked out with her crying to child to J.C.Penney where they found a suit. Following the eye-opening encounter, Mrs Giordano wrote a negative post about the store on Facebook, leading many of her friends to give the store one-star review's on it's now deactivated Facebook page. But before the store's owners took down their Facebook, they wrote a response to Mrs Giordano's complaint, saying that she was a child abuser for letting her daughter decide how she wants to dress. Response: Following the incident, Mrs Giordano wrote a post on Facebook and many of her friends gave the shop a one-star rating. The shop responded by defending the reaction with the above response . Closed: Eventually, the shop took down their Facebook and now their website says they are temporarily closed for maintenance . 'This mother brought her three children. She asked if I had a size 5 boy's suit. I found a 6 and a 5. She tried the boys suits on the child and then told me neither suit fit the little girl. I was so shocked, that she asked for a boy's suit for the child. I asked her why she was encouraging this...This is child abuse from the mother.' Daily Mail Online's calls to Martha's Miniatures were not immediately returned on Tuesday. The store's website says that they are closed for maintenance and plan to re-open soon. The Giordano's experience at Martha's Miniatures comes a week after Indiana and Arkansas have passed legislation which allows businesses to cite their religious beliefs as a defense in potential lawsuits with customers. However, many pointed out that businesses could use the new law to discriminate and not serve homosexual customers. The new law in Indiana has sparked fury across the nation, and has been publicly criticized by celebrities, politicians and businessmen from Apple CEO Tim Cook to Ashton Kutcher. Indiana Governor Mike Pence says he will amend the law to clarify that businesses are not allowed to deny service.","Rachel Giordano was shopping with her 5-year-old daughter Maddie at Martha's Miniatures in Denison, Texas on Saturday .

"Nearly half of the Radio Rentals customers have been found to be on welfare payments, and they are not just renting household necessities. The ABC have reported that those who receive Centrelink payments made up half of Radio Rental's income last year. Of the $197 million of revenue they made, $90 million came from the bill-managing Centrelink service, Centrepay. Rental company Radio Rentals has been getting nealry half of its yearly revenue from Centrelink . Centrelink's service, Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service that helps to manage welfare funds . Of that $90 million in expenditure, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, smart phones, sound systems and other home theatre devices. The shocking reality is that the consumer leasing company relies on revenue from the Australian welfare system. A report released by finance company Credit Suisse has expressed that any change in the rules that regulate the consumer leasing industry would have a huge effect on Radio Rentals and their business. Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service offered by Centrelink and deducts welfare payments in manageable amounts in order to pay nominated bills. Those bills can be toward rent, electricity, gas, water, ambulance or medical services and many more.

Scroll down for video . Ashley Johnston, 28, was reportedly killed while fighting for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) on February 24 . Mourners held up framed photos of Johnston, 28, and the Australian flag to pay tribute to him. His coffin was adorned in a red cloth with yellow and green ribbon wrapped around it. On top of the casket, bright yellow flowers were attached. A picture of the fallen Australia was stuck at the foot of the coffin, while it was carried through the streets by four pallbearers. Mr Johnston, known as Heval Bagok, along with British man Konstandinos Erik Scurfield were honoured together . Mourners held up framed photos of Mr Johnston and the Australian flag to pay tribute to him . Days after his death, Johnston's mother revealed she did not know her son was fighting against Islamic State (IS) until he was killed in Iraq. On February 24, the truck he was travelling in reportedly broke down and his group were 'outnumbered and outgunned' by IS fighters. A fellow fighter also recalled how Johnston died, saying the Australian 'sacrificed himself' for his comrades. This comes as Johnston said in his final interview before his death, that he was afraid of returning home because he thought he'd be treated like a terrorist. Amanda Johnston, of Canberra, told The Sydney Morning Herald that she thought her son was with the Kurds because he was doing some humanitarian work. Ms Johnston said she only knew of his whereabouts from a text message sent by her son on December 30. Johnston had informed his mother that he was in the Middle East 'supporting the Kurdish people'. Ms Johnston learnt of her son's death on Thursday, saying she was shocked by the news and is in disbelief that he was killed while fighting ISIS. A former Australian soldier was reportedly fighting for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in Iraq and Syria but was killed on February 24 .

The Lions of Rojava posted this tribute to the Australian man they claim has been killed while fighting for them . It is believed the 28-year-old's remains are in an unstable area near the Iraq and Syria border . Measures are being taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in order to bring Mr Johnston's body back home . Ashley Johnston told Vanity Fair reporter James Harking he was afraid of a lengthy prison sentence back in Australia. He served for seven years with Australia's Army Reserves before going travelling and becoming moved by struggle of ethnic Kurds against IS militants who have taken control of large parts of Syria of Iraq. The Lions Of Rojava said in a statement: 'What we can disclose is his story of heroism and self-sacrifice for the Kurdish people. Throughout his time in Kurdistan he had a positive impact on my people's lives though his humility and kindness to everyone he met. 'He was taken from us in a heroic assault on ISIS positions in a small village near Shingal. His squad of eight fighters were in a truck which had broken down and it was critical that they dislodge ISIS from their positions so they pushed on fearlessly with little regard for their own safety. 'They were massively outnumbered and outgunned but fearless in the face of this as they knew another ISIS death meant saving the lives of countless civilians. He was a fearless and exceptional soldier as well a great man,' the Facebook statement read. Fellow comrades say Johnston died after a military tank was encircled by ISIS fighters, so the Australian sacrificed himself as he 'jumped out of the panzer to cover us' A fellow fighter detailed one of the final conversations she had with Johnston, who said that he fought for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) because he 'couldn't take the children and women that ISIS-thugs slaughtered' Days later, a fellow fighter Bejan Dagli a YPJ fighter, told of her final moments spent with Johnston on the same Facebook page. When she asked the former Australian soldier why he was fighting for YPG he said: 'ISIS [another name for IS] is a world's problem. I couldn't take the children and women that ISIS-thugs did slaughtered and that's why l have come to Kurdistan.' Dagli says other comrades who witnessed Johnston's death said that 'he sacrificed himself for us'. When asked how, one of the comrades responded with tears in her eyes: 'The panzer that we were inside was encircled by the ISIS-thugs and he jumped out of the panzer to cover us that we could break the encirclement and then he got martyred while trying to cover us and break the siege.' Dagli also released photos she had taken of Johnston just five days before his death and wrote about how he was picking up Kurdish. Ashley Johnston (front, second from right) has been remembered by his friends as the 'best mate' Fighter Bejan Dagli wrote about the final moments of former Australian soldier Ashley Johnston . This comes after the YPG shared the grotesque images and celebratory message on their 'Lions of Rojava' Facebook page, claiming that the murders by YPG and YPJ were in the name of Ashley Johnston, his family and for Australia. 'The YPG & YPJ has killed many ISIS terrorists pigs in Til Hemis,' they wrote. 'Our Comrade from Australia, Heval Bagok Serhed, was martyred during the liberation of Til Hemis.' They gloated that the slaughter was a form of payback for Johnston, who they refer to as a 'martyr'. In the images soldiers hug, smile and pose with the peace symbol. 'We took revenge for Heval Bagok, for his family, Australia and the world. His comrades says that it was a revenge for him and his family.' Ashley Johnston, originally from Maryborough in Queensland but had most recently been living in Canberra, was remembered by friends and colleagues from an Australian army rifle brigade as 'a good man' and 'the best mate'. It is understood that Johnston is the first foreign casualty from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG). 'Defence is aware that a former Australian Army Reserve member is believed to have been killed in northern Iraq while allegedly fighting with Peshmerga forces against Daesh,' the ADF said in a statement. 'Due to the provisions of the Privacy Act, Defence will not release further information about the former member's military service or their personal details.'","Australian Ashley Johnston was killed in Iraq while fighting Islamic State .

"In the small Alaskan town of Whittier, which sees up to 250 inches of snow annually, nearly all of the 218 residents live in one multi-story house. Surrounded by only mountains and the sea, the remote town is so isolated that it's only accessible by North America's longest one way tunnel, which stretches for two and a half miles. But the tunnel, which alternates directions every half an hour, closes at 11pm until re-opening at 5:30 the following morning. Scroll down for video . In the small town of Whittier, Alaska, nearly all 218 residents live in one single multi-story building .

Filmmaker, Mary Katzke, a fellow Alaskan from Anchorage, was one of the first to take interest in the peculiar small town and its unusual daily realities. She said: 'This community has always been of interest due to its primary place of residence being one tower - the Begich Tower. The building, the Begich Tower, houses the entire neighbourhood, including convenience stores and a school . A filmmaker from Anchorage, Alaska, has recently taken interest in developing a project about the town . The building was first constructed by the U.S. Army in the 1950s, but is now under civilian ownership . It is only accessible by a two-and-a-half mile, one-way tunnel, which alternates directions during the day . What makes the town so fascinating is that despite the geographical isolation, families have continual contact . 'There is so much geographic isolation yet continual contact via this living set up. 'The residents work for the port, as boat mechanics, or in the city or occasionally drive out to work outside the community.' There are a few rebels to this particular living arrangement, however, such as Paul, who has opted to live in his 'immobile' motor home. Most residents work for the port, as boat mechanics, but a few do drive out to work outside the community . In the brutal winters, the town may see up to 250 inches of snowfall, but in the summer, it's another story . In the summer, the city sees up to 22 hours of sun a day and about 900,000 tourists who visit via cruise ships . It has long been of interest as a filming location, though recent enquiries are focused on a reality show . One of the rebels to this particular living arrangement is Paul, who resides in an 'immobile' mobile home . Although the town remains quite sleepy during the brutal winter months, in the summer, it's a completely different story. As many as 900,000 tourists pass through the town from cruise ships during the warmer months, when the town enjoys up to 22 hours of sunlight. The creation of the 14-story building began in 1953 by the U.S. Army, but came into civilian ownership a few years later when the Army left the town. Although in the past, the town has been the subject of interest for a big budget film, recent requests have centred more on the potential for a reality show or real-life Neighbours.","In this small Alaskan town, almost all 218 residents live in the same place .

"Most people upsize their house to accommodate a growing family. But retired couple Huw and Jan Smith have a rather more fuzzy reason for moving into a bigger home – because behind the doors of their new residence live hundreds and hundreds of teddy bears. The pair have more than 600 of the cuddly toys crammed into their four-bedroom detached property. Huw Smith surrounded by his collection of some 600 bears at his home in Lancaster . The couple moved into this four-bedroom home having found their three-bedroom terrace was too small for their ever growing collection of teddy bears . The couple, who give each bear its own name, recently moved house to accommodate their large collection, which they have amassed over the past 23 years and estimate to be worth £4,500. Mr Smith, a former product manager, said some people could not understand why they would spend their money on cuddly toys. ‘Our friends think we have more money than sense, but we love our bears so much,' he said. ‘We’ve had to move just to fit them all in. In our previous place it was getting to be a tight squeeze but it’s less cluttered now. ‘We’ve unpacked them all and they seem to be loving their new home. ‘One of the hardest things about moving house was having to pack them all into plastic bags. We felt awful doing it, it just didn’t feel right.’ The couple, who don’t have any children, began collecting teddy bears in 1991 following the death of their pet golden Labrador, Biffer. Huw sits among a plethora of bears in one of the bedrooms at his home . They name and photograph each one and record when and where it was purchased in a detailed computerised log book. In October they decided to move from their three-bedroom terraced home in St Albans, Hertforshire, to a larger house in Lancaster to accommodate their massive brood of soft toys. They have so many that every room of their new property is filled with different types of bears. ‘While we had the dog we couldn’t really start collecting the bears as he would have had them,’ said 60-year-old Mr Smith. Mr Smith cuddles up to their first ever bear, Mischief, which they bought following the death of their dog . Huw in the lounge of his new home having relocated with his wife Jan to accommodate the collection . ‘But after he died we bought a teddy, sort of as a replacement pet, and from there we just carried on. It wasn’t really a conscious thing, but now, 20 years later we have hundreds. ‘We get the bears from all over the place. Gifts from friends and family, places we visit, holidays abroad, markets, auction houses and the high street. ‘They are a real mixed bag and are all very unique. We have some that cost a couple of pounds from charity shops to others worth a few hundred. ‘The most expensive is Steve, he was bought for my wife as a present when she worked for the council. We think he is worth about £260. ‘We don’t buy designer ones like Steiff’s as they are very expensive but we have got some lovely bears from John Lewis and Harrods.’ The many boxes the couple used to transport more than 600 teddy bears from their former home in St Albans to their new house in Lancaster . Mr and Mrs Smith named this bear Corfe, the smallest in their collection, which they bought from Dorset . Mr Smith said he and his wife love the bears so much they are ‘like family'. ‘One of the first ones we ever got was a John Lewis bear called Mischief,’ he said. ‘The largest is a three feet tall bear called Conrad. We got him in Brighton and had to bring him back on the train. He was so big he needed his own seat. ‘They have pride of place in the lounge and the kitchen, while the dining room and bedrooms are full of them too. People who come to visit think we’re mad. ‘When we have guests we don’t move them or put them away. Our friends have to sit around them, but they love it. They’re always posing for pictures with them.’ Mrs Smith, 63, who until recently worked as an administrator for her local museum service, added: ‘We never had any children of our own but I wouldn’t say they were our fur-kids. ‘They are just incredibly well-loved bears. I think they all have such different beautiful faces.’ Teddy bears started in 1903 when a cartoon appeared in an American newspaper depicting American President Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt refusing to shoot a bear cub that was tied to a tree. Soon after, an enterprising novelty shop owner in New York made some toy bears and sold them as Teddy’s Bear.","Huw and Jan Smith have amassed more than 600 teddies of all sizes .

"The Christian feast of Holy Thursday is a generally somber affair, but  it also carries a daunting, if less religiously significant, challenge for food lovers. What would you have for your Last Supper? Unsurprisingly, celebrity chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and Donatella Arpaia want more from their final courses than a simple breaking of bread. Deciding on a final meal has been a long-time game among chefs, though deciding which flavors would be their last has never been easy. Photographer Melanie Dunae brought the question to the masses with her My Last Supper books, though she provided help from some of the sharpest and most famous knives in the kitchen. Chefs such as Gordon Ramsay, Bobby Flay and Rachael Ray made choices ranging from cheeseburgers to  pastas to elaborate truffle dishes to Yorkshire pudding. One thing they'd have in common, however. The meal would probably be pretty good no matter what they decided to cook. Donatella Arpaia . Donatella Arpaia said that her Last Supper would be handmade spaghetti with fresh tomato and basil sauce . The American Iron Chef judge, 43, would go out after an Italian meal that stayed true to her family's roots. 'I would pick handmade spaghetti with fresh tomato and basil sauce, along with freshly baked focaccia, some thinly sliced prosciutto and burrata,' the chef, who recently opened a pizzeria, told the New York Post. 'My first taste sense memory when I fell in love with food was spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil one summer in Capri. It was love at first bite, and I want it to be my last bite as well.' Mario Batali . Mario Batali would go to Italy for his final meal and set himself a huge feast with bruschetta and other seafood pasta dishes . Batali, 54, would want to return to the Amalfi coast in Italy, and dine on a huge multi-course dinner starting with bruschetta and including a main course of a shrimp and zucchini pasta, scialatielli ai gamberetti. The feast would also include mussels, sauteed shrimp dishes and limoncello vinaigrette grilled lobster. However, the former Food Network chef and owner of restaurants around the world would not cook his final meal, preferring to let a local woman prepare his favorite dishes. Michelle Bernstein . The Miami-based Michelle Bernstein would go for a number of dishes made by her mother before the end, but would start with lemon oysters . Michelle Bernstein, a James Beard award-winning chef who runs two restaurants in Miami, said she would take a particularly long time with her final meal so she could 'slow down and taste every morsel.' She would start off with a dozen lemon oysters before asparagus on top of her mother's potato pancakes. The 46-year-old would then pick dishes from her favorite chefs, such as Gary Danko and Alain Ducasse including braised foie gras with truffles and lobster. Bernstein, who claims a mix of Latin and Jewish heritage, would also eat her mother's lasagna and upside-down pear cake before a range of pastries and her own banana cream pie. Anthony Bourdain . Television host Anthony Bourdain has traveled the world but would take his final meal of bone marrow at St John in London . Anthony Bourdain, 58, has probably gained the most fame for his travel show, but still serves as chef-at-large at New York's Brasserie Les Halles. He said he would want his final meal to be at St John in London prepared by its chef Fergus Henderson. Bourdain, who said he would like to be alone for his last bites before the grave, would not linger at the table, preferring only roast bone marrow with parsley and a caper salad accompanied by some baguette slices. The well-traveled chef would enjoy his final meal with a Guinness. Bobby Flay . American chef Bobby Flay kept it simple and decided on a 'crunchified' burger with a light draft beer . Though other chefs longed for foreign shores and truffles in their Last Suppers, 50-year-old American chef Bobby Flay would keep it simple with a cheeseburger. The star of numerous Food Network shows would jazz up his final morsel with chipotle ketchup and  jalapenos, and 'crunchify' it with potato chips on top of the meat. Though he contended that the beer is not the important part of the meal, Flay said that he would have a light draft such as a Coors. Desert would be an ice cream sundae with a cherry on top. Anita Lo . Anita Lo, chef of New York City's Annisa, said that her last meal would incorporate both French and Asian cuisines along with sweetbreads and truffles . Anita Lo, the chef of New York City's Annisa, said that her last meal would include her favorite ingredients, sweetbreads and truffles. She enjoys mixing French and Asian cuisines and would continue doing so up until her final course. Lo, who has famously competed on both Top Chef and Chopped: All Stars, would also include sushi in her Last Supper. Maria Loi . Manhattan restaurant owner Maria Loi's last meal would take her back to her homeland of Greece, including a very specific type of oregano . Originally from Greece, Maria Loi would stick with the food she loved in childhood. 'I’d have freshly baked crusty bread with Greek extra virgin olive oil,' she said. The owner of Loi Estiatorio would mix in feta cheese and a perfectly ripe tomato, though she would need to make a long journey to find the perfect spice. Loi said that her final meal would require dried Greek oregano, but only from Mount Taygetos, . Jamie Oliver . Celebrity chef Jaimie Oliver said that he would have spaghetti all'arrabiata for his final meal, as well as rice pudding . If he was facing impending death, Englishman Jamie Oliver would turn to his comfort food, spaghetti all’arrabiata with three types of chilies. Oliver said that he would take the meal at his house in Essex and eat rice pudding with carmelized roast peaches for desert. The 39-year-old would wash it all down with a bottle of Hoegaarden beer. Gordon Ramsay . Gordon Ramsay has been asked about his Last Supper multiple times, most recently saying that he would have roast beef . The Scottish-born chef, famous for ripping apart budding proteges on his shows such as Hell's Kitchen, would settle down for a roast dinner before shuffling off the mortal coil. The 48-year-old would choose roast beef with Yorkshire pudding and red wine gravy, according to TIME. He would also listen to the first album of the musicians Keane while eating it in his London home and drinking Bâtard-Montrachet wine. Ramsay also previously told the Guardian that he would have black Perigord and white Alba truffle with his roast . Desert would be chocolate fondant and white milk ice cream. Rachael Ray . The Food Network's Rachael Ray said that she prefers to think of her meal happening in heaven, and would eat spaghetti aglio e olio with her grandfather . The star of her own self-titled show, Rachael Ray said that she wouldn't be able to enjoy her last meal. However, once she went to the great beyond, Ray said she would like to eat spaghetti aglio e olio with large amounts of anchovies, garlic, parsley, chili and EVOO. She said her departed grandfather would cook fish with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, wine and lemon. Ray said she and her grandfather would drink Sicilian wine.","Chefs have decided what they would have for last meal for a long time .

"An Islamic State propaganda website geared towards celebrating the sacrifice made by Melbourne teenage jihadi, Jake Bilardi, has done anything but glorify the actions of the 18-year-old suicide bomber. The post, titled as the story of Abu Abdullah Al-Austrālī – the name Bilardi adopted after he travelled to Iraq to join IS – gives the teenager some praise as a devout Muslims who prays and fasts often. But the rant describes Bilardi as having ‘a weak body’ and having 'sold his soul for a cheap price' - revealing how misguided his decisions were. Scroll down for video . The photograph of Melbourne teen Jake Bilardi which was first released to show his allegiance to Islamic State . Bilardi, who fled to the Middle East last year from his Melbourne home, reportedly died after he blew himself up in a suicide mission targeting the Iraqi armed forces at Ramadi in central Iraq last week. The attack was a failure. Iraqi military spokesman General Tahssin Ibrahim said no one was killed and just a few vehicles were damaged in Bilardi's suicide mission. The extremist site seeks to praise Bilardi but delivers backhanded comments describing his weakness and ultimately the futility of his sacrifice. ‘He started fighting in Baijī against the ISF Rāfidha and was a lion on the battlefield although he was at a young age and with a weak body, he was like a mountain,’ the post on a tumblr blog site associated with the Islamic extremist group said. It goes on to say that Bilardi volunteered for a 'martyrdom operation' - code words for a suicide bombing - and that he was eager to carry out the mission. Suicide bomber: ISIS leaked a photograph of 18-year-old Australian Jake Bilardi (pictured) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it . Earlier social media posts suggested Bilardi had wanted to take part in a suicide bombing in Baiji in Iraq, but that he pulled out of this mission because he got cold feet. Instead he fought in the city before again signing up for martrydom and being sent to Ramadi in Iraq. The latest post said Bilardi was 'full of happiness as he was finally going to meet his Lord and receive the great rewards promised by Him.' But it goes on to mock his sacrifice. 'This brother originated from an atheist family & ended up selling his soul to Allah for a cheap price,' the post says. Bilardi (pictured, left) in a school photo from Year 10 - the year he converted to Islam, according to school friends, and  wearing a Chelsea Football Club shirt (pictured right) Last week an image of Bilardi sitting in front of an Islamic State flag was posted to Twitter . The post said that during his time in Ramadi, Bilardi was very devout 'known for his worship of Allah' and would fast every other day. It said Bilardi accepted Islam three years ago ‘even though his parents basically went to war with him at home tried to stop him from reverting’. 'Happy-slapped': Bilardi was bullied while at high school in Craigieburn in Melbourne's north, and video emerged last night showing him being 'happy-slapped' The bullying tactic sees a group of people slap their victim and film it on a camera phone before uploading it online in order to humiliate them . Bilardi, a former Craigieburn Secondary College student, converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10 - shortly after his mother died of cancer. A video later surfaced from his school days which shows Bilardi being 'happy slapped' - a bullying tactic which sees a group of people slap their victim, film it and upload it online to humiliate them. In December, Bilardi reached Ramadi, a city located in central Iraq, and said he 'made hijra (or departed)’ in August.","Islamic State propaganda sought to praise 18-year-old Australia jihadi .

"Budget chain Aldi is launching a 'boutique' range of wines - but will only allow thirsty customers to buy four bottles at a time. Shoppers enticed by the new fine wines will only be able to buy a limited number during each supermarket trip, in a bid to ensure the range remains exclusive. In a further bid to appeal to 'upmarket' customers, the German discounter will also put an individual number on each of the bottles. Aldi is launching a range of 'boutique' wines costing £9.99 each which will include a Tasmanian Chardonnay (left) and a French red Pezenas (right) The wines, which will come with a specially-commissioned hand-painted tag, will retail at £9.99, more than double the price of its usual range. The launch is the chain's latest attempt to lure families from across the social spectrum and particularly to tap into the taste of middle and higher income shoppers. The supermarket's continuing success means sales are growing at around 19 per cent a year. It also now has a market share of five per cent - almost the same as Waitrose. A spokesman for Aldi said the range has been created by some of the world's most prestigious winemakers for the 'upmarket' customers. The four wines which make up the range include red Argentinian Malbec Cabernet, white Tasmanian Chardonnay, French red Pezenas and white Chilean Valle De Leyda Sauvignon. The bottle of Chardonnay, Pezenas and Sauvignon will be available to buy from March 30, 2015. The Malbec Cabernet will follow in May. There will also be an Argentinian Malbec Cabernet (right), as well as a Chilean Valle De Leyda Sauvignon (left) Jean-Claude Mas, who partnered with Aldi to create the Pezenas wine, said: 'The decision to collaborate with Aldi was an easy one as I have kept a keen eye on its budding reputation as a top quality wine merchant over the last few years. 'I admire their ethos of making fantastic wines available at accessible price - it opens up the wonderful world of wine to everyone.' Mike James, Aldi's wine buyer, added: 'We pride ourselves on our hands-on approach and close relationships with some of the world's best suppliers. 'Collaborating so closely to produce such a beautiful range - whilst still offering excellent value to our shoppers - has been a real challenge, but we have relished it.' Malbec Cabernet (£9.99, 75cl): The Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot grapes in this blend are from some of the highest vineyards in the world. Some savoury notes on the nose add complexity to the fruit which contribute to the rich and fresh fruit flavours on the palate, with some added spice. Tasmanian Chardonnay (£9.99, 75cl): This delightful Tasmanian Chardonnay has notes of ripe lemon with a nod to tropical fruit, honey dew melon and a tang of cream giving it a clean almost glacial freshness. Full and smooth with underlying mineral notes, enjoy today or wonder at its development through to 2018. Pezenas (£9.99, 75cl) Rich and charming, with a deep ruby colour, this red is full of character and flair with black cherry, blackberry and even chocolate notes. Ripe black fruits and spices (cloves, vanilla, and liquorice) create an intense and unique flavour which can be enjoyed today or left to develop over the coming decade. Valle de Leyda Sauvignon (£9.99, 75cl) A unique and perfectly balanced signature of Sauvignon Blanc; this exuberant wine is full of fantastic aromas with layers of ripe stone fruit and tropicality. Intriguing floral notes come with a bit of a smoky minerality, freshness and mouth puckering acidity, but with a delightful texture.

"It brings new meaning to the phrase 'shark attack'. While most people will be familiar with images of seals being violently smashed out of the water snatched in the jaws of a shark, it appears some are exacting their revenge on the ocean predators. Scientists have reported multiple cases of cape fur seals attacking blue sharks off the coast of South Africa. Scroll down for video . Scientists have reported multiple cases of cape fur seals attacking blue sharks and eating their guts off the coast of South Africa. Diver Chris Fallows captured this image. The behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals have turned to attacking the torpedo-shaped sharks . The seals, which are normally prey for great white sharks, have been seen attacking and killing medium-sized blue sharks, devouring their guts before leaving the rest of the carcass. Divers also report seeing the fur seals attacking other species of shark and rays. The behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals, which normally hunt smaller fish, have turned to attacking the torpedo-shaped sharks. The blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator. It was first observed by marine photographer Chris Fallows, who runs a dive boat operation from Cape Town in South Africa. Dr Neil Hammerschlaf, a marine biologist at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Astmospheric Science who was involved in the study, said the seals appear to be eating the guts of the sharks as they contain the most energy. The blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator. An expert said there are relatively few reports of pinnipeds, or seals, preying on sharks in general, and in all cases these involved smaller sharks . Blue sharks, like the one above, are one of the ocean's top predators with a sleek body and mouth full of teeth. Dr Neil Hammerschlaf, a marine biologist at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Astmospheric Science said the seals appear to be eating the guts of these sharks as they contain the most energy . He said this behaviour may have serious implications for blue sharks, as their numbers are already in decline due to over fishing. 'Seals are generally considered prey of larger sharks,and blue sharks have been observed pursuing juvenile and adult male Cape fur seals, though no kills have been witnessed,' he continued. 'There are relatively few reports of pinnipeds (seals) preying on sharks in general and in all cases these involved smaller sharks. Cape fur seals, like the one pictured, normally use their manoeuverability to prey upon smaller fish and squid. Scientists believe that the seals could also be attacking the sharks partly to remove competition for the fish they normally eat . 'The consumption of large sharks by a Cape fur seal is a departure from the prevalent view of this species’ diet, which is generally reported to consist of a diverse diet of small fish species, cephalopods and birds. 'The prevalence of the behaviour reported here is unknown - it could reflect opportunistic predation by a generalist predator or it might be a common tactic. 'These observations are important not just for understanding the interactions between these two species but more broadly for their implications in understanding the trophic ecology of pinnipeds - many populations of which have increased while numerous shark populations have declined.' Length: Males typically grow up to 7.5ft (2.3 metres) Weight: Males weigh 440 to 660lbs (200 to 300kg) Weapons: Large canine teeth, powerful jaws and claws . Normal prey: Mainly fish but also about a fifth of their diet is squid and sometimes crabs . Behaviour: They can live up to 30 years and then to gather in small groups but will often swim alone. They can dive as deep as 200 metres (650 feet) and stay underwater for seven minutes. They are commonly attacked by great white sharks, which attack them from below, and killer whales which hunt them in packs. Length: Females grow between 6 to 9.3ft (1.82 to 2.82 metres) Weight: Females weigh 205 to 401lbs (93 to 182kg) Weapons: Multiple rows of triangular serrated teeth . Normal prey: Bony fish,  cuttlefish, octopus, shrimp and crabs . Behaviour: Their sleek body shape makes them fast and efficient swimmers, allowing them to snatch their prey out of the water. Blue sharks live for up to 20 years, are known as an open water species, and often migrate long distances. They are preyed upon by  larger sharks like the great white and tiger shark. Fur seals have been known to mob great white sharks in large numbers but this is thought to be a defensive tactic to scare them away from breeding colonies. In this case the fur seals have been observed attacking the blue sharks, which are open ocean predators that can grow to be about 9ft long (2.82 metres), on their own. Mr Fallows, who runs Apex Expeditions, first noticed the behaviour in 2004 while on a dive off Cape Town. Fur seals are common prey for great white sharks, which snatch them in their jaws from below (above). Fur seals will often group together and mob these sharks, but this is thought to be a defensive tactic . In 2012 he again saw a large Cape fur seal attack five blue sharks from a shoal of ten over a two hour period. The sharks were estimated to measure between 3.6ft (1.1 metres) and 4.5ft (1.4 metres) in length. Mr Fallows said: 'They swim up to them and grab them. There is no protracted chase. 'It is almost as though the sharks are not expecting this to happen and do not overly react to the seals advances. 'We have seen them feeding on three other small species of sharks. We have also observed them feeding on rays. 'I would think it is possibly a learned behaviour based on limited normal food availability.' A study on the behaviour is now published in the African Journal of Marine Science. Scientists believe the seals could be attacking the sharks partly to remove competition for the fish they normally eat. Dominic Tollit, a marine mammal consultant with the Sea Mammal Research Unit in Canada, told New Scientist that attacking such a large and heavily armed predator is a high risk strategy if simply looking for food. He said: 'Would you attack a lion if you're hungry, or would you go for something smaller?'","Scientists report cape fur seals have been attacking and killing blue sharks .

"End in sight: Padge-Victoria Windslowe, 45, finished testifying Friday in her buttocks-injection murder . A transgender hip-hop artist finished testifying Friday in her buttocks-injection murder trial but not before she asked to say something more to the jury. Padge-Victoria Windslowe looked dejected when her lawyer quickly shut down her request. 'I wanted to say something from my heart,' Windslowe grumbled. The 45-year-old Windslowe testified for two and a half days about the 2011 death of a London dancer she injected with silicone at an airport hotel. ‘My client's not a murderer,’ defense lawyer David Rudenstein said in closing arguments Friday. ‘It's clear she gave butt injections to people. That doesn't make her guilty of third-degree murder or aggravated assault.’ Big-city doctors at the time were only first seeing patients injured by black-market silicone injections, but Windslowe had experienced only good results, he said. And he urged jurors to avoid bias about his client's lifestyle, which included her turn as ‘the Black Madam’ running an escort service; as a dominatrix in slickly-produced music videos; and as the faux surgeon ‘Lillian’ catering to strippers and fellow transgender women. ‘The case is not about lifestyle, about whether you ... personally disliked the defendant,’ Rudenstein said. ‘The people who saw my client came from a certain walk (of life). They weren't going to a medical office. They were going to a hotel room. They were all kind of in it (together).’ Prosecutors were set to give their closing arguments later on Friday. It is not clear if the six-man, six-woman jury will begin deliberations before the weekend. Windslowe complained of chest pains at the courthouse Monday as she prepared to return to the witness stand. She was released late Wednesday and back in custody at a Philadelphia prison where she has been held since her arrest in 2012. On trial: Windslowe (left), 45, has been charged with killing 20-year-old London dancer Claudia Aderotimi (right) The defendants proved to be a riveting witness during three days on the stand, claiming in her many colorful tangents that she crossed paths with rappers Kanye West and Nicki Minaj, model Amber Rose and Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and ex-mayor of Philadelphia. Windslowe bragged that clients, among them celebrities, chose her to perform silicone buttocks injections over licensed surgeons because of her deft work. But authorities believe Windslowe caused the death of Claudia Aderotimi in 2011 and injured several other women through shoddy silicone injections. She clashed with Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega who questioned why people like Rose and her friends would choose an unlicensed practitioner over a Los Angeles plastic surgeon. 'I was the best, and I don't mean that to be cocky,' Windslowe said in earlier testimony. Windslowe said she learned the lucrative buttocks injection business from doctors in Thailand and Ecuador — vaguely referred to as Dr. Morales, Dr. Chimchoke and Dr. Vu — who performed her sex-change surgeries. She said she has since performed thousands of the procedures on devoted clients including rappers, strippers and women in customer-service jobs, earning the name 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections.' On the stand Friday, Windslowe denied that she was on the run in the 18 months following Aderotimi's death, when Windslowe acknowledged that she changed addresses at least five times. Tragic death: Aderotimi died in 2011 after she was injected with low-grade silicone, which spread to the woman's lungs, liver and brain . She said she believed that investigators were still trying to find out why the woman died, given that so many of her other clients, she said, had no problems with the injections. 'If you wanted me, you would have come and got me,' Windslowe said. Aderotimi died after she was injected with low-grade silicone at Philadelphia airport hotel. Doctors have told jurors during the two-week trial that the syringe hit a vein and sent silicone to the woman's lungs, liver and brain. Two other women testified they spent months in the hospital with similar injuries after visits with Windslowe, including 23-year-old stripper Sherkeeia King, who received an injection on a dining room table at a 'pumping party' that sent her to the hospital vomiting blood. Windslowe faces 20 to 40 years in prison if convicted of third-degree murder in Aderotimi's death, and potentially more time for aggravated assault and practicing medicine without a license. Seedy side buisness: Windslowe said her nickname 'Black Madam' came from years spent running an escort service employing male, female and transgender sex workers . Big business: Although she was unlicensed, Windslowe charged about $1,000 to $2,000 per session depending on the amount of silicone requested . She said she started doing body sculpting two decades ago to help transgender friends. Transgender women often want to plump up an indent in the side of the buttocks they call 'the boy pocket,' she said. Windslowe charged about $1,000 to $2,000 per session depending on the amount of silicone requested. Some clients, including a pole dancer she discussed last Friday, saw her a half-dozen times.","Padge-Victoria Windslowe, 45, asked to say something 'from the heart' to the jury, but her defense attorney stopped her from speaking .

"These are the shocking images which show how public housing commission tenants are leasing their properties to pocket some extra cash and then trashing them in the process. In an investigation by Nine Network's A Current Affair on Tuesday night, it was revealed that a number of public housing homes have illegally been placed on the rental market. Housing commission tenant Tammy Kenyon, from Geelong in Victoria - who also goes by the online alias 'Holdenchick Kenyon' - has been caught acting as a landlord while advertising her property on Facebook.

"From old television sets with only two channels, to salt and pepper shakers found inside an abandoned TB hospital, these images document the slow but steady decline of rural Britain. This incredible set of photographs, taken across 15,000 miles of Norfolk's most rugged terrain, brings home the reality of that disappearing lifestyle like never before. From rotting farmhouses to rusting cars and even a set of abandoned petrol pumps, photographer Brian Wells, 43, has sought to bring the decline of the countryside to life. Decay: A rusting pick-up truck is pictured on the old site of Medlars Vehicle Dismantler's, near Stratton Strawless in the Norfolk countryside . Forgotten: Petrol pumps covered with old, peeling red paint, were discovered by photographer Brian Wells, 43, close to the village of Seething . Rotting: Paradise Farm, a Grade II listed 17th century farmhouse situated on private land in Stradsett, which is now being renovated . Ancient: An old Aga is seen at Bessingham Manor House, which has now been fully restored. Legend has it that one of the former owners, Edmund Spurrell, used to entertain the guests at dinner parties with a dancing bear which is buried in the grounds . Relics: Medicine bottles found in a large derelict house in the village of Methwold, know locally as 'The Pickelman's House', due the fact that there are a multitude of pickle jars in the pantry . He said 'My photographs highlight the beauty in the broken that we usually overlook. I am drawn to the history held within the abandoned buildings and rusting rustic objects, and marvels at the possibilities that each alludes to. 'Ruins capture the viewer’s imagination with their ability to tell stories. They are a window into human histories, silent rooms with dust covered furniture, discarded objects that are left behind and a smell of mustiness lingering in the air echoing a past long gone. 'I feel that one of the most powerful aspects of a ruin is the subject that's missing in the photograph - the people who once worked and lived in these places. Their presence can still be felt.' Time gone by: An old container of Cadbury's Marvel dried milk power and a glass jar prop up a copy of Parade magazine on a rotting shelf at this unknown location . Lost choice: Dials on this television set show it dates from a time when there were only two channels, almost unthinkable to those born today . Gone bust: While the numbers on these tiles may appear to be random, they are in fact prices, found inside the old Yallops Shoes store on St. Augustines Street, Norwich . Spooky: This shot was taken inside an old prefabricated bungalow named 'Regina', in Felthorpe. A swathe of prefab homes were built to house those whose homes were destroyed after the Second World War . Packed up: This suitcase was found in a forlorn cottage on the side of the busy A47 towards Kings Lynn in the village of East Winch. A luggage tag still attached to it reads 'Albert' Brian said he uses ordinance survey maps, and an ancient Kelly's Dictionary, the Victorian equivalent of the Yellow Pages, in order to track down the long forgotten sites. He added: 'Checking out the Auction pages in local newspapers is useful and 'Urban Exploration' websites also come in handy. “I always seek permission where possible to photograph the property, especially if it is not isolated. Most of the time I get a positive reply.' Empty: These old salt and pepper shakers were found inside a former night porters' cabin, at an abandoned TB Hospital in Mundesley . Fancy a sit down? This tatty armchair, discovered in an abandoned house in an unknown location, has not been used in decades . Not in use: A rusting plug socket for a cooker is seen on a mouldy wall in derelict cottage on the outskirts of the Toftrees estate, Norfolk . Peeling: Sixties-style wallpaper is seen falling from the damp walls inside a derelict cottage located along Doles Lane, in Bradwell . Stuck in the past: An out-dated doll figure is seen standing in front of three mirrors inside an abandoned house at an unknown location .","Brian Wells, 43, used Kelly's Dictionary, the Victorian equivalent of the Yellow Pages, to track down forgotten places .

"Opponents of Vladimir Putin last night feared a new wave of political assassinations after a series of chilling death threats were issued to friends of murdered politician Boris Nemtsov. In Moscow, a funeral wreath was delivered to the home of an aide to Putin’s arch-enemy, exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. And amid reports of a ‘death list’ compiled by Chechen hitmen loyal to Putin, another in Nemtsov’s circle, glamorous socialite-turned-politician Kseniya Sobchak, yesterday said she had hired armed guards after being warned at his funeral: ‘You’re next’. The news came amid wild rumours over Putin’s continued non-appearance in public, fuelling talk of a power struggle behind the scenes. Fear: Friends of the murdered opposition leader Boris Nemtsov (right) are in fear for their lives, after rumours of a 'hit list' began to circulate - naming people like socialite-turned-politician Kseniya Sobchak (right) Disappearance: The rumours came as Vladimir Putin failed to appear in public - fuelling rumours of a behind-the-scenes power struggle . Sceptics were unconvinced by photos of the president meeting the chairman of Russia’s supreme court released on Friday, suspicious over when they were taken. Nemtsov, 55, was gunned down within yards of the Kremlin on February 27 while walking on a bridge with his girlfriend, model Anna Duritskaya, 23. Ms Sobchak, 33, said that since his funeral she has ‘enhanced her security’, adding: ‘Now I have to walk around with bodyguards.’ Khodorkovsky’s press secretary, Olga Pispanen, found the wreath containing 60 flowers outside her Moscow flat on Wednesday and uploaded a picture to Facebook. ‘There was no note,’ she told The Moscow Times. ‘I don’t know where it came from, but it is a funeral wreath.’ Khodorkovsky, once Russia’s richest man, served ten years in jail on fraud charges his supporters said were trumped up in revenge for the former oil tycoon interfering in politics. After being freed in 2013 he moved to Switzerland, but is often seen in London. Meanwhile, another friend of Nemtsov revealed just how rattled he became after receiving a death threat last summer, following a post on his blog about Chechens fighting alongside pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine. Ludmila Shabueva, a senior journalist at independent radio station Echo of Moscow, said: ‘Boris came to our station to take part in a show. I asked him why he looked so upset. ‘He replied, “Luda, they want to kill me” ... he showed me a text message which read, “Jackal. I will kill you.”’ November 1998: Less than four months after Putin took over takes at the KGB, Galina Starovoitova, the most prominent pro-democracy Kremlin critic was murdered. The politician, who was State Duma deputy at the time, was shot to death in the stairwell of her home in central St Petersburg in what appeared to be a 'politically motivated' attack. March 2000: Putin was elected as leader and Russian ordered attacks in Chechnya. Opposition leaders, especially those who reported on the conflict in Chechnya were killed. Reporters Igor Domnikov, Sergey Novikov, Iskandar Khatloni, Sergey Ivanov and Adam Tepsurgayev were all killed in 2000 alone. April 2003: Sergei Yushenkov, co-chairman of the Liberal Russia political party was gunned down at the entrance of his Moscow apartment block. Viktor Yushchenko (left), anti-Russian candidate for the presidency of the Ukraine, was poisoned by Dioxin in 2004 and Galina Starovoitova, the most prominent pro-democracy Kremlin critic, was shot in 1998 . He had been serving as the vice chair of the group known as the 'Kovalev Commission' which was formed to investigate charges that Putin's KGB had planted support for the war in Chechnya. July 2003: Yuri Shchekochikhin, a vocal opposition journalist and member of the Russian Duma and the Kovalev Commission contracted a mysterious illness. Witnesses said he complained about fatigue, and red blotches began to appear on his skin. They said: 'His internal organs began collapsing one by one. Then he lost almost all his hair.' June 2004: Nikolai Girenko, a prominent human rights defender, Professor of Ethnology and expert on racism and discrimination in the Russian Federation is shot dead in his home in St Petersburg. July 2004: Paul Klebnikov, editor of the Russian edition Forbes magazine, was shot and killed in Moscow. Forbes reported that at the time of his death, Paul was believed to have been investigating a complex web of money laundering involving a Chechen reconstruction fund and the Kremlin. Former spy Alexander Litvinenko (pictured) was killed in 2006, leading to a clouding of relations between London and Moscow. September 2004: Viktor Yushchenko, anti-Russian candidate for the presidency of the Ukraine, was poisoned by Dioxin. September 2006: Andrei Kozlov, First Deputy Chairman of Russia's Central Bank, who strove to stamp out money laundering was shot and killed in Moscow. November 2006: Former spy Alexander Litvinenko was killed in 2006, leading to a clouding of relations between London and Moscow. The 43-year-old had been an officer with the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB, but he fled to Britain where he became a fierce critic of the Kremlin. October 2006: Anna Politkovskaya, author of countless books  exposing Russian human rights violations in Chechnya and articles attacking Vladimir Putin as a dictator was killed in Moscow. She had written: 'I have wondered a great deal why I have so got it in for Putin. What is it that makes me dislike him so much as to feel moved to write a book about him?' January 2009: Stanislav Markelov, a human rights lawyer, was shot after leaving a news conference less than half a mile from the Kremlin in January 2009. He was appealing the early release of Yuri Budanov, a Russian military officer convicted of killing a young Chechen woman. July 2009: Leading Russian human rights journalist and activist Natalya Estemirova was abducted in front of her home in Grozny, Chechnya, taken across the border into Ingushetia where she was shot and dumped in a roadside gutter.","Opponents in fear of a wave of political assassinations after death threats .

"From Russia With Love may be the name of a popular James Bond film, but it could also be used to describe the experience basketball superstar Lauren Jackson had when playing for Spartak Moscow and taken under the wing of the club's controversial millionaire owner Shabtai von Kalmanovic. In fact the James Bond similarities don't end there as Von Kalmanovic was an ex-KGB spy turned businessman who had spent five and a half years in an Israeli prison after he was convicted of spying for the Soviet Union. From 2007 to 2009 Jackson played for Spartak on a multi-million dollar contract. Her loving benefactor would also shower the Australian basketball player with expensive gifts and get her everything she could wish for. Scroll down for video . Australia's Lauren Jackson (left) is one of the world's best female basketball players . Jackson was Australia's flag-bearer at the 2012 London Olympics . But her friendship with the possessive Von Kalmanovic gradually turned into an oppressive partnership. “My experience there, the lifestyle, it is beyond belief to most people,” Jackson told the Sunday Telegraph. From the outside she looked to be living a charmed existence with Von Kalmanovic showering Jackson with diamonds when she played well. She would fly the globe on his private jet. And that was just for starters. She'd a personal driver and lived rent-free in a luxurious six bedroom apartment. The Russian millionaire even flew in singer Kelis to help celebrate one victory. But Von Kalmanovic's smothering obsessiveness took it's toll. Suddenly Jackson had no control whatsoever over her life. Her Russian boss was calling all the shots. Spartak Moscow owner Shabtai von Kalmanovic and Jackson kiss the trophy as they celebrate their victory in the Euroleague Women's Final Four decider in 2008 . Moscow's Red Square would have been very familiar to Jackson who lived in a rent-free luxury six bedroom apartment in the city . It seemed that it was only while playing on the basketball court that she could make her own decisions. It was a strange and at times startling period of her life. At one time Von Kalmanovic’s security detail started following her and other Spartak players through a local mall after a game. 'He was even wearing a trench coat,' Jackson says. 'Shabtai said it was for our own protection.' Von Kalmanovic would shower Jackson with expensive gifts and once bought her diamonds when she played well . The kind of world Von Kalmanovic was involved in couldn't have been made any clearer though when in November 2009 he was shot dead in Moscow, . It was a professional hit. Two men just drove up beside Von Kalmonvic's luxury Mercedes and riddled the vehicle with bullets, in what The Guardian reported at the time was a classic assassin's tactic. Jackson was devastated by the loss. But for all the riches that had been given to her she felt empty inside. She had a lavish lifestyle but something was missing. Now all she wanted was peace and quiet. She moved back to Canberra where she now lives the quiet life. The glitz and glamour of Russia couldn't be further away. Jackson had a personal driver in Moscow and lived rent-free in a luxurious six bedroom apartment . The 33-year-old is hoping she will be fit to play for Australia in next year's Rio OIympics after being her country's flag bearer for London 2012 . Last week the 33-year-old - who plays for the Seattle Storm in the US - had her sixth knee operation in the last 12 months, but despite this she still wants to play for Australia at next year's Rio Olympics. Her shimmering record includes playing in four Olympic Games and winning three silver and one bronze medal, according to basketballaustralia. Olympic gold has remained an elusive dream. But whatever the future holds its her time living and playing in Russia that has made an indelible mark on her. And she believes she is all the better for the experience. Jackson is currently recovering from injury and has had six operations in the last 12 months .","From 2007 to 2009 Jackson played for Spartak Moscow in Russia .

According to Natika, the bullying wasn't just happening at school.'They hacked into her email and they created a Facebook page and they massacred her.' Bird said she had tried to discuss the situation with Clark County School District police. 'The school police told me because it was not on school campus and after hours, I needed to call the regular police. The regular police told me, 'You need to call the school police,'' she said. Eventually it got to the stage where Carla couldn't handle it anymore and she hung herself. Parents in similar situations need to contact every school administrator available advised Bird. 'You go as hard as you can, and at the same time let your kid know that this is not their fault,' she said. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help the family with funeral expenses.

"Since the Sound of Music holidaymakers from around the world have wondered what it would be like to spend a night in a convent. They could soon find out as a historic Italian convent has been put up sale in Tuscany with planning permission to transform it into a impressive hotel or conference centre. Although the sale price of £13million (€18million) may seem  steep, it is a bargain price as Giaccherino has 50 bedrooms, 40 bathrooms, a church and a library. A convent, more than 80 times the size of the average UK home, has been put up for sale for the price of a three-bedroom flat in London . Giaccherino, in Tuscany, boasts a staggering 50 bedrooms, 40 bathrooms, a church, a library and even an olive grove . The huge estate has 78,000 square feet of accommodation, which is 85 times the size of the average new home in the UK. The magnificent 15th century property also comes complete with an olive grove, cloisters, beautiful wall frescoes and a vast woodland which covers nearly 22 acres. There is even a colourful history to go with the Giaccherino, which became a valuable centre of theological studies during the 17th century. The holy dwelling was originally used for a community of Franciscan friars of the Primitive Observance. On completion of the property in 1414, Pope Innocent VII handed the property to the monks and over the years it has been used as an oratory and hospital for pilgrims. Giaccherino became a valuable centre of theological studies during the 17th century and has two cloisters with stunning frescoes . The property is listed with the Sotheby's International Realty as an opportunity for one of the most impressive private homes in Europe, or as a possible hotel or conference centre. Fulvio Biagioli, sales manager at Tuscany Sotheby's International Realty, said: 'This convent is of real historical significance and any private buyer would have to have a strong passion for restoration and history. 'The original frescoes offer a once in a lifetime opportunity to live amongst the works of the Florentine masters and the olive groves and land could be turned into some of the finest private grounds in the country. 'If a private individual was to buy the convent they could create one of the most incredible private homes in the world.' Outside there is an olive grove that is positioned at the bottom of the property and there is a private, 22-acre woodland . The price indicates just how powerful the London housing market is, as the convent is just £500,000 more than a penthouse apartment in the new Galliard development, Chilterns, in Marylebone. David Galman, sales director at Galliard Homes, said: 'It always boils down to location, location, location. London is the best city in the world for a whole number of reasons. 'You can have the penthouse, or you can spend the £13million on a castle or convent in Italy. 'But in five years the convent will be worth the same or less, while the penthouse will be worth more.' The Italian property could become one of the most impressive private homes in Europe or be transformed into a hotel or conference centre .","An historic convent in Tuscany is up for sale for the price of a three-bedroom penthouse in Marylebone .

"This terrifying dashcam footage captured the moment that a doctor rushing to work caused a 50mph head-on smash. The 10 second video caught the instant the medic pulled her Toyota Aygo straight out into the path of an on-coming Citroen Picasso. The front seat passenger of the Picasso suffered whiplash after driver, Colin Kay, 72, was left unable to avoid the impact. The doctor, who has not been named, was airlifted to hospital after being cut free from the twisted metal but fortunately escaped serious injury. A dashcam captured the terrifying moment that a medic rushing to work caused a 50mph head-one smash . At the start of the short clip Mr Kay's Piccasso can be seen travelling along the road at 50mph. Just as the vehicle approaches a junction, the white Aygo traveling in the opposite direction turns right directly into his path. The accident took place on the A586 Great Eccleston bypass at St Michael's on Wyre in Lancashire, in August last year, but details have only just emerged. 'It is a miracle that no one was more seriously hurt given that it was a serious head-on smash at 50mph, said Mr Kay . 'I had very little time to brake because she turned right in front of me due to a lapse in concentration. 'I feared the worst afterwards because she was trapped in her vehicle but thankfully she was not badly hurt, and was cut out by the Lancashire Fire and Rescue. 'My wife and I were protected by airbags and were okay, too. All the emergency services were brilliant at the scene.' The medic initially denied liability but was caught out because Mr Kay had captured the whole incident on his SmartWitness dashcam. The retired engineer, who has had a clean driving licence for 50 years, bought a Smartwitness dashcam because he wanted to be able to produce evidence in the unfortunate case he was involved in a car crash. The smash was captured on the dashcamin the Citroen Picasso belonging to Colin Kay, who has had a clean driving licence for 50 years . The medic pulled her Toyota Aygo straight into the path of the on-coming Citroen Picasso . Mr Kay said he did not have time to react and avoid an impact with the white coloured Toyota Aygo . Both cars were written off as a result of the crash, but fortunately no one was seriously injured . 'She was rushing to work in the morning when the accident happened,' he said. 'I contacted the police because I was keen to see a full prosecution to stop more careless driving. 'But nothing has been done because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time. 'The only way our roads are going to become safer is when motorists driving carelessly like this are punished. 'My wife and I were very lucky that we were not more seriously hurt and we have very disappointed that no police action has been taken in this case.' Mark Berry, SmartWitness sales director, said: 'This accident perfectly shows the value of our cameras. The mangled wreckage of Mr Kay's Citroen Picasso after the 50mph impact in St Michael's-on-Wyre, Lancashire . 'You have a collision where one driver is very clearly at fault but initially is disputing liability. 'I very much doubt that her insurers would have settled so readily if they had not been presented with the SmartWitness footage. The camera never lies.' A spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: 'Officers attended the scene and carried out a thorough investigation. 'An accident report was submitted with a recommendation for the driver to attend a Drivers' Alertness Course. 'Unfortunately the officer in the case was off sick and the report was not processed within the allocated time frame for prosecution.'","Medic rushing to work caught on camera driving into path of oncoming car .

"As if preparing for fatherhood second time around wasn't challenging enough, Prince William has also started a new job. The Duke of Cambridge, 32, has officially started work with the company that operates the East Anglian Air Ambulance service. He's now working for Bond Air Services, which runs air ambulance and police aviation operations and is training so he can start flying rescue missions in the summer. Scroll down for video . Former RAF pilot Prince William has started training for his new role with Bond Air Services . The Duke of Cambridge, pictured here during a visit to south London on Friday with the Duchess of Cambridge, will start his job barely a month after becoming a father for the second time . Kensington Palace said in a short statement: 'The Duke of Cambridge has today started work as an employee of Bond Air Services. 'Over the coming months he will undertake job-specific training before he begins piloting missions for East Anglian Air Ambulance during the summer. 'The mandatory training will involve simulator, aircraft and in-flight skills training.' William has begun work a few weeks ahead of the birth of his second child and is likely to take paternity leave, as he did for his first child Prince George, who was born in July 2013. A spokesman for Bond Air Services would not discuss the length of the leave the Duke could receive but added: ‘Like other pilots, he will be entitled to paternity leave.’ He said: ‘He has come to do a job as a professional, a pilot, and we’re very happy he’s going to be a pilot.’ William poses in front of a Sea King helicopter at RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales, in 2013 after finishing his tour of duty as a RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot . William passed his Air Transport Pilot's License exams in March, completing 14 written exams on subjects including the principles of flight and navigation. The second-in-line to the throne will work with medics responding to emergencies ranging from road accidents to heart attacks. The stint will be William's main job, although he will also continue to take on royal duties and engagements both in Britain and overseas. His new role was announced shortly after he touched down in Tokyo for a seven-day tour of Japan and China in February. The Duchess of Cambridge joins William, resplendent in his RAF uniform for The Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 . It's thought that he, the Duchess of Cambridge and their two children will relocate to Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The Grade II listed Georgian pile has reportedly undergone a £1.5million refurbishment, with the driveway re-routed and new trees planted to offer the family more privacy. The prince has completed seven and a half years in full-time military service after beginning his career with the Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals) and later served with The Royal Air Force, with his final posting as an RAF Search and Rescue Pilot. The royal left operational service in the Armed Forces in September 2013. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: 'Shortly before departing for Japan and China, The Duke completed and passed his Air Transport Pilot's Licence exams, which he required before starting work as an Air Ambulance Pilot.'","Prince William started new job with Bond Air Services today .

"Angela Swann is still suffering illness now, a year after contracting illness on a dream holiday . A woman who fell seriously ill on a £13,500 trip of a lifetime to Africa is still taking medication a year later. Just days after arriving in Zanibar, Africa, Angela Swann and Andrew Smith say they were infected with gastric illnesses, which they say ruined their longed-for break. The pair were confined to their rooms for three days when they suffered diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea during the week-long, all inclusive stay at the Hideaway of Nungwi Resort and Spa in March last year. And today, as the pair instruct expert lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to look into their case, they have told how their holiday was ruined. Angela, a nurse from Gosforth, Newcastle, said: 'We just couldn't keep anything down. 'We just thought it was a 24-hour bug. 'But as soon as we were eating we had to go back to the villa. We were just very ill and weak. 'It totally ruined the holiday of a lifetime. 'We both came back suffering from really bad symptoms and it's left us with an illness we have never had before.' The holiday was part of a two-week Under The Serengeti Skies tour arranged through Kuoni, which began on March 15 last year. Both Angela and Andrew, a service manager for Mercedes Benz, took antibiotics which they had taken on holiday with them as a precautionary measure and, following their return to the UK, they also sought treatment. Angela saw a private medical specialist and also had blood tests taken and an ultrasound scan due to the severity of her illness problems. And now - nearly a year on - she says she still feels ill. She added: 'This was supposed to be a holiday of a lifetime which we would treasure forever, but sadly when we look back now we only think of the turmoil we've been through. 'I was not happy about some of the food served as on occasions it was undercooked and I had to send it back. A £13,500 holiday of a lifetime turned into a living hell for  Angela Swann and Andrew Smith who say they were infected with gastric illnesses . A holiday to Zanzibar that should have left a couple with lovely memories, has instead left them in turmoil . 'Also sometimes some of the food served did not appear fresh and some of the food on occasions did not appear hot enough. 'Following falling ill, our holiday was ruined and was utterly embarrassing to say the least. 'Now, we just want answers as to why we fell ill, so that we can begin-to move on from what we've been through.' Nichola Blackburn, the legal expert in Irwin Mitchell's International Personal Injury Law team who is representing Angela and Andrew, said: 'We are conducting investigations into what was the cause of the illness Angela and Andrew suffered from. The couple's week stay at the all-inclusive stay at the Hideaway of Nungwi Resort and Spa turned sour after the pair fell ill . 'As we conduct our investigations we would urge anyone who stayed at the Hideaway of Nungwi Resort and Spa and who may be able to provide information about the conditions there to get in contact with us as soon as possible. 'Sadly, their story of working and saving to afford a luxury break only for the holiday to be ruined by serious illness is an unfortunate one, and understandably such issues have left Angela and Andrew frustrated and desperate for answers regarding the illness they have suffered. 'Kuoni have denied liability and we are seeking to establish what caused them to fall ill.' A Kuoni spokeswoman said: 'Kuoni take any claims surrounding the health and well-being of our customers very seriously indeed. We are aware of this case, which is currently with our legal team and continues to be under investigation so it would be inappropriate to comment further on this particular incident at this stage.'","Angela Swann and Andrew Smith say they were hit with gastric illnesses .

"A stunning collection of images taken by a wildlife photographer have revealed what life is really like in the animal kingdom. From pouting penguins to nosy orangutans, Sean Crane has captured a wide range of creatures, travelling from India to Uganda and Croatia to observe them in their natural habitat. Alongside candid photographs of the animals are others of Mr Crane, whose 'day job', as he describes it is as an advertising executive, working alongside conservationists. In addition to travelling to every continent to capture images of exotic animals, the photographer from Connecticut also spent a year driving around the U.S. to visit those closer to home. The gallery of animal portraits below was taken in the rainforests of Indonesia, Madagascar and Borneo, home to some of the planet's most endangered species. Also featured are squawking penguins on the Falkland Islands and regal cheetahs as they roam across conservation parks in Kenya. A bearded piglet poses for a portrait in Borneo. The species is the only native wild pig on the island and is typically found in its rainforests . A diademed sifaka hangs upside down form a tree in Madagascar, its yellow and grey fur unmissable from a distance. The species is critically endangered with very few of its kind found at one time . A red bellied lemur hugs a tree in Madagascar, its bright brown eyes opened wide for the portrait. The animal can normally be found foraging at all levels of the rainforest . A black and white ruffed lemur hugs a tree in Madagascar. The animal is easily recognised by its wide amber eyes. It is rarer than its counterpart, the red ruffed lemur, also found in the island's rainforests . A surprised looking leaf-tailed gecko opens wide for the camera in Madagascar. It is considered the smallest species of gecko in the world with adults typically measuring between three and six inches in length . A nosy orangutan stretches out towards Mr Crane's camera in the  Tanjung Puting National Park in Indonesia. The species is threatened by rapid deforestation across South East Asia . A Black Crested Macaque bares its fangs for the camera in Tangkoko National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Black crested macaques are critically endangered with an estimated 5,000 remaining in the wild . A dough-eyed deer is taken by surprise as it finds a quiet spot to rest in the Madagascan wild. As well as dense rainforest there is an abundance of wildlife in the island's drier patches . An angry Rockhopper penguin squawks towards Mr Crane's lens at the The Rookery on Saunders Island, one of the Falkland Islands . A lazy Juvenile Northern Elephant Seal looks woefully down the camera as it rests on washed up reeds on a beach in central California . A sad looking baby  sea lion on the shores of the Galapagos Islands. The species is classed as vulnerable because it can mostly only be found on the archipelago . Looking menacingly at the photographer's lens, a marine iguana clutches onto salty rocks for his portrait in the Galapagos Islands. Its grey and blue scales are the perfect camouflage in its dark and watery habitat . A juvenile Southern Elephant Seal takes in the view at Carcass Island on the Falkland Islands. Males weight eight to ten times what females do - the largest weight difference between sexes in the animal kingdom . A proud cheetah poses calmly for this extraordinarily close-up portrait in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya. The vast wildlife park is home to 10 of the species alongside rhinos, lions and birds . Mr Crane helps as a mother orangutan grooms her young in the Borneo rainforest. The photographer has travelled to all seven continents to capture exotic wildlife in its natural habitat . The advertising executive also travelled the U.S. and lived out of the back of his car to compile one gallery.

"Like many professional athletes, Tiger Woods has decided to move into the hospitality industry with a huge new restaurant set to be opened this year. But it appears to have already hit a speed bump, with project developer Nicholas Mastroianni revealing it cannot be named 'Tiger Woods' because Nike owns the rights to the golfer's full name. He made the claims when asked in an interview about the Florida project's clunky name - The Woods Jupiter: Sports and Dining Club. Tiger Woods is unable to name his restaurant after himself because Nike owns the rights to his name, the project developer has claimed . In an interview with Golf.com, he said he was told that 'Nike has the rights to the name Tiger Woods', adding that even gaining permission to use Woods' name in a press release was 'over the top'. However, Woods' manager Mark Steinberg has contradicted the claims, saying Nike does not own the rights to his client's name. He said: 'I can't imagine how this could have been communicated this way. It is wholly inaccurate and categorically false', golfchannel.com reported. 'Tiger owns his own name and always had.' A Nike spokesperson supported this, denying the corporation owned the rights to the name Tiger Woods. Developer Allied Capital and Development of South Florida previously said the property is expected to be a 5,900-square-foot restaurant, likely to open in early 2015. Woods said he envisions 'a place where people can meet friends, watch sports on TV and enjoy a great meal. 'I wanted to build it locally where I live and where it could help support the community.' The restaurant will be located in a new shopping center development called Harbourside, which is set to open in full in October. The $150million development will feature an amphitheater, marina, restaurants and shops and Woods says he's had his eyes on the property for two years. Mr Mastroianni said: 'I couldn’t be more excited to have Tiger’s new establishment operating within Harbourside Place,' the Palm Beach Post reported. 'It’s gratifying to see the final stages met with support from local, national and international organizations such as Mr Woods.'

"Police are hunting for a 'bra bandit' who has allegedly stolen more than $14,000 worth of Victoria's Secret products from a Pennsylvania store. The unknown suspect has hit the Wyoming Valley Mall branch of the women's lingerie chain five times in the past 12 months, according to the Times Leader. However, there appears to be no clear CCTV footage to identify the underwear-loving criminal. In the latest heist, which took place on Saturday morning, a dozen bras were apparently taken from a rear display unit valued at $500. Scene of the crime: The unknown suspect has hit the Wyoming Valley Mall branch (pictured) of the women's lingerie chain five times in the past 12 months, according to the Times Leader . The alleged crimes date back to March 2014 when the Victoria's Secret store manager reported $4,014 worth of clothing had gone missing. It was unknown when the merchandise was stolen. Then, in July, 75 bras valued at $4,200 were reported stolen from the same store. Everything went quiet until this year when 94 bras valued at $4,166 were reportedly purloined from a display case on February 17. Just over a week later, on February 26, the store manager reported 39 bras valued at $1,773 had disappeared. The value of the looted merchandise adds up to $14,653. In each of the thefts there was no clear suspect description provided by store security.","The unknown suspect has hit the Wyoming Valley Mall branch of the women's lingerie chain five times in the past 12 months .

"One of Britons' favourite places to visit in North Africa has been named the world's top destination by TripAdvisor users. With its desert landscape and bustling souks, Marrakech came out on top in the website's annual Travellers' Choice Awards for the first time. It finished ahead of Siem Reap in Cambodia and Istanbul in Turkey, which finished second and third, respectively. London missed out on a spot in the top five, finishing sixth. Scroll down for video . Marrakech came out on top in TripAdvisor's annual Travellers' Choice Awards for the first time . Hanoi, Vietnam and Prague, Czech Republic rounded out the top five. Some results were surprising, as New York failed to make the top ten for the second year in a row. Traditional holiday destinations in North America and Western Europe were trumped by cities or resorts in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe. London ranked sixth in TripAdvisor's study, behind Hanoi, Vietnam and Prague, Czech Republic . 1. Marrakech - £60.272. 2. Siem Reap - £37.71 . 3. Istanbul - £71.66 . 4. Hanoi - £27.06 . 5. Prague - £57.83 . 6. London - £162.25 . 7. Rome - £86.72 . 8. Buenos Aires - £63.21 . 9. Paris - £114.34 . 10. Cape Town - £77.21 . The awards from the world's largest travel review site judge destinations on a worldwide scale, in Europe and in the UK. Siem Reap in Cambodia leaped in the ratings from last year, gaining seven places to take second place. In fourth place, Hanoi offered the cheapest hotel rooms at under £30 a night. Last year's runner-up, Rome,  slipped five places to take seventh place. London similarly slipped from third to sixth place, although it is only one of three cities which have secured a top ten spot five years in a row. 'The competition among global tourist destinations has never been tougher,' said TripAdvisor spokesperson James Kay. 'A combination of low average booking rates and fantastic traveller reviews on TripAdvisor has helped Asian, African and Eastern European destinations steal a march on old favourites like New York and Rome.' New York, one of the world's most visited cities, failed to crack the top ten for the second year in a row . Steve Jackson, TripAdvisor's top contributor of photos in 2014, said: 'Marrakech is one of those cities that should be on everyone's bucket list. 'It's a fantastic city to explore, rich in history and culture, and between the sea of street activity, bright colours and striking sunsets, it is a truly intoxicating experience.' In the UK it was the northern cities that took the top spots, taking eight of the ten best rated UK destinations. Blackpool, famed for its tower and beach, had the cheapest hotel room rate out of the UK's top destinations . Despite London being named the best UK city, Llandudno and Torquay beat rivals Liverpool, Belfast and York. Lake District's Keswick featured in the top ten for the first time beating Glasgow. Blackpool, in sixth place, had the cheapest hotel room rate in the top ten at £76.21, less than half the rate for a similar room in London.","Marrakech has been rated the world's best destination for the first time .

"France's ruling Socialists suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections last night - as three years of left-wing rule was branded a 'massive failure'. Exit polls showed Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition UMP party controlling up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists. This meant a loss of 30 of the regional councils for Francois Hollande's party, which came to power nationally in 2012. Scroll down for video . France's ruling Socialists under Francois Hollande (pictured) suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections last night - as three years of left-wing rule was branded a 'massive failure' Even the Correze department - Mr Hollande's home turf in the south west - was won by the UMP. Former president Mr Sarkozy said: 'Tonight, the Republican right, and the centre, has won the departmental elections.' Referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments.' Mr Sarkozy said 'three years' under the most outdated Socialist party in Europe had brought the country to its knees, and the electorate had had enough. Exit polls showed the opposition UMP party under Nicolas Sarkozy (pictured) controlling up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists . 'A new era is starting. Hope is reborn for France,' said Mr Sarkozy. 'The road will be long and hard, but change is coming and nothing can stop it.' Also highlighting the 'failure' of the Socialists, was the far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen. Although the FN was expected to win up to one department maximum, they were on course to win more than 200 seats on regional councils. Calling on Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, 'to resign', Ms Le Pen said her anti-immigration and anti-Europe party had a huge part to play in the future of France. Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, conceded 'incontestable' electoral defeat soon after the polls closed at 8pm. Far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen (pictured) also highlighted the 'failure' of the Socialists . Noting increased extremism in his country, Mr Valls said: 'Far-right gains in local elections are a sign of lasting change in the French political system'. The election will choose 4,108 local councillors and - crucially - shape the political landscape in the run-up to the 2017 presidential race. The vote was also a key test for Mr Sarkozy who, despite a series of corruption scandals, is convinced he can return to power in two years' time. According to the exit polls, the UMP and its centrist allies could end up with nearly twice as many seats as President Hollande's Socialists.. Yesterday represented the Socialists' third political battering in a year - they were roundly beaten in municipal and European elections last May.","Exit polls have shown Nicolas Sarkozy's party controlling 70 departments .

"Twitter is reportedly looking at ways to make money by selling people's tweets to other companies. These firms, known as 'data miners', would use the content in the tweets to personalise services from advertisers and marketers online, as well as in the real world.

Twitter’s data strategy chief Chris Moody (pictured) said the data could also be used by police to gauge the mood of a football crowd, for example . Many websites and services already sell data to third-parties in this way, but Mr Moody wants to expand its potential. He gave one example of a grandparent travelling on a plane to see their newborn grandson. The airline would know of their impending trip from their tweets and when they arrive they would greet the user by name. Twitter's boss recently admitted the social network 'sucks' at dealing with trolls and now the site is making good on its promise to clamp down on these abusive accounts. Reports claim the site will start banning users who violate its rules by tracking  email addresses and phone numbers. It also recently added new tools to make it easier for users to report abuse and send these reports to law enforcement. A gift-wrapped rattle would then be on the user's seat. 'You bring your data to us and we will ensure that your customers, if they exist on Twitter - we can provide advertisements to them,' explained the 48-year-old. 'Twitter gives this fascinating ability to understand people in context like we’ve never been able to do before.' He stressed that this would be done anonymously and no private information is shared. Plus, unless tweets are protected, they can be searched for and viewed easily already. As a result there are firms that have developed their own mining software to extract information from tweets.

"The amount of local geography required to operate a New York City yellow cab has been significantly reduced as organizers claim they are modernizing the test and critics claim they are making it too easy for prospective drivers. Cabbies have traditionally faced a rigorous set of geography questions on the 80-question test they must pass to get a license, but now only ten geography questions remain that have to do with navigating the city with a map. The Taxi and Limousine Commission says GPS technology means divers don't need to learn so much information about getting from A to B and the revised exam can focus more on safety issues. The amount of local geography required to operate a New York City yellow cab has been significantly reduced as organizers claim that GPS technology means they simply don't need it . Spokesman Allan Fromberg told The New York Times that the revised test is 'catching up to the times.' However the changes come just as the commission is facing a shortage of drivers as many prospective candidates apply instead to driver for alternative services such as Lyft and Uber that don't bother to test local geography. The change to the test was introduced several weeks ago and there has since been a 20 percent increase in the pass rate. The companies who operate fleets of yellow cabs are happy to have more drivers to rota onto shifts, but users are unhappy that they might have a driver who doesn't know their way around the city. Lifelong New York Carolyn Baker told the Times that she has been taking cabs for more 50 years. 'If I got into a cab and the driver didn't know where Penn Station was, that'd be ridiculous,' said . Yellow cab services are experiencing a shortage in the number of drivers as prospective candidates flock to alternative services such as Lyft and Uber . She also voiced concerns about being driven by someone who was too busy looking at their GPS to focus on the road. 'I don't want the driver using GPS while they are driving and put my life at risk,' she said. Using a GPS device when a cab is not standing or parked is currently prohibited. Half of the 80-question test, 30 questions on English-language proficiency and the 10 on map reading, remain unchanged. Of the remaining 40, up to 25 questions previously covered geography, but now they all cover rules and regulations. 'The chance that a licensed cabdriver is not going to know where major tourist attractions are is slim to none,' said Fromberg.","The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission says GPS technology means divers don't need to learn so much info about getting from A to B .

"It has been claimed they are not on speaking terms, even when it comes to their daughter Suri, aged eight. Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise - who divorced in 2012 after six years of marriage - 'have bad feelings about each other,' according to a Wednesday report from TMZ.

"For most boys, China would seem the ideal place to go to school. Just days after football was officially added to the national curriculum in a bid to win the World Cup, the country's air force has announced plans for Top Gun-style training for pupils as young as 14 to develop tomorrow's fighter pilots. A total of 16 senior high schools have been enlisted as 'Air Force Teenager Aviation Schools', according to the People's Daily Online. Sky-high dreams: A team of 77 pilots aged 18 and over recently took to the skies for the first time in a five-hour flight training demonstration at one of the air force's existing junior flying schools . Aspiring face: These teenage pilots have been trained by elite from Chinese Air Force while maintaining academic studies - as the new younger recruits will be . Off you fly: Each student conducted two flights, logging around 80 minutes of time in the air . The news came as China's air force released pictures of its current intake of 18-year-old trainee pilots being taught at its junior flying school. The new 'Top Gun' schools that will give training to boys aged 14 and up will be located in 15 cities across China, including regional capitals like Wuhan and Changsha, and will be chosen based on their previous performance and the level of support they are able to get from local government. The judging body is formed by representatives from the Ministry of Education of China, the General Political Department and Air Force. All schools are regular senior high schools that offer mainstream academic courses. Cream of the crop: The students were selected from senior high schools around the country . Learn to fly: The students have to complete 18 hours' training in basic aviation theory as well as 28 hours of pre-flight study and one hour in a flight simulator . Lead the world: Officials from the Air Force said China had decided to step up its game because major powers in the world all invest heavily in training pilots from young ages . We want you: The poster of China's Teenage Aviation School programme . Special 'Aviation Experimental Classes' will be set up in these Teenage Aviation Schools, which plan to recruit 1,000 students every year. A class is usually made up by 30 to 50 students in China. This means there will be approximately 20 to 30 teen pilots classes every year. These classes are jointly managed by the schools and Air Force recruiting authorities. Male teenagers between 14 and 16 years old from all over China can apply before September 1, the start of an academic year in China. Once accepted, successful candidates will be given meal and living allowances, a rare exception for students in China. Scholarships will also be offered to the cream of the crop. These teen pilots will be taught under the programme for three years before entering the University Entrance Examination in China for a chance to further their studies in aviation universities in the country. While news about Teenager Aviation School has just been released, People's Daily Online published a gallery of a team of trained Chinese teen pilots taking to the skies. These 77 students, who are aged around 18, were selected from senior high schools around the country to receive Air Force training at junior flying schools. Start them young: The country is endeavouring to provide pilot training among young male pupils in senior high schools . Large-scale recruitment: Besides specialised air force schools, regular senior high schools are to set up experimental classes to train young pilots . In their first public flying demonstration recently, these teen pilots carried out five hours of real-equipment flight training. The training took place at a air base in Changchun, provincial capital of Jilin in northeast China. Shi Yansong, one of the teen pilots, said though their training followed a quasi military standard, he felt he still had much to learn from their commanders who were Air Force elite. Unprecedented showcase: This was the first time China had arranged real flight training for teen pilots . Ready for take-off: Shi Yansong, one of the teen pilots in the flying training, said it was his dream to become a pilot in the future . Air base: The training took place in Changchun in northeast China . 'Flying a jet feels so amazing,' said Shi, 'I must become a real pilot in the future.' As China's first batch of training pilots who maintain regular academic studies, the teenagers' flying debut is a landmark on the history of China's teenage aviation education, commented People's Daily Online. Peng Junxia, head of China's Air Force recruiting bureau, told Chinese media that the junior flying schools were established because major powers in the world all invest heavily in training pilots from young ages. In addition, China hopes such schools can raise a large number of outstanding Air Force commanders in the years to come. Big occasion: Students and trainers take part in the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the military training demonstration .

"Divorcée Linda Walker Zevallos starting dating the real estate heir for six months 15-years-ago . A woman who dated millionaire murder suspect Robert Durst 15-years-ago revealed she ended their relationship after she 'sensed something was wrong.' Divorcee Linda Walker Zevallos starting dating the real estate heir, who she described as a 'good listener,' after meeting him on flight between New York City and Dallas. Durst made no mention of the unsolved disappearance of his wife and instead told the mother-of-one he was a labor lawyer with two daughters who both attended Harvard University, she told NBC News. During their six month relationship in 2000 Ms Zevallos visited his Dallas apartment that had bizarre concrete flooring. She also introduced Durst to her 13-year-old son. '(Durst) was nice when I was with him, pretty much,' she told the news channel. 'But if he didn't get his way, then he was a little mean. But then he'd turn around and apologize later.' She told how he had kept guns in the back of his car and had even once kicked her under the table when she ordered the same entree as him. Ms Zevallos said Durst also confided in her that he would have to make a trip to visit Susan Berman who having 'problems.' Durst, who is worth an estimated $100 million, was arrested in New Orleans last weekend . She ended their relationship due to his 'eccentricities' before Berman was gunned down at her home in Beverley Hills on Christmas Eve 2000, she told NBC News. But when she heard of the Berman murder she said: ' A light bulb went off - oh my.' Durst, 71, was sensationally acquitted of the 2001 murder of neighbor Morris Black and has long been suspected of killing his first wife, Kathie, and then murdering long-time friend Susan Berman. He was shockingly caught on tape saying 'I killed them all,' at the end of the HBO documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst. Durst, who is worth an estimated $100 million, was arrested in New Orleans earlier this month, shortly before the finale of the series aired. Police believe he was preparing to flee the country as he was found in a hotel room with a latex mask, false ID, a loaded Smith & Wesson .38 caliber revolver with one spent shell casing and $42,000 in cash. Robert Durst and his first wife, Kathleen, who went missing in 1982. She has never been found . A small amount of marijuana was also discovered. He is now on suicide watch as he awaits trial in Louisiana on gun and drug possession charges and extradition to California to face a murder trial in the Berman case. Susan Berman's death has been linked to Durst . But as new interest has been aroused in Durst, he finds himself linked to cases in at least four states . In an exclusive interview with MailOnline yoga teacher Allison Modafferi urged Durst to be honest with police if he knows anything about what happened to her sister, honors student Kristen Modafferi. 'If he — or anyone — knows anything, please come forward so we can have some answers,' pleaded Allison, who is expecting a daughter in June. 'It's been nearly 18 years so as a family we would welcome anything that could put our minds at rest,' she added. 'We hope that one of these days we will get some answers as to what happened to Kristen.' Kristen disappeared from San Francisco in 1997. Oakland Police now say there is no hard evidence to suggest that Durst was involved, even though he was living in the city at the time. Eureka Police Department in California has said they want to probe links between Durst and 16-year-old Karen Marie Mitchell, who vanished after leaving her aunt's store in 1997. Durst had reportedly visited the aunt's store dressed in drag. Durst, who is worth an estimated $100 million, was arrested in New Orleans. The family of Kristen (right) want him to help end their agony . In 2003, Durst was acquitted of murder after he admitted to killing a neighbor in self-defense, dismembering him and throwing the body parts in Galveston Bay, Texas. He admitted that he had shot neighbor, Morris Black, in the defense but that his actions were self-defense. At the time, Durst was living as an odd and mute woman, named Dorothy Ciner. He also has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen McCormack, in New York.","Linda Walker Zevallos met murder suspect Robert Durst on a flight .

"Hillary Clinton has been accused of deleting all her emails while under subpoena. The allegation, leveled by a Republican chairman for a House committee on Benghazi, is the latest in a series of claims that are hammering the former First Lady's reputation as 2016 approaches. In a letter released on Friday night, Rep Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said the former Secretary of State has failed to produce a single new document in recent weeks and has refused to relinquish her server to a third party for an independent review. Clinton's attorney, David Kendall, rubbished the claims. Scroll down for video . The latest: Hillary Clinton (left), a likely Democratic candidate for 2016, wiped all her emails from her server while under subpoena, according to Benghazi committee chairman Trey Gowdy (right) on Friday night . Clinton, a likely Democratic presidential candidate, faced a Friday deadline to respond to a subpoena for emails and documents related to Libya, including the 2012 attacks in a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to   Libya. The Benghazi committee demanded further documents and access to the server after it was revealed that Clinton used a private email account and server during her tenure at State. House Speaker John Boehner has not ruled out a vote in the full House to force Clinton to turn over the server if she declines to make it available by Gowdy's April 3 deadline. In a six-page letter released late on Friday, Kendall defended Clinton, saying she had turned over all work-related emails to the State Department. That included everything sent or received during her tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. 'The Department of State is therefore in possession of all Secretary Clinton's work-related emails from the (personal email) account,' Kendall wrote. Kendall also said it would be pointless for Clinton to turn over her server, even if legally authorized, since 'no emails ... reside on the server or on any backup systems associated with the server.' Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Benghazi panel, said Kendall's letter confirmed 'what we all knew: that Secretary Clinton already produced her official records to the State Department, that she did not keep her personal emails and that the Select Committee has already obtained her emails relating to the attacks in Benghazi.' Dispute: The claims come as the former Secretary of State defends her use of a private email system . No take two? Analysts warn the saga could have a devastating affect on Clinton's approval ratings before the 2016 Presidential race, which could hamper her chances of a second White House stint with husband Bill . Cummings said it is time for Gowdy and other Republicans to stop what he called a 'political charade' and instead make Clinton's emails public. Gowdy also should schedule Clinton's public testimony before the Benghazi panel as soon as possible, Cummings said. Kendall said in his letter that Clinton's personal attorneys reviewed every email sent and received from her private email address — 62,320 emails in total — and identified all work-related emails. Those totaled 30,490 emails or approximately 55,000 pages. The material was provided to the State Department on December 5, 2014, and it is the agency's discretion to release those emails after a review. Kendall said Clinton has asked for the release of all of those emails. He said the State Department is reviewing the material to decide whether any sensitive information needs to be protected. 'Secretary Clinton is not in a position to produce any of those emails to the committee in response to the subpoena without approval from the State Department, which could come only following a review process,' Kendall wrote. Gowdy said he was disappointed at Clinton's lack of cooperation. 'Not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server, ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest,' he said. In a statement released later Friday, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said she 'would like her emails made public as soon as possible and ... she's ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the American public.'","Republican chair of Benghazi committee leveled allegations on Friday .

"A two-year-old boy will receive revolutionary treatment for his rare disease after a mystery benefactor donated £40,000. Kat Musgrove had 30 days to find £140,000 so her son Kian could fly to the U.S and have his neuroblastoma treated. She was struggling to raise the final bit of money until an anonymous donor from Luxembourg stepped in. Kian Musgrove, two,  will receive revolutionary treatment for his rare cancer after a mystery benefactor donated £40,000 . Neuroblastoma is the cancer of specialised nerve cells, also known as neural crest cells. It is the second most common childhood tumour. The symptoms range from tiredness to lack of appetite and pain in the bones. Most children who are diagnosed with the condition are younger than five years old. Treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and antibody treatment. Almost half of neuroblastoma cases are an aggressive form and, despite very intensive treatment, it has a high chance of returning. It affects around 100 children every year. The 27-year-old, from Newcastle, said: 'I can't believe it. There was a note with the money saying ""good luck to your son"". 'I still can't get my head around it. I keep looking to make sure the money is actually there.' Kian will fly to Michigan for the treatment on March 31. He was first diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma on October 31, 2013, after doctors discovered 27 tumours around his kidneys and in his bones. Despite chemotherapy and numerous operations Kian still had an 80 per cent chance the cancer would return, doctors said. The new trial treatment - called DFMO - aims to prevent the cancer returning by stopping a certain cell that creates the neuroblastoma cell. His mother Kat (centre) had just 30 days to find £140,000 so Kian could fly to Michigan and have the trial treatment. Above, with sister Katie (left) Kian was first diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma on October 31, 2013, after doctors discovered 27 tumours around his kidneys and in his bones . But it has to be started no later than 120 days after the patient has undergone their last bout of immunotherapy - and Kian's finished almost 100 days ago. Ms Musgrove, who is in the process of booking her flights, said: 'I'm so excited by what has happened, people have just been incredible. 'I want this for Kian so much and I want this to work so badly. 'But I'm also scared. Scared because I'm flying over there alone, not knowing what the future is going to hold.' Kian's family will continue to raise £500,000 for 'relapse therapy' in case the trial treatment does not work and the cancer returns. Above, mother and son are pictured together before the trip . His family will continue to raise  £500,000 for 'relapse therapy' in case the trial treatment does not work and the cancer returns. Ms Musgrove added: 'I just hope this works for my little boy.'

"A fraudster escaped from one of Britain's most secure prisons by forging his own bail letter. Neil Moore duped wardens into believing he had been given bail by Southwark Crown Court before brazenly walking out of Wandsworth jail in south London where he was being held for a £1.8million fraud. The 28-year-old employed 'extraordinary criminal inventiveness, deviousness and creativity' to secure his release from the Category B jail from which notorious Great Train robber Ronnie Biggs escaped in 1965. Neil Moore escaped from HMP Wandsworth - one of Britain's most secure prisons - by forging his own bail letter . Southwark Crown Court heard his plan included setting up an official-looking email address with the name of the detective in charge of the fraud probe involving British and American crime agencies. After escaping  Moore spent three days  securing a new driving licence - but handed himself back in after having a change of heart. Ian Paton, prosecuting, said: 'Having been remanded into custody by this court and realising the reality of what he had lent himself to and what was going to be uncovered, he promptly began adapting his skills for deceit, forgery and dishonesty and engaged them for his escape.' In spring last year Moore set about using a mobile phone illegally smuggled into HMP Wandsworth to organise his release. He set up an email domain imitating Her Majesty's Court Service that used hyphens instead of 'dots' to say Southwark Crown Court had rubber-stamped his bail on March 10, 2014. Moore managed to secure his release when staff failed to spot the subtle difference - despite Southwark being misspelled 'Southwalk'. Mr Paton said wardens discovered he had escaped when Moore's solicitor turned up for a meeting. He said: 'Mr Moore's solicitor had attended at HMP Wandsworth to have a conference with his client only to find that he had been ""granted bail"".' Southwark Crown Court heard the 28-year-old's plan included setting up an official-looking email address with the name of a detective involved in the fraud probe . With the help of the United States Department of Homeland Security they discovered Moore, who is originally from Trinidad and Tobago, had set up a website offshore. He used the name Chris Soole, a Scotland Yard Detective Inspector, to set up the domain. Mr Paton said: 'He promptly set in process the obtaining of real, genuine documentation in order to get a further identity. 'It was the first stage of securing documentation that could have secured his escape from the jurisdiction.' The court heard Moore, from Ilford, Essex, had at least four different aliases and police were unsure of his precise identity. He pleaded guilty to escaping from lawful custody and eight counts of fraud. Moore posed as bank staff from Barclays, Lloyds and the Bank of America to fool large companies in the UK and US, including Thomas Exchange Global, into handing over around £1,819,000 between February 2012 and November 2013. Great Train robber Ronnie Biggs escaped from the same prison in 1965 . He utilised his talent of being able to impersonate female voices to dupe employees into believing they were talking to different callers. Mr Paton said: 'Much of this defendant's fraud consisted of him on a telephone speaking with a male voice and no less effectively and persuasively with a female voice.' His impersonations were so good his transgender civil partner became a fellow suspect in the fraud, the court heard. It took analysis by a top forensic voice expert to discount Kristen Moore, who was part-way through her reassignment at the height of the fraud. Moore often fooled firms into believing he was calling from their bank with concerns that their accounts may have been hijacked by criminals. He pretended to work for the fraud teams in the Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of America and Bank of New York. After carefully researching the firms and banks he would convince his targets into handing over bank details or transfer funds into 'safe' accounts that were under his control. Moore's elaborate deception finally began to unravel in July 2012 when he was arrested in a hire car in central London. He was quizzed about CCTV footage showing him withdrawing large sums of cash from banks in east London and large deposits from the firms he defrauded. Although his victims recouped the funds some were left so fearful of further frauds that they viewed investigators with suspicion, the court heard. Mr Paton said: 'Such was trauma that even when the officer visited them with his identification they still did not trust him. Even emails from the Metropolitan Police Service were viewed with suspicion.' Judge David Hunt adjourned the hearing until April 20 when he will hear mitigation.

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have brutally murdered at least 30 civilians, including two children, following a raid on a regime-held village. The Sunni extremists carried out a savage attack on the village of Al-Mabujeh in the central Syrian province of Hama earlier this morning, according to a monitoring group. ISIS 'executed at least 30 people, including women and children, by burning, beheading, and firing on them' in the village of Mabujeh, said Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Terror: The Islamic State militants (pictured) carried out a savage attack on the village of Al-Mabujeh in the Syrian province of Hama earlier this morning, according to a monitoring group. At least 30 people were killed . The Al-Mabujeh massacre took place earlier this morning as ISIS militants launched a massive offensive in the area, beginning near the Youth Housing Camp. The attack began at around 2.30am and saw multiple checkpoints come under attack before the jihadis managed to seize control of the National Defense Force positions at around 6.45am, according to Al-Masdar News. From there it is understood the militants set about massacring the local population. The attack comes just days after a video released by ISIS showed its bloodthirsty fighters cutting off the heads of eight men it claimed were Shiite Muslims. That video is also understood to have been filmed in the province of Hama. In the video, the men, wearing orange uniforms with their hands tied behind their backs, were led forward in a field by teenage boys. They were then handed over to a group of IS fighters. A boy wearing a black uniform hands out knives to the fighters, who then behead the hostages. Sick: The attack comes just days after an ISIS video showed children taking centre stage in the latest beheading video, which was also filmed in the province of Hama . An ISIS fighter speaks in the video, using a derogatory term for Shiites and calling them 'impure infidels.' He adds that the current military campaign against ISIS will only make the militant group stronger. 'Our swords will soon, God willing, reach the Nuseiries and their allies like Bashar and his party,' the man said referring to Syrian President Bashar Assad and Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group that is fighting on his side. The word Nuseiry is a derogatory term to refer to Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The news comes as the Observatory and local activists said Syrian government forces fired carried out airstrikes and fired surface-to-surface missiles  on the rebel-held city of Idlib, killing at least 14. The attacks come amid fears that the government is preparing to retake the city that it lost on Saturday. Smiling: A young boy is seen cheerfully handing out knives to each one of the masked fighters during last week's sickening filmed beheading in the province of Hama . Idlib, with a population of around 165,000 people, became the second provincial capital to fall to the opposition after Raqqa, which is now a stronghold of the Islamic State group. Its capture by several factions led by the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front underscores the growing power of extremist groups in Syria, which now control about half the country. Yesterday Canadian legislators voted to back the government's plans to bomb ISIS positions in Syria, a move that opposition parties say threatens to drag Canada into a long war. The Canadian House of Commons approved the plan 142-129. The result was never in doubt, since the ruling Conservatives have a majority in the chamber. The vote also approved the extension of Canada's six-month mission by a year to the end of March 2016. Canada has around 70 special forces troops in northern Iraq and six Canadian jets are taking part in U.S.-led bombing attacks against Islamic State in Iraq. Gruesome new images have emerged showing Islamic State militants stoning a blindfolded and bound man and woman to death in Iraq after they were accused of having sex before marriage. Taken in the ISIS-stronghold of Mosul in Nineveh province, the shocking images show a large crowd gathered to watch the jihadis murder the defenceless couple. Young boys clamber onto their fathers' shoulders to get a better view of the man and woman being charged with 'fornication', before the familiar white-bearded face of ISIS's elderly Mosul-based executioner-in-chief Abu Ansar al-Ansari orders their stoning to death. The sickening images begin by showing a large crowd gathered in a rain-drenched square in central Mosul. Stoned to death: Taken in the ISIS-stronghold of Mosul in Nineveh province, the shocking images show a large crowd gathered to watch the ISIS militants murder the defenceless couple . Accusation: An Islamic State militant with a yellow scarf covering his face is  seen using a microphone and PA system to read out the charge of 'fornication' -or sex outside marriage - against the couple . With heavily armed militants taking up positions on ledges overlooking the crowd, the young men and boys jostle to ensure they get the best view of the murder . In the background of the image, women wearing black niqabs are seen gathered together. An Islamic State militant with a yellow scarf covering his face is then seen using a microphone and PA system to read out the charge of 'fornication' against the couple, suggesting they have been accused of having sex without being married, not of committing adultery. A large pile of stones are then seen heaped in the middle of the road, before the barbaric ISIS militants began throwing them at the defenceless and blindfolded couple, who have had their hands bound to prevent them getting away. As stones rain down on the victims' bodies, large pools of blood appear in the road, before eventually the man and woman die of their injuries and the savagery finally comes to an end.

"A man accused of plotting to attack the U.S. Capitol called a television station from jail and said if he hadn't been arrested he would have gone to Washington and shot President Barack Obama in the head. WXIX-TV in Cincinnati said Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, called the station from the Kentucky jail where he's being held, confessed to being a supporter of the Islamic State group and said he planned to kill government officials in retaliation for U.S. strikes on the militant organization. The station aired part of the interview on Friday night, hours after Cornell's attorney argued unsuccessfully in court that it could violate the defendant's right to a fair trial. Scroll down for video . Christopher Lee Cornell allegedly plotted to attack the U.S. Capitol in Washington and kill government officials inside it and spoke of his desire to support the Islamic State militant group . Cornell, asked by the interviewer what he would have done had he not been arrested in January, said he would have taken one of his guns, 'I would have put it to Obama's head, I would have pulled the trigger, then I would unleash more bullets on the Senate and House of Representative members, and I would have attacked the Israeli embassy and various other buildings.' Cornell, who repeatedly identified himself as Muslim, said he wanted to carry out the attack because of 'the continued American aggression against our people and the fact that America, specifically President Obama, wants to wage war against Islamic State.' He said: 'They might say I'm a terrorist, but you know we see American troops as terrorists as well, coming to our land, stealing our resources and killing our people, raping our women.' Cornell, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, grew up in the Cincinnati suburbs and still lived with his parents. He said support of the Islamic State group is widespread. 'We're here in Ohio. We're in every state,' he said. 'We're more organized than you think.' WXIX-TV in Cincinnati said Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, called the station from the Kentucky jail where he's being held, confessed to being a supporter of the Islamic State group and said he planned to kill government officials in retaliation for U.S. strikes on the militant organization . He said that if he hadn't been caught, he would have attacked, President Barack Obama, the Senate, the House of Representatives and many other places in the nation's capital . Cornell, who repeatedly identified himself as Muslim, said he wanted to carry out the attack because of 'the continued American aggression against our people and the fact that America, specifically President Obama, wants to wage war against Islamic State' At times what seemed like a nervous chuckle punctuated his responses. He said he would do whatever the Islamic State group asked of him, including beheading Americans, and predicted 'there will be many, many attacks'. A federal indictment charges Cornell with two counts that carry possible sentences of up to 20 years each upon conviction: attempted murder of government employees and officials and solicitation to commit a crime of violence. He also faces a firearms-related charge. He has pleaded not guilty and awaits trial in Cincinnati. Cornell was arrested outside a gun shop near his home on January 14 after the FBI said he bought two M-15 assault weapons and 600 rounds of ammunition. The FBI said in court documents that Cornell planned to 'wage jihad' by attacking the Capitol with pipe bombs and shooting government officials and employees. Cornell was coerced and misled by 'a snitch' trying to better his own legal situation, his father said. Cornell warned the news station that there were Islamic State group supporters in almost all of the United States . Cornell was arrested outside a gun shop near his home on January 14 after the FBI said he bought two M-15 assault weapons and 600 rounds of ammunition . He described his son as a 'mommy's boy' who spent hours playing video games in his bedroom. He also said his son was 'at peace' after becoming a practicing Muslim. 'He was dragged into this,' Cornell said before the hearing. 'He was coerced.' His son had long expressed distrust of government and the news media, and local police said he disrupted a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013. The FBI said he had for months sent social media messages and posted video espousing support for Islamic State militants and for violent attacks by others. Cornell told an informant they should 'wage jihad,' authorities said in court papers. Similar stings in recent years have led to accusations of entrapment. But the FBI has argued such stings are vital for averting deadly terror attacks, and juries have returned tough sentences. Cornell (pictured left years ago) posted messages on Twitter sympathizing with Islamic terrorists led to an undercover FBI operation.

"A Spanish priest has been arrested after allegedly performing at least 13 exorcisms on an anorexic girl after her parents told him she was 'possessed by the devil'.

The ceremonies, which involved her being tied up with crucifixed placed on her head, left the girl injured - and at one point, she tried to commit suicide. But in December last year, Sahagún told El Mundo newspaper defended the exorcisms, adding he had performed more than 200 in the past four years. The archbishop of Burgos also spoken out last year, insisting the suicide attempt was not a result of the exorcisms.

Pope Francis made exorcisms an official Catholic practice in July last year. The Vatican, who hailed exorcism as a 'form of charity' formally recognised the International Association of Exorcists, a group of 250 priests in 30 countries who liberate demons from the faithful.

"Cab driver David Perry (pictured), 52, sexually assaulted two women who fell asleep in his taxi . A black cab driver who sexually assaulted young women who fell asleep in his taxi after nights out has been jailed for 10 years. David Perry, 52, attempted to rape his first victim and sexually assaulted the second after climbing into the back of his cab and removing the women's clothing while they slept, in separate attacks some 16 months apart. But Scotland Yard believe the cab driver of 25 years may have preyed on more women and urged potential victims to come forward. Judge John Lafferty said the victims had suffered 'serious psychological harm' as a result of the attacks as he sentenced the father of two to 10 years in prison and a subsequent five-year licence period at Snaresbrook Crown Court. The court heard how Perry told police after his arrest that he had been 'worried about what he might do' because of his high hormone levels after the break-up of a relationship and had sought help from his doctor. The women, in their 20s, were both heavily drunk after socialising in east London when they were assaulted in the early hours of the morning, the first attack in January 2013 and the second in May 2014. Prosecutor Peter Clement told the court that Perry was in a high position of trust when he took of advantage of the women. 'Both victims had been out with friends, both had been drinking and both were at the relevant time highly intoxicated,' he said. 'They were, by virtue of their drunkenness, particularly vulnerable. Their incapacity made them no less deserving than anyone else of being safe. 'They each sought the security and safety they were entitled to expect from a London taxi - a black cab. 'He exploited his passengers' obvious vulnerability for his own sexual gratification. One of the victims, who last remembered being in or around Commercial Road (pictured) in Shoreditch, woke to find herself without her trousers or underwear on and the driver lying beside her . 'Whilst each was asleep in what should have been the  safety of his black cab, he stopped, got in to the back of his cab and stripped and sexually assaulted each victim while they slept or were semi-conscious.' In the first attack, the court heard that the victim had been out drinking with friends since lunchtime but could not remember leaving Shoreditch House in Bethnal Green. The woman, who was not in court, said she woke up half-naked in the back of a taxi while the driver was performing a sex act on her. He then twice attempted to have sex with her but was unsuccessful. Perry was sentenced to 10 years in prison and a subsequent five-year licence period at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) She described being unable to focus or rationalise what was happening and was next aware of being at home, where she made a 'hysterical' phone call to a friend, recognising that she had been the victim of a serious sexual assault. It was not until more than a year later, when a second victim of a similar sex assault came forward, that police were able to track Perry down. The second victim, who last remembered being in the Commercial Road area of Shoreditch, woke to find herself without her trousers or underwear on and the driver lying beside her. The driver then dropped her home, where the woman raised the alarm with her boyfriend. She was able to give police details about the driver and his cab and officers trawled through CCTV which led to Perry's arrest. Detective Chief Inspector Samantha Price, from Scotland Yard's sexual offences unit, praised the victims for reporting the assaults and for their 'strength and determination' in seeing Perry brought to justice. She urged other potential victims to come forward. 'Perry was a taxi driver for some 25 years and I must consider the possibility he may have committed other offences that have not been reported to the police,' she said. 'As part of this investigation we have made detailed inquiries into his past and eliminated unsolved cases from this inquiry. 'I would now appeal directly to anyone who, as a result of this case, thinks they may have been raped or assaulted by Perry. 'I would like to reassure anyone worried about coming forward that they will be treated with the utmost sensitivity and specially trained officers will be available to listen to them and support them through each step.'","David Perry attacked two women in east London in two separate attacks .

"A woman who ate live frogs as a child had to have an 8cm-long parasite removed from her brain. Yin Meng, 29, had been complaining of headaches for six years when she keeled over at work. She was rushed into hospital in Zhaoyang County in south-western China's Yunnan Province. There, doctors discovered something growing inside her brain. Scroll down for video . Unaware: Yin Meng, 29, had an 8cm-long parasite growing inside her brain, which caused her to collapse . But they had no idea what it was or how to remove it so she was discharged. Yin then took medications to try and control the increasing number of headaches and seizures she was experiencing - before collapsing again. Her boyfriend Shan Tu, 30, said: 'I was getting increasingly worried about her as her fits and seizures were getting worse - and so too were her headaches. 'So when she collapsed again that was the last straw.' Yin was admitted to hospital and this time surgeons agreed to operate - despite the risk. During surgery, they removed the thin, 10cm-long white parasite. A hospital spokesman said: 'The woman was found to be suffering from a parasitic infection called Sparaganosis which had been growing inside her for years. 'It was attacking her nervous system.' Sparaganosis can be contracted by drinking contaminated water, or eating a carrier of the infection such as a frog or a snake. Danger: During surgery,  doctors removed the thin, 8cm-long white parasite (pictured). A hospital spokesman said: 'The woman was found to be suffering from a parasitic infection called sparaganosis' Harm: The parasite (pictured) was attacking Yin's nervous system, triggering seizures and headaches . It can also be transmitted through coming into contact with an open wound from the host. It most commonly affects the brain or the eye. Upon waking and being told about her condition, the patient immediately realised what had happened. 'She said that when she was a child, around five-years-old, she used to catch and eat live frogs with her grandmother, which must be how she contracted the parasitic infection,' the spokeswoman said. 'She said she could remember the feeling of the frog 'jumping' as it went down her throat. She added: 'The damage to her nervous system is quite extensive but we hope we can prevent it from being permanent as the brain has an amazing capacity to heal itself.'","Yin Meng had been complaining of headaches for years before collapsing .

"Jailed: Munir Hussain, 34, admitted driving while disqualified, dangerous driving, failing to provide a specimen and having no insurance . A convicted heroin dealer who led police on a high risk 20-minute chase and then deliberately rammed them has been jailed for almost a year. Munir Hussain, 34, of Brierfield, Lancashire, raced the wrong way down a dual carriageway and around a maze of residential streets as the pursuit was filmed from the sky. It ended when his tyres were punctured by a stinger and he crashed into a police car, sending one officer scrambling for his life. Burnley Crown Court heard that Hussain had been sleeping rough in his Ford Transit van and feared police were about to arrest him for being disqualified and uninsured. Hussain claimed he had been trying to start on a new life away from crime but the incident left him heading back to jail for a ten-month term. The court heard how police in a marked BMW X5 began tailing the van on January 24 - but it sped off, and they turned on their blue lights. Emma Kehoe, prosecuting, said: ‘Such was their concern, the police helicopter was deployed. The vehicle is seen, during the course of the pursuit, travelling onto the wrong side of the carriageway, travelling the wrong way up a dual carriageway at one point and on many narrow residential streets. ‘The vehicle is seen mounting pavements. The speeds vary. At some points the vehicle is travelling slowly, at other times it accelerates to beyond the speed limit. What is consistent throughout is it’s clear from the footage the van is well aware it is being followed by the police. ‘It refuses to stop for 20 minutes and in fact the only way the van is stopped is because a stinger is used. The defendant drove away and crashed into the police car, which was stationary.’ She added: ‘The officer is adamant he felt Mr Hussain’s vehicle was driven at the police vehicle on purpose. It’s clear the officer did feel that was the case as he describes himself as being terrified. ‘He tries to get from the driver’s seat to the passenger side, as the van is coming towards the driver’s side, but is not able to do that because of the speed of the van. ‘It then collides into the door of the police vehicle. He says he suffered whiplash as a result and had to go to the urgent care department.’ Miss Kehoe said when arrested Hussain smelled of alcohol but failed to provide a breath test. On the move: Hussain - who was driving a Ford Transit van (pictured) - raced the wrong way down a dual carriageway and around a maze of residential streets as the pursuit was filmed from the sky . Caught on camera: Police in a BMW began tailing the van but it sped off and they turned on their blue lights . Hussain admitted driving while disqualified, dangerous driving, failing to provide a specimen and having no insurance. He was also banned from driving for three years, when he must take an extended driving test. Richard Taylor, defending, said: ‘This offence was borne out of frustration and desperation. 'At the time he had nowhere to live and was sleeping in the back of a car. He had a new relationship with a girlfriend, who is in court and is supportive of him, and was determined to finish his old life of many drugs offences, drink offences and start a new life in Manchester. ‘Unfortunately, his means of doing that was flawed. He used a fairly elderly van and took a considerable risk in going to Manchester.’ Mr Taylor added: ‘He’s going to have to start all over again. He intends, as he has done in the past, to make the most of his time in custody.’ Judge Anthony Russell QC said: ‘The problem with offences of this nature is that, although, fortunately in this case nobody suffered serious injury, the fact of the matter is when driving of this nature occurs it’s very easy for people to become a victim when they don’t realise there is somebody dangerous coming along the road.’","Munir Hussain raced around  streets as pursuit was filmed from the sky .

"A member of the royal family was involved in a suspected paedophile ring, an ex-policeman has claimed. But investigations into the allegations were 'shut down for national security reasons', the former Metropolitan police officer said. The officer said he was told by fellow officers that both a royal and an MP had both been identified as part of a major child abuse inquiry in the late 1980s. A member of the royal family was involved in a suspected paedophile ring, an ex-policeman has claimed. But investigations into the allegations were 'shut down for national security reasons', the former Metropolitan police officer said (stock picture) He told the Sunday Mirror how a detective sergeant from Marylebone police station in London - who also named actor Oliver Reed in separate claims - revealed the investigation had been pulled for national security reasons. The source said: 'I was in a car with two other vice squad officers. They were discussing a madam who had provided a girl of about 15 to Oliver Reed. 'The detective sergeant said he had just had a major child abuse investigation shut down by the CPS regarding a royal and an MP. 'He did not mention names, but he said the CPS had said it was not in the public's interest because it ""could destabilise national security"".' The former Metropolitan Police officer said he was told by fellow officers that both a royal and an MP had both been identified as part of a major child abuse inquiry in the late 1980s . Sir Allan Green, Director of Public Prosecutions,  told the Sunday Mirror he he was not aware of any paedophile investigations shut down for national security reasons. He added that he'd been asked if he knew anything about an MP being involved in child abuse but he hadn't. The information has since been passed on to police. The news comes after it was revealed that Scotland Yard has been accused of facilitating 14 cover-ups of VIP child sex abuse. Dossier: Labour MP John Mann (pictured) last year submitted an explosive dossier to police naming 22 politicians linked to historical child abuse . Over 35 years, officers are said to have protected ‘untouchable’ figures by shutting down inquiries that reached the heart of government. The 14 alleged cover-ups were referred to watchdogs by the Metropolitan Police Service itself yesterday. It threatens to be the biggest investigation into police corruption since the 1970s. The allegations were uncovered by detectives probing claims of historical sex abuse first raised by Labour MP Tom Watson in October 2012. Those on the inquiry, known as Operation Fairbank, are understood to have raised concerns after studying files kept in storage. The claims include one that police deliberately stalled their inquiries into the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south-west London, leaving dozens of boys to be abused. Victims claim that high-profile politicians, diplomats and civil servants visited the property to abuse boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Officers are also accused of releasing paedophile MP Cyril Smith without charge after he was caught in an undercover operation at a sex party involving teenage boys. Police are also accused of failing to end sex parties at the now notorious Dolphin Square complex, in Pimlico, central London, following the intervention of ‘prominent people’. It is claimed that members of a wealthy and powerful elite believed they were ‘untouchable’ after police were warned off shutting down the sordid activities. One senior figure under the spotlight is former Tory home secretary William Whitelaw, who is accused of demanding that police drop an inquiry into a paedophile ring. The politician, one of Margaret Thatcher’s closest allies, is suspected of quashing a year-long investigation into a gang accused of abusing 40 children. Other inquiries focus on claims that the names of high-profile sex attackers were removed from witness statements and that police deliberately let senior politicians off the hook. One inquiry is examining allegations that Special Branch seized a dossier naming 16 MPs and peers handed to an investigative journalist by a former Labour minister. Paedophile: A detective says he was ordered to cover up Cyril Smith's crimes by senior colleagues . Unbelievably, two undercover officers are themselves suspected of sexually abusing a boy during a raid at the Elm Guest House. The IPCC is still considering two further cases, including the shadowy murder of eight-year-old Vishal Mehrotra in July 1981. His family believes he may have fallen into the hands of members of the VIP sex ring and evidence leading to their door was deliberately ignored. Sarah Green, of the IPCC, said police and her officials were examining claims that evidence was suppressed, investigations were hindered and halted and offences covered up. ‘These allegations are of historic, high level corruption of the most serious nature,’ she said. ‘Allegations of this nature are of grave concern and I would like to reassure people of our absolute commitment to ensuring that the investigations are thorough and robust.’ Defending the decision to ‘manage’ the Met inquiry, rather than undertake an independent one, she said: ‘The new criminal investigations looking at alleged police corruption are closely linked and well under way.’ Mrs Green said this decision remained under review and could be changed if new evidence came to light. Responding to the inquiries, Mr Watson said many child abuse victims will have mixed feelings but will be pleased that their voices are now being heard.","Officer said royal and MP both identified in child abuse inquiry in late 1980s .

"With this much hair to contend with, bathtime was bound to have an extra twist. And when Daz needed to look his best for dog show Crufts, which runs till Sunday, it was never going to be a case of just ‘wash and go’. Instead, an eight-hour clean-up operation ensued for the dread-locked Komondor — involving three hours in the tub, then five more under a vast array of dryers. Thankfully, placid Daz soaks up the attention as well as the suds. Locks like I need a bath: A pre-grooming walk relaxes the sprightly five-year-old Daz . Suds-u-like: Owner Julie does four-shampoos-and-rinse jobs, before a final conditioner is massaged in . It takes a lot of water to lather Daz up, according to his owner . The 10st 7lb five-year-old stands 33in to the shoulder and is one of around only 45 of his breed in the UK. Puppies, which cost upwards of £1,200, are born with downy coats that develop into dreadlocks (or, to be correct, ‘cords’). Komondors are known as ‘the ultimate sheep-dog’ in Hungary, their country of origin, where their thick, shaggy hair protected them from the wolves and bears which threatened farmers’ flocks. The cleaning process — at his owner Julie Branch’s dog grooming parlour — starts with Daz stepping into a hydrobath, which has a door for easy access. The first challenge is to get his dense coat wet enough. Miss Branch, 52, of Harlow, Essex, said: ‘It’s quite wiry and coarse, so it takes a lot of water before you can lather him up.’ Then its four shampoos and separate rinses before the conditioner goes on and a final rinse. A rubdown with a towel follows, plus a once-over with a ‘wet-and-dry’ vacuum cleaner to suck out as much water as possible. Then it’s out with the arsenal of hairdryers. They include a £300 X Power Airmover, which gusts cool air over Daz from its three large black hoses — and which is nicknamed ‘Octopussy’ by Miss Branch. ‘If we left him to dry naturally, it’d probably take up to four days,’ said Julie’s partner Barry Davison, 61, who runs a courier business. High and dry: A hurricane of blowdryers slowly gets the komondor's coat dried out . Finally, Daz slips into a fetching green onesie that helps keep his locks spotless and means he can carry on as normal until show day. Daz, whose pedigree name is Jabenezer Zolltan, will be at the Birmingham NEC today in the working and pastoral breeds section, where he has previously won Top Dog in the Komondor class. Needless to say, this year he’s hoping for a clean sweep of even more prestigious titles. On trend: A green onsie helps to stop a freshly blow-dried Daz picking up dirt like a damp mop .

"The family of James McNair, the comedian killed in the New Jersey Turnpike crash that also seriously injured Tracy Morgan, settled a wrongful death claim with Wal-Mart for a reported $10million sum. Denita and Jamel, McNair's children, will split the payout awarded for the June 7 accident that saw a Wal-Mart 18-wheeler hit a limo carrying Morgan and his friend. Their lawyer Daryl Zaslow will take a $3million cut, according to court papers. Scroll down for video . The family of comedian James McNair, (left and right) who was the mentor to 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan received a reported $10million payout from Wal-Mart . Denita and Jamel, McNair's children, will split the payout awarded for the accident on June 7 . Zaslow wrote that he was 'able to convince Wal-Mart' that the hefty settlement would outweigh any potential losses the conglomerate would face with a highly publicized lawsuit, according to a filing obtained by DNAinfo. He said the $10million settlement was a 'truly outstanding result,' especially because McNair's past income was not large enough  for his children to 'project a significant lost-wage claim'. According to DNAinfo, McNair, who was 62 at the time of his death, worked part-time at the Salvation Army when he wasn't doing stand-up gigs. The settlement was originally announced in January but the sum was undisclosed. Wal-Mart feared publicizing the large payout would negatively impact the superstore's business. But the amount was revealed in legal documents filed last month in Westchester Surrogate's Court. Denita, 19, wrote in an affidavit included in the filing that 'no amount of money could replace' her father, but that the settlement 'greatly exceeds anything I imagined and I could not be more grateful.' When the settlement was first announced in January, Zaslow said Walmart had 'accepted their responsibility' in the crash. 'They caused extensive damage to this family and more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family,' he said. 'Ultimately they did the right thing by the McNairs.' He added, 'No amount of money can replace what they've lost, but what they've got will take care of them and allow them to move forward, and their father would be happy for that.'

The settlement was originally announced in January but the sum was undisclosed. Wal-Mart feared publicizing the large payout would negatively impact the superstore's business . The settlement agreed between the McNair's and Wal-Mart allowed the superstore to admit no liability for the crash. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company and the family worked closely to reach an agreement and that Wal-Mart was working toward settlements with others injured in the accident. 'We know there is nothing we can do to change what happened to Mr. McNair,' Buchanan said. 'We will continue to work to conclude all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident and we're committed to doing what's right.' Kevin Roper, the truck driver, has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto for the summer crash in New Jersey. The police allege that Roper had been driving his vehicle for more than 24 hours before the fatal crash. In addition, an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Roper was driving up to 65 mph in a 45 mph zone just seconds before the crash. Morgan, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in the crash, has filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart. Morgan, a former Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock star, suffered a traumatic brain injury in the accident, according to his lawyer, and his lawsuit against Wal-Mart is proceeding in federal court .","James McNair, 62, died in car crash on June 7 after truck hit limo van .

"The man behind the highly anticipated expose on Scientology that is set to air this weekend on HBO is calling out the most high profile member of the church - actor Tom Cruise. Alex Gibney said in a recent interview he does not understand why Cruise has refused to comment on the numerous claims made against him and Scientology over the years, going so far as to call his silence 'irresponsible.' Among the claims featured in Gibney's documentary, Going Clear, are that Cruise allegedly tapped the phone of his ex-wife Nicole Kidman prior to their split and that he used underpaid workers for his own personal use that were supplied by the church. Scroll down for videos . Speaking out: Alex Gibney (above), the director of the Scientology documentary Going Clear, blasted Tom Cruise after a screening of the film on Monday . The film speaks to former members of the church, one of whom claims that Cruise asked the church to tap Nicole Kidman's phone during their marriage (above during one of their final appearances together) 'Cruise is the big kahuna and that's why we've gone to the trouble of calling him out,' said Gibney following a screening of the film earlier this week according to The Huffington Post. 'We believe that he has a responsibility to say something about the abuse.' He then said of Cruise; 'He can espouse his beliefs, that's fine. But not to address the allegations of abuse seems to me palpably irresponsible.' Mark Rathbun, who goes by Marty, makes some explosive claims about Cruise and current head of the church David Miscavige in Gibney's documentary. Rathbun, who was a top aide to Miscavige, claims that the church did not approve of Cruise's relationship with Kidman, and hoped they would break up once Cruise began to drift away from the church during their marriage. Then, while Cruise was away with Kidman in England working on the Stanley Kurbrick film Eyes Wide Shut, Rathbun claims the actor ordered the church to tap his wife's phone. Rathbun says he was shocked by this demand, but did as he was told. Rathbun, who also claims he was beaten and abused by Miscavige, did not say what, if any, information was obtained through the tapping of Kidman's phone, but the two did split just a few years later, at which time Cruise became a highly vocal supporter of Scientology. There are also claims in the film that church workers being paid less than a dollar an hour are used by Cruise to maintain his collection of motorcycles and his private plane.

'The accusations made in the film are entirely false and alleged without ever asking the Church,' said the Church of Scientology is a statement . 'The accusations made in the film are entirely false and alleged without ever asking the Church,' said the Church of Scientology is a statement. Neither Cruise or Kidman granted Gibney an interview. The church also ran an ad in January - just after the documentary had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival - which appeared in the New York Times, saying; 'The Church has documented evidence that those featured in Gibney’s film regurgitating their stale, discredited allegations are admitted perjurers, admitted liars and professional anti-Scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims. 'All have been gone so long from the Church they know nothing of it today. Yet Gibney and HBO stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the Church to offer relevant information about them, with more than 25 individuals with firsthand information eager to speak. 'To this day, neither HBO nor Gibney can deny that they have yet to present the Church with a single allegation from the film so the Church may have an opportunity to respond. 'The Church never sought special treatment, only fair treatment.' HBO meanwhile had a reported 160 lawyers watch and vet the documentary, which airs at 8pm this Sunday. Lawyers for the Miscavige dispute the claims that their client was ever involved in the tapping of Kidman's phone, that church workers are used by Tom Cruise to maintain his collection of motorcycles and his private plane and that Rathburn was 'beaten and abused' by their client.","Alex Gibney, the director of the Scientology documentary Going Clear, blasted Tom Cruise after a screening of the film on Monday .

Fashion photographer Christian Saint believes the tattooed model, likeSwedish Cleo Wattenstrom pictured here, will reign supreme in the future .

He set his sites on the tattoo community, using his experience as a successful photographer to help bring 'alternative' to the mainstream and his new book Tattoo Super Models celebrates this alternative kind of beauty. The compendium documents his work from 2007-2015, what he describes as his seminal years as a tattoo photographer. The women featured have incredible bodies, but it is the intricate artwork etched onto them that makes them interesting. A brunette shows off her head-to-toe designs as she poses in a cut-out swimsuit and striped sun hat. And a pouty blonde displays dozens of colourful designs on her arms, stomach and thighs whilst a vampy redhead shows off two 'sleeves' of sketches.

"Father-of-four Imran Sharif admitted brutally murdered his wife of 17 years in their kitchen before calmly heading off to work . A father-of-four  brutally murdered his wife of 17 years in their kitchen before calmly heading off to work, a court heard. Pharmacist Imran Sharif had dropped the couple's children at their schools before going home and slitting his wife Raheela Imran's throat. Leaving her dead on the kitchen floor, the 'violent and dangerous' 44-year-old changed out of his bloodstained clothes and hid them under the driver's seat of his car. He then stashed the murder weapon - which was never found - and went to work. Paramedics were called to the end-of-terrace home in Hillersdon, Slough on the afternoon of October 20 after Raheela's brother made the gruesome discovery of her body. He had gone round to the house after family members became concerned and found the front door ajar. A post mortem examination found the mother-of-four died as a result of a wound to the neck. Sharif was arrested later that day before being charged with murder on October 23. He had originally denied killing his 45-year-old spouse, but later confessed to a friend and fellow prisoner while he was being held in custody at HMP Bullingdon. Detective Chief Inspector Mike Lynch said: 'I am glad that Sharif has accepted responsibility for what he did and admitted that he took his wife's life. 'This has been an incredibly difficult time for Raheela's family and friends as they try to come to terms with their loss and although it may offer them little comfort, I hope that Sharif's guilty plea will be of some help as they begin to rebuild their family's lives.' Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, said Raheela's life had been 'brought to a premature end.' Raheela Imran's body was removed from her home in Slough after husband Sharif slit her throat last October . Forensic technologists had investigated at the semi-detached house where Mrs Imran lived with Sharif and their four children . Mr Foster said: 'Having been charged with his wife's murder and while on remand at Bullingdon Prison, Sharif confided in another prisoner, who he had known for about 12 years and admitted killing his wife. 'He is clearly an extremely violent and dangerous man. 'This case represents a tragedy for the family of Raheela. Her children, family and friends have been devastated by her untimely death. 'We have worked closely with Thames Valley Police since this investigation was launched and as a result of the hard work and diligence of the prosecution team, a just outcome has been achieved. A post mortem examination found the mother-of-four died as a result of a wound to the neck . Forensic officers leave the Sharifs' house in Slough where Mrs Imran was found stabbed to death . 'We know that nothing will bring Raheela back to her children, family and friends, but we hope that today's conviction brings them at least a small sense that justice has been done. Our thoughts are very much with them all at this time.' Sharif pleaded guilty to the attack at Reading Crown Court, which happened on October 20 last year in Slough, Berkshire and was remanded for sentencing on May 5. The family were originally from Pakistan but had lived in Slough for 12 years before the tragedy. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said after the murder last year: 'They were great people, it is really shocking.' A resident of neighbouring Bell Close said: 'I walk my dog around past the house and the kids were always outside playing, there were always lots of people running in and out. 'The children always came out and played with my dog. I really hope they weren't around to see anything.'

"Jamie Oliver has warned that a new trade deal with America will open the door to inferior food, including beef pumped up with growth hormones, banned additives and pesticides. There are also concerns that GM crops and food produced in the USA, which have not been through more strict vetting procedures in Europe, could be forced on to dinner plates. The campaigner and chef held talks this week with Business Secretary Vince Cable to outline his ‘massive concerns’ that the deal could seriously undermine British food and farming. Concerns: Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has held talks with Business Secretary Vince Cable about his worries that rules to protect food in the UK and Europe could be lost with a new free trade pact . Campaigner: TV chef Jamie Oliver has long been an advocate of quality food and ingredients and has expressed 'massive concerns' over the potential of a new trade pact with America . The EU and the US government are negotiating a new free trade pact – known as TTIP – which will lift barriers to trade in key sectors of the economy across the Atlantic. The deal will make it easier for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to access each other’s markets, affecting pharmaceuticals, cars, energy, finance, chemicals, clothing, food and drink. However critics like the chef fear it will expose British families to inferior food and drink which does not meet the higher health and welfare standards that exist in this country and Europe. For example, US farmers are allowed to pump up beef cattle, which are raised on vast factory farm feed lots rather than in fields, with growth hormones. Similarly, they are allowed to boost milk production with hormone injections. Currently, these are banned in Europe on the basis of health concerns for consumers. Britain has effectively banned the use of certain artificial colours from food for children because of an association with hyperactivity, however these are not banned in the US. American farmers can also use pesticides that have been banned in this country as a health risk. Balance: Business Secretary Vince Cable, pictured, told Jamie Oliver his fears were unfounded . However, all these protections could be swept away, according to Jamie and other critics of the TTIP proposals – Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – which is the biggest free trade deal in history. Writing on Instagram, the chef told followers he had been to see the Business Secretary ‘to tell him my massive concerns about any possibility of the UK’s and Europe’s Food standards being compromised’. He said: ‘We have fought long and hard to get where we are today and I really don’t want feed lot beef with growth hormones, nor chickens washed with chlorine or food produced with banned pesticides and additives, to name but a few, and I certainly don’t want our farmers undermined.’ Mr Cable and his officials reassured Jamie that his fears are unfounded, but he went on to say: ‘Food is still on the negotiating table and that does mean technically anything can still happen. ‘I’m glad they are aware of my concerns, but we must keep watching this space very very carefully.’ Wholesome: Jamie Oliver, pictured here for Jamie's Summer Food Rave Up, says he doesn't want 'chickens washed with chlorine or or food produced with banned pesticides and additives', allowed in the US . Beef: Most US beef cattle are fed with synthetic growth hormones to pump them up, boosting muscle. Beef from these animals was banned in Europe, including Britain, in 1989 amid concerns the residues were a cancer risk – particularly breast cancer - in humans . Dairy: Cows in the US are routinely given the synthetic hormone bovine somatotrophin, which dramatically boost milk production. There are raised levels of the hormone in the resulting milk. Milk and dairy products from the US were banned in the UK and Europe in 2000 because of concerns of a cancer risk to humans and evidence of harm to the cows. Chicken:Farmers in the US are allowed to feed antibiotics to chicken to speed up growth. This practice was banned in Britain and Europe in 2006 amid concerns it was leading to the emergence of superbug versions of dangerous infections, such as campylobacter and salmonella.Producers in the US wash chicken carcasses in a chlorine and water solution to kill bugs. This was banned in Britain and Europe in the 1990s because of concerns the residues were a cancer risk. Additives: Artificial colours - Tartrazine (E102); Quinoline yellow (E104); Sunset yellow (E110); Carmoisine (E122); Ponceau 4R (E124); Allura red (E129) – have been removed from virtually all foods/sweets/drinks aimed at children in the UK on the advice of the Food Standards Agency. This is based on concerns they are linked to hyperactivity and changes in behaviour.There are no such controls in the USA where these additives are commonly used in processed food, including breakfast cereals. Pesticides: 82 pesticides that are banned in the UK and Europe are allowed on US farms. These include Atrazine, which was banned here in 2003 because of evidence it was contaminating water supplies and can disrupt the human hormone system. It is still used intensively in the US or corn, sugar cane and many other crops. The US also allows the use of neonicotinoids. Two of these have been banned in Europe because they harm bees. GM:Many GM crops such as maize or corn and soya are grown on an industrial scale in the USA and appear in thousands of processed food products - everything from snacks to fast food, breakfast cereal, cooking oils and chocolate. These crops have not been subjected to the more rigorous safety assessments that apply in the UK and Europe. The British Government is one of the driving forces in the EU to get the new free trade deal approved. It claims TTIP could add £10billion to the UK economy, £80billion to the US and £100bn to the EU every year. It says shoppers would benefit by the removal of EU import tariffs on popular goods, such as jeans and cars. It’s also claimed that reducing regulation would help UK businesses export to the US, with small businesses in particular predicted to benefit. Importantly, it says restrictive markets would be opened up. For example, this might mean that a current block on exports of British lamb and venison to the US could be lifted. David Cameron has promised to put ‘rocket boosters’ behind talks to secure the deal, saying TTIP is central to his vision of a reformed competitive Europe. It is also supported by the Liberal Democrats. Labour, Ukip and the SNP broadly support the pact, as long as caveats are included to ensure protection for the NHS from private American corporations demanding they are allowed to tender for public health services. Plaid Cymru is more sceptical and the Green Party is strongly opposed. Once the deal is signed, US companies will be able to take governments in Britain and Europe to court if they feel their products are being unfairly kept out, which could involve huge financial penalties and compensation. The CBI business organisation is a major supporter of TTIP. Its director general, John Cridland, said: ‘This deal is vital for future growth and the prosperity for citizens across the EU. And could create thousands of new opportunities for our young people. ‘It would create an integrated market of over 800million people, bringing more choices for consumers at cheaper prices. And with the UK already trading more and investing more with the US than any other country, there are real advantages to drive home particularly for smaller firms.’ However, Adrian Bebb, senior Food Campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, said: ‘This trade agreement is a Trojan horse that promises jobs but will threaten our food safety, environment and farmers. This would mean more GM foods, pollution and factory farms – and less choice for citizens. The only winners will be the corporations that push industrially produced foods.’ A BIS spokesman said: ‘The British Government and European Commission have both been clear that food safety standards are not up for negotiation in TTIP and the high standards we enjoy in the UK will never be compromised. Removing unnecessary barriers to trade will benefit British exporters and consumers, and all food imports will continue to be subject to EU safety requirements.’","Worries GM crops and less vetted food will be forced on dinner plates .

"In a move that could heighten the hurdles faced by states attempting to execute prisoners, a leading association for U.S. pharmacists has officially discouraged its members from providing drugs for use in lethal injections. The policy adopted by American Pharmacists Association delegates at their annual meeting Monday makes an ethical stand against providing such drugs, saying they run contrary to the role of pharmacists as health care providers. The association lacks legal authority to bar its more than 62,000 members from selling execution drugs, but its policies set pharmacists' ethical standards. Execution chamber: The American Pharmacists Association has approved a proposal declaring that participation in lethal injection executions by compounding pharmacies would be a violation of core pharmacy values (file photo) Pharmacists now join doctors in having national associations with ethics codes that restrict credentialed members from participating in executions. 'Now there is unanimity among all health professions in the United States who represent anybody who might be asked to be involved in this process,' said association member Bill Fassett, who voted in favor of the policy. Compounding pharmacies, which make drugs specifically for individual clients, only recently became involved in the execution-drug business. Prison departments turned to made-to-order execution drugs from compounding pharmacies because pharmaceutical manufacturers refused to sell the drugs used for decades in lethal injections after coming under pressure from death penalty opponents. But now the compounded version is also becoming difficult to come by, with most pharmacists reluctant to expose themselves to possible harassment. Texas' prison agency scrambled this month to find a supplier to replenish its inventory before getting drugs from a compounding pharmacy it won't identify. Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark said Monday that he had no comment when told about the ruling. Concerns: Pharmacists now join doctors in having national associations with ethics codes that restrict credentialed members from participating in executions (file photo) After a troubling use of a two-drug method last year, Ohio said it will use compounded versions of either pentobarbital or sodium thiopental in the future, though it doesn't have supplies of either and hasn't said how it will obtain them. All executions scheduled this year were pushed to 2016 to give the state more time to find the drugs. Other states are turning to alternative methods. Tennessee has approved the use of the electric chair if lethal-injection drugs aren't available, while Utah has reinstated the firing squad as a backup method if it can't obtain the drugs. Oklahoma is considering legislation that would make it the first state to allow the use of nitrogen gas as a potential execution method. Fassett, a professor emeritus of pharmacy law and ethics at Washington State University, said the united front by health professionals might force people to finally face the death penalty's harsh realities. Lethal injections have created a sterile setting for executions, he said. 'It's like we're not really executing. We're sort of like taking Spot to the vet. We're just putting him to sleep, and that's not true,' he said.","The American Pharmacists Association has officially discouraged its members from providing drugs for use in lethal injections .

"Carl Cox driving an old banger, Norman Cook taking some time out in a fluffy towel and Danny Howard slipping into his PJs to catch the Coronation Street omnibus. These superstar DJs, they're just like us, you know. Cox, Cook and Howard are just three DJs who took time out of their hectic, jet-setting lives to share their more private passions with British photographer Jessica van der Weert for a charity exhibition raising awareness for the British Tinnitus Association (BTA) – an organisation that supports people with the debilitating hearing condition that affects almost 10% of UK adults and which affects many DJs. Pop culture photographer van der Weert has spent two years snapping her favourite music men and women, including Annie Mac, Zane Lowe, Paul Oakenfold and Mary Ann Hobbs, for the exhibition which is set to show in Berlin, New York and Ibiza this summer after a standout London debut (complete, of course, with an epic after party). Norman Cook - aka Fatboy Slim - is one of the DJs to be photographed by Jess van der Weert for charity exhibition Flipside . FlipSide, in association with art agents Beautiful Crime and Eddie Lock, combines van der Weert's two loves, music and photography, and is particularly a celebration of the dance music industry, bringing some of the world’s biggest techno, trance and house music DJs and producers out from behind the decks to reveal a rather more private side. While some works feature global music heavies in their other favourite places - Carl Cox doing burnouts in his Lotus, artist Goldie covered in paint in his studio - others feature the superstar DJs re-enacting their fantasies, such as Boy George dressed in full combat gear amidst clouds of purple smoke, re-enacting a scene from Platoon.

Car fan and global music phenomenon Carl Cox, 52, says: 'This is not a normal exhibition, this is a celebration of dance music, a collaboration between Jess and ourselves, and the images are personal, big, bold, colourful and fun.' Van Der Weert adds: 'Flipside is an intimate glimpse into the private lives of these global superstars. 'These are my favourite DJs and producers, responsible for bringing us so much utter joy and making life that much better. 'But it's not just about me having a great time with my favourite artists, Flipside has a serious aim too. Tinnitus is a condition that affects 8% of individuals and can ruin lives. As clubbers and DJs we are far more likely to be affected and so this worldwide exhibition aims to raise awareness of the condition, how to avoid it in the first place, and most importantly how to cope with it if you already have it.' Van der Weert says: 'it's not just about me having a great time with my favourite artists [such as Danny Howard, pictured here on the Coronation Street cobbles], Flipside has a serious aim too.'

"Royal Bank of Scotland provoked fury last night after handing out lavish bonuses – including an £859,000 windfall to its former boss. The State-backed lender’s annual pay report showed 110 staff received more than 1million euros (£720,000) last year, despite it racking up a £3.5billion loss. This marked its seventh consecutive annual loss since the financial crisis, when it was rescued with a £46billion bailout from taxpayers. Still on the books: Stephen Hester, left with a Warwickshire Hunt,  is set to pocket a £1million bonus from the Royal Bank of Scotland - one of around 70, £1million-plus, payments in 2014 . One of the biggest winners was former chief executive Stephen Hester, who pocketed £859,000 from a long-term bonus awarded in 2012. He handed in his resignation in June 2013, after being pushed out by Chancellor George Osborne. Last night the awards were branded ‘excessive’ and ‘unacceptable’, with campaigners criticising Mr Osborne for failing to stamp out fat-cat pay at RBS. To avoid a new pay row, current chief executive Ross McEwan waived his entitlement to a £1million fixed shares allowance introduced last year to bolster his basic pay package and dodge the EU bonus cap. This restricted his total pay for 2014 to £1.85million. Mr McEwan has also waived his £1million allowance for this year. But yesterday it emerged he could still receive up to £3.9million for 2015, including a long-term shares award of up to £1.6million that will pay out for several years. Warning: Boss Ross McEwan admitted it could be several years until taxpayers finally get their money back after seven consecutive losses . He will also receive a £1.5million ‘golden hello’ shares payment in August to compensate him for bonuses he forfeited when he left his previous job at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in 2012. Finance chief Ewen Stevenson received £3.1million last year, including a similar £1.9million ‘golden hello’ payment – this time for giving up for his old job at Credit Suisse. Last night Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee said the awards were ‘unacceptable’. He added: ‘Here is a bank that’s not doing very well that the taxpayer owns and has underwritten, so why should these few not very successful bankers get paid so much money?’ The boss of RBS’s so-called ‘bad bank’ also hit the jackpot as separate filings to the stockmarket revealed he received a £2million shares windfall yesterday. Rory Cullinan, who is responsible for getting rid of the lender’s most toxic loans, was among seven senior figures to pocket a total of £5.5million from bonuses awarded in previous years. The generous payout for Mr Cullinan is particularly sensitive as he is responsible for shrinking the investment bank. There are fears that up to 14,000 jobs could be at risk. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, criticised Mr Osborne for not doing more to curb pay at RBS, which is still 79 per cent owned by taxpayers. He said: ‘Ultimately pay deals need to be approved by shareholders, and at RBS that includes taxpayers. In the money: RBS, which is based in Edinburgh, pictured, has paid £7.6bn in bonuses since it was bailed out . ‘The Chancellor needs to be far more engaged in the process than he is now, and ask the board to justify these salaries. ‘Until the bank is able to stand on its own two feet, rather than being propped up by taxpayers, it should show more restraint on pay.’ Mr Osborne has admitted he made a mistake by not radically shrinking its investment bank when the Coalition came to office in 2010. He was convinced by the bank’s former management, including Mr Hester, that it could trade its way out of trouble. ‘I certainly regret that,’ Mr Osborne told the Financial Times. ‘I did what I could to correct it.’ Mr Osborne also said he would look to start selling off RBS as quickly as possible after the election, but admitted this could take years. Before the 2008 financial crisis, Royal Bank of Scotland was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world. The bank was founded in Edinburgh in 1727, but by the end of the 20th century it was a major player in the City of London too as the UK capital became the world's leading financial centre. RBS sealed its place at the top table of British banking in 2000 when it bought NatWest, which dates back to 1650 and was considered one of the 'Big Four' retail banks in the UK. Fred Goodwin, right, became chief executive of RBS the following year and pioneered a gung-ho expansion strategy with resources poured into its investment banking division. One of the biggest deals came when RBS joined a consortium to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro for £49billion, which was later revealed as a major overvaluation. With the advent of the 2007 credit crunch and subsequent global financial turmoil, RBS was exposed as being dangerously indebted and unable to meet its obligations. The Labour Government felt it had no option but to step in, and in October 2008 it took a 57 per cent stake in the bank in return for £37billion of new capital. As the bank's losses spiralled and it required even more bail-out money, the state share of the firm rose to 82 per cent. It is now at 79 per cent. Much of the blame for RBS's troubles was attributed to Goodwin, who was forced to resign and subsequently stripped of the knighthood he had received in 2004.","Former boss Stephen Hester is also set to pocket a £1m bonus from RBS .

"Reverend Gavin Ashenden said around 100 passages in the Muslim holy book incite followers to violence, including 'striking off heads' There are passages in the Koran which ‘invite people to violence’, one of the Queen’s chaplains said last night. Reverend Canon Gavin Ashenden, the former chaplain of Sussex University and one of 35 who serve Her Majesty, expressed concern about more than 100 passages in the Muslim holy book. But the Church of England priest declined to say whether parts of the Koran are ‘evil’, instead advising people to make up their own minds. He was responding to comments by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who warned this week about being too quick to brand people with strong religious views ‘extremists’. Yesterday, more than 60 imams and leaders of Muslim groups signed an open letter to the Government accusing it of criminalising Islam. They claimed the ‘terror threat’ was being exploited for political capital ahead of the election, as ‘the big parties inevitably try to outdo each other in their nastiness’. The signatories, which included journalist Yvonne Ridley and former Guantanamo detainee Moazzam Begg, criticised the ‘demonisation of Muslims in Britain ... despite their disavowal of violence and never having supported terrorist acts’. Rev Ashenden was responding to comments by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby who has reportedly claimed young people are turning to jihad because mainstream religion is not ‘exciting’. The Archbishop said Britain’s religious communities needed to do more to provide an alternative to extremism that gives youngsters a ‘purpose in life’. But Rev Ashenden told LBC radio he was ‘attracted to Christianity because it invites people to the extremity of forgiveness and love’. He added: ‘Islam has, I think, over 100 verses inviting people to violence in the Koran which Christianity doesn’t have. 'If you’re going to invite people to be dedicated ... followers of their scriptures, Christians will go around forgiving people and Islamists will do something else.’ Asked to compare the Bible and the Koran, he said the Christian holy text invites its followers to forgive and try to lead people away from sin, while the Muslim text invites people to violence . Presenter Iain Dale said Muslims would say Islam was ‘entirely peaceful’, but Rev Ashenden said parts of the Koran ‘tell you to kill your enemies’. He then quoted verses which he said urged Muslims to ‘strike off the heads’ of ‘those who disbelieve’. When warned his comments could offend Muslims, he said: ‘If they are offended by my quoting the Koran they are not offended by me, they are offended by the Koran.’ He added: ‘If you’re going to talk about excitement in Christianity it’s about delivering people from evil and transforming people’s lives.’ Asked whether he would describe certain parts of the Koran as evil, he said: ‘I notice that they invite people to violence. I’ll let other people decide whether that’s good or evil.’ The Church of England did not respond when contacted last night. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. Airlines which fly suspected terrorists out of the country in breach of a Home Office order could face fines of up to £50,000. The penalties would be applied to carriers which breach a ‘no fly’ instruction and allow a potential jihadi to travel abroad. Smaller fines of up to £10,000 could be imposed if airlines fail to hand over information about their passengers and crew. The new powers were rushed through the Commons on Tuesday night and are expected to come into force next month. Some 600 Britons are thought to have travelled to Syria or Iraq to join Islamic State. If police or security agencies are aware of someone’s intention to go to the region, an alert can be sent to airlines instructing them to prevent the person from flying. All airline carriers will be required to use data systems which automatically respond to these alerts. Schools cannot be expected to detect radicalised pupils if their own families do not spot warning signs, a senior Labour politician said last night. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt warned that ‘more and more’ responsibility is being placed on schools and teachers. He branded Islamic extremism a ‘poisonous and cancerous ideology’, which is ‘capturing the minds of many young people’. But he suggested that other public services, such as social work, had been stripped away, leaving schools to deal with the problem alone. The former TV historian spoke two weeks after three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in east London fled to Syria to join Islamic State. He said: ‘If the parents themselves didn’t know what was taking place, the chances of the teachers and the head teachers themselves knowing was more challenging.’","Rev Gavin Ashenden said some 100 passages in Koran incite violence .

"A southern California man who is thought to have carved his name onto his girlfriend's chest with a razor blade has been charged with kidnapping and domestic battery. Sergio Joaquin Mendoza, 25, from Santa Ana, is also charged with criminal threats and use of a deadly weapon after allegedly taking his girlfriend around in his car and repeatedly assaulting her. The pair had been renting a room from Mendoza's grandmother before he is thought to have demanded that she let him carve his first name onto her chest if she was going to leave the house last Saturday. Sergio Joaquin Mendoz, 25, from Santa Ana, faces more than 11 years in prison after allegedly carving his first name into his girlfriend's chest, not allowing her to leave the house and repeatedly assaulting her . Relatives told the couple, who had been in fights where the boyfriend allegedly threw punches over the previous week, to leave after the incident, according to the Santa Ana Police Department. The woman, who was never allowed to leave the house on her own that evening despite being cut with the razor, then suffered two days of brutal assaults. Her boyfriend allegedly drove her around to different parking lots. Mendoza is thought to have head-butted and tried to strangle his girlfriend while threatening her if she tried to leave the vehicle during the hours he stopped to sleep in parking lots. The victim was able to run away from the car on Monday the 23rd, and found shelter after running into a local business bleeding. The girlfriend was bleeding when she escaped from her boyfriend, ran to a local business and called 9-1-1 in west Santa Ana . She was taken to the hospital for treatment, according to police. It is also believed that Mendoza previously forced the woman to stay in the car when he was at work, according to the Orange County District Attorney's Office. The suspect was found in a relative's garage on Thursday. Mendoza is being held on $100,000 bail and faces 11 years and eight months in state prison. The boyfriend is charged with one count of felony kidnapping, one  count of felony criminal threats, two felony counts of domestic battery with corporal injury, and a sentencing enhancement for the personal use of a deadly weapon. He has pleaded not guilty and  is scheduled for a pre-trial hearing on April 8.

"A Masterchef contestant who built a restaurant in a hut in her back garden may have to pull it down after failing to get planning permission. Kathryn Minchew, who was a semi-finalist on the BBC show, set up a restaurant in a Finnish summer house in her back garden - but it has now got her in hot water with the local council. Now Mrs Minchew, who was a contestant on the show in 2008, may have to pull down the 'food hut' she opened at her home in Gloucester, because she did not secure planning permission. Scroll down for video . Masterchef semi-finalist Kathryn Minchew (pictured) may have to pull down the ‘food hut’ she opened in the back garden of her home in Gloucester because she did not secure planning permission . She opened her tiny 'Gloucester Studio' eaterie last November and it has proved popular with locals because of its intimate atmosphere. The restaurant features just two tables and opens for exclusive bookings and special events only. Built around a single hexagonal table it seats just six diners, who all sit across from each other on wooden benches that are covered in reindeer hide. A summer house was already in the garden when Mrs Minchew and her husband James moved in - but she did not realise she had to apply for planning permission to use it as a restaurant. But Gloucester City Council officials visited the restaurant and told her she must apply for if she has any hope of keeping it. Mrs Minchew opened her tiny 'Gloucester Studio' eaterie last November and it has proved popular with locals . The restaurant features just two tables and only opens for exclusive bookings and special events . 'When I first looked into building my studio, my builders and I believed that planning permission was not necessary,' she said. 'It was only at the end of the year that someone from Gloucester City Council contacted me. 'I immediately invited him to visit and he is satisfied about the business activity but he felt that contrary to my research, planning permission was needed. 'I don't think you can really take something like that personally and everyone I have been in contact with has been lovely.' Mrs Minchew's creation was inspired by a trip to Barcelona, where she visited a restaurant set in an apartment in the city. The restaurant was inspired by a trip to Barcelona, where Mrs Minchew visited a restaurant in an apartment . Mrs Minchew said her neighbours have so far been 'very enthusiastic' about the restaurant in her garden . She currently takes two bookings a month in her restaurant, set in a Finnish Kota hut, and said neighbours have so far been 'very enthusiastic' about the project. She added: 'I think what makes Gloucester Studio popular is that my customers get to enjoy an evening out that has all the benefits of a night in with friends but with someone else cooking, serving and washing up. While the menu constantly changes, a sample three-course menu, set at £35 per person, looks like: . A mug of mead to start. Butternut squash and Chinese mushroom soup with aubergine crisps. Beef bourguignon served with fire-baked potatoes and petits pois a la Francaise. Brandied fruits of the forest with brown sugar ice cream. Coffee. 'I've had lovely compliments about the food but what people seem to really love is how personal everything is. 'If any of the local residents have any objection to it they certainly haven't made comment to me. The neighbours I have directly spoken to were interested and enthusiastic.' Mrs Minchew made it to the penultimate round of Masterchef in 2008 but said she never had a desire to work 'in someone else's restaurant'. Martin Shields, Gloucester City Council's corporate director of services and neighbourhoods, said residents have until March 26 to give their comments on the hut. He said: 'We've written to residents in the area and invited them to send us their comments. 'If anyone else would like to give us their comments please visit gloucester.gov.uk and choose planning then search for 15/00288/FUL.'

"Why and how certain types of mushrooms glow has long confused scientists, but now they think they might have an answer. It appears that some fungi emit light to attract insects at night, which then spread their fungal spores around. And interestingly, the mushrooms are also able to sync up their ability with the circadian clock, so they only become bioluminescent when it is dark. Scientists in Brazil studied why certain species of mushroom glow. They found the ability helps them attract insects at night. These creatures will then move their fungal spores elsewhere. But the mushrooms are able to turn off the ability during the day. Pictured is Neonothopanus gardneri . The research, published in the journal Current Biology, was led by the University of Sao Paulo. Among bioluminescent organisms, fungi are the most rare and least understood. Of more than 100,000 species of fungi, only 71 are known to produce green light, a process that uses oxygen and energy. Scientists had thought they produce light around the clock as byproduct of their metabolism, but based on new evidence it seems that isn't so. The effect is triggered by a chemical reaction between luciferin, a light-emitting pigment, and the enzyme luciferase. It can occur in fungi as well as in a range of animals including jellyfish, squid, scorpions and other insects. In fact, the mushrooms' glow appears to be under the control of a temperature-compensated circadian clock. This level of control helps them 'save energy' during hours of daylight when they do not need to grow. At night, the green glow attracts insects including beetles, flies, wasps and ants. 'It appears that fungi make light so they are noticed by insects who can help the fungus colonize new habitats,' said Dr Cassius Stevani of Brazil's Instituto de Química-Universidade de São Paulo. The circadian control of bioluminescence makes the process more efficient. 'Regulation implies an adaptive function for bioluminescence,' added Dr Jay Dunlap of Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine. Here the species Neonothopanus gardneri is seen during the day, when its bioluminescent ability 'turns off' in order to conserve energy. Scientists had thought they produce light around the clock as byproduct of their metabolism, but based on this new evidence it seems that isn't so . To make the findings, the researchers made sticky, fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green LED lights (shown). When those pretend fungi were placed in the forest , the ones that were lit led many more insects to get stuck than did comparably sticky dark mushrooms . The research focused on Neonothopanus gardneri, one of the biggest and brightest of bioluminescent mushrooms. N. gardneri is also called 'flor de coco,' meaning coconut flower, by locals in Brazil, where the mushroom can be found attached to leaves at the base of young palm trees in coconut forests. Other fungi have other methods to disperse their spores like the Common Stinkhorn (shown), which releases a foul smell to get flies to attract flies . To make the findings, the researchers made sticky, fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green LED lights. When those pretend fungi were placed in the forest where the real bioluminescent mushrooms are found, the ones that were lit led many more insects to get stuck than did comparably sticky dark mushrooms. The team are now hoping to identify the genes responsible for the mushrooms' bioluminescence, and aims to explore their interaction with the circadian clock that controls them. They are also using infrared cameras to watch the interaction between N. gardneri mushrooms and arthropods, especially larger ones, more closely. And the findings could also reveal how mushrooms are dispersed by insects, which is important because N. gardneri plays a key role in forest ecosystems. 'Without them, cellulose would be stuck in its form, which would impact the whole carbon cycle on Earth,' said Dr  Stevani. 'I dare to say that life on Earth depends on organisms like these.' Some fungi in the group known as basidiomycetes, including two bioluminescent mushrooms, are also parasites of coffee and pine trees. As a result, Stevani says, 'it is very important to know how basidiomycetes grow and consequently how they spread their spores.'","Scientists in Brazil studied why certain species of mushroom glow .

"Former President Bill Clinton hit back at critics as he defended his foundation's acceptance of foreign donations before warmly welcoming Russian female punk band Pussy Riot onstage. Bill spoke during the Clinton Global Initiative University on Saturday in Florida, where he discussed the receipt of donations from foreign governments that were accepted while the former first lady served in the State Department and after she departed in early 2013. He pointed to the track record of his global philanthropy as Hillary Rodham Clinton nears an announcement on a 2016 presidential campaign. Later in the day, he was joined by musicians Maria Alekhina and Nadezdha Tolokonnikova who were detained in 2012 for staging a protest in one of Moscow's largest cathedrals. The women, who advocate for gender, LGBT and human rights, were convicted for extremism but were released several months short of their two-year sentence in December 2013. They were a part of the eight annual conference that focuses on education, environment and climate change, peace and human rights, poverty alleviation and public health. Scroll down for video .

He pointed to the track record of his global philanthropy as Hillary Rodham Clinton nears an announcement on a 2016 presidential campaign . Bill told moderator Larry Wilmore of the cable channel Comedy Central: 'My theory about all of this is disclose everything and then let people make their judgments. 'I believe we have done a lot more good than harm and I believe this is a good thing.' He spoke shortly after Hillary appeared on stage along with the couple's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, but steered clear of addressing criticism involving her use of a private email account while she served as secretary of state under President Barack Obama. Hillary also did not talk about the recent scrutiny of the foundation's fundraising practices, instead giving college students a preview of an upcoming report on the progress of women and girls by her foundation's 'No Ceilings' project. On the donations flap, Bill noted that some of the foundation's money has come from Middle Eastern nations, referencing to donations from the United Arab Emirates. 'Do we agree with everything they do? No. But they're helping us fight ISIS,' he said. Bill said he did not agree with the entire foreign policy of Saudi Arabia, another donor, but he pointed to its construction of the kingdom's first coeducational institution. He said the foundation has received donations from more than 300,000 people since its inception. 'You've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country,' he said.

In recent days, Hillary (left, with daughter Chelsea, right) has faced criticism over her use of a private email account while she was secretary of state. The disclosures have raised questions over whether Clinton complied with federal rules requiring government officials to retain written communications involving official business . In recent days, Hillary has faced criticism over her use of a private email account while she was secretary of state. The disclosures have raised questions over whether she complied with federal rules requiring government officials to retain written communications involving official business. Clinton has requested her emails to be released and the State Department is reviewing the 55,000 pages of emails she has already turned over, and congressional Republicans are investigating. Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said Hillary had spent the past week 'hiding from the press and voters' and that it was 'clear that she feels the rules that every other American lives by don't apply to her, and today's failure to answer these questions did nothing to allay any of these concerns.' Obama commented publicly on the email controversy for the first time Saturday, telling CBS News that he first heard about the private account through news reports. He also said that he was glad Hillary had 'instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.' When asked how the dust up squared with his administration's push for transparency, Obama said Hillary's decision to put them forward 'will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need.' Bill said he did not agree with the entire foreign policy of Saudi Arabia, another donor, but he pointed to its construction of the kingdom's first coeducational institution .

Hillary is building a campaign team and remains the leading Democratic presidential contender if she enters the 2016 campaign. Her appearance at the University of Miami brought her before an audience of around 1,000 college students in one of the nation's top presidential battleground states and was only a short drive from the home of a potential Republican rival, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Pointing to her upcoming 'No Ceiling' report, Hillary said 'unfinished business' remained in the educational and economic opportunities of women and girls and she would speak in detail about it next week in New York. She said she plans to black out her social media profile images on Sunday to take part in a program called 'Not There' to raise awareness about gender inequality.","Former president Bill Clinton hit back at critics who questioned his foundations acceptance of donations from foreign governments .

[She crosses one foot behind the other in her now-signature pose.]' Kendall went on to explain: 'You have to keep moving your feet!' Although this seems rather counter-intuitive, the point is to never keep the pressure on the ball of one foot for too long, but rather to regularly shift the weight to alleviate the pain. The model sported lower heels for the recent Chanel Autumn/Winter 2015 show, but her top tip works for all heel heights . After the show comes the after-party! Kendall still sporting sky-high heels after the Balmain show with BFF Gigi Hadid . In the interview, Kendall also went on to reveal a physical attribute that makes heel-wearing even more painful.

"While trust, a similar sense of humour and honesty are judged the three most important factors in a relationship, a few other elements are essential for long-lasting love. According to a new survey in which British couples were asked to spill the beans on what they feel are the secrets to a happy marriage, having two cars, his and hers toilets and televisions all got the vote. Interestingly having regular sex only came in 20th on the list of 50 marriage tips, from a poll of 2,000 couples to mark the launch of a new book, How to Seduce Your Wife (or Anyone Else's). Why fight over programmes you both don't want to watch? Happy couples say they just get two separate televisions . Two bathrooms and toilets are another key to a happy relationship, according to a poll of 2,000 people . Getting on with each other's friends and family, having no ex-partners on your Facebook friends list and separate bank accounts also feature in the top 50 secrets. Blissful couples also say trust, remembering birthdays and anniversaries and saying 'I love you' regularly help keep a relationship happy and harmonious. The book's author Andy Gibney said: 'Trust, compromise and honesty are generally regarded as the most important things in a marriage but for most people, it's not that simple. 'In the modern world, marriages are having to survive against a host of new technology with many couple falling out over what to watch on the TV or one or both of you spending too much time focusing on your computers, tablets or mobile phones. 'Romance is also an important factor, whether this is a surprise gift, a date night or simply some quality time together. 'After being married for a while, it's easy to find you are stuck in a rut and not really paying each other any attention, but hopefully some of these 'secrets' will be helpful.' Trust, honesty and a shared sense of humour are the top three elements in a happy marriage, a survey finds . Always being honest with each other and remembering each other's birthdays and important anniversaries come in as third and fourth most important ingredients to lasting love and accepting each other's faults comes fifth. Compromising, saying 'I love you' regularly, knowing when to say sorry, being able to laugh at each other and having a similar outlook on life complete the top ten. Blissful couples also recommend regular hugs and cuddles, always kissing each other goodnight and in the mornings before leaving the house and surprising your other half with the occasional romantic gesture. His 'n' hers motors is the 35th most important ingredient to marital happiness, according to the poll . Considering your partner to be your best friend, sharing parenting duties equally and having at least some shared hobbies or interests also feature high on the list. Talking about a problem instead of bottling it up, asking how your partner's day has gone and having regular sex completed the top 20. But in order to cut down on the disagreements, the secrets to a happy marriage also include no hogging the remote, having two TVs in the house to avoid any clashes over what to watch and each person having their own car. Being happy to share your phone code or social media passwords with your partner also leads to a happy marriage. The top 50 also includes never going to sleep on an argument and surprise gifts. It also emerged that three quarters of people think you are more likely to have a happy and successful marriage if you are friends before becoming an item, while 95 per cent consider romance to be important. But less than one in ten want the traditional flowers and chocolates, with 29 per cent just wanting a little surprise from their partner every now and then. Another 21 per cent see gifts as a romantic gesture if it's something personal to them, while one in four just enjoy the small gestures such as holding hands in public. Mr Gibney added: 'It should be obvious that it is communication that keeps people together, whether that's verbal or non-verbal, but life has a way of getting in the way. 'The research, and the message in the book, is keep talking, keep laughing, keep doing the things that made you happy at the start of your relationship and never lose it.

"A father drowned after saving his 13-year-old son from choppy waters after he slipped and fell off of a rock. Steven Arthur Bierle from Gardiner, Montana, was with his family on vacation at Shelter Cove in northern California when the tragic incident unfolded. The 44-year-old saw his son plunge into the water and dived in after him. Tragedy:Steven Arthur Bierle, 44, from Gardiner, Montana, was with his family on vacation at Black Beach, Shelter Cove, in northern California when the tragic incident unfolded . He managed to push the youngster back out onto the beach, but a large waved forced him underwater. A short time later he was spotted face down in the water, was too far from the shoreline for any bystanders to attempt a rescue, according to the Eureka Times Standard. The Shelter Cove Volunteer Fire Department responded and recovered Bierle from the ocean. Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful, and he died at the scene. His sister-in-law Sarah Bierle, shared a Facebook post written by Steve's wife Sandy. She thanked friends and family for the 'outpouring of love'. Penning the tribute from the hotel where they were staying, she said her 'partner and love' died during an accident where he saved his son's life 'but lost his own'. Hero: The 44-year-old saw his son plunge into the water and dived in after him. He managed to save his son's life but not his own . She said the boy was banged up with a broken arm. Mrs Bierle owned rafting firm Flying Pig Adventure Company, which offered trips to Yellowstone Park. Shelter Cover is in a remote area of redwoods and towering mountains referred to as the Lost Coast.

"Five teenage girls who showed 'an interest' in travelling to Syria have been barred by a High Court judge from travelling abroad. Mr Justice Hayden today made the two 15-year-olds and three 16-year-olds wards of court - a move which prevents them from leaving the jurisdiction of England and Wales. He made the ruling at a hearing at the High Court after Tower Hamlets local authority raised concerns. The five girls were made wards of court, which prevents them from leaving the UK. Mr Justice Hayden made the ruling today at the High Court (pictured) after hearing the girls had 'shown an interest' in travelling to Syria . The judge, who directed that the girls could not be identified although it is believed all five are from Tower Hamlets in East London, also made orders removing their passports and those of a number of adults involved in their care. He said the ban was a  'draconian' step, as was the removal of the passport. Mr Justice Hayden told the hearing: 'But the risk contemplated here is as grave as it can be for it is common knowledge that so many have lost their lives in Syria and so many have gone knowing that would be likely. 'As I said early this week in another case, and I repeat it in this, sometimes the law has to intervene to protect these young people, ultimately from themselves. The judge said the ban was a 'draconian' step, but necessary to protect the girls. Pictured: Aleppo, Syria . 'Therefore I am satisfied there is evidence of sufficient cogency and the evaluation of risk is such as to justify the orders sought.' The girls and adults concerned, who were not in court today, can challenge the emergency ruling at a future date if they wish. The judge added he made the order to include the adults because of evidence that in at least one other case young girls had travelled on passports belonging to members of their family. He also said there was evidence suggesting that the family members in the case had not been full and frank with social services, and that the girls had been moving to a more radicalised position. 'It seems to me that that must have been known to the parents and they deliberately did not share it with the authorities who were keen to protect these vulnerable young girls.' Authorities are making increasingly strenuous efforts to stop young British people - including teenagers as young as 15 - trying to reach areas of Syria controlled by Islamic State militants. The ruling comes just three days after the judge banned a 16-year-old boy from Brighton from travelling abroad after his two elder brothers were killed fighting jihad in Syria. The teenager, who cannot be named, was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London on Tuesday. The judge made the ruling after social services at Brighton and Hove City Council raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers' footsteps and travel to the war-torn region. Barrister Martin Downs, representing the council, told the court that three of his brothers had gone to fight for the al-Nusra Front - a group with links to al-Qaeda. British teenagers Shamima Begun, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana walk through security at Gatwick airport before boarding a flight to Turkey in February . Two had died in their teens and the third had been wounded but was still fighting in Syria. A friend of the teenager had also been killed in fighting. Mr Downs added that his family had an 'extraordinary history' and he also had an uncle who had been held in United States' detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The ruling prevents the teenager, who has dual Libyan and British citizenship, from leaving England and Wales. In February Sharmeena Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, all fled to Syria. All four schoolgirls attended Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets. Sharmeena is now living in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, in Syria, as a jihadi bride and told her father she will never come home.","Five teenage girls from Tower Hamlets, London, barred from travelling .

"A college student who went missing following a spring break party had been found dead near a water park in south Texas. The body of Jordan Britten, 20, from Killeen, Texas, was discovered in a marsh nearly one week after his disappearance last Friday. Mr Britten was found wearing nothing but his underwear, and police say they had previously recovered drugs from the student's car. Tragic death: Jordan Britten, 20, from Killeen, Texas, went missing after a spring break concert at a water park near the Mexican border  last Friday . Mr Britten had been attending a spring break concert at a water park on South Padre Island, near the Mexican border, on Friday night. The student is said to have 'wandered off' during the party and was reported missing on Sunday when his family was alerted by his friends, NY Daily News reports. Local police found the Central Texas College student's car parked at the water park and recovered 'marijuana, what appeared to be ecstasy pills and other unknown pills' in the silver Mazda. Discovery: Local police found Mr Britten's near naked body in a marsh behind the waterpark on Thursday . Drugs find: Police recovered marijuana 'ecstasy pills' and other pills of unknown origin in the 20-year-old's car which was parked at the water park . Mr Britten's undressed body was discovered by police in the marsh behind the Schlitterbahn waterpark on Thursday morning. Police view the death as 'suspicious' due to the discovery of drugs in Mr Britten's car. Authorities are investigating the possibility that Mr Britten was ejected from the spring break concert and was attempting to re-enter the water park from the back by walking through the marsh. 'At this time we're investigating all possibilities considering the fact that we did find drugs in his car,' South Padre Island city spokesman Adrian Rodriguez told the NY Daily News.","Student Jordan Britten, 20, found dead in a marsh in south Texas .

"Will the same worm respond differently in a situation depending on what it is thinking? According to new research studying neurons within microscopic roundworms, the answer is an emphatic ‘yes’. They found that worms would choose to respond to a nearby odour depending on what they were ‘thinking’ about - suggesting they have free will just like humans. The study was carried out by scientists at Rockefeller University in New York. They found roundworms (pictured) would sometimes 'think' for themselves. All the neurons within this microscopic roundworm are highlighted, with the large cluster at one end representing the brain . The research was carried out by scientists from the Rockefeller University in New York who studied the brain of the microscopic roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Its 302 neurons and 7,000 synapses are comparatively tiny compared to the 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses in a human brain. But it is still useful to address tricky neurological questions that would be nearly impossible to broach in our own brains. Worms spend their time wandering, looking for decomposing matter to eat - and when they smell it, they usually stop making random turns and travel straight toward the source. This change in behaviour is initially triggered by a sensory neuron that perceives the smell and feeds that information to the network the researchers studied. As the worms pick up the alluring fruity smell of isoamyl alcohol, the neurons in the network transition into a low activity state that allows them to approach the odour. But sometimes the neurons remain highly active, and the worm continues to wander around - even though its sensory neuron has detected the odour. They found that, if offered a 'delicious' smell, the roundworm will usually stop its wandering to investigate the source - but sometimes it won’t. Just as with humans, the same stimulus does not always provoke the same response, even from the same individual. ‘We found that the collective state of the three neurons at the exact moment an odour arrives determines the likelihood that the worm will move toward the smell,’ said study author Dr Cori Bargmann . ‘So, in essence, what the worm is thinking about at the time determines how it responds. ‘It goes to show that nervous systems aren’t passively waiting for signals from outside, they have their own internal patterns of activity that are as important as any external signal when it comes to generating a behaviour.’ The researchers also found that by changing the activity of the neurons individually, and in combination, they could pinpoint each neuron’s role in generating variability. In humans, the research may suggest ways in which our brains process competing motivations. 'For humans, a hungry state might lead to you walk across the street to a delicious smelling restaurant,' said author Andrew Gordus. 'However, a competing aversion to the cold might lead you to stay indoors' (stock image) By recording the activity of the neurons, the team found that there were three persistent states among the three neurons: All were off, all were on, or only one, called AIB, was on. If all were off when the odour signal arrived, they stayed off. If all were on, they often - but not always - shut off. By recording the activity of the neurons, the team found that there were three persistent states among the three neurons: All were off, all were on, or only one, called AIB, was on. If all were off when the odour signal arrived, they stayed off. If all were on, they often - but not always - shut off. And, in the third and most telling scenario, if AIB alone was active when the odour arrived, everything shut off. 'This means that for AIB, context matters,' continued author and research associate Andrew Gordus. AIB is the first neuron in the network to receive the signal, which it then relays to the other two network members, known as RIM and AVA; AVA sends out the final instruction to the muscles. And, in the third and most telling scenario, if AIB alone was active when the odour arrived, everything shut off. 'This means that for AIB, context matters,' continued author and research associate Andrew Gordus. 'If it’s on alone, its activity will drop when odour is added, but if it’s on with the rest of the network, it has difficulty dropping its activity with the others.' AIB is the first neuron in the network to receive the signal, which it then relays to the other two network members, known as RIM and AVA; AVA sends out the final instruction to the muscles. When the researchers shut off RIM and AVA individually and together, they found AIB’s response to the odour signal improved. This suggests that input from these two neurons competes with the sensory signal as it feeds down through the network. Scaled up to account for the more nuanced behaviours of humans, the research may suggest ways in which our brains process competing motivations. 'For humans, a hungry state might lead to you walk across the street to a delicious smelling restaurant,' said Professor Gordus. 'However, a competing aversion to the cold might lead you to stay indoors.'","Study was carried out by scientists at Rockefeller University in New York .

"As  romantic comedy Pretty Woman celebrates its 25-year anniversary this week, the film's scriptwriter has revealed that the iconic fairy-tale ending could have been very different. The 1990 film, which is set in Los Angeles, sees Julia Roberts as Vivian, a down-on-her-luck prostitute who agrees to become a one-week escort for wealthy businessman, Edward Lewis, played by Richard Gere. The much-loved movie ends with the improbable pair going off in the sunset together - yet the original  ending was more realistic and was intended to reflect his story's 'dark and gritty' tone. Scroll down for video . The iconic necklace scene may have remained, but Pretty Woman was originally titled $3,000 and had an ending where the lead characters, Vivian and Edward, do not end up together . Edward and Vivian's clumsy-but-cute first-meet on Hollywood Boulevard never happens either. In the original script, Edward is seen to patrol around  intentionally looking for a prostitute . American screenwriter J.F. Lawton, who penned the original script, which was called $3000 for the amount Edward agrees to pay Vivian for a week of her company, revealed in an interview with Vanity Fair that: 'The tone and ending are completely different.' Most notably, in Lawton's original script Vivian and Edward do not find true love together. Indeed, Pretty Woman's Cinderella ending that sees Edward as a modern-day knight in shining armour, who 'rescues' Vivian from her apartment block would have been completely different. Instead, Lawton says: 'The film ends with Kit [Vivian's prostitute friend] and Vivian on a bus bound for Disneyland... with Kit anticipating a fun day financed by Vivian's week with Edward, as Vivian 'stares out emptily ahead.'' This dismal ending was just one of the many changes that happened. Lawton's script also portrayed  Vivian as a drug addict and the six pages include focus on her locking down a deal to buy crack cocaine. The original script dictates that Pretty Woman ends with Vivian and Kit on a bus bound for Disneyland as Vivian 'stares out emptily ahead'. There is no 'knight in shining armour' scene for Vivian (pictured) In the original script, Vivian is a helpless drug addict that must use prostitution to fund her crack addiction . Upon clocking the original script, even Julia Roberts described it as, 'a really dark and depressing, horrible, terrible story about two horrible people. She said: 'My character was this drug addict, a bad-tempered, foulmouthed, ill-humored, poorly educated hooker who had this weeklong experience with a foulmouthed, ill-tempered, bad-humored, very wealthy, handsome but horrible man and it was just a grisly, ugly story about these two people.' The lead characters' adorable meeting on Hollywood boulevard is no romantic affair either. The film's version portrays Edward comically and clumsily unable to drive his borrowed sports' car and stopping to ask for directions from a chirpy Vivian, who thinks he's a potential customer. In the original script,  Edward is very much looking for a prostitute when he stumbles upon Vivian . Pretty Woman stars reunited on NBC's Today show this morning, left to right: Hector Elizondo, Laura San Giacomo, director Garry Marshall, presenter Matt Lauer, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere . Pretty woman! The original scriptwriter has admitted that the ending could never have stayed the same 'dark and gritty' way once the film was cast, as Richard Gere and Julia Roberts 'just light up with each other' The iconic shopping scene where Vivian is given Edward's card and goes on a limitless shopping spree never happens in the original script . In the film,  Richard Gere's character Edward is constantly looking out for Vivian and even enlists the help of shop assistants to help her with her new wardrobe. In the original script he never tries to protect Julia Robert's character Vivian. He instead cruelly offers her up to his friend as if she were just a possession . And magical shopping scene, with the soundtrack of  Roy Orbison's catchy Pretty Woman? It never happens. The moment where Edward defends Vivian's honour by hitting his sleazy friend Stucky - who assaults her in Edward's hotel suite - is also a missing component in the original script. Instead Edward demeans Vivian and offers her up to his friend as if she were a possession: 'You want her? I don't mind. You want to try her?' While the last words that the couple ever say to each other in the first  script are definitely more than a little depressing. Rather than defend her from his sleazy friend, the  script sees Edward offer Vivian up like a piece of meat . The movie version sees Vivian having the confidence to gun for a relationship with the businessman before taking off to start a new life off the streets. Inspired by her, he jumps into his white limo to declare his undying love, asking, 'So what happens after he climbs up and rescues her? She replies: 'She rescues him right back.' They then kiss passionately on the fire escape as the credits roll. In the unrevised story, Edward is supposed to drag Vivian from his car, callously throwing her on the ground, where he first picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard. He throws money at her and heartlessly gets back in the car, saying: 'You'll regret it tomorrow if you don't take it. You'll regret it the minute I drive away.' Vivian responds by screaming at him: 'Go to hell! I hate you! I hate your money! I hate it!' In the unrevised script, Richard Gere never 'rescues' Julia Roberts with roses up her apartment ladder, but instead throws her heartlessly from his car and chucks money at her . The original script show the heated and horrid final exchange between the two characters, who clearly never end up together . Lawton's script became hot property after it was pitched to Disney's production company, Touchstone. But after it was given a large budget and big name director Garry Marshall it was largely rewritten as a rom-com. Lawton suspects this rewrite was partially down to the casting of the leads Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. 'They had auditioned Al Pacino, they had auditioned Michelle Pfeiffer, and it would definitely have been a different movie if had it been Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer,' he said. Julia Roberts described her original character as 'this drug addict, a bad-tempered, foulmouthed, ill-humored, poorly educated hooker,' rather than the lovable and talkative Vivian in Pretty Woman . The Pretty Woman cast reminisced about making the movie 25 years after it came out on NBC's Today Show . Julia Roberts and Richard Gere have a laugh as they remember filming the 1992 blockbuster rom com . 'It might have been closer to the original script and maybe not have had a happy ending. 'But the chemistry between Julia and Gere, it is palpable on the screen, it was palpable in auditions. 'You can't really see how it could end any other way, because they just light up with each other,' the screenwriter admits. Garry Marshall agreed, and has also revealed that he had a set vision for what he wanted his fairytale rewrite to capture. Marshall admitted: ''My vision was a combination of fairy tales. Julia [Roberts] was Rapunzel, Richard [Gere] was Prince Charming and Hector [Elizondo - who plays the kind hotel manager] was the fairy godmother.' Even before the rewrite, Marshall described the film as a story about 'a girl who wanted to change her life, and did'. TITANIC: At the end of the film, instead of the elderly modern-day Rose dropping the iconic 'Heart of the Ocean' necklace into the sea without a word to anyone, she stands with the treasure hunter and launches into a cheesy speech about life being the only priceless thing. Then she drops the necklace into the sea. THELMA & LOUISE: Instead of the film ending mid-air during Thelma and Louise' death dive off the cliff  - which gives connotations of freedom and spirit - the car is seen violently tumbling down the mountain in a deathly fiery blaze. SWEET HOME ALABAMA: Rather than the tame ending where the couple kiss and then celebrate with their friends, an alternate ending sees Josh Lucas carrying Reese Witherspoon's lifeless body into the party. He is about to announce her sudden death, when they both reveal it's a tasteless joke...  Only then do they live happily ever after. ROCKY BALBOA: In the film, Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is defeated in his comeback fight by his younger and fitter opponent (a realistic offering). Whereas Rocky is victorious in the alternate ending. DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY: The Average Joe's team wins in the actual film, but an alternate ending sees them lose. This was changed after test audiences reacted badly to this first unhappy ending. At the end of the actual film, Ben Stiller references this by saying 'You happy now?'","Rom com Pretty Woman celebrates it's 25th  anniversary this week .

"Museums give a snapshot of the past but their static displays struggle to truly emulate what it would have been like to live in an ancient era. Now an archaeologist is hoping to merge the present with the past using augmented reality to make people feel as if they have travelled back in time. The Dead Men’s Eyes app puts virtual buildings on top of real world images, and his Dead Men’s Nose bag emits odours to make the environment smell like it would have done in the past. The Dead Men’s Eyes prototype was developed by Dr Stuart Eve from University College London. It uses augmented reality to lay virtual images onto the real world (virtual huts are shown on the site of a prehistoric settlement on Leskernick Hill, Cornwall). The setup uses the camera on an iPad and an augmented reality app . The prototype applications and hardware were developed by Dr Stuart Eve, an honorary research associate at the Institute of Archaeology University College London (UCL) and a member of L - P : Archaeology. Dead Men’s Eye uses an iPad’s GPS to pinpoint the user’s location. When they hold the iPad’s camera up to the landscape, virtual reconstructions are placed on top of the real world images. These reconstructions move and change in real-time as the user moves around the terrain. It uses a mixture of the Unity3D gaming engine and Vuforia’s augmented reality technology to place the virtual layers in their correct location and perspective - taken from archaeological data - based on where the user is stood. 'Augmented reality enables us to give glimpses into the past - that are not possible if you are just walking around a site or indeed part of a city of a rural field in the middle of nowhere,' Dr Eve told MailOnline. 'These 'experiences' could be easily recreated within a virtual reality environment, by donning an Oculus Rift and some VR gloves we can see and touch the past. During the Bronze Age the site on Bodmin Moor was a tin-mining village. When Dr Eve held the camera up to the hill (left) a series of huts appeared to make it look like he was exploring the ancient village (right). These reconstructions move and change in real-time as the user moves around the terrain . To make this experience more immersive, the archaeologist also developed the Dead Men’s Nose (shown being worn by Dr Eve). It can emit specific smells and these could include the smell of barbecues wafting through a virtual scene, or the bag could feature smells of woodsmoke and manure . 'However, by creating the whole experience within a computer and then donning a pair of closed goggles - we run the risk of cutting ourselves off from the real world - and creating bands of zombies plugged into computers who never have any experience of the real world and instead choose to live within a virtual world - with all interactions mediated through a computer.' Dead Men’s Eye uses an iPad’s GPS to pinpoint the user’s location. When they hold the iPad’s camera up to the landscape virtual reconstructions are placed on top of the real world images. These reconstructions move and change in real-time as the user moves around the terrain. It uses a mixture of the Unity3D gaming engine and Vuforia’s augmented reality technology to place the virtual layers in their correct location and perspective – taken from archaeological data – based on where the user is stood. The Dead Man’s Nose is a prototype of a smell delivery device that wafts smells to the user's nose based on their location. The hardware is built using an Arduino microcontroller and computer parts and can be used with any scent of the user’s choice. Software-wise, the device connects to a webserver and ‘fires off’ smells when connected to the Unity3D technology, for example. Consequently the smells are released at the correct time and location as the user explores. In one example Dr Eve used his technology on the side of Leskernick Hill, in the middle of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall. During the Bronze Age the site was a tin-mining village. When Dr Eve held the camera up to the hill a series of huts appear to make it look like he’s exploring the prehistoric settlement. ‘Seeing a reconstruction of the village that can be physically explored when you are standing in the real location is a visceral experience and, for me, comes pretty close to a time machine,’ added Dr Eve. To make this experience more immersive, Dr Eve has also developed the Dead Men’s Nose bag. The devices can either be placed around the landscape to emit specific smells, or worn by the user as they explore the augmented world. For example, the smell of barbecues could be wafted through scene or a bag could feature smells of woodsmoke and manure. ‘The Dead Man’s Nose is a very early prototype of a smell delivery device that wafts certain smells gently into your nose based on your location,’ said Dr Eve. The hardware uses an Arduino microcontroller with standard computer parts and can be used with any scent of the user’s choice. Software-wise, the device connects to a webserver and ‘fires off’ smells when connected to the Unity3D technology, for example.

In a similar project, the Museum of London's Streetmuseum app lets people walk side-by-side with Londoners from the 19th and 20th century. The app recognises a user's location and overlays the historic image over the current view - augmenting the reality that the smartphone camera perceives . In February last year the Museum of London updated its Streetmuseum app to let people walk side-by-side with Londoners from the 19th and 20th century. For those using the app on the move, the app recognises their location and overlays the historic image over the current view - augmenting the reality that the smartphone camera perceives. Each historic photograph was taken by a renowned photographer, including Henry Grant, Wolfgang Suschitsky, Roger Mayne and George Davison Reid. There are more than 100 locations and images ranging from  1868 to 2003. Consequently the smells can be released at the correct time and location as the user explores. ‘Technological development is moving at an incredible rate, and already it is possible to wear transparent glasses with forward-facing cameras to overlay the AR information directly onto your field of vision, rather than having to use a portable handheld device such as a mobile telephone’ continued Dr Eve. ‘As this develops further, this will go some way towards mitigating the disconnectedness of having to hold up a mobile device in order to experience the virtual objects.’ The name of the prototypes was taken from the Montague Rhodes James' short story, ‘Dead Men’s Eyes (A View from a Hill)’. In the story, character Mr Fanshawe discovers a pair of field glasses and when he looks through them, he sees the past. 'It is really exciting stuff and the technology is in its infancy - but as with any new thing - it has to be carefully led in the right way, otherwise it will just end us up in some dystopic future where we get things beamed directly to our brains!' concluded Dr Eve.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has an army of professional trolls flooding the internet with pro-Russian propaganda . Vladimir Putin has an army of professional trolls running thousand of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts to flood social media with pro-Russia propaganda. Hundreds of workers are paid £500 a month to work exhausting 12-hour shifts bombarding the internet with comments placing Putin in a more favourable light. The trolls work under strict condition which see them banned from talking and even forging friendships with one another. One former worker at the Internet Research Centre - dubbed the Troll Factory - has lifted the lid on how employees must write more than 130 online posts a shift or face the sack. Marat Burkhard explained how the operation, based in modern building in St Petersburg, is opened 24 hours a day and employees often work in teams of three. 'One of us would be the 'villain,' the person who disagrees with the forum and criticizes the authorities, in order to bring a feeling of authenticity to what we're doing, he told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 'The other two enter into a debate with him -- ""No, you're not right; everything here is totally correct."" 'We create the illusion of actual activity on these forums.' Mr Burkhard revealed  how he and his fellow trolls got to work after a story broke about US President Barack Obama spitting his chewing gum out in India. ''You need to write 135 comments about this, and don't be shy about how you express yourself,' Mr Burkhard, reportedly said he was told. ''Write whatever you want, just stick the word Obama in there a lot and then cover it over with profanities."" On another occasion he was told to repeatedly post on websites that the majority of German's supported Putin and his policies and were unhappy with Merkel. Inside the factory the trolls are not just targeting Russian sites but those around the world, including the UK. The trolls are often given five key words which they must make sure each of their posts are littered with. He claimed workers faced sanctions from manager if they were missing from their comments. The comments must make Putin appear in a more favourable light compared with his western counterparts . Mr Burkhard, who now works as a blogger, quit after two months slaving away at his keyboard. 'I decided  I can't engage in absurd work,' he said, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 'To keep going didn't make any sense - it's all absurd. He compared his time at the Troll factory to the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's 1984. 'You work in the Ministry of Truth, which is the Ministry of Lies, and everyone kind of believes in this truth.'

"Calais officials are poised to start bulldozing the illegal migrant camps that have marred the town for more than a decade. Yesterday it emerged that the Prefect of Calais has issued an ultimatum to migrants telling them to remove their belongings and evacuate by the end of the month or be forcibly ejected by riot police. It comes as the Mayor of the port town opened the first purpose built accommodation for migrants since the closure of the notorious Sangatte centre in 2002.

It is believed the French authorities plan to raze the illegal shanty town which has grown up around the town’s ferry port next Tuesday. The land is owned by a chemical company Tioxide who succeeded in securing an eviction notice on the migrants last summer. But since then the police have failed to move them on and the area has become blighted by rubbish and roughly improvised shelters causing fury among local French residents. It is estimated that there are around 2,000 men, women and children sleeping rough in the town hoping to cross the channel into the UK. Natacha Bouchart, the mayor of Calais, hopes the centre will allow authorities to get a grip on the situation which has plagued her town for months . Once cleared from their existing camps the migrants will be moved to an area of wasteland alongside the Jules Ferry site. The town mayor Natacha Bouchart hopes the measure will help the authorities to gain control over the town’s chaotic migrant population and limit the influence of the people smugglers who exploit the desperation of those living in the filthy camps. But yesterday critics feared the move would only exacerbate the problem with charity workers predicting it would take the women given beds an average of three months to sneak into the UK. Gonzague Van Isacker from the charity Solid’R said: ‘The length of stay at this centre is expected to vary a lot. ‘Perhaps an average of three months for women without children before they manage to get to England.’ Jules Ferry, which has been converted from a former children’s holiday camp, will offer beds, food and hot showers to women and children on the basis that they are too ‘vulnerable’ to be sleeping rough. Set in beautiful dune land next to massive WW2 German bunkers and beaches which afford stunning views of the Channel and the white cliffs of Dover, the centre is half an hour’s walk from the ferry terminal. In addition to the Jules Ferry centre another ‘day’ shelter was also opened yesterday. This will offer migrants showers and mobile phone chargers as well as serving 4,000 meals a day. But the British government has long argued that such measures will only increase the numbers of displaced people congregating in the area with the aim of getting onto lorries crossing to Dover. During the six years that Sangatte was open, it acted as stepping stone to Britain for an estimated 18,000 illegal immigrants and remains a source of bad feeling between Britain and France. Conservative MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the Home Affairs Committee, told MailOnline: ‘The French need to tackle illegal immigration themselves and not set up a camp convenient for for going to England. The new centre has been dubbed Sangatte 2, named after a previous Red Cross centre (pictured) which housed migrants close to the French end of the Channel Tunnel until it was destroyed in 2002 . ‘The French signed up to open borders and now they are failing to properly deal with the consequences. ‘There is a danger that this camp will turn into a new Sangatte, with all the problems that entailed.’ Earlier this week Mayor Bouchart, 52, herself the daughter of eastern European migrants who settled in France, used a speech to European council to blame Britain for the lawlessness in Calais. Speaking on Tuesday she said her town was ‘suffering the consequences of the custodial role Britain has imposed on us to guard its frontier on our territory.’ Relations between the neighbouring countries have steadily deteriorated over the last year over the problem of Calais. Last summer mass brawls between rival gangs left more than 70 people injured and has forced the French riot police to maintain an almost constant presence to keep the peace. In October Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to pledge £12million to tighten security in Calais after 250 immigrants stormed the ferry terminal hoping to make it across the Channel. But last night regional Prefect Denis Robin denied this insisting the new shelters are ‘humanitarian gestures.’ He said: ‘Neither of these centres are in any way new Sangatte-type hostels in Calais.’","Up to 2,000 migrants have been living in Calais shanty towns for months .

"Dressed in jumpsuits, hands in cuffs, or locked away in tiny cells, these are the youths held by America's juvenile justice system. The emotional portraits, taken at three 'school' facilities around Washington state, show the inmates standing in prison corridors and resting in their rooms - as well as others which simply try to show how they are feeling. All of the subjects have been locked away after sentencing in the state's juvenile courts, and are part of a project by photographer Steve Davis. Incarcerated: The photo series shows inmates held in Washington state's juvenile prison system, such as the two men above . Grim: One inmate is pictured above in his room, which features a combination toilet-sink, which seemingly leaks . Bleak surroundings: Photographer Steve Davis visited three school-cum-prison facilities in the state, and photographed inmates and their surroundings . Cuffed: These two prisoners have their wrists and ankles bound in the uncompromising portrait above . However, while Davis, whose images are due to be published in an upcoming book, focused on the prisoners' human side for his series, he deliberately left out one aspect: their pasts. Each portrait has been left without a label identifying the prisoner, in an attempt to break the link between those depicted and their crimes. He also shows their bleak living conditions, from a stark gym to a deserted exercise yard, to uncomfortable-looking standard-issue single beds. Marketing material for Davis's book says the intention is that 'the viewer must draw conclusions about each person’s past and possible future... from the simultaneously vast and limited information in each photograph'. Davis, who took the photographs between 1997 and 2005, met the subjects through his work as a resident artist in three of Washington's detention centers, which double as schools. Obscure: Davis made the deliberate decision not to mention the crimes which led to the youths being locked away . No home comforts: The images show bare sleeping, social and exercise space inside the prison system . Prison system: State officials say the juvenile detention centers are a last resort for dangerous youths or those who have no responded to other measures . Around 750 youths a year are sent to juvenile detention facilities in Washington. State information on the system says those sent there have often committed violent crimes or ignored previous punishments. Information from the overseeing Social and Health Services department says: 'These youngsters are typically serious and violent offenders or youth with extensive offense histories who have not responded to local sanctions and interventions.' Children as young as 12 can be incarcerated, and can stay in the facilities until they are 20. More than 90 per cent are male. According to data from September 2014, around two thirds are aged 16-18. Some 19 per cent are sex offenders, while 54 per cent have been convicted of violent crimes. Robbery, assault, burglary and rape feature prominently among the convictions which led to their incarcerations. Around half have mental health issues. Judgement? Davis intended his views to draw their own conclusions from the pictures .

"A huge crack in a cliff is threatening a luxury mansion at the same Texas spot where another vacation house had to be burnt down last year because it was so unstable. There are now concerns that this home in a gated community could also collapse and crumble into Lake Whitney about 60 miles south of Fort Worth. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers told NBC says it is 'very concerned with public safety' in light of the new crack. Scroll down for video . A huge crack in a cliff is threatening a luxury mansion at the same Texas spot where another vacation house had to be burnt down last year because it was so unstable . There are now concerns that the home in a gated community could also collapse and crumble into Lake Whitney about 60 miles south of Fort Worth . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers told NBC says it is 'very concerned with public safety' in light of the new crack . Neighbor Steve Mellgren told WFAA: 'It's getting larger... it's getting wider... it's getting deeper.' He said recent rains have seen the crack open even further. 'If it does happen... if anybody's near this cliff... it's going to be a problem for them,' he said. 'Could be loss of life.' There are buoys floating near the cliff, meant to keep boaters away. The Corps of Engineers said Tuesday it will work to 'keep things as safe as possible in the area until the danger has subsided.' Last year charred debris from a luxury cliff-side home fell 75 feet into a lake below after fire crews set the $700,000 retreat ablaze rather than wait for it to crumble into the water as the land faltered around it. The White Bluff home was built on a fault line and was gradually collapsing with the cliff side into the lake . It took less than an hour for the fire to level the home above Lake Whitney. Flames consumed exterior walls after crews spread bales of hay and fuel to ignite flames throughout the expansive home. Neighbor Steve Mellgren told WFAA: 'It's getting larger... it's getting wider... it's getting deeper' The Corps of Engineers said Tuesday it will work to 'keep things as safe as possible in the area until the danger has subsided' The ground around the home cracked and became unstable until a part of the land gave way beneath the 4,000-square-foot home, leaving pieces of the house dangling off the side of a cliff. Authorities condemned the home and the owners, Robert and Denise Webb, consented to the burn. Authorities said destroying the house was better than waiting for it to topple into Lake Whitney. The cost of removing mounds of debris from the lake could prove prohibitive. Spectators in dozens of boats witnessed the demolition from a safe distance. The home is right next door to the one which was burnt down in June 2014 because it was so unstable . Live television coverage shared the view of the spiraling black smoke coming from the gated resort community. The Webbs purchased the home in 2012, but a few weeks ago were forced to remove their personal items and relocate. They expressed shock and sadness at losing their lake house. The Webbs, who also have a home along Florida's Miami Beach, told WTSP-TV that the deterioration of their property has been hard to watch. 'You know, that's my life there that we're watching fall off,' Robert Webb said the day before the demolition. Geologists and inspectors had told them before they purchased the land that the property was perfectly stable, 'and so we bought it in good faith,' Webb said. The house, built in 2007, was to have been left to his grandchildren, he said. 'It's really tough, that house was special and I don't even know why it was so special but it was special to me,' Denise Webb said.

"Labour is trying to shut down Margaret Thatcher's flagship 'right to buy' policy by the back door, a minister warned yesterday. Housing minister Brandon Lewis branded Labour the 'enemy of aspiration' over growing moves by the party to curb the right of people to buy their council home. Earlier this month, Ed Miliband's housing adviser Sir Michael Lyons described right to buy as a 'failure'. Welsh Labour has said it will restrict or even abolish the right to buy if it wins power in the principality next year. Ministers fear Mr Miliband could cut a post-election deal with the SNP, which has already scrapped the right to buy. Earlier this month, Labour leader Ed Miliband's (pictured) housing adviser Sir Michael Lyons described right to buy as a 'failure' And a string of Labour councils have introduced moves in recent months that will curb the right to buy in the future. A number of Labour-run authorities are exploiting a loophole in the law to avoid having to offer council-owned homes for sale to their tenants. Enfield Council, in London, has set up a private company to buy up local properties for rent, boasting that the new company will be 'exempt from right-to-buy obligations – meaning the properties would be owned by the council until the authority chooses to sell them.' Sheffield Council has set up a new firm to build and run more than 2,000 homes in the city. And other Labour-run councils such as Ealing and Thurrock are now following suit. Mr Lewis said he would act to outlaw the practice if the Conservatives win power in May. But he also accused Labour of a wider attempt to run down the right to buy, which the Tories are expected to extend. Mr Lewis said: 'Once again the Labour Party is proving itself to be the enemy of aspiration by trying to block the rights of hard working people to buy their own home. 'The right to buy not only gives something back to families who worked hard, paid their rent and played by the rules, it also allows them to do up their home, change their front door, improve their garden - without getting permission from the council. 'This Government has worked hard to reinvigorate the scheme, which gives people a sense of pride and ownership not just in their home, but in their street and neighbourhood, helping to build strong families and stable mixed communities. Now Housing Minister Brandon Lewis claims Labour is trying to shut down Margaret Thatcher's flagship 'right to buy' policy by the back door . 'By contrast in Labour-run Wales the housing ladder has been kicked away for thousands of hardworking families and Welsh Labour is returning to its outdated socialist dogma, believing that government rather than individuals know what is best for them and their families.' Labour critics of the right to buy claim that it has resulted in the stock of public housing being slashed, increasing the housing shortage. But ministers dismiss the charge, pointing out that councils are now allowed to use the proceeds from sales to build new homes, increasing the stock of housing. The right to buy withered under the last Labour government, which slashed the discounts available to tenants. In 2009-10, barely 3,000 people exercised the right to buy their home, compared to more than 200,000 at the height of the policy's popularity in 1982. The Conservatives are expected to extend the right to buy to 2.5 million people living in housing association properties if they win the election. Labour's housing review called for the right to be 'reviewed'. Former council boss Sir Michael Lyons, who drew up the report for Mr Miliband, said extending the right to buy would be 'disastrous'.","Housing Minister claims Labour is trying to shut down 'right to buy' policy .

"An Australian tourist was lucky to escape with his life after he was mauled by a lion during an African safari tour. Brendan Smith, from Perth in Western Australia, had landed in Johannesburg in South Africa just 36 hours before the vicious predator jumped through an open car window and attacked him. In a Facebook post, Mr Smith recalled the terrifying moment he was bitten, with a sense of humour. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING . Brendan Smith was on an African safari when he mauled by a lion who jumped through a window and bit him .

"Marvin Gaye's family have filed an injunction in court on Tuesday that could end the sale and distribution of 'Blurred Lines' - the wildly successful song that they claim was ripped off of the 1977 hit 'Got to Give it Up.' The injunction by Nona Gaye, Frankie Gaye and Marvin Gaye III would prevent the copying, distributing and performing of the hit single featuring Robin Thicke, Pharrell Williams, and T.I. Williams and Thicke were ordered to pay nearly $7.4million to the three children after a jury determined last week that Blurred Lines copied elements of Gaye's song. Scroll down for video .

"Tory MPs have criticised the Government for being ‘blind’ to the soaring threats Britain faces and accused it of freeloading off the US. Former Army captain John Baron said yesterday that the UK was ‘ignoring the lessons of history at our peril’ by refusing to commit to spend 2 per cent of national income on defence. He said claims that Britain boasts the world’s fifth largest defence budget ‘rings hollow’ when the Ministry of Defence is slashing manpower and capabilities. Tory MP John Baron, left, urged Prime Minister David Cameron to commit at least two per cent of the  budget to defence spending as US General Raymond Odierno warned over 'unthinkable' cuts to the British Army . The Basildon and Billericay MP said ‘misguided military interventions’ in the last decade, including Iraq and Afghanistan, had distracted the UK from the ‘greater danger of state on state’ threats from countries such as Russia. He added: ‘Failing defence budgets across Nato have emboldened the Russian president, who has concluded that the heart has gone out of the alliance. This is dangerous.’ He called on the Government to spend 3 to 4 per cent of national income on defence, saying it was ‘nonsense’ that on current projections Britain will be spending the same on defence as on foreign aid in 15 years. Referencing comments made by the US chief of staff General Raymond Odierno, he said the idea of British brigades serving within American divisions because of severe cuts to numbers was ‘unthinkable’ only a decade ago. A total of 37 MPs, the majority of whom are Tories, backed a motion in Parliament yesterday to set the defence budget at 2 per cent of national income in law, in a significant challenge to David Cameron just weeks ahead of the election. The motion, headed by Mr Baron, was passed but has no legal force. Rory Stewart, chairman of the defence select committee, waded into the four-hour debate in the Commons, saying that Britain was acting as a ‘freeloader’ to the US. He told MPs: ‘These threats are real. The world is genuinely becoming more dangerous, and Britain cannot be a freeloader. ‘People stand up and list all the different kit that we have bought, but they do not intend ever to use it.’ He added that ‘they’ were ‘freeloading’ by thinking ‘that Britain will never act alone, that the United States will somehow fill in all the gaps’. Mr Baron warned that Britain faced a significant threat from countries such as Russia . He said that if the UK was serious about defence, the Government would need to look at ballistic missiles, upgrading elite units and protecting soldiers against chemical weapons with special suits. A study by the impartial House of Commons library released this week revealed that current plans suggest defence spending will represent only 1.87 per cent of national income next year. Tory MP Simon Reevell described the Prime Minister’s suggestion that intelligence service spending could count towards the 2 per cent target as ‘kindergarten economics’. Tory Jack Lopresti said Iraq and Afghanistan showed ‘what happens when you try and deploy troops abroad on the cheap, without being properly equipped’. Mr Baron agreed: ‘It took the Americans to put in another 20,000 troops before we pulled that situation round. We require armed forces of sufficient capability and capacity to respond to any challenge.’","Tory MPs have warned the government about cuts in defence spending .

"It has been talked about and hyped-up for more than a year, but a basic evolutionary instinct could end up putting people off buying the new Apple iWatch. For once it is nothing to do with the price of the wearable technology, but the basic layout of the screen can apparently trigger a sense of 'fear' in those who are susceptible. The hexagonal appearance of the iWatch's apps on its small screen can cause trypophobia which is a fear of holes. Scroll down for video . Freaking out! Some potential buyers of the new Apple iWatch (left) say they are suffering from panic attacks and feelings of trypophobia after seeing the layout of the screen . Honey to the bee: Trypophobia is the uncontrollable and completely irrational fear of objects that have an irregular pattern of holes . In fact, the reaction can be so severe that even seeing photos of holes can set off a panic attack. Until recently, it didn't garner much attention from scientists or doctors. However the phenomenon appears to be more widespread than first thought. There is a Facebook group devoted to those who believe they are sufferers. According to the website Trypophobia.com, the phobia is a 'weird kind' and is generally considered as the fear of shapes. Usually, the fear is caused by shapes created by nature such as the holes in a beehive or the seeds in a pod, but if arranged in the right order, man-made objects such as the iWatch can also elicit a similar response. A number of people have now taken to Twitter to voice their reaction at seeing the display for the hi-tech device. 'The Apple watch is a cluster of circles no no no no', wrote one, whilst another showed a similar reaction: 'Anyone else getting a weird trypophobic reaction to the Apple Watch? I'm sorry I ever learned about that phobia existing!' Side by side: Twitter is now full of comparisons between the iWatch and occurrences in nature of . Weird: Many people do not realize they have the phobia until they see an object that triggers the reaction . New found fear? Trypophobia is not recognized as a condition in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or other scientific literature . Apple unveiled the much-anticipated Apple Watch on Monday. The basic watch sells for $349, but other models sell for $10,000 and higher. A couple of years ago, researchers at the University of Essex conducted research into the phobia. It was concluded that it is not the holes that people fear but their brains associating the holes with danger. The study suggested the widespread, predominantly latent phobia is associated with ancient threats such as beehives, poisonous flowers and venomous creatures. The reaction to these holes is intense. 'These can make them feel that their skin is crawling, shudder, feel itchy and physically sick when seeing these images because they really find it disgusting and gross.

"A medical examiner testifying Thursday in the trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnev described in graphic detail the devastating injuries that ravaged the body of a 29-year-old woman and caused her to bleed to death on the pavement. One juror cried and wiped her face with a tissue as the jury looked at autopsy photos and listened to the description of injuries suffered by Krystle Campbell. Judge George O'Toole Jr. would not allow the photos to be shown on public monitors, so people in the courtroom could not see the images; only the jurors saw them. Scroll down for video . Karen McWatters lies next to her friend Krystle Campbell (pictured right). Miss Campbell, 29, was one of three people killed in the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombings . Campbell and her friend Karen Rand  in a photo taken in Boston's public gardens in the hours before the Boston Marathon bombing . Campbell, a restaurant manager, was one of three people killed when twin pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon on April 15, 2013. More than 260 people were injured, including at least 16 who lost legs in the explosions. Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements at his federal death penalty trial that he participated in the bombings but said he fell under the influence of his late older brother, Tamerlan, whom the defense has portrayed as the mastermind of the terror attack. Dr. Jennifer Hammers, the medical examiner who performed Campbell's autopsy, said she had wounds all over her body, including gaping wounds to her legs, third-degree burns to her back and numerous wounds from BBs and pieces of metal. She said she removed numerous pieces of flat metal and pellets embedded in Campbell's wounds. 'Many of them were very deep, through the whole surface of the skin into the muscle,' Hammers said. Campbell bled to death — but not immediately, Hammers said. 'Based on those injuries, you would estimate that she could have lived for up to a minute?' Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb asked. 'That's correct,' Hammers responded. On Monday, prosecutors plan to call two other medical examiners to testify about the deaths of 8-year-old Martin Richard, a Boston boy who was with his parents, sister and brother at the marathon, and 23-year-old Lingzu Lu, a graduate student at Boston University. After that testimony, prosecutors are expected to rest their case in the first phase of the trial, the guilt phase. Then the defense will present its case, which is expected to be brief since Tsarnaev's lawyers have admitted his guilt. During the second phase of the trial — known as the penalty phase — the same jury will decide if Tsarnaev is sentenced to death or spends the rest of his life in prison. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died days after the attacks when he was wounded during a gunbattle with police and run over by Dzhokhar as he escaped. Dzhokhar was found more than 18 hours later, hiding in a boat parked in a yard in Watertown. He faces the death penalty if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him which also include shooting dead a Boston police officer, Sean Collier. Boston Marathon bombing survivors Heather Abbott, left, and Karen Rand, center, are escorted from federal court on Wednesday after the first day of the trial . Karen McWatters went to the 2013 marathon with Campbell to watch her boyfriend run the race, she testified on the first day of trial. The pair were near the finish line so they could photograph McWatters' boyfriend when the bombs went off. Mrs McWatters said she remembered 'screaming and smoke' and wondered why she was lying on the ground. She looked at her leg and realized 'something terrible had happened to us'. The survivor kept her composure as she testified that although her foot was turned the wrong way and the ground so hot, she made it to Krystle and pressed their faces together. Mrs McWatters said: 'I didn't know how bad she was hurt. She said her legs hurt, then her hand went limp in mine and she never spoke again.'","A medical examiner testified in the Boston Marathon bombing case today, showing the jury autopsy photos of Krystle Campbell .

"Simone Jones (above), 45, of Brooklyn went into cardiac arrest during an $11,000 liposuction procedure at a New York plastic surgery clinic and was pronounced dead in hospital . A woman went into cardiac arrest during an $11,000 liposuction procedure at a New York plastic surgery clinic and was pronounced dead in hospital. Simone Jones, 45, of Brooklyn underwent the operation on February 9 at Lexington Plastic Surgeons in Manhattan when her heart rate dropped. At the time, her surgery was allegedly 98 per cent complete, the plastic surgeon, Dr. Alan Bienstock told Jones' daughter, Shantay. The cause of Simone's death remains under investigation as the city medical examiner awaits test results, and Jones' family lawyer has also demanded an investigation by the Department of Health, the New York Daily News. Simone, a mental health aide and mother-of-four, had saved the funds to pay for liposuction on her legs, arms and back, a buttocks lift and a tummy tuck. Shantay, 26, said her mother was looking forward to showing off her new look. 'She was very attractive and looked young for her age and she wanted the whole package. She took pride in her appearance,' she said. As she had spoken to her mother before she had gone in for the operation that morning, Shantay said she was called by the clinic hours after her mother had checked in. Simone underwent the operation on February 9 at Lexington Plastic Surgeons in Manhattan (pictured left) when her heart rate dropped. At the time, her surgery was allegedly 98 per cent complete, the plastic surgeon, Dr Alan Bienstock (right) told Jones' daughter, Shantay . She was told there was a complication and to go to Bellevue Hospital as soon as possible. When she arrived, Dr Bienstock along with other doctors shared the news about her mother, explaining that her heart rate dropped while they were working on her buttocks. 'Ms. Jones, an otherwise healthy woman went in for an ambulatory procedure and apparently her vital signs were not being properly monitored so as to allow this tragedy to occur,' said the family's lawyer, Scott Rynecki. Shantay said she never got a clear answer on what happened and that Dr Bienstock said it could have been a blood clot among other possibilities. Shantay Jones, 26, Simone's daughter said she never got a clear answer on what happened and that Dr Bienstock said it could have been a blood clot among other possibilities (above an operating room in Lexington Plastic Surgeons) When the clinic called the following day to express sympathy for the family's loss, Simone's aunt suggested the money be returned, but Dr Bienstock never got back in touch with them regarding it. Until they have answers, Shantay and her family will continue demanding for clarity concerning her mother's death. She said: 'I want answers. We are going to fight for her because she would have fought for us.' Shantay was told there was a complication and to go to Bellevue Hospital (file photo above) as soon as possible.

"Australians enjoying a cold beverage may begin to notice something very suspicious on their drink's label, thanks to a new dodgy knock-off which has infiltrated the market. People have taken to social media after spotting a major typo on the ‘Montheith’s Crushed Apple Cider’ labels, with many questioning if the person responsible had a tipple while working and made the error. It’s been revealed that an imitation product, deceivingly named ‘Monteeth’s Apple Flavour Cider’, is on shelves and is fooling many customers, as it sports an almost identical label to the original brand. Confused consumers have taken to social media to ask 'Monteiths' why there appears to be a strange typo on the label of some of their bottles . The original product: The Monteith's label to which the 'Monteeth's' product bears a striking resemblance . Pip the pup was completely suspicious when it came to identifying the knock-off version of the beverage . The original brand have issued a notice online to alert their customers to the 'imposter' product. ‘There have been some very cheeky Sydney-siders who have created a counterfeit version of our Monteith’s Crushed Apple Cider,’ a spokesperson for Monteith’s confirmed on Facebook. ‘While it’s perfectly safe to consume, the sketchy beverage is made with apple juice concentrate,’ they claimed. The replica's major difference to the real product is that the counterfeit is only 'apple-flavoured' because of the use of cheaper ingredients. Ahh! The sweet taste of a counterfeit 'apple flavour' cider on a Sunday afternoon . The original brand have issued a notice online to alert their customers to the 'imposter' product . There have been a number of posts on social media from people who are noticing the subtle difference on their drink label. ‘Discovered this suss typo – is this the real deal guys?’ asked one dissatisfied customer. ‘Nothing like kicking back on a Sunday & realising your cider is a counterfeit version!’ remarked another. Many were quick to point out that not only was the dodgy version missing the letter ‘i’, it was missing the freshness they were expecting, thanks to ‘Monteeths’ use of apple concentrate rather than New Zealand apples. For this apple cider consumer, the strange taste of the knock-off product alerted them to the fake . For some it was odd taste of the beverage which first alerted them to the mishap. ‘I noticed the flavour was off and then I saw the typo on the label (I should really pay more attention to what I am drinking! Lol),’ posted another. ‘Has something gone wrong with the new labels?? Is this even a Monteith product?’ they continued. ‘Has someone gotten into the cider before work?’ Monteith’s have asked customers to be on the lookout in bottle shops and to alert the company via their Facebook page or website if anyone spots the suspicious products.

"An Indiana couple who shocked doctors by naturally conceiving identical triplets welcomed their three daughters into the world on Thursday night. The event was one-in-a-million, medical professionals said, and Ashley and Matt Alexander, of Greenfield, outside Indianapolis, said they knew how they lucky they are. Sophia Mae and Alexis Kae weighed in at more than 4 pounds, while Ella Shae weighs 5 pounds, according to 6 ABC, and were born at 36 weeks. 'It's just an awesome blessing for God to entrust us with three more little blessings all at once,' Ashley told the Indiana network. Scroll down for video . They're here!: Indiana nurse Ashley Alexander and her husband Matt welcomed their incredibly rare identical triplets on Thursday night, calling the girls Sophia Mae, Alexis Kae and Ella Shae . But now comes the part of being able to tell each of them apart. While it will be easier as the girls grow up and develop their own characteristics and personalities, as babies it will be difficult. But Mrs Alexander thinks she has the answer - nail polish. She intends to keep track of the girls by painting each of their nails a different color - purple, pink or light blue. The couple were looking at an ultrasound when the technician told them they were expecting triplets. Mr Alexander asked whether the hospital worker was joking when he asked the technician to check.'Sir, we do not joke about this,' the technician said before telling Mr and Mrs Alexander about the triplets, the Greenfield Reporter reported. Ashley Alexander (left) and hubsand Matt of Greenfield, Indiana, were surprised weeks ago when they learned they were expecting three new additions to their family during a routine sonogram . 'Is this a joke?': Mr Alexander asked the technician to double check when she told the couple they were expecting triplets . While triplets have become more common with the rise of methods such as in vitro fertilization, having an identical trio naturally, where one egg is fertilized and splits into three separate embyros, is rare. One in a million is commonly reported as the odds of having natural identical triplets, though estimates range from one in 60,000 to one in 200million. There were in 4,600 triplets out of nearly 4 million US births in 2012 according to date from the Centers for Disease Control. However there is no record of how many were identical or how many births involved fertility treatments. The mother, who works as a part-time nurse, had hoped to wait until mid-February to give birth, with multiples often born early. Ashley's rapidly growing belly lead her to believe that there would be more than one child, though she and husband Matt did not expect triplets. She is seen here at her baby shower . Friends and family held a baby shower in January for the happy parents, who said that the triplets are a blessing. The couple will get help raising the girls from nearby relatives, and are buying in bulk for their bulging brood. 'Thank goodness for Sam's Club and Walmart,' Mrs Alexander, who estimates that the babies will go through 7,000 diapers in their first year, told RTV6. Mr Alexander works as a supervisor at a church-building company, and the couple hope to be able to continue working while splitting time caring for the Sophia, Alexis and Ella along with their two-year-old son, Stefan. Though friends have warned them about the difficulties ahead, the couple said they don't view the children as an inconvenience, but as something that 'makes marriage a family'. The Alexanders expect their new children in the coming weeks and may try to keep track of their girls by giving them different nail polish colors . After first finding out about the triplets in September, Mrs Alexander has been preparing to give birth for the past several months. She first started having contractions at work in December and still experiences them frequently. A rapidly growing belly first made her suspect that there was more than one child even before she knew . 'Just last night, I felt a kick on my left and a hit on my right; then, I’ll have one push here, one push there, and I’ll have one pounce on my bladder,' she said. The babies will be born through caesarean section, as the risks of naturally birthing the triplets are too high. The sisters will likely stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for several weeks. However doctors have said that Sophia, Alexis and Ella appear to be developing healthily.","Indiana couple Ashley and Matt Alexander welcome their identical triplets in Greenfield on Thursday night .

"There's a first time for everything, isn't there? First time in a new country. First time you go on a holiday that leaves you speechless. And the first time you take one of those 'selfies' that everyone is talking about. The country was Burma, which has  just started opening up to touris, and since the best way to see the sights is by taking a river cruise, I booked up for a few nights onboard. 'A floating paradise': A river cruise on the Sanctuary Ananda was the best way to see the sights . The brochure promised enchantment and luxury, along with the chance to experience this fascinating land close up. I have to say, they were true to their promise. The boat, Sanctuary Ananda, is basically a floating paradise. The first thing I did when I got to my cabin was throw open the French doors and step on to the veranda. The second thing was to clamber on to the fluffy nest of a bed and enjoy the sight of a new world sliding past my windows. At this point, I promised myself that one day I would lie there and watch the sunrise. Next morning, thanks to jet lag, that's exactly what I did. It was so superb, I set my alarm so I could enjoy it every day. Ox-cart ride anyone? Stan enjoyed his bumpy ride in the back of the taxi . The only way to see the temples.... from a balloon . Our guide later explained that the owners of Sanctuary Ananda, obviously aware of the negative impact tourism can sometimes have on real lives like these, are working with the village elders to plan for the future. The first fruits of this philanthropic project are a full-time teacher and a library in the village. The next few days passed in a blur of excitement. We stopped off to explore ancient ruins and temples that were still very much in use. One day I found myself wandering along a dusty path, wilting in the heat. I hailed a passing ox cart, which had the word 'taxi' scrawled on the side, and got a delightfully bumpy lift back to the shore. Next morning I was up before the sun had even thought about rising. I couldn't sleep, and couldn't face breakfast. Truth be told, I could hardly stop myself from doing a dance. The reason was simple. I live in Bristol, which is pretty much home of the hot air balloon. I've always wanted to go up in one of these outsized cuddly toys, but for one reason or another I've never got round to it. Until now. So there I was, on a gorgeous boat in a land of loveliness, crossing my fingers for good ballooning weather. Luckily, the wind stayed away and the captain announced that conditions were perfect. A few of us scampered up the bank and climbed into a vintage coach that would carry us to the take-off field. The balloon sighed into the sky just in time for the sun to rise over the 2,000 temples of Bagan. As balloon rides go, it was magical. The early morning sunlight shone through the mist, picking out temples and pagodas with golden sparks. That was when I decided it was time for my first selfie. I'm not saying it was the best picture I've ever taken, but it is definitely one click I am never going to forget. Days were spent exploring ancient ruins and temples that are still very much in use . Bagan at dusk: The ancient capital of Myanmar has more than 2,200 Buddhist temples and pagodas . On our last evening we were treated to a candlelit feast under the night sky. As I sat there thinking nothing could improve my world, a flurry of shooting stars whooshed overhead. Moments later, a harvest moon peeped over the horizon, lighting up the river. I actually had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. Our host, Daniel, saw my dazed look and asked if I could think of any way, no matter how big or small, in which the company could improve my holiday experience. I'll be honest, I tried. I really did. I gave it my full attention. I desperately tried to think of something I would have changed. But I couldn't think of a thing. Not a single, solitary one. I had to turn to Daniel and admit the truth. It had been the perfect holiday.

"Most people in Britain now think Scotland will become independent sooner or later despite last year's 'no' vote, a new study has revealed. Some 69 per cent of Scots now believe there will be a split while 59 per cent of those surveyed in England, 54 per cent in Wales and 59 per cent in Northern Ireland think the UK will eventually break up. The University of Edinburgh findings come after Labour leader Ed Miliband moved to rule out going into coalition with the SNP after the election amid growing concern over the prospect of a landslide for Nicola Sturgeon's party at the election in May. Most people in Britain now think Scotland will become independent sooner or later despite last year's 'no' vote in the referendum . The study also found that last year's record turnout for the referendum looks set to boost the number of Scots voting in the general election. Some 76 per cent of Scots said they will vote in May's election, compared to 63 per cent in England, 64 per cent in Wales and 55 per cent in Northern Ireland. The contrast is bigger among young people with 65 per cent of 18 and 19-year-olds in Scotland saying they will vote, compared to just 34 per cent in England. The survey also found that satisfaction with the UK's current constitutional arrangements varies. In England, 43 per cent believe their country receives less government spending than it is due while the figure is 44 per cent in Scotland, 37 per cent in Northern Ireland and 68 per cent in Wales. The researchers found that there is majority agreement that a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union (EU) should be decided by a majority of votes across the UK, instead of individual countries being allowed to veto the result. In Scotland, 45 per cent support a proposal that each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would have to vote in favour of an EU exit for it to happen. In the other countries, support is lower. Some 69 per cent of Scots now believe the UK will split up. The country's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has insisted the country will one day achieve independence . Alex Salmond has described the Prime Minister as a 'silly arrogant man' over his handling of the aftermath of the Scottish independence referendum. The former First Minister has told how he watched David Cameron's television address on the morning of September 19 and realised 'what must now be done'. Extracts of Mr Salmond's book The Dream Shall Never Die, his referendum diary looking back on the campaign for independence. He said he was 'disgusted' with Mr Cameron's decision to link further devolution for Scotland with English votes for English laws in the wake of the No vote on September 18, branding the Prime Minister 'a Tory toff on a day trip' for his interventions in the debate. His attack on Mr Cameron continued today, with his account of how he watched the Prime Minister's speech on television. 'As he struts out to say that Scottish reform must take place ""in tandem with"" and ""at the same pace as"" changes in England, I immediately realise the significance,' Mr Salmond said. 'There was no mention of this last week when he was in a complete panic about the polls. I think 'you silly arrogant man' and look around the room.' The book, which will be published on Thursday, comes as the SNP gears up to win a record number of seats in May's election. Polls indicate the nationalists could send over 50 MPs to Westminster, with Labour facing near wipeout. A majority of people would like all devolved administrations to have control over the same powers, the study found while most people said that not enough time has been spent discussing constitutional issues. Despite the views on constitutional issues, those surveyed do not believe 'ordinary people' have a big influence on how the UK is run. Politicians, parties, businesses, trade unions and local councils are seen to hold greater influence on the running of the country. The researchers also interviewed party campaigners, civil servants and politicians, including at least one member from each political party who sat on the Smith Commission on Scottish Devolution, as part of the study. The respondents who took part in the commission talks said their emphasis was on creating a good political solution in a tight time scale, but that 'they may have underestimated the public appetite for continued constitutional discussion', according to the study. Dr Jan Eichhorn, of the University of Edinburgh's School of Social and Political Science, said: 'People across the UK show an appetite for discussions about how the country should be governed. 'Seeing a lasting, positive effect on political engagement in Scotland beyond the referendum is encouraging and shows that people can be activated politically. However, it is worrying to see how little people think they can actually make a difference.' Dr Daniel Kenealy said: 'Despite Nicola Sturgeon's call for an EU referendum veto by the four nations of the UK, and First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones's support for the idea, it remains unpopular with people across the UK. 'This shows us that on some issues people across the UK still think in terms of a single political unit making big decisions.' Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney welcomed the findings on the level of political engagement north of the border. He said: 'The Scottish Government continues to believe independence is the best option for Scotland, and the survey finds most Scots think this is where the constitutional journey will take us. 'We also believe strongly that Scotland being taken out of the EU in a referendum in circumstances, where a majority of Scots had voted to stay in, would be massively damaging economically and have major constitutional implications. 'The referendum on independence was a wonderful experience of democratic engagement, bringing people into politics who in some cases had not been involved in decades, if at all.' A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said it is 'no surprise people fear the constitutional question isn't yet over' because of speculation over a possible partnership between Labour and the SNP at Westminster after the election. A Labour spokesman said: 'This poll shows that people are frustrated with the way that politics works, and they want to have a bigger say in how our country is run. Making our country work for working people is the best way to bring all parts of it together again. 'That is why Labour has committed to a constitutional convention, made up of people from all parts of the country and all walks of life, to change the way our country works.'","Seven out of 10 Scots now believe there will be a split sooner or later .

"Faced by a scantily-clad mannequin gazing back at you, this is not your everyday trip to the toilet. But one restaurant in Taiyuan, north east China, has decided to jazz up its toilets by installing the string of female figures around the urinals, the People's Daily Online reports.

All of the recipes come in individual, toilet-like vessels, from bidets to potties to - in the case of the ice cream - little cups, where the plumbing at the back forms a dainty handle for diners to hold their end-of-meal digestif. The restaurant itself is equipped to resemble a bathroom, with showers attached to the walls and seats that look like toilet bowls topped with cushions in the shape of large piles of poo. Toilet restaurants have become popular across China, with cities including Chonqing, Shanghai, Kunming and Hangzhou boasting their own toilet chains, and others in Korea and Japan.","Revealing mannequins have been fitted in restaurant toilet in Taiyuan .

"Hedge fund trader Julian Rifat leaked insider tips about companies including Barclays and Volkswagen in exchange for a luxury car and holiday . A hedge fund trader who leaked insider tips about companies including Barclays and Volkswagen in exchange for a luxury car and a family holiday to Oman has been jailed. Julian Rifat, 45, abused his senior position at Moore Capital to leak tips about eight major firms. He used the inside information to place trades worth £285,000 through an associate to top up his basic salary of £125,000 and £615,000 bonus. Rifat, who lived in a £1.2million home in Oxford, was today jailed for 19 months during a hearing at Southwark Crown Court. His prosecution was the ninth under Operation Tabernula - an investigation launched in the wake of the financial crisis by regulators the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Rifat, once dubbed the 'face' of the American hedge fund, faced a single charge of insider dealing between 1 June and 24 November 2009. Prosecutor Mark Ellison QC, for the FCA, said: 'The total value of all eight trades being £285,000, they were all in the form of spread bets. '[Rifat] was employed at the time of offending as a senior trader by Moore Capital. He was FCA approved at the time of the offences and had been for a number of years. 'He was in essence, on the evidence, the person at Moore Capital in London that senior bankers would approach to discuss transactions. 'He was effectively, to a considerable degree, the face of Moore Capital in that respect for the purpose of European investment decisions. 'In fact in Mr Rifat's own words he says he was somebody who had direct access to the top four people in the firm. He was somebody who clearly was in a very responsible and trusted position.' Rifat would be approached by investors about major deals before the information was communicated to the market in a practice known as 'wall crossing'. Jailed: Rifat, from Oxford, leaked insider tips on major deals involving Barclays (pictured) and Volkswagen . However, he would then use this information to tip-off associate Graeme Shelley, a broker at Novum Securities Ltd, who placed trades on his behalf. In return, Shelley, 45, paid around £60,000, including a £15,000 family trip to Oman and a brand new Range Rover. Mr Ellison said: 'Once the inside was wall crossed within the company the entire firm was restricted from trading in the stock sharing until a public announcement was made or the offer withdrawn. 'After he had been wall crossed, Mr Rifat would make the time to give Mr Shelley either a ring or a text so as to provide the inside information.' Rifat, who worked in the company's London offices, was first arrested on his 41st birthday in 2010. Despite being put on administrative leave by his employers, he was still paid his huge salary as well as two £700,000 payments as part of a 'compromise agreement'. Rex Tedd QC, for Rifat, said his client was being paid cash that was owed to him as unpaid bonuses from previous years. It was not a 'golden goodbye', he insisted. 'He is someone who made a career in this financial world. That took a huge amount of effort and a considerable degree of skill. 'The measure of how much he was earning is really the measure of how much he has thrown away through this dishonest conduct. 'What he has lost has been enormous and that can never be regained... he can never have any significant position within the world which he is suited.' As well as being given a brand new Range Rover, Rifat also accepted a £15,000 family holiday to Oman (file picture) in exchange for tip-offs . Sentencing Rifat, Judge Alistair McCreath, QC, said:  'There can be no doubt at all that in your employment you held a pivotal position, there was reposed in you a very high degree of trust. 'You were described by one of your witnesses in relation to wall crossing as the 'go-to man' so in the organisation for which you worked if there was a question of wall crossing it was to you they came and therefore this highly sensitive information initially to you. 'I must secondly have regard to the circumstances in which you came to be in possession of the confidential information and the use you made of it,' he said. 'It needs to be added that because this information came to you in relation to the eight episodes shortly before the information came public and therefore at a time when the clients could do nothing about market fluctuation. The information was very sensitive indeed. 'The use you made of it is clear, that you have quickly given that information to Mr Shelley who then used it to make unlawful profit.' Sentencing Rifat to 19 months in prison, the judge added: 'I know the impact this will have on your family and I would if it were possible wish to suspend it, but I'm afraid I cannot. 'This sort of offending is serious in the way I have described and must, save in the most exceptional cases, be marked by an immediate term of imprisonment.' The trader was sentenced to 19 months in prison during a hearing at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) The trader was also fined £100,000 and ordered to pay prosecution costs of £159,402. Shelley and another associate Paul Milsom, an equity dealer at Legal and General, had already pleaded guilty to insider dealing. Georgina Philippou, acting director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: 'Mr Rifat's behaviour exploited financial markets during a particularly challenging time just as they were taking steps to recover from the 2008 crisis. 'The smooth running of our financial markets requires market professionals to play by the rules - Mr Rifat knew the rules, but he abused them for his own benefit.' In a statement released through his lawyers after the sentencing, Rifat said he was 'deeply disappointed' at being jailed. He said: 'After five years of essentially feeling like I have been in open prison and all the uncertainty and delay related to the investigation I truly feel that I have already served my time. 'Whilst I am apologetic and remorseful for the nonsensical offences that I have pleaded guilty to today, I take issue with much of the prosecution's assertions.'","Julian Rifat abused his senior position at Moore Capital to leak trading tips .

"As most kids were spending their school break heading off on vacation or sitting at home, Ashima Shiraishi was busy breaking some very longstanding world records. The 13-year-old from New York City has become the newest, and youngest, rock star in the world of rock climbing, and prove just how amazing she was with one very difficult climb. By conquering Open Your Mind Direct, a notoriously difficult rock wall in Santa Linya, Spain. she became the first woman and the youngest person ever to make it up the challenging crag. And it only took her about 10 minutes. Scroll down for video . Ashima Shiraishi (above), 13, of New York City broke two major world records when she climbed Open Your Mind Direct in Spain last week .

'For every hard climb, especially Open Your Mind Direct, the hardest part is the mental game.' What's more, the already daunting climb was made even harder as the climb became even harder since a key hold, which climbers use to attach themselves to the wall as they move up the face, has broken off a while back, and since then no one has been able to successfully complete the climb, which is rated a 5.15a. No one, that is, until Ashima. And like most kids her age, she celebrated her victory the best way she knew how - with ice cream. Ashima, who says she loves to hang out with friends and eat when she is not rock climbing, celebrated her big climb with some ice cream . The daughter of Japanese immigrants, who began climbing when she was just 6, is ready for more challenges now, and knows that she and other girls can handle them just as well as the boys. She said; 'I think that now it’s not always the guys that are pushing the limits; it's also girls who are strong and focused and inspired to climb.'","Ashima Shiraishi, 13, of New York City broke two major world records when she climbed Open Your Mind Direct in Spain last week .

If you don't have the time to make chocolate from scratch, you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs. Once your chocolate is melted, it will need to be tempered. The cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along, just pop your chocolate into the freezer (no longer than 30 seconds). Place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it. Keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process. Stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature. Bittersweet/ dark chocolate should reach a temperature of 28C-29C;  milk chocolate should reach 27C-28C; and white or coloured chocolate should reach 26C-27C. Once the first batch has melted, add more chocolate to your bowl, stirring as you go along. As soon as the correct temperature is reached, start building your Easter egg layers. Spoon some chocolate into a mould (you can get them from Lakeland, Denny Craft Moulds or Party Delights) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould. You can make it as thick as you like, building each layer as the previous one cools. Once the final layer has been built, leave aside to cool and harden before decorating.","Chocolate creation being raffled for charity Dame Vera Lynn Trust .

"A 19-year-old mother burst into tears when the prosecutor demanded she spend 15 years in a  Bali prison today - but spared her the death penalty. Heather Mack and her 21-year-old boyfriend Tommy Schaefer were in court accused of murdering Heather's mother, Sheila Von Wiese-Mack in a plush Bali hotel last August and then stuffing her body in a suitcase. The Prosecution at Denpasar District Court also want Schaefer to be sentenced to 18 years in jail and tears rolled down his face when he heard the news through an interpreter. Scroll down for video . Heather Mack smiles at her baby daughter Stella before her sentencing hearing in Denpasar, Bali, today . Mack wept as prosecutors said she should be sentenced to 15 years - but spared her the death penalty . There was a rare glimpse of baby Stella's face as she was carried from Bali's Kerobokan prison to court . Her co-accused, boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, was seen clutching his baby daughter for the first time today . The 21-year-old from Chicago also cried as translators relayed the news that prosecutors want him to serve an 18-year sentence over the death of Mack's mother, Sheila Von Wiese-Mack . 19-year-old Mack, looking at her child, was told she had 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother', but the prosecutors said they had been 'lenient as she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby' A teary and nervous looking Mack puffed on a cigarette as she waited to hear what sentence would be demanded by the prosecutor . Mack was told by the chief prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya she had 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother', but was spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby'. Since being held in jail, the 19-year-old from Chicago has been keeping her 15-day old baby, Stella, with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison. In a bizarre comment from her holding cell today, Mack said with a grin that Stella has six fingers on her left hand, saying: 'But don't worry, she's OK, thank you.' As she waited in the cell, nervously puffing on a cigarette, Mack added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married 'in spirit'. She said: 'He has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison. She held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring. 'Tommy's is blue,' she added. It will now be up to the defence team to try to get the sentence reduced, or even thrown out. The court will resume next week when the defence begins its case. Jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime. A teary Mack hears the prosecution case today and her and Schaefer's defence lawyers will begin their arguments to have the sentence reduced - or the case thrown out - next week . The 19-year-old from Chicago looks glum and downbeat as she cradles baby Stella in a holding cell . Schaefer, 21, bows his head in the dock - he has admitted killing his girlfriend's 62-year-old mother, battering her to death with the metal handle from a heavy fruit bowl . The 21-year-old gazes at his baby daughter, held by a relative, before his sentence demand hearing . Schaefer was spotted gently holding his baby daughter, Stella, for the first time today in his holding cell . Mack has said she never wanted her mother to die, but 'panicked' after her boyfriend attacked her in the hotel . Mack looked protective of her young daughter as she was greeted by a scrum of photographers at court . Mack claimed her daughter - who had to return to hospital shortly after her birth with jaundice - has six fingers on her left hand . Dressed in matching orange waistcoats, the couple are escorted by a court officer to the courtroom . Schaefer has admitted hitting the victim with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the boot of a taxi they had ordered. The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit. They tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel - and Mack was allegedly the only person who had permission to open the box. Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel. Mack, who said during an earlier court hearing that she did not wish her mother dead, said they panicked after Schaefer’s attack with the metal bowl. She said they thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the US Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. When the prison gates opened today to take the couple, who are separated inside, to the court, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella - the first time he had been seen with her . 'Everything to live for': Mack and her boyfriend Schaefer (holding Stella) have been spared the death penalty . Mack has revealed that she is breast-feeding baby Stella in prison rather than give her formula milk . The child has lived in her mother's prison cell, despite hygiene concerns, since being treated for jaundice . The requested sentences of 15 and 18 years for Mack and her boyfriend have surprised many osbervers for their leniency . Shortly after the baby's birth Mack was being accused by prison sources of failing to wash the child properly . Mack has been keeping the baby with her in her crowded prison since the child was born this month . Polydactyly is a medical term used to describe extra fingers on the hands or toes on the feet. The extra fingers or toes may be small and non-functional,  or they may be fully formed with bones and joints. Extra digits can exist in different places on the hands and feet. Extra digits can also be located in the centre of the hand or foot, and people with polydactyly often have extra digits on both hands or feet. Polydactyly occurs when the body follows a different set of directions than usual while forming the hands or feet during development. It is inhertited and can be passed on by just one parent if they have the disorder. Researchers are still discovering the genes that cause extra digits. But the trait may exist as part of a syndrome, which is a group of several recognisable clinical features that often occur together. Source: National Institutes of Health . When the prison gates opened today to take the couple - who are separated inside - to the court, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella as it was the first time he had been seen with her. After arriving at court, it was Mack who held the baby when she and her boyfriend emerged from the prison van. They were led to separate holding cells and Mack sat at the rear of hers with her arms wrapped around the baby, who was covered in a white shawl. She was observed breastfeeding the baby under the garment. The child was then handed to Schaefer, who lowered his face to her head and began tenderly kissing his daughter. 'He looked every part like the doting father,' said a photographer. 'It was the kind of scene you'd see anywhere in a playground for example - but he was behind bars. 'It seemed a bit strange to be seeing something like that.' Mack said she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years. A woman looking after the couple claim they were not using the child as a way to sway judges' feelings. The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice. The child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother. A woman looking after the couple claim they were not using the child to sway judges' feelings . A friend admitted that the appearance of the child would help to support the couple's insistence that they had a reason to be allowed to live . The baby had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice . The couple sported his-and-hers plastic and coloured rings, made by Schaefer in prison . The hearing will now move onto the next stage - when the argument is put forward by the defence. It is estimated that it will be at least a month before the judges make the final decision on whether the pair are guilty. Mack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women - until the child is two years old. She revealed there was another prison baby, aged seven months, in a separate cell.","Prosecutor demands Heather Mack spend 15 years in a Bali prison .

"Fears the notorious FLDS cult is planning to expand have been sparked after the brother of imprisoned leader Warren Jeffs applied to increase the water supply to the group's South Dakota compound. Seth Jeffs wants to double the amount of water it can draw from an aquifer in the 140-acre compound about 30 miles from Mount Rushmore. His request prompted concerns from neighbors and law enforcement about the possibility of members being displaced from their enclave on the Utah-Arizona border. He told state authorities that members of the United Order of South Dakota, a trust run by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) need more water for gardens, orchards and herds of animals. Seth Jeffs (pictured left), the brother of imprisoned cult leader Warren Jeffs (right) has applied to double the water available to the group's South Dakota compound, sparking fears of an influx of members there . Women and girls from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) can be seen wearing prairie dresses in Hildale, Utah . But with few details available and considering the group's troubled history, residents are worried members are planning a mass exodus from other areas to make Black Hills their new home. Warren Jeffs and other church leaders have been convicted of sexually assaulting underage girls . And while Seth Jeffs pleaded guilty in 2006 to harboring his then-fugitive brother, he did not face any sex abuse charges. South Dakota officials said that the local members of the FLDS, a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism, have never been in trouble with the law there. But Linda Van Dyke Kilcoin, one of several neighbors who filed petitions to intervene in the group's water request, said: 'As locals, we know what is going on in there and we don't want to see it expand. 'We value our 12-year-old girls in South Dakota.' An aerial shot shows buildings inside Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound near Pringle, South Dakota. The sect has applied to double the amount of water it can take from an aquifer . A log-cabin-style home is among the buildings on the FLDS compound that has nearly 50,000 square feet of residential space . Seth Jeffs declined to comment to The Associated Press, but told a local newspaper in January the compound is 'not growing right now' and members 'just need more water.' The request for more will likely be acted on in May. But Ms Kilcoin doubts it's for crop production. 'They're not going to irrigate. You ever been to Pringle? It's bedrock,' she said. 'You can't grow anything down there. They're bringing in a whole pile of people.' The group has said about 75 people live at the South Dakota ranch, according to a 2014 drinking water report filed with the state. The fenced-in compound, complete with a guard tower, sits on hilly, rugged land the group bought about 10 years ago - and was valued at $5.3 million for tax purposes. Inside the complex are seven large residences totaling nearly 50,000 square feet, a chapel and school, greenhouse, and several farm buildings. A sign warning against trespassing and dump trucks can be seen in operation on the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound about 30 miles from Mount Rushmore . Attorney General Marty Jackley, who said he's 'generally aware' of the activity at the compound, said the permit request and ongoing construction at the site 'are all indications that there is some level of expansion going on.' Mr Jackley said the group is on his radar because of what has gone on at FLDS sites in other states, and the additional law enforcement resources any expansion might require. Warren Jeffs is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2011 of abusing underage girls he considered his brides. Willie Jessop, who is Warren Jeffs' former bodyguard but left the cult in 2011, says he believes the group could be planning a move to South Dakota . For decades, members of his church have controlled the twin cities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, but some are now being squeezed out by authorities ordering evictions because people haven't paid millions in overdue occupancy fees. Last year, the Texas government seized the group's Eldorado compound on the basis that the FLDS leaders financed a $1.1 million land purchase in 2003 through money laundering. Custer County Sheriff Rick Wheeler, whose jurisdiction includes the Black Hills compound, said when the group was evicted from its Texas property there was no indication they had moved to the compound near Pringle, citing a low level of traffic and activity. But now, he said that has changed and the group is hauling in more gravel and lumber. 'It's churning right now,' he said. Both Sam Brower, a private investigator who has spent years researching the FLDS, and Willie Jessop, Warren Jeffs' former bodyguard, agreed leaders could be preparing to move people to South Dakota from the shrinking Utah-Arizona enclave. Mr Brower said 'I think they are looking for places to move the elite,' adding that Seth Jeffs, like his brother, is considered royalty among devout members. Unlike most Mormons, members of FLDS believe polygamy will bring exaltation in heaven. Loyalists consider Jeffs a prophet who speaks for God and can do no wrong. Seth Jeffs, who originally sought to triple the amount of water the South Dakota ranch could draw, recently told the state he was scaling back his request to relieve the 'fears and concerns' of the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service. William Hansen, chief of the Water Rights Branch of the NPS, said its main concern is the effect an additional well, without stricter limitations on usage, could have on Wind Cave National Park, since the FLDS draws from the same aquifer that has been forming the cave for millennia. A US flag flies at the compound built for polygamist Warren Jeffs, in defiance of his rules, in Hildale, Utah. It was converted into a bed and breakfast by his former bodyguard Willie Jessop .

"Britain is facing gridlock this Easter weekend as engineering works on the railways will lead to long queues during the Bank Holiday getaway. As many as 16 million motorists are set to take to the roads over Easter, with four million travelling on Good Friday and 4.5 million on Easter Sunday. Disruption to the train lines coupled with the gloomy weather forecast, has meant Britain's roads will be even busier than usual for the Easter break. Drivers could face travel misery this Easter as disruption to railways will see more people opt to use their cars . More people are planning to drive because of works on the rail network and a surge in people travelling abroad to seek sunshine . 'The first spring bank holiday of the year traditionally heralds the start of busier weekends on the nation's roads,' said RAC head of external affairs Pete Williams. He went on: 'This Easter is set to be a hectic one with 16 million of us getting behind the wheel for an Easter break, but at least we will benefit from the longer days and lighter evenings to complete our journeys.' Despite the surge in traffic, the Highways Agency (which becomes Highways England on April 1) is maintaining 55 sets of roadworks over the Bank Holiday weekend. Parts of the M1, M3, M4 and M6 likely to be hit by lane closures or speed restrictions. However, the agency said that 62 other roadworks would be temporarily lifted to ease the congestion. The increase in the number of people planning to travel by car is thought to have been in part triggered by a significant shutdown of the rail network. A string of engineering projects is expected to cause delays and overcrowding on some of Britain's busiest lines. Work is planned on three key routes - the West Coast main line, First Great Western and Greater Anglia - forcing passengers to make diversions on slower trains or spend hours on the dreaded replacement coaches. Network Rail said engineering works were planned over the Easter holidays because passenger numbers fell by 20 per cent. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'More than 90 per cent of the rail network is unaffected by our improvement work but a few lines are significantly impacted and passengers should check our website before travelling. 'The work is designed to improve the railway delivering new facilities, new signalling, new bridges, new track and flyovers all to give passengers a better, more reliable railway.' This map shows the traffic hotspots, rail closures and delays that are due to take place this Easter weekend . Last Christmas, thousands of passengers were crammed together outside Finsbury Park station, a small commuter stop in north London, in freezing conditions because Kings Cross had failed to reopen . In a move that has been described by an expert as 'adding insult to injury', Virgin Trains and London Midland have cancelled advanced cheap fares forcing passengers to purchase more expensive off-peak tickets. Both Virgin and London Midland say they cannot offer advance fares as the tickets would not be valid with other operators and replacement services. A trip from London to Manchester will cost £82 instead of the usual £15 advanced single ticket and take three hours, 53 minutes for a trip via Sheffield, compared to the usual two hours, eight minutes direct service. A journey from London to Liverpool will see passengers fork out £31.50 instead of £12 for a six-hour trip that involves four trains and a bus, instead of the normal direct service taking three hours, 16 minutes. Ian Baldry, of IBPTS consultants, told the Sunday Express: 'It's a rip-off. Paying more for journeys taking longer adds insult to injury. 'Passengers should be entitled to reduced, not increased, fares when engineering works affect journeys.' A Virgin Trains spokesman said: 'All Easter weekend trains in and out of London Euston to all destinations have not had usual discounted advance fares made available. 'Advance fares are only available on our services and due to the engineering works, there will not be any Virgin Trains services to travel on.' London Midland said: 'We’re unable to offer usual advance fares from London through the Trent Valley, to Birmingham and Northampton from Good Friday; and from Saturday lunchtime also for journeys from Birmingham to Liverpool. 'Advance fares are for particular trains. Engineering work means there is no way to put advance purchase fares on buses or alternative operators’ services.' Terry Oliver, London Midland's Head of West Coast services, has even encouraged passengers to avoid travelling this Easter. He said: 'London Midland will be running rail-replacement bus services over the Bank Holiday weekend, but journeys will involve changes and will take much longer than normal.' A string of engineering projects is expected to cause delays and overcrowding on some of the busiest lines . Last Christmas, Mark Carne, the chief executive of Network Rail, was forced to forego his annual bonus worth up to £135,000 after chaos on the railways caused by over-running engineering projects. Thousands of passengers were crammed together outside Finsbury Park station, a small commuter stop in north London, in freezing conditions because Kings Cross had failed to reopen. Mr Carne said: 'Our improvement programme this Easter is focused on delivering a better service for passengers. 'We are acutely conscious that many people want to use the railway during the holidays, which is why the vast majority of the network is running normally over the holiday period - but there will be disruption for some. 'I would like to apologise to any passengers whose plans are affected by our improvement work, but I hope they will understand that this is a quieter time on the railway and we want to minimise the overall impact of these vital projects on passengers.' The gloomy weather forecast this Bank Holiday weekend will increase the traffic on Britain's roads as travellers go abroad in search of sunshine. Figures from Gatwick airport show that more than two million passengers are expected to fly off for foreign holidays over the Easter break - a four per cent rise on the same period last year. Almost 50,000 more people than last year have bought air tickets for travel over the Easter weekend compared with last year. Barcelona, Dublin and Malaga are the most popular destinations.","Engineering works on railways will see long queues this Easter weekend .

"Each and every time you board a plane, it can sometimes seem as though the flight attendants and pilots are communicating in an entirely different language. Whether barking codes to each other over the loudspeaker or simply relaying news in difficult-to-understand abbreviations, it's not uncommon for passengers to wonder just what exactly is going on. Now British Airways Senior First Officer, Mark Vanhoenacker, has spoken to MailOnline Travel to reveal the most unusual jargon used on flights, and what it really means... British Airways Senior First Officer and author, Mark Vanhoenacker, shares the strangest in-flight jargon . The Heavy . 'This isn't a reference to my waistline!' Vanhoenacker tells MailOnline Travel. 'British Airways will always have tow pilots flying at any one time, but will have three and sometimes four pilots on its long-haul services, such as those flights to Singapore or Buenos Aires. 'The heavy pilot takes turns flying, allowing one of the other pilots to take a break.' The en-suite fleet . 'This is an affectionate term for the 747 fleet,' he explains. 'The 747 has not just a very cosy bunk in which to take our breaks - on flights with heavy crew, that is - but also has a toilet inside the cockpit.' Positioning refers to when crew members travel as passengers, often when a route is switching upon arrival . Positioning . 'This occurs when crew members travel as passengers,' Vanhoenacker reveals. Often it happens when 'a route is switching to a new aircraft type and a crew must already be in place overseas to bring the first flight home.' 'It has a more colourful name in North America: deadheading. 'To remember, just think Frank Abagnale Jr. and the film Catch Me If You Can.' There-and-backs are routes that allow the crew to make it back home - to London - in time for dinner . There-and-back . 'It sounds like something Tolkien would have written about, but for an air crew, it refers to a trip that runs from home - London  to a city like Rome or Stockholm and then back on the same day. 'There-and-backs are always popular,' he adds. 'We may even land in time for dinner! 'If we do have to stay the night in a hotel, it's called a nightstop.' Every airline has their own call-sign, and for British Airways, all aircraft identify themselves as 'speedbirds' Speedbird . 'Every airline has its own call-sign, which consists of a name followed by a version of the flight number,' Vanhoenacker explains. 'For many airlines, the call-sign is simply the name of the airline, but the British Airways call-sign is 'speedbird,' a name with plenty of history behind it. 'For example then, British Airways flight 117 from Heathrow to New York will identify itself on the radio as Speedbird 117.' Pilots often refer to air traffic controllers who align and space out arriving jets at a busy airport as 'Directors' Yes, they have a few oft-used phrases, too. Slam-click(er) Air stewardess Sarah Steeger, who works for a US carrier, explains that this is when a crew member goes to the hotel and does not emerge again until it’s time to leave. As in: slamming the door and clicking the lock. End of story. Can be used as a noun or a verb. ('I’m so tired I’m just gonna slam-click.' or 'You won’t see her for dinner. She’s a slam-clicker.)’ Pink eye . Similar to a red eye flight, a pink eye is just short of a long-haul overnight journey. A red eye is a flight that touches the 1 am hour, according to flight attendant, Blissom Booblé, so a flight that goes to midnight would be a pink eye. Coach roach . Used wryly, usually for flight attendants who prefer working in the main/coach cabin. 'Business? No thanks. I’m a coach roach all the way, baby!' Crotch watch . Nickname for walking through the cabin to do a seatbelt check. Also called a 'groin scan'. The Director . No, it's not the name of an upcoming Arnold Schwarzenegger film, it's the term applied to certain air traffic controllers. 'Those who align and space out arriving jets at a busy airport are called directors,' he says. 'When pilots, landing at Heathrow for example, hear that it's time to contact the Heathrow director, it's a sign that one of the most finely choreographed parts of the flight is about to begin.' The Sin Bin . 'This is the area of the taxiways near a runway where an aircraft may be sent to wait - out of the way of other aircraft. 'Typically, it occurs if a flight has a time restriction on its departure, either because its direction of flight is busier than that of other aircraft or because there's inclement weather at its destination.' Moral of the story? When you hear this term, you may want to send a quick text to let your loved ones know you'll be landing late. Pilots often make reference to the jets, which is the streaming quality of the air, when looking at weather charts . The jets . You may think that this is in reference to the gigantic planes that the pilots are captaining, but it's actually in reference to jet streams: the very high, fast winds that speed or impede the aircraft's journey. 'The 'jet' in jet stream comes from the streaming quality of the air, not the aircraft we most associate with them,' Vanhoenacker explains. 'Though it is a pleasing coincidence. 'I might ask where the jets are this morning while looking at a weather chart or in flight we may comment on how strong the jets are.' Often, the airline staff is required to report the total number of customers and crew, called souls on board . Souls on board . 'When we operate at certain airports, we're required to report the total number of customers and crew on the aircraft,' he adds. 'We call this souls on board.' 'In aviation, which has so much new terminology and technological jargon, this is one of those pleasing phrases that sounds all but antique.' Essentially, this a fancy name for the plane's head count. Senior First Office Mark Vanhoenacker is also the author of the upcoming book, Skyfaring: A Journey with a Pilot, which will be available in stores and online on April 2.","Pilots and flight attendants use some strange sayings while on board .

"Queen of thieves: Margaret Johnson has been banned from Birmingham city centre for five years . A thief dubbed the 'Queen of pickpockets', who has 77 previous convictions, has been banned from entering her local city centre for five years. Margaret Johnson, 38, targeted four shoppers - including a 90-year-old pensioner - in a matter of minutes in January this year. She was then jailed for 43 weeks. But the 'professional' pickpocket has now also been given a criminal behaviour order, which prevents her from entering Birmingham city centre - or she risks going back to prison. The 90-year-old woman had been using a walking frame while browsing shops in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. Johnson, of no fixed address, then snatched her handbag and purse, stealing her pension and personal belongings. Other victims included a new mother whose handbag was lifted from her toddler's pushchair and a customer at Clarks who suddenly realised her bag was stolen while she tried on shoes. Johnson has made a living out of sneakily stealing bags and purses from distracted parents, the elderly and foreign students around the city. Sergeant Ifty Ahmed, from Birmingham West and Central offender management team, said: 'CCTV linked Johnson to the offences and she was jailed for a total of 43 weeks earlier this year. 'The CBO granted on Monday gives us a huge degree of control over her behaviour and will prevent Johnson from visiting her usual haunts to commit crime.' Exclusion zone: Johnson's ban, which includes the busy Bullring shopping centre, comes after a 43-week jail sentence after she targeted four shoppers in a matter of minutes in January this year . He added: 'This professional pickpocket had no regard for the victims she targeted or the trauma she caused them by stealing their personal possessions. 'Her movements were calculated and her actions deliberate. If she is caught in the city centre over the next five years she will be brought before the courts and could be jailed. 'Pickpockets love to work in crowded spaces and prey on innocent shoppers so although this is a great result I would urge anyone to remain alert when out in busy places.' In addition to the ban from Birmingam city centre, Johnson is prohibited from entering Poundland, Clarks Shoes, Iceland, ASDA, Deichman shoes UK, McDonald's, Farmfoods, Oasis, Next and Mothercare in the West Midlands area. Banned: The thief has made a career out of stealing bags and purses from distracted parents, the elderly and foreign students in the city.

"The starting pistol has been fired on the campaign to pack bars and clubs in Magaluf with thrill-seeking British teenagers this summer. After new lows were plumbed by venues in the Majorcan resort last year, clubs are gearing up for another summer of binge drinking, sun, sea and sex. Clubs linked to the one where a girl performed sex acts on 24 men last July are advertising positions for 'podium dancers' over the coming summer. Meanwhile Carnage Magaluf, the company who organised the now infamous event, is already signing youngsters up for 'unlimited free shots' on £30 'booze cruises'. Scroll down for video . Bars and clubs in Magaluf are playing on the resort's reputation in ad campaigns targeting British teens . Nightclub promoters in Magaluf have begun tweeting messages to bring in youngsters this summer . The Carnage Magalluf firm is even trading off the back of events last summer, tweeting: 'Who's ready for the world famous bar crawl starting in April?' The firm's website is now advertising VIP pool parties, jungle sessions and bar crawls alongside images of a barman pouring spirits into a young woman's mouth in a so-called 'dentist's chair' position. It comes as police on the Spanish island are given new powers to seize drinks from tourists on the street between 10pm and 8am. There will also be tougher restrictions bar crawls and fines for 'balconing' - a craze for jumping off hotel balconies which has led to several deaths. Authorities are also in talks to fly in British police to patrol the streets over the height of the summer season. But those organising the bar crawls have shrugged off the new controls, which they fear could deter youngsters wanting to let loose. Organisers of the Carnage Magaluf bar-crawl, at which a British teenager was encourage to perform sex acts on 24 men last year, have played on their notoriety while others insist new rules will not affect street drinking . Adverts are being sent out adversing cocktails for just one euro (80 pence) in many bars in the resort . The Magaluf 2015 Twitter feed posted a message saying: 'Absolute nonsense about drinking laws in #Magaluf. Clubs still open till 6am, bars open until 4am, some bars open at 6am!' It also posted a photo of bikini-clad girls covered in red liquid with the caption: 'I can't wait to be ashamed of all the things I do in Magaluf 2015', adding 'Don't believe the hype, the Magaluf street drinking ban isn't going to change anything this summer!'. Bars are already advertising their one euro drinks deals - with cocktails called 'f***** hammered', 'scruffy cow' and 'f***** up', described as a 'nine spirit mix', all available for less than a pound. The resort was shamed last summer when a video emerged of an 18-year-old girl from Northern Ireland performing sex acts on 24 men, who lined up in the resort's Alex's Bar. Witnesses said the girl had agreed to perform the sex act after being told by party organisers she would win a 'holiday'. But her prize reportedly turned out to be a cocktail named 'Holiday', made from gin, vodka, peach schnapps, blackcurrant liqueur and fruit juice.

"Most pensioners keep busy in their retirement by taking water-colour classes or tending to their allotment. But Colin Francome, from Colindale, north London, has found an alternative way to stay active in his old age - by dating multiple partners and going to sex parties. The 70-year-old has been frequenting wild swingers events in Hertfordshire populated by other kinky pensioners for more than 25 years. Colin Francome has been attending sex parties for 25 years and says they are a great way to stay active . Colin said: 'It's good fun to go to parties - especially if you like sex. wrote a book called Improving Men's Health and found that men who had more sex were healthier than men who had less sex. 'Sex is for fun - and if you can't have a bit of fun in life, where are you? What are you here for?' And as Colin's X-rated tales make clear, these parties are definitely not for the frail or faint-hearted. 'I've seen some wild things in my time - at one party there was a man in his mid 60s who brought along a younger woman in her early forties,' he said. 'She was just going around making out with all of the older guys in the house, I couldn't help but watch. Colin, who is a keen juggler, says he is currently seeing six women aged 29-66 . Colin added: 'Afterwards he said to me ""it's a lot of fun, we can enjoy talking about it afterwards"".' The ex-academic, a former sociology professor at Middlesex University, now works as a part-time clown - and his juggling skills come in handy in his love life. Colin currently has six women - who range from 29 to 66 in age - on the go at the same time. He said: 'I love sex, I'd say I have it at least twice a week - which I think at my age is pretty good. I've been monogamous for maybe a year or two years but it just didn't work for me - I like variety. 'I'm known to my friends as someone who's had a few relationships in my time. But I'm not in a monogamous relationship, so it's not as if I'm betraying anyone.' Colin achieves his doctorate in philosophy in an award ceremony at Middlesex University in July 1981 . Colin during his time as a professor of sociology at Middlesex University . While for some pensioners, the passion of youth is a distant memory, Colin's sex drive is still up to speed, although these days he requires chemical assistance in the form of Viagra - which he gets free on the NHS - to keep up with the demands of his harem. He added: 'At my age it can be difficult to get erections, so I went to my GP and he prescribed me Viagra. 'At first it was dear, it worked out at £110 for 16 tablets - that's about £7 per session of nookie! It's much cheaper now since the patent lapsed, but these days I get it free on the NHS. 'I only need to take half a tablet, but I've got a friend who takes two - just to make sure.' And despite the numerous notches on his bedpost, Colin says he long ago gave up trying to remember the number of women he has bedded. Colin has written a book entitled The True Sexual Behaviour of the British which he proudly holds . Professor Colin works part time as a clown, here he shows off his juggling batons . He said: 'I stop counting when I got to 25 in my twenties - but it's definitely more than 100. 'That only works out at a bit over one a year - although even now, I doubt a year would go by without me gaining a new partner.' And far from being seedy, the silver-haired lothario is keen to paint his womanising as a form of public service. He said: 'When you are younger you've got a lot of sexual urges but there's not that many women around because a lot of them will be locked up by their father. 'But when you're old like me, there's lots of women available because a lot of the men have died off - so I can offer support to several women. I like to think that what I do is noble.' Colin attends swinging parties with his friends, notoriously at swinging parties people throw their keys into a bowl in order to find themselves new partner . Colin poses with his son Will, Colin has four different children by three different women . Colin is due to appear in OAPs Behaving Badly, a new Channel 5 series showcasing the lives of Britain's wildest pensioners. The twice-divorced, Strongbow-loving academic has four children by three different women - as well as a coterie of regular lovers around the globe. In the UK they include a GP who is a long-term lover, one of his female bridge partners, and a woman from Sierra Leone who he met when supervising her phD and now lives in the UK. However, Colin also has sexual partners overseas, including a 29-year-old lady in Zambia, and a retired social worker in America. And while his sexual exploits may be unusual among men his age, he has no plans to give up his womanising ways any time soon. 'I hope I'm still going when I'm 90,' he added.

"Stars have filled Westminster Abbey for a service in memory of actor and Oscar-winning film director Richard Attenborough. Film veteran Lord Attenborough, who dominated the British film business for more than half a century, died last August at the age of 90. His brother, TV wildlife presenter Sir David Attenborough, chose to read from Richard's maiden speech in the House of Lords during the ceremony. He said: 'The arts are not a prerequisite of the privileged few; nor are they the playground of the intelligentsia. The arts are for everyone - and failure to include everyone diminishes us all.'' His comments, in front of Dame Judi Dench, Sir Ben Kingsley, and Michael Caine, come as the debate continues about the lack of opportunities for working-class youngsters in the arts. Sir Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Hurt and Dame Judi Dench, Robert Lindsay,  former Chelsea footballer Gianfranco Zola and Labour politician Peter Hain were among those seen arriving at the service of thanksgiving in Westminster Abbey. Scroll down for video . A star-studded memorial to film legend Richard Attenborough has been held in the majestic quarters of Westminster Abbey in central London, with readings from his brother David . The 2,000-strong congregation at the 'service of thanksgiving' for Lord Attenborough's life and work was also amused when Sir David Attenborough, the naturalist and broadcaster, read an extract from his late brother's maiden speech to the House of Lords, which began: 'I have it on the best authority – from a not too distant relative – that we are related to apes' Sir Ben Kingsley, who played the title role in Lord Attenborough's film Gandhi, gave readings from the film. They included: 'There are no goodbyes,' then the final: 'Wherever you'll be, you'll be in my heart' After suffering a stroke and falling down a flight of stairs in 2008, Lord Attenborough was left unable to read, write, walk and speak properly . The Dean of Westminster, the very reverend Dr John Hall, said: 'We come to celebrate the life and achievement of Richard Attenborough, a truly great man: certainly a star of stage and screen, but also a pioneer film-maker, an exemplary leader of his profession, a man of deep commitment, of great generosity of spirit, and of personal warmth.' He added: 'We shall also pray that his story might continue to inspire and inform others to follow his example, that our world might become a little brighter and better.' In his address, Lord Puttnam described Lord Attenborough as 'gifted, loyal, tenacious, but also deeply sensitive'. He recalled a story from 1990 when Dickie, as he was called by his friends, led a delegation to Downing Street to discuss the creative industries with then prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Lord Puttnam said the PM asked why it had taken them so long to get together, to which he said Lord Attenborough replied: 'Because you never asked me, darling.' Stars have filled Westminster Abbey as a memorial service for actor and Oscar-winning film director Richard Attenborough is held, including his brother David . Sir Michael and Shakira Caine also attended the memorial. Former Chelsea forward Gianfranco Zola also attended.

Sir Michael Caine and Sir John Hurt meet outside the memorial. Inside the Dean of Westminster, the very reverend Dr John Hall, said: 'We come to celebrate the life and achievement of Richard Attenborough, a truly great man: certainly a star of stage and screen, but also a pioneer film-maker, an exemplary leader of his profession, a man of deep commitment, of great generosity of spirit, and of personal warmth.'

After reading the extract, which included the words 'the arts are not a luxury' but 'are for everyone', Sir David added: 'My brother lived by his words.' A host of politicians, Hollywood stars and industry leaders reflected on the life and times of Lord Attenborough after his death last year. Born in Cambridge in 1923, he championed the British film industry through its triumphs and trials, enjoying success as one of Britain's leading actors before becoming a celebrated director and prolific movie-maker. His career highlights included appearing in 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park and clinching eight Oscars for 1982 film Gandhi, including best film and best director. As an actor he was respected enough for top directors Satyajit Ray and Steven Spielberg to lure him out of self-imposed retirement to appear respectively in The Chess Players and Jurassic Park. Spielberg, who chose Lord Attenborough to be 'the perfect ringmaster to bring the dinosaurs back to life' in the films, said he was just one person in a long line of 'Dickie's' fans.

His son Michael was born in 1949, followed by two daughters, Jane and Charlotte. Tragedy struck on Boxing Day 2004 when his elder daughter Jane Holland, and her daughter, Lucy, and her mother-in-law, also named Jane, were killed in the south-Asian tsunami.

Lord Attenborough had been confined to a wheelchair since suffering a stroke six years ago. But his family said he never fully recovered and continued to struggle to communicate and move around. In March last year, he moved into Denville Hall care home because of his failing health. His wife Sheila Sim, 92, who suffers from dementia, had been based at the home since June 2012. It was a specialist charity care home for elderly or sick entertainers in west London. Both Lord and Lady Attenborough helped to found the home and fundraised extensively to help its running.","Film veteran Lord Attenborough, who dominated the British film business for half a century, died last August .

"It is sometimes necessary for men wanting to attract the opposite sex to come out of their shell. Yet it seems that by often choosing the bolder males, women may be missing out on the best possible mate. Researchers have found that the shyest males actually have the most to offer a potential lover - at least in the world of hermit crabs. Hermit crabs, like the ones above, borrow the shells from other creatures to keep them safe and new research has shown that those crabs that stay in their shells more often tend to be a better mate for female crabs . Professor Mark Briffa, a marine animal behaviour researcher at Plymouth University, and his colleagues have found that the most timid crabs tend to more high quality sperm - making them a better option for females looking for a mate. This, they say, is because the crabs that spend more time hiding from the world inside their shells, also have invested the most resources in becoming reproductively fit. Males of a species of hairy chested crab, which has been given a nickname David Hasselhoff, spend their lives largely separate from the females, according to new research. In a study looking at the private life of the deep-sea crab known as the 'Hoff' have found that the males and females spend separate lives at volcanic vents 1.5 miles deep near Antarctica. This, according to the British research, is because of the conflicting demands of feeding and raising young among the sexes. In 2010, a British expedition revealed a 'lost world' of deep-sea animals including the crab named after the Baywatch star thriving on the ocean floor near Antarctica. Using a deep-diving remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to examine the distribution, size and sex of these crabs at the vents, Dr Leigh Marsh and colleagues from the University of Southampton have now pieced together their private lives. The researchers found that large male Hoff crabs live highest on the mineral spires of the deep-sea vents, closest to the hot fluids that jet from them. Smaller males tend to mingle with the females at the base of the mineral spires. It is an unusual approach in the animal kingdom, where the boldest, bravest and strongest usually win the right to mate. Indeed, in many species males have to prove their physical fitness with bold and dramatic displays - like in peacocks and birds of paradise - and even mortal combat in some cases. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Professor Briffa and his colleagues said: 'It appears that in hermit crabs, high-quality individuals that have invested heavily in reproduction, by making large spermatophores, are the most risk averse. 'Although we did not measure metabolic rate, a key process for the pace of life syndrome, this result seems counter to the idea that the most productive individuals should also be the boldest.' The researchers examined the 'personality' of 100 hermit crabs collected from Mount Batten and Hannafore Point in Plymouth. They did this by testing the 'startle response' of each crab by removing it from its tank, inverting the crab for five seconds, which caused it to withdraw into its shell, and then returning it back into the tank upright. The boldest crabs would then poke their heads back out of their shells far faster than the more timid crabs. On average most crabs emerged within 16 seconds. The researchers then measured the levels of a protein called haemocyanin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen around the crabs bodies. They found crabs that stayed in their shells longer after being startled tended to have higher levels of this protein. Hermit crabs, like the one pictured above, hide in their shells when startled, but it also helps them become better mates . This is because when inside their shell, the crabs are unable to access the oxygen rich sea water around them and so higher levels of this protein helps use the oxygen already in their bodies more efficiently. Next the researchers examined the crustacean's gonads and measured the size of the tube shaped bundles of sperm there, called spermatophores. Again they found in the timid crabs, those that were slower to reemerge from their shells after being frightened, had larger spermatophores and so more high quality sperm stored. As they grow, hermit crabs like the one above, 'upgrade' their shells by seeking out larger ones as finding the right home can offer them protection from danger but also give them a way of growing better stores of sperm . Professor Briffa and his colleagues said that hiding in the shell when threatened may allow the crabs to conserve their energy for building up greater sperm reserves. It also reduces the risk of losing a shell in a fight with another crab, something that can increase the amount of stress a crab is exposed to. They said that in hermit crabs less reproductively fit individuals may develop boldness to help them compete with the shier more fertile crabs. They said: 'Low-quality males may emerge more quickly in an attempt to maximize their chance of mating, or because they need to return more quickly to foraging, or through a combination of these causes.'","Biologists at Plymouth University studied how crabs reacted when startled .
They found shyer crabs had larger packets of sperm than the bolder ones .
It contrasts with many species where bold displays tend to attract mates .

"Bali Nine ringleader Myuran Sukumaran has spoken candidly from inside Kerobokan prison of the good he believes he could do if he was ever released from jail. New footage has emerged of Sukumaran, shot as a part of a documentary in May last year, of Sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected. 'I think I can do a lot of good on the outside if I ever got free. It's not like I'm just going to go back after all this and just sit and be somewhere,' reported 9news. 'I would want to do stuff like work and make good stuff and help people,' he told Norwegian educator Ivar Schou, who met the Australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison. New footage has emerged of Sukumaran, shot as a part of a documentary in May last year, of Sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected . Sukumaran, who now faces the death penalty along with fellow inmate Andrew Chan, said that he believed he had done wrong but that he felt his punishment was too harsh. 'I accept what I did was wrong and I think I should be punished for it,' he said. 'But I do think the death penalty is too excessive.' Sukumaran was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years, along with Chan. Sukumaran describes the immense change that he has seen in his life over the past ten years, most notably when he and other inmates were allowed to start education. '(Life’s) changed a lot. The first five years I didn’t do much with my life. It was pretty much spent inside the prison. I pretty much woke up every morning, I did some sport, I ate, I waited (until) lockdown. I woke up the next day and repeated again,' news.com.au reported him as saying. 'Then occasionally I’d have somebody visit me. I pretty much did that for five years,' Sukumaran says. 'In 2009 they finally gave us permission to start working and doing some projects. Slowly slowly it helped me with my life. It kept me busy. It helped me be productive. I started learning and I was able to help other people learning.' Norwegian educator Ivar Schou, who met the Australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison . 'I accept what I did was wrong and I think I should be punished for it,' Sukumaran said . The Australian said that in the past ten years, the only thing that has consistently brought him joy has been helping others, and that being productive was his only real choice in order to avoid being 'destructive'. The release of the very candid interview comes as a painting of the Indonesian President Joko Widodo was revealed, inscribed with the message 'People Can Change'. Sukumaran painted the oil on canvas portrait of Mr Widodo in January after hearing that his bid for clemency was rejected. The Australian has recently completed his Fine Arts degree through Curtin University and has used his art as therapy for himself and other prisoners. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop spoke about the impending execution of Sukumaran and fellow Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan on ABC's Q&A program on Monday night. 'I'm not going to give up hope while they are still alive,' Ms Bishop said. 'I will continue to make representations as we are across Government, at every level across all the Indonesian departments, and the Indonesian ministers, the Australian Government’s counterparts, we will continue to do that, and we are joined by other nations whose citizens are also facing death by firing squad, and we are working very hard, leaving no stone unturned, in our efforts to ensure that we can seek a permanent stay of execution for them' A painting by Sukumaran of the Indonesian President Joko Widodo was revealed . Sukumaran painted the portrait of Mr Widodo after hearing that his bid for clemency was rejected . The original painting was inscribed with the message 'People Can Change' Ms Bishop said that she could find no good purpose that could be served by the execution of the two Australians, especially considering the strides they had made to improving the lives of fellow prisoners. She pointed to the work the pair had been involved in, including the education and encouragement they provided to others in the jail. 'They are involved in the rehabilitation of other prisoners. Andrew Chan is now a Pastor. He has got a theology degree. He is providing a spiritual nourishment to other prisoners,' Ms Bishop said. 'Myuran Sukumaran is now an accomplished artist and he is taking art classes, master classes in art, and I just think that it would be a terrible injustice if these men were to pay for their crimes with their lives.' Ms Bishop echoed Sukumaran's sentiments in his interview, agreeing that the men should not be put to death for their role in the drug smuggling ring. 'Yes, they are paying for their crimes, they are repaying their debt to society, but they shouldn't have to pay with their lives.'

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop spoke about the impending execution of Sukumaran and fellow Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan on ABC's Q&A program on Monday night . 'I'm not going to give up hope while they are still alive,' Ms Bishop said . 'I'm not asking Indonesia to do any more than Indonesia asks other countries. So my appeal, again, is to President Widodo to show mercy, humanity, forgiveness and spare the lives of these two Australians.' The news comes as it was revealed that Chan asked his girlfriend Febyanti Herewila if she would be his wife when she visited him in Kerobokan prison in February. Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death by Indonesian president Joko Widodo. Febyanti and Chan met each other in Kerobokan prison in 2012 after a friend introduced the pair. The Indonesian had been visiting the prison as part of her role as a pastor and Chan was carrying out theological studies in the hope of becoming a minister. Since then they have dreamed of his release, even talking about plans to have children together one day. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph Febyanti claimed she is totally in love with Chan and she did not accept his proposal out of pity for the Bali Nine prisoner. 'I love him for who he is. And I see what he does for other people and that makes me love him more,' Febyanti said. Convicted drug smuggler Andrew Chan proposed to his girlfriend Febyanti Herewila (pictured with ring) of three years when he discovered his clemency bid had been rejected by Indonesian authorities. Febyanti Herewila Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death. 'If you ask me why do I love him, it's because he also has weaknesses as well but he also has a lot of good things about him. I accept him the way he is. I am also very proud of him.' Febyanti and Chan's brother attempted to visit him one last time in Kerobokan prison last Wednesday before his transfer to the Indonesian 'death island' but were denied access. On Monday, Febyanti was one of a selected number of family members who visited Chan on Nusakambangan island. Along with fellow Bali nine prisoner Myuran Sukumaran they hold out desperate hope that a last ditch legal appeal will bring them mercy. The family members were driven in a motorcade from the airport in Cilacap before climbing aboard a small boat, assisted by embassy officials, to visit the Nusakambangan prison island. Michael Chan, the brother of death-row prisoner Andrew Chan, and Chintu Sukumaran, the brother of Myuran Sukumaran spoke to journalists at Wijayapura port. Hopeful that it won’t be the last time they see their loved-ones, Chan's mother Helen and Sukumaran's parents Sam and Raji and his sister Brintha also made the emotional journey. The Age reports Chinthu told reporters: 'My mum, sister and I have been waiting and counting down the days. We have been told he is doing well but we just want to see for ourselves, just make sure to go and see him, to let him know that we love him.' Michael said: 'Mum is fairly excited to see Andy today and it's been a few days, you know. We are looking forward to seeing him when we get over there.'

"With her dark sunglasses and stony expression, the image of Hillary staring at her smartphone made her look such a boss that it launched its own Tumblr parody account. The photograph, which dates from a trip to Tripoli, Libya in September 2011, was even adopted by the former Secretary of State herself for her Twitter profile picture. However, it seems that the picture which inspired hundreds of comedy memes could be no laughing matter for Clinton as it emerges the photograph could be a figurative smoking gun. Indeed, Clinton herself has removed the image removed from her Twitter account because it could show her using her controversial personal email account to conduct diplomacy in Libya. For more than a year, the former Secretary of State had used the monochrome image of her using a Blackberry on board a C-military plane headed to Tripoli in September 2011, around a month after Colonel Gaddafi's regime fell. But the picture, regularly seen by her 2.9million followers, was removed Sunday - ostensibly to promote a political campaign for gender equality, timed to coincide with International Women's Day. The image was once a symbol of Clinton's funny side as the face of the Texts From Hillary meme, which she said had given her 'many LOLZ' - but fell out of favor this week. Switcheroo: Hillary Clinton swapped out a picture of her using a Blackberry on her way to Libya for a silhouette promoting a gender equality initiative . However, the change also comes at a time when senior figures in Congress are intensifying scrutiny of Hillary's communications from 2009-13, which it was recently revealed were not conducted via official State Department accounts. Clinton has handed over swathes of communications from the time, but it has been claimed that the documents have 'huge gaps'. The image was mentioned by the chairman of a House committee into the 2012 attack on U.S. diplomats in Benghazi to suggest that vital communications from Clinton's involvement in Libya were being kept from public view. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-South Carolina), today told CBS's Face the Nation that he has been provided with no emails from the September 2011 trip - despite Clinton being clearly pictures communicating while aboard the plane. Proof? The chairman of the House Committee on Benghazi mentioned that he has seen no emails from Clinton's time in Libya, despite pictures such as this one from 2011, showing her using a Blackberry . He said: 'There are gaps of months and months and months. And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip. 'So, it's strange credibility to believe that if you're on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there's not a single document that has been turned over to Congress. 'So, there are huge gaps. And with respect to the president, it's not up to Secretary Clinton to decide what is a public record and what's not.' Gowdy also said the records don't include anything from around the dates of the Benghazi attack itself, in which the U.S. ambassador to Libya was killed. Suspicions: Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-South Carolina) mentioned the pictured of Clinton while contending that emails from her time in Libya had not been handed over . As of Sunday evening, Clinton's profile still featured the Blackberry image, but as the 'header photo' displayed at the top of the Twitter page. In order to see it, users have to access her profile directly. The image will not appear in the timelines of her followers, nor when she is retweeted or appears in search results. Clinton herself tweeted to explain the change of profile picture. She wrote: 'See my new profile pic to raise awareness on how far we've come in reaching equal rights for women & girls worldwide.' She also included a link to Not-There.org, which is sponsored by the Clinton foundation she runs with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton used to love the photograph now shunted out of her Twitter profile - at least enough to spend time making a meme out of it. After memes imagining her texting politicians and other celebrities took off, she made her own contribution. Diplomatically, unlike many entries on the Texts From Hillary Tumblr site, Hillary's entry does not insult any political rivals, but just ribs the site's creators. From Madam Secretary: Hillary Clinton made this entry into the Texts From Hillary meme herself - but has now replaced the recognizable photo .","Former Secretary of State swapped out phone picture for a blank silhouette .
Said the switch was to raise awareness of gender equality initiative .

"In a genetic first, scientists have sequenced the largest ever set of human genomes from a single population. The epic undertaking involved sequencing the DNA of 2,636 Icelanders and comparing them with the partial sequences of another 104,000. Among several key finds, the data set suggests that the 'father of humanity' - our most recent common male ancestor - lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago. Scroll down for video . In a genetic first, scientists have sequenced the largest ever set of human genomes from a single population. The epic undertaking involved sequencing the DNA of 2,636 Icelanders and comparing them with the partial sequences of another 104,000 revealing insights into human evolution . Scientists see Iceland as a goldmine for doing genetics research. The country was founded by a small group of settlers from Europe arriving about 1,100 years ago and it remained isolated for the next thousand years. Because the population in Iceland has very little genetic diversity, scientists can find genetic variants that raise the chance of disease more easily. Iceland also has strong genealogical record, as a result of well-preserved historical documents. This date range, based on a calculation of human mutation rates, contradicts earlier findings that claim the father of all humans lived around 340,000 years ago. Scientists now estimate his age to be 239,000 years old – a date closer to humanity's most common female ancestor who is believed to have lived 200,000 years ago. As well as evolutionary insights, scientists say the dataset will help them discover 'mutant genes' that naturally protect a rare group of people from certain diseases. So far, the work has provided promising results helping identify 20 million genetic variants among the Icelandic population. Among these variations, scientists at Reykjavik-based DeCode Genetics have already found genes that increase the risks of Alzheimer's disease, liver and thyroid problems. 'This work is a demonstration of the unique power sequencing gives us,' said Kari Stefansson, founder of DeCode, who led the research. 'This is very much more than a molecular national selfie,' he added. 'We're contributing to important tools for making more accurate diagnostics for rare diseases.' Stefansson's team today published four papers online in Nature Genetics, all of which used the Icelandic data. Among several key finds, the data set suggests that the 'father of humanity'  would have lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago. This date range, based on a calculation of human mutation rates (pictured), contradicts earlier findings that claims the father of all humans live around 340,000 years ago . They detail mutations in the ABCA7 gene that are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Six of the eight mutations in ABCA7 were also found to be present in other populations of European ancestry, including the US, indicating that the results are not specific to the Icelandic population. They also identify a variant of the gene ABCB4 that is significantly associated with the risk of developing liver disease. Gilian McVean, a geneticist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study told New York Times that discovering a rare association this way 'is a bit of a holy grail' for geneticists. 'Large scale whole-genome sequencing of the Icelandic population' This study demonstrates how DeCode is able to use national genealogies to infer rare genetic mutations throughout the population. 'Identification of a large set of rare complete human knockouts' The scale and detail of the data was used to identify more than a thousand knocked out genes in the population. The study found nearly eight per cent of the 104,000 people studied having at least one gene that don't work. 'The Y-chromosome point mutation rate in humans' The data set suggests that the 'father of humanity' - our most recent common male ancestor - would have lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago. This date range, based on a calculation of human mutation rates, contradicts earlier findings that claims the father of all humans live around 340,000 years ago . 'Loss-of-function variants in ABCA7 confer risk of Alzheimer's disease' This study details mutations in the ABCA7 gene that are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Six of the eight mutations in ABCA7 were also found to be present in other populations of European ancestry, including the US, indicating that the results are not specific to the Icelandic population. A separate study reveals that 8,000 Icelanders – around 7.7 per cent of the population - have a least one gene of their 21,000 genes that doesn't function at all. The most common genes that were muted were those associated with a person's sense of smell, and overall, the researchers found 1,171 different genes that had been silenced. The scientists now intend to recall those Icelanders with knock-out genes as part of a new study to try to identify any physical differences or diseases that have caused the silenced genes. The work was funded by Amgen, a California-based biotechnology company that paid $415 million for Reykjavik, Iceland-based DeCode two years ago. It is now basing its research projects against DeCode's database to make sure its medications are aimed at the right people. But some experts are wary of the results. They say the Icelandic population has a unusual demographic history because the country is isolated, with only around 320,000 inhabitants. A separate study reveals that 8,000 Icelanders – around 7.7 per cent of the population - have a least one gene of their 21,000 genes that doesn't function at all.  Overall, the researchers found 1,171 different genes that had been silenced . Andrew Allen, a geneticist at Duke University who didn't take part in the studies told The Verge said this means that the 'sample studied is not exactly healthy, is somewhat opportunistic, and probably doesn't correspond to any 'real' population.' But Stefansson says that the results should still be representative of people in other areas because the Icelandic population doesn't meet any of the requirements for interbreeding. The scientists are now trying to decide whether they will provide the study participants with information their genetic risk for various diseases. Stefansson's own view is that 'it would be a crime' not to let them know. Scientists see Iceland as a goldmine for doing genetics research. The country was founded by a small group of settlers from Europe arriving about 1,100 years ago and it remained isolated for the next thousand years. Because the population in Iceland has very little genetic diversity, scientists can find genetic variants that raise the chance of disease more easily. Iceland also has strong genealogical record, as a result of well-preserved historical documents. Stefansson says look at the genetics databases from the top down, rather than from the bottom up, could result in some breakthroughs in medicine. 'I'm 100 percent sure that we will find more protective mutations,' he told Bloomberg news. 'I'm absolutely convinced these protective mutations are going to be important when it comes to pointing us toward good drug targets.'

Scroll down for video . After a 22-month hiatus disgraced celebrity chief Paula Deen returns to cable television on Wednesday with the launch of a new show on obscure shopping channel Evine Live . Evine Live, which changed its named from ShopHQ in November, already offers a range of Paula-branded goods including a set of four chocolate butter sticks for $27.68 and 20 sausages and mustard for $79.07. As well as offering fans the opportunity to buy her various products, Deen and family will be answering questions via Google Hangout. 'Everybody makes mistakes,' said Evine CEO Mark Bozek when asked about hiring the controversial figure in a recent Bloomberg TV interview. He also said that Deen 'has a good soul' and 'a huge fan base.' 'Y'all are going to love the fabulous and flavorful products we have lined up for you to enjoy!' said Deen about her latest venture. In 2012 the celebrity chef was sued by a former employee who claimed the then-beloved Southern chef and her brother had made racist remarks at their Savannah, Georgia restaurant. Among the Paula-branded good that Evine Live is selling is a set of four chocolate butter sticks for $27.68 and 20 sausages and mustard for $79.07 . Paula Deen's Kitchen is described as a three-hour live program where she will cook some of her recipes and offer exclusive food and pantry items for purchase . In a court deposition, she admitted to using the 'N word' and later released a video, in tears, apologizing for the incident. 'I is what I is, and I'm not changing,' she famously told Today show host Matt Lauer. 'If there is anyone out there that has never said something that they wish they could take back, please pick up that stone and throw it so hard that it kills me.' In the aftermath of the scandal Deen was dropped by the Food Network, where she was a host for 13 years. She also lost millions in endorsement contracts and publishing deals when brands including Wal-Mart, Target, Ballantine Books, Caesars Entertainment and Home Depot dropped her. Last year Deen launched the digital Paula Deen Network, but Evine marks her official return to TV. Paula Deen's Kitchen will also air additional live segments once every six-to-eight weeks. 'I is what I is, and I'm not changing': Deen appeared on the Today show in tears in 2013 as her multi-million dollar empire collapsed .","Disgraced celebrity chef returns to television screens on Wednesday with the launch of a new show on obscure shopping channel Evine Live .

"Albert Podell's passport stamp collection probably trumps yours. The former Playboy editor, author and adventurer has travelled to each of the world's 196 countries over a period of fifty years. Podell, now 78, has encountered everything from run ins with guerillas in Yemen to being attacked by flying crabs in Algeria and being interrogated by Cuban secret police. 'Aged six, I started to collect postage stamps, and where the other kids specialised in certain countries, I wanted a stamp from every country in the world. Getting a passport stamps from every one may have been inspired by that,' he tells Mail Online Travel. 'Those little coloured bits of perforated paper also instilled in me a fascination with travel because I wanted to see the lands where all the objects, people, and places depicted on those stamps came from.' The Huli Wigmen of Papua New Guinea spend several years under the supervision of a wig master to grow these huge wigs, says Podell . 'My parents were poor and could not afford to travel, which led me to resolve early on that there was more to life than hanging around in one city forever. The author has been driven by wanderlust ever since: When he was 28 he led an expedition around the world the set the record for the longest direct, non-repetitive automobile journey ever made around the earth. And growing older spurred him on.  'As I moved past middle age, I still wanted to do one grand and glorious travel venture, to go out with a bang rather than a whimper, and, after I realized that I had been to 90 nations, I decided that I just might be able to visit every one of the 196 countries during my allotted years,' he says. His travels have taken him to the furthest flung corners of the globe, allowing him to meet some of the world's most colourful characters: In his book, Around the World in Fifty Years, released this month, he fondly remembers a flamboyant camel driver; a voodoo priest and a deaf and mute Japanese badminton Olympian. Pretty in pink: Two hostesses in traditional Korean dress welcoming Podell to a foreigners-only restaurant in North Korea . A smiling woman wearing yellow in Ghana, left.

In the course of his travels Podell has eaten: . Armadillo - in the hills of Grenada . Zebra - in Kenya . Fish lips, fish eyes, fungus soup, duck's feet, roasted duck gizzard, braised jellyfish, spicy soup of shredded intestines and organ meats boiled in blood,  sea cucumber - in China . Kangaroo, ostrich, emu, and Moreton Bay Bugs - in Australia . Poisonous ugu sushi - in Japan . Possum pie - various Caribbean islands . Guinea pig - in Peru, Bolivia . Crocodile in Africa and Australia . Gnu, antelope, eland, gazelle, springbok, steenbok, klipspringer, kudu, nyala, and oryx - in sub-Saharan Africa . Pigeon  - in France and Morocco . Iguana - in Central America . Blood sausage - in Colombia and Germany . Smashed chicken infused with sugar and covered with ice cream - in Turkey . Snake - various places . Horse - in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan . Pig's blood porridge, caramelized fish hatchlings, lotus root salad, steamed blood cockles, caramelized pork belly and Mekong rat - in Vietnam . Toasted leafcutter ants, oven-baked tarantulas, waxworm potato fritters, bees, beetles, crickets, worms, caterpillars, scorpions, wax moth larvae, and grubs - in many places, and not always intentionally . Podell's adventures have seen him trapped Cape Buffalo and crocodiles in Botswana; unable to furnish the required proof to the Egyptian police that he was not Jewish; being unable to prove to the Cuban secret police that he was not CIA and been thrown in jail in Baghdad when a con artist pretended he had hit him with a land cruiser. He lists the most hair-raising moments as: being stranded on Kiribati, pick pocketed in Tunis and robbed of much equipment in Algiers and the Khyber Pass, nearly lynched in East Pakistan, almost drowned in Costa Rica, detained by the police in Kinshasa and Hargeisa, jailed in Baghdad, attacked by the flying crabs in Algeria, breaking three ribs and ripping flesh and tearing rotator cuffs in many lands. With an accommodation budget of around £7 per night, the writer has unrolled his sleeping bag 'at border posts, roadsides, jungles, glaciers, airport floors, and in hostels,  tents, trailers, trees, teepees, campers, cars, caravansaries, desert dugouts, and flea-bag motels alternately sweating and freezing; dodging dengue- fever mosquitoes by day and malarial ones by night.' 'I preferred to eat from open-air stands where I could see the cooking, and the dishwashing, and how healthy the chef looked. Here Gabon' The children in a North Korean orphanage have been taught to perform a show to entice prospective parents into adopting them . Modes of transport have varied. Podell explains that he's travelled by 'ancient Third World airplanes; leaky, overloaded foreign ferries; broken-down, jam-packed bush taxis driven on rutted roads at 100 mph by wild kids who never passed a driving test; pole-pushed canoes loaded with 40 people and 20 sheep.' He's ridden atop a cotton truck in Uzbekistan, camels, donkeys, horses, elephants, rickshaws, carts, wheelbarrows, and tuk-tks, as well as 'Motorcycles,  catamarans, hydrofoils, dugout canoes and the Queen Mary. In short, almost anything that transports people, except an ambulance, thank God.' And of course, Podell has been privy to some of the world's rarest - and sometimes unappealing - culinary offerings.

'Among the more memorable  was an anteater Steve [his companion] and I found recently run over on a road in Panama. Not wanting to waste a good source of protein, we chopped it up, added salt and pepper, wished we had a box of Roadkill Helper, roasted it over a campfire, and it tasted… awful, like a burger marinated in formic acid,' he says. 'Rats are, in contrast – and after you overcome any squeamish cultural bias - rather tasty, especially the big boys eaten in Africa, where they're called 'grass cutters,' an appealing appellation doubtless bestowed by the branding consultant who renamed the Patagonian toothfish as 'Chilean sea bass' and the slimefish as 'orange roughy.' The locals skin the rodents, split them down the middle, spread them out flat, and roast or grill them. Each tastes exactly like what it ate. If it lived in a cane field, it tastes like sugar. 'Unfortunately, the elephant dung beetle I ate in Kenya smelled exactly like what it ate, but I overcame this olfactory impediment with a liberal application of insect repellant under my nose.' 'And then there was the pulsating brain of that live monkey in Hong Kong...' 'The residences and dwelling places made me wonder if it is fair or necessary to have such wide disparity between the haves and the have-not around the world,' says Podell . Podell met thousands of colourful characters on his travels, including a prostitute in Berlin, left, and a happy Haitian man, right . What did he learn on the road? 'We all read about the economic inequality between the rich and poor nations, and about the great wealth gap between the rich and poor people within nations, but until you actually see people – one third of the world, in fact – trying to manage to live on less than two dollars a day, it does not hit home. 'Unless you are there, it is almost impossible for us to imagine what it is like to have to provide shelter, food, clothing, medical care, and all the other necessities of life on two dollars a day.' 'With the exception of the few truly weird countries (like North Korea and those in the midst of famine or war) people around the world are pretty much the same in terms of their love for their families and children, their desire to be happy, and their hope to live in peace and have a better life. 'The main differences I observed were that people in the very poor countries were far more able to get along on less than citizens of the rich countries ever could.'

"A street performer with no legs or driver's licence has been caught by police driving a van across a Chinese highway. Remarkably, police caught Chen Shikuan driving the modified vehicle after seeing a sign stating it was a 'vehicle for disabled people'. Upon closer inspection, they discovered the double amputee had modified the pedals so they could be hand-controlled and he could drive without having to use his legs. Chen Shikuan (pictured) modified the vehicle so that he could operate it using just his hands . He explained that he lost his legs in an accident two years ago and travelled the country working as a street performer . Police gave him a warning but let him go after telling him not to drive on the highway again . Shikuan was stopped at a toll gate in central China's Hubei Province after suspicious police officers noted the disability message inscribed on the number plates. When questioned, Mr Shikuan explained he was once a lorry driver but lost his legs in an accident two years ago. Deciding he did not want to become a beggar, he made a living as a street artist and travelled the country singing on the streets with his wife. Officers gave him a warning but let him go after telling him not to drive on the highway again. In 2008, a Chinese driver made headlines when he was handed a public safety summons after being caught driving without arms. Zing Shen was steering the vehicle with his feet and claimed he had been driving like that for years after losing his limbs in an industrial accident. At the time, a police spokesman said: 'The man said that he was a very safe driver and felt he was as good as anyone else on the road, despite his disability. 'He had an automatic so did not need to worry about changing gears and said he had put a lot of practice into learning to control the steering wheel with his legs.'

"The homeless woman who was mocked in a Vogue editor's 'cruel' Instagram post that caused a storm around the world today hit back at the fashionista German princess, saying her situation is 'no joke'. Huddling inside her thick winter coat with a blanket over her lap, Maryse Dumas, said: 'It's not nice taking pictures of people living on the street, that not polite', adding: 'It's no joke being destitute, living on the street. 'Look at me surrounded by all this rubbish, it's ugly. It's hard living on the street. It's cold at night and if you can't sleep you get ill. My legs hurt and I'm losing my teeth.' Hurt: Maryse Dumas told MailOnline that the post by the Vogue editor-at-large Elisabeth von Thurn Und Taxis was 'not nice, that not polite' 'Out of touch': The German princess posted this photo on Instagram, with the caption, 'Paris is full of surprises....and @vouguemagazine readers even in unexpected corners!' It caused outrage . Vogue editor-at-large Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis posted a picture of Miss Dumas reading a copy of the fashion magazine on Instagram on Saturday. The princess accompanied the photograph with the caption; 'Paris is full of surprises and @voguemagazine readers even in unexpected corners!' She was almost immediately hit with a barrage of criticism, with Instagram users describing the photo as 'cruel' and 'tasteless'. Surrounded by plastic bags, cardboard boxes and suitcases, the 65-year-old spends her days looking at colourful pictures and drawing, as the rich and famous walk past her on the street in central Paris that is her home. Confused but good-natured, Miss Dumas said she had picked up the fashion magazine as she liked the colours. She told MailOnline: 'I like colours. I liked that Vogue magazine because of the colours. But I don't have it any more. Once I've read something I throw it away. I like colouring as well.' She added: 'I don't remember a young woman taking my picture – let alone a princess.' A long-standing member of Paris' homeless community Miss Dumas has lived on the streets for as long as anyone can remember. Under fire: Many  criticized von Thurn und Taxis for posting the picture. Some claimed the photo was 'cruel' and 'tasteless'. The fashionista was back on the front row on Monday at the Giambattista Valli show (right) Hard life: Miss Dumas said that she has lived on the street for as long as she can remember. She said she has trouble sleeping in the cold, has bad legs and is losing her teeth. Help: A spokeswoman for the homeless charity, Emmaus, told MailOnline: 'Maryse has been living on the streets for a long time. She is bit confused but she is friendly. We do our best for her and we know her well' Hand-outs: She relies on the goodwill of those passing by - and even the homeless give her their belongings . A spokeswoman for the homeless charity, Emmaus, told MailOnline: 'Maryse has been living on the streets for a long time. She is bit confused but she is friendly. We do our best for her and we know her well.' Miss Dumas says she does not know how long she has been on the street. She told MailOnline: 'I have been here for a while, I don't know how long. I found this place one night and I have been ever since'. The old lady has become such a permanent fixture on the road where she beds down that other homeless people leave their belongings with her. Miss Dumas told MailOnline: 'I'm always here. Other people on the street leave their stuff with me to look after. I live in Paris now but I don't know where I grew up. 'I know I'm not married and that I don't have any children but I don't know if my parents are still alive. I'm all alone.' Miss Dumas says she makes ends meet the hand outs she receives from passers-by. She told MailOnline: 'I survive from the donations that I get from people walking by. They are not my friends, just people who walk past and take pity on me. I get help from charities as well, like Emmaus, they look out for me.' Miss Dumas' pitiful existence, is a far cry from the luxurious lifestyle of 32-year-old Princess Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis. Known as TNT – the initials from her surname Thurn und Taxis – is based in London and has been writing as a style editor-at-large for Vogue since 2012. Throwaway fashion: Miss Dumas said: 'I like colours. I liked that Vogue magazine because of the colours. But I don't have it any more. Once I've read something I throw it away' Waiting for an apology: The 65-year-old told MailOnline: 'No one has said sorry to me' Arriving in the French capital on Friday night the princess has enjoyed the splendour of Paris fashion week, while Maryse Dumas has bedded down for the night on the cold pavement outside. Alighting from the first class carriage of the Eurostar train from London von Thurn und Taxis was picked up by a waiting motorbike taxi – to beat the rush hour traffic – to make it to the Dior fashion show. The princess has been styled by top professionals, including celebrity hairdresser David Mallett, who she has thanked for 'turning my Eurostar mess into a look'. She has rubbed shoulders with the great and good at exhibitions given by style houses including fashion designer Simone Rocha, vintage boutique Resee and jeweller Noor Fares. The princess' evening ended with a gala dinner hosted by luxury shoe handbag and accessory designer Charlotte Olympia, who presented each guest with a piece of miniature footwear. Von Thurn und Taxis finally deleted the post mocking Miss Dumas on Sunday – after she was attacked for her bad taste. Style website Fashionista claimed the photo, like von Thurn und Taxis' other content, was 'out of touch'. It wrote: 'The things she writes, both in Vogue and on social media, often straddle the line between entertaining / aspirational and disturbingly out of touch. 'On Saturday she crossed the line.' Initially the princess questioned the criticism, writing; 'Why cruel? The person to me is as dignified as anyone!' But on Sunday she wrote; 'I want to extend my sincerest apologies for the offense [sic] my post has caused. Yours truly Elisabeth.' However by lunchtime on Monday, Miss Dumas has not received an apology from the princess, who was back at Paris Fashion Week at the Giambattista Valli show. Glamour: Von Thurn und Taxis was in Paris for Fashion week when she posted the photo. On the left she can be seen at the Christian Dior show with Noor Fares and Olympia Scarry. On the right she is pictured at the Christian Dior - Party At les Bains Douches on Thursday. The 65-year-old homeless lady told MailOnline: 'No one has said sorry to me.' Born at the family's ancestral home, the Thurn und Taxis Castle, a 8th century, 500-room abbey in Regensburg, Germany, in March 1982, Elisabeth is the second child of Johannes, 11th Princes of Thurn und Taxis and his Countess wife, Gloria von Schoenburg-Glauchau. Her brother, Albert, 31, who succeeded their father in 1990 as Albert II, Prince of Thurn und Taxis, has a net worth of more than £1 billion and races in a German auto-racing league. The princess was educated at Sevenoaks in Kent and has a bachelor's degree from the American University in Paris. The von Thurn und Taxis family wealth originated from their postal system empire which can be traced back to around 1290 when two early ancestors operated courier services in the Italian city-states. But the family's important postal activities began with Franz von Taxis, who served as postmaster to the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian I from 1489 and to Philip I of Spain from 1504. The Prussian empire originally bought out the Thurn and Taxis monopoly in 1867 and used it as the basis for a new German national post. A member of the family is believed to have invented the taximeter, which is why taxicabs came to bear his name. The House of Thurn and Taxis held the rank of royalty in the German Empire until 1918.","Maryse Dumas, 65, told MailOnline that Instagram photo of her reading Vogue was 'not nice, not polite'

"Having to find a suitable place in which to land and refuel your F-16 fighter jet can take a lot of time. But this video released by Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska shows the ingenious way to top up the tank without losing any air miles. Captured on camera is the moment the F-16 skilfully flies up behind a tanker aircraft and steadies itself in the skies over snowy Alaska. The F-16 fighter jet skilfully flies up behind the main aircraft and steadies itself while getting into position . A large nozzle extends from the back of the tanker plane and then manoeuvres towards the fighter jet. The jet moves into position, allowing the nozzle to enter a small triangular hole at the top of the F-16. The two planes maintain their speed as the snowy Alaskan landscape flashes by below them, and the fuel transfers from one to the other. Receiving enough fuel to carry on its flight, the fighter jet pulls away from the larger plane and flies off. The large nozzle hanging from the bottom of the plane manoeuvres towards the fighter jet and it latches on . The process is then repeated with another plane moments later. Eielson Air Force Base and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson are the home of RED FLAG-Alaska, who execute tactical air combat employment exercises. The exercises are designed to help pilots gain more experience by having them deal with the stresses war fighters go through while flying, but in controlled conditions. The two planes maintain their speed while flying over Alaska as fuel is transferred from one to the other . After receiving enough fuel to carry on its flight, the fighter jet pulls away from the larger aircraft . The crews are subjected to a number of conceivable combat threats, and up to 70 jet fighters can be operating in the same airspace at one time. On average, however, more than 1,000 US Air Force members and up to 60 aircraft deploy to Eielson, and an additional 500 people and 40 aircraft deploy to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for each event. The exercises also provide an operations training environment for participants such as unit-level intelligence experts, maintenance crews, and command and control elements. Refuelling in the air is an example of a tactical exercise pilots are required to demonstrate.","Astonishing video shows an F-16 jet steadying itself behind a tanker plane .

"As death-defying stunts go, hurling yourself off a 60-foot high platform on the back of the horse into just 12 feet of water must surely be up there with one of the most insane. But back in 1920s Atlantic City, launching a horse off a platform almost twice the height of a 10 metre Olympic diving board was a daily occurrence. What's more, the ability to do it well could win you fame. Scroll down for video . Unbelievable: The horses plummeted off 40 or 60 foot high platforms into 12 feet of water . Death-defying: The stunt had gained popularity in the state circuses which traveled America . Star attraction: But it was when it arrived in Atlantic City in the late 1920s that the stunt really took off . The amazing act was just one of the shows on offer at Atlantic City's Steel Pier, which opened in 1898 and was once America's most famous amusement attraction. Diving horse arrived on the pier in the 1920s, having become a fixture of travelling circuses previously. It would go on to become the star attraction at Steel Pier, with crowds gathering to marvel at the dangerous feat as the horse flew off the end of 40 and 60 foot platforms. Annette French, who dove horses from 1928 until 1935, throwing herself off the platform two to six times a day, told the New York Times in 2008: 'We were the stars of the Boardwalk. 'Everybody had to see the diving horse. That was what everybody remembered. 'We were a class act.' Glamorous: The rider would don a swimming costume before jumping the horse off the platform . Safe: Those who dove horses maintain it was safe - with only a few broken bones a year . Well-kept: Horse diver Annette French said the animals 'lived the life of Riley' and it was not cruel . Mrs French's sister Sonora Webster Carver was arguably the best-known of the horse divers, whose story was immortalized in the 1991 Disney film Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken. She took her first dive aged just 15, in 1923, and became one of the best in the business. But in 1931, her career could have come to a premature end, when she was blinded after a knock to the head which detached her retinas. Ms Carver was not about to stop, however: she dove horses for another 11 years, while unable to see. Fame: The best-known horse diver was Sonora Webster Carver, who had a Disney film made about her life . History: Amazingly, you could still see horse diving as recently as 1978 . The trick to surviving the falls, according to those in the know, was to tuck your head down one side as the horse plunged towards the water below. It is claimed the riders only suffered a few broken bones each year, while Mrs French told the New York Times the horses were so well looked after they 'lived the life of Riley'. However, despite animal protection officers were concerned about the act, it continued until 1978 - when the pier had fallen into such a state of disrepair it had to be shut.","Horse diving developed in America in the early part of the 20th century .

"Peacock tails may be hard to miss, but humans are unaware of the noise created by the bird's pretty plumage. Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate. Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails when displaying (stock image) to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate across dusty scrub land, the study claims . Researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them. Most humans hear noises between 20 and 20,000 hertz. Dr James Hare noticed a peacock displaying and shaking its tail at a wall in a zoo, which he noted looked like a satellite dish and made him question whether the bird was listening to itself, BBC Earth reported. This sparked a study, leading him and graduate student Angela Freeman to record the sound of 46 peacocks shaking their feathers while displaying. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males (stock image) shrieking out . Charles Darwin first suggested that a peacock’s train serves to attract females and studies have since shown that females tend to prefer males with the most exaggerated male characteristics. Amotz Zahavi said the train indicates a male’s fitness. Males with impressive trains have been shown to be healthier, suggesting that the ornament indicates a male’s ability to survive. His ‘handicap principle’ says that since males with particularly brightly coloured or large plumes will attract the attention of predators, they must be extra fit to survive. Females are thought to choose mates with good genes, so males with more exaggerated sexual characteristics, such as a big train, tend to have better genes in a peahen’s eyes. Marion Petrie tested whether the displays signal a male’s generic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in England. She found the number of eyespots in the train predicted a male's mating success and that she could manipulate a male’s chances of mating success by cutting off some of his eyespot tail feathers. In the experiment, females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to untrimmed ones. Furthermore, chicks fathered by males with impressive trains weighed more than those sired by less ornamented birds. Humans hear a rustling sound when this happens, but the experts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels, according to the study published in the journal Animal Behaviour. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males shrieking out in response. Experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound, but know that some can feel vibration through their legs. Ms Freeman said that the birds may simply hear the noises through their ears, the inner part of which seems to be the right shape to detect very low noises. Other animals, such as elephants, have long been known to produce such infrasound, which humans can’t hear. And although a type of grouse called the capercaillie produces infrasound, it seemingly doesn't use it to communicate, meaning that the bird either can’t hear it itself or they just doesn't care about it. Ms Freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals. But the noises could also be a way of attracting a mate. She observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers, producing two displays which she called the ‘shiver train’ and the ‘pulse train’. The shiver train is produced by vibration of the train feathers from the centre feathers to the outside of the array and is used by males when females are far away. Ms Freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals. But the noises could also be a way of attracting a mate. Here, a male displays for a brown, female peahen, hoping she will be impressed by his show of strength . The pulse train is produced by a vibration emanating from the base of all the train feathers and it is used when the female is nearby. Peacocks’ tails are a sign of strength and good genes, so a strong noise may reinforce a message of virility, Ms Freeman said. This could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland, where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes can’t see each other. ‘We think that possibly these signals could signal to females and males who are out of sight behind a bush or over the hill,’ she added.","Researchers at the University of Manitoba, Canada, have shown that peacocks make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails .

Male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory .
They could also use the noise to attract a mate across scrubby woodland ."
"The son of a Sydney nightclub owner who raped a teen in a Kings Cross alleyway and then bragged about taking her virginity has been jailed for at least three years. Luke Andrew Lazarus, 23, said he once had 'the world at his feet' and could have been a CEO. Friends from the Sydney private school scene have described their shock at how a 'nice nerd' could end up convicted of rape. He wore braces, was 'shy' around girls, and 'geeky'. Scroll down for video . The son of a Sydney nightclub owner who raped a teen in a Kings Cross alleyway and then bragged about taking her virginity has been jailed for at least three years . Luke Andrew Lazarus said he once had 'the world at his feet' and could have been a CEO . School friends from have described their shock at how a 'nice nerd' could end up convicted of rape . The 23-year-old sat in the dock and stared after the sentence was handed down while his mother moaned in the gallery . On Friday he was told he would be jailed for sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman at the back of his father's Kings Cross club Soho in May 2013. At the elite Cranbrook School, in Bellevue Hill, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, far from being in the 'cool' group, he spent his time with the theatre crowd, and he played one of the Von Trapp children in the school's production of Sound of Music. So rather than hitting the exclusive parties around his home in Vaucluse, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, he spent his weekends in his last year of school practicing his singing, dancing and acting. 'He was particularly shy around girls and completely harmless,' one female who knew him at school said. 'I was told he had a crush on me by one of his friends which struck me as being very primary school - I mean, he was 17 but was far too shy to ever come up and say so himself. 'He was the kind of guy you felt really safe about having as a friend. It's pretty impossible to reconcile the guy I remember with the guy implicated in this crime. I feel so sorry for the victim.' Lazarus attended the exclusive Cranbrook School in Sydney's eastern suburbs . When the girl entered the club Soho (pictured), Lazarus walked up to her, told her he was a part owner in the venue and showed her a business card . On Friday he was told he would be jailed for sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman at the back of his father's Kings Cross club Soho in May 2013 . In sentencing him, Judge Sarah Huggett found the offence was not premeditated but said he was reckless . On the night the teen was assaulted at Soho (pictured), the court heard it was the first time she had gone to Sydney's Kings Cross . Lazarus sat in the dock and stared after the sentence was handed down while his mother moaned in the gallery. Lazarus sat with his hands in the prayer position, his eyes closed, while his mother gasped and was comforted in the arms of her husband and other son. One friend yelled 'are you f------ serious?!' In sentencing him, Judge Sarah Huggett found the offence was not premeditated but said he was reckless. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he must have realised there was a possibility she wasn't consenting,' she told Sydney's District Court. But she said he was 'not caring in one way or another whether she was consenting'. On the night the teen was assaulted, the court heard it was the first time she had gone to Sydney's Kings Cross. After entering the club Soho, Lazarus walked up to her, told her he was a part owner in the venue and showed her a business card. He then asked if she would like to enter a VIP area before taking her into an alleyway out back. They kissed but when she said she wanted to go back to her friends he said: 'No, stay'. He pulled her stockings down, ignored a second request by her to leave and said in an authoritative tone 'put your f***ing hands on the wall, get on the floor and arch your back'. Scared, she complied. During the assault that followed, the teen told him she was a virgin. The parents of Luke Lazarus leave Sydney's District Court on Thursday. Their son will be eligible for release in March 2018 . Lazarus sat in the dock and stared after the sentence was handed down while his mother (left) moaned in the gallery . When it was over Lazarus told her to add her name to a list of conquests that he had. He later texted a friend 'sick night, took a chick's virginity LOL so tight'. 'It was her right to kiss the accused and it was her right to say she wanted to return to her friend,' Judge Huggett said. 'The offender ignored that.' Judge Huggett said Lazarus came from a privileged upbringing and had an inflated sense of entitlement and power when he was at the Soho. But she found he had good prospects of rehabilitation, was unlikely to reoffend and was suffering from an adjustment disorder due to a break-up in the weeks prior to the offence. She sentenced him to a maximum of five years in jail. He will be eligible for release in March 2018.","Luke  Lazarus has been jailed for at least three years for raping a teen in Kings Cross in 2013 .

"Face-off: Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has met Philip Hammond . Kenya is threatening to tear up a 40-year military co-operation deal with the UK amid claims that British soldiers – who have allegedly committed serious crimes in the country – are escaping justice. The British Army could lose some of its best training facilities worldwide if it does not agree that any soldier accused of crimes should be dealt with under Kenyan law, rather than returned to the UK. British soldiers have been accused of crimes while serving in Kenya, but none have been prosecuted, despite allegations of serious assault and affray, alleged rape and murder, and protests by dozens of women that they were abandoned by soldiers who fathered children with them. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has now made the ultimatum to Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond during tense diplomatic negotiations over a long-standing deal which has allowed up to 10,000 British troops a year to carry out exercises in Kenya’s harsh terrain before deploying to active operations in theatres such as Afghanistan and Iraq. A recent session between Mr Hammond and Mr Kenyatta ended without agreement. Yesterday a renewal contract remained unsigned as both sides went public with their grievances. Brigadier Duncan Francis, defence adviser to the British High Commission in Nairobi, claimed British soldiers had always been accountable for any crimes committed in Kenya ‘under Kenyan or UK law’, and pointed out that Britain was Kenya’s ‘most steadfast ally on defence and security matters’. But presidential adviser Manoah Esipisu said the country’s new constitution required that British soldiers accused of offences in Kenya must be prosecuted under Kenyan law. ‘These are tough negotiations and there will be no backing down by Kenya on this issue,’ he said. ‘Kenya is not the same country as when these agreements were signed.’ The current deal is worth an estimated £58million a year to the Kenyan economy, and also involves British troops training the Kenyan Armed Forces in reciprocation. But that could come to an end if deep-riven problems cannot be solved. Kenyan security expert Professor Trevor Ng’ulia said relations between the two countries were so bad that it was a matter of ‘who blinks first’ in the current face-off before the deadline of April 21. Exercises: Thousands of British troops train in Kenya. Pictured: soldiers use camels to reach remote areas . He said relations had soured since 2013 when British High Commissioner Christian Turner warned in the run-up to Kenyan elections that the UK would not be prepared to meet Mr Kenyatta if he was elected, ‘except for essential business’ as he had been indicted by the International Criminal Court and was due to stand trial for his alleged involvement in post-election violence and killings in 2007. The charges were finally withdrawn this month. This was exacerbated by continual Foreign Office travel advisories warning tourists that Kenya was not safe from terrorism. President Kenyatta is believed to have retaliated by refusing permits for a battalion from the Parachute Regiment due to replace 700 infantrymen who were then stranded in Nairobi for several days as a result. One month later Britain sent five senior Kenyan army officers home in a suspected tit-for-tat. A UK Government spokesman said: ‘Negotiations on a new Defence Co-operation Agreement are ongoing. We are working together to achieve a swift outcome.’ An MoD source said the Government hoped a new deal would be signed ‘within days’.","Kenya is threatening to tear up 40-year military co-operation deal with UK .

"An 18-year-old man has been arrested at his home in Birmingham on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State. West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham, was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. A spokesman for the force said: 'The operation was pre-planned and intelligence led. There was no immediate threat to public safety.' An 18-year-old man has been arrested at his home in Birmingham on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State (stock picture) West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham (stock picture), was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit . The man was arrested at his home address on suspicion of preparing for terrorist acts, contrary to Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006. It comes the day after it three British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State fighters in Syria, in a dramatic security operation. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Istanbul after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned at a high-security London police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Last night they were released on bail. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'They have been bailed to return to a central London police station pending further inquiries.' Investigators hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so. Brent Council has confirmed that all three teenagers who have been bailed until a date in early May are from the north west London borough. It comes the day after it was revealed that three British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey, after a dramatic security operation stopped them joining Islamic State fighters in Syria . Council leader Muhammed Butt welcomed the quick actions of their families, saying that their decision to call authorities was 'vital' in getting the youngsters home safely. He said: 'It is good to know that these young men are now safely home with their families. This is because the families involved decided to call the authorities as soon as they realised their children were missing. 'This quick action was vital as it meant the police and border authorities were able to work effectively together to bring them home safe and sound. 'I would like to thank the Met Police and Turkish authorities for their swift action in returning the boys back to the UK in less than 48 hours.' He added that it was important for everyone in the community to work together to ensure people in danger of making the wrong choice get the guidance and support they need. Speaking in the Commons, Security Minister James Brokenshire said he could not comment on the specifics of the recent arrests but told MPs: 'It has been reported three young men were arrested at the weekend after attempting to travel from Turkey to Syria. 'This reflects the good working relationship we have with the Turkish authorities. 'MPs will understand I cannot comment on the specifics because there is an on-going investigation but I will say those seeking to travel to engage in terrorist activity in Syria or Iraq should be in no doubt we will take the strongest possible action to protect our national security, including prosecuting those who break the law.' MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the latest arrests suggest the flow of young people intending to travel to Syria is 'on a much larger scale than we envisaged'. 'I welcome the action that has been taken by the Turkish authorities,' he said. After meeting the boys' families, Mr Vaz said: 'The families of the two of the young men that I met are honourable, decent, hard-working British citizens who knew absolutely nothing about their sons' decisions. They acted swiftly, with the support of the leader of the council, to alert the police. 'The police need to be commended for the speed with which they dealt with this case. I have spoken to the Turkish ambassador to congratulate him on the action taken by the Turkish authorities. 'This is a rare good news story in the fight against terrorism and is a lesson to us all that we need to be vigilant against those who seek to groom our young men and women in this way.' It comes just weeks after an international police hunt was launched to find three London schoolgirls who travelled to Istanbul on their journey to Syria . Last week Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the three schoolgirls who fled to Syria from East London would not face prosecution if they came home. This is despite the fact they successfully reached IS and at least two of them are known to have communicated with wanted terrorists. The families of Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, have criticised police and others for failing to stop them. But questions have been raised about why the families themselves did not spot their conversion to radical Islam. The families of the three girls yesterday released a statement appealing for them to come home immediately. Saying they felt their loss 'more acutely' on Mother's Day, the families also criticised authorities, saying: 'With respect to the disappearance of our children we have been disappointed by the handling of this matter by the school, Met Police and the local authority, all of whom we feel failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information to us or indeed between each other.' On Saturday the Daily Mail revealed the identity of another girl, a close friend of the trio, who left Britain before them in December. Sharmeena Begum, 15, disappeared from Bethnal Green Academy and flew to Istanbul from Gatwick. Those closest to all four girls suspect they were groomed by Islamists using social networking sites and secretive internet messaging software. There are also suspicions the trio kept in touch with Sharmeena who passed on information about how to follow in her footsteps. The schoolgirls are understood to be in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa. The authorities in Turkey said the quick deportation of the latest travellers showed how their efforts to combat the flood of extremists is working. One source said: 'The Turkish are willing to act quickly and arrest people but they do not see this as their problem. That is why the suspects were sent back to the UK so quickly. No one here wants to deal with them any longer than they have to.'

"An Indian village in the popular Indian tourist destination of Goa has clamped down on couples kissing in public, claiming the sight of such 'obscene' behaviour offends locals. Salvador de Mundo, a beautiful fishing village in the western coastal state, imposed a ban on public displays of affection after a unanimously passed a resolution by the village parliament. The village, eight miles north of Goa's capital Panaji, has put up signs warning holidaymakers against engaging in PDAs with the council saying they were forced into the action by a lack of a response from local authorities. The resolution also 'banned public drinking and playing loud music.' The village parliament in Salvador de Mundo in Goa, India, have imposed a ban on public displays of affection . India as a country outlaws kissing in public - here activists from a right-wing Hindu organisation, Hindu Sena, prepare to burn placards promoting Valentine's Day during a protest in New Delhi . 'We have adopted this resolution following complaints from villagers about couples kissing in public. This was the only way to put an end to it,' deputy village chief Reena Fernandes told AFP. She however declined to comment on whether punitive action will be taken against potential violators of the bylaws. 'We have serene beaches which attract tourists in a big way. Several times we saw couples acting indecently which irked us,' villager Savio Rebeiro told AFP. Goa's beaches have long been a haven for millions of tourists drawn mostly from the West, but a string of controversial statements by local politicians has dented its tourist-friendly image. The state is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which this week barred its female employees from wearing jeans and sleeveless tops in the office. A married couple pose on a beach in Goa, the state in which locals have complained about kissing in public . India as a whole prohibits obscene acts in public. And although its law don't define 'obscene' in great detail, it definitely includes PDAs. Kissing in public, if enforced, can lead to fines or even imprisonment for up to three months. With Salvador de Mundo clamping down on kissing in the streets, here are some other places where visitors should refrain from kissing, or even holding hands in some cases, in public. The UAE is the most relaxed of the Gulf Arab nations but kissing in public is still forbidden and can result in deportation, fines or jail . UNITED ARAB EMIRATES . Even though Dubai is the most relaxed of the Gulf Arab countries, kissing in public is still strictly illegal and could see offenders deported or jailed. Ahead of last year's festive season the UAE's British embassy released a take on the 'Twas the Night Before Christmas poem to raise awareness of what is and isn't acceptable in public there. “No holding of hands or Christmas kisses; under the mistletoe, despite amorous wishes,” it said. Holding hands in public is also frowned upon and public intoxication is very much a no-no. Sex on the beach, the act rather than the cocktail, will definitely get you put in jail. CHINA . While larger cities with high Western populations may be more tolerant than other areas, couples holding hands or kissing in public goes against the primary values of Buddhism or Confucianism observed in the country. There has even previously been a three foot rule for separation between members of the opposite sex - an extreme version of the balloon between teens at a school dance - but PDAs are still more or less off limits. For some, kissing is considered among most intimate of acts meant only for behind closed doors. INDONESIA . The highly controversial 'Bill on Pornography' prohibits by law those engaging in pornography and pornoaction - a word invented to mean indecent acts. This also includes public displays of affection including kissing. The law aside, kissing in public deeply offends some locals, especially the older generation, in the most populous Muslim country in the world. Couples caught kissing too vigorously in public can be prosecuted and spend up to five years in jail. In saying this, Balinese Hindus recently celebrated their annual Nyepi Day of Silence in which thousands of locals gather in the streets to take part in a kissing ritual known as omed omedan that is supposed to bring fortune for the coming year. A couple hold hands in Tokyo as they walk past a display for White Day, the equivalent of Valentine's Day . JAPAN . While not forbidden by law, kissing in public just isn't done in Japan. A bow to a friend or family member is far more appropriate than a kiss on the cheek and in general terms kissing passionately is reserved for behind closed doors. Being a nation renowned for being incredibly polite, it only makes sense to be the same back. EGYPT . As a predominantly Muslim country, Egypt too frown on kissing in public and even holding hands by the opposite sex isn't appreciated. Indecency laws can be used by police, should they choose to, for overzealous displays of affection and the drinking of alcohol on the streets.","The village parliament in Salvador de Mundo, Goa, banned public kissing .

"A review into sexual abuse inside Australia's Nauru detention centre has found evidence of rape, sexual assault and guards trading marijuana for sexual favours from female detainees. The independent review by former integrity commissioner Philip Moss was released on Friday and has uncovered several dozen cases with guards possibly trading drugs for 'sexual favours' on the Pacific island nation. The 86-page report detailed allegations of indecent and physical assault, as well as sexual harassment, at the offshore processing centre. Scroll down for video . A review into sexual abuse inside Australia's Nauru detention centre (pictured) has found evidence of rape, sexual assault and guards trading marijuana for sexual favours from female detainees . The report states that one detainee, who was a mother of two, had asked for a longer shower to which a 'male security guard' agreed, under the condition that the could 'watch a girl or a boy having a shower.' Detainees had previously complained that two minute showers were not long enough and had requested four minute showers instead. However when one woman asked if she could turn the water back on to wash shampoo out of her eyes, it's alleged in the review that a male guard said he would give her more time, if she showed him her naked body. The review also states that they have been made aware of two specific allegations of rape at the centre . The independent review by former integrity commissioner Philip Moss was released on Friday and has uncovered several dozen cases with guards possibly trading drugs for 'sexual favours' on the Pacific island nation . One rape happened in a woman's tent. She subsequently asked for the incident to be kept quiet for fear of retaliation from other detainees.  She then changed her mind and asked for police to investigate. The report states that the Nauruan Government then granted refugee status to the alleged perpetrator and he is now settled in the Nuaruan community. The second female detainee reported that she had been raped by a 'contract service provider staff member'. She also did not report the incident due to cultural and religious reasons. In another instance, a female detainee told the review that a guard had allegedly offered to give her friend chewing gum and a lollipop if she allowed him to see her naked. The 86-page report detailed allegations of indecent and physical assault, as well as sexual harassment, at the offshore processing centre . On another occasion two female detainees recounted a time when a driver and his assistant turned the vehicle's headlights off and propositioned the women with an offer of cigarettes and chewing gum. One transferee told the review that women in the camp could offer sexual favours in return for marijuana. 'Because they (the transferees) are suffering great depression here, and they feel relieved when they smoke the marijuana, the officers have made them addicted for their own reasons,' the detainee said. 'Because the women do not get paid here, so what they need to obtain,they only have to offer sexual - fulfil the requests of the men.' Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says the content of a review into allegations of abuse against asylum seekers on Nauru is 'very concerning . Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says the content of a review into allegations of abuse against asylum seekers on Nauru is 'very concerning'. Mr Cormann would not be drawn on whether more media access should be allowed on the island in the wake of the report, but said he was concerned by its findings. 'Some of the content in the report ... is very concerning,' he told Sky News on Saturday. 'The department has accepted all of the recommendations and all of the recommendations will be implemented. Mr Cormann would not be drawn on whether more media access should be allowed on the island in the wake of the report, but said he was concerned by its findings . 'Beyond that I'll leave it to the Minister for Immigration to respond to these sorts of inquiries.' The review was ordered by former immigration minister Scott Morrison following claims children had been abused while in detention. The department says it has accepted 19 recommendations from the review and has begun work on implementing them in cooperation with the Nauru government, service providers and the Australian Federal Police. However, Labor have criticised the Federal Government over its initial response to the report after Tony Abbott said these institutions 'aren't perfect.' The ABC have reported that when Mr Abbott was asked about his response to the report he nonchalantly responded saying that 'occasionally, I dare say, things happen.' Labor's Immigration spokesperson Richard Marles called the Federal Government's response a 'disgrace' and believes Mr Abbott needs to take responsibility and think before he speaks. Labor had changed it's tune by the afternoon with Mr Abbott assuring that the Government were assuming the 19 recommendations outlined in the review, calling the findings 'very disturbing.'","A new report has found evidence of abuse at Nauru detention centre .

"Rap music and Muslim women... they are not four words that usually come together. But two women from London are breaking down the boundaries for Islamic females across the world with their brand of inspirational hip hop. Together, Muneera Williams, 34, and Sukina Owen-Douglas, 33, form Poetic Pilgrimage - a self-described 'hiphop hijabis' duo that has created a new type of rap music for the masses that addresses religion, gender and issues of identity. Scroll down for video . Muneera Williams, 34, (left) and Sukina Owen-Douglas, 33, (right) form the hip hop group Poetic Pilgrimage . The women, who were both born and raised in Bristol to Jamaican migrant parents first entered the hip hop world after they moved to the capital together to study at the University Of London a decade ago. Since then, they have cultivated a global fan base of devoted followers from both inside and outside the Islamic community. The attraction for their followers is, in part, the unlikely partnership between the fact that they are Muslim women who have an impressive ability to write and perform verse. Sukina and Muneera converted to Islam ten years ago, just three weeks before the 7/7 bombings, and while the path hasn't always been easy, they haven't looked back. They met at school in Bristol and first became friends while performing in a gospel choir, but only decided to form a group after moving to the capital to study at university. A few years later, they decided to convert to Islam after learning about the religion through the Autobiography of Malcolm X and academic books about Islam and Feminism. Muneera  and Sukina formed their rap group ten years ago . Like most other female Muslims, they now pray five times a day, avoid alcohol and wear the hijab. The marriage of their religion and their profession has both inspired and upset many people though. Sukina told FEMAIL: 'There are people who have messaged us from all over the world who are appreciative of the bravery in our character. 'But on the flip-side there are people who have been unappreciative from both the Muslim community and the non-Muslim community. 'People who have suggested were using our hijabs as a gimmick to make money and that we aren't Muslim at all. 'Then there are people who are really derogatory. In the opening lines of the Al Jazeera documentary we did recently, I rapped about being taken from Africa as a slave to the Caribbean in the opening scene. 'I got comments like ""You should be grateful that we colonised you, otherwise Africans would still be in mud huts."" 'It's the nature of our technological society though, you get a lot of trolling.' The duo's lyrics are based around feminism, Islam and political issues . To say that the woman have cornered a niche in the market is an understatement - their lyrics are based around feminism, Islam and political issues. Sukina said: 'We talk about political situations but we try and take a different stance. 'For instance, with something like the Palestine issue we talk about someone who has lost a husband or someone who is a mother. 'So we talk about it from a female perspective.' At first, the women had a difficult time convincing the Muslim community that they should be onstage rapping. But in the last ten years, they have turned the prejudice around. Sukina said: 'In the Muslim community it was very difficult because the topic of hip hop is very flammable. It's everything that can be wrong with the world  - drugs, violence and everything. 'Parts of the Muslim community do find it very difficult. 'People have approached my husband and asked ""why do you allow your wife to do this? Why do you allow your wife onstage? I would never let my wife go onstage, I would never let my wife travel without me."" 'He's a rapper as well, he's in a band called Native Sun and he has always known me as a rapper, so for us there has never been even a consideration that this shouldn't happen. 'But that is hard for people to understand. 'But in the last few years people have come to understand that it is a very positive thing and we have been asked to speak on panels at conferences on Islam.' The pair have released an album called The Starwomen . While there may have been problems with the way the women have been received, the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive overall. One of the biggest surprises for the women was how wide their fan base was when they started. Sukina said: 'When we first converted to Islam we though tour main following would be young Muslim girls from England. 'But at that time it was the beginning of Myspace - it was  the first independent platform to put your music online - and some comments we got from people blew our minds. 'We had amazing comments from people like a middle aged white guy from Austria or a couple from Portugal. 'It wasn't just people from the Muslim community. 'It is hard to put it into a box, we represent the voice of women, the voice of black people and the voice of people from Islam.' And with a huge surge in interest into their music over the last few months, their popularity is only going to grow. Sukina said: 'Some of the reaction we've had from people is amazing  - we can't get our heads around the attention we've got. 'Ours is not a story of sorrow, we are not women wounded, rather we have found strength in what may seem strange to overs and we wouldn't have it any other way.'","Muneera Williams and Sukina Owen-Douglas are female Muslim rappers .

"A father was found slumped over his steering wheel unconscious after overdosing on heroin while driving his two young children and wife on a highway. Larry Messer, 39, of Harrison, Ohio admitted to injecting himself with heroin before driving onto Interstate 74 on Saturday with his two kids, aged seven months and two, who were seated in the back seat. After he passed out, his wife, who has not been named, had to grab the steering wheel bringing the car to a stop on the side of the road, according to court documents. During an inventory search of the car, police found  numerous meth pipes, a spoon, hypodermic needles and a loaded syringe filled with heroin as identified by Messer, according to WCPO.

"The Australian government has rallied behind a plan to protect the Great Barrier Reef from future degradation, releasing a long-term plan to prevent the World Heritage Site from being declared 'in danger'. The World Heritage Committee is to decide whether the Reef is on the 'in danger' list in June, and in a bid to ensure the long-term health of the national treasure, the Federal and Queensland governments released The Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan. The Reef, which covers an area of 348,000 square metres, is the world’s most extensive coral reef ecosystem, and is listed by UNESCO 'a site of remarkable variety and beauty'. Scroll down for video . The Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan was announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Saturday . Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed the plan on Hamilton Island in far north Queensland on Saturday, and said that Australia is 'utterly committed as an entire nation to the protection of the Great Barrier Reef which is one of the natural wonders of the world', reported The ABC. 'The Great Barrier Reef is an incredibly diverse and rich environment – a maze of 3000 coral reefs and 1050 islands stretching for over 2300 kilometres,' said a press release from Mr Abbott. 'It is already regarded as being among the best managed marine parks in the world. We’re determined to keep it that way.' The Reef includes 2,500 individual reefs and over 900 islands, as well as over 1,500 species of fish, about 400 species of coral, 4,000 species of mollusk, and 240 species of birds. 'Collectively these landscapes and seascapes provide some of the most spectacular maritime scenery in the world,' says the Reef's listing by UNESCO. 'This diversity, especially the endemic species, means the GBR is of enormous scientific and intrinsic importance, and it also contains a significant number of threatened species.' Mr Abbott said that Australia is 'utterly committed as an entire nation to the protection of the Great Barrier Reef which is one of the natural wonders of the world' 'The Great Barrier Reef is an incredibly diverse and rich environment – a maze of 3000 coral reefs and 1050 islands stretching for over 2300 kilometres,' said a press release from Mr Abbott . The Reef includes 2,500 individual reefs and over 900 islands, as well as over 1,500 species of fish . The Reef can be seen from outer space, and includes popular tourist destinations such as the Whitsundays and Princess Charlotte Bay. The plan includes a ban on dumping dredge spoil anywhere in the world heritage area, a limit on port expansion to four sites and targets for reducing sediment, nutrient and pesticide contamination. The plan identifies climate change as one of the major threats, and aims to improve water quality. Queensland Environment Minister Steven Miles said run-off of sediment, nutrients and pesticides was the biggest medium term threat to the reef, which the plan addressed. 'With it, we will be able to convince the World Heritage Committee that not only should they not list the reef as in-danger but that we will actually keep the reef from being in danger,' he said. Greenpeace labelled the plan weak, as it still allows for massive coal port expansion and did not address climate change to a deserved extent, despite the report declaring this the main threat facing the Reef. The Commonwealth Government has committed a further $100 million for the Reef Trust, in addition to the $40 million provided by the Coalition last year.

'Australians are rightfully proud of the Great Barrier Reef and recognise its immense biological, economic and cultural value,' said the statement. 'Together, we are committed to protecting it for future generations.' The Federal Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt released a statement with Mr Abbott highlighted that the continued increase in water quality was a focus of the plan. 'The work that’s being undertaken to improve water quality builds on the Commonwealth Government’s total and permanent ban on the dumping of capital dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,' the statement said. 'The heart of this plan is about better quality, with hard targets including a 50 per cent reduction in nitrogen by 2018 and an 80 per cent reduction by 2025,' Mr Hunt said at the release of the plan.

"A woman in Oregon has pleaded guilty to having an illegal relationship with her biological father, who she never knew growing up. Chalena Moody, 25, was sentenced to 10 days in jail on the incest charge, but got credit for time already served and won't have to serve any additional days behind bars. She also received 18 months probation. The authorities say Moody and her father, Eric Lee Gates, 49, were living as a couple in Springfield, before moving to Klamath Falls and had two children under two years of age. Chalena Moody, 25, has pleaded guilty to having an illegal relationship with her biological father Eric Lee Gates, 49. They have been living as couple in Springfield, Oregon, and have two young kids . A third died in utero, according to county prosecutors. The two children have numerous medical issues and are now in the custody of the state, reports The Register-Guard. 'There's issues with the children, and they've been put into foster care,' said Sgt. Dave Lewis with Springfield Police. 'It's not a good situation all around.' As part of her probation, Moody cannot have any contact with Gates. He is serving 60 days in the Lane County Jail for violating his probation and moving in with Moody following his guilty plea and subsequent sentencing to the same probationary terms. Gates was also ordered to pay restitution to the State of Oregon for the medical expenses of the two children. Gates is serving 60 days in the Lane County Jail for violating his probation and moving in with Moody following his guilty plea to the incest charge . Authorities say Gates was not Moody's custodial parent during her childhood, as he served several stints in prison while she was growing up. Chalena Moody was sentenced to 10 days in jail on the incest charge and also received 18 months probation . Court records show at least one of those prison terms was for a felony conviction of driving with a suspended license. However, Gates and Moody reconnected in recent years and started their relationship. Springfield police Detective Dave Lewis said Gates and Moody openly admitted to their consensual relationship, to being father-daughter and also conceiving children together. DNA tests were performed on the family, and it was determined that Gates and Moody were related and had children from an incestuous relationship, Lewis said. Oregon State law defines incest as when a person marries or engages in sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse with another whom the person knows to be related to them, either legitimately or illegitimately, as an ancestor, descendant, brother or sister of either whole or half-blood. Incest is a Class C felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and $125,000 in fines.","Chalena Moody, 25, has pleaded guilty to having an illegal relationship with her biological father Eric Lee Gates, 49 .

"It's a common practice for people to leave honest appraisals of a hotel after their stay, and they are often scathing and highly critical. However, after one too many rude guests, a hotel group has decided to start reviewing their guests and publishing their scorecard online. Art Series Hotel Group will trial a new program, 'Reverse Review' at their six hotels in Victoria and South Australia. It gives the hotel staff the opportunity to rate guests' behaviour and post their scorecard online. Scroll down for video . The six hotels that are part of the Art Series Hotel Group will trial a 'Reverse Review' system to rate the behaviour of their guests - including cleanliness and manners . The Art Series Hotel's hotels (pictured) intend the program as a fun activity for guests with a chance to reward their best guests with free accommodation . 'Think you're the perfect hotel guest?' the ad asks. 'Stay and request to be reviewed at any of our hotels from April 17 until May 31. 'Get four or five stars and get a free night to stay again. But be warned, if you misbehave, everyone will know!' Art Series Hotel Group Marketing Director Ryan Tuckerman said the program has been inspired by online review website 'TripAdvisor' and is intended as a fun activity for guests and staff alike. 'Reverse Reviews flips the process on its head and provides a way for us to recognise and reward good behaviour in a fun and light-hearted way.' 'These days everyone's a critic. The internet has enabled people to rate every film, restaurant or latte they experience, good or bad,' the hotels' website explains. 'So what would happen if we made it a two way street? 'We have many guests who fail to meet our standards but we didn't have a forum of our own - until now.' 'We have many guests who fail to meet our standards but we didn't have a forum of our own - until now,' the company says, explaining that guests are known to steal from or trash hotel rooms . The Hotel Group are curious to see if the fear of dirty laundry being aired in public affects their guests' behaviour. It comes after a study by Galaxy Research unveiled the truth about awful behaviour in Australian hotels and the filthy acts that go on behind closed doors. The number of people game enough to admit that they are guilty of trashing rooms, parading naked in front of windows and stealing proves that even grown adults run amuck when they're away from home. One in ten people steal items like bedding, irons and light globes from hotels. 'We even have guests who pilfer the batteries from our television remotes, bless them,' added Tuckerman. The number of people game enough to admit that they are guilty of trashing rooms, parading naked in front of windows and stealing proves that even grown adults run amuck when they're away from home . 400,000 people confess that they have trashed a hotel room, with the hotel remarking: 'I'm sure not all of them are rock stars'. 20 per cent of people confessed that they'd walked in front of windows naked. Also, the study found that wealthier people are more likely to misbehave and 'the poorer you are the less likely you are to take an item without paying'. According to the study, the ideal hotel guest is a woman from regional Victoria or Tasmania aged 50-plus, married with no blue-collar jobs with an income of $40 thousand or less a year. A person fitting this description has been found to be less likely of committing an anti-social act. 'We do have special guests; one who always greet us with a smile and make us want to come to work. The number of people game enough to admit that they are guilty of trashing rooms, parading naked in front of windows and stealing proves that even grown adults run amuck when they're away from home . 'We want to bring them back for an extra night, because these are the kind of guests we want at Art Series Hotel.' The hotel divulges that 60 per cent of people staying in their penthouse have been awarded an upgrades, specifically rewarded to people who have been pleasant, clean and walked around with a smile on their face. So, what does one need to do to score a five star rating? 'There are some insider tips and tricks that are simple and really make the day of the hotel team,' Tuckerman explains. 'These include exchanging day to day pleasantries, putting the sign out on the door as soon as your room is ready to be made up, opting to have your linen changed less frequently and keeping dirty towels in a pile.' Resisting the urge to steal the amenities is also looked upon fondly.

"GET THE TRUTH . by Philip Houston, Michael Floyd and Susan Carnicero . (Icon Books £12.99) Ever wanted to know the best way of extracting a confession? Me neither, but here’s an unexpectedly fascinating book that shows how to do just that. Interrogation is an unfortunate name with regrettable connotations . Not only will you learn how to have the guilty singing like canaries, this book also comes up with some genuinely important insights about the interrogation process. Ah, interrogation. Such an unfortunate term, with such regrettable connotations. Torture, screaming agony, electrodes, waterboarding — those kind of connotations. Yes, but it needn’t be like that, say the authors, former CIA officers who are painfully aware of what ‘CIA interrogation’ is taken to mean — torture, screaming agony, electrodes, waterboarding — and who are appalled by that reputation. I think the authors are also against torture and pain on ethical grounds, but the nature of their disgust is partly professional. Because it turns out that interrogation-by-torment is ineffective, as the CIA’s skilled specialists have known for some time. Only rank amateurs would ever try to extract confessions and information by upping the voltage or giving the thumbscrews another turn. The only approach that has any chance of success, state the authors, is exactly the opposite. Professionals who really know what they’re doing try to take all traces of violence or confrontation out of an interrogation, turning it instead into an interview based on chummy sympathy and understanding. Good interrogators will lower their voice, talk slowly, claim empathy with their suspects and then — well, and then just keep on talking lowly and slowly seems to be the gist. Because what appears to work best is an interrogator who chats on and on, quietly, reassuringly, understandingly, often repetitively. ‘We all make mistakes, Brian. Nobody’s saying we don’t make mistakes because, you know, Brian, we all make mistakes,’ and so on and on and on. The comforting drone of the interrogator’s monologue may sound mindless, but it is carefully created and should contain five key features. These are rationalising the action (you needed the money); projecting the blame (it was their fault for not paying you enough); minimising the seriousness (we’ve all nicked Post-it notes); socialising the situation (this kind of thing happens a lot, it’s nothing we haven’t seen a million times); and emphasising the truth (if you could explain what happened when you took the money, that would be great and would help us all move on). Acts of terrible violence, gross betrayals, fraud, theft, murder — the skilled interrogator will mimic thorough understanding of the worst crimes to keep up the pretence of being on the suspect’s side. Number of tweets the CIA monitors every day . At the same time, the interrogator will be intent on keeping that suspect locked into a mode of short-term thinking — keeping the focus on particulars and specifics, trying like crazy to stop the suspect considering the long-term consequences of telling an implicating truth and being found guilty. It is a process that has had enormous success, claim the authors, though this is a success that is anecdotal. But the anecdotes are pretty convincing. Take the example of Abu Zubaydah, one of the first Al Qaeda leaders to be captured, who was being successfully won over by the pretend empathy approach until a hardliner applied torture instead — and found his victim clammed up. The book consists mainly of such case studies from the authors’ interrogating careers, supplemented weirdly with 70-odd pages of commentary by a lawyer type who adds his own legal anecdotes to make the same points. Presumably, this book is meant to show how the CIA’s interrogation techniques can be applied in the normal world. But it struck me that here was an opportunity missed, since there isn’t any effective attempt to transfer the professionals’ methods to everyday situations: how to winkle out the truth about which child broke the kitchen window, how to get your partner to fess up about what really happened at the office party. But though it misses that trick, this book does find itself making, I think to its own surprise, a genuine and important contribution to the ongoing debate, particularly in the U.S., about the use of torture such as waterboarding during interrogations of terrorists. Forget any ethical argument, say the authors — any form of physical coercion, far less torture, just doesn’t work.","Ever wanted to know the best way of extracting a confession?

"A pine marten has been spotted in southern England for the first time in more than 50 years. It was caught on film scuttling in the undergrowth by a student using a night vision camera near his home in Bude, Cornwall. Jack Merritt, 18, sent footage of the creature to experts, who identified it as a young female. 'I filmed it by chance and knew I had captured something different,' Jack said. 'I had no idea of its significance to start with though. Unusual sight: A pine martin, like the one pictured, was spotted in southern England for the first time in half a century . 'I spoke to a few friends who had some suggestions but decided to send it to someone who may have a better idea of what it was all about. 'It is quite a shock and I don't really know what to make of it to be honest. 'You don't really expect to have something like this happen but it is fascinating and I am so glad I was out filming at the time.' The teenager sent the footage to ecologist Derek Gow - a specialist in the reintroduction of indigenous species. Mr Gow said: 'The footage taken by Jack is simply amazing. To the best of anyone's knowledge pine martens were believed to be extinct in Southern England after centuries of ruthless persecution by furriers and gamekeepers. 'It's really great to see the see the footage he obtained of what would appear to be a young female. Exciting spot: A student in Cornwall captured a pine marten on camera, exciting wildlife experts who say there have been no sightings in southern England for 50 years . 'Hopefully this sighting could result in further reintroductions of this delightful creature into other areas of suitable habitat in the South West.' The pine marten is a relative of the weasel and used to be Britain's second most common carnivore. It was hunted for its fur and almost wiped out in the 1800s. The size of a cat but slender with brown fur, a bushy tail and a creamy yellow throat, it is nocturnal. In the UK, it is common only in the Scottish Highlands, with most sightings in England and Wales in rugged areas such as the Lake District and Snowdonia.","Animal was once Britain's second most common carnivore .

"Fast food chain Red Rooster has been slammed by the Food Intolerance Network for making 'misleading and erroneous' advertising claims about their food being preservative and MSG free . Fast food chain Red Rooster has been slammed by a lobby group for making 'misleading and erroneous' advertising claims that its food is free of 'anything artificial'. The Food Intolerance Network, made up of over 10,000 Australian and New Zealand families, has lodged a complaint against the fast food giant with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), claiming that Red Rooster's product range is filled with artificial additives and MSG despite the company's claims of the contrary. Dr Howard Denagte, the co-founder of the network who has a doctrine in food technology, told Daily Mail Australia that by simply studying the nutritional information provided for each product on Red Rooster's website, he managed to identify over 12 items with MSG and seven synthetic antioxidants in various items. These include artificial additives that were identified as of concern for children by the Commonwealth Department of Health. 'Their advertisement clearly stated ""you won't find anything artificial in any of the food made by us""; that is misleading,' Dr Dengate said. He said that other false claims made by Red Rooster since September were '100 per cent Australian Canola Oil' and 'Our chicken nuggets… are preservative free'. 'Synthetic antioxidant 319 tert-Butylhydroquinone tBHQ is in the canola oil used to cook the Cheesy Nuggets and Nuggets. While this is not technically a preservative it is added to preserve the oil, and the oil is not '100 per cent' as claimed. The products contain ingredients that are artificial,' Dr Dengate's complaint states. Co-founder of the group and food technologist Howard Denagte took this screen shot of what he described as a 'misleading' advertisement by the fast food giant . However he claims the company has since changed the wording on their website . Dr Dengate said that by simply studying the nutritional information provided for each product on Red Rooster's website, he managed to identify over 12 items with MSG and seven synthetic antioxidants in various items . 'Preservative 220 sulphur dioxide is in the Guilt-free Tenders salad dressing. This additive requires a public warning on any ingredient label due to asthma concerns. Their website currently claims incorrectly that there is no sulphite present. This product contains this ingredient which is artificial.' Red Rooster's national marketing manager, Anna Jones, told Daily Mail Australia that the company stood by their claims that 'there are no artificial colours, flavours or added MSG present in any meals we prepare.' 'This has been verified by Siliker, a global leader in food safety and quality, who acted as an independent auditor to ensure everything prepared by Red Rooster was free of artificial colours, flavours or added MSG,' Ms Jones said. However Dr Denagte claims Red Rooster has changed the wording in their advertisements - which stated 'there's no... MSG in the meals we prepare' - since the complaint was lodged with the ACCC, saying: 'basically, they essentially pleaded guilty'. 'In fact it's hard to find any food product they have there that doesn't contain MSG,' Dr Denagte said. 'By now they have changed it to say 'no added MSG'… but any food chemist asked to analyse these foods would find MSG despite the lawyer's trick. 'In fact it's hard to find any food product they have there that doesn't contain MSG,' Dr Denagte said . 'It is our view that hydrolysed vegetable protein and yeast extract are artificial products in that protein is broken down, typically by boiling with hydrochloric acid, then neutralising the slurry with sodium hydroxide, resulting in high concentrations of the sodium cation and the glutamate anion. This is MSG by any chemical understanding.' MSG can be found in Red Roosters roast chicken, chicken stuffing, chicken salt, gravy, chicken nuggets, combi salt, rosemary sprinkle, chip salt and most sauces, according to the Food Intolerance Network's complaint. 'I'd like them to stop making misleading and erroneous claims in their advertising and I'd like them ideally remove more artificial substance form the food they're selling,' Dr Dengate said. Daily Mail Australia have contacted Red Rooster for comment . Red Rooster has retaliated by arguing that they could accurately claim their meals were 'free of added MSG'. 'We also note the comments today of Professor Peter Clifton, a nutrition expert at the University of South Australia, who confirmed we could accurately claim our meals are free of added MSG as glutamate, an amino acid, is found in all protein foods and our glutamate rises whenever we eat any protein,' Ms Jones said. 'With regard to the suggestions that our canola oil is not 100 per cent Australian and our chicken nuggets are not preservative free, after reconfirming with our certifiers and suppliers in the past 24 hours we again reject these comments as inaccurate. 'Red Rooster has no record of any contact or complaint from the Food Intolerance Network, however we would be happy to sit down with their members to provide clarity around the issues they have raised and to correct some unfounded claims.'","The Food Intolerance Network lodged a complaint against Red Rooster with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)

"A computer programmer who killed his girlfriend and then almost got away with it after staging a cover-up has been jailed for five years. Edward Metcalfe claimed that the death of Tracey Topliss, 47, had been a tragic accident after she fell down the stairs at their home in Hall Green, Birmingham. A post-mortem also ruled that her death had been an accident, but after a friend of the victim told police of domestic violence within the relationship, police re-investigated the case and charged Metcalfe with murder. Edward Metcalfe, right, who has been jailed for five years following the death of his partner Tracey Topliss, left. Her death had initially been ruled as an accident . Today following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, he was acquitted of murder but convicted of the manslaughter of his partner of 13 years and jailed. The court heard how Miss Topliss, a National Grid worker, was killed on November 15 in 2013 at the couple's home. Both she and Metcalfe, 36, had been drinking after she received the news that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer. Hugh O'Brien Quinn, prosecuting, said that following an initial post-mortem, it had been concluded that Miss Topliss's death had been accidental. The judge told Metcalfe, pictured, that his behaviour had been 'utterly selfish' and that he showed a 'complete lack of remorse' However, he added: 'That was until Mrs Sharon Wade contacted the police and told them of her concerns. 'She had been a good friend of Tracey Topliss. It was to her that Miss Topliss had complained about domestic violence from her partner.' It was then that a second post-mortem was conducted and the court heard how the pathologist discovered an injury to the victim's cheek, consistent with a heavy punch. Judge Paul Farrer QC said that Miss Topliss was a 'hard-working, successful and well-respected by her professional colleagues.' Addressing Metcalfe, he added: 'There must have been some disagreement between you which caused you to lose your temper. 'You delivered a significant punch to the right side of her face. The blow caused her to fall backwards and strike her head against a table. 'You thought of nobody but yourself. Rather than trying to help her or call the emergency services, you left her lying on the floor of the hallway. 'You waited approximately for two-and-a-half hours before dialling 999. 'Your behaviour was utterly selfish and betrayed a complete lack of remorse. You showed a callous disregard for your victim.' However, David Crigman QC, defending said: 'What he has been found guilty of is one punch with disastrous consequences. 'It must have happened within seconds. There was no evidence of a protracted argument. But for her falling backwards and hitting her head, the deceased would not have suffered a serious injury.' Metcalfe was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter and jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court . Metcalfe was then jailed for five years and after the hearing, Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Edward Metcalfe initially deceived the authorities into believing that Miss Topliss died as a result of a tragic accident. 'He nearly got away with it. His crime was discovered as a result of community vigilance and courage. 'This goes to show that the police need the active cooperation from the community to eradicate the evil that is domestic abuse and bring offenders to justice.'","Tracey Topliss died after falling down the stairs at her home in Birmingham .

"The callous owner of this tiny Rottweiler puppy threw her out with the rubbish after severe spinal damage left her unable to stand. Vets made the difficult decision to put the stricken three-month-old animal to sleep due to the serious nature of her injuries. The puppy was found curled up in a cardboard box and dumped next to some bins in Enfield, north London. Vets were forced to put down this dumped three-month-old Rottweiler puppy after it was unable to stand due to severe spinal damage . A second newborn Rottweiler cross, believed to be from the same litter, was found nearby and showed signs of mistreatment. Anna White, manager at the RSPCA's Southridge Animal Centre, in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, described it as one of the saddest cases she has seen. 'This poor puppy was brought to us in the cardboard box she was found in, and could not stand up, let alone walk, and definitely could not get out of the box,' she said. 'Her back legs were just not working properly and she was very, very poorly. And yet she was just left like this, on her own, on a busy London street in the freezing cold. 'She was tossed out, when she was at her most vulnerable. It is just heartbreaking.' X-rays revealed the dog had extensive spinal damage but vets were unable to ascertain whether it was due to the abuse or a birth defect. RSPCA inspector Kate Ford said: 'We do not know how this poor dog came to be dumped in this way and can't be sure whether her health issues were something she was born with or were the result of some mistreatment. 'She was of a very distinct silver-hued colouring, and there have also been reports of other puppies in the area of North London with similar colouring, also being mistreated, so the concern is that there could be others out there in need of help. The eight puppies could have died after being dumped in a rubbish bin in Queenferry, North Wales . Eight tiny newborn puppies found in a rubbish bin were at the centre of an RSPCA investigation. The tiny pups - some with their umbilical cords still attached - were discovered by a group of a children in Queensferry, North Wales. Bosses from the animal charity said they were stunned at how someone could throw away the animals as if they were rubbish. As well as praising the quick-thinking actions of the youngsters who contacted a local dog warden after yesterday's shocking discovery in Chester Road East, officials also urged anyone with information to come forward. RSPCA inspector Tim Jones said: 'It is totally unnecessary and these puppies could have died if nobody had heard them. They could not be seen in the bin. 'They all appeared to be fine but are very young as some of them had their umbilical cords still attached.' 'We are appealing for information to try and find out who abandoned these tiny dogs.' The puppies - thought to be Staffordshire bull terrier cross-breeds - are now being cared for the RSPCA. Anyone with information on the puppies should contact the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.","Three-month-old Rottweiler puppy found dumped by bins in Enfield .

"A real estate investment trust (REIT) that's considering getting out of the snow business could end up making the largest single ski resort transaction in the sport's history. CNL Lifestyle Properties owns more than a dozen ski resorts from Maine to California that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. If CNL sells all of its 16 properties to one buyer, industry officials say it would be the biggest real estate transaction in the history of skiing. Scroll down for video . CNL Lifestyle Properties owns more than a dozen ski resorts like Sunday River in Maine (pictured above) The 16 resorts the trust owns stretch from Maine to California and they're worth hundreds of millions of dollars . If CNL sells all 16 properties to one buyer,  it would be the biggest real estate deal in the history of skiing . If the firm's resorts - which include Sunday River and Sugarloaf in Maine, Bretton Woods, Loon Mountain and Mount Sunapee in New Hampshire, Okemo Mountain in Vermont, Crested Butte in Colorado, Brighton in Utah, and Northstar-at-Tahoe and Sierra-at-Tahoe in California - do sell, skiers might not even notice because the resort operators' long-term leases will remain in place even if the properties change hands. REITs bring in revenue through rent paid by ski resort operators like Michigan-based Boyne Resorts, which holds long-term leases for Sunday River, Sugarloaf and Loon Mountain. A Boyne official said skiers needn't worry about the potential sale of their beloved ski mountains. Steve Kircher, president of eastern operations for Boyne, said: 'For the skier, it's a nonevent.' CNL Financial Group managing director Steve Rice said the trust will make decisions 'in the near future' Boyne will remain the lease holder, regardless of ski resort ownership, for several more decades. Bob Rogowsky, who skies 70 to 80 days a year at Sunday Rive and recently bought a retirement home in the area, said most skiers are pleased with the investments that have been made since CNL bought the resort and Boyne began running it in 2007. He said: 'I wouldn't have made that kind of financial commitment and lifetime commitment if I didn't believe there was stability and a good future.' Ski resorts, which are at the mercy of weather and the economy, can be good investments as long the owners have a long investment horizon, said Michael Krongel from Mirus Resort Capital. The trust will evaluate options for its remaining properties  'in the near future', according to CNL Financial Group senior managing director Steve Rice. Besides selling its ski resorts, theme parks and marinas, alternatives include a private buyout or listing on a publicly traded exchange. Ideally, the remaining properties would be sold and CNL enlisted investment bank Jefferies LLC to help evaluate options. Rice said: 'We're taking a studied and careful approach.' If the resorts do sell, skiers might not even notice because the operators' long-term leases will remain in place . REITs are an investment vehicle for a variety of properties including hotels, office buildings and malls, but they are new to the ski industry in the last 15 or so years. There's only one other REIT that's a big player in the ski industry besides CNL. CNL Lifestyle Properties was valued at as much as $3billion in 2012 with ownership of more than 100 water parks, ski resorts, marinas and senior housing developments. The trust's value dropped in the aftermath of a real estate downturn. The REIT is nearing the end of its projected lifespan and anticipates having an 'exit strategy' in place by Dec. 31. In June, CNL agreed to sell 48 golf properties for $320million. Then it announced an agreement to sell its senior housing for $790million in December. Besides selling the resorts, alternatives include a private buyout or listing on a publicly traded exchange .","CNL Lifestyle Properties could sell off all the properties it owns in one deal .

"The embattled former First Lady of Oregon has compared herself to Monica Lewisnky in a Facebook post in which she blasted the media for turning 'public humiliation into a commodity and shame into an industry.' Cylvia Hayes' fiancé John Kitzhaber was forced to resign as governor in February over allegations that he helped steer business to her environmental consulting firm and then cover up the activity. The couple are now facing federal corruption investigations from both the FBI and IRS - though no charges have been levied. Cylvia Hayes' fiancé John Kitzhaber was forced to resign over allegations that he helped steer business to her environmental consulting firm . Hayes compared her own public humiliation with that of Monic Lewinsky, who spoke out about having her life laid bare following revelations of her affair with President Bill Clinton . On Tuesday, Hayes posted a link to a TED Talk by Lewinsky called 'The Price of Shame' in which the infamous former White House intern says criticizes the 'rush to judgement' in the media over revelations of her affair with President Bill Clinton. 'Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide,' Lewinsky says. Hayes shared the link with the comment: 'I am so appreciative of her for taking this on. 'This is a powerful statement about how our click-for-cash media business model has turned public humiliation into a commodity and shame into an industry.' It was Hayes' first time speaking out since her fiancé's resignation on on February. She also tweeted out a link to an apology written by a Politico reporter who accused two Secret Service agents of crashing into a barricade while drunk outside the White House. The details of that incident remain unclear. This is the latest example of Hayes and Kitzhaber blaming the media for being forced out of the governor's office. When he resigned Kitzhaber, who has just won a fourth term as governor, blasted the press - saying, 'it is deeply troubling to me to realize that we have come to a place in the history of this great state of ours where a person can be charged, tried, convicted and sentenced by the media with no due process and no independent verification of the allegations involved.'","Cylvia Hayes blasted news media for turning 'public humanization into a commodity and shame into an industry'

"Chart-topping singer Lorde has thrown her support behind her fellow countryman, Joe Irvine, who is at the centre of New Zealand's The X Factor controversy that ended in two judges being fired from the reality show. The 18-year-old songstress, who is originally from Auckland, sent Irvine cupcakes and a touching note after he was roasted by British singers Natalia Kills and Willy Moon following his rendition of Justin Timberlake's Cry Me A River on the show on Sunday. When giving her feedback to The X Factor contestant, Kills accused Irvine of copying husband Moon's style. Scroll down for video . New Zealand chart-topper Lorde sent Joe Irvine cupcakes and a handwritten note to show her support . Lorde is also from New Zealand and wrote: 'Just wanted to say: your individuality, positive energy and spirit are infectious!' Her comments, along with her spouse's, caused a social media storm, with people calling for their sacking. The network which airs the show, TV3, bowed to pressure and immediately fired the husband-and-wife duo. Support for Irvine came from all over the world, including from British singer Ed Sheeran, as people took to the internet, accusing Kills of copying the likes of Madonna, Lady Gaga and Willy Wonka. But Lorde took it one step further and sent the humbled Irvine a box of cupcakes which spelled out 'Keep Being Joe' and a handwritten letter. 'Just wanted to say: your individuality, positive energy and spirit are infectious!' the Royals singer wrote. 'I think you're doing on awesome job on the show so far. New Zealand's The X Factor contestant Joe Irvine was berated by judge Natalia Kills for stealing her husband's style . But the tirade did not stop with Kills, her husband - Willy Moon - also dished out his own harsh criticisms . 'I’m a performer too and I wanted to say that no matter how many people make fun of me for how I dress, move and act, I’m being me – and that’s what’s important. Good luck and lots of love, Lorde.' Irvine tweeted his appreciate of the gesture on his Twitter account, which now has more than 12,000 followers. 'Hey you are awsome [sic] I love ur music and wanna meet you thank u so much for the cupcakes xo,' he said. It comes as users on Twitter point out Natalia Kills' own look is far from original. They have pointed out the Bradford-born singer appears to have drawn inspiration from a range of different artists including Jessie J, Lady Gaga and even Johnny Depp for fashion tips of her own. Kills launched into a tirade at Joe on the first of the live shows, saying: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelgänger in our midst. 'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband.' Natalia's comments seemed to be based around the fact Joe had his hair slicked back and was wearing a suit, a look favoured by her husband of ten months. Yet users on Twitter soon posted pictures that showed how Natalia's own  hair and make-up bears a striking resemblance to styles worn by Lily Allen and Elizabeth Taylor. Some of the the funnier comparisons include Johnny Depp in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Lord Farquaad from Shrek. She's even been compared to astrologer Mystic Meg and Lady Gaga. British singer Natalia Kills said she was 'disgusted' at the fact that she thought he looked like Moon . Twitter users were quick to comment on the fact that many of Kills' looks seem to have been influenced by other people, this hilarious example compares her to Johnny Depp in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory . Kills has also been accused of stealing looks from Lady Gaga, these two images show the two women rocking remarkably similar styles . In one picture comparison on Twitter, Natalia's bun, blunt fringe and cat eye make-up looks similar to a look worn by Lady Gaga. While other shots showed pictures of Natalia posing with her hand over one eye which echoed one of Lady Gaga's own photo poses. Another black and white shot of Natalia sees her posing with fingers pointing at her temples, miming having a gun pointing to her head. Singer MIA also posed the same way in a black and white photograph. But when asked about Natalia's look being similar to other celebrities' style, a spokesperson for her said: 'I have known and worked with Natalia for over 15 years - she speaks from her heart and says what's she's feeling. 'She's a very talented and passionate young lady. Natalia has always had her own style and many leading international designers are always sending her outfits.' This montage of pictures shows Kills looking strikingly similar to Lady Gaga (right), Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra (center) and the singer MIA (left) Another funny example compared Kills to Lord Farquaad, an animated character from the hit movie Shrek . But in her The X Factor attack last night, Kills - who was born Natalia Noemi Keery-Fisher - lambasted Irvine further,  saying: 'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?' She added: ‘You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious. 'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.' Irvine, who was appearing on the first live episode looked visibly upset by her comments and at one point seemed to be fighting back the tears. Moon, from Wellington, who she married last May, added:  'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd. 'It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.' This user joked that the cartoon character Dore The Explorer would be mad Kills had stolen her hairstyle . There has been several posts which compare Kills to Lady Gaga, here the pair shares a similar hair style and sunglasses to the singer . And Kills' outburst was not the first time she had raised eyebrows while filming The X Factor. When she first joined the show she was criticised after one round of auditions in Auckland where she apparently swore and screamed at audience members, which included children. At the time, a representative for the show confirmed the incident saying: 'During a long day of filming, The X Factor NZ judge Natalia Kills expressed frustration at the behaviour of some sections of the audience. 'Her words were not well chosen, and both Natalia and TV3 apologise for any offence caused.' Since being dropped from the talent show, Natalia  tweeted saying: 'I love you guys, thanks for your support & understanding my passionate opinions! You know what they say about me...' She added a link to her video for her song Problem which includes the chorus: 'That girl is a problem.' Natalia's hair has been compared to Jessie J (centre) and even Mystic Meg (left) This Twitter user joked that Madonna had called and wanted her hair back . But the controversial singer and songwriter who, despite working with Madonna and the DJ David Guetta, until last night was barely known in her home country. Born in West Yorkshire, the grammar school girl travelled extensively with her parents between Jamaica, the UK and Spain. She became a child actress aged nine and appeared in the BBC's All About Me, voiced Amy Franks in the Radio 4 soap The Archers and made appearances in Casualty, Doctors and Coronation Street. Her father experienced a spell in prison and at the age of 14 she left home and began pursuing a music career in earnest in 2003. Kills said: 'I moved out when I was almost 15 and spent my whole teenage years with no money, fighting with my boyfriend, joining a cult and getting in trouble with the police.' She has spoken about having suffered with depression and having been suicidal in her younger years. And, when in 2013 she released her album Trouble she told Life and Times she wanted to use it to confess all the bad things she had ever done. According to Kills these included: 'Stalking my ex-boyfriend, trying to set fire to the house with us both in it, getting taken away by the police, leaving home at 15, making out with strangers and running away to Paris.' She told Digital Spy: 'I remember when I was 19, I loved my boyfriend who didn't love me back so much - disturbingly much - that every time he hurt me I just desperately wanted to jump off the highest bridge I could find, or walk into the fastest truck. 'I was just completely out of control of my erratic feelings of love and passionate desperation.' Yet Kills has admitted in the past that she feels remorse over her actions, telling Electrocutie Music that her album Trouble was inspired by her rocky life: 'You know what? I do have regrets. 'The album is actually full of regret. There was a point where I left home and was trying to be a grown-up. I had an awful boyfriend who treated me badly. 'I wound up in a religious cult that I was in for a few years. It kind of shaped my mind to be good and do the right thing. I felt like “doing good” went against my inner nature.'","Singer Lorde has thrown her support behind X Factor contestant Joe Irvine .

"These are the faces of a continent - Africa up close and personal. The tight frames they are shot in barely seem to hold these people as they stand proud and stark against deep black backgrounds. The images are the work of John Kenny, a 38-year-old photographer who has spent much of the past decade travelling around south, east and west Africa, pointing his camera at the most unforgettable faces he can find.

A lady from Ethiopia's Hamar tribe (right). Along with the two countries Kenny has also travelled to Namibia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mail, Angola, Niger, Togo and Burkina Faso . And there is a young Hamar girl, also from Ethiopia, whose neck is festooned with hundreds of tiny glass beads and dainty white shells. It seems as if there's no room for any more jewellery but as she has yet to find a husband or have a proposal accepted by her father, there are none of the metal necklaces worn from engagement onwards that denote the social status of married women. Kenny has travelled round 13 African countries photographing traditional tribesmen and women. These include Namibia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mail, Angola, Niger, Togo and Burkina Faso on an odyssey which began in 2006 when he made his first six-month trip to Africa. The end result of these years of work in tribal African societies is a book, ‘Facing Africa’, that was released in late 2013. Back in 2006, he says, 'at the very start of my Africa journey, I was buzzing with energy having met people of real magnetism just days into my trip. These young Mumuhuila girls from Angola illustrate the obsessive pride the women of the tribe take in their hair thanks to the colourful beads, shells and animal oils woven into its strands. Kenny travelled through 13 countries to capture intense subjects like these . This mother and child are from the Daasanach ethnic group in Ethiopia. The man is from the Nyangatom people in the same country. There are only around 30,000 of them and many are Nyangatom are nomadic, residing in mobile livestock villages that may migrate several times a year . This lady is also from the Nyangatom people (left). The girl on the right from Niger is a member of the Hausafulani people . 'I was excited by extraordinary people and fascinating cultures and wondered how I could possibly communicate and express these feelings of excitement to friends and family back home.' Kenny's solution was to remove his subjects from all context, shooting them indoors away from what he calls the 'dull and dusty backgrounds of their immediate environment'. He adds: 'I started to imagine each of these people in front of me emerging from the nothingness of darkness, with no distractions, hoping that this would provide a real feeling of proximity between the viewer and the person in the picture.' The result is to bring out the vividness of the colours and the immediacy of the people's expressions - sometimes playful, often intense but always arresting. Kenny says: 'It's simply the illumination of natural sunlight, and sun on dry earth, that reaches into the darkness of huts and lights up these remarkable people.

'In Africa I seem to have made it my goal to travel through some of the remotest areas of the continent where the reaches of urbanisation and 21st century living are barely detectable.' Kenny was shot at in northern Kenya in 2009. He and his guide were driving along a highway one evening when they glimpsed tiny white flashes ahead of them and were soon engulfed in gunfire.

"A team hunting for the legendary 'lost city' of Ciudad Blanca in Honduras has made a dramatic discovery of untouched ruins deep in the jungle that are thought to be thousands of years old, according to National Geographic. Researchers believe the complex of plazas, mounds, a pyramid and dozens of artefacts belong to a civilization which was blooming thousands of years ago and then vanished without a trace. It prompts the tantalizing possibility that they have found the lost civilization known as the White City, which as been the subject of local rumors among tribes people and Spanish explorers around the la Mosquita area of jungle in Honduras for hundreds of years. Some people call it the White City Of Gold, after ancient texts described ivory temples filled with treasure - and western explorers first made reference to it from conquistador Hernando Cortes to King Charles V of Spain in 1526. Since then countless adventurers have scoured the jungle for the ancient civilization, rumored to have enjoyed treasures beyond the wildest dreams of many budding Indiana Jones'. One such adventurer even suggested that the city was in fact known as the White City of the Monkey God, and saw an ancient civilization worship a giant simian deity, symbolized by a large statue. Theodore Morde, writing of his adventures in US  magazine The American Weekly, said that local tribes people told him of the monkey worshiping civilization and went on with even more outlandish suggestions that a monkey from the city. Locals even told him that one 'monkey god' from the city kidnapped a local woman and bred half-human, half-chimp children. The children were then hunted for revenge. Local tribes people also reportedly related the same story to an anthropologist, according to a Honduran media report. Morde said that local people told him of a huge monkey temple inhabited by a civilization known as the Chorotegas, and claimed to have fond evidence of such a place on his expedition in 1939-40. But Morde never revealed the location of his alleged find and killed himself in 1954. Scroll down for video . A sign of history? This block of stone could be a remnant of a temple built in the Lost City of Honduras thousands of years ago . Incredible: The aerial shots taken by National Geographic show luscious forestland where the City Of The Monkey God once thrived . However, despite archaeologists' following attempts to detect man-made structures - whether they be from Ciudad Blanca, The White City of the Monkey God or elsewhere -  have been unsuccessful. Until now. Traveling into uncharted territory last month, a National Geographic team found the mounds of white rubble in the shape of a monkey's skull that experts believe to be thousands of years old. The National Geographic's Douglas Preston wrote: 'The tops of 52 artifacts were peeking from the earth. Many more evidently lie below ground, with possible burials. 'They include stone ceremonial seats (called metates) and finely carved vessels decorated with snakes, zoomorphic figures, and vultures. 'The most striking object emerging from the ground is the head of what Fisher speculated might be 'a were-jaguar,' possibly depicting a shaman in a transformed, spirit state. 'Alternatively, the artifact might be related to ritualized ball games that were a feature of pre-Columbian life in Mesoamerica.' According to Theodore Morde, stone effigies of monkeys lined the approach to the city's central temple, which was built in the shape of the monkey God. He described the myth: 'One day three of the hairy men who looked like great apes walked into an Indian village and carried off three of its most beautiful and pleasing maidens. 'They took the girls back into the caves high in the mountains to live with them and bear their children. 'From this union came, however, not human nor partly human children but the small Urus or monkeys.' Discovery? American explorer Theodore Morde (left) wrote in 1939 that he had discovered the fabled city described by conquistador Hernando Cortes centuries before. Speaking to locals, he learned the city had been a shrine to the monkey God akin to Hindu's Hanuman who is pictured (right) hiding Rama and Sita, two more Hindu deities, in his heart to protect them. The Honduran monkey God is more menacing, he said . The lost city, believed to be full of gold, has merited two names based on legends. Texts cite 'la Ciudad Blanca' or 'the White City' it as the birthplace of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and old reports describe elaborately carved white stones. Other reports claim there once stood a giant monkey-shaped temple. There were also tales of a monkey stealing three women in the city and raping them to create half-monkey, half-human babies, warranting the name: The City Of The Monkey God. Either way, it has been sought since conquistador Hernando Cortes first made reference to it in a 1526 letter to King Charles V of Spain. It inspired the Dance Of The Dead Monkeys, during which locals roast monkeys over a fire in an apparent act of revenge for stealing their virgins. The first mention of the city came in Hernando Cortes' fifth letter to King Charles V of Spain in 1926, when he wrote that it will 'exceed Mexico in riches'. Historians believe, based on his description, that the city was in the region of Mosquitia - which was then, and remains now, impenetrably dangerous. '…I have trustworthy reports of very extensive and rich provinces,' he wrote, 'and of powerful chiefs ruling over them, and of one in particular, called Hueitapalan, and in another dialect Xucutaco, about which I possessed information six years since, having all this time made inquiries about it, and ascertained that it lies eight or ten days' march from that town of Trujillo, or rather between fifty and sixty leagues. 'So wonderful are the reports about this particular province, that even allowing largely for exaggeration, it will exceed Mexico in riches, and equal it in the largeness of its towns and villages, the density of its population, and the policy of its inhabitants.' Centuries later, in 1939, Theodore Morde rediscovered the site, and learned from locals that it was home to the myth of the monkey God. Writing in the Milwaukee Sentinel on September 22, 1940, apologized to his readers that he could not reveal the exact location other than the fact that it was shrouded by towering mountains, a 'rushing cataract, beautiful as a robe of shimmering jewels, cascading into the green valley of the ruins.' He added: 'More definite location than this I cannot give, because, as I have written, many are they who have sought for the Monkey God's City, attracted by tales of treasure, and we want to find it unmolested on our return journey in January.' His words have been echoed decades later by the Virgilio Parades, director of the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH), who warned the city and the surrounding rainforest could be obliterated in eight years if the government does not rush to protect it, El Heraldo reported. The latest discovery comes after researchers from the University of . Houston and the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) flew . over the Mosquitia region in a small plane shooting billions of laser . pulses at the ground to create a 3D digital map of the topology beneath . the jungle canopy. Compiling . their data, the analysts revealed what appears to be man-made elevation . changes that are thought to show a forgotten city plaza dotted with . pyramids reclaimed by the jungle. According to legend, Ciudad Blanca or the 'White City' is full of gold and has been sought out by explorers and treasure hunters since conquistador Hernando Cortes first made reference to it in a 1526 letter to King Charles V of Spain. Inspired by this legend, cinematographer and Ciudad Blanca enthusiast Steven Elkins sought backing from private investors to pay for the team at NCLAM to use their laser mapping technology to chart the forest floor of Mosquitia. Over the course of a week, the NCALM and University of Houston engineers flew over 60 square miles of forest in their dual-engine Cessna planes. LiDAR's computer-generated images allow researchers to 'see' through the . forest canopy to the ground surface, revealing any evidence of ancient . settlements or human-engineered landscapes. 'The LiDAR point cloud data clearly show the remains of large . settlements that can be characterized as ancient cities based on their . spatial complexity, size and organization,' said  Colorado State University professors Christopher Fisher, who led the research. 'We may never . be able to tell whether any of these are Ciudad Blanca, or whether the . legendary city ever existed, but we can clearly see in the UTL data . evidence that there was a densely settled region with a human modified . environment. 'These conclusions provide important new insights into the . pre-Hispanic settlement of this largely unexplored region.' This was one of the first times that . laser mapping, specifically light detection and ranging (LiDAR) had been . used to locate ancient ruins. Investigation: The University of Houston and National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping team produced this 3D digital topological map which when examined shows a man-made plaza ringed in red . The researchers first flew over the area and captured the treeline (top), and then were able to 'see through'  to the ground below (bottom image) The original uses of the technology were to provide intelligence after earthquakes, military spying and for river erosion detection. Flying above the intended target area, LiDAR operates by sending out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second. The University of Houston and the NCALM team blanketed the Mosquitia rainforest with as many as 25-50 laser pulses every square metre that totaled up as more than four billion shots during the entire project. Ciudad Blanca has played a central role in Central American mythology. Texts cite it as the birthplace of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and previous reported sightings over the years have described golden idols and elaborately carved white stones, leading to the lost city's name. However, no confirmation of the existence of the city has ever been provided. If confirmed, the discovery of Ciudad Blanca would be comparable to the popularisation of forgotten sites such as Machu Picchu, which lay ruined for hundreds of years until reintroduced to western eyes in 1911 by American historian Hiram Bingham.","National Geographic team ventured into Honduras rainforest to look for the fabled 'White City' filled with gold .

"Barack Obama has said that young Americans should be more worried about climate change than whether smoking pot was legal. The US President said the legalization of marijuana should come at the bottom of a long list of priorities for youths which also included the economy, war and peace. He was asked in an interview whether he legalising the drug would be part of his legacy as leader. Scroll down for video . Obama has said that young Americans should be worried about a lot more than whether smoking pot is legal . But Obama, who has previously admitted he used to smoke cannabis as a youngster, told Vice: 'First of all, it shouldn't be youngest people's biggest priority. Young people, I understand this is important to you, but you should be thinking about climate change, the economy, jobs, war and peace - maybe way at the bottom you should be thinking about marijuana.' So far, four states and the District of Columbia have legalized some recreational use of the drug, and 23 states and D.C. permit its use for medicinal purposes. But Obama said that the US justice system was 'skewed' towards non-violent drug offenders and the 'disproportionate' prison sentence came at the huge cost to communities and the state. The President has come out in favour of decriminalization as a way to tackle the skewed system but said he felt that the issue was very separate from encouraging people to use marijuana . He added that he felt 'encouraged' by the numbers of politicians, including conservative Republicans, who were beginning to see the cost of keeping the drug illegal didn't add up. Obama has been very open about his past experimentation with drugs and alcohol in high school. In 2006, then a New Hampshire Democratic presidential candidate, Obama was asked about his use of marijuana. When asked if he inhaled- a reference to former President Bill Clinton who, while admitting to trying marijuana, claimed he did not inhale - the future President said: 'I did. That was the point. 'It's not something I'm proud of. It was a mistake as a young man.' Obama also suggested that if medical marijuana was the best way to relieve pain and suffering then it was something he would be open to. 'We may actually be able to make progress on the decriminalization side,' he added, 'At a certain point, if enough states end up decriminalizing, then Congress may then re-schedule marijuana.' But while he appeared to take steps towards decriminalization, Obama warned legalization wasn't a 'panacea' and there will still many who had concerns about the drug's affect on society. There are currently 23 states and D.C. which allows marijuana  for medicinal purposes. The Controlled Substances Act on 1970 listed marijuana as a Schedule I drug making it illegal to manufacture, distribute or possess marijuana in the United States. But in August 2013, the U.S. Justice Department confirmed it wouldn't challenge Colorado or other states with laws legalizing recreational marijuana. Punishment for people found in possession of the drug currently depends on the location they were caught. For example, in Colorado, individuals aged over 21 can carry up to one ounce of cannabis and growing up to six marijuana plants at home without prosecution. The increasingly relaxed stance on the drug has seen a rise in the numbers of states looking to decriminalize or legalize the drug. In last year alone, Alaska, and Oregon voted to legalize recreational marijuana, which came into force this year, and Maryland became the 18th state to decriminalize the drug. Minnesota and New York became the 22nd and 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana in some form. They are likely to be swiftly followed by others next year when ballot initiatives in California, Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and Arizona other states are likely to be put to voters. Only this month, a trio of senators unveiled a package of drug reforms that would effectively end the federal war on medical marijuana. While it wouldn't legalize it, the bill would remove the threat of federal prosecution for patients who use it in states where it is legal.","Barack Obama said youth should be worried about more than if pot is legal .

"Hong Young, 35, the man accused of shooting at five public places in Maryland over a period of a week found out on Monday that his divorce case had been dismissed after his wife wasn't served the papers . The man accused of shooting at five public places in Maryland told police he heard voices directing him to fire at a random driver, according to charging documents released on Thursday. No one was killed or seriously hurt, but Hong Young, 35, is charged with attempted murder and assault in the first shooting — on February 24, at a mall — that wounded a 61-year-old man. The man, whose name is redacted in the charged documents, told police a car pulled up beside his, and the driver 'produced a gun and pointed it' at him. The man said he heard several shots and felt pain in his right shoulder, according to the documents, but it wasn't until he got home that he realized he'd been grazed by a bullet. The victim, identified as a Korean man, made the report with the help of his son, who translated for police. It was the first in a string of five shootings, including one at a National Security Agency building, that had central Maryland police on high alert for more than a week. Young was arrested on Tuesday night when officers spotted his car parked in a vacant mall lot close to the site of the first shooting. Young told the officers he had come from the Maryland Live! Casino and had trouble finding his car. The officers noticed shell casings in the car and a handgun on the front passenger seat. Police found an arsenal of weapons, including a crossbow and hundreds of rounds of ammunition when they searched Hong Young's home in Beltsville on Wednesday . Young was taken into custody, court records show, where he waived his right to have an attorney present during police questioning. Police said on Thursday that they were also investigating reports of damage to the exterior of the casino from possible bullet holes. Police said they were told of the damage by casino management on Wednesday. No injuries were reported nor were there any reports of shots fired. Law enforcement officials are still investigating a motive. 'Clearly, he was continuing to do it until he got caught,' Anne Arundel County Police spokesman T.J. Smith said. 'This guy apparently has some other issues going on (that) our detectives continue to follow up on.' Young filed for divorce in September after nearly seven years of marriage. The case was dismissed on Monday because his wife, Bunnary Ngo, had not been served with documents in the case, according to court records in Prince George's County. The man accused of shooting at five public places in Maryland told police he heard voices directing him to fire at a random driver, according to charging documents released on Thursday .

Police found hundreds of rounds of ammunition during a search of Young's house, along with 10 weapons, including handguns and a crossbow. Joy Abraham, 65, who lives next door to Hong's two-story red brick home, said he remembered the younger man seeming 'withdrawn.' Young had been taken to a hospital after his arrest but was later released and ordered held without bond at a maximum-security detention facility in Annapolis. He has a bail hearing before a judge set for Friday. Authorities said they didn't know whether he had an attorney to comment on the charges against Young, and none was listed for him in online court records. Young was a prison guard from January 2012 to May 2014, according to Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Secretary Stephen Moyer. 'There was nothing significant about his employment,' Moyer said. 'He was assigned to one of the medium (security) facilities in Jessup. He resigned. There was nothing remarkable about his file.' Investigators said they matched the casings and a .380 semi-automatic handgun to last week's shooting. The gun was legally registered to Young. The shooting sites are within a 12-mile radius in the Baltimore-Washington area.","Hong Young, 35, is accused of shooting at five public places in Maryland over a period of a week .

"A British man is in a serious condition in hospital after receiving a severe machete wound to the head after he was savagely attacked by a gang of robbers in Cambodia. Michael Hay was working as a cashier in a tourist bungalow on the exotic island of Koh Rong, 15 miles off the coast of Sihanoukville, when the gang burst in at 11.30pm on Thursday, lashing out with machetes and clubs. The 27-year-old was struck in the head by a long bush knife and also received a blow to the face with a club. Michael Hay was working as a cashier in a tourist bungalow on the exotic island of Koh Rong, 15 miles off the coast of Sihanoukville, when the gang burst in at 11.30pm on Thursday . He suffered a fractured cheekbone and an 11cm gash to his head, the Cambodia Daily reports. The owner of the Long Beach Bungalow, Jooni Huhani Nleml, 40, from Finland, also received a blow to the head. Both men were taken to Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh to be treated. ‘Both victims were attacked with knifes to the head and face and were injured seriously,’ Sihanoukville police chief Phul Phorsday said. ‘There were two or three perpetrators and we found knives, batons and rocks at the scene which were used as weapons.’ Cambodia South coast Kompong Song province Sihanoukville Koh Rong island Koh Toch or Koh Tui beach . Provincial police chief Seang Kosal said Mr Hay was working as a cashier at the bungalows - part of a large workforce of foreign backpackers who have descended on Sihanoukville region looking for odd jobs. But what appeals as a dream working location comes at a price, for the area has become notorious for assaults, robbery and rip-off merchants. Interior Minister Sar Khen has already sent a team of high-level police to Sihanoukville to investigate a spate of recent violence - including stabbings, brawls, a drive-by shooting and even explosions - in which foreigners have been victims. Reports of the attack on Mr Hay and Mr Nleml come in the wake of an extraordinary story that has emerged in Phnom Penh in recent days and which has resulted in intense discussion on the khmer440 ex-patriates’ website. The owner of the Long Beach Bungalow, Jooni Huhani Nleml, 40, from Finland, also received a blow to the head . The 27-year-old is in a serious condition at Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh after he was attacked with a machete on Thursday when a gang of men stormed the bungalow he was at . It revolves around an amazing photo of what are described as ‘two destitute Britons’ who have lost all their money and one of their passports in a hostel robbery in Sihanoukville. Martin Gates, 24,  and Nicholas Mclernan, 40, they told the Khmer Times in a story that has since been pulled that they lost $US3000 in cash, a laptop computer, two smartphones, bank cards and all their clothes apart from the ones they were wearing. They told the newspaper that they had managed to make their way to Phnom Penh to ask the British Embassy for help in getting home to the UK, but the Embassy had turned them away. Writers on the forum have questioned their story, some claiming the photo has been manipulated - which has turned out to be not the case - but asking why it appeared the colours on their T-shirts made it look as though they had taken part in a paint-gun battle. Some writers believed the pair’s story, while others said it looked like they were on drugs and were pulling a scam. The debate, which has been running for several days since the photo was first published, includes a recent post that declares that ‘anyone defending these moronic meth-heads needs their own head checked.’","Michael Hay was attacked with machete on Koh Rong island in Cambodia .

"An Oklahoma father has penned a sympathetic letter to a student who was last week caught planning a mass casualty attack on the high school that his son attends. Police became aware of the 16-year-old student after his friends alerted school authorities about worrying texts he had sent them, with a search of his home finding explosives, blueprints of explosives and plans to carry out a mass killing at Edmond North High School. Charles Martin's son, Michael, is a freshman at the school, which has 2,437 students. But rather than feel anger toward the student and his plan, Mr Martin, a writer, said he felt compassionate. He subsequently penned a letter to the boy titled 'To The Teen Who Planned To Kill My Son'. Scroll down to read the letter . Sympathetic: Charles Martin wrote a letter to a 16-year-old Edmond North High School student who was caught allegedly plotting to stage a mass killing at the school where Mr Martin's son goes . 'Instead of mourning, my son, his brother, and I are going to have a long, happy spring break,' Mr Martin wrote in the letter about his son, Michael (right) Compassionate: The letter was posted to Facebook after Mr Matin's company website crashed from all the clicks it was receiving . The letter is an attempt to understand what the teen was going through as he planned the alleged attack. It questions whether the area's harsh winter had anything to do with it, and suggests he may have never intended to actually go through with the plan. Mr Martin believes he may have wanted to get caught. 'The first thought just goes back to what it’s like being a teenager,' Mr Martin told KFOR. 'It’s a brutal, brutal time. 'Even if what he was going to do was monstrous, he is a human being. 'I hope he can find his way back to something even close to normal, that he can just survive this hole that he’s in and find something better on the other side.' Writer: Charles Martin said the first thing he thought about after hearing of the alleged plot was how 'brutal' it is to be a teenager . Scene: The 16-year-old allegedly planned to set off explosives at Edmond North High School in Oklahoma . The student is now being treated at an in-patient treatment facility. He has not been charged, but may get convicted on possession of explosives charges. He will not be returning the school. Mr Martin owns a small publishing company, and posted the letter to his website, Literati Press. It quickly went viral, causing the site to crash.

"Winston Churchill planned to tempt America into joining World War Two by offering the country a priceless copy of the Magna Carta. The British Cabinet believed the gesture would sway US public opinion in favour of joining the fighting in Europe, and even set a date for the handover before the deal fell through. Never-before-seen letters reveal the wartime government discussed how Americans are desperate for 'tangible evidence of their European background', meaning the gift would be of particular value. Letters written in 1941 reveal Churchill planned to gift the US a copy of the Magna Carta to persuade them to join World War Two, noting that Americans desire 'tangible evidence of their European background' The Magna Carta, which was issued by King John in 1215 establishing the rule of law and handing rights to his subjects, is also seen as a precursor to the American Constitution. In 1941, when the letters were written, a copy of the document was stranded in America following the outbreak of the war while it was on display at the New York World's Fair in 1939. The US government had already signed a deal sending vast amounts of aid money over to their struggling allies in Europe, but were still reticent about engaging in the fighting themselves. According to the letters, which go on display at the British Library from this Friday, the Americans saw the British as 'cold-blooded', 'calculating' people who failed 'to say it with flowers' The historic document (pictured), which signed over righta King John's people, is viewed as a precursor to the American constitution, and so was viewed as a generous gift . In an attempt to win them over, the British Cabinet, supported by Churchill, planned to gift them the copy of the Magna Carta, which belonged to Lincoln Cathedral. The letters, reported in The Independent, say: 'A friendly act, graciously performed, evokes a tremendous response; when an American has his emotions stirred, his generosity is unbounded. 'He will give the shirt off his back for friendship.' Officials even scheduled June 15 of that year as the day for the document to be handed over, but the deal fell through for unspecified reasons.

"An officer shot dead a 26-year-old man on his first day back from mandatory leave after shooting another suspect just ten days earlier. Kenosha police officer Pablo Torres returned from leave Saturday, after shooting a man who advanced on police armed with knives, the department said. On Saturday morning, police chased a car driven by 26-year-old Aaron Siler, who was wanted on a felony probation and parole warrant, Lt. Brad Hetlet said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Kenosha police officer Pablo Torres (left in an undated photo)  returned from leave Saturday, 10 days after shooting a man who advanced on police armed with knives. Right, Aaron Siler, 26, who was wanted on a felony probation and parole warrant, died from the shooting on Saturday . Siler crashed at around 9:30 a.m. and took off running. When Torres confronted Siler, Siler 'armed himself with a weapon' and Torres fatally shot him, Hetlet said. While the March 4 shooting was investigated, Torres was placed on administrative leave by department policy in police-involved shootings. He also attended annual in-service training before returning to work last weekend, police said. Torres was interviewed Tuesday by the Wisconsin Department of Justice, Hetlet told the Kenosha News. The department's Division of Criminal Investigation will lead the inquiry in the shooting of Siler. There is no timetable for Torres' return. 'He'll take as long as he needs,' Hetlet said. A car is damaged after a police chase. Police said they have no additional information to release about the shooting of Siler . 'He could possibly be off as long as it takes to complete the investigation.' Wisconsin online court records show a man with the same name and birthdate as Siler was charged in 2011 in Kenosha County with strangulation, false imprisonment, battery and disorderly conduct. He pleaded no contest to strangulation with the other charges dismissed and was sentenced in 2013 to four years of probation on condition he serve one year in jail. In 2011, the same man pleaded guilty to bail jumping and was sentenced in May 2013 to credit served for 563 days he spent in jail. A theft charge was dismissed. The Kenosha Police Department investigates the scene of a shooting, Sunday, March 15, 2015 in Kenosha . In the earlier officer-involved shooting, Torres, an 18-year veteran of the police force, was among three officers and a recruit who went to a home after a woman called to say her husband had gone into the garage to kill himself. Police say the man was armed with two knives and was seated in a running vehicle. When the man refused to drop the knives, two officers shot him with Tasers. When the man began advancing on police, Torres shot him once in the stomach. The man is expected to survive. Hetlet said police had no additional information to release about the shooting of Siler.

"Matthew Cisneros, 13, was found dead at his home in Garland, Texas, on February 26 . A 12-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of his 13-year-old friend in Garland, Texas, last month. Cops initially considered Matthew Cisneros’ death a possible suicide after responding to a 911 call on February 26. When police and paramedics arrived in the Dallas suburb they found 13-year-old Cisneros dead from an apparent gunshot wound and a gun on the ground beside him. Joe Harn with Garland Police said it wasn’t immediately certain if the shooting was self-inflicted, reports CBSDFW. A subsequent investigation revealed the victim and a 12-year-old friend had been playing with the gun inside Cisneros' home and the friend didn’t realize it was loaded when the trigger was pulled, said Harn on Monday. Detectives arrested the 12-year-old boy in connection with Cisneros' death on March 20. He now faces a manslaughter charge. His identity has not been released because he is a minor. A friend of the Cisneros family set up a GoFundMe pay to help raise funds to help pay for Matthew’s funeral. He was the eldest of single mom Laura Ciseros’ three children.

"A virus that starts off like the common cold could be responsible for leaving more than 100 children with paralysis. Last summer, more than 1,000 children and teens across the country were hospitalized with symptoms that appeared to be caused by a particularly nasty strain of enterovirus. While some of the children showed only minor symptoms of the virus - such as runny nose, sneezing and coughing - others suffered weakness of the limbs to complete paralysis . Doctors caring for the sick children  connected the illness early on to a pathogen called enterovirus  D-68. A new study published on Monday has strengthened the connection between enterovirus D68 and the sudden paralysis of more than 100 children in the last year . A new study published Monday in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases backed those initial opinions, after following the progress of 25 children in California and Colorado who experienced paralysis. Enteroviruses are a type of virus that use a single strand of RNA to replicate themselves inside the cells of mammals. Among other enteroviruses are polio, the virus that causes Hand Foot and Mouth disease along with others that cause a range of respiratory illnesses. Enterovirus D-68 is among the most recently idenfitied and was first spotted in California in 1962. It can cause mild to severe respiratory illness and is likely to be spread by inhaling virus particles when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or touches a surface. In previous years only small numbers of EV-D68 infections have been reported but that has increased during 2014, according to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. It has caused severe illness in a number of children and has even been implicated in some deaths. The incidence of infections has fallen off considerably since October but public health officials warn that infections seem to spike during the late summer and autumn. Researchers now suggest that the children were infected with a mutated form of D-68, which first appeared four years ago. B1 has five to six coding differences that make it different from other strains commonly found in the U.S., and that these differences cause nerve-damaging symptoms similar to polio. And like polio, the nerve damage appears to be permanent - since none of the children have fully recovered. 'This is starting to look more like polio unfortunately where the paralysis appears to be permanent or semi-permanent. This is why there is such an urgency for more research to investigate this' researcher Charles Chiu, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, said according to the Washington Post. However, the study has not definitely proved the connection between B1 and the paralyzed children, since researchers could not find the strain in the patients' spinal fluid. The researchers however, theorized that that was because the samples were taken too late. 'This is a virus that causes the common cold,' Chiu told NBC News. 'Parents don't bring their kids in until they are really sick. By that time, typically, the viral levels may be very, very low or undetectable.' They looked for other viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites that also could have caused the symptoms but none were present. Researchers were also not able to answer another mystery of the enterovirus - why some children only came down with minor symptoms and others lasting paralysis. Included in the study were two siblings that both came down with an 100 per cent genetically-identical strain of the virus in the past year. One of the siblings experienced  paralysis while the other only suffered upper respiratory symptoms. With enterovirus season just a few months away in late summer, researchers are saying it's extremely important that more work be done to unravel the B1 mystery and make grounds to develop a vaccine to fight the dangerous virus. The Children's Hospital Colorado continues to monitor the patients infected with enterovirus, and have even set up a special clinic for the victims.","Researchers now believe mutated strain of enterovirus D-68 caused more than 100 children to suffer sudden paralysis in the last year .
The B1 strain first popped up four years ago and has coding differences that make it similar to polio .

"The family of Conner Marshall (pictured) have paid tribute to their 'brave and protective' son. Conner died following a serious assault at a caravan park . The grieving family of teenager Conner Marshall, 18, who died following a brutal assault at a seaside caravan park have paid tribute to a 'unique and caring' son. A man from the South Wales area was arrested in Scotland yesterday after  Conner, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, died following the assault at Treco Bay caravan park in Porthcawl. Conner was found with multiple injuries in the early hours of Sunday March 8 but tragically died six days later at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. His grieving family have paid tribute to their 'unique, caring and compassionate' son. They said they were proud of Conner, who had wanted his organs to be donated. His family released a statement which said: 'We are immensely proud that Conner chose to help others in his belief that ""life goes on"" by deciding to donate his organs. 'As a family we take great comfort knowing that Conner was a unique, caring and compassionate young man with a warm, infectious smile complete with a cheeky wink. 'We draw strength in the knowledge that Conner was and is brave, protective and loved unconditionally by all of his family and friends.' Conner was a pupil at Ysgol Gyfun Bro Morgannwg in Barry until 2012 - the same school which was attended by 17-year-olds Rhodri Miller and Corey Price, who died following a crash on the A470 in Brecon on March 6. A statement on the school's website said: 'We received the news about Conner Marshall with sadness. 'We extend our sincere sympathies to his family and friends.' Police said Conner had been staying in the caravan park with friends and they spent the evening on of Saturday March 7 in bars in and around Porthcawl. The group returned to the caravan before midnigh, which is when detectives believe Conner decided to walk to the beach. A man from the South Wales area was arrested in Scotland yesterday after Conner died following the serious assault at Treco Bay caravan park in Porthcawl (pictured) following a night out with friends . Conner was rushed to hospital after being found with multiple injuries but  died six days after the attack . At 7am the following morning he was found with multiple injuries to his body with limited responsiveness. Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley said: 'We have a distinct time line of midnight to 7am on Sunday morning and I am appealing for anyone who may have seen anything during these hours to come forward. 'Conner was wearing a purple shirt, black skinny jeans, grey Adidas trainers, a blue/grey jacket and was carrying a grey Nike shoulder bag. 'Our officers are continuing to conduct inquiries to establish the full circumstances of what happened; however, we have identified a suspect and arrested a local South Wales man in Scotland.' He stressed that the suspect was not part of the group of friends staying in the caravan with Conner that evening. He said: 'Parkdean Trecco Bay Management are continuing to work closely with South Wales Police. 'Our thoughts are with Conner's family and all those affected by this tragic incident. 'This was a brutal attack and I believe the suspect may have shared information with friends, relatives or neighbours.' South Wales Police are urging anyone with any information to come forward following Conner's death .

"Depraved mothers who gave up their lives in the West to live under the rule of Islamic State terrorists in Syria are taking photographs of their newborn children sleeping alongside handguns and assault rifles in a sickening game of one-upmanship on social media. Featuring titles such as 'The Little Terrorist' and 'Generation Kilafah', the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents' extremism in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa. While some shots feature children so young that they are unlikely to be aware of the significance of the photographs, another shows a masked young girl of around three-years-old dressed in full combat gear, carrying an AK47 and raising her index figure to make a well-known jihadi gesture. 'The Little Terrorist': A newborn baby is seen sleeping under a Hello Kitty blanket. The otherwise adorable photograph is ruined by the fact an AK47 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby's bed . Exploited: A masked young girl of around three-years-old is seen dressed in full combat gear, carrying an AK47 assault rifle, and raising her index figure to make a well-known jihadi gesture . Although the images were posted on Twitter over the past year, they form part of a new study of the everyday lives and, inevitably, deaths of the young Western women who chose to live under ISIS. One photograph in the study, which was published on Buzzfeed, shows a woman calling herself Umm Abdullatif posting a photograph of a young boy aged about five dressed in military fatigues and firing a huge assault rifle. She identifies the child as her son's 'lil best mate' and suggests he has already been killed, adding that she hope her own child 'grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him'. Another photograph, this time posted by a woman calling herself Umm Usama, shows a one-year-old girl sleeping alongside a small, black pistol and is captioned 'Even my baby girl goes 2 bed with her gun #generationkhilafah'. A similar image was posted on Twitter showing a newborn baby fast asleep in a plastic crate and covered in a Hello Kitty blanket. The otherwise adorable photograph is ruined, however, by the fact an AK47 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby's bed. The image was posted on Twitter by a man claiming to be the child's father and was captioned: 'The Little Terrorist #Hammam was born in the land of the caliphate, I ask God Almighty to make him one of the Caliphate’s soldiers.' Horror: Featuring titles such as 'The Little Terrorist' and 'Generation Kilafah', the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents' extremism in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa . A woman calling herself Umm Abdullatif posting a photograph of a young boydressed in military fatigues and firing a huge assault rifle. She identifies him as her son's 'lil best mate', suggests he has already been killed, and adds that she hope her own child 'grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him' The study reveals numerous other images of young children being exploited for shocking photographs that are later posted by their twisted parents on social media. The majority show young boys and girls dressed in combat clothing and brandishing weapons and are captioned with horrific messages by their parents wishing the children a hasty death. Others show young boys and girls wearing clothing daubed in the chilling black and white ISIS logo, stating that the children are being 'raised as lions' who will one day fight against the West. The overall effect is to instill fear in the West that even if the current generation of ISIS jihadis are killed, there will still be generation after generation of bloodthirsty, brainwashed terrorists ready to fight and die in order to carry out atrocities against innocent people. The use of sickening images of gun toting children also allows the often very young militant parents to brag and boast about how 'hardcore' they are, distancing themselves from Western ideals of parenthood and encouraging them to take part in a pathetic one-upmanship on social media. Sick: This photograph shows young boys whose fathers have all been killed fighting for ISIS posing in the terror group's capital city Raqqa. The woman who posted the image said that the boys' mothers  are now raising them to be the next generation of anti-Western terrorists ready to fight and die for ISIS . Two young British women posted this photograph on Twitter saying they were living in ISIS' capital city Raqqa . The study of ISIS wives was released as an Australian jihadist widow shared a series of propaganda pictures she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen. In photographs posted to a Twitter account believed to belong to former Melbourne woman Zehra Duman, several women are pictured standing under an Islamic State flag, reclining against a clean white BMW M5, wielding machine guns and dressed from head to toe in black Islamic dress. In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?' Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.' Duman's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts. It also  featured pictures of her late reported partner, the so-called 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif, as her 'beautiful husband'. Daily Mail Australia reported in January that Duman congratulated her late partner for his death after he was reportedly killed. 'You won the race!' she tweeted, describing him as a 'green bird' - the term used to describe a so-called martyr. Life as normal: Women living under the rule of ISIS in Syria regularly post photographs of the food they are eating online and boasting that electricity in Raqqa is continuing to run . Another photograph of food posted online by ISIS militants was captioned ' Breakfast in the Islamic State' Despite the brutal treatment of men and women living under the rule of the Islamic State in Syria, thousands of Westerners have made the journey to the terrorists' de facto Syrian capital Raqqa. Yesterday it emerged that yet another young woman had fled the UK in a bid to reach ISIS. Photographed in a police cell, the 21-year-old jihadi suspect named by officials as Jaila Nadra H was arrested by Turkish security services as she waited to board a bus in Ankara. They believe the Muslim convert from East London was attempting to travel to the lawless and often porous border with Syria. The woman faces being deported back to the UK where she is likely to be arrested on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Sky News reports she is being held pending deportation hearings. One official said she was expected to be deported 'soon'. Last night her family expressed shock at her arrest.  A cousin told the Daily Mail: 'She converted to Islam several years ago and we hear little from her... Her father has recently come out of hospital where he was undergoing chemotherapy. It is hard to believe this could happen.' Turkish officials said authorities apprehended the woman based on local intelligence and were not tipped off by British authorities. Five star jihad: The ISIS wives study emerged as a Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5 . Alarming: Zehra Duman posted this photograph to social media with the caption: '5 star jihad. M5 (the BMW) in the land of sham (Syria) he he ' Turkish authorities are holding a 21-year-old British woman named by officials as Jaila Nadra H (pictured) on suspicion of trying to travel to Syria and into Islamic State territory to join the terror group . The arrest comes days after three British teenagers were arrested at the airport in the Turkish city of Istanbul and thrown out of the country. The young men, two aged 17 and a third aged 19, were questioned by counter-terrorism police on their return to the UK and released on bail. They have told their families they wanted to go to Syria to 'help', and denied subscribing to the beliefs of militant Islamists. Last month three British girls – Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15 – travelled to Turkey. They were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, a close friend, who travelled to Syria last December. There are increasing concerns about the growing numbers of young people being lured to the warzone in Syria and Iraq. Last week David Cameron said everyone has a responsibility to examine why people should want to join Islamic State. Turkey is an important ally to the West as European states attempt to stem the flow of foreign fighters bolstering the ranks of Islamic State. It has been criticised for allowing fighters to cross the border into Syria but in return has asked why other countries allow militants to travel in the first place.","Depraved terrorists use social media to share photos of gun-toting children .

"Hewn into a hillside, this is the humble stone and mortar house where a scholar believes Jesus was raised. It has been dated to the early 1st century by a British archaeologist who says an ancient text points to the building as being the home in Nazareth where Mary and Joseph brought up the son of God. Professor Ken Dark says De Locis Sanctis, written in 670 by Irish monk Adomnan, described the house as located between two tombs and below a church. A British archaeologist has identified what he believes could have been the house (exterior pictured) where Jesus was raised. Dr Ken Dark said that the humble first century home in Nazareth, Northern Israel, could have been where Mary and Joseph brought up the son of God . In the first century, two tombs were built beside what is believed to be Jesus' home. The forecourt of the tomb seen here passes through the abandoned home. Dr Ken Dark describes it as having been cut out of a limestone hillside and having a series of rooms and a stairway . The text was based on a pilgrimage to Nazareth made by the Frankish bishop Arculf and tells of a church ‘where once there was the house in which the Lord was nourished in his infancy’. In the Byzantine era, and again in the 12th century at the time of the Crusades, the ruins of the building were incorporated into churches – suggesting it was of great significance and needed to be protected, the Reading University archaeologist argues. The house was cut into a limestone hillside and has a series of rooms and a stairway. One of the original doorways has survived, as has part of the original chalk floor. The key piece of evidence linking the site to Jesus is pilgrim text called 'De Locus Sanctis' written in 670 AD by abbot Adomnàn of Iona (pictured) It was supposedly based on a pilgrimage made to Nazareth and talks about a church 'where once there was the house in which the Lord was nourished in his infancy' The Sisters of Nazareth Convent matches this because there is evidence of a large Byzantine church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt, Dr Dark writes.The house he believes was Jesus' boyhood home stands in between the two tombs which also matches with Adomnàn's account . Writing in the journal Biblical Archaeological Review, Dr Dark says that while he has no proof, there is ‘no good reason’ to believe it was not Jesus’s home. He has been researching the ruins, in what is now northern Israel, since 2006. The house was first identified as significant in the 1880s after the chance discovery of by nuns an ancient cistern. An excavation was ordered. Jesuit priest Henri Senes carried out more work in 1936. Since 2006, Dr Dark’s team has discovered broken cooking pots, a spindle whorl and limestone artefacts. The limestone items suggest a Jewish family lived there as Jews believed that limestone could not be impure – and Mary and Joseph were living in Nazareth when the angel Gabriel revealed that Mary would give birth to the son of God, a baby to be named Jesus. The house is thought to be located beneath the Sisters of Nazareth Convent which is across the road from Church of Annunciation in Nazareth. The key piece of evidence linking the site to Jesus is pilgrim text called 'De Locus Sanctis' written in 670 AD by abbot Adomnàn of Iona. It was supposedly based on a pilgrimage made to Nazareth made by the Frankish bishop Arculf and talks about a church 'where once there was the house in which the Lord was nourished in his infancy.' He writes: 'The other stood nearby and was built near a vault that also contained a spring and the remains of two tombs. 'Between these two tombs was the house in which Jesus was raised. From this is derived the more recent name for the church that Adomnàn described'. The Sisters of Nazareth Convent matches this because there is evidence of a large Byzantine church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt, Dr Dark writes. The house is thought to be located beneath the Sisters of Nazareth Convent which is across the road from Church of Annunciation in Nazareth . The last attempt to identify the house where Jesus grew up was in 2009 when archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority found another 1st century home they believed had been occupied by a Jewish family. Pictured an Israeli Antiquities Authority worker clears debris during the 2009 excavation . Dr Dark, a specialist in first century and Christian archaeology, argues that the house he believes was Jesus’s boyhood home matches Adomnan’s account. It is located beneath the Sisters of Nazareth Convent, which is across the road from Church of Annunciation in Nazareth. Artefacts at the site included broken cooking pots, a spindle whorl and limestone artifacts. The limestone items suggest a Jewish family lived there as Jews believed that limestone could not be impure. The house has been cut out of a limestone hillside and having a series of rooms and a stairway. One of the original doorways has survived as has part of the original chalk floor. The house is located beneath the Sisters of Nazareth Convent which is across the road from Church of Annunciation in Nazareth. Subsequent generations after the first century took great care to look after the site. The house was decorated with mosaics in the Byzantine period, suggesting that they were of special importance. The Adomnan text describes two churches in Nazareth, one of which was the Church of Annunciation. Dr Dark writes: ‘The other stood nearby and was built near a vault that also contained a spring and the remains of two tombs.’ The Sisters of Nazareth Convent matches this because there is evidence of a large Byzantine church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt, he says. Dr Dark writes: ‘Great efforts had been made to encompass the remains of this building. Both the tombs and the house were decorated with mosaics in the Byzantine period, suggesting that they were of special importance, and possibly venerated. ‘Was this the house where Jesus grew up? It is impossible to say on archaeological grounds. 'On the other hand, there is no good archaeological reason why such an identification should be discounted.’ In 2009 archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority found another 1st century home nearby they believed had been occupied by a Jewish family. However they were able to say only that Jesus may have lived near the site. Along with the home, a number of water sources have also been found at Nazareth. They would have been accessed with Jesus was alive. This image shows a famous source known today as 'Mary's Spring' The house is located near the Basilica of the Annunciation (pictured). Overall the design was typical of early Roman settlements in the Galilee .","Clues found in 'De Locus Sanctis' written in 670 AD by abbot Adomnàn .

"The harsh winter has authorities in a Michigan village using explosives to break up dangerously thick river ice for the second year running. Michigan state officials were called in to the village of Sebewaing on Thursday to clear the ice with explosive charges to prevent the blocked river from flooding. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and other agencies conducted the operation to clear the Sebewaing River. Authorities in the Michigan village of Sebewaing are using explosives to break up dangerously thick river ice for the second year running . The ice has reached 23 inches thick on places and poses a flood risk, so officials decided to try and clear the ice between the village and the mouth of the Sebewaing River where it flows into Saginaw Bay . The village of Sebewaing is 95 miles north of Detroit in the area known as the 'thumb' of Michigan, due to the shape of the state often being referred to as looking like a glove or a hand. The plan was to break up the ice from the North Center Street Bridge to the mouth of the river, where it flows into Saginaw Bay - a distance of approximately 3,000 feet. Explosives were used during last year's  harsh winter to break up the river ice for the first time since early 2001. The thickness of the ice in 2014 was 24 inches, and officials say that this year the ice has already reached 23 inches thick.

"The man who has been charged with murdering a pregnant Food Network star and her husband was a key suspect in the disappearance of a teenage boy 15 years ago, it has been revealed. Robert Jason Owens, 36, a construction worker from North Carolina, was booked on two counts of first-degree murder, the murder of an unborn child, larceny and breaking and entering on Tuesday. His charges are in relation to the supposed murder of his Leicester neighbors, celebrity chef Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, a season 8 finalist on Food Network Star, and her  husband Joseph Codd, 45. The couple, whose bodies have not been found, were likely killed on Thursday, according to police. Owens allegedly returned to their home on Sunday and stole their laptop, jewelry and a handgun. Now, it has emerged that Owens was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of Zebb Quinn, 18, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Linked: Robert Jason Owens, 36, who has been charged with murdering a pregnant Food Network star and her husband, was a key suspect in the disappearance of Zebb Quinn (pictured) 15 years ago, it has emerged . Suspect: Sheriff Van Duncan said Owens (pictured) was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of 18-year-old Quinn, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21 . Believed dead: Owens has been charged with the murder of his Leicester neighbors, celebrity chef Cristie Schoen Codd (left), 38, a season 8 finalist on Food Network Star, and her husband Joseph Codd (right), 45 . Quinn, who has not been seen since the night of January 2 that year, was captured on surveillance video buying sodas with Owens at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. The pair then drove away separately. But they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a Mitsubishi Eclipse for sale that Quinn was interested in buying, police told Fox Carolina. Owens later told police that a short while later, Quinn flashed his headlights at him and the two pulled over. Quinn then went off to return a page, before returning in a 'frantic' state, Owens said. Cancelling the pair's plans to see the Mitsubishi, Quinn reportedly told Owens he needed to leave and drove off, bumping into his friend's truck on his way. Since that moment, he has been missing. On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis, filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, which was situated at The Little Pigs Barbecue near a hospital where Vlahakis worked. A pair of lips were also drawn on the car's back windshield. Unanswered questions: Quinn (left), who has not been seen since the night of January 2, 2000, was captured on video buying sodas with Owens (right, in his mug shot in the Codds' murder case) at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. Later that night, the teenager drove off and has not been seen since . Work: Quinn, a Roberson High School graduate, had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. He also enjoyed his work at this Walmart (pictured), his family said at the time . Mother: On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis (pictured), filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, while a pair of lips were drawn on the car's back windshield . It remains unknown who the Labrador-mix puppy - which was around three months old - belonged to. It was later adopted by a police officer, according to The Charley Project cold cases website. In February, police were authorized to take hair, blood and saliva samples from Owens in relation to the disappearance of Quinn, whom his family said would not have gone away of his own accord. Although they never acquired evidence to warrant charges against Owens, Sheriff Van Duncan told The Citizen-Times in Asheville Owens 'was definitely a primary suspect in the Zebb Quinn case'. Vlahakis later said of her son: 'We all feel very certain that he was killed that night', explaining how he had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. Speaking to Fox Carolina, the grief-stricken mother added: 'It is hard because we don't know and it's hard because we can't say goodbye and kind of put everything at rest.'

They were both set to leave for work on Sunday - but never made it . Scene: Authorities (pictured at the scene) believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun' In 2012, Quinn's disappearance was featured on the Investigation Discovery Channel show,  'Disappeared', which covered various theories relating to the baffling cold case. One theory revolved around a woman whom Quinn was apparently romantically interested in. The woman, Misty, reportedly had an abusive boyfriend who had made threats toward the teenager. However, Misty and her partner were questioned by police at the time and no arrests were made. Authorities have said said they believe more than one person may have been involved in Quinn’s disappearance and presumed murder.

Mrs Codd, who grew up in Mississippi,was five months' pregnant with their first child at the time. The Codds' cars and two dogs were found at their home. James Fisher, a member of a local band that played the Codds' wedding last September, said the pair were a 'beautiful couple'. Speaking of Mr Codd, the musician told the Citizen-Times of Mr Codd: 'I know he believed in giving people second chances, and he'd hired people out there who'd been in prison.' It remains unclear what Owens' motive was behind the alleged murder. Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams said he has not yet decided if he will ask for the death penalty in the case. Owens, who is being held without bail, appeared in court on Tuesday, where he requested an attorney, ABC News 13 reported.

"Dozens of angry protesters have descended on the wealthy Dallas neighborhood where racist Oklahoma frat boy Parker Rice lives - hoping to shame his parents for their son's participation in the horrific racist chant that shocked the nation. Rice, a former Sigma Alpha Epsilon brother at University of Oklahoma, and his parents Bob and Jan say they have been forced to flee their $650,000 home in the elite suburb of Preston Hollow - home to the likes of George W. Bush, Mark Cuban and Ross Perot. Neighbors looked on in dismay as about two dozen protesters marched up the street on Wednesday night, shouting, 'racism is taught' and 'Teach your kids another way. No modern-day KKK.' On Tuesday, 19-year-old Rice was first identified by Daily Mail Online as one of the leaders of the racist chant 'there will never be a n***** SAE' that was filmed on a chartered bus full of members of the fraternity.  . Scroll down for video . A group staginged a peaceful protest outside the childhood home of University of Oklahoma student Parker Rice in Dallas, Texas . Charletteria Mathis, second from left, Albeta Wellington, far right, and her son Mark Wallace, 5, protested outside the home of Rice's parents in the exclusive Dallas neighborhood of Preston Hollow . Neighbors looked on in dismay as protesters rallied down the street of three-quarter-milling dollar ranch homes in Preston Hallow on Wednesday night . The Rices have been forced to flee their $650,000 ranch home in North Dallas after receiving threatening calls and death threats online, they said . The other SAE brother identified in the racist chant video is Levi Pettit, who grew up in this six-bedroom, 7,500-square-foot home, which is valued at $4.1million in the Dallas suburb of Highland Park . The other SAE brother pictured prominently in the shocking video is Levi Pettit, who grew up in a $4.1million mansion in the wealthy Dallas suburb of Highland Park, Texas. Protesters from the Dallas-area group Next Generation Action Network staged the protest, hoping to call attention to the rarefied Texas upbringings they they say fostered the racism seen on the SAE video. 'I know that he was only taught this. So, that means going to his parents, the environment that he was raised in that taught him this,' protest leader Dominque Alexander told WFAA-TV. The protesters remained peaceful as they marched in Preston Hollow, though several Dallas police officers stood guard outside the Rice home. At one point, a masked woman shouted at one of the officers, who is black: 'You are a brother! They talk about killing you and you're standing on his property? How can you do that? You're a brother,' according to WFAA. When Rice issued an apology to the Dallas Morning News on Tuesday night, he revealed that he and his family have been getting threats and were forced to flee their home. 'Sadly, at this moment our family is not able to be in our home because of threatening calls as well as frightening talk on social media,' he said. Parker Rice, a University of Oklahoma freshman from Dallas, has been identified as the conductor leading the 'there will never be a n***** in SEA' chant on Saturday . Outed: Levi Pettit was identified by his family on Tuesday night. They apologized for his 'disgusting' behavior. Right, Pettit - an accomplished golfer at his former school Highland Park - is pictured putting in a 2013 photo . Some of the protesters shouted at neighbors, who had gathered on their expansive front lawns to watch the commotion. Neighbor Mike Grimm told the Dallas Morning News that the protesters shouldn't make assumptions about Preston Hollow because of the actions of one resident. 'To say the whole neighborhood is racist is painting with a broad brush. Everyone is a little sickened about what’s happened,' he said. Preston Hollow is one of the wealthiest parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Average home value in the community is $1.7million and several billionaires and bold-face names call the neighborhood home. Former President George W. Bush and wife Laura settled there after he left office. Billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner and reality star Mark Cuban lives in the area, along with billionaire former presidential candidate Ross Perot. Natural gas magnate T. Boone Pickens and retired Dallas Stars player Mike Modano also call it home, according to Dallas Magazine. Protest leader Dominique Alexander said he wanted to call attention to the wealthy upbringing of Parker Rice that resulted in him leading the racist chant at University of Oklahoma . That protesters numbered about two dozen and remained peaceful - even as police stood guard outside the Rice home . Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, who attended the same high school as Rice, Jesuit High School, also spoke out about the incident on Wednesday. 'I am embarrassed for the actions of one of the alumni and those things happen,' said Rawlings, who sits on the board of directors at Jesuit. 'It's not acceptable, it's disappointing but Jesuit is a great, great high school.' In his apology, Rice said; 'I am deeply sorry for what I did Saturday night. It was wrong and reckless.' The young man then went on to blame alcohol as a contributing factor, while also saying he learned the song from other fraternity members.","A group is staging a peaceful protest outside the childhood home of University of Oklahoma student Parker Rice in Dallas, Texas .

"Pope Francis has had lunch with at least 10 gay, transgender and HIV-suffering inmates at a prison in Naples today, it has been reported. They were among 90 prisoners invited to dine with the pontiff on his day-long trip to southern-Italy. The stop-off at the Giuseppe Salvia Detention Centre in Poggioreale was not originally on his schedule, according to Italian TV station TV 2000. But the Pope reportedly insisted on the meal which was prepared by the prisoners themselves. Scroll down for video . Breaking bread: Pope Francis (pictured) has had lunch with at least 10 gay, transgender and HIV-suffering inmates at a prison in Naples during his visit to the city . Holy visit: The prison visit was not originally on his schedule but the pontiff insisted on the meal which was prepared by the inmates . Adoration: Thousands of people turned out to cheer the Pope on his day-long visit to Naples where he will hold a number of events before returning to the Vatican tonight . Lucky few: The 90 prisoners who dined with the Pope were selected by lottery from about 1,900 others at the Giuseppe Salvia Detention Centre (pictured) The inmates who dined with the pope were chosen by lottery from around 1,900, the Vatican Insider website has reported. And it was a very simple and 'frugal' because the Pope wants to take the time to get to know every prisoner personally, the head of a prison ministry told Vatican Radio. The prison visit formed part of a very busy day for Pope Francis in the Italian city that lies 150 miles south of Rome. Francis began praying at a sanctuary in Pompeii, before holding a string of events which include an outdoor mass and meetings with young people and the sick before heading back to the Vatican this evening. Since his election two years ago, the Argentine pontiff has led a new and welcoming approach to gay and transgender people. When asked whether a gay man could be a priest, he reportedly replied: 'Who am I to judge?' And in late January, he had a private meeting in the Vatican with a Spanish transgender man who wrote to Francs about the rejection he was facing at his home parish. On Holy Thursday next month, he will wash the feet of male and female inmates at a prison near Rome as part of his continued public outreach to detainees.

Support: People stood on their terraces to watch the Pope speak and hung a banner which read: 'Dignity can't be evicted' Divine: On Holy Thursday next month, he will wash the feet of male and female inmates at a prison near Rome as part of his continued public outreach to detainees . Before the lunch, Pope Francis called on members of organised crime to turn away from the violence to 'stop the tears of the mothers of Naples' in one of the city's most violent areas. He was speaking in the shadow of a housing project known as Le Vele which is considered so dangerous that even the police are sometimes afraid to enter. The blighted area has been a battleground for 'Camorra' clans fighting each other for control of drug trafficking and extortion rackets. He urged the locals not to let criminals rob them of their hope and also said members of organised crime excommunicate themselves from the Church - but it would welcome them back if they repent.","Ten gay, transgender inmates were among the 90 eating with Pope Francis .

"Photographs of rainbow lorikeets who usually feed on seeds eating meat has puzzled bird experts. A series of pictures snapped at a Elimbah home - north of Brisbane - owned by a man only known as Bill shows the Australian icons feasting on mince, the ABC reported. Griffith University's Darryl Jones has been studying bird for about 20 years, taking a particular interest in bird feeding, and says he has never seen a phenomena like this before. This photo of lorikeets eating mince meat was snapped in Elimbah - north of Brisbane in Queensland . 'I've not ever heard of lorikeets, who are seed eating birds, eat meats,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'What on earth are lorikeets eating meats for? 'It's not unusual for animals to eat bad food, humans do that every single day - we eat fat and sugars. 'I can't imagine it could be good for them. I don't recommend people feeding them meat.' Professor Jones shed some light on why he thought lorikeets had taken a carnivorous turn. He said they must have acquired a taste for proteins when people put out food for other birds. Griffith University Professor Darryl Jones has expressed shock at seeing these seed-eating birds chow down on meat . 'Although you really shouldn't feed birds, there are a huge number of people who do anyway,' Prof Jones told Daily Mail Australia. 'Magpies, butcher birds and kookaburras are meat eating birds and people put out chopped up sausage and ham for them.' Since expressing his views on the photos, Prof Jones said he had been inundated by emails from people claiming it was more common than he had thought. Lorikeets are normally birds that favour a diet of seeds. Prof Jones does not recommend feeding them meat . 'I've had 188 emails coming in, saying it happens... so it's not as rare as what I was thinking,' he said. Wildlife carer Fran Sanders - who has been taking in animals for 25 years in Brisbane - told the ABC she had also never seen this kind of behaviour from lorikeets. 'I'm absolutely amazed and horrified,' she said. 'I've never heard any of them [people she had helped] talk about lorikeets coming down and eating mince.'","Pictures show rainbow lorikeets eating meat near Brisbane, Queensland .

"Dozens of homeless people have been treated to a private viewing of the Sistine Chapel, complete with a surprise appearance by Pope Francis himself, in the pontiff's latest gesture towards the most vulnerable people in society. Normally one of the hottest tourist tickets in town, the home of Michelangelo's celebrated ceiling frescoes closed its doors early to regular visitors to enable the group of around 150 street-sleepers to be shown around the chapel and adjoining Vatican museums and gardens. In an unannounced visit, it was the pope himself who welcomed the group to the Sistine Chapel, taking the time to greet each of the visitors.

He requested that no pictures were taken of him doing so . 'This is a house for everyone, this is your home. The doors are always open to all,' the Argentinian pope told them. 'Pray for me, I need the prayers of people like you,' he added. The pontiff had asked that there be no pictures of the meeting. It was the latest in a string of highly symbolic initiatives sanctioned by Francis, who has made a focus on the plight of the homeless and other marginalised groups one of the defining themes of his papacy. Last month a homeless man who died on the streets around St Peter's Square was buried in an exclusive cemetery within the Vatican that is usually reserved for senior German clerics. The pope, who says he wants 'a poor Church, for the poor,' has also had showers for the homeless installed in public toilets just off St Peter's square.

The families of hostages David Haines and Alan Henning who were murdered by the Islamic extremist Jihadi John have been blessed by the Pope. Aid worker David Haines, of Yorkshire, was beheaded last September after being captured by Islamic state. Alan Henning, 47, a father-of-two, was killed in the same way a month later. On Wednesday, Pope Francis met the families of the two men at a service aimed at uniting religions and ending extremism. Widow Barbara Henning was brought up to meet the Pope on the steps of St Peter's Basilica in Rome. Usually such access is reserved for visiting prelates. Michael Haines, brother of David Haines, was also able to meet the Pope at the ceremony. To mark his 78th birthday in December, Pope Francis ordered the distribution of sleeping bags across Rome and some homeless people have been recruited to hand out copies of the gospels to the faithful attending Sunday audiences at St Peter's. This morning it emerged that Francis will become the first pontiff to address the US Congress after accepting an invitation to visit the White House. US President Barack Obama will host the Pope on September 23, after extending an invitation during talks at the Vatican last year. The White House said the president and the pope will continue a dialogue about poverty, the environment, immigration and promoting religious freedom. 'The president looks forward to continuing this conversation with the Holy Father during his first visit to the United States as pope,' a statement said.","Dozens of homeless people were given a guided tour of the Sistine Chapel .

"If has come under fire from critics as a useless gadget, but Apple's Tim Cook has revealed he is confident the Apple Watch will become as much of a success as the firms other written-off products - the iPhone and the iPad. He claimed the Apple Watch, which goes on sale in April, with prices starting at $349, has already become a part of his life. He also claimed it will be 'the first smartwatch that matters'. Scroll down for video . Tim Cook pledged the Apple Watch 'will be the first modern smartwatch—the first one that matters.' When asked why many people seem to have a hard time imagining the usefulness of the watch, he told Fast Company: 'People didn't realize they had to have an iPod, and they really didn't realize they had to have the iPhone. And the iPad was totally panned. 'Critics asked, 'Why do you need this?' 'Honestly, I don't think anything revolutionary that we have done was predicted to be a hit when released. 'It was only in retrospect that people could see its value. 'Maybe this will be received the same way. Cook also hit out at Microsoft, and Google's Android software, saying collaboration was the key to Apple's success. 'Without collaboration, you get a Windows product. 'There’s a company that pumps out an operating system, another that does some hardware, and yet another that does something else. That’s what’s now happening in Android land. 'Put it all together and it doesn’t score high on the user experience.' Cook claims the firm has not set ambitious sales targets for the Watch, as it did for the iPhone. He also revealed the thinking before the firm's decision to wait until its product was right - despite huge numbers of rumours and excitement around the product. 'We weren't first on the MP3 player; we weren't first on the tablet; we weren't first on the smartphone. But we were arguably the first modern smartphone, and we will be the first modern smartwatch—the first one that matters.' Cook also claims the firm has not set ambitious sales targets for the Watch, as it did for the iPhone. 'On the watch we haven't set a number. The watch needs the iPhone 5, 6, or 6 Plus to work, which creates a ceiling. But I think it's going to do well. I'm excited about it. 'I've been using it every day and I don't want to be without it. Cook also revealed that the firm has left Steve job office untouched since he died - and couldn't decide what to do when the firm moves into its new 'spaceship' campus next year. 'I haven’t decided about what we’ll do there. 'But I wanted to keep his office exactly like it was. I was in there with Laurene [Powell Jobs, Steve’s wife] the other day because there are still drawings on the board from the kids. 'I took Eve [Steve’s daughter] in there over the summer and she saw some things that she had drawn on his white board years earlier.' 'His computer is still in there as it was, his desk is still in there as it was, he’s got a bunch of books in there.' Tim Cook previously revealed that Steve Jobs once phoned his mother because he was concerned about how hard he was working. In a new book about the Apple co-founder, Cook also reveals the moment Jobs asked him to take over as CEO - just weeks before his death. The book, Becoming Steve Jobs, a new biography by technology reporter Brent Schlender and Fast Company executive editor Rick Tetzeli, was given . In a recent interview Cook revealed his average working day - which still leaves little time for socialising. He gets up at 3:45am every morning and begins to check his email, goes to the gym at 5am and to work at 6:30am, already fully briefed and with the day ahead planned out. He goes to bed early: by 9:30pm or sometimes 10pm. 'The Steve I knew was the guy pestering me to have a social life, not because he was being a pest, but because he knew how important family was in his life, and he wanted it for me, too,' said Cook in the book, an extract of which was published by FastCompany.. 'One day he calls my mom—he doesn't even know my mom, she lives in Alabama. 'He said he was looking for me, but he knows how to find me! 'He talked to her about me. There are lots of these things where you saw the very soft or caring or feeling or whatever you want to call it side of him. He had that gene. 'Someone who's viewing life only as a transactional relationship with people...doesn't do that.' In a recent interview Cooks revealed his average working day - which still leaves little time for socialising. The books also reveals Jobs worked for as long as possible. 'He was working his ass off till the end, in pain,' remembers Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of software and internet services. 'You could see it in the meetings; he was taking morphine and you could see he was in pain, but he was still interested.' Previously it was revealed Cook once tried to offer Steve Jobs his liver in a desperate bid to prolong his life. Jobs had been suffering serious health problems as a result of his pancreatic cancer and by January 2009 - two years before his death - was in urgent need of a liver transplant. On learning this, Cook was so upset he took it upon himself to have his blood tested and found that he happened to have the same rare blood type as his good friend and mentor. Steve Jobs posing with an Apple II computer. 1976 Jobs co-founds Apple . 1980 Apple's stock market flotation is biggest since Ford in 1956 . 1985 Leaves Apple to concentrate on new ventures, including Pixar and NeXT . 1997 Returns to Apple promising to revitalise the flagging company . 2000 Resumes as Apple CEO . 2002 iPod launched . 2003 iTunes launched .

Because it is a regenerative organ, the transplanted portion will grow to a functioning size, while the donor's liver would also repair. Bouyed by the findings, Cook visited Jobs at his home in Palo Alto to relay the good news. But Jobs outright refused. 'He cut me off at the legs, almost before the words were out of my mouth,' said Cook in the biography, according to Fast Company. ''No,' he said. 'I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that'. Somebody that's selfish doesn't reply like that. 'I mean, here's a guy, he's dying, he's very close to death because of his liver issue and here's someone healthy offering a way out.' The new biography (pictured right) about Steve Jobs (left) is due to be released later this month . Cook insisted that he was 'perfectly healthy' and stressed that the procedure would not put him at risk. But Jobs 'popped up in bed' and told him: 'No, I'm not doing that.' Cook said Jobs had very rarely ever shouted at him during the 13 years they had known each other, but 'this was one of them.' Even though he was gravely ill, the tech guru worked on Apple on the last very last day of his life, phoning colleagues from the confines of his bed with new ideas. He died at his home on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.","Cook pledged Apple Watch will be the 'first  smartwatch that matters'

"The four officers who rescued an 18-month-old toddler from the wreck of a submerged car on Sunday said they launched into their heroics when they heard desperate pleas for help coming from a  woman inside. But when the four men used all their strength to right the red Dodge sedan, they found little Lily Groesbeck to be the only passenger left alive in the vehicle. Her mother, 25-year-old Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, had passed away the night before when she lost control of the car and could not possibly have called for the men to help save her child. 'For two nights I've laid awake trying to figure out exactly what it could be. All I know is it was there, we all heard it,' Spanish Fork Police Officer Tyler Beddoes said. 'It was extra motivation.' Scroll down for video . Lone survivor: 25-year-old Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck (left) and her 18-month-old daughter, Lily (right), were found inside a crashed car in Utah's Spanish Fork river on Saturday. Groesbeck pictured above in a photo posted to Facebook . Spanish Fork Police Officers Tyler Beddoes, left, and Jared Warner, right, and Spanish Fork City Firefighters Lee Mecham, second from left, and Paul Tomadakis, second from right, answered questions Monday night regarding be the first responders on scene . Submerged: The temperature in the river was near freezing throughout the night after the car hit the river. Water flowed into the car through broken windows and rushed just below Lily's head . Tragic: Groesbeck died in the crash, but her baby, Lily, survived, is in stable condition and is improving. She is opening her eyes and doing well, police said . Beddoes said that he and the other three on scene responded to the voice calling for help when they approached the car. All four officers said they were there to help. But when they flipped the car, the mother was already deceased and Lily was unconscious, he said. A firefighter jumped into the river and cut the straps, freeing the blond baby girl who was wearing only a flannel onesie and no hat or gloves. Officers formed a line in the river and handed the cold girl to one another until she was on the shoreline and in emergency workers' arms. They rushed her to an ambulance and performed CPR, Beddoes said Monday, two days after the crash. Lily is in stable condition and improving, according to hospital officials. Beddoes, who spoke with the family, said the baby is opening her eyes and doing well. 'Her improvement is astounding. Right now she's watching 'Dora (the Explorer)' and singing '(The) Wheels on the Bus' with Grandpa. She is smiling and laughing for family members. We're blown away by Lily's progress and so grateful to her rescuers,' Lily's family said, according to CNN. Nobody knows exactly how the infant survived hanging upside down for nearly 14 hours in her car seat with no food or water. As she dangled, icy water rushed just below her head through broken car windows as the Dodge Caliber sat perched on the bank and rocks. The temperatures were near freezing throughout the night and through the morning. 'It's heartbreaking. Was she crying most the night?' said Beddoes, a 30-year-old father of two. 'It's a miracle... She was needed for sure elsewhere.' Car crash: Police believe that Lynn Groesbeck struck a cement barrier on a bridge before landing in the river upside down on Friday . Devastating: A fisherman found car the next day, partially submerged in the river. Groesbeck was found dead in driver's seat of vehicle, while her baby girl was alive in the back seat, above the frigid river waters . And that voice? Beddoes said he and the three officers talked later and concurred they all heard the same thing. They can't explain it, but have no doubt they heard it. 'That's the part that really sends me for a whirl,' Beddoes said. 'I'm not really religious, but that's what you think of.' Police believe the accident occurred when the baby's mother, Lynn Groesbeck, struck a cement barrier on a bridge and careened into the river late Friday in Spanish Fork, about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City. She was driving to her home in Springville after visiting her parents in Salem, Spanish Fork police Lt. Matt Johnson said. A fisherman found the crashed car upside down in the river on Saturday at 12.30pm, about 14 hours after the accident occurred around 10.30pm on Friday. A neighbor in the area reported hearing a loud noise near the bridge Friday night at about 11pm, but couldn't locate the cause of the sound after checking the area near Provo. Investigators don't know what caused the crash, he said. There were no skid marks or signs of mechanical failures in the car. Rescue mission: When Lily was retreived from the car, police officers handed the cold girl to one another until she reached the shore and emergency workers could rush her to the hospital . Aspiring dreams: Jill Sanderson, Lynn's sister, said Groesbeck was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life . Night drive: Police said that Lynn Groesbeck was driving home from her parents' house in Salem on Friday when the accident occurred . Unknown cause: Investigators are still unsure as to what caused the crash. There were no skid marks on the road and no signs of mechanical errors in the car . Police don't suspect drugs or alcohol as a factor but are awaiting toxicology test results. Maybe Lynn Groesbeck was tired or distracted, Johnson said, adding authorities weren't ruling anything out. The child was first taken to Mountain View Hospital and then flown to Primary Children's Hospital in critical condition. 'She is doing remarkably well considering the circumstance. The doctors have been hopeful so far,' said Lynn's sister, Jill Sanderson on Sunday. 'We would like to express our appreciation to the Spanish Fork rescue team for saving the baby's life.' Sanderson said her sister was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life, according to KSL. Grosebeck was also the youngest of five children, including three brothers and her sister. 'She was very compassionate and a very loving person and always willing to bend over backwards for her loved ones,' said Sanderson. 'Her baby was the love of her life. She was an amazing mother.' Mystery: A neighbor reported hearing a loud noise on Friday just after the car crash, but when they checked the area around Provo, no cause of sound could be located . Frigid: The waters of the river, just 50 miles outside Salt Lake City were near freezing. Multiple emergency responders were treated for hypothermia . Obstruction: Police said the car likely sat in the river for so long because the scene of the accident shielded by cement barriers on the side of the road . Groesbeck was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, her sister Jill Sanderson told the Deseret News. Even though the road that goes over the bridge gets plenty of traffic, no one saw the wreck because the cement barrier obstructed the view of below, Johnson said. If the fisherman didn't choose that river that morning, it could have been several more hours, he said. Sanderson wasn't available for comment Monday but she told the Deseret News newspaper and KSL-TV of Salt Lake City on Sunday that Lily is doing remarkably well considering what happened. Beddoes said the family has thanked him and the other officers for helping to save little Lily. As he recalls the events of those chaotic moments, on a frigid but sunny day, Beddoes still can't believe the girl survived — and still can't make sense of that undeniable voice coming from the car. 'We all got together and we all heard the same type of thing,' Beddoes said. 'We just can't grasp what we were hearing.' Family: Groesbeck's sister Jill Sanderson said that Lily is doing remarkably well and she thanks all of the officers who saved the baby .","Lynn Groesbeck, 25, was driving home from her parents' house Friday night when she veered off roadway and into Spanish Fork River .

"A £4million house in one of the country's wealthiest areas is to be demolished - to make way for three properties worth three times as much. Sandbanks in Poole, Dorset, has long been one of the most exclusive addresses in Britain with the super rich fighting over coveted space on its water's edge. With wealthy footballers and businessmen vying for a spot on the small peninsula, house hunters have been known to snap up dated, old-fashioned properties to knock down and rebuild. The 1980s house is no different, with developers keen to make the most of its 3.5 acre plot. The property in Sandbanks in Poole, Dorset, is to be demolished and replaced with three other modern houses worth a combined £12million . The property, which lies in one of the country's most exclusive postcodes, no longer has 'architectural merit' after lying derelict for so long . The house's empty indoor swimming pool is filled with debris and leaves. Each of the new houses will have its own pool and four bedrooms . Local groups expressed no desire to maintain the original property which, if left untouched any longer, would have become entirely ruined . Debris and scattered roof tiles now fill the house's empty swimming pool. The house was bought for £4million by property developers . The property previously boasted manicured lawns and an impressive fountain in the centre of its driveway. It is pictured before workers began tearing it down . Work has already begun in tearing down the house which has five bedrooms, four bathrooms, four reception rooms and an indoor swimming pool. Having been left derelict for years it is now filled with rubble and debris and no longer has 'architectural merit', said the estate agents involved in its sale. Adrian Dunford, of Tailor Made Estate Agents, said: 'The large detached property that is there now has got no architectural merit. It isn’t a particularly pretty property at all and the way its sits on the plot isn’t ideal. 'There has been no appetite among local conservation groups such as the Sandbanks Association for it to be given listed status.' The 3.5 acre plot borders a nature reserve and will be divided up to make way for the three contemporary homes worth  £4.8m, £4m and £3.25m. Gardeners will uproot 50 trees as part of the plan, but plant 40 saplings in their place. All of the new flat-roofed properties will have four bedrooms and two will be split over three levels and have indoor swimming pools. Its current layout has been a waste of space, said developers who are eager to capitalise on its vast gardens. 'It is almost a four acre site and there is no reason to have just one house on it,' added Mr Dunford. 'Couples in this area don’t require a house of 30,000 square foot where they will be in separate parts of it most of the time and only see each other at dinner. 'One of the main attractions of this area is the outdoor lifestyle it offers and couples prefer to do that together. An artist's impression of one of the houses that will be built on the 3.5 acre plot of land. Each property will be split over three levels and have its own swimming pool . The second house, illustrated in a computer generated image above. Developers said the three houses would make more of the outdoor space on the site than the previous house . The third property on the site which will be priced at £4.8m, £4m and £3.25m once completed by developers working on the site now . The house was awkwardly positioned on the land, said developers, with its previous lay out not making the most of its space . Among developers's plans is to work on the property's vast grounds to make the most of its green space. Fifty trees will be felled as part of the project with gardeners planting 40 saplings in their place . The property has sweeping views of the harbour on one side and a golf course on the other. It is among around 70 on the peninsula where some Britain's most coveted homes lie . 'We expect these properties to attract couples whose children have grown up and left home.' Nick Blakemore, a director of developers Excellare, said: 'The house that is there is not how it was in its heyday and has become quite run down. 'It is not the style of house that people are looking for now. 'It was spread out across the width of the site, you could probably accommodate 10 houses on it if you wanted but three makes much better use of the space. 'The site borders a nature reserve on one side and a golf course and looks down on the harbour. 'The approach we have taken is to very much work within the environment and not just create a concrete jungle.' Over the last two decades Sandbanks has become a millionaire’s playground with dozens of luxury harbour-front homes worth as much as £12m springing up. The peninsula is home to former Premier League football manager Harry Redknapp, West Bromich Albion boss Tony Pulis, SKY TV soccer pundit Graeme Souness and Maxim Demin, the Russian millionaire owner of Championship club AFC Bournemouth. Last year two luxury homes squeezed onto a plot meant for one went up for sale on Sandbanks for £13million - three times the value of the former property. In 2013 a property sold for the equivalent of £1,275 per square foot, a record for the area.","The 1980s property boasts five bedrooms, four bathrooms, four reception rooms and a swimming pool .

While she's often criticised for regularly recommending outrageously priced luxury items on her lifestyle website,  Gwyneth wants her critics to know that she's just a regular girl. The 42-year-old Oscar-winning actress recently insisted she's like all other women because, despite her fame, she still seeks the same things as others.

She explained: 'What we try to do at Goop is curate and to edit.

During a recent appearance on Bloomberg's Market Makers ahead of International Women's Day, the star said of the perception of her site: 'I think there is sometimes a miscommunication.' 'We aren't a super-luxury site, but we're aspirational. We have things on there that cost $4. We have things on there that cost $500. Sometimes I think that some of the criticism Goop gets is because people haven’t actually gone to the site and looked around and seen what we actually are.' In 2011, the star admitted that the near-deafening criticism she faced over Goop prompted her to consider quitting the brand altogether. 'There were a couple of times when I thought, ""I'm just gonna stop doing it. People are so mean to me. I don't want to do it,""' she told Harper's Bazaar UK. 'But then I was like, ""Who cares what some lame person out there says?"" I was in Italy once, and this old man came up to me and said, ""I had the best time in Nashville because of Goop."" And that is so worth it to me.'","Gwyneth, 42, featured  £27.49 Swim Tee by Land's End .

"An American health care worker who contracted Ebola while volunteering in a Sierra Leone treatment unit has been downgraded to critical condition at the National Institutes of Health, doctors said on Monday. The patient's status was changed from serious to critical condition, meaning the person's condition has apparently worsened. The patient is being treated at the National Institutes of Health's hospital near Washington, D.C. The patient was flown in isolation from Sierra Leone on a chartered plane last week and arrived early on Friday morning. The patient's name, age and gender have not been released. Scroll down for video . A health care worker prepares a colleague's Ebola virus protective gear at a clinic operated by the International Medical Corps in Makeni, Sierra Leone.  Five people in the U.S. are now being monitored after being exposed to Ebola . The person is a clinician working with Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit organization. The group has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November. This came as a second American health care worker who was possibly exposed to Ebola has been moved to Nebraska Medicine's biocontainment unit after a change in symptoms, the hospital said on Monday. The worker was one of four monitored in Nebraska after exposure to another American who tested positive for Ebola. The person who was moved has not tested positive for the virus, the hospital said. None of the patients has been identified. The hospital said it would receive a fifth person who was part of the initial exposure in Sierra Leone later on Monday. The latest NIH patient is the 11th person with Ebola to be treated in the U.S. Two patients in the U.S. have died: a man treated in Dallas after contracting the virus in Africa and a doctor evacuated from Africa to Nebraska when he was already critically ill. The man in Dallas had contracted the virus in his native Liberia. He transmitted the disease to two nurses, resulting in widespread concern in the U.S., with questions raised about emergency department screening of patients, monitoring of ill travelers from Africa and even disputes over the disposal of potentially infectious waste from hospitals. The World Health Organization has estimated the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The current outbreak is the largest ever for the disease. While deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman said that besides the patient at NIH, there are 11 other Partners in Health workers being brought to the United States for monitoring. That includes four going to Atlanta to be near Emory University Hospital; one arrived Friday. On Saturday, four health care workers arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, and three arrived in the Washington area on Sunday to be near the NIH campus in Bethesda. One of those being monitored in Nebraska has developed symptoms of Ebola and was being moved to a biocontainment unit, hospital officials said in a news release on Monday. However, none of those being monitored has tested positive for Ebola. The National Institutes of Health said it has no other pending admissions of additional patients with the Ebola virus or who have been exposed to Ebola. CDC workers in Sierra Leone are involved in investigating the illness of the first patient, including looking for other people the person was in contact with. It's possible other people will be transported to the United States for monitoring, said the spokesman, Tom Skinner.= .

"Ordinary people undergo road rage-like personality changes when using internet sites like Facebook and Twitter, a leading psychologist has warned . Ordinary people undergo road rage-like personality changes when using internet sites like Facebook and Twitter, a leading psychologist has warned. A dangerous combination of people feeling distanced from the person they are abusing and having a vast platform on which to vent anger instantly encourages users to become more aggressive. Just as normally calm drivers sometimes lash out when they get frustrated behind the wheel, so ordinary people can become uncharacteristically angry on social media, said Dr Richard Sherry. The clinical director of Psychological Systems in central London said people using social media were less likely to feel empathy or compassion towards others. He spoke as a new poll found almost nine in ten Britons now admit to having lost their temper more quickly online than in real life. Young people were the least tolerant. Likening the phenomenon to road rage, Dr Sherry said: 'This research shows that, if anything, the online space seems to be robbing us of some of the most fundamental aspects of our humanity. 'When using these sites, people are less likely to feel empathy, patience or compassion towards others; they are significantly quicker to judge and more dangerously reactive in their anger.' The survey questioned 1,000 users of sites including Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram and Pinterest about whether their personality changes while reading and posting messages. Some 84 per cent admitted they become more easily exasperated and enraged at others online than they ever would in person. Young people are particularly prone to internet road rage, with 26 per cent of the 18 to 24 year olds surveyed saying they are 'always' worked up when using social media, compared with 18 per cent of 35 to 44 year olds and just 11 per cent of those in the over-55 age group. The survey, carried out by OnePoll for 'anti-Facebook' social media site Pencourage, also revealed that many regret losing their temper online. Some 35 per cent said they had posted a reply or comment or Tweeted in anger, only to wish they hadn't later. A similar proportion admitted being tempted to vent their rage but said they manage to control themselves. Dr Sherry said that like motorists, users of social websites feel protected behind their screens. They are also emboldened by the relative anonymity and the distance between them and the person they are being rude to. The survey questioned 1,000 users of sites including Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram and Pinterest about whether their personality changes while reading and posting messages. Above, file image . Even the simple fact they aren't speaking out loud and so don't hear what they are saying can make them more reckless. The psychologist, who would like some social media websites to carry warnings that they can make people more impulsive, said: 'The psychological damage we can cause to ourselves and others must undoubtedly be taken into account when interacting via social media. 'Just as we try to be calm ahead of a tense situation on the road, equally we should take a few breaths before posting messages or sending emails.' Peter Clayton, founder of Pencourage, which bans textspeak and encourages positive messages, said that people are clearly more antagonistic and judgemental on traditional social networking sites and 'now specialists even have a name for it'. Daniel Miller, a social media researcher at University College London, said that other research suggests the opposite is true. A recent study of Facebook pages of people in southern Italy found that fewer than 10 per cent of comments were negative – and even those used wit and irony to get their point across, rather than hate. Professor Miller said: 'Rage' is mainly limited to teenage girls quarrelling with each other on Twitter and some political ranting.'","Social media users feel distanced from target of abuse, says psychologist .

"A Cambridge University finance officer stole nearly £300,000 from work to feed a multi-million-pound addiction to online fruit machines. Jacqueline Balaam, 41, took the funds from Pembroke College to shore up a crippling gambling habit that saw her wager more than £6million over eight years. She would sometimes win five-figure sums but rarely kept them – instead using the money to pay for more bets on internet site Jackpotjoy. Jacqueline Balaam, 41 (left and right) abused her position as a purchase ledger clerk at Pembroke College . The married mother of two hung her head in shame and sobbed yesterday as she was jailed for 30 months after admitting a series of fraud charges. Cambridge Crown Court heard how Balaam was gripped by a gambling addiction when she joined historic Pembroke College, whose alumni include 19th century prime minister William Pitt and poet Ted Hughes, in 2009. Three years later she was abusing her trusted position as a purchase ledger clerk to duplicate invoices, paying the money into her own account. Balaam, who was in charge of paying suppliers of goods and services, would then use her work’s accounting system to change details and cover her tracks. Her crimes were uncovered when the college carried out an internal audit, revealing she had taken more than £285,000. Police also found she had stolen £3,000 over four years from a village social club near Cambridge where she volunteered to act as treasurer. Staff at Pembroke College (pictured) only uncovered her crime in January 2014 after an audit revealed she had stolen £285,986 . During interviews she admitted she was hooked on Jackpotjoy after joining in 2006. The site, which describes itself as the UK’s biggest online bingo site, also offers gamblers the chance to play online fruit machines. Prosecutor Sara Walker told the court: ‘She told police that she had a gambling addiction and that she played online on a laptop given to her by the social club.’ Balaam, said to have wagered a total of £6,383,126 using the stolen money and her own cash, took an overdose on the day she was arrested but recovered after hospital treatment. She admitted a series of fraud charges in court yesterday, where she was supported by her partner. Jackpotjoy, fronted by Barbara Windsor in its adverts, claims to be the UK's biggest online bingo site . Balaam told the court she had an addiction to online gambling website Jackpotjoy, and has made 'real efforts' to tackle her addiction since her arrest . Mark Shelley, defending, said his client had been led astray by her gambling habit. ‘She must have spent a lot of time on this addiction and she knew she was losing everything,’ he added. ‘There were no expensive holidays or cars or anything like that. It was all spent on gambling.’ Judge Gareth Hawkesworth told Balaam: ‘It is clear that your taking of this money was prompted by an addiction and it is equally clear that such was your addiction that you made no real profit from it and no money was spent for the benefit of your family. ‘I cannot suspend the sentence because of the sheer scale of what you did and the length of time which you proceeded with it. You are an intelligent woman and you were well able to seek help during that period and you did not do so.’ Balaam, who lives in a £250,000 terraced house in Cambridge, was sacked after her arrest. Pembroke College, which was founded in 1347 and whose Master is former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove, said it had now changed its accounting processes following the frauds by Balaam.","Mother-of-two Jacqueline Balaam, 41, took funds from Pembroke College .

"A disabled woman who defied the odds to exchange vows with her partner and become Britain's first married couple with Down's syndrome has died aged 45. Andrea and her husband Paul defied the odds - and social workers - to marry one another in 2004. The childhood sweethearts met in a home for children with learning difficulties and after falling in love as teenagers they fought a long battle to be allowed to marry. Disabled Andrea Annear, 45, from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, has died aged 45. She and her husband made history in 2004 when they became Britain's first married couple with Down's syndrome (pictured) When the Daily Mail interviewed them in 2006, Andrea, then aged 37,  said: 'I love Paul this much. Now he is my husband I am so proud. 'I give him a kiss in the morning when he leaves for work, and I shout after him 'I love you, Paul' and he says 'I love you, Andrea', and I watch him as he walks all the way down the road. 'I know that some people say we should not have got married, but why not? We love each other very much and we look after each other.' Andrea had a known heart condition related to her disability, and the couple relied on a daily carer to check that they are coping with domestic tasks - but other than that, they were much like any other married couple. The couple (pictured) met in a home for children with learning difficulties when Andrea was just three . Andrea was just three years old when she was sent to live at the Ormerod Children's Home in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire. Paul, who had been raised in a foster home, arrived at Ormerod when he was 13, when his elderly foster mother was unable to cope. They became fast friends and eventually fell in love, but in 1996 Andrea was re-housed in a secure community house, while Paul remained at Ormerod, which had been turned into an adult centre. While social workers were pleased with the move - with her high-functioning Down's syndrome, Andrea was able to take a part-time job at a local hotel - no one realised she was missing Paul. Andrea said: 'I missed him. I heard music and I wanted to dance with him. If I felt sad inside my heart, there was no one to make me laugh any more. 'I wanted to see my friend, so I asked my carer if I could invite him over for tea, and she said yes. I was so excited and I chose some special biscuits.' After arrangements by social workers caring for the pair Paul was driven to Andrea's house for a three-hour visit. The couple battled against the odds to continue to see each other and eventually said they wanted to marry . When the front door opened they fell into each other's arms - much to the astonishment of onlookers. Some local authorities have been known to make disabled couples perform a capacity assessment to determine whether they are sufficiently able to have sexual relations and get married without a high risk of abuse or exploitation. But Section 1 of the Mental Capacity Act says a person must be assumed to have capacity until it is established that they do not. Disabled people often have to fight the assumption that because they have a learning disability they lack the capacity to marry or to have sexual relations . Mencap's chief executive, Jan Tregelles, said last year: 'For someone with a learning disability to have their right to marry so seriously interfered with is not only heartbreaking for the couple and their families, but a denial of their basic human rights. 'Professionals and wider society are too quick to make prejudiced and ill-informed judgments about what people with a learning disability can and can't do.' Sexual health charity FPA ran a campaign a few years ago to highlight the rights of people with learning disabilities to have relationships. The fight for the right to marry is part of a wider battle for people with learning disabilities to have a family. Carer Eve Millar said: 'It suddenly became obvious just how much they had missed each other. 'Andrea was so thrilled to see Paul - she took him by the hand and led him to her little sitting room, and they were both so happy. 'They had always been inseparable at the children's home - and suddenly here they were, together again and loving every moment. Without each other, they existed. Together, they just shone.' The couple battled against the odds  to continue to see each other and eventually said they wanted to marry. Their wish stunned social workers who worried about the implications of such a marriage, the possible pregnancy and whether the couple could understand the meaning and legality of their vows. Initially a compromise was reached and the couple received a blessing in 1995. But for Andrea and Paul this was not enough. The committed Christians, who went to church every week, wanted a church ceremony with all the trimmings. They  were over the age of consent and social workers and the Trust staff were finally forced to relent. Andrea said at the time: 'Paul asked me to marry him and I told him yes. I cried -  some big fat tears went down my face because I was so happy. 'Paul got down on his knee and said: 'Will you marry me?' and I said: 'Yes.' I loved him so much I could actually feel it inside my heart. I had seen pictures of ladies getting married, in magazines, and I wanted to look like that, too. 'I wanted to have a pretty white dress, and I wanted Paul to have a smart suit and I wanted to be with him always. That is what marriage means — to love somebody and to be with them always.' Andrea said: 'I am just a normal wife and Paul is just my normal husband. That's all we've ever wanted to be' Andrea was given anti pregnancy injections because her weak heart might not have coped with childbirth and the couple saved up for gold rings,wedding dress and suit. Their wedding was held on September 24, 2004 with the blessing of the Church and the authorities at the United Reform Church at St Annes on Sea,Lancashire. Sue Sharples, then director of the Trust said:'Their were many barriers put ibn their way but their love for each other was so obvious but the birth control was needed to protect Andrea's heart.' MP Mark Menzies, a Trust patron said: 'I was very sad to hear of the death of Andrea she was a well known figure in the town. 'They were the first couple with Downs to marry in this country and were inseparable in their time together.This is a difficult time for Paul and my thoughts are with him.' Andrea told the Mail in 2006: 'We love being Mr and Mrs together. I make Paul a meal in the evening and we sit on the sofa next to each other. We love to watch Coronation Street or Doctor Who. 'We look at our wedding album every day and the pictures make us smile. If it is sunny, we go for walks and we hold hands. Or Paul plays his music and we dance and tell each other jokes.' She added: 'I am just a normal wife and Paul is just my normal husband. That's all we've ever wanted to be.' Carol Boys, CEO of the Down’s Syndrome Association, said: 'We were so sorry to hear the sad news of Andrea's death. 'This was such an inspirational story of true love triumphing over all and it paved the way for so many others to follow. All our thoughts are with Paul and the family at this very difficult time.'","Andrea and Paul Annear became first married couple with the disability .

"The dog captured in the heartbreaking image showing her being abandoned at a gas station has been taken into care by an animal agency and will be put up for adoption. The German Shepherd mix, Butterbean, was taken into custody by the Humane Society of Louisiana after the owner released her for $400. While the animal was initially thought to be abandoned on the side of the road in Slidell, Louisiana last week, she was reportedly abandoned as a puppy and had been allowed by her owner to live at large  in a nearby neighborhood for six years. Her apparent owner, who is reportedly Lisa Pearson, said that Butterbean loves the man in the truck and that she was following him to work the morning the picture was taken, according to WDSU. The German Shepherd mix captured in the heartbreaking image showing her being abandoned at a gas station has been taken into care. Butterbean, was taken into custody by the Humane Society of Louisiana after the owner released her for $400 . This is the heartbreaking moment from last week when Butterbean was seen desperately chasing after a car where it appeared she was being abandoned at a gas station on the side of a road in Slidell, Louisiana . Butterbean is currently at the Furry Friends Animal Hospital in Harvey, Louisiana, according to ABC. 'We're delighted that this story will have a happy ending,' said Jeff Dorson, the Human Society's founder and executive director, in a memo on Tuesday. The agency has already received applications to adopt Butterbean, and prospective applicants will be interviewed as they work to put her in the best suited home. The dog was captured in the photograph that surfaced last week by witness Lorie Hollis, who said she saw a man drop off the dog near a gas station on Highway 11. She said the man yelled 'Go! Go over there!' Hollis said the animal was confused and jumped up, putting her paws on the tailgate of the man's pickup truck before giving chase after the truck sped off, trying desperately to keep up. After the animal took off after the truck, Hollis got into her car and tried to follow the dog and vehicle, watching the shepherd cross two lanes of traffic as the animal attempted to reach the man. But after driving for a couple of miles, Hollis lost sight of them both. 'My heart is broken,' she told WDSU at the time of the incident. 'I am in shock that someone would treat a dog like this.' Dorson said when animals are abandoned in a 'random location' they have 'almost zero' chance of survival. Butterbean is currently at the Furry Friends Animal Hospital in Harvey, Louisiana, and she will be put up for adoption soon . Applications to adopt her have already been submitted, and prospective applicants will be interviewed as the agency works to put her in the best suited home . Employees at the gas station and neighbors told WDSU last week that the dog was not being abandoned and that the man driving the truck lives in the neighborhood. The Humane Society wrote a post on Facebook about successfully locating Butterbean on March 20. 'When Butterbean was found, she was on the property of a family claiming to have owned her for 6-7 years,' the post said. 'They admitted to allowing her to roam at large during that time and reported that the man in the truck is actually a neighbor who the dog is attached to, who she follows routinely to the gas station. 'Given this information, we are truly amazed that Butterbean has survived these many years.' After Butterbean was found, Pearson said that she intended to keep the dog tethered outside. But following the agency bringing the case to the attention of St. Tammany Animal Control, the owner was issued a warning, and agreed to release the dog for cash. The Humane Society wrote a post on Facebook about successfully locating the animal on March 20 . The owner also signed an agreement not to chain or tether any animal in future or allow them to roam at large. 'We certainly don't like to reward this kind of behavior, but sometimes it simply takes too long for cases to move through the legal system,' said Dorson. 'Our first concern was Butterbean's safety. We were convinced she could be let loose again to run in traffic at any time, and we might miss our opportunity to intervene.' By claiming ownership, the family in question may still be held accountable for violating several ordinances relating to the dog's behavior. Following the incident, the Humane Society is launching a Butterbean's Buddies campaign, which will run for a year, and will help reach more deserving dogs in need. Dorson said Butterbean's story can help shed light on the fact that other Louisiana dogs are chained, abandoned or  neglected each year. A nearby woman snapped the photograph after she saw a man drop off the dog on Highway 11 (pcitured) and yelled at his pet to 'Go! Go over there!' The dog then gave chase after the truck sped off .","Butterbean, a German Shepherd mix, appeared in the photo to have been dropped off at a gas station in Slidell, Louisiana last week, causing outrage .

"Police officers failed to spot that an elderly widow whose throat had been cut had been murdered. Una Crown, 86, was repeatedly stabbed in the neck and then set on fire in the horrific attack at the bungalow where she lived alone. But detectives, paramedics and firefighters trampled through her home, ‘severely contaminating’ the murder scene, after concluding that she had somehow set herself alight after falling on her cooker. Police had found the body of the retired postmistress, pictured with late husband Jack Roland Crown, covered in blood and with her clothing 'burnt to a crisp' in the hallway . Muddy footprints were left on the floor, a detective touched her front door key with his bare hand and her grieving family was even allowed into the property to clean it up. Concerns were only raised two days later by a mortuary technician. It was another two days before a pathologist examined the body and confirmed the fatal injuries, along with multiple defensive wounds on Mrs Crown’s hands. Detectives are still hunting the killer two years after her brutal death. Coroner William Morris yesterday attacked the services involved for allowing vital clues to be lost as he recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. ‘I have to say the handling of evidence by the police has been unfortunate,’ he said. A theory was formed relatively early on by acting detective sergeant Simon Gledhill that Una Crown had fallen on the hob or cooker and somehow set fire to herself and panicked, and had a heart attack and collapsed in the hallway. ‘In this suspicious death, foul play was too readily dismissed by police officers.’ Not treating the area as a full crime scene prevented a ‘proper forensic examination’ from being carried out. Mrs Crown’s niece, Judith Paynes, told the hearing she was lost for words. ‘I cannot understand why this evidence wasn’t picked up,’ she said. Una Crown, 86, was found dead in the hallway of her bungalow in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, after family and neighbours became concerned for her welfare . Mrs Crown, a retired postmistress, was found dead at her home in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, on January 13, 2013, after family and friends became concerned about her whereabouts. She was covered in blood with her clothing ‘burnt to a crisp’ when the emergency services found her. Mr Gledhill was one of the first officers to arrive. In a statement to the inquest in Huntingdon he said there was no sign of forced entry and the death ‘looked accidental’. Emergency services collectively concluded that the fire was caused when a tea towel caught fire on the hob. Home Office pathologist Nat Carey told the hearing: ‘This was clearly a homicide from the wounds I saw – that’s not to say that’s how it was treated. ‘I concluded that she died from multiple stab wounds to her chest and neck.’ Police cordoned off the home after the original officers, paramedics and firefighters who attended the scene on January 13 2013 all decided the widow had died in an accident . Forensic teams finally investigate the crime scene outside Mrs Crown's home- four days after her body was found . Senior investigator Detective Inspector Fraser Wylie told the inquest: ‘The scene was severely contaminated by the police, firefighters and paramedics because this had not been initially picked up as a murder investigation.’ A paramedic had prodded the body and transferred Mrs Crown’s blood to a light switch before rummaging through a chest of drawers. Mr Gledhill used latex gloves during his time at the house but admitted washing a bloodstained key under a tap after he touched it. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hopkins said the family’s complaints had been upheld in a review by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire professional standards department in June 2013. Officers were provided with extra training as a result but none faced formal disciplinary procedures. ‘We recognise the failings by our officers in the initial stages of this investigation and we are deeply sorry for any hurt this has caused Mrs Crown’s family,’ he said. Several people have been arrested in connection with the murder, but all have been released without charge. Home Office pathologist Nat Cary found the death was 'clearly homicide' and 'said that the police's delay had meant that the crime scene had been 'severely contaminated'","Una Crown found burnt and stabbed but police initially ruled it an accident .
