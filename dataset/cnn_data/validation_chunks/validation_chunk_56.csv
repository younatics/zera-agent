"When you are forking out hundreds of pounds for a night in a fancy hotel, you would expect decent wi-fi to be thrown in for free. But luxury hotels are charging as much as £19.50 for 24 hours of high-speed internet access – whereas many coffee shops, shopping centres and pubs give customers a good service for nothing. In contrast, budget hotel Travelodge offers customers a 30-minute grace period then asks for £3 for a day of internet – whereas rival Premier Inn offers customers free internet and an upgraded service for just £5. Many luxury hotels are charging for a good wi-fi connection, which many coffee shops and pubs offer for free . The Dorchester in London charges guests £19.50 a day for premium wi-fi, but it's free in one of their top suites . A Sunday Times survey of 50 hotels, including the most expensive and those with budget room rates, revealed a third have extra charges for wi-fi. Almost all hotels that charge for internet use allows guests free wi-fi in communal areas, but the service usually quite slow. The Dorchester in London's Mayfair describes itself as the 'favourite choice of celebrities, world leaders, royalty and high society'. But even they would have to pay £19.50 per day for premium wi-fi – although it's a complimentary perk if staying in one of their elite suites, which cost up to £3,700 a night. The Langham in London, where suites cost up to £24,000-a-night, high-speed wi-fi will cost you an extra £15 . At the Langham in London, the suites cost up to an eye-watering £24,000 a night, high-speed wi-fi costs guests £15. Guests at the Park Tower in Knightsbridge and the Hilton Manchester Deansgate also have to pay about £15 for wi-fi in rooms. The Sheraton Grand Hotel in Edinburgh's basic wi-fi is free, but charges £12.95 for a premium service. The Savoy and Mandarin Oriental hotels in Hyde Park, London, offer customers free premium wi-fi for a day, but only if you sign up as a member. Otherwise, it's £15 and the Mandarin Oriental and £9.95 at The Savoy. The Savoy and Mandarin Oriental (pictured) hotels in London offer customers free premium wi-fi if they sign up as members . A spokesman for The Dorchester hotel told MailOnline that guests are offered free access to a connection speed up to 512kb - but charge for those wishing to download larger files and stream video. She said: 'We provide free access to a connection speed of 512kb which enables our guests to stay connected through email, social media, using apps, and browsing the internet. 'To meet the requirements of guests who wish to download extremely large files or stream video content, we bring large capacity fibre internet into the property to offer an optional premium service with extremely fast upload and download speeds which is charged at £19.50. 'This charge is included in our top suite rates.' She added hotel guests also have access to a team of eButlers, who are available to assist with any IT requirements. In comparison, budget chain Premier Inn offers customers free internet and an upgraded service for just £5 . Jackie Grech, of the British Hospitality Association, told the Sunday Times the reason for the extra charges is because hotels realise that 'wi-fi is as important as hot water' for guests. She explained premium wi-fi will continue to cost guests more because the investment costs for delivering the service is greater. The Dorchester, Premier Inn and the Langhan told the newspaper they provided a high-quality service and were committed to ensuring guest satisfaction. Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group and Hilton Worldwide cited their loyalty programmes, which offer free connection to guests who sign up to become members. But The Savoy told the paper they were re-evaluating their stance on charging for internet. MailOnline has contacted the hotels for comment.","The Dorchester in London charges guests £19.50 per day for premium wi-fi .

"From dangling  on a broken zip wire to clumsily peddling himself around on a namesake bike, there's little Boris Johnson won't do for a good photograph. But the Mayor seemed to have bitten off more than he could chew today when photographed gracelessly sampling local delicacies at a school in Yarm, North Yorkshire. With a plate piled high with Parmo and chips, the politician posed for cameras in a scene reminiscent of Ed Miliband's disastrous devouring of a bacon sandwich. Elsewhere leader Nigel Farage was spotted bashfully tucking in to a Cornish pasty while campaigning in one of Ukip's target seats. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson was captured clumsily tasting local delicacies at a school in North Yorkshire in the latest of a string of bizarre photographs which show politicians eating awkwardly . An appetite for life: The London mayor looked quizzical as he made his way through the Middlesbrough dish . Struggling: Nigel Farage fell into the same camp of awkward eaters after being snapped trying to tuck in to a Cornish pasty during a break from the campaign trail . Like his Labour counterpart, the Tory Mayor of London may have been well advised to take smaller, fewer bites as he tried the Middlesbrough dish. Having shovelled fork fulls of chicken and cheese into his mouth Mr Johnson, who previously confessed to loving 'all food', summed up the meal as 'delicious', seemingly disappointed not to be able to finish it. In Redruth, Ukip leader Nigel Farage made his way through a flaky Cornish pasty while taking a break from the campaign trail. Keeping the paper bag it came in close to his chin to catch any crumbs, Mr Farage stretched his mouth around the snack to the delight of a passing photographer. Theirs are the latest in a bizarre string of awkward eating stunts carried out by British politicians sparked by Ed Miliband's encounter with a stubborn bacon buttie. Nestled in at a steel dining set Mr Miliband in New Covent Garden Market last May, the Labour leader wrestled with the sandwich to the amusement of assembled photographers. Parmo is flattened chicken breast smothered in bread crumbs and topped with bechamel sauce and cheddar cheese. Originally referred to as Chicken Parmesan, it is a favourite in takeaways across the North East. It typically consists of chicken but pork is sometimes used instead. The dish is thought to have originated in a Middlesbrough takeaway around 40 years ago. His face contorted and mouth full, the photographs saw him accused of being further out of touch with ordinary people than ever before. In 2012 David Cameron was caught in a similarly embarrassing pose while enjoying a hot dog with President Obama. The Prime Minister was watching a basketball game with his American counterpart when the pair were snapped shoving mustard-glazed sausages into their mouths. During his visit to Yarm today Boris Johnson canvassed a group of teenagers for their support in the forthcoming election. He had travelled to the area to back MP James Wharton in his campaign for the seat of Stockton South. Addressing a class of students he said: 'There's a dense umbilical connection between the two parts of the economy, that's why I have come all the way to Conyers School to tell you about this incredible link between London and Stockton.'

"A cyclist claims he was warned by police he could face an assault charge after he saw a driver throw litter out of his car so threw it back through his window. The rider filmed the moment he confronted the motorist, who got out of his vehicle and asked him for a fight in Dumbarton, near Glasgow. In the footage the cyclist tells the driver, who is wearing a white cap and white t-shirt, 'here's your stupid litter back', before throwing the cup into the man's Vauxhall Corsa. But after contacting the police the cyclist was warned he could be charged with common assault for instigating the fight. Scroll down for video . Row: This is the moment a driver asked a cyclist for a fight after he confronted him about dropping litter . Drama: In the footage the cyclist tells the driver: 'Here's your stupid litter back', before throwing the cup into the man's Vauxhall Corsa . Officers added that no charges would be brought against the driver for threatening behaviour. The 20 year-old cyclist, who has asked not to be named, posted the video online last Thursday in an attempt to shame the motorist. He said: 'I just thought for some reason in my head I should be confronting this person. I wasn't intending it in a very aggressive way. 'As I approached the driver I asked him to roll down the window and this was when I threw the cup in the window.' The rider's video shows him picking up an empty Pepsi cup he claims the driver threw from his car. He then pedalled after the black car, which was caught in traffic and tossed the cup back through his window. Evidence: The cyclist filmed the car and the cup he claims was thrown out of the window in Dumbarton, Scotland . The rider's video shows him picking up an empty Pepsi cup he claims the driver threw from his car . Fury: The driver rushed out of his car to asked if he wants to go to a local park for a 'square go' - slang for a fight . The furious motorist leapt from his seat and challenged the cyclist to a fight before driving off. He then turned around and wound down his window to hurl more abuse at the cyclist as he passed. The cyclist caught the incident on a head cam and tried to report the motorist to police. In an expletive-laden rant, the driver says: 'What do you think you're doing, do you think you're smart or something? Get off the bike.' He then walks back to his car, before driving past the cyclist, rolling down his window and asking if he wants to go to a local park for a 'square go'. The cyclist declined and hurriedly pedalled away from the scene in Dumbarton, Scotland. When the cyclist sent the video to police  he said two officers came to his house to see the footage. He claims they told he they could not bring a Breach of the Peace charge against the driver because the cyclist was clearly the instigator for throwing the cup inside the car. They suggested that he should be charged with common assault but the case was dropped. The cyclist said: 'I do feel this guy needs to be named and shamed.'","Rider threw cup into Corsa and said: 'Here's your stupid litter back'

"A jealous transvestite who attacked the Polish wife of a man she fancied with her stiletto shoe is facing jail. Plagad Somian, 23, began hassling Marek Pietrzycka, 45, when she saw him walking with his wife Katarzyna in the street in Pattaya, a city on the east coast of Thailand known as a sex tourist hotspot. She reportedly told him to 'ditch the b**** and make the switch' which annoyed Mrs Pietrzycka, 42, who told Somian her husband was not interested before taking his hand and walking off. Katarzyne Pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai transvestite jealous over her husband, leaving her bleeding heavily from her head (right) following the assault in the east coast Thai city of Pattaya . Transvestite Plagad Somian, 23, has been arrested over the incident after allegedly flying into a jealous rage . Mrs Pietrzycka is comforted in hospital after the horror attack. She and her husband were trying to walk away . But as the couple tried to leave the brunette sex worker flipped, taking off her shoe and striking Pietrzycka in the face, knocking her to the ground and screaming: 'Don't f***ing mess with me you ugly whore.' Fellow tourist Oliver Kolar, 33, told local TV: 'The ladyboy had been talking to the woman's husband and she obviously didn't like it. 'The blonde started telling the man they were leaving, and the next thing you knew the ladyboy went mental, took off her shoe and smashed it into the woman's face. 'She was swearing a lot and when she attacked, the blonde went down like a tonne of bricks and was lying on the floor with blood streaming down her face. 'The ladyboy then hit her again and that's when the man, who I assumed was her husband, pulled her off.' Police quickly arrived on the scene and arrested Somian, who was being calmed down by fellow transvestites. Local man Son-Ram Wonggoun, 42, said: 'Foreigners are quite vulnerable around here and there have been a few incidents where they have been robbed or ripped off. The Polish tourist was struck in the face and knocked to the ground while on holiday in Pattaya, Thailand . Somian is detained. She reportedly shouted 'ditch the b**** and make the switch' before launching the attack . 'But I have never seen anything like this. 'The local working girls and ladyboys are temperamental but are normally very good to tourists as that is their trade. 'Attacking one is bad news for everyone as it will give us a bad reputation. 'People won't come here and enjoy what's on offer if they feel threatened by the prospect of violence. 'It was clear that this blond lady was on holiday with her man for sightseeing and not there for the other stuff. 'The ladyboy should have stayed away.' A police spokesman said: 'She admitted attacking the woman but said she had done it in a fit of rage at being slighted. She said the Polish woman had insulted her.

"Dramatic recordings from the Germanwings flight’s black box have revealed the captain’s desperate attempts to break into the cockpit to regain control of the plane. According to transcripts published today, captain Patrick Sondheimer screamed ‘Open the goddamn door!’ as his killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately flew the aircraft into an Alpine ravine after he had left to go to the toilet. Yesterday, it was revealed that Lubitz was living 'on the edge' because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot's licence. Scroll down for video . Captain Patrick Sondheimer is heard with co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, pictured, who tells him he can go to the toilet at any time and he will take over the controls, noting that the pilot didn’t go to the lavatory in Barcelona . Investigation: Reports emerged that police searching the pilot's flat had found a 'small mountain of pills' and he had apparently been refusing to take his antidepressants medication. Above, Lubitz in 2013 . Search workers collect debris at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 in the French Alps, above the town of Seyne-les-Alpes . The personal effects of the plane's 150 victims can be seen through the piles of rubble . Clothes from the plane's cargo lie strewn across the mountainside. Dramatic recordings from the Germanwings flight’s black box have revealed the captain’s desperate attempts to break into the cockpit to regain control of the plane . A French rescue worker inspects the remains of the Germanwings Airbus A320 at the site of the crash . Lubitz is believed to have locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck, and used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually - and deliberately. A transcript published in today’s edition of the German newspaper Bild, reveals that the chilling recording starts with captain Sondheimer apologising to passengers for a 26-minute delay in Barcelona, and promising to make up the time on the flight to Dusseldorf. In the next 20 minutes, Sondheimer converses with co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who tells him he can go to the toilet at any time and he will take over the controls, noting that the pilot didn’t go to the lavatory in Barcelona. At 10.27am, the airliner reaches its cruising altitude of 38,000ft. The pilot prompts his first officer to prepare for the landing in Dusseldorf. The French prosecutors described Lubitz’s replies as ‘laconic’, and he is heard using words such as ‘hopefully’ and ‘we’ll see’. After the checks for landing, Lubitz says to Sondheimer again: ‘You can go now.’ Lubitz was sitting in this cockpit, pictured, when he commanded the jet to crash into the Alps at 400mph . The pilot lets another two minutes elapse, then he says to Lubitz: ‘You can take over.’ There is the sound of a seat being pushed back and the snap of a door. At 10.29am the flight radar monitors the plane descending. At 10.30am it is down by 316ft, and just a minute later, it is down 1,800ft. At 10.32am air traffic controllers try to contact the aircraft, but get no response. In the plane, the automatic alarm signal ‘Sink Rate’ sounds almost at the same time, according to the voice recorder. Dramatic recordings from the Germanwings flight’s black box have revealed the captain’s desperate attempts to break into the cockpit to regain control of the plane . Shortly afterwards there is a loud bang, which sounds like someone trying to enter the cockpit. Sondheimer yells: ‘For God’s sake, open the door!’ In the background, passengers can be heard screaming. At 10.35am ‘loud, metallic banging against the cockpit door’ is heard again, according to the French authorities. The jet is still 7,000ft above the ground. About 90 seconds later there is a new warning message – ‘Ground! Pull up! Pull up!’ The pilot is heard shouting: ‘Open the goddamn door!’ At 10.38am, with its engines racing, the aircraft is on a north-east course over the French Alps. The breathing of Lubitz can be heard in the cockpit but he says nothing. Access to the cockpit door on the Germanwings Airbus A320 (like the one above) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking . At 10.40am the aircraft hits the mountainside with its right wing. The last sounds are more screams from passengers. It is believed that Sondheimer resorted to using a crowbar to try and get through the armoured panel as the plane plunged fatally towards the Alps. German newspaper Bild yesterday reported that he had attempted to use an axe, and a Germanwings spokesman confirmed that such a tool was on board the aircraft. But the only axe on the plane would have been in the cockpit, meaning it was out of reach of the captain. It has emerged that Lubitz once planned to marry his long-term girlfriend but she broke off the relationship because his Jekyll and Hyde personality left her fearing for her safety, it was claimed. The woman, named as teacher Kathrin Goldbach, is understood to have called time on Lubitz's increasingly erratic and controlling behaviour just weeks before the Germanwings crash. Reports emerged that police searching the pilot's flat had found a 'small mountain of pills' and he had apparently been refusing to take his antidepressants medication. Miss Goldbach still lived with Lubitz, 27, but it is understood she was on the lookout for a flat after being driven away by his need to be in charge. He even tried to tell her what to wear, friends said. While outwardly confident, his hidden insecurity demanded constant attention – which led him to betray Kathrin with a five-month fling with a Germanwings stewardess conducted in cheap hotels. But she, too, is believed to have ended her relationship after growing fearful of the 'tormented and erratic' Lubitz. At an extraordinary press conference, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin gave a disturbing account of the cockpit voice recordings extracted from black box. He said Lubitz locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck. He said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph). 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'. Referring to Lubitz, Mr Robin said: 'He did this for a reason which we don't know why, but we can only deduct that he destroyed this plane. We have asked for information from the German investigation on both his profession and personal background'. Mr Robin said he had no known links with terrorism, adding: 'There is no reason to suspect a terrorist attack.' Family members of a victim pause in front of a stele, a stone slab erected as a monument, set up in the area where the Germanwings aircraft crashed in the French Alps, in Le Vernet, France . The crash on Tuesday killed all 150 people aboard. Reports have emerged that police searching the pilot's flat had found a 'small mountain of pills' and he had apparently been refusing to take his antidepressant medication . Two teddy bears dressed in the uniforms of a Germanwings pilot and a flight attendant sit in the centre of a wreath outside the Germanwings headquarters at Cologne-Bonn airport . And asked whether he believed the crash that killed 150 people was the result of suicide, he said: 'People who commit suicide usually do so alone... I don't call it a suicide.' Mr Robin, who had earlier briefed the families of the dead – and separately those of both pilots – said the screams of passengers aware of their fate could be heard in the final seconds of the recording. It also emerged that his parents only discovered that their son was a mass murderer just minutes before the bombshell press conference by prosecutors in Marseille. His mother, a piano teacher, and father, a successful businessman, were understood to be in the French city at the time of the announcement, but kept separate from the victims' relatives. Their whereabouts are now unknown, but it is believed they are being questioned by police. The couple's £400,00 two-storey detached home in Montabaur, a town 40 miles from Bonn where Lubitz is thought to have grown up, was also searched by detectives. As a child, Lubitz is said to have always wanted to be a pilot and covered his bedroom walls with pictures of planes and collected model aircraft. 10.01am: Plane takes off from Barcelona 26 minutes late . 10.27am: Reaches cruising altitude of 38,000ft.

"Comedian Russell Brand has revealed his plans for a new chain of non-profit businesses which would boast their own currency. The left-wing activist was on the New Era council estate in Hoxton, east London, to open a new cafe today where he gave a speech - hours after he was voted one of the world's greatest thinkers. Brand said he will donate all money from the paperback sales of his book 'Revolution', to The Trew Cafe, which will be staffed by recovering addicts undergoing 'abstinence-based recovery'. Russell Brand spoke outside the Trew Era cafe, which opened today on the New Era council estate in Hoxton, east London . The left-wing activist told the 200-strong crowd that he plans to donate the money made from his book 'Revolution' towards the cafe . It is also on the site where he previously helped locals protesting against rent increases and possible eviction despite living in a £2million bachelor pad owned by a firm based in a tax haven. Speaking outside the cafe, which is named after the estate fused with his YouTube show, The Trews, he said: 'It is a model that is not for profit, a fully self-supporting, new economic enterprise.' He ambitiously claimed that he plans to set up more of these social enterprises, adding: 'Eventually we will trade with one another in our own currency. 'We are going to create our own systems, our own federations, our own currencies, our own authorities.' He was joined at the opening by several local residents including Lynsay Spiteri (right of Brand), Danielle Molinari (far right) and Lindsey Garrett (left) Brand claimed that he plans to set up more of these social enterprises which will trade in their own currency . The 39-year-old, who was joined by a crowd of 200 supporters, also accused mainstream political parties of abandoning people on inner city estates. 'As long as you have only got parties that are interested in causing division, hatred and representing big businesses, we will create our own systems,' he said. 'Politics is dead, this is the end of politics. What we are discussing is what comes after, something worse or something better.' He met with several residents today on the same site where he previously protested against rent increases and possible eviction . The stand-up act added that 'it is not a charity, it is a new business model', describing it as a place for local people to get together and eat food grown and made in the community. It came the day after he was named as the world's fourth greatest thinker by readers of intellectual magazine Prospect. The self-styled revolutionary beat the likes of Nobel peace prize winner Henry Kissinger and Booker prize recipient Hilary Mantel to make it into the top ten list of influential minds. In its latest edition, Prospect described Brand as 'the spiritual leader of Britain's disaffected anti-capitalist youth', but it has since faced backlash for including the anarchist on social media. Drayton Bird ‏wrote on Twitter: 'Beyond parody: if this wag is a great thinker, my vote goes to Peppa Pig.' Tim Walker added: 'A generation or so ago, Bertrand Russell was considered to be a great thinker. Now, comically, it's Russell Brand.' The television and radio presenter  lost his BBC Radio 2 slot over prank calls to actor Andrew Sachs in 2008. Since then the millionaire attempted to re-brand himself as an anti-capitalist revolutionary, but it has been mired in doubt as celebrities including Simon Cowell accused him  of hypocrisy. He accused the comedian of accepting large Hollywood film salaries whilst campaigning against the UK political system. The stand-up was named as the world's fourth greatest thinker by readers of intellectual magazine Prospect .","Russell Brand was on council estate in east London opening a cafe today .

"Today's long awaited report into Britain's surveilance powers was sparked by the Edward Snowden revelations . GCHQ was last night cleared of carrying out mass surveillance of the public using vast trawls of internet traffic. The Intelligence and Security Committee said the central claims made by the Guardian newspaper on the back of documents stolen by American whistle-blower Edward Snowden were wrong and it cleared the Government’s listening station of wrongdoing. After an 18-month inquiry, the committee dismissed the claims that GCHQ had ‘blanket coverage’ of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages. In reality, it said, GCHQ can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a ‘tiny fraction’ of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process. The committee concluded that the only items seen by analysts were those of the ‘highest intelligence value’, and these amounted to several thousand a day. Tory MP Mark Field, a member of the committee, said: ‘The big mistake that Snowden and the Guardian made in its coverage was to equate bulk data with bulk surveillance. ‘The truth is that the filtering process means that a tiny proportion of the bulk data that is collected is ever examined. ‘That point was never really made by the Guardian, who gave the impression that with every phone call, every email and every text message, the public had a spy on their shoulder.’ Labour MP Hazel Blears said the ‘two main claims’ made off the back of the Snowden leaks were untrue and surveillance was neither blanket nor indiscriminate. ‘What we’ve found is that the way in which the agencies use the capabilities they have is authorised, lawful, necessary and proportionate. Labour MP Hazel Blears chaired the press conference on the Intelligence and Security Committee's long-awaited report into Britain's spy agencies . GCHQ Headquarters, based in Cheltenham, is the Government's main listening post and is allowed to monitor people's 'communications' to uncover terror threats . ‘But what we’ve also found is there is a degree of confusion and lack of transparency about the way in which this is authorised in our legal system. 'It is that lack of transparency that leads to people reaching the conclusion that there is blanket surveillance, indiscriminate surveillance.’ Another committee member, Tory MP Dr Julian Lewis, compared the process to using a magnet to pull a needle from a haystack. The agency does not have the ‘legal authority, the resources or the technical capability’ to intercept such vast amounts of material, the report concluded. The committee recommended a new law bringing together all the intelligence and security legislation. 'The allegation arising from the [Snowden] leaks is that GCHQ ‘hoover up’ and collect all internet communications. Some of those who gave evidence to this inquiry said ‘the agencies are monitoring the whole stream all the time’, referring to the ‘apparent ubiquity of surveillance’. 'We have explored whether this is the case. It is clear that both for legal reasons and due to resource constraints, it is not: GCHQ cannot conduct indiscriminate blanket interception of all communications. ‘It would be unlawful for them to do so, since it would not be necessary or proportionate, as required by [the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]. Moreover, GCHQ do not have the capacity to do so and can only cover a fraction of internet communications' Britain's spy agencies have to get a warrant to monitor an individual's emails, phone calls and other communications. The warrants are signed off by the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (left) or Home Secretary Theresa May (right) Shami Chakrabarti, director of rights campaign group Liberty, said the Parliamentary committee was 'clueless and ineffective' Councils were given more authorisations to access private communications data last year than GCHQ and MI6, it emerged last night. Town halls accessed records of telephone, text or internet use 2,110 times last year, the Interception of Communications Commissioner said. That compares to 1,291 approvals for GCHQ and 652 for MI6. MI5, which makes the vast bulk of such applications, was given 48,639 authorisations last year. Councils can use the powers to investigate fly tipping, benefit fraud, and trading standards ‘crimes’. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘The use by some town halls seems excessive – as if they were acting out their James Bond fantasies. I would encourage the press and public to investigate their actions further on why use is so high. ‘There is also a case for further tightening of these municipal snooping powers.’ Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, released 1.7million files in one of the biggest security leaks in US history. He fled to Russia, where he was granted asylum. Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, condemned the report, adding: ‘No doubt it would be simpler if we went along with the spies’ motto of “no scrutiny for us, no privacy for you” – but what an appalling deal for the British public.’ A Guardian spokesman said: ‘The Snowden revelations provoked a global debate about the role of intelligence and surveillance in the free world, and the extent to which it should be the subject of democratic and judicial oversight. Following the recent Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruling, it is now clear that the GCHQ and NSA mass surveillance programmes revealed by Snowden were illegal.’","Agents at GCHQ monitor 'large numbers of items' to uncover terror threats .

"A man who wears a nappy every day and has caused controversy for running a nursery for adults has appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show to defend his right to dress up as a baby. Derek Ventham, 52, and his wife Maxine appeared on the ITV show today to explain how the service they offer - and Derek's penchant for nappies - is not sexually motivated. Derek said: 'I'm like any other person, I get up, have breakfast and go to work. I have to wear a nappy all the time as I suffer from incontinence.' Scroll down for video . Derek Ventham appeared on today's Jeremy Kyle Show to talk about why he wears nappies . The 52-year-old, pictured wearing a nappy, said dressing up as a baby is not a sexual fetish. He said he wears nappies because he's incontinent and because he's 'fascinated' by them . However Derek admitted he would still wear a nappy if he didn't suffer from incontinence or wet the bed - because it's something he has done since he was a teenager. He explained: 'This was a liking I've had since I was seven, a fascination for nappies. It's not sexual.' Derek and Maxine now live in Liverpool where they run 'Nursery Thymes', a place where  adults can regress back to an infant-like state in which they wear nappies, have books read to them and even experience a nappy change. The couple had lived in Portsmouth but were forced to move after they were branded 'perverts' by their neighbours following Derek's appearance on Channel 4 documentary The 15-Stone Babies in 2012. Derek and his wife Maxine, right, run an adult nursery and told Kyle, left, on the show that 'don't force this on anyone, we keep it private and hidden' On the show, Derek had explained his love of dressing up and acting like a baby and was filmed having a nappy changed by his wife. He said on the show that people who call him a paedophile and a pervert have got his interest all wrong. He said: 'We don't want to be with children, we want to be the child.' Despite his recent TV appearances, Derek told Jeremy Kyle that they don't 'force this on anyone, we keep it private and hidden'. Maxine said they shouldn't be judged for their adult nursery which is used by people from all walks of life . Derek pictured dressed up as a baby on a Channel 4 documentary The 15-Stone Babies in 2012. He and Maxine had to move from their home in Portsmouth after the show aired because they were receiving abuse . They say business is booming at their adult nursery where customers are charged £75 an hour to play with toys, have nap time in adult-size cribs and dress up in nappies and children's clothes. There is a £25 surplus charge for a nappy change while staying overnight costs £350. 'Mummy Maxine' and 'Daddy Derek' explain on their website: 'We are nursery-thymes, we have been running our nursery for 14 years. We look after adult babies in our adult sized nursery, we look after you the way you want and cater your stay to the care you want. The couple's nursery where adults can dress up in children's clothes, left, and sit in a high chair, right . An overnight stay at Nursery Thymes with a night in a cot, pictured, costs £350 . 'Sitting in the high chair being fed by mummy or having your nappy changed in the big cot, we have lots of cuddly toys to play with, come along and relax in a warm friendly atmosphere, let us make your dreams come true. You must be over 18 too visit our nursery.' The couple say their clients come from all walks of life and some like to pretend to be a baby to get away from the stresses of everyday life. For others, the regression is a chance to deal with past childhood traumas. Maxine told Kyle: 'There is a stigma about what we do and people have an opinion and think you are a pervert. 'We are normal working people who happen to like to dress in a certain way, each to their own.'","Derek Ventham and his wife Maxine appeared on Jeremy Kyle Show .

"She had climbed the Great Wall of China, canoed down one of France's longest rivers and danced for more than a decade. And all this time, Karen MacLachlan had no idea she had a lethal, undiagnosed heart condition that could have killed her at any time. The self-confessed fitness fanatic was born with a heart defect that kills 90 per cent of babies before their first birthday if left undetected. The 25-year-old, from Glasgow, had no idea she had the deadly disease - which is usually diagnosed at birth - until her heart suddenly stopped beating. Ticking timebomb: Self-confessed fitness fanatic Karen MacLachlan had no idea she had a lethal, undiagnosed heart condition that could have killed her at any time . 'When I collapsed, my mum thought I'd tripped over,' she said. 'It wasn't until she heard a deathly rattling sound coming from my chest that she called an ambulance. 'She thought I was dead because my skin had turned a deathly black colour as I lay lifeless on the floor.' Ms MacLachlan was rushed to hospital and put into a medically induced coma. And remarkably, after surgery to rewire her heart, she has made a full recovery. Ms MacLachlan was diagnosed with Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery (ALCAPA). This is a rare heart condition where the main ventricle of the heart, which supplies oxygen to the body, is wired incorrectly. Usually, the condition is diagnosed at birth, but there is 90 per cent chance a patient will die from heart failure by the age of one if undetected. Ms MacLachlan said: 'At first, doctors believed my heart stopped as a result of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome not ALCAPA - it's very rare for someone to survive past infancy with it.' 'Doctors were amazed that I'd lived with this condition for so long and never had any problems before.' Indeed, she had always prided herself on being fit and healthy. 'Doctors asked if I'd struggled walking up hills, but I've walked the Great Wall of China - I'm really fit and active,' she said. 'I'd danced for 10 years, canoed one of the longest rivers in France and never had any symptoms, so it was a shock to everyone.' 'Even was taken aback because doctors told me I should have been so unwell, it was really scary. Danger: The self-confessed fitness fanatic was born with a heart defect that kills 90 per cent of babies before their first birthday if left undetected . 'It's terrifying as I now know I could have died at any moment.' Months after her collapse, Ms MacLachlan underwent corective open heart surgery. She then had a year of rehabilitation to get her heart used to even the most gentle exercise. She said: 'After doctors fixed my heart I was really poorly, I didn't realise how much the surgery would affect me. 'I couldn't walk four steps without sweating buckets like I normally do during strenuous exercise. 'I had to learn to build up my energy and became physically fit again. 'Every hour I'd have to walk one length of my parents' hallway to try and build my strength up. 'It hurt to sit down on sofas and I'd struggle to lift myself up because I didn't have enough energy to push myself up. 'Mentally it was pretty draining as well - at first I was scared to leave the house in case my heart stopped again. The 25-year-old said: 'When I collapsed, my mum thought I'd tripped over. It wasn't until she heard a deathly rattling sound coming from my chest that she called an ambulance' 'It took me a year to battle through everything but I've came out the other end independent and stronger again.' She now goes to the gym every day and takes the stairs everywhere she can. And she says she's glad she wasn't diagnosed any earlier. 'In some ways I'm glad I didn't know I had ALCAPA because I know I would have been wrapped up in cotton wool. If I knew about my condition I had this I don't think I would have gone off to climb mountains or go on adventure holidays. 'It took me a year to battle through everything but I've came out the other end independent and stronger again.' Since recovering, Ms MacLachlan has returned to a normal life but was keen to raise awareness of ALCAPA and other Congenital Heart problems. She has also bared her six-inch scar in a photography exhibition 'Scarred for Life' exhibition to raise awareness for the face behind heart problems. Unaware: Doctors were amazed she had lived with this condition for so long and never had any problems before. 'Doctors asked if I'd struggled walking up hills, but I've walked the Great Wall of China - I'm really fit and active,'  said Ms MacLachlan . Proud: After major surgery to re-wire her heart, Ms MacLachlan has been left with a six-inch. She has now bared this in the photography exhibition 'Scarred for Life' to raise awareness . Her picture joined those of seven other people who had pacemakers fitted and underwent heart surgery, at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, in Glasgow. She said: 'Before I would always hide my scar, it wasn't very nice to look at and it's taken me a while to reveal it. 'I never wanted people to ask about my scar or to notice it so I'd hide behind clothing that would cover me from my chest up to my neck. 'Since having my scar on show at the exhibition I feel like I can talk about it and I'm no longer ashamed of my mark. 'Having survived everything I've been through has made my love my scar. 'One little boy at the exhibit pointed at the picture of my scar and said to his mum that it was like his, which really warmed my heart. 'We really want to get people talking about heart conditions as we've nothing to be afraid of. 'Having revealed my scar I now feel so much more confident and for the first time wore a lower cut top last week. 'Now I feel strong enough to show it, the mark is a reminder of everything I've overcame.' ALCAPA is a rare heart condition you can be born with. Left undiagnosed, it kills in 90% of cases . June Davison, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'ALCAPA is a rare heart condition that you can be born with. 'Blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the left side of the heart, depriving the heart of oxygen, which can cause damage to the heart muscle. 'Surgery is needed to correct the condition and nowadays people with ALCAPA have a much better prognosis.' An 'ALCAPA (anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery) is a problem that occurs when the baby's heart is developing early in the pregnancy. The developing blood vessels in the heart do not connect correctly. In the normal heart, the left coronary artery starts in the aorta. The aorta is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. In children with ALCAPA, the left coronary artery starts at the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs. When this defect occurs, blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the left side of the heart. Therefore, the heart does not get enough oxygen. When the heart muscle is deprived of oxygen, the tissue begins to die. This condition leads to a heart attack in the baby. A condition known as 'coronary steal' further damages the heart in babies with ALCAPA. The low blood pressure in the pulmonary artery causes blood from the abnormal left coronary artery to flow toward the pulmonary artery instead of toward the heart. This results in less blood and oxygen to the heart. This problem will also lead to a heart attack in a baby. Coronary steal develops over time in babies with ALCAPA if the condition is not treated early. Source: Medline Plus .","Karen MacLachlan had no idea she had lethal, undiagnosed heart condition .

"Giant deer that once roamed the prehistoric British Isles were thought to have been wiped out towards the end of the Ice Age. But scientists have discovered that Irish elk lived on in Siberia for around 2,000 years after it was presumed they had gone extinct. Tests on bones found scattered across the frozen Russian wilderness are rewriting the evolutionary history of the animal, which stood seven feet (two metres) tall and had majestic antlers with a 10 foot (three-metre) span. Scientists have discovered that the Irish elk lived on in Siberia for around 2,000 years after it was presumed to have become extinct. This image shows the skull of the large moose- like animal . It had been assumed previously the moose-like animal, which was prevalent in Ireland and parts of continental Europe, was wiped out around 10,300 years ago along with the likes of sabre-tooth cats and giant sloths. But tests carried out on remains have concluded that not only did the species travel to the other side of the world, but also survived for at least another two millennia. Analysis of bones unearthed in Western Siberia revealed they are just 8,800 years old and date back to about 6,800BC. Dr Yaroslav Kuzmin, a Senior Researcher at the Institute of Geology and Mineralogy in Siberia, said the discovery will ‘significantly update’ theories on the deer's extinction, The Siberian Times reported. It had been assumed previously the moose-like animal (illustrated), which was prevalent in Ireland and parts of continental Europe, was wiped out around 10,300 years ago along with  sabre-tooth cats and giant sloths . It was thought that the last habitat of the species was in western and north Europe, including the British Isles and Scandinavia, 10,300 years ago (marked on the map at 1), but new analysis has shown that another population lived on in Western Siberia between 8,800 and 7,900 years ago (marked at 3) ‘Previously we knew that the population of the giant deer was being dramatically reduced from about 12,000 years ago,’ he said. ‘It was also known that the last habitat of the species in western and north Europe, including the British Isles and Scandinavia, was about 10,300 years ago. ‘But now we have shown that there were at least two habitats: the European and Siberian.’ A distant relative of the modern-day fallow deer, the Irish elk was a giant animal that lived solely on vegetation. Tests on bones found scattered across the frozen Russian wilderness are re-writing the evolutionary history of the animal, which stood seven feet (two metres) tall and had majestic antlers with a 10 foot (three metre) span. A skeleton is shown left and diagram illustrating its height, right . Existence of Irish elks first became apparent in the 17th and 18th centuries when scientists realised that fossilised specimens did not belong to any living creature on Earth. An antler from a giant deer is shown . Neither an elk nor exclusive to Ireland, it was given its name because the most well-preserved fossils were located in peat bogs in the country. Their existence first became apparent in the 17th and 18th centuries when scientists realised that fossilised specimens did not belong to any living creature on Earth. Various studies concluded they became prevalent in Europe and parts of Asia and Africa. A set of remains found in 1886 near Yekaterinburg, in the Urals region of Russia, were analysed in 2004 by Dr Anthony Stuart, who is now at Durham University. His team said they believed they dated back 7,500 years. That theory has now been confirmed by new tests on other bones and fossils uncovered across Siberia over the past 15 years. A distant relative of the modern-day fallow deer, the Irish elk was a giant animal that lived solely on vegetation. A fossil of its upper jaw bone is shown . The next step for the scientists in Russia is to compile data on every set of giant deer remains found in Siberia to see if that can provide further clues to the animal's evolution. A skeleton is shown . Among the remains examined as part of the new research were fragments of antlers discovered in Baraba steppe, in Western Siberia, and a jaw complete with teeth in a burial ground called Preobrazhenka 6 in the same region. Both sets were found to be between 8,800 and 8,900 years old. It means the Irish elk, presumed to have become extinct in Europe, was alive and well in Siberia thousands of years later. The findings are published in the April edition of the journal, Quaternary Science Reviews. The next step for the scientists in Russia is to compile data on every set of giant deer remains found in Siberia to see if that can provide further clues to the animal's evolution. Dr Kuzmin said: ‘We do not know if the Siberian habitat was continuous or consisted of two separate sub-habitats: one in central Western Siberia and the Trans-Urals, and a second one in the middle course of the Angara River. ‘We need somehow to fill in the gaps in our knowledge about the giant deer habitat and its migration and so on.’ A huge step towards recreating the woolly mammoth has been taken by scientists who inserted more than a dozen of its genes into the live DNA of an elephant. Researchers studied the structure of DNA from mammoths preserved in the Arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal’s genes. These were then integrated by experts at Harvard University in Massachusetts into the elephant genome - and functioned as normal DNA. Recreation: Researchers studied the structure of DNA from woolly mammoths (file illustration) preserved in the Arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal’s genes . A new method known as 'Crispr' - helping scientists make accurate changes to DNA - was used by genetics professor George Church, who replaced parts of elephant DNA with the mammoth genes. He said: ‘We prioritised genes associated with cold resistance including hairiness, ear size, subcutaneous fat and, especially, haemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen around the body).’ ‘De-extinction’ enthusiast Mr Church, who was speaking to The Sunday Times science editor Jonathan Leake, added: ‘We now have functioning elephant cells with mammoth DNA in them.’","Irish elk were thought to have been wiped out during the Ice Age .

"Malcolm Fraser adored the Whitney Houston film The Bodyguard, pigged out eating ice cream straight from the tub and would boast to his grandkids about his huge Twitter following. That's according to the former prime minister's granddaughter, Rachael Fraser, who delivered a loving tribute to her grandfather at a funeral service in Melbourne on Friday. Ms Fraser told mourners, including prime ministers past and present, that her much-loved granddad was a 'great leader' for the country but also a 'joker at heart' who put his kids and grandkids first. 'A few years ago, grandad was intrigued as to why all his grandchildren were taking photos and constantly checking their phones,' a composed Ms Fraser said. 'After a few long conversations about both Twitter and Facebook at, the age of 81 grandad seemed to have his accounts up and running in no time and became more active than all of us put together. 'I still remember the cheeky grin on his face when he said ""I've got 20,000 followers, how many do you have, Rach?"" 'This is only a few months after having his Twitter account.' Ms Fraser told mourners that he treasured his family deeply and had a way of embracing anything his children and grandchildren were passionate about, whether that be farming, horses, surfing or teaching.

'Grandad treasured moments when the family were together. He would often take photos and create collages that he would send around to each of us to keep hold of. 'He also loved Christmas time, and at every Christmas dinner I always wanted to open the presents early and to convince the rest of the family grandad was by best bet. 'Once I had him on side it was harder for granny to say no. Grandad was always happy to talk no matter what time of day it was. 'At one point a few weeks ago, I called grandad at 10pm as I had to make a difficult decision. 'He was reading next to granny at the time, however, that didn't stop either of them from listening and picking up the phone.' 'Grandad gave me just enough advice so that the decision still had to be made myself, but I felt more content in doing so. 'Grandad's favourite film was 'The Bodyguard' because of Whitney Houston and every time I stayed with him he would ask granny and I if we wanted to watch it, as if we had never seen it before.' Liberal MP Ewen Jones was among those who praised Ms Fraser's speech. '(It) was just brilliant,' he tweeted. 'Makes you proud to hear it, let alone know the family'. Two of Mr Fraser's children, Hugh and Phoebe, and his parliamentary colleague Peter Nixon also addressed the service. ''He loved Australia,' Hugh said. 'He was not merely one of its sons, but one of it's most fervent custodians. i feel the world is slightly less safe now.' Mr Nixon recalled Mr Fraser's considerable achievements as prime minister from 1975 to 1983, including opening the country to Vietnamese migrants and introducing Freedom of Information laws.

"Professor Simon Wessely warned authorities against a knee-jerk reaction to Tuesday's Germanwings crash and said pilots with a history of depression - like co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (above) - should not immediately be banned from flying commercial jets . Pilots with a history of depression should not be banned from flying commercial jets, a leading British psychiatrist has claimed. Professor Simon Wessely warned authorities against a knee-jerk reaction to Tuesday's Germanwings crash. He made the comments after it was revealed co-pilot Andreas Lubitz suffered from mental health issues and may have been receiving treatment for vision problems before he deliberately crashed the Airbus A320, killing all 150 people on board. Around 100 commercial pilots in the UK have a history of depression with 42 currently on medication, The Observer reported. Prof Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the aviation industry should not rush to change the rules. He cited the response by health authorities to the crimes of Dr Harold Shipman, who is thought to have killed between 215 and 260 of his patients, as an example of ineffective policy. He said: 'It is not a good idea to rush. It is like the response to Shipman - an utterly bizarre and unpredictable event is not a good basis of policy. 'The procedures that they then brought in would not have prevented Shipman. 'What does cause trouble is saying that if you ever have a history of depression then you should not be allowed to do whatever. That is wrong, as much as saying that people with a history of broken arms shouldn't be allowed to do something.' Prof Wessely also stressed there was not a link between depression and aggressive suicide. But a father of one of the three Britons killed has called for more to be done to see pilots were 'looked after'. Prof Wessely also stressed there was not a link between depression and aggressive suicide. Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane into the French Alps after locking his captain out of the cockpit . Rescue workers inspect debris from the Germanwings jet at the crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes . Philip Bramley, whose son Paul, 28, was on the flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, said: 'I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly. 'We put our lives and our children's lives in their hands.' Questions continue to be asked about Lubitz's mental and physical health days after he locked the captain out of the  cockpit and brought down the airliner. Authorities have already revealed he hid  a sick note declaring him unfit to work from his employers on the day of the disaster. Evidence found at his home suggested he was suffering from a 'serious psychosomatic illness', police said. Officers reportedly found a variety of drugs used to treat mental illness at his flat in Dusseldorf, appearing to substantiate claims he was severely depressed. According to German newspaper Bild the 27-year-old also previously told an ex-girlfriend: 'One day I will do something that will change the whole system and then all will know my name and remember it.'

"The first man struck in Marion 'Suge' Knight's deadly hit-and-run later told officers that he physically assaulted the former rap mogul before the confrontation, a police report reveals. 'I f***** him up!' Cle 'Bone' Sloan, a former gang member, told the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, according to the documents. Sloan reportedly admitted to attacking Knight, the 49-year-old co-founder of Death Row records, as he lay in a hospital bed suffering from multiple head wounds. Terry Carter, a 55-year-old father, was the second man to be hit by Knight's truck. He died from the injuries he sustained. Scroll down for video . Marion 'Suge' Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder after a hit-and-run incident on January 29 in a Compton, California, parking lot. His lawyer Matthew Fletcher, pictured left on March 9, has said that 'There's no reason Mr Knight should be in jail' Cle 'Bone' Sloan (left) and Terry Carter (right) were the victims of the hit-and-run. Carter died of his injuries, while Sloan is recovering and allegedly told police that he 'f***** up' Knight before being run over . Sloan, 51, allegedly said that he had a verbal dispute on January 29 with Knight three miles away from the scene of the hit-and-run, according to the New York Daily News. It is believed to have been a result of an argument 30 minutes before between Knight and others on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton.' He then allegedly headed straight for Knight when he saw him at Tam's Burgers in Compton, California, - the location of the hit-and-run - about half an hour later. 'Sloan said he contacted Knight and began to punch him through the driver side window,' the report read. 'Sloan stated Knight tried to exit the red Ford but was stopped by his punches.' Sloan was walking away when he heard someone say, 'Look out', according to his account to the police. He said he was trying to turn around but was then struck by Knight's Ford F-150 Raptor. Knight's lawyer told the Daily News that Sloan had initiated both confrontations and that the former rapper never left his car. 'Sloan is trying to exculpate himself but all the while he's just killing himself. It's monumental,' lawyer Matthew Fletcher told Daily News. Knight (pictured on March 9, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and is in jail without bail. His lawyer Fletcher has said that Knight never exited the vehicle and was acting in self defense .

Suge never exited his vehicle. He was accosted by Sloan who challenged him to fight,' he added. Fletcher had previously said that Knight was acting in self defense to get away from what he thought was an armed assault. Carter made a one-minute call to Knight at 2.36pm the day of the incidents, phone records included in the police report said. Nineteen minutes later, police were called to Tam's about the alleged hit-and-run. Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder, but he pleaded not guilty and is in jail without bail. Though prosecutors claim Knight intentionally hit Sloan and Carter with his truck, Fletcher believes 'There's no reason Mr Knight should be in jail'. 'Sloan's own words probe he drove across the entire city of Compton in order to have a confrontation with Mr Knight,' Fletcher told the Daily News.

"He's the man who's reached the tops of Kilimanjaro, led treks to Mount Everest and completed The Kokoda Trail. Now Sydney-based Joe Bonington is training ordinary Aussies to do exactly the same and cross these expeditions off their adventure bucket list. The 47-year-old adventure trainer shares how his father, British mountaineering legend Sir Chris Bonington, helped turn his troubled life around and experience the unforgettable feeling of achieving what he once thought was impossible.

The Sydney-based man is training ordinary Aussies conquer the world's toughest mountains and walking trails . Mr Bonington, who runs Joe's Basecamp in Brookvale on Sydney's Northern Beaches, says he saw the change in himself the moment he reached the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. 'I had quite a troubled childhood - my father was quite famous at the time,' Mr Bonington told Daily Mail Australia. 'I went off the rails a bit and got into a bit of trouble because I was sick of people asking me if I was going to follow in my father's footsteps. 'I guess when I was young, I kind of wanted to make my own mark and also couldn't really understand why my dad spent days away on these trips. 'I was always scared that he was going to get killed - like all his friends did. It was quite hard for a young kid to digest.' At the age of 24,  he embarked on his very first expedition with the help of his father. 'That year I decided to go on my first expedition and it absolutely changed my life,' Mr Bonington said.

I remember seeing my dad crying his eyes out as I went off on my own. 'When I reached the top, I just burst into tears. I just stood there crying because I finally understood why my dad did what he does. 'I learnt that yes there are risks but what you get from these experiences just outweighs everything else. 'That first experience taught me that I need to get out of my comfort zone and I've been doing that ever since. I'm now teaching others to do the same.' Having completed The Kokoda Trail in 2004, climbed to Everest base camp in 2008 and 2010 - with plans to go again next year with his clients - Mr Bonington says his most memorable adventure was in 2000.

'That's when I went up an unclimbed peak with my dad in a remote part of Nepal,' he said. 'To stand at the top of a peak that nobody has ever stood before - and to be there with my dad - it was truly an emotional moment.' And while Mr Bonington is all about expanding people's horizons by training them for mountain climbing, desert marathons and long distance treks - he also hopes this helps others to 'get more out of life'. 'What we often forget is that we live in a stunning world and we need to get out there to see it,' he said. 'My clients are not professional athletes.

The personal trainer says witnessing how he can transform people's perspective on their lives is simply priceless. 'For me, I love seeing the look on people's faces when they come to understand what they're capable of achieving,' he said. 'Seeing people doing things that they never thought they could do and seeing their smile when they reach the end - it's really amazing.

"If a column in honor of heart health suggests a can of Coke as a snack, you might want to read the fine print. The world's biggest beverage maker, which struggles with declining soda consumption in the U.S., is working with fitness and nutrition experts who suggest its cola as a healthy treat. In February, for instance, several wrote online pieces for American Heart Month, with each including a mini-can of Coke or small soda as a snack idea. The mentions — which appeared on nutrition blogs and other sites including those of major newspapers — show the many ways food companies work behind the scenes to cast their products in a positive light, often with the help of third parties who are seen as trusted authorities. Challenges: Coca-Cola, which struggles with declining soda consumption in the U.S., is working with fitness and nutrition experts who suggest its cola as a healthy treat (file photo) Ben Sheidler, a Coca-Cola spokesman, compared the February posts to product placement deals a company might have with TV shows. 'We have a network of dietitians we work with,' said Sheidler, who declined to say how much the company pays experts. 'Every big brand works with bloggers or has paid talent.' Other companies including Kellogg and General Mills have used strategies like providing continuing education classes for dietitians, funding studies that burnish the nutritional images of their products and offering newsletters for health experts. PepsiCo Inc. has also worked with dietitians who suggest its Frito-Lay and Tostito chips in local TV segments on healthy eating. Others use nutrition experts in sponsored content; the American Pistachio Growers has quoted a dietitian for the New England Patriots in a piece on healthy snacks and recipes and Nestle has quoted its own executive in a post about infant nutrition. For Coca-Cola Co., the public relations strategy with health experts in February focused on the theme of 'Heart Health & Black History Month.' The effort yielded a radio segment and multiple online pieces. One post refers to a 'refreshing beverage option such as a mini can of Coca-Cola.' Another suggests 'portion-controlled versions of your favorites, like Coca-Cola mini cans, packs of almonds or pre-portioned desserts for a meal.' The focus on the smaller cans isn't surprising. Sugary drinks have come under fire for fueling obesity rates and related ills, and the last time Coke's annual U.S. soda volume increased was in 2002, according to the industry tracker Beverage Digest. More recently, the company is pushing its mini-cans as a guilt-free way to enjoy cola. The cans also fetch higher prices on a per ounce basis, so even if people are drinking less soda, Coke says it can grow sales. In a statement, Coca-Cola said it wants to 'help people make decisions that are right for them' and that like others in the industry, it works with health experts 'to help bring context to the latest facts and science around our products and ingredients.' It said any communications by the experts it works with contain the appropriate disclosures. Most of the pieces suggesting mini-Cokes say in the bios that the author is a 'consultant' for food companies, including Coca-Cola. Some add that the ideas expressed are their own.  One column is marked at the bottom as a 'sponsored article,' which is an ad designed to look like a regular story. It ran on more than 1,000 sites, including those of major news outlets around the country. The other posts were not marked as sponsored content, but follow a similar format. Ben Sheidler, a Coca-Cola spokesman, has compared the February posts - which mentioned a mini-can of Coke or small soda as a snack idea -  to product placement deals a company might have with TV shows (file) Kelly McBride, who teaches media ethics at The Poynter Institute, said the phrasing of the disclosure that the author is a 'consultant' for food companies, including Coca-Cola, doesn't make it clear the author was specifically paid by Coke for the column. 'This is an example of opaque sponsored content,' McBride said. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a professional group for dietitians, says in its code of ethics that practitioners promote and endorse products 'only in a manner that is not false and misleading.' A spokesman for the academy did not respond when asked if the posts on mini-Cokes meet those guidelines. Meanwhile, a group called Dietitians for Professional Integrity has called for sharper lines to be drawn between dietitians and companies. Andy Bellatti, one of its founders, said companies court dietitians because they help validate corporate messages. The message that Coke can be a healthy snack is debatable. Alice Lichtenstein, a professor of nutrition science and policy at Tufts University and a member of the nutrition committee at the American Heart Association, said a smaller can of soda might be a 'move in the right direction' for someone who regularly drinks soda. Still, she wouldn't recommend soda as a snack. The health experts who wrote the pieces mentioning Coke stand by their recommendations. Robyn Flipse, the dietitian who wrote the sponsored article for Coke, said she would suggest mini-cans of Coke even if she wasn't being paid. Although she doesn't drink soda herself, she said the smaller cans are a way for people who like soda to enjoy it sensibly. 'I absolutely think that I provided valuable information,' she said. Flipse said the idea to mention mini-cans of Coke in the post was hers and came about after a public relations agency for Coke suggested a piece on heart health and asked what she might 'work in.' Flipse has worked with Coca-Cola and the American Beverage Association for years; her roles have included sending out messages on social media refuting the idea that sugary drinks are to blame for obesity and making herself available as an expert for news outlets. If a story says something negative about artificial sweeteners, Flipse said she might contact the PR agency and ask, 'Do you want me to do something about that?' Sylvia Melendez-Klinger, a dietitian who wrote another piece mentioning mini- cans of soda, said it's important that health professionals share their expertise with companies and that her work reflects her own views. She said she could not recall if she was paid for her article mentioning mini-sodas.","Coca-Cola  is working with fitness and nutrition experts who suggest its cola as a healthy treat .

"Nick Clegg today challenged the Tories come clean about where the axe will fall, just 24 hours after the coalition ended. The Lib Dem leader accused David Cameron and George Osborne of 'trying to pull the wool over your eyes' by promising to protect the NHS without spelling out how he will pay for it. He said that only the Lib Dems have promised to find the £8billion which NHS chiefs say will be needed by 2020, and how the money will be found. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who tried his hand at making pancakes at a Panasonic Manufacturing site in Cardiff, took aim at Chancellor George Osborne, who spent the day making making dough at a Pizza Express in Hove . Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, has warned that by the end of the decade the health service will need an extra £8billion-a-year. Mr Clegg boasted that he would ensure the NHS got the money, but he said Labour had not made that pledge and the Tories 'try to give the impression they have, but they haven't'. At an election campaign press conference at the National Liberal Club in central London he said: 'We know the Conservatives won't ask the wealthiest to pay a penny more so every spending commitment they make has to be met by deeper and deeper cuts elsewhere. 'So, George Osborne, Jeremy Hunt - where will the axe fall? Soldiers, schools social workers? The only people the Tories have said they will protect are their friends in big business and in big houses. 'The Conservatives are trying to pull the wool over your eyes by not telling you how they will give the NHS the resources it needs.' Mr Osborne was visiting Hove on the south coast as a row raged over spending cuts planned after the election . The Tories have promised to give the NHS the money it needs, but the Lib Dems say they have not been clear about where the money will come from . Mr Clegg added: 'The dividing lines of this election are becoming clearer by the day. The Conservatives will cut too much, Labour will borrow too much. Excessive cuts or excessive borrowing. It's a dismal choice. 'What you want is a balanced budget and stronger public services. That's what the Liberal Democrats offer.' The Lib Dems were the first to publicly commit to providing 'in full' the extra £8 billion a year the NHS boss says it needs by 2020. The party promises to repeat the £2 billion annual 'down payment' announced by Mr Osborne each year to 2020 and add £1 billion from a tax squeeze on high earners and ending the Conservative 'shares for rights' policy. But the bulk of the extra is slated to come from increasing public spending in line with economic growth after eliminating the structural deficit in 2017-18. Mr Clegg used a press conference at the National Liberal Club to claim only the Lib Dems have spelt out how to fund £8billion extra for the NHS . Mr Clegg said the Liberal Democrats would be 'pretty specific' about exactly where the party's preferred tax rises would hit by the time voters go to the polls . The Lib Dems today pledged an extra £2.5billion for mental health care to end 'decades of institutionalised discrimination' in the NHS. Nick Clegg said his party had proved they were serious about the issue by campaigning 'remorselessly' in government for improved services, with some success. Some £250 million over five years will be spent on services for pregnant women and mothers dealing with depression. This would include eight new mother and baby units providing inpatient care and 40 new community services helping new mothers adjust to life at home with a newborn. New waiting time standards will be introduced for people in crisis and for conditions like bipolar disorder so that those who are ill know how long they have to wait. The funding would also mean hundreds of thousands more people will get access to talking therapies for anxiety and depression. A commitment to boost funding for health, with a particular focus on mental health, will be on the front page of the Lib Dem election manifesto, indicating it will be a key priority in any coalition talks after the General Election. Felicity Dormon, senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation charity, said well-targeted extra funding for mental health could improve the quality of NHS care but questioned what other areas of health would lose cash as a result. However, this raises questions about what happens if the economy does not grow as rapidly as hoped. Mr Clegg said it was 'perfectly legitimate' to base policy on current projections. 'You can only operate on a set of assumptions. That's what any economist does. Since I can't tell you precisely in the future what is going to happen, I can tell you that we base our plans on the predictions that are given independently by the Office of Budget Responsibility,' he said. Asked what the plan would be if growth was slower, he said: 'Well, what do I do if the world comes to an end next Tuesday? 'The greatest threat to ongoing growth in the British economy is that we don't continue the balanced approach to fiscal consolidation and maintain the stability which has led to far greater growth than many predicted.' Mr Clegg went on: 'Ed Miliband, David Cameron, it's time to come clean: will you or will you not give the NHS the £8 billion a year by 2020 that it needs and tell us how you plan to fund it? 'The Liberal Democrats have. If you care about the NHS as much as you claim to, you should too.' Mr Clegg said the Liberal Democrats would be 'pretty specific' about exactly where the party's preferred tax rises would fall by the time voters go to the polls. It says £6 billion of the cost of balancing the books should come from increased tax - with the same sum found from a clampdown on tax dodgers, £12 billion in Whitehall cuts and around £3.5 from a squeeze on welfare. 'I accept the challenge that we should show how that £6 billion is arrived at in additional taxes but I think we have already provided far more detail than any other party in the early stages of this election campaign,' Mr Clegg said. 'On taxes we will be pretty specific.'","Lib Dem leader rounds on Tories 24 hours after the coalition ended .

"Seven Southwestern states will soon be infiltrated by 1,200 military special ops personnel as part of a controversial domestic military training in which some of the elite soldiers will operate undetected among civilians. Operation Jade Helm begins in July and will last for eight weeks. Soldiers will operate in and around towns in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah and Colorado where some of them wil drop from planes while carrying weapons loaded with blanks in what military officials have dubbed Realistic Military Training. But with residents of the entire states of Texas and Utah dubbed 'hostile' for the purposes of the exercises, Jade Helm has some concerned the drills are too realistic. Scroll down for video . Hostile: An unclassified military document reveals the states involved in a controversial multi-agency training exercises that will place 1,200 military personnel into 7 Southwest states--with residents of Utah, Texas and part of Southern California designated as 'hostile' Special ops: Operation Jade Helm will involve Green Berets and SEALs and special forces from the Air Force and Marines starting in July and lasting 8 weeks . Headlines like Freedom Outpost's 'Operation Jade Helm—military trains for martial law in American South-west' abound across the Right-leaning blogosphere and Info Wars warns that Jade Helm is simply 'an effort to test the effectiveness of infiltration techniques' on the American public. 'They're having Delta Force, Navy SEALS with the Army trained to basically take over,' Info Wars' Alex Jones said Sunday. 'Texas is listed as a hostile sector, and of course, we are...We're here defending the republic.' The Houston Chronicle reports that, among the planned exercises, soldiers will attempt to operate undetected among civilian populations. Residents, in turn, will be asked to report suspicious activity in order to gauge the effectiveness of the soldiers. Military officials say they've gotten the go ahead for the operations from local authorities such as mayors and county commissions. And sheriff's deputies told the Houston Chronicle they would ensure residents living near where aircraft were slated to create disturbances and drop soldiers, civilian and military vehicles will barrel through and where blank rounds would be fired. Jim Stewart with the Brazos County, Texas Sheriff's Office told the Chronicle that such exercises are far from anything new. 'Special ops for years have trained off-post for years, where they go out and have folks that are role players out on the economy,' said the Army intelligence veteran. 'They'll have a scenario they'll be following and they'll interact with these role players as if they're in another country.' However, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command themselves say Jade Helm is different. See more at KEYE-TV . Reassuring?

Texas, which the military has designated as 'hostile' for the purposes of the training, was chosen to be a hub of the unprecedentedly large program because 'Texans are historically supportive of efforts to prepare our soldiers' writes the USASOC . 'The size and scope of Jade Helm sets this one apart. To stay ahead of the environmental challenges faced overseas, Jade Helm will take place across seven states,' the USASOC wrote in a March 24 release. 'The diverse terrain in these states replicates areas Special Operations Soldiers regularly find themselves operating in overseas.' The military has also reacted to widespread fear of the operation by calling some ultra-conservative coverage of the 'martial law' drills alarmist and inaccurate. 'That notion was proposed by a few individuals who are unfamiliar with how and why USASOC conducts training exercises,' USASOC spokesman Army Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria told Stripes. 'This exercise is routine training to maintain a high level of readiness for Army Special Operations Forces because they must be ready to support potential missions anywhere in the world on a moment's notice.'

"Ruling: Mr Justice Mostyn said today a millionaire sperm donor must pay £20,000 to cover the legal costs of the lesbian couple in a row over access to the seven-year-old boy . The millionaire gay father of a child brought up by a lesbian couple he donated sperm to must pay £20,000 to cover their costs in an extraordinary triangular legal battle between the boy's three parents. The man - named in High Court papers as JF - helped the women have a child in 2007 but the mothers now say he is being too demanding over access to the seven-year-old. After the boy was born JF - who has dual British and US citizenship and lives in a £1.2million pound home in the South of England - had irregular contact with him and took him to America twice. But his relationship broke down with the mothers, who complained that the father had become 'increasingly individualistic and demanding about contact', the court heard. Today Mr Justice Mostyn - one of Britain's most senior family judges - ruled that in the absence of legal aid JF must pay 80 per cent of the mothers' costs as they continue to fight him in court. The judge blamed the Government's 'grossly unfair' legal aid cuts that mean the father should have to pay £20,596 now, and 80 per cent of future costs run up by the women, known as MG and JG. 'But that it where the Government has left him. It is a sorry state of affairs,' added the judge. The boy's mothers,  who live in the North of England and are known only as MG, now 35, and JG, now 45, met in in 2005 and entered a civil partnership in July 2006. They wanted a child and responded to an entry by JF in a register for 'lesbian women and gay men seeking a non-sexual parenting partner' and accepted his sperm so they could have a child. MG carried the baby and gave birth in April 2007 and the couple agreed that JG became a legal step-parent and it was agreed all three would have legal rights to the boy - JFG - who was registered as an American citizen. Until October 2012 JF enjoyed periodic contact with his son and had even taken him to America with the two mothers on a couple of occasions. Turned sour: The seven-year-old boy is now at the centre of a bitter and expensive legal battle between his parents . In December 2013 JF issued an application in the High Court for more regular contact with his son, sparking an ongoing legal battle with the lesbian couple, who have since split up and run out of money. During eight court hearings legal costs have built up and the mothers have extended their mortgage to pay for it. But with 'modest means' they cannot afford any more. The judge said 'unfortunately' in April 2014 the two mothers separated but continue to work together in court. Under the old system both would have been entitled to legal aid, said the judge. But in April 2013 the Legal Aid, Sentence and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 ( LASPO) came into force. It removed legal aid from private law children proceedings and 'at a stroke, 63 years of state funding of cases such as this was swept away,' said the judge. Mr Justice Mostyn said: 'With the state washing its hands of MG and JG they now look to JF to fund their representation.' He said although the barristers in the case had reduced their fees they could not be expected to work for nothing. He added: 'So even though it cannot be said that JF has behaved reprehensibly or unreasonably he is the only realistic source of costs funding, subject to whatever contribution MG and JG should make from their own very limited resources. Some may say (and have said) that this is grossly unjust; I myself refrain from comment.' He said: 'Even though MG and JG are certainly not entitled to an order for costs they are entitled to seek an order for costs funding. To JF that may seem (with reason) to be a specious distinction without a difference, but that is where we find ourselves, now that the fourth pillar of the welfare state has been largely demolished.' Now the father must pay more than £20,000 to the women the High Court battle will continue, with a ruling over access now likely later this year. An Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Legal aid is a vital part of our justice system but resources are not limitless. At the time legal aid reform began not only had this Government inherited an unprecedented financial crisis but our legal aid bill was one of the most expensive in the world at around £2billion a year. 'We want to make sure family cases happen in the least divisive way possible, which is why we encourage people to use mediation and other out of court options that we know are less stressful and confrontational than going to court - and as a result are often more successful. 'It's for this reason we've significantly increased mediation funding and also recently announced new measures to give better support to those who decide to go to court and represent themselves. 'In some cases, though, court clearly is the only answer which is why, even after reform, we will still have one of the most generous legal aid system at around £1.5 billion a year.'","The sperm donor - known as JF - helped two women have a child in 2007 .
Since then the father has become more 'demanding' over access, court told .
The mothers are fighting his access claim but have run out of money .
Senior High Court judge rules that father should pay 80% of their costs .
Mr Justice Mostyn says it is 'grossly unfair' and blames legal aid cuts .
Legal battle can now continue with ruling on access likely later this year ."
"From Dame Vera Lynn to Ella Fitzgerald they are some of the nation’s best loved singers. But their music offers more than just relaxation. According to Dame Esther Rantzen, songs from a bygone age can benefit the emotional and mental health of older people by reminding them of the loves and dreams of their past. With this in mind she has collaborated on an album of music from the 1940s to the 1970s titled Silver Linings, Songs of a Lifetime. Dame Esther Rantzen believes songs from a bygone age can benefit the health of older people and has collaborated on an album of 1940s to 1970s music, featuring Dame Vera Lynn (left) and Ella Fitzgerald (right) The music on the £12 Silver Linings, Songs of a Lifetime album (pictured above), which is being sold by Amazon, HMV and iTunes, was chosen by Dame Esther and those who benefit from The Silver Line charity . Tom Jones, Dame Vera Lynn, Petula Clark, Ella Fitzgerald and Dionne Warwick are just some of the artists who feature on the compilation which has been created to generate funds for Dame Esther’s Silver Line helpline. Launched in 2013 for the lonely elderly, volunteers are now taking up to 1,000 calls a day and £1 from every album sale will go towards providing much needed funds for the charity. The former That’s Life! Presenter who is now 74 said yesterday: ‘Listening to the music of our youth - which reminds us of the time we dreamed, fell in love, went out with friends, the world was in front of us and nothing seemed impossible - makes us feel young. ‘It has been found to turn the clock back, physically, mentally and emotionally. So it’s really good for us.’ The music on the £12 album, which is being sold by Amazon, HMV and iTunes, was chosen by Dame Esther and the people who benefit from The Silver Line. Former That’s Life! Presenter, Dame Esther Rantzen (pictured) believes music from a bygone age can help benefit the  mental health of older people . Among them is 93-year-old Bob Lowe, who moved Radio 5 Live listeners to tears last year after sharing a poem that he wrote to his late wife Kath following her death from Alzheimer’s. In their youth Mr and Mrs Lowe danced to many of the songs on the album. A black and white image on its cover captures the couple dancing in high spirits. The music on the album is also a soundtrack to Dame Esther’s life and she shares one of her memories, involving her former husband Desmond Wilcox who died from heart disease in 2010, on the sleeve notes: ‘Ella [Fitzgerald] singing Every Time We Say Goodbye is a lovely but sad ballad, expressing the pangs of parting. 'My late husband, Desmond, used to sing it to me when he had to leave, but as he was completely tone-deaf, we used to dissolve into laughter, and that eased the pain and gave us a joyous memory, until we met again. ‘And Up, Up and Away [by The Fifth Dimension] always reminds me of the balloon flight he gave me as a birthday gift, when I flew so fast in a beautiful balloon that we landed with a crash in a bramble bush. 'You, too, will have so many personal memories as you listen to this collection, of tears and laughter.’ Dame Esther’s relationship with Mr Wilcox began as an affair in 1968, when they both worked at the BBC. They married in 1977, had three children and spent 30 years together until his death, aged 69. Three years ago, after her youngest child Joshua moved out, Dame Esther sold the family home and moved into a two-bedroom flat. At the age of 71 she found herself living alone, and the experience prompted her to set up The Silver Line. Tom Jones (left), Petula Clark (right) and Dionne Warwick are also among artists who feature on the album . Music by Dionne Warwick (pictured in 2013) also features on the album which is being sold by Amazon, HMV and iTunes. All proceeds from the £12 compilation will go towards Dame Esther’s Silver Line helpline charity . Last year Dame Esther said: 'I was coming home to a dark flat with no one to make a cup of tea with and no one to ask about my day, it hit me quite profoundly. 'When I started to talk about it working in the elderly care sector, I realised how it resonated with so many hundreds of thousands of people. 'One of the things I discovered was the stigma attached to loneliness, people don't like admitting it, partly because they don't want to be a burden, and partly because they're ashamed, they feel humiliated by this feeling nobody wants them or cares about them. 'So there is a pride and an independence in the older generation. We want them to know that they're not alone and that we do care.'","Dame Esther Rantzen has created compilation of songs from a bygone age .

"A schoolgirl who was arrested by armed officers and held in a cell overnight says she was targeted because police mistook an afro-comb she was carrying for a gun. Rochae Davis says she was walking with friends in Croydon, south London, with the comb tucked into the waistband of her trousers. Police already on their way to the scene were alerted to CCTV footage which they say purported to show the 15-year-old carrying a gun and later arrested her at home. Rochae Davis, 15, pictured with her mother Simone, says she was arrested by armed police because they mistook an afro-comb tucked into her waistband for a gun . She was bailed without charge and must return to a police station in April as the investigation continues. But, with police yet to recover a weapon, the schoolgirl claims she was only arrested because police jumped to conclusions. 'As I was walking back with a friend, six police officers from Trident, the gun crime unit arrived, and had guns. They pushed us against a wall and searched us,' she said. 'It was only after they had finished that they said they had seen me on CCTV with a firearm. But it was an afro comb - it didn't look anything like a gun. 'I was scared and confused. I said I didn't have a gun, but it was so unfair, they wouldn't hear me out. 'I didn't know what was happening. They took my clothes and my stuff - it was really uncomfortable.' Rochae's mother, Simone, said police's treatment of her daughter had been 'a disgrace' and that the schoolgirl had 'never been in trouble' with the law before. The schoolgirl said she 'didn't know what was happening' when she was taken to a police station and held overnight. Officers did not find the comb (above) when they searched her house as, she says, she had given it back to a friend . Rochae was bailed without charge but must return to a police station next month. A police spokesman said inquiries were ongoing . 'If they thought they saw her with a gun on CCTV then why didn't they stop and search her there and then,' the 33-year-old said. She added police may have thought Rochae was a young boy because she had her hood up at the time. The six-inch afro comb, which has a black handle and metal prongs, belonged to the teenager's friend, she said. Police did not find it when searching the family's home on the night of her arrest with Rochae claiming she had already given it back to a friend. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'As officers were responding, police were contacted by the local authority CCTV control room, which was also monitoring the incident, with information that a female had been seen with what was believed to be a firearm in the area. 'Police arrived and a number of people were dispersed. A short while later, officers stopped a 15-year-old girl in Poplar Walk and she was subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm. 'No firearm has been recovered at this stage.

"There are fears inside Zimbabwe's that president Robert Mugabe wants to turn his dictatorial rule over the country into a monarchy - by getting his daughter to succeed him. He originally planned for his wife to assume the position of president after him but her worsening health has forced Mugabe to turn to his 24-year-old daughter Bona, according to the Times. She accompanied the 91-year-old dictator on a recent trip to Japan to meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - a move which drew widespread condemnation from parties within the country. Last year, Mugabe promoted his wife Grace to a senior position within his ruling ZANU-PF party where she led a vicious campaign to remove former vice-president Joice Mujuru from office. Scroll down for video . 'Dynasty': There are fears inside Zimbabwe that 91-year-old president Robert Mugabe (centre) wants his daughter Bona (left) to succeed him . But the 49-year-old has fallen severely ill in recent months and she has been taking regular trips to Singapore for medical treatment. In her absence, their daughter Bona has taken a more prominent role at the Zimbabwean president's side at official events and trips. Earlier this week, photographs emerged showing her with Mugabe - who is also in poor health - as part of a state delegation that held talks with Japan's prime minister. The move sparked furious criticism from opposition parties and political analysts but a ZANU-PF spokesman insisted the move was not politically motivated. In an interview with Nehanda Radio, Psychology Mazivisa said: 'Madam Bona Mugabe has not done anything nearly as much. 'We refuse to buy into the narrative that for as long as it's President Mugabe doing it, no matter how perfectly lawful it is, it's wrong... It's a barbaric way of doing politics.' But a spokesman for the opposition MDC party said it clearly showed 'that the state has been virtually privatised by the Mugabe dynasty'. Bona Mugabe-Chikore was born to Robert Mugabe's first wife Sally and attended the Dominican Convent School in Harare. Succession: Mugabe originally wanted his wife Grace (centre) to assume the position of president after him, but her worsening health has forced him to turn to his daughter Bona (right) An Irish nun who reportedly taught her there said: 'I never had a moment's trouble with the girl.' She enrolled at City University in Hong Kong under an alias and in 2011, she graduated with an honours degree in accountancy and administration. She gained a master's degree in banking and finance at the Management Development Institute in Zimbabwe two years later. And just last year, she married an Emirates airline pilot Simba Chikore in a luxurious wedding ceremony in Zimbabwe. Her inclusion in the diplomatic mission to Tokyo also sparked widespread condemnation because many civil servants in the country have worked for months without pay. Mugabe recently said he earned £8,000 a month compared to the average civil servant's salary of £200 but claimed: 'I am suffering just like you.'","24-year-old Bona Mugabe-Chikore was born to president's first wife Sally .

"Rare: Riad Al Qassas told customs the £2m statue from Libya was from Turkey and worth £100,000 . A judge took a day out of court yesterday to visit the British Museum. But it wasn’t for an Easter holiday jolly around the exhibits. It was to help him rule in the case of an ancient statue which is said to have be smuggled out of war-torn Libya. The trial centres on a businessman who claimed in paper work that the treasure was a statue for home decoration. Experts, however say the Greek marble figure – which is thought to depict Persephone, goddess of the underworld – was looted from a world heritage site. While the man who had it delivered to a warehouse in West London claimed it was about 100 years old and worth around £75,000, they say it is worth £2million and dates from the third to first centuries BC. They claim it was intended for the lucrative private market in classical antiquities. Yesterday District Judge John Zani – accompanied by a gaggle of barristers and solicitors – went to inspect the statue at the British Museum, where it is being safeguarded in a basement till the conclusion of the case. Although the press were barred from the viewing, a video of it was later played in court which showed the judge circling the statue as marks were pointed out to him. He was told stains and other evidence meant it was ‘definitely’ excavated illegally from the ancient Greek colony of Cyrene – once known as the Athens of Africa. It is said to have been smuggled out of Libya via Dubai in 2011 before being discovered by UK customs officials two years later. Libya has been plagued by looting and cultural vandalism since the fall of Colonel Gaddaffi in 2011, with the resulting power vacuum effectively ending the state-sponsored preservation of the country’s multiple Greek and Roman sites. The sculpture is said to have originally served as a grave marker and displays unusual iconography including snake-like bracelets and a doll-type figurine. Jordanian national Riad Al Qassas – who is not in court – is accused of falsifying paperwork after he told customs that the sculpture came from Turkey. Dr Peter Higgs, curator of Greek sculpture at the museum, told the judge the statue was in ‘the top ten’ of its class. Caught in a lie: Experts at the British Museum, pictured, say the statue is worth £2million and dates from the third to first centuries BC . He said: ‘I believe the statue was definitely made in Libya, in Cyrenaica’, adding it was extremely rare. He added that his valuation of £2million had been made on 2011 prices, but said there were no directly comparable examples from auction house records. Andrew Bird, for HMRC, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court that academics had decided ‘on the balance of probabilities, this statue had been unlawfully excavated from a UNESCO world heritage site’. He said documents suggested Al Qassas had only a marginal role in the export, placing the blame with Hassan Fazeli, a Dubai businessman who has claimed the sculpture has belonged to his family collection since 1977. Ben Watson, who represents Al Qassas, indicated his client would be happy to hand over the sculpture to Tripoli if it was shown to originate from there. Al Qassas denies knowingly or recklessly delivering a false document to HMRC. The case continues.

"The RAF has spent £37million on bombing raids in its mission to smash ISIS and bring Jihadi John's network to its knees. An investigation by MailOnline has unveiled the grand scale of the military effort against the terrorist group, including more than 100 airstrikes and 195 missiles fired. The bombings, carried out by Britain’s fleet of warplanes and unmanned drones, have targeted more than 180 ISIS positions and have killed dozens of Islamists so far in the six-month campaign. Scroll down for video . The bombings, carried out by Britain’s fleet of warplanes and unmanned drones, have targeted more than 180 ISIS positions (above), with some hit multiple times . The RAF has spent £37million on bombing raids in its mission to smash ISIS, fronted by Jihadi John (pictured), unveiled as Londoner Mohammed Emwazi . The raids, under the code name Operation Shader, have covered swathes of Iraq, with the RAF picking off terrorist targets deep inside ISIS territory. Britain has used Tornado GR4s at least 126 times in attacks on the militants, with each one flown from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus at an estimated cost of £35,000 an hour. With an average flight time of somewhere between four and eight hours - thanks to the help of Voyager air-to-air refuelling tankers accompanying them on each mission - the total cost quickly racks up to around £26.5million. Tornados are usually flown in pairs and are equipped with both Brimstone and Paveway IV missiles. Brimstones - ‘smart bombs’ which can pinpoint small targets in crowded areas - have been fired at least 54 times on trucks, buildings and groups of ISIS terrorists. The missiles cost £105,000 each and account for another £5.67million spent hunting down members of the barbaric group. Britain has used Tornado GR4s at least 126 times in attacks on the militants, with each raid flown from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in pairs (file picture) Weapons: At least 66 500lb Paveways have been dropped on ISIS in Iraq by the eight RAF Tornados in Iraq . Strike: The targeted bombings have killed dozens of Islamists so far in the six-month campaign . Meanwhile at least 66 500lb Paveways have been dropped on ISIS in Iraq by the eight Tornados the RAF has sent to the region. The heavier weapons are used on larger targets and cost £22,000 each. Because of the threat posed by Tornados to the Islamists, they have taken to travelling at night or in poor weather to avoid being seen. But this does not stop Britain’s fleet of 10 unmanned Reaper drones, which can locate and fire on small targets from as high as 45,000ft, from picking off ISIS convoys trying to take advantage of poor visibility. Reapers, which can fly for up to 30 hours before needing to refuel, have fired on the extremists 75 times during the RAF mission, which started in October last year. During 101 airstrikes on ISIS in Iraq, the RAF has fired: . 75 Hellfire missiles . 66 Paveway IV laser-guided bombs . 54 Brimstone missiles . The drones use aptly-named Hellfire missiles, which can incinerate targets in a burst of flames before they are even aware they are being fired upon and cost £46,000 a unit. The full £37million fight against ISIS does not include the costs of flying the drones, which are each worth around £8.5million, as their operation is shrouded in secrecy. The Ministry of Defence does not reveal where the drones take off and land, or even where they are ‘piloted’ from - however previous reports suggest they take off from Kuwait and are piloted remotely 4,600 miles away in Lincolnshire. In all, the 101 missions MailOnline are aware of have destroyed 186 ISIS targets, which includes command points, checkpoints and military convoys. According to a YouGov poll, more than 60 per cent of the British public approve of the bombings in Iraq. This is a 10 per cent rise from in September, showing the continued released of brutal snuff videos by the terrorists, such as the sickening beheadings by Jihadi John, unveiled last month as Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, have only caused the public to further back the UK mission. Critics have called for the RAF mission to be stepped up, despite David Cameron insisting that Britain’s role in Iraq is second only to that of the U.S.. Aerial attack: Reapers, which can fly for up to 30 hours before needing to refuel, have fired on the extremists 75 times during the RAF mission . The Commons Defence Committee said the RAF’s role in Iraq was ‘surprisingly modest’ and that the air force was only carrying out one strike a day. Dr Afzal Ashraf, from the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, said the RAF could only play a limited part in the fight against ISIS without the help of boots on the ground. He said: ‘The RAF plays has a small part of the total campaign against ISIS. 'They've done a good job but the problem with airpower is the target they face. Targets have to be fixed unless aircraft react fast to moving targets. This is particularly an issue with the predominant use of fast jets rather than close air support aircraft.’ ‘ISIS have learnt to adapt to the attacks. They very rarely move in broad daylight - they do so in bad weather and in small numbers. This makes it hard for the RAF to find valuable targets. 'The RAF has done as much as it can because of airpower's limited and perishable impact. Unless you have ground troops to exploit the impact airpower has, it can't be sustained.’ Britain has also provided 40 heavy machine guns to the Kurds, who are fighting against ISIS in Iraq, but this pales in significance when compared to Germany, which has sent more than 35,000 weapons to the fighters. UK forces have provided training to Peshmerga fighters, as well as sending around 400 support personnel to northern Iraq. While the MoD does not comment on ongoing operations, its latest update on the strikes on ISIS says: ‘Military support is just one part of the UK government’s contribution to the global coalition strategy to defeat ISIL – we are also taking action to counter the terrorist network’s finances, are restricting the flow of foreign fighters and have provided vital humanitarian relief to help those affected by ISIL’s brutality. ‘British military training teams continue to teach infantry and first aid skills to the Kurdish peshmerga, and liaison teams are embedded within Iraqi and coalition headquarters. ‘Having previously provided military equipment to the Iraqi forces, Britain plans to gift improvised explosive device (IED) detectors to help the Iraqi and Kurdish soldiers protect themselves against the numerous improvised explosive devices on which ISIL are increasingly relying as they are forced back by successful offensives. ‘In the Gulf, the Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyer HMS Dauntless is operating in direct support of the US Navy’s aircraft carrier, USS Carl Vinson, which provides a significant part of the coalition’s air effort.’","EXCLUSIVE: RAF has spent £37million on its bombing raids on ISIS in Iraq .

"They may look like any other children's toys - but this collection of model cars is expected to fetch a staggering £250,000 at auction next week. The rare set, which includes 2,000 Dinky toys as well as other classic car and train models, has been lovingly built up over 50 years. Retired car dealer Raymond Hainsworth, 78, and his wife Pat, started collecting when their twin sons Ian and David were babies so the pair would have a train set to play with on their first Christmas. Scroll down for video . Vast collection: Raymond Hainsworth has been building up his set of toy vehicles, which includes this Noddy car, for 50 years and the collection is expected to fetch a staggering £250,000 at auction. As their collection grew, Mr Hainsworth became dedicated to adding to it - and was still doing so two weeks before the auctioneers arrived to take it away. The toys have always been kept in their boxes and when Mr and Mrs Hainsworth became grandparents, the children were taught to look after the items after playing with them. The collection spread from Hornby, to English and French Dinky, Matchbox and Corgi, Triang Minic and Spot-On among other makes. It grew so big their home near Skipton, North Yorkshire, began to resemble a toy museum, Mrs Hainsworth said. Collected for fun: The retired car dealer insists he did not build up his vast set as an investment . Prized model: This Sweeteners Dinky truck is expected to sell for as much as  £5,600 at next month's auction . Among the pick of the collection are a black and white Dinky lorry in the Corn Products livery which was produced for the firm as a promotional item and was not on general sale. It could fetch over £5,000. Another rarity is a French Dinky Baroclem Citreon van, also never on general sale, which could make over £4,000. Mr Hainsworth decided to sell up as he wanted to put his entire collection in a single catalogue. He was at Vectis auction house at Thornaby, Teesside, to see it laid out ahead of a three day sale starting on March 17. Rare: This 1960s Thames Market Dinky truck has an estimated value of £3,200 . Carefully preserved: The family have kept all of the models with their boxes and Mr Hainsworth said his children and grandchildren were allowed to play with them as long as they were careful . Classic set: An auction house assistant holds a French Dinky Caravelle plane with an estimated value of £120 to be auctioned next week . He said: 'Part of me is sad of course, but we have had a lot of pleasure from it so I am not upset it is going.' The couple, who also have a daughter Melanie, have travelled thousands of miles across the country to build up their collection, visiting auctions and fairs. Just a fortnight before the auctioneers were coming to collect his toys, he was trying to add to it. Mr Hainsworth added: 'We wanted a certain Spot On tanker to go in the catalogue and we heard about one for sale in Grimsby. 'Unfortunately when we got there it was not up to our standards so we had to leave it after a 150-mile round trip.' Mr Hainsworth said that his set got so big that his house in North Yorkshire began to resemble a toy museum . The grandfather insists the collection was never intended as an investment but was built up for fun. And the children and grandchildren were allowed to play with them if they were careful. Mrs Hainsworth said many of the toys were kept in apple boxes and she was surprised to see how large the collection was. 'When I see them all laid out like this it is absolutely wonderful,' she said. Andrew Reed, Vectis auctioneer, said: 'It has been built up over the last 50 years and he has such passion for collecting the best of what he could find. 'It's so varied as well, from cars to trains to aeroplanes.' Hefty price tag: A 1950s Shackleton Dinky truck will be auctioned next week and has an estimated value of £1500 . Collector's items: Four different coloured Dinky breakdown trucks have each been priced at £100 .","Raymond Hainsworth, 78, and wife Pat, have collected models for 50 years .

"Scores of firefighters have been tackling a blaze following an explosion at a primary school in Weybridge today. Eight fire engines and more than 40 crew members are currently at the scene where flames and a huge plume of black smoke can be seen rising into the air. The explosion and resulting fire happened on the construction site of a new development at the £12,000-a-year St George's College Junior School, where children's ages range from 3 to 11. Fire alert: Clouds of black smoke billow from a construction site next to a school in Weybridge today following a suspected gas explosion . Plumes of smoke: Scores of firefighters have been tackling a fire in Weybridge following an explosion next to a primary school . Residents living nearby described hearing 'very nasty bangs' followed by a 'really nasty smell'. All of the school's pupils are accounted for, say police. The fire is believed to have broken out on the roof of an 'environmentally friendly' development in the school's grounds which is set to house new classrooms, an assembly hall and an IT suite. Speaking to The Surrey Comet, local Councillor Andrew Davis said: 'There is a plume of black smoke and the firefighters are dousing it now. The school has been evacuated. 'At this stage, there is a lot of smoke in the neighbourhood. I think the new building has a flat roof. The main thing is, I trust, none of the workers were put in danger. 'It is mayhem here – all the roads are blocked. The emergency tape is keeping people quite a long way back.' Dozens of people in the surrounding area watched and took pictures as emergency services arrived to tackle the blaze. Huge clouds of smoke can be seen rising from a building close to a primary school in Weybridge . Emergency respopnse: Eight fire engines and more than 40 crew members are currently at the scene and a plume of black smoke can be seen rising into the air .

Panic: St George's College Junior School, where children age 3 to 11, was evacuated after the explosion . A spokesman for Surrey Police said: 'Surrey Police was called to St George's Primary School in Thames Street, Weybridge at around 12.40pm today following reports of a fire. 'The emergency services quickly attended the scene but there are no reports of any injuries. 'Officers are providing assistance to Surrey Fire and Rescue Service while the fire is tackled. A cordon is in place and several local roads have been closed. 'Motorists are being advised to avoid the area if possible. All pupils have been accounted for and are being looked after by school staff. 'Due to traffic congestion and road closures parents of pupils at the school are being advised not to attend the location but await further updates.Further updates will follow in due course.' Tamsin Blakeney, who runs Piglets Play Centre in Hersham which is used by a number of St George's Junior School children, was driving her daughter to Weybridge Hospital when she witnessed the beginning of the fire. She told Get Surrey: 'I saw huge plumes of smoke, I have never seen anything like it. Surrey Police are asking drivers to avoid the area while firefighters attempt to put out the blaze . Reaction: A number of people on Twitter have said that the fire was caused by an exploding gas cylinder . 'I didn't see any emergency services at that point but did see children being evacuated and holding hands with adults who looked calm, but there were a few people panicking - it was awful, terrifying. 'The whole area is just covered with a smog. It smells like some kind of cable fire, not a bonfire, but like chemicals - it is just horrible.' A number of other witnesses took to Twitter to describe the dramatic scenes in Surrey today with many expressing concern over the safety of the local school's children. One Twitter user suggested there had been a gas explosion. Miranda Schunke, wrote: 'Weybridge school explosion - gas cylinder exploded after insulation caught fire - unconfirmed.' Work began on the new development, believed to be the building on fire, in July 2014. On the St George's Junior School website it states: 'The new facility has been designed to be very environmentally friendly with energy efficiency and sustainability in mind and will include low energy lighting, extra insulation and materials sourced from sustainable forests'. A statement released by the school today read: 'St George's Weybridge can confirm that a fire took place on the roof of a building under construction at St George's Junior School in Weybridge late this morning (Friday 13 March 2015). A number of witnesses took to Twitter to describe the dramatic scenes in Surrey today with many expressing concern over the safety of the local school's children . Headmaster Anthony Hudson said: 'While this has come as a great shock, I am very relieved that not a single person was hurt' 'The building is in a separate compound under the control of our building contractor and no school personnel or children were in the vicinity. 'Everyone within the School was evacuated quickly, the emergency services are attending and it can be confirmed that there are no injuries to pupils, staff, visitors or building workers. 'The emergency services and School have allowed children back into class this afternoon and school is continuing normally, whilst allowing parents to collect their children early should they so wish. 'The Headmaster, Mr Antony Hudson, took the normal Friday assembly soon afterwards for all the older children. The Chief Fire Officer was able to explain to them that fires like this are extremely rare and that he was very impressed by the manner in which they conducted themselves very safely.'","Reports of explosion followed by plumes of smoke in Weybridge, Surrey .

"An Idaho woman who is suspected of beating a hunter's falcon to death with a beaded scarf after she saw it take down a duck is facing a misdemeanor charge that the pet's owner thinks is too lenient. Patti MacDonald, 60, of Hauser, was charged with beating or harassing an animal after authorities say she fractured the skull of an eight-year-old falcon named Hornet on January 7. Hornet's owner, Scott Dinger, said MacDonald should be charged with killing a protected species. Patti MacDonald of Hauser, Idaho, was charged with beating or harassing an animal after she allegedly beat a hunter's pet falcon (example pictured) to death with a beaded scarf in an effort to save a duck . Scott Dinger (seen with other falcon) thinks MacDonald's misdemeanor charge was not harsh enough . Dinger, who was hunting with Hornet at the time, was about 500 yards away when the bird of prey made a successful attack and landed with the duck. He said he was approaching the spot when he saw MacDonald's red Jeep Wrangler pull up. Hornet flew away but appeared injured and Dinger found him dead about an hour later, the Coeur d'Alene Press reported. The duck also died. According to Dinger, Hornet had been with humans since the day he was hatched. He said: 'They don't really know they are falcons. 'That was probably a part of his undoing because you could walk up to him and he wouldn't fly or try to get away.' The duck (example pictured) also died. MacDonald is facing up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine . Dinger said it was tough to accept what happened because his bird was so young and falcons can live for about 30 years when they're with humans. He said: 'I had planned for Hornet to live longer than me.' Craig Walker, a regional conservation officer for the Idaho Fish and Game Department, said he received an anonymous call from a woman saying she tried to save a duck from a falcon. The phone system identified the caller as MacDonald. Walker wrote in a report: 'The woman later stated that she had been very upset about the duck being injured, but felt bad about injuring someone's pet, because she 'beat the crap out of it really hard.'"" Kootenai County Prosecutor Barry McHugh said he reviewed Walker's report and determined the misdemeanor charge was appropriate. Beating or harassing an animal is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $5,000 for a first-time offender. Peregrine falcons were on the threatened and endangered species list, but they were removed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1999. 'There are between 2,000 and 3,000 breeding pairs of American peregrine falcons in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.' according to the FWS. It's unclear if Hornet was a peregrine.","Authorities say Patti MacDonald fractured skull of a falcon named Hornet .

"Have you ever read through a particularly expletive-laden passage in a book and felt the language was a bit too rich for your tastes? If so, you might be interested in Clean Reader which censors swear words from ebooks - and allows children to enjoy works of literature that contain profanity. The app replaces certain words that might be deemed R-rated with more friendly alternatives, but one author has derided it as encouraging 'suppression'. An Idaho-based couple has released a censoring app for iOS and Android. Called Clean Reader it deletes certain swear words from books. Alternatives are then suggested when the user taps on the deleted word. Shown is an excerpt from Gone Girl, where 'sh****' becomes 'crappy' The app is available now for free on both iOS and Android devices and was developed by couple Jared and Kirsten Maughan from Twin Falls in Idaho. Lady Chatterley’s Lover by D. H. Lawrence . Before: ‘I don’t want to f*** you at all. My heart’s as cold as cold potatoes just now.’ After: ‘I don’t want to [freak] you at all.

When a book is opened, readers can switch between ‘clean’, ‘cleaner’ or ‘squeaky clean’ settings. The lowest setting only blocks ‘major swear words,’ according to Clean Reader, which includes ‘the F-word’. The ‘cleaner’ setting blocks slightly more words, while the highest setting ‘is the most restrictive setting and will block the most profanity from a book including some hurtful racial terms.’ In the books, deleted words are covered up with a grey box, removing them from view. If users click a green dot in the middle of the box, the app will suggest alternative words that the can be used instead. For example, in an excerpt from best-selling novel Gone Girl, a censored sentence reads: ‘The girl is one step ahead of me in everything, even [crappy] luck.’ In another example, a segment of D. H. Lawrence’s 1928 novel Lady Chatterley’s Lover reads, in ‘squeaky clean’ mode: ‘I don’t want to [freak] you at all. My heart’s as cold as cold potatoes just now.' The famous intro to Irvine Welsh’s 1993 novel Trainspotting, meanwhile, reads: ‘Choose sitting oan a couch watching mind-numing and spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing [freaking] junk food intae yir mooth.’ The app works by scanning through a book and blocking out offensive words, letting readers of all ages enjoy books that might otherwise be deemed not suitable for them. Users can pick between 'clean', 'cleaner' and 'squeaky clean'. The lowest setting blocks 'major' swear words, and the highest blocks all profanity.

Shown left is an excerpt from Lady Chatterley's Lover, where the word 'sex' has been replaced by love. On the right is an excerpt from the same book, with this time 'penis' replaced by 'groin' In the section shown left of Irvine Welsh's profranity-ridden Trainspotting (cover image of the book shown on the right), 'sh**' is changed to crap, while many other words on the page have been changed - which tends to be a common theme for the book . After downloading the app, users are able to browse a variety of books in the app’s store which have been scanned to replace or remove profanity with other words . Condemning the app on her blog, in a post titled ‘why I’m saying “f*** you” to Clean Reader’, author of Chocolat, Joanne Harris, likened it to examples of suppression from history. She said: 'Anyone who works with words understands their power. Words, if used correctly, can achieve almost anything. 'To tamper with what is written - however much we may dislike certain words and phrases - is to embrace censorship. ‘We’ve been down this road before. We should know where it leads by now. It starts with blanking out a few words. It goes on to drape table legs and stick fig leaves onto statues. 'It progresses to denouncing gay or Jewish artists as “degenerate”. It ends with burning libraries and erasing whole civilizations from history.’ ‘One day our oldest child came home from school and she was a little sad,’ explained the creators of the app. ‘We asked her what was wrong and she said she had been reading a book during library time and it had a few swear words in it. ‘Eventually we decided we would do all we could to bring Clean Reader to the world.’ The creators note that the app doesn’t violate copyright law as it doesn’t make actual changes to the book. ‘All Clean Reader does is change the way the content is displayed on the screen,’ they note. The app has come under criticism, though, for censoring works by authors - and changing the meaning of the book as originally intended. 'To tamper with what is written - however much we may dislike certain words and phrases - is to embrace censorship,' said author of Chocolat Joanne Harris in her blog. ‘We’ve been down this road before.

"Bamber Gascoigne, pictured with his wife Christina, has ‘accidentally’ inherited an historic stately home – and it could be worth up to £10million . Bamber Gascoigne has ‘accidentally’ inherited one of Britain’s most historic stately homes – and it could be worth up to £10million. The former University Challenge host has been left West Horsley Place near Leatherhead in Surrey by his aunt and godmother, the Duchess of Roxburghe, who was one of the train-bearers for Queen Elizabeth at the 1937 Coronation of King George VI. The 50-room house, which has its roots in the 11th Century, has been visited by Royalty and was once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh’s son. It is rumoured to have once housed Sir Walter’s head after his beheading for treason in 1618. But despite its illustrious history, West Horsley Place has been at risk of falling into ruin. Gascoigne, 80, who discovered he has been left the property only when he was contacted by his solicitor, has embarked on a mission to save the crumbling estate. He and his wife Christina are sacrificing some of the extraordinary treasures they found inside to finance the expensive repairs. They plan to sell an estimated £2.2million of jewels, paintings, furniture and artefacts through Sotheby’s auction house. Among them is the gown worn by the Duchess at George VI’s Coronation. Gascoigne said he is committed to ensuring the house ‘continues to stand as a monument of its remarkable past’, and hopes to eventually open it to the curious public. ‘It was completely unexpected by me that I would be heir to her estate,’ he said of the Duchess. ‘She had expressed that, given the work required to restore the house, she expected I would sell it. Home: The former University Challenge host has inherited West Horsley Place near Leatherhead in Surrey . The 50-room house was left to Gascoigne by his aunt and godmother, the Duchess of Roxburghe (pictured), who was one of the train-bearers for Queen Elizabeth at the 1937 Coronation of King George VI . ‘But it’s such an incredible place and we knew it well, so the idea of immediately selling it off seemed not only amazingly foolish but also missing the fun that was involved. ‘Having spent many memorable times with my godmother here, and knowing how special the house was to her and her family, together with my wife I decided to take up the challenge of carrying out the essential work to the house to ensure that it can withstand what may lie ahead over the course of its future.’ Christina said that once it was restored to its full glory it could be worth up to £10million. The house itself was once visited by King Henry VIII for a 35-course banquet. The Duchess, who was born Mary Evelyn Hungerford Crewe-Milnes in 1915, was one of the great beauties of her age and a goddaughter of George V.

"A farmer who left dozens of pigs drowning in a mud pit that was so disgusting seven of the animals had to be put down has been fined more than £37,000. Jonathan Forbes-Brown, 54, allowed the 64 animals to live in squalid conditions and failed to provide food and water at his farm in Braintree, Essex. Seven of the animals had suffered so much that they had to be put down after getting stuck in mud to such an extent that slurry covered more than half of their body. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Jonathan Forbes-Brown, 54, allowed  64 pigs to live in squalid conditions and failed to provide food and water at his farm in Braintree, Essex. Dozens of the pigs were found drowning in mud and covered in slurry (above) Forbes-Brown allowed the animals to live in the thick slurry and failed to help them when they became stuck in the mud. RSPCA officers spent hours rescuing the animals from the 'worst conditions they had ever seen' Seven of the pigs had to be put down after being rescued from the mud pit, while another was found to be suffering from a bad leg injury having been hit by a car but never taken to the vets by Forbes-Brown . Another pig was found to be suffering from a bad leg injury after being hit by a car and never being taken to the vet. Forbes-Brown denied seven animal cruelty charges for failing to provide a suitable environment, food, fresh water or appropriate veterinary care at Colchester Magistrates' Court. However, he was found guilty by magistrates and fined more than £37,000. Samantha Garvey, an RSPCA Inspector, said rescuers spent hours trying to free the pigs from the mud after receiving reports they were living in squalor. She said: 'These were the worst conditions I have ever had to work in - the pigs had just been left to literally drown in the mud. 'The slurry was halfway up their bodies in some cases, and took several of us most of the day to try and heave them out to safety.

'A lot of the pigs were in a very weak condition and they could not have escaped, or survived, had they been left.' Ms Garvey said that heavy rain had turned the pigs' pen into a deep slurry pit that had sucked them into the mud, with Forbes-Brown not having the experience to resolve the issue. She said: 'This was a case of someone keeping pigs as a hobby, without realising how hard pigs are to look after. 'He just did not have the experience or expertise to care for them. They did not have water or food, and no vet had ever attended to make sure they were cared for. 'This lack of knowledge, along with the bad weather, led to a near tragedy.'

"A pair of mysterious bright spots on the asteroid Ceres could be towering 'water volcanoes', scientists claim. Recent images from the Dawn spacecraft reveal the spots, dubbed 'feature number 5', at various angles as the asteroid rotates. The glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of Ceres, suggesting that they must be high above the surface rather than at the bottom of an impact crater, as previously believed. Scroll down for video . Ceres rotates in this sped-up movie comprised of images taken by NASA's Dawn mission during its approach to the dwarf planet. The glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of Ceres, suggesting that are on a high elevation in relation to the rest of the surface . 'What is amazing is that you can see the feature while the rim is still in the line of sight,' said Andreas Nathues, a planetary scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany. He noted that at dawn on Ceres, the spots shine brightly, but fade as dusk draws in. According to Nature, this could mean sunlight plays an important role in the formation of the features by, for instance, heating up ice just beneath the surface and causing it blast of in a plume. Scientists have speculated that the interior of Ceres is rocky with a layer of water and ice. The leading theory now for the alien spots is that the ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that at times forms into huge 'cryovolcanoes' due to internal pressure in the asteroid. Ceres continues to baffle astronomers as Dawn orbits the dwarf planet. This image was taken by the Dawn spacecraft of dwarf planet Ceres on February 19 from a distance of nearly 29,000 miles (46,000 km). It shows that the brightest spot on Ceres has a dimmer companion, which apparently lies in the same basin . Dawn observed Ceres completing one full rotation, which lasted about nine hours. The images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at Ceres' surface: from shallow, flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers . Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. The Dawn spacecraft pulled into orbit earlier this month around the Ceres in the asteroid belt. The probe is currently on the dark side of Ceres and won't emerge until April. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice, water, and minerals. While Nasa has not provided an explanation, scientists previously said these spots may be frozen pools of ice at the bottom of a crater that reflect light. The Dawn  spacecraft pulled into orbit earlier this month around the Ceres in the asteroid belt. The probe is currently on the dark side of Ceres and won't emerge until April. For now, the team say they need higher resolution images of the 'alien' spots to reveal its true nature. 'It could be quite interesting,' Dawn lead scientist Christopher Russell, with the University of California, Los Angeles told Discovery News. 'I believe we'll show Ceres is every bit a planet as its terrestrial neighbors Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury,' Russell said. As scientists receive better views of the dwarf planet over the next few months, they hope to gain a deeper understanding of its origin and evolution by studying its surface. The intriguing bright spots and other interesting features of this captivating world will come into sharper focus. 'The brightest spot continues to be too small to resolve with our camera, but despite its size it is brighter than anything else on Ceres,' said Andreas Nathues, lead investigator for the framing camera team at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Gottingen, Germany. Dawn has been steadily returning stunning animations of Ceres. 'We know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet Ceres. 'Now, Dawn is ready to change that,' said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director, based at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. The 'alien' mark can be clearly seen in images the icy world as the Dawn probe hurtled its way towards a rendezvous on March 6 . Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset image at lower left . Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. 'Now, finally, we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious, alien world,' Dawn mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said. 'Soon it will reveal myriad secrets Ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system.' Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter. One scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early Earth and Moon - delivering organic molecules and water to Earth. Ceres is twice the size of Saturn's geyser-spouting moon Enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Since launching in 2007, Dawn has already visited Vesta, a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles (168 million km) away from Ceres. The distance between Vesta and Ceres is greater than the distance between the Earth and the sun. During its 14 months in orbit around Vesta, the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights, including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface .","Images from Dawn reveal the spots, dubbed 'feature number 5', at various angles as the asteroid rotates .

But Nick Clegg's children also have to suffer the humiliation of seeing him dad-dancing in the kitchen  of their £1.5million townhouse to Meghan Trainor's hit 'All About That Bass'. Becoming the latest political leader to lift the lid on his family life, Mr Clegg spoke about the 'very strong' bond with his wife Miriam and their three sons, and baulked at the idea of betting his family home on his re-election in May. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg revealed how he enjoys dancing in his kitchen, and admitted some of his collapse in support could have been avoided . David Cameron posed in his kitchen chopping tomatoes and carrots, Nicola Sturgeon showed off her top-of-the-range coffee machine. But Mr Clegg suggested he uses his kitchen for dancing rather than cooking. Speaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain, the Lib Dem leader said: 'We are very lucky to have a very strong [family]. 'We both come from very strong, warm families and both of our families are large, boisterous, loud, warm families. 'We do sort of dance together a bit, we were all dancing in the kitchen to All About the Bass the other day and I don't think my kids were very impressed by my dancing but I enjoyed it.' He also revealed how his eldest son, Antonio, is almost too old for a fatherly kiss when he does the school run twice a week. 'He's 13… I still just get a little kiss in if I can,' Mr Clegg said. Mr  Clegg revealed how his children have to suffer the humiliation of seeing him dad-dancing with wife Miriam in the kitchen of their £1.5million townhouse to Meghan Trainor's hit 'All About That Bass' Polls suggest the Lib Dems are heading for an electoral bloodbath on May 7, with Mr Clegg facing a battle to hang on to his seat in Sheffield Hallam. He has repeatedly insisted the party will defy the 'cottage industry' of pessimism, but stopped short of betting the family home on his survival. He told ITV's Kate Garraway: 'I'd put a very healthy bet on it. Would I bet my house? That's slightly unfair on Miriam and the boys if it goes pear shaped… . 'Do I think it is essential to have Liberal Democrats around the cabinet table? Unsurprisingly I really, really do. 'Politics is not for the faint hearted and what goes up, goes down, what goes down, goes up. You can't just give up.' Megaon Trainor's hit song reached number one in the UK and was one of the best selling singles of last year . He admitted he has faced a 'topsy turvy' time in government, and some of his collapse in support could have been avoided. He said: 'I think some of it, I'm sure not all of it, but I think some of it is probably inevitable. If you, as the traditional third party in Government, go into coalition with one of the two bigger ones, it's just a highly controversial thing to do.' Asked if he likes David Cameron, Mr Clegg replied: 'Um, it's not like or dislike really. We've worked out how to work together I suppose, it's quite a business-like partnership.'","Lib Dem leader reveals how he likes to unwind at home by dancing .

"Between commuting time and work hours, New York City residents have the longest work weeks among the country's 30 biggest cities, city Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a report released Tuesday. The report said a typical week for a full-time New York worker adds up to more than 49 hours, including an average of more than six hours of commuting time. That was more than four hours longer than in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the average work week was about 44 1/2 hours. Commuting time made up just under 3 1/2 hours of that. The report was based on data from the U.S. Census from 1990 and 2000 and the 2013 American Community Survey. Busy schedules: The report said a typical week for a full-time New York worker adds up to more than 49 hours, including an average of more than six hours of commuting time. Commuters are seen in New York in 2014 . Research: New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer released the findings in a report on Tuesday. Stringer is seen here in this March 5, 2015 file photo . Stringer said commuting times were longer for lower-wage workers, who were more likely than higher-wage workers to live in parts of the city that aren't as well-served by public transportation. Security guards, for example, on average spent more than eight hours a week commuting. 'Nursing and home health aides and maids and housekeepers also report long commutes, while chief executives, taxi drivers and physicians and surgeons report the shortest commutes,' the report said. In a statement, Stringer said 'New York is America’s hardest working city, but it’s a one-two punch for lower wage workers, who get paid less and travel longer to get to work. 'This means employees in the Big Apple get paid less than it appears on an hourly basis, because their commutes are significantly greater than anyone else in the country.' The report found that 'In New York City, workers in the finance sector, on average, work the longest workweeks. With usual work schedules topping 47 hours, New York City financial workers spend, on average, almost four hours more per week working than do their counterparts in other large cities.' It also said that workers in advertising, media, computer, legal services, arts and entertainment, food service, and retail trade have longer hours compared to people with jobs in those industries in other major US cities. 'But longer workweeks are not characteristic of all New York City industries,' the report said. City workers in manufacturing, real estate, and health care, for example, work fewer hours in a typical week than do workers in those industries in other large cities.' Stringer said the report showed a need for the city to expand its transit networks, as well as promote flexible work arrangements along with predictable scheduling. 'If New York City is going to symbolize the American Dream, we can’t be a nightmare when it comes to long work hours and commuting,' Stringer said in the statement. 'Our residents deserve better.'

"Mocked: Texas senator Ted Cruz, 44, has been mocked online by the prank . Presidential candidate Ted Cruz is being mocked online by internet pranksters who turned a site bearing his name into an ad for President Obama and his immigration reforms. While the 44-year-old senator (R-Texas) was busy launching his campaign in Virginia and touring TV studios, anybody logging onto TedCruz.com this week will have got a surprise. For, rather than being festooned with smiling pictures of the tea party darling and talking up his hopes of 'reigniting the promise of America', the page ribs him about two of his bugbears.

The presidential hopeful, who constantly castigates Obama and speaks out on border control, is using TedCruz.org for his campaign instead. It is hardly the only such jibe internet users have made at Cruz's expense. TedCruzForAmerica.com has been programmed to redirect users straight to healthcare.gov - the medical insurance exchange established by the President's Obamacare laws. The site seems especially apt given that Cruz today admitted that he himself is signing up for Obamacare, as he will no longer be covered by his wife's plan. A third snub comes in the form of TedCruz.ca, a site dedicated to reminding voters that Cruz, son to a Cuban father and American mother, was in fact born in Canada. His place of birth is not widely thought to rule him out as a presidential contender, but will still function as a stick for critics to beat him with.

"Notorious London gangster Eddie Richardson, 68, has been nominated for an award for his charity work, it has been reported . Notorious South London gangster Eddie Richardson, who terrorised the capital in the Sixties and Seventies with his brother Charlie, is in line for a top charity award, it has been reported. The 68-year-old, who dabbled in drugs, racketeering and employed torturer 'Mad' Frankie Fraser as his enforcer, is now being backed for the Freedom of the Borough of Southwark. The nod comes after he helped to raise funds to fight Motor Neurone Disease, supported the Multiple Sclerosis Society and helped disadvantaged children. According to The Sun, a nomination from the Mayor's office for the award fails to mention his decades of criminal activities, and refers to his 2002 release from prison as 'retirement'. The application says: 'Eddie can always find time to help those around him. Nothing is too much trouble.' The Richardson Gang operated in South London during its most troubled years in the Sixties and Seventies, and became so notorious it rivalled the Kray Twins' reign of terror. Brothers Eddie and Charlie used a scrap metal business and fruit machine company as fronts for a criminal empire involving drug dealing, protection and extortion rackets. The gang were most feared for their enforcer, 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, who tortured anyone who crossed them following trial by kangaroo court run by the brothers. His favoured methods of torture were rumoured to be pulling teeth out with pliers, nailing people to the floor using six inch spikes, and electrocuting others using a crank-handled telephone. Eddie, along with his brother Charlie, terrorised south London in the Sixties and Seventies, indulging in drug dealing, extortion and protection rackets (pictured, Eddie with his Rolls Royce) But it is claimed that Eddie (pictured sitting third left, with brother Charlie standing second left) has now been nominated for the Freedom of the Borough of Southwark after raising money for charitable causes . It has also been claimed Fraser also used electric fires, knives and axes in his 'torture chamber'. Being taken to Fraser's chamber was allegedly known as 'getting a shirt from Frankie' after his method of giving victims clean shirts to wear home after their ordeals. Eddie was described by two separate Home Secretaries as ‘one of the most dangerous men in Britain’ and has served a total of 46 years in jail. His career-ending arrest came in 1990, when he was busted following a £70 million drugs deal that earned him a 35-year prison sentence, eventually commuted to 13 years. Aside from the Krays and Fraser, his associates include the Great Train Robbers, the prison reformer Lord Longford, and Brian Keenan, then head of the armed council of the IRA. The Richardson Gang, as they were known, were most feared for their enforcer 'Mad' Frankie Fraser (pictured) who ran a 'torture chamber' punishing those who crossed the gang by pulling out teeth with pliers . Richardson was described by two successive home secretaries as 'one of the most dangerous men in Britain', and ran an empire to rival the Kray twins (pictured left to right, Reggie, Charlie and Ronnie Kray) Today the former gangster lives in a £2.5million house in Beckenham, Kent, holidays in Marbella, organises charity golf competitions and paints portraits of friends. When asked about Richardson's charity nominations, Labour councillors Ian Wingfield and Dora Dixon, who supported the application, refused to answer. The decision of whether to award Richardson the freedom of Southwark will be made shortly.","Eddie Richardson ran drugs and protection rackets with brother Charlie .

"Fast food giant Domino’s is selling ‘Frankenfood’ pizzas to customers while claiming to be ‘GM-free’ on its website. It has emerged that their ‘thin and crispy’ pizza bases have been made using genetically modified soya bean oil and maize flour since February. Waitrose has also been selling imported American confectionery which contains GM sugar beet and a soya derivative and Marks & Spencer has been stocking American sauces and cookies containing GM soya and corn – even though the firm has previously boasted about not using GM ingredients. Fast food giant Domino’s is selling ‘Frankenfood’ pizzas to customers while claiming to be ‘GM-free’ on its website . The double-dealing has been identified by GM Freeze, which is campaigning to raise awareness about how GM foods are creeping into the national diet without the knowledge and approval of consumers. The group’s director, Liz O’Neill, is now demanding an investigation to see if Domino’s has broken labelling laws – as firms using GM ingredients are required to label their use. She said: ‘Domino’s website currently contradicts itself. If they have introduced GM ingredients to their pizza crusts then customers should be told much more clearly. ‘People in the UK have demonstrated time and again that they don’t want to eat GM food and the FSA’s public attitudes survey recently showed concern about GM at an all-time high. ‘Whether people are motivated by concern for declining wildlife and flourishing superweeds, for the wider ethical issues around GM farming or just their own personal choice, we all have the right to know what we are buying before we get to the till.’ Waitrose has also been selling imported American confectionery which contains GM sugar beet and a soya derivative . Domino’s has confirmed that it has been using thin and crispy pizza bases with GM ingredients since the beginning of February after its usual supplier in Ireland had a factory fire which stopped production. The firm apologised for not updating its website, and confirmed that it hopes to return to using non-GM bases in September. M&S said its decision to stock GM products ‘in no way affects our commitment to only using non-GM ingredients in M&S food’. And a Waitrose spokesman insisted that any GM ingredients in American chocolate stocked by the store were ‘clearly labelled’. GM crops like sugar beet, corn or maize and soya have been at the centre of concerns that the associated industrial farming practices have caused serious harm to the environment. Marks & Spencer has been stocking American sauces and cookies containing GM soya and corn – even though the firm has previously boasted about not using GM ingredients . The plants have been altered through the insertion of foreign genes that create toxins to kill insects or give them immunity to spraying with powerful chemical weed killers. There is evidence from the USA that certain weeds have developed immunity to the same weed killers with the result that they are taking over many fields. At the same time, the use of sprays alongside the GM crops is thought to have caused a collapse in the population of the Monarch butterfly, which is now under threat. Critics of the technology are also concerned about the lack of independent research to show the resulting food is safe to eat. A recent Food Standards Agency (FSA) study found a rise in concerns about GM food. Some 24per cent listed GM as a concern, which was higher than food hygiene in the home.","'Thin and crispy' pizza bases made using GM soya bean oil and maize flour since February .

"They were supposed to be presenting a united front before tomorrow's Budget marks the unofficial end of the coalition. But David Cameron and Nick Clegg looked more like the cast of Armageddon as they marched through a dark tunnel in bright orange overalls. Both men rushed to claim credit for a sharp rise in the minimum wage, but behind the smiles there are deep divisions over which tax cuts will be announced by George Osborne tomorrow. Scroll down for video . Armageddon? Nick Clegg (second left) and David Cameron (right) swapped Downing Street for a tunnel deep underground for a joint visit before the Budget . Wearing bright orange overalls on a visit to Crossrail, the party leaders looked like they were in the cast of the 1998 film starring Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck . In the depths of the eurozone crisis in 2011, Vince Cable warned of an 'Armageddon scenario' if the single currency collapsed. But the government hopes to set out a more upbeat picture this week, claiming to have brought the British economy back from the brink. Tomorrow's Budget is expected to include a promise of tax cuts for low and middle earners, extra money for mental health and freedom for pensioners to turn their retirement into a cash lump sum. Today Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg made a joint announcement on rises in the minimum wage. Wearing bright orange overalls on a visit to Crossrail, they looked like they were in the cast of the 1998 film starring Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck. Mr Cameron hopes to use the Budget to catapult the Tories into a poll lead ahead of the election on May 7 . The rate for apprentices will rise sharply by 57p from £2.73 per hour to £3.30 - 50p more than had been recommended by the independent Low Pay Commission. Ministers said the proposed small hike in the rate for apprentices failed to reflect efforts to boost the status of vocational alternatives as a way into well-paid jobs - and went beyond the recommendation for the second time in three years. Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg met apprentices working on a major transport project to promote the change - in one of their last joint appearances as coalition partners before May's general election. 'No-one should earn less than £3 an hour,' Mr Cameron said after touring work beneath London on a station for the capital's new Crossrail link. 'It is a good deal, it is right for our country and we can only do it because we have got a strong economy. 'I have been talking to apprentices here who after two or three years as an apprentice could be earning £25-£26,000 a year. That's right. That's what I want for our country - a country where if you work hard and do the right thing you get rewarded.' Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg both defended a sharp rise in the minimum wage for apprentices to over £3 an hour . Mr Clegg said the 'vast majority' of employers already paid apprentices at least that sum but that it was right to significantly increase the minimum. 'Generally governments do what the Low Pay Commission says,' he said. 'But on this occasion we felt that ... £2.80 - that is still pretty low, even for apprentices to get by on.' Even though it was right that they earned less than full-time workers 'they do nonetheless need to be paid in a way that allows them to earn and learn, get their qualifications and then move on to full-time employment'. With just two weeks until the start of the election campaign, both men will hope to avoid heading to the exit door . CBI director-general John Cridland said the overruling on the apprentice rate was 'disappointing'. 'The national minimum wage has been one of the most successful policies of recent years, thanks to the independence of the commission - its politicisation is worrying,' he said. Concerns were also raised by Federation of Small Businesses chairman John Allan who said the large rise came on top of other increased apprenticeship costs and would have to be 'monitored closely', and by British Retail Consortium director general Helen Dickinson who warned that any significant departure 'risks upsetting the fine balance struck by the LPC and potentially negatively impacting workers, the economy or both'. But Sharon Spice, director of student recruitment at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), said the rise would 'help remove some of the stigma around apprenticeships being a second rate career option, making them more attractive to young people' though more funding was needed to support small businesses in offering them. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said there should have been a 'much bolder increase' in the main rate. 'With one in five workers getting less than a living wage, this is nowhere near enough to end in-work poverty. Britain's minimum-wage workers should be very fearful of the billions of pounds of cuts to government help for the low-paid that the Chancellor is planning if re-elected,' she said.","Prime Minister and his deputy don orange overalls for visit to Crossrail .

"A father accidentally knocked down and killed his toddler daughter outside their home after being distracted by the family dog, an inquest has heard. Sixteen-month-old Angel Pitts tragically died when she wandered in front of the family car outside her home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, last June. An inquest into her death heard how father, Scott Pitts, 36, was calling his partner to fetch the family's Jack Russell from the road when the accident happened. Angel Pitts was tragically knocked down and killed when her father accidentally drove into her last summer . The little girl - who had only just learned to walk - was found underneath the family's Toyota Avensis by her devastated father. He initially thought he had hit one of children's garden toys left on the drive, the hearing was told. Sergeant Carl Quinn, from West Yorkshire Police's Collision Investigation Unit, told the coroner: 'Scott got into his vehicle to go and collect a DVD for the family to watch later that evening. 'Angel was in the house watching TV. He went forward when the dog followed him out of the gate. He called to Megin to fetch it inside. Angel had apparently left the house unseen by anyone. 'She walked into the road to the near side of the vehicle within the path of the turning car - she was struck by the near side front wheel resulting in a knock to the ground and injuries to her head. 'Scott realised he had impacted with something which he thought was one of the children's toys. As he looked he found Angel underneath the car by the front wheels.' Mr Pitts' partner Megin Darch told police in interview: 'Scott shouted at me to pick up the dog as he didn't want to run it over so I went out to pick it up. It always runs in the road. 'Shortly after I heard a scream. He was screaming 'help me, help me'.' Mr Pitts thought his daughter was inside the family home in Leeds, West Yorkshire at the time of the accident . Mourners at Angel's funeral wore animal onesies and pink clothes in memory of the 16-month-old . Neighbour Craig Holmes said he heard a man screaming for help from across the road and looked out to see Scott carrying the little girl as his partner Megin Darch rushed out and wailed. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Assistant Coroner Jonathan Leach said he was satisfied Scott Pitts had not been able to see the youngster in front of the car. In a statement read to the Leeds court, Ms Darch said: 'Angel was tragically killed in a terrible accident. She was very happy at home, she would bounce up and down on her trampoline. 'Angel was very clingy with me. She was a very good girl, good-natured and ate well. She was no trouble at all and got on well with all the family and her brother. 'Scott has been very affected - he says he is okay but I don't think that he is. I've told him it's not his fault it was an accident. He thinks I hate him but I don't. 'I'm devastated about what happened but I carry on for my son's sake. 'I cannot really describe how I have felt since the accident. We miss Angel so much and we will never forget her.' The family paid tribute to the infant by dressing in onesies at a Disney-themed funeral, which was attended by crowds of mourners from the shocked community. Angel's mother said the death has had a huge impact on the family, saying: 'We will never forget her'","Little girl had just learned to walk before the accident in Leeds last June .

"A probe into how police handled child sexual exploitation in Rotherham is looking into allegations against 42 officers after complaints were sent to the force watchdog. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was already examining allegations against ten officers involved in the investigation into one of the country's most prolific child abuse rings. But today the commission said it had received 30 new complaints containing 100 allegations about 42 officers involved in the Rotherham investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is examining 100 allegations made against 42 officers from South Yorkshire Police who investigated child sex abuse in Rotherham (file image) The complaints came in the wake of the Jay Report, which described how 1,400 children, mainly girls, were routinely raped, trafficked and groomed in South Yorkshire between 1997 and 2013 . It said in a statement: 'The complaints contain more than 100 allegations against 42 named police officers, both retired and serving, as well as a number of allegations against officers whose identities are currently unknown.' The complaints followed on from the Jay Report, which described how at least 1,400 children were raped, trafficked and groomed in the South Yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013. The IPCC statement said: 'Work to establish the identity of the unknown officers and to identify any links between the different complaints and incidents is ongoing. 'The allegations range from neglect of duty by failing to adequately investigate on the basis of intelligence or to deal with incidents appropriately, inappropriate comments and suggestions of corrupt relationships between police officers and offenders.' The commission said it was also investigating an allegation that South Yorkshire Police failed to act on information passed to them in 2004 and 2006 about alleged child abuse in nearby Sheffield. This complaint relates to two named police officers who are now retired from the police service, the IPCC said. The Jay Report, published in August last year, sparked furious debate about the tragic crimes which took place in Rotherham, and how the perpetrators went unchallenged for so long. The Jay report found that the abuse went unchallenged as police and council chiefs were afraid of being labelled racist, as the perpetrators were largely gangs of Asian men . Professor Alexis Jay, who wrote the report, described how hundreds of vulnerable teenagers, mainly girls, were routinely exploited by gangs of mainly Asian men with impunity. Police and senior council officers were accused of failing to tackle the problem for fear of being seen as racist, and of ignoring or doubting the victim's accounts. A wave of high profile resignations followed and the National Crime Agency was brought in to investigate the crimes and how they were handled. The Jay Report was followed by another report by Louise Casey, which was scathing in its criticism of Rotherham Council and led to the replacement of the local authority's ruling cabinet with commissioners appointed by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. After more revelations about the scale of exploitation in neighbouring Sheffield, the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Alan Billings, last month called for a wide-ranging inspection of his force, along the lines of Ms Casey's review of the council's actions.","Independent Police Complaints Commission was investigating ten officers .

"Talk about taking winter sports to the next level. Hundreds of daredevil snow kite boarders, and their brightly-coloured array of kites, recently descended on Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia, for the World Snow Kiting Championships. The extreme athletes lit up the cloudy sky as they carved their way through the snow, making for a highly unusual, but stunning winter sight. Hundreds of daredevil snow kite boarders recently descended on Siberia, Russia, for the World Snow Kiting Championships . The brightly swirling foil kites lit up the cloudy winter sky as the extreme athletes created a stunning visual display against the stark snow . The sport sees the boarders perform stunts and tricks by utilising the strong winter winds to help them glide along snow or ice. This year, the competition was held on the frozen waters of the Obskoye Water Reserve, where Russian photographer, Ilnar Salakhiev, 40, managed to capture the riders in action as their bold foil kites garnered dangerously high speeds. Participant Andrew Muse, a 26-year-old extreme sports enthusiast from Utah, was on hand on for the spectacular visual display. 'The ability to go up hills or mountains and snowboard down or just legitimately fly off them is the most amazing feeling,' he said. 'I have had an incredible amount of adventures and small world experiences,' he continued. 'I'm 26 and doing my best to live the happiest, most adventurous life possible.' And competing in such an extreme activity is just one such way that Muse ensures he lives life to the fullest. He first began snow kiting in 2011 when, rather than driving or catching the bus, Muse decided to hitchhike his way to the canyons in his native Utah. The sport sees the boarders perform stunts and tricks by utilising the strong winter winds to help them glide along the snow or ice . Champion snow kite boarder, Mila Poliakova, knows a thing or two about gathering high speeds with the help of the kite . This year, the competition was held on the frozen waters of the Obskoye Water Reserve, where a Russian photographer captured it all . Among the participants was 26-year-old Andrew Muse, an extreme sports enthusiast, from Utah in the United States . For Muse, his introduction to the sport began in his home state, back in 2011, when he asked to hitchhike a ride to a local mountain . The daredevil athlete wound up meeting a surfer from Maui who introduced him to the weird and wonderful world of snow kite boarding . Muse describes the feeling of being able to go up mountains and legitimately 'fly' off of them as 'the most amazing feeling' 'I was just looking for an adventure when this kid from Maui picked me up as he was headed to the same mountain. 'We ended up riding together for the day. Later in the afternoon, he asked if I wanted to try kiteboarding.' Though Muse had only seen the sport on the internet, he thought it just might be something that he would love. 'From that day on, I knew it was something I was going to pursue with a passion.' Andrew's passion for the mountains has not only fueled his love for the extreme sport, but also has helped repair family ties. After taking a ski patrol course the following summer, Muse took his mother, a former drug addict and alcoholic, rock climbing. 'This showed her that she could experience happiness without being high,' he explained. 'She got sober and I went to New Hampshire to ski patrol.' Ever since 2011, Muse has been pursuing snowkiting with a passion, even going so far as to become qualified in ski patrol . Among some of the stranger sights captured by Russian photographer, Ilnar Salakhiev, was a snow kite boarder in full bear costume . While Muse - and the other competitors - love the rush associated with snowkiting, they do admit that the sport can be dangerous . Snow kites aren't designed for heights of more than about 300 feet, so competitors must remain be aware of how high they 'fly' into the air . At high altitudes, there is always a possibility that the kites may fail - but Muse still doesn't regret any part of his snowkiting journey . Poliakova, who hails from Moscow, shows off her massive, lightweight kite, which sticks out noticeably among the expanse of white snow . Eight competitors, pictured here, move in impressive sync as they hold on to the brightly coloured contraptions supporting them . After seeing his family life turn around, Andrew's focus is now on his snowkiting career fueled by an overriding ambition to compete professionally. 'The last snowkiting trip I went on has to be the most dangerous thing I've ever done,' he recalled. 'At some points, I was over 300 feet off the ground and kites aren't really designed for that kind of height, so if one part of the system failed I could have died.' Still, he doesn't regret a moment. 'It's what I love. I'd really like to compete and take my snowkiting career to the next level,' he added. 'It's just a matter of getting to a competition and having the funding to do so.'","Hundreds of daredevil snow boarders, and their bright array of kites, recently descended on Siberia, Russia .

"A woman from south-east China has caused a heated online debate after posting a picture of her breakfast of braised mice, served up by her mother. A resident of Fuzhou in Fujian Province, the woman, who is simply known as Miss Chen, said her mother insisted on her finishing a bowl of mice that morning before she rushed to work. She said her mother believed she was looking jaded and the dish would help as it was 'highly nutritious', reported the People's Daily Online. Yuk: Miss Chen is forced to eat this bowl of braised mice as breakfast by her mother, who believes one mouse contains the nutrition of three chickens . Miss Chen said at first she thought they were braised rabbits. After realising they were mice, she refused to eat, but her mum pressured her to eat them all. 'My mum said it was a great effort to pluck out all the hair from these mice,' said Miss Chen. 'She said it's hard work.' She ate all mice reluctantly with her eyes shut, and she said she felt sick all morning. Delicacy: Mice, especially dried mice jerky, are one of the eight treasured foods in western Fujian province. Locals believe eating rodents can treat hair loss . Mice are one of the eight treasured delicacies in western Fujian, with dried mice jerky being especially popular. Miss Chen said her family believes one mouse is as notorious as three chickens. Residents in Fuzhou also think that eating mice can help treat hair loss. Local experts however warn against the consumption of rodents. Lecturer Chen from the School of Life and Science at Fujian University said the small mammal can be the carrier of more than a dozen of germs and this might harm diners' health.","Young woman from China posted a picture of her breakfast of bowl of mice .

"It was a simple question; what are you going to buy your mum this Mother's Day? Unfortunately, Penguin Books UK decided to pose it to Twitter users alongside the hashtag #yourmum.

"Elvis Presley had one; so did Clark Gable. It was even the sedan of presidents. Then the name vanished amid an invasion of newer luxury cars from Europe and Asia. Now, the Lincoln Continental is back. Thirteen years after the last Continental rolled off the assembly line, Ford Motor Co. is resurrecting its storied nameplate. The new Continental debuts in concept form at this week's New York auto show. The production version of the full-size sedan goes on sale next year. Scroll down for video . Design: The emblem is illuminated along with the front headlamps on a Lincoln Continental concept car at the New York International Auto Show at the Javits Center on Monday . New look: The concept car being unveiled Monday in New York is painted a deep Prussian blue, a homage to Continentals of the 1950s and 1960s . Features: The driver's seat has a patented split cushion, so if the driver holds one leg out further than another, it will support each leg separately. The moonroof glass turns opaque with the touch of a button . All in the details: The Lincoln logo is seen on a passenger's side front wheel for the concept vehicle (left), and the Continental name also appears on the driver's side door (right) Gleaming: The emblem for a Lincoln Continental shines on the grill of Ford's concept car at the New York International Auto Show . Switch-up: The Continental is expected to replace the seven-year-old MKS, which currently sits atop Lincoln's car lineup . Luxury item: Both Elvis Presley and Clark Gable once owned Lincoln Continentals . Overseas appeal: In China, customers know the Continental name and appreciate brands with a rich history . After more than a decade of toying with alphabetical names like LS and MKS to be more like its foreign rivals, Ford's 98-year-old Lincoln brand is embracing its heritage. It's a measure of the growing confidence at Lincoln, which is finally turning around a decades-long sales decline. And it's a nod to the importance of China, where customers know the Continental name and appreciate brands with a rich history. Ford CEO Mark Fields says the Continental always represented the best of Lincoln. Resurrecting it sets higher expectations, both within the company and outside of it. 'When we get a chance to work on an iconic nameplate like that, it's a mixture of pride and a mixture of fear, because when you put that name out there, it's got to deliver,' Fields told The Associated Press in a recent interview.

Thrilled by the reception he got as he drove the elegant sedan around Palm Beach, Edsel made the Continental part of Lincoln's lineup. The Continental soon became the pinnacle of American luxury. Warner Brothers gave Elizabeth Taylor a 1956 Continental with a custom paint color to match her eyes. A darker historical note: John F. Kennedy was riding in the back of a 1961 Continental convertible when he was assassinated in Dallas. Continental sales peaked in 1990 at 62,732. But after that, Lincoln's sales began slipping.

A production version of the Lincoln Continental being debuted at the New York Auto Show this week will go on sale next year . History: Visitors to the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace get a look at the limousine that was built in 1967 for President Lyndon B. Johnson in August 1996. The modified Lincoln Continental was used by U.S. Presidents, including Nixon, until it was retired in 1978 . Ford had acquired other luxury brands such as Jaguar and Volvo. Lincoln's designs got dull and failed to stand out from lower-priced Fords. The Continental was also squeezed by competition from the midsize Lincoln LS, which debuted in 2000, and the bigger Town Car. Ford also underestimated the threat posed by German rivals, who were expanding their lineups, and newer Japanese luxury brands. By 2000, Lexus was the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S.; last year, BMW was. To make its way back, Lincoln isn't trying isn't trying to be sporty like BMW or showy like Cadillac. Instead, Fields says, it wants to give drivers an experience that is elegant and serene. 'We want folks to get into our vehicles and — for lack of a better term — chill,' Fields said. It appears to be working. Lincoln's U.S. sales rose 16 percent last year, making it one of the fastest-growing luxury brands in the market. The midsize MKZ was the brand's top seller. Full-size sedans like the Continental are a tough sell in the U.S., where buyers tend to prefer midsize sedans or SUVs. U.S. sales of Lincoln's current full-size sedan, the MKS, fell 24 percent last year. Disco era: The 1972 Lincoln Continental Mark IV is seen here. Continental sales peaked in 1990 at 62,732.

Cruising: A 2000 Lincoln Continental races down a road. The Continental was squeezed by competition from the midsize Lincoln LS, which debuted in 2000, and the bigger Town Car . But globally, the segment is growing, Fields says. Ford has high hopes for the Lincoln brand in China, where it's opening dazzling new dealerships complete with waterfalls. Ford began selling Lincolns in China late last year, and the company will open more than 20 dealerships there this year. The concept car being unveiled Monday in New York is painted a deep Prussian blue, an homage to Continentals of the 1950s and 1960s. But there are few other references to its history. Lincoln's split-wing grille, a feature that dates to the 1940s, has been replaced by a tight, rectangular mesh grille, its shiny chrome patterned with tiny versions of Lincoln's rectangular logo. The sides are smooth; even the door handles are hidden within a narrow strip of chrome at the beltline. The concept is a technology showcase. The driver's seat has a patented split cushion, so if the driver holds one leg out further than another, it will support each leg separately. The moonroof glass turns opaque with the touch of a button. Another button automatically moves the front passenger seat forward and fully reclines the rear passenger seat. That's another nod to China, where luxury car owners often have their own drivers. Under the hood is a 3-liter V6 EcoBoost engine that's unique to Lincoln. Ford isn't yet revealing more details, like whether the car is front- or rear-wheel drive. The Continental switched to a front-wheel-drive sedan in the 1980s, but many of its current competitors — the Infiniti Q70, Mercedes Benz S-Class and Lexus LS — are rear-wheel drive. The Continental is expected to replace the seven-year-old MKS, which currently sits atop Lincoln's car lineup.","Thirteen years after the last Continental rolled off the assembly line, Ford Motor Co. is resurrecting its storied nameplate .

"A damning new report has uncovered a string of safety concerns and examples of poor hygiene at homeless shelters across New York City that in many cases have people living in conditions little better than what they would find on the street. The Department of Homeless Services spends $360 million a year housing nearly 12,000 homeless families with children in largely privately-run shelters described as decrepit and dangerous in the Department of Investigation report released on Thursday. 'At its worst, DHS is turning a blind eye to violations that threaten the lives of shelter residents,' the report said, calling for repairs, stiffer inspections and new mechanisms to compel fixes. The shocking findings included one family of six living in a homeless-shelter apartment where a dead rat festered on the floor for two days (stock photo) The shocking findings included one family of six living in a homeless-shelter apartment where a dead rat festered on the floor for two days. Another family had no living-room furniture and had been without electricity for days. At a different homeless family shelter, a puddle of urine soiled the floor of the only working elevator. And at yet another, one stairway was so treacherously rusted that inspectors ordered guards to block access to it until it was repaired. To make matter worse, all those buildings are part of a system in which the department is often paying well above neighborhood market rates for apartments. The homeless services agency said it had already axed some unacceptable apartments from the system, stepped up inspections and asked for money to hire 19 new inspection staffers, among other steps. While that's progress, 'much work still needs to be done,' Department of Investigation Commissioner Mark Peters said in a statement. New York City is legally obligated to provide shelter to all homeless people and has long grappled with how to house them. The Auburn Family Residence in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. In February 2014 Mayor de Blasio announced that he was removing hundreds of children from it after inspectors repeatedly cited deplorable living conditions . The problem has grown more acute as the numbers of people seeking shelter rose from an average of about 39,000 a night in the start of 2010 to over 60,000 this past November, according to the most recent data the nonprofit Coalition for the Homeless has gathered from city agencies. Conditions in some family homeless shelters were bleakly spotlighted in December 2013, when The New York Times profiled an 11-year-old girl who lived amid mice, rotting walls and communal bathrooms in a Brooklyn shelter that no longer houses children. Mayor Bill de Blasio took office the next month and asked for an investigation. In February 2014 de Blasio announced that he was removing over 400 children from two city-owned homeless shelters - the Auburn Family Residence in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and from the Catherine Street shelter in Lower Manhattan - that inspectors had repeatedly cited for deplorable conditions. Investigators inspected 25 of the over 140 family shelters last spring and summer. They range from converted hospitals and schools with on-site social services to single-room occupancy hotels and 'cluster sites:' apartments within buildings that also house private tenants. The 'cluster sites' proved particularly deplorable, the report said. Inspectors reported roaches crawling on the walls, holes in the corners and unlocked front doors with inadequate security in lobbies of buildings with histories of shootings and other crimes. Garbage was piled in halls, beds were broken and there were rats, including the reeking, dead one that had lingered for two days, the report said. The city pays an average of $2,450 a month for cluster site apartments, while the average rent in some of their neighborhoods is $1,200 a month and lower, the report said. But even some better-equipped shelters had fire code violations and other problems, including the rusted-out stairwell, the report said. It was one of two in a 140-family building. The homeless services agency had known the stairway was deteriorating since 2012 and tried to get money to fix it. Ultimately, the city spent $637,000 for the guards who were ordered after the DOI inspection, plus over $750,000 to fix the stairs. They reopened in September.","The Department of Homeless Services spends $360 million a year housing nearly 12,000 homeless families in largely privately-run shelters .

"The soaring value of the pound has provided a major boost for British holidaymakers. Breaks in Europe have become more affordable as sterling has risen strongly against the euro and other currencies. It means trippers get nearly 15 per cent more for their money than a year ago, according to the Post Office Travel Money City Costs Barometer. Last month the pound hit a seven-year high against the euro at 1.35 euros, knocking about £70 off the cost of a £500 trip compared with 2014. Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, offers bargain hunters the best value as a city break destination, says a study . Budapest, Hungary, also offers British travellers a great deal, with a weekend getaway tallying £119.77 . However, a trip to the US has become significantly more expensive, with £500 buying only $722.45, down from $797 a year ago. City breaks have overtaken beach holidays as the most popular getaway choice for British tourists, according to a new study. With the pound strengthening against the euro and other currencies, prices have dropped by as much as 22 per cent over last year in three quarters of the cities included in Post Office Travel Money's annual report on city costs. Eastern European cities offer bargain hunters the best value with Vilnius, Lithuania, topping the list. The newest eurozone member has seen a fall of over 15 per cent year-on-year with a three-course evening meal for two including drinks and two nights' accommodation coming in at just £100.04. The cost of a weekend break in Vilnius is half of what visitors would pay in perennial favourites Paris, Rome and Amsterdam. Budapest is another great money-saving destination, where a two night getaway comes in at just £119.77. And in Riga, travellers will not only benefit from cheap transport options, but also the cheapest rate (£36) for a two-night stay in a three-star city centre hotel during the month of April. In Riga, Estonia, not only is transport extremely affordable, but three-star city centre hotels are cheapest . And when it comes to Western Europe, Post Office Travel Money recommends heading to Athens for a deal . 1. Vilnius, Lithuania - £100.04 . 2. Budapest, Hungary - £119.77 . 3. Riga, Latvia - £120.39 . 4. Tallinn, Estonia - £131.28 . 5. Athens, Greece - £131.35 . 6. Dubrovnik, Croatia - £139.83 . 7. Prague, Czech Republic - £141.24 . 8. Lisbon, Portugal - £141.37 . 9. Krakow, Poland - £144.96 . 10. Strasbourg, France - £169.60 . *Cost of two nights' accommodation and a three-course meal for two with drinks . But it's not only Eastern Europe that offers UK tourists some serious value. Athens, which is a new entry in the report, comes in fifth with a weekend city break coming in at just £131.35, which puts it as the cheapest in Western Europe. Last year's cheapest Western break, Lisbon, dropped to eighth place this year. The Czech city of Prague also offers great bang for a British traveller's buck, boasting cheap meals and drinks. Dining out costs as little as £23.94 for two people, while a bottle of beer is just £1.13. Krakow, Poland, and Strasbourg, France, are two additional new entries to the list this year. Proving that not all French cities must be needlessly expensive, Strasbourg is noteworthy for being 35 per cent cheaper than Paris. For the third consecutive year, Stockholm is Europe's most expensive city with holidaymakers spending an average of £311.01 for a two-night getaway. London is the seventh most expensive city break, with costs averaging £266.65, according to the study. While perennial favourite, Paris, is a very expensive French destination, Strasbourg offers good value . If money is not a concern, Stockholm has been named Europe's most expensive city for the third year in a row . Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'It's a win/win situation for UK holidaymakers this year in European cities because prices are down in the majority of cities we surveyed, thanks to the soaring value of sterling.' However, he does recommend that travellers do their homework before setting out, as prices do vary significantly across cities. 'Remember that the cost of meals and drinks will need to be added into the spending budget, as city breaks are never all-inclusive holidays,' he explains. 'Over the course of a two- or three-night break, these can make a big difference to the cost of a city break and the low prices in Prague, Athens and Budapest will make these cities strong contenders for a bargain break rival to the Baltic states.'","Weekend breaks have overtaken beach holidays as most popular getaway .

"Young British sportscar driver Jann Mardenborough has been involved in a crash in a race in Germany which has resulted in the death of a spectator.

The tower suddenly darkened as Earth Hour swept across China as it made its way across 24 different time zones . The lights were switched off on the Old Bridge in Mostar, southern Bosnia, creating a serene view from this hill next to the river running through the city . The 101 building in Taipei also switched off its lights to mark the annual event, which is marked by conservation organisation WWF . The business district in Jakarta, Indonesia, also darkened as more than 700 landmarks worldwide took part in Earth Hour . He said: 'Switching off the lights for Earth Hour is a statement of intent by everyone who takes part, making them part of a community which recognises that we really do have one planet and that we have it not just for ourselves but also for our children and grandchildren. 'It is a symbolic and powerful reminder that together we have the power to change things. It should also remind us that we do not have much time in which to make those changes. If everyone in the world consumed natural resources at the rate we do in the United Kingdom we would need three planets and not just one to support us.' 'The impacts - not least climate change, deforestation, overfishing, and the loss of numerous species for whom this planet should also be there - are already starting to affect us all. 'WWF works hard to address many of the environmental issues we face on our planet but Earth Hour is a chance for everyone to show that they care and are willing to do their bit to help because collective action has never been more vital. Last year over nine million people took part in Earth Hour in the UK.' 'They joined more than 1,000 businesses and organisations as well as the 4,600 schools which participated alongside some of the country's best known landmarks including Buckingham Palace, Edinburgh Castle, Tower Bridge, the Senedd, and Wembley Stadium.'","Some of Britain's most iconic landmarks were plunged into darkness  to raise awareness of climate change .

"New satellite images taken above Syria have revealed the scale of the devastation in the country following four years of civil war. Schools, hospitals and refugee camps are seen destroyed in towns and cities such as Aleppo, Kobane, Homs and ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa since the country was torn apart in 2011. Initially a battle between various armed rebel groups and the Syrian regime forces, the Syrian Civil War has since descended into a conflict with hundreds of frontlines, as rebel groups fight among themselves and ISIS and Al Qaeda-backed terrorists seize vast swathes of land. Scroll down for video . Before: This photograph showing the area around Aleppo's old citadel was taken of November 21, 2010 - a year before the Syrian Civil War broke out . And after: On October 22, 2014 - less than four years after the above image was captured - the area around Aleppo's citadel is seen largely destroyed . Monument: This photograph taken on October 12, 2011 shows the elaborate shrine to ancient Islamic icons Uwais al-Qurani and Ammar Ibn Yasser in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa . Destroyed: The monument - which lies in ISIS-held territory - was sadly destroyed by militants in 2013 who said it distracted from the veneration of Allah. This photograph was taken on October 6, 2014 . The satellite images form part a UN report due for release tomorrow that will present analysis of the impact of four years of war on the Middle Eastern nation. UN investigators used their satellite program UNOSAT to gather the startling photographs which, according to an advance statement detailing the report, document 'indiscriminate attacks on civilian population, including barrel bombing, destruction of schools, hospitals, residential areas, markets, power plants and the vast cultural heritage of Syria.' Comparing images taken shortly before the start of the war in 2011 with those captured in recent months, the UN has been able to show the geographical changes caused by relentless fighting between various groups, as well as the displacement of an estimated 6.5 million people. The images emerged as the Syrian air force has carried out a chlorine gas attack on a northern town, killing six people, according to activists, as Amnesty International said separate government air strikes on the Islamic State 'capital' could amount to war crimes. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Co-ordination Committees said gas attacks on the town of Samrin injured dozens more people. Historic: This photograph dated September 4, 2011 shows the ancient Syrian border city of Dura-Europos, which was considered a UNESCO world heritage site . Target: Holes in the ground around Dura-Europos reveal the extent of looting in the area by April 2, 2014 . An opposition official in the area of this morning's chlorine gas release said there were two attacks - the first targeting rebels while the second hit a residential area. He said the six killed were members of the same family, including three children. A military official denied the claims and blamed rebels fighting to topple President Bashar Assad. Earlier, Amnesty International said air strikes on the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa on November 25 killed dozens of civilians. The human rights group said it had documented a series of Syrian government air strikes between November 11 and November 29 that killed up to 115 civilians - including 14 children -  in the city. Raqqa has been ISIS' seat since it declared a caliphate in areas under its control in Iraq and Syria. Amnesty International said the 'unlawful' killings violated international humanitarian law and some of the attacks could amount to war crimes. The London-based group said the air strikes included attacks on a mosque and a busy market 'crammed full of civilians' as well as some buildings not being used for military purposes. Clear: The satellite images form part a UN report due for release tomorrow that will present analysis of the impact of four years of war on the Middle Eastern nation . Ravaged: Schools, hospitals and refugee camps are seen destroyed in towns and cities such as Aleppo, Kobane, Homs and ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa since the country was torn apart in 2011 . Philip Luther, director of Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa programme, said: 'Syrian government forces have shown flagrant disregard for the rules of war in these ruthless air strikes. Some of these attacks give every indication of being war crimes. 'They have carried out repeated attacks on civilian areas without clearly identifying military targets, a blatant violation of the requirement to distinguish between civilians and military targets.' Syrian authorities said at the time that the attacks were meant to target IS members and bases, but Amnesty said the evidence it gathered shows that, in most cases, no military targets could be identified. On November 25, Syrian government forces bombed a number of civilian areas, striking a mosque, a busy market, shops, a transport hub, a storage facility and a residential building, Amnesty said. Mr Luther said: 'The residents of Raqqa already have to endure the reality of life under brutal IS rule. Punishing an entire civilian population simply because the city where they live is now under IS control can never be justified.'","Photos taken for new UN report show destruction of Syria's geography .

"An Australian teenager who lost contact with family and friends when Cyclone Pam struck Vanuatu last week, has now been found. 18-year-old Zoe Marshall was spotted by Australian search helicopters on Pentecost Island this morning and was able to speak to her relieved family by phone. Her father, Rob Marshall, says she is 'safe and well' even though helicopters were unable to lift her and fellow volunteer, New Zealander Courtney Tilby, to safety because they were too close to a cliff. Zoe Marshall (pictured on the day she left for Vanuatu) has been found safe and well by rescue helicopters in Vanuatu. Zoe was volunteering for the charity Latitude near Namaram, on the island of Pentecost, when Cyclone Pam struck the islands . Rescue helicopters reportedly dropped a note to Ms Marshall and Ms Tilby with instructions on where to walk to safer ground so that they could be reached by rescuers today the Canberra Times reports. Zoe's father Rob tweeted this morning  that his daughter was seen 'smiling and waving' by the helicopter. Using the hashtag #proudolddad he passed on one of the messages the family  received from Zoe today. 'I really want to go back; I love my family and the kids. There's a lot to do out there,' she wrote . Ms Marshall was one of nineteen volunteer teachers who were unaccounted for after the category five cyclone swept through Vanuatu on March 13. Five of the volunteers were evacuated by Australian consular officials on Thursday and another eight people are expected to be rescued today, the Department of Foreign Affairs says. Until today, the family in Canberra hadn't heard from their daughter since  the storm struck the islands. 'I love you more than most things': This was the last text message Alison Abernethy received from her daughter, Zoe Marshall, before the cyclone struck Vanuatu last week . As the cyclone approached, the aspiring engineering student had told her parents in a text message that the village was well-prepared and that it 'should be fine'. 'Sorry for the early text but don't know when phone will work. We've got cat 5 warning. Should hit us tonight. Should be all good,' she said. She said a rat had chewed part of her sandal and, to her parents' amusement, she pledged to fill the rat's nest with rocks after the storm passed. Zoe, who her mother Alison Abernethy describes as a teenager with 'a strong social conscience,' was donating her time to young people on the island, living in a village with 'limited electricity, no running water and pit toilets. Ms Abernethy told Daily Mail Australia her daughter would have tried to contact them if she could. 'She would have known that we're really worried about her,' Ms Abernethy had said, but it didn't help that she was staying in an 'incredibly remote' location. 'If you find her, just hand her a SatPhone or take a photo so that we know she's alive,' her mother had written in a blog post titled 'Where's my girl?' on Wednesday. Students and teachers at Vanuatu's Central School in Port Vila have put hundreds of books out to dry in the sunshine . The school's library was flooded after the roof was blown away in last week's cyclone . As rescue efforts for those still missing continue, the rest of the country is trying to rebuild. Heart warming pictures of students in Vanuatu laying books out in the sun to dry so they can return to school have emerged. The pictures show hundreds of books from the Central School library, which was blown away in the storm, littered across the schoolyard. Reportedly, students, teachers and school headmaster Paul Alexander Hatyay  went to the effort of putting the books out so that they can be put to good use in the classroom again as soon as possible.

"Whem he hosted University Challenge, his catchphrase was ‘Your starter for ten’. But the stakes have suddenly become higher for Bamber Gascoigne – after he unexpectedly inherited an historic mansion from an elderly aunt. He was stunned to be left 50-bedroom West Horsley Place in Surrey by the Duchess of Roxburghe, one-time society beauty and a goddaughter of George V’s wife Queen Mary. Bamber Gascoigne, seen in a library at West Horsely house, has embarked on a mission to save the crumbling estate, which could be worth £10million once the restoration has been completed . The Duchess – Lady Mary Evelyn Hungerford Crewe-Milnes – was also Mr Gascoigne’s godmother and had no children of her own. She died last year aged 99. The grand country house dates from the 11th century, although most of it was built between the 15th and 18th centuries. It had many visits from royalty, including one by Henry VIII, during which he enjoyed a 35-course lunch. Later, it was occupied by Carew Raleigh, son of Sir Walter Raleigh. Legend has it that he carried Sir Walter’s embalmed head in a bag at the house after Sir Walter was beheaded. Mr Gascoigne, 80, who presented University Challenge for 25 years until 1987, had no idea he was to inherit the Grade I listed pile, until a solicitor contacted him. Home: The former University Challenge host has inherited West Horsley Place near Leatherhead in Surrey . The 50-room house was left to Gascoigne by his aunt and godmother, the Duchess of Roxburghe (pictured), who was one of the train-bearers for Queen Elizabeth at the 1937 Coronation of King George VI . Bamber Gascoigne, pictured with his wife Christina, has ‘accidentally’ inherited an historic stately home . His aunt had apparently expected him to sell it because of the costly restoration work it needed. But the broadcaster and his wife Christina have embarked on a mission to save the crumbling estate. The house could be worth £10million once the restoration has been completed. They plan to finance the work by selling an estimated £2.2million of jewels, paintings, furniture and artefacts, which they found in the house. The 700 lots will be auctioned by Sotheby’s in May. Mr Gascoigne is committed to ensuring his aunt’s house ‘continues to stand as a monument of its remarkable past’, and hopes eventually to open it to the public. ‘It was completely unexpected by me that I would be heir to her estate,’ he told The Sunday Telegraph. ‘She had expressed that, given the work required to restore the house, she expected I would sell it. ‘But it’s such an incredible place and we knew it well, so the idea of immediately selling it seemed not only amazingly foolish but also missing the fun that was involved.’","Bamber Gascoigne, 80, has been left a 50-room stately home by his aunt .

"A man who allegedly tied weights to his dog's hind legs, beat him and dragged him through the streets has been charged with animal cruelty. Fabian Santiago, 20, was arrested Thursday in Manassas, Virginia, after a photo of him walking the animal caught the attention of police. A concerned bystander who saw Santiago out with the animal last month, posted a photograph, which was shared repeatedly on social media, and eventually came to the attention of authorities. Busted: Fabian Santiago was arrested for tying weights to his dog's hind legs after police saw the above photo gaining attention online . Speaking to local Fox station WTTG, a Manassas City Police spokesman said the woman who posted the photo also called them. The spokesman said: 'The witness told us that she had seen the owner striking the dog with his hand while walking him, he had also ties weights to the dog's legs. 'The dog was on a leash so he was essentially pulling the dog.' Manassas City Police said Santiago explained what he was doing - but would not reveal what his reason was. However, a police spokesman said the practice is typical in animals being trained for dog-fighting. The dog, who was not badly hurt, is being cared for by Santiago's family while he awaits his court date next month.","Fabian Santiago, 20, was arrested Thursday in Manassas, Virginia .

"A quadruple amputee Rottweiler named Brutus is getting the chance to walk again thanks to a new set of artificial limbs. Brutus, who lives in Loveland, Colorado, is only the second dog to ever have four prosthetic limbs. The dog became disabled after he got frostbite on all four paws and was maimed by his breeder, who tried to amputate the damage himself. Scroll down for video . A quadruple amputee Rottweiler named Brutus is getting the chance to walk again thanks to a new set of artificial limbs . Brutus, who lives in Loveland, Colorado, is only the second dog to ever have four prosthetic limbs . But now Brutus has a loving foster mother in Laura Aquilina, who is training the dog so he can get used to a life with artificial limbs. 'You can't explain to an animal why you are putting these contraptions on their feet,' she told Fox 31 Denver. 'You can't explain it to them, that it's to help them.' Brutus' new limbs, which he was outfitted with in September 2014, gives him a high step that  resembles a 'bucking bronco'. Although Brutus can now take walks outside, Aquilina wants more for the two-year-old dog. 'It's not always pretty,' she said. 'We want to be able to give him a higher function where he can run and play with other dogs, go on hikes.' Brutus' foster mother Laura Aquilina (pictured) is training the two-year-old dog so he can get used to life with prosthetic limbs.

He will soon undergo physical therapy and get an improved set of prosthetics . Aquilina has Brutus do exercises and play outside so that he can become better at balance. And the dog will soon undergo physical therapy and get an improved set of prosthetics to boot. Brutus' artificial limbs were made by OrthoPets of Denver, which makes prosthetics for about 250 animals around the world every year. OrthoPets founder Martin Kauffman said Brutus was 'dealt a short hand' but can now  'get out and do normal doggy things'. 'It just makes you feel so good,' he told Fox 31 Denver. Aquilina said Brutus is an example of why people shouldn't give up on animals with disabilities. 'If he ended up in a shelter they'd say he was unadoptable because he's missing his feet,' she said. 'I think its good for people to know we can work with animals like this.'

"The mother and caregiver of an autistic man, who also has cerebral palsy, have been charged after he was hospitalized and suffered from severe burns to his hand. Dyrue McGee, 24, from Pittsburgh was taken to the hospital last October after he was scalded on his right hand, which left severe injuries causing him to stay in treatment for 58 days. His mother, Vonda Brown, 44, allegedly submerged her adult son's hand into hot liquid while at their family home last year, and has been charged with aggravated assault. When McGee was taken to Ohio Valley Hospital in McKees Rocks on October 13 for treatment, he was screaming to be fed, as staff found him to be malnourished and only weighing 58-lbs, according to the Pittsburgh-Post Gazette. McGee has been taken into protective custody following the incident. The mother and caregiver of a 58-lb autistic man have been charged after he was hospitalized while malnourished and suffered from severe burns to his hand. Vonda Brown (left), 44, allegedly submerged her adult son's hand into hot liquid last October. McGee's full-time carer, Armando Navarro (right), 45, is accused of submitting false time sheets . A hospital spokesperson said when McGee arrived, the staff had concerns about his care and contacted authorities, according to CBS Pittsburgh. McGee's full-time carer, Armando Navarro, 45, who is reportedly in a relationship with Brown, has also been charged in the case. He is accused of submitting false time sheets so that he could get paid for work that he did not do while McGee was in hospital. Both Brown and Navarro have claimed McGee was 'constantly eating', however his malnutrition was evident of a 'chronic constant abuse situation', according to the criminal complaint. Brown also denied the accusations that she caused abuse to her son's hand, saying that she had discovered it after she removed the sock that she had previously placed on it. She said she had placed the sock on his hand to protect it when he becomes agitated and 'hits himself in the face'. However, doctors told officials her story was inconsistent with his wounds. A neighbor, who did not see Brown and McGee often, is shocked of the allegations. Bob White (pictured above) said he thought McGee was a child and that the neighborhood is 'devastated' Brown's son was able to receive a caregiver, who was Navarro, through the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which she helped coordinate and also reviews his time sheets. While McGee was in hospital, Navarro submitted false time sheets for 18 days, which he received $2,000 for those hours even though he did not work. However, he claims he still 'did work around the house', according to an affidavit. Dyrue McGee, 24, from Pittsburgh who has cerebral palsy, had to remain in hospital 58 days after he was scalded on his right hand while at his family home (the family home above on California Avenue) Navarro and Brown have both been charged with Medicaid fraud. A neighbor, who did not see Brown and McGee often, said he is shocked to learn of the allegations. Bob White said: 'We always thought it was a kid. We're devastated around here. We never knew anything like that could happen.' McGee has reportedly gained weight since being in protective custody, according to WTAE. Following their arrest on Wednesday, Navarro has been released while Brown remains in jail unable to post her $5,000 bond. A preliminary hearing is set to take place in two weeks.","Dyrue McGee, 24, from Pittsburgh was taken to hospital last October for treatment for burns but was also found to weigh only 58-lbs .

"An Israeli political candidate has come under fire after dressing up as an Islamic State captive as part of a traditional Jewish festival.

It mirrors similar images released by ISIS, which show their captives kneeling in the sand in the desert while extremists stand behind them. The picture came as Jews across the world celebrated the traditional festival of Purim, which is often marked with colourful costumes. Ms Roth then captioned the picture: 'This is what we’ll get if we don’t have a big Bayit Yehudi. Happy Purim!' The image has since been removed but according to the Jerusalem Post, the picture prompted an angry backlash on social media. Ms Roth, left, is a member of Israel's Zionist Bayit Yehudi party. Her costume was similar to those worn by captives of ISIS . Some wrote that Ms Roth should be ashamed of herself, however, her party supporters said her costume was funny. Ms Roth, is a former peace activist and was once an advisor to ex-Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak. Her party, Bayit Yehudi, which means The Jewish Home, is a successor to the National Religious Party. They firmly believe that Jewis are devinely commanded to retain control over the land of Israel. A group of Jewish men braved the snow storms in New York to walk to the synagogue to celebrate the Jewish festival of Purim . Meanwhile Jewish families transformed streets around the world as they dressed up as kings and queens, clown, animals and even superheroes to celebrate Purim. The holiday commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in ancient Persia after a beautiful queen, Esther, foiled a royal advisor's plot to annihilate all the country's Jews in just one day. It is traditionally marked with parades, the giving of presents, and by observers sporting a host of colourful costumes which traditionally take their cue from the Biblical story of Esther. Celebrations marked the holy day across the globe, and even the wintry weather in New York couldn't dampen spirits as families made their way to synagogues through the snow.","Anat Roth dressed up as part of traditional Jewish Purim celebrations .

"Jeremy Clarkson could return to Top Gear if he faces up to ‘his own shortcomings’, a senior BBC source hinted last night. The insider said the 54-year-old presenter, who is currently suspended after allegedly assaulting assistant producer Oisin Tymon, might be allowed to come back if he ‘sorted himself out’. The source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings. Scroll down for video . Suspended: A BBC insider has suggested Jeremy Clarkson (pictured at the Roundhouse theatre this week) might be allowed to come back if he 'sorted himself out' ‘He has a great deal of public support and of course that shouldn’t be ignored. But he does needs to rest and sort himself out.’ The remarks come after The Mail on Sunday provoked an outcry last week when we revealed that a BBC executive had likened Clarkson’s support from politicians to that given to paedophile Jimmy Savile. The Corporation is due to decide Mr Clarkson’s fate this week, after he was suspended pending an independent review into allegations surrounding the alleged assault. To the disappointment of millions of fans, Top Gear has also been taken off the air. The BBC and Clarkson have been locked into a bitter war of words since it emerged he had been involved in an altercation with Tymon reportedly sparked by a row over the lack of hot food at a hotel. The 54-year-old presenter (right) is currently suspended after allegedly assaulting assistant producer Oisin Tymon (left) During a briefing to this newspaper last week, a BBC executive also claimed the host was ‘self-destructing’ and should go into rehab. Since then, the Corporation and the presenter have refused to comment publicly about the affair. Clarkson does not deny ranting at the producer but other claims that he punched his colleague remain unsubstantiated. Ken MacQuarrie, head of BBC Scotland, who has been investigating the claims, is due to report to BBC director-general Lord Hall, who will then decide on the star’s fate. But a senior BBC source has now told the MoS there is a growing realisation within the Corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear off the air while an investigation was under way. He said: ‘The programme could have and should have carried on during Clarkson’s suspension.’ He declined to comment on suggestions that the star needed to spend time in rehab: ‘I think he kind of knows he has to sort himself out. I don’t know if he should go into rehab or not. It’s not for me to say.’ Last week, the MoS’s story showed the extent of BBC briefing against the highly-paid presenter, with an executive likening Tymon’s position to that of Savile’s victims who feared they would not be believed while he was alive. The executive said: ‘The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way. ‘If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile’s a real talent, Maria Miller is saying Savile will be Savile.’ The comments were strongly condemned by both Savile’s victims and a furious Clarkson, who has since called in lawyers in a bid to identify the source of the comparison. A BBC spokesman last night declined to comment on the idea that Clarkson could return to the Corporation. He said that it would not be offering ‘further commentary’ on the matter until Lord Hall had made his decision.","Presenter was suspended after allegedly assaulting producer Oisin Tymon .

"Twelve thrill-seekers were plucked from a high-speed rollercoaster at Universal Studios by firefighters today after a malfunction. The 'high-speed rampage' of a ride, which hits 67mph and goes upside-down seven times, came grinding to a halt Tuesday evening after a mechanism went wrong. Riders were left stuck on the tracks of the 16-year-old coaster, reportedly for around a quarter of an hour, while firefighters with cherry-pickers drove up to bring them down to safety. Stuck: The ride came to a halt in the Orlando theme park around 5pm Tuesday afternoon. A cherry-picker, which was used to get passengers off, can be seen to the right . Fixing up: 12 people were removed from the ride by firefighters, some of whom can still be seen investigating above . Local news station WESH2, which captured footage of firefighters aboard the empty cars not long after 5pm, said that nobody was hurt in the incident. Riders were left approximately 15ft off the ground while firefighters responded. In a statement given to the channel, Universal described the malfunction as a 'glitch', following which 'the ride did what it was supposed to do, and shut down'. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the theme park is not yet certain what went wrong, and has launched an investigation. The Hulk ride was built in 1999 at the Island of Adventure theme park, an expansion area which is next to the original Universal Studios, and costs a premium to enter.

"TOM JONES: THE LIFE . by Sean Smith . (HarperCollins £18.99) Tom Jones has been a genuine global star for half a century. How many other people can say that? By my reckoning, it’s no more than a handful: Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Clint Eastwood and HM The Queen. And only one of them, I believe, lives in a larger house than Sir Tom’s. Sir Tom Jones (pictured in Los Angeles in 1978) had his first No 1 in the UK in March 1965 . It was in March 1965 that his first hit, It’s Not Unusual, went to No 1 in the UK and made him famous. To this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded. Another significant milestone approaches on June 7, when he will turn 75 years old. All of which makes him the perfect subject for a lavishly appointed, no-holds-barred hardback biography. Smith’s is not the first — in fact, it’s the twelfth. But it’s the first for nearly two years, and should keep us going until the autumn, when Sir Tom’s autobiography is due out. What else will the great man be able to reveal, given that almost every imaginable revelation has already been made? Tom (pictured in early 1970s) married his wife Linda in 1957 when they were both only 16-years-old . For Sir Tom has not lived a particularly secretive life. Though married to Linda, nee Trenchard, for 58 years, and happily so, he has enjoyed a prolific extra-curricular love life. But as long as Linda doesn’t have to read about it in the newspaper — let’s hope she doesn’t read this — she turns a blind eye. It’s not just a matter of having your cake and eating it. It’s having more cake than anyone else has ever had and eating every last crumb of it. Such opportunities would never have arisen, of course, without the talent. Jones was born with the gift of a golden voice, and he knows exactly what to do with it. This was apparent on his first hit, and has not wavered since. Tom Jones (pictured) was born Thomas Woodward but was persuaded to change his name by his manager Gordon Mills, who also persuaded the star to move to London from Wales . Quite what he should do with his career has not always been so obvious but, under the watchful eye of his son, Mark, who has managed him since the mid-Eighties, he has recaptured his place in the sun and gained a new generation of fans. Several generations, in fact. The backstory is well known. Babies hear it on their mothers’ knees, and then tell it to their own babies many years later. Born Thomas Woodward in Treforest, South Wales, the infant Tom ‘had an edge, even as a youngster in short trousers. He didn’t just sing a song; he performed it with verve and passion’. Aged 12, he lost a year at school through tuberculosis; at 16, he was married with a child on the way. ‘Most of the girls found him very attractive,’ said one schoolmate. ‘He seemed a bit rough to me, but he definitely had the charisma. He had a way with him, a swagger.’ Tom Jones (right) is pictured with his manager, Gordon Mills (left), in January 1969. Mills worked as the superstar's manager for 20 years until he died of cancer in 1986 . The climb from obscurity, though, was long and arduous. Tom was a member of a band called The Senators, who weren’t going anywhere terribly fast. A sharp-eyed young manager, Gordon Mills, persuaded him to move to London, change his name to ‘Tom Jones’ and begin a solo career. He was already in his mid-20s. For 20 years, until Gordon died of cancer, Tom always deferred to his expertise. In return, Gordon did all Tom’s dirty work and sacked anyone who needed sacking. It was an arrangement that suited them both perfectly. Hits in the Sixties led to Las Vegas in the Seventies, and what might best be described as the Underwear Throwing Years. No bow-tie was larger or fluffier than Tom’s, no hips swivelled more suggestively. Elvis was a good friend and was convinced Tom wore a sock down the front of his trousers. Tom knew everyone and got on with nearly all of them, though he didn’t like it when John Lennon, with his characteristic Scouse wit, called him a ‘Welsh poof’. Would anyone? Tom (pictured) has been a judge on the Voice UK talent show since 2012, as has will.i.am (pictured) Nonetheless, an artistic nadir of some sort was reached when Tom recorded five consecutive country albums in the early Eighties. The live tours and Vegas residencies had made him hedge-fund rich. He and Linda lived in splendour in California, with many close relatives comfortably ensconced round the corner. But was it making him happy? Well, yes, but at the same time, Tom clearly needed to reconnect with the bluesier, rootsier music he had first loved. It hasn’t been an entirely easy ride since then, but his last two studio albums, Praise & Blame (2010) and Spirit In The Room (2012), have been the best of his long career. What comes over throughout the book is the straightforwardness of the man. Other stars say they might consider plastic surgery one day if the need arises, when they have clearly had the lot done. Sir Tom Jones has also had the lot done — but cheerfully admits to it. He has a reputation for being a little slow to put his hand in his pocket, yet is generous with family and close friends, as you or I would be in his position. He doesn’t like drugs or gambling, but enjoys a good cigar, and has drunk so much vintage champagne that at least one of his lovers was put off the stuff for good. Sir Tom (pictured), unlike many other celebrities, has admitted to having had plastic surgery work . Smith is an efficient chronicler of the life, as befits an old pro whose previous books have included Kylie, Gary (Barlow), Alesha (Dixon), Tulisa, Kate (Middleton), Cheryl and, of course, Victoria. There are a few factual errors that suggest speed of composition or just lack of knowledge: Leonard Cohen’s song is called Tower Of Song, not Tower Of Strength, for instance, and he doesn’t know that Burt Bacharach did not write the lyrics to his songs, which is a bit poor. But his book bounces along happily enough, forever marvelling that this faintly disgraceful old rake has been forgiven every-thing and become universally adored. As Rob Brydon put it when presenting him with yet another lifetime achievement award: ‘Tom Jones has lived the life we would all love to live.’ I have no doubt that women swooned and grown men wept, and Sir Tom probably sang It’s Not Unusual for about the 20,000th time.","Tom Jones turns 75 this year and has been a global star for half a century .

"American Apparel is trying to nip their dirty reputation in the bud. The clothing company long been known for their racy ads featuring what critics have said are underage looking girls in barely-there outfits with their nipples and even pubic hair in full view. In an attempt to distance themselves from their ousted 'sex-obsessed' former CEO Dov Charney and their infamous adverts, the company this week has begun photoshopping out some of the models' exposed nipples and body hair making them look more like plastic mannequins. Animal reports that the changes can be seen on the company's lingerie page in the 'new' section and a brunette model in translucent lingerie who once had more showing on Thursday was edited to be much less exposed. Scroll down for video . No nipple!: This American Apparel model in a translucent black bodysuit has a belly button but as of Thursday her nipples have been air brushed off in  what may be the company's attempt to re-brand their image . Charney's replacement CEO Paula Schneider has said she is attempting to make the brand 'relevant to millennials' without it bordering on 'pornographic.' 'This is an edgy brand and it’s always going to be an edgy brand, and it’s about social commentary, it’s about gay rights, and it’s about immigration reform. It’s about the things millennials care about,' Schneider told The New York Times in January. While many may welcome the company's attempt to shave away their previous image, some activists think showing nipple is perfectly fine and empowers women in what otherwise may be a mannequin's world. Michelle Lytle, co-founder of the nipple printed bikini line TaTa Top thinks that by censoring women and making them look like mannequins or dolls, the company is actually taking power away from women who should not feel ashamed of their bodies. Lytle told Animal that American Apparel has tried to reach out to diverse audiences by coming out with t-shirts that say 'legalize gay' and 'legalize LA' but have very little to comment on women's equality. 'To see them taking a strong stance on those issues but not on women’s equality is disappointing,' said Lytle who runs the feminist clothing line with her partner Robyn. 'This is a company that is clearly trying to distance themselves from their founder,' she continued. Nip no nip: The model on the left in see through white lingerie once had her nipples and pubic hair in full display more like the model in the back lingerie on the right . 'It’s kind of laughable for them to think that removing nipples from their images of their sheer lingerie is the best way to do this considering their questionable ad choices in recent years. This is a step in the wrong direction and is contributing to the sexualisation of a woman’s body at a time where there is a large and growing movement for equality.' The clothing company has a tab on their website dedicated to political activism and they offer a stance on gay rights and immigration reform. 'As a company, we have certain resources that individual activists do not. We try to use that special ability to support political causes that need help. American Apparel regularly uses its billboards, advertisements, press contacts and even printed t-shirts to speak out about important issues. Our two biggest issues have been Immigration Reform and Gay Rights,' says their website. The company's female CEO has yet to comment on women's sexuality and empowerment and the company's choice to airbrush out nipples and pubic hair. It may be that the company needs to focus their opinion on the difference between what sexusualises women and what censors them if there is a difference at all. Will American Apparel decide to free the nipple along with their old image? Seeing change (but no nipples): This model is clearly wearing a transparent nightgown but her nipples have been airbrushed out of the advertisement .

"A tooth belonging to a Peking Man – an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago - has been re-discovered after being lost for decades. It was found in one of 40 forgotten boxes at the Museum of Evolution at Uppsala University, Sweden, allowing scientists to re-examine it using modern techniques. From wear-and-tear on the canine tooth, they say that the individual it belonged to was quite old when she died and probably  gnawed on bones and crunched on hard nuts. A tooth belonging to the Peking Man – an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago - has been re-discovered after being lost for decades in an unopened box in a museum . Fossils, including a number of teeth, were found in caves in Zhoukoudian near Beijing in the 1920s, but most of the pieces were lost in the chaos of World War Two. The tooth surfaced in 2011 in a box that had never been unpacked or studied since it was shipped from China in the 1920s. The tooth indicates that Peking Man (a bust is pictured) gnawed on bones and ate nuts . Two Chinese palaeontologists, Liu Wu and Tong Haowen from the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing have now examined the tooth and it has at last been described in the journal Acta Anthropologica Sinica. They quickly determined that it was a canine tooth from a Peking Man. ‘It is a spectacular find,’ said Per Ahlberg, who was one of the team who came across it in the box. ‘We can see numerous details that tell us about this individual’s life. ‘The crown of the tooth is relatively small, which indicates that it belonged to a woman. ‘The tooth is quite worn, so the individual must have been quite old when she died. ‘In addition, two large chips have been knocked out of the enamel, as if hit by something, or perhaps by biting into something really hard such as a bone or a hard nut. ‘At least one of the chips was old when the individual died, since it is partly worn down.’ Dr Ahlberg told MailOnline the woman may have been between 30 and 40 years old when she died, which was a ripe age at the time. Previous studied have shown that the Peking Man used fire to stay warm and wore animal hides. The very first samples of the prehistoric ancestor were found by Otto Zdansky from Uppsala University in the 1920s and are on show alongside a third tooth discovered in the 1950s, at the museum. It became a world sensation in 1927 when crania and other bones were found at the site by Wenhao Weng of the Geological Survey of China and Canadian Davidson Black, who had taken over the excavations. Peking Man, an ancient human ancestor lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago. The name describes the species, not an individual and around 15 partial crania have been found. Examination of a tooth now shows that the species ate nuts and meat with wear and tear indicating he gnawed on bones. In order to survive the harsh weather, Peking Man would have needed to be able to create and manage fire, and now there is solid proof to back this theory in the form of soil samples. It's thought the Peking Man wore animal hides that had been softened using stone tools. Belonging to the species Homo erectus, the Peking Man was also able to make bizarrely drilled holed objects, but it is not understood why. Fossils, including a number of teeth, were found in caves in Zhoukoudian (marked on the map with an 'A') near Beijing in the 1920s, but most of the pieces were lost in the chaos of World War Two . The Peking Man became a world sensation in 1927 when crania (pictured)  and other bones were found at the site by Wenhao Weng of the Geological Survey of China and Canadian Davidson Black . Sadly, the unique collection disappeared during the chaos of the World War Two and has never been found since, but over the last decades, several fossils of Homo erectus have been found in other parts of the world.’ ‘We now know that the species is a direct ancestor to the modern man. ‘However, the lost materials of the Peking Man remain one of palaeontology’s greatest mysteries and most tragic losses’, said Dr Ahlberg. Archaeologists first arrived in Zhoukoudian in 1921 where they were directed to the site by quarrymen. First, human teeth were found at the site but it was Canadian scientist Davidson Black who made some of the most significant discoveries, including a skull, despite his initial findings being treated with scepticism by scientists around the world. Around 200 fossils were gathered until excavation came to an end in 1937 with the Japanese invasion. Sadly, the vast majority of the finds disappeared during the chaos of the World War Two and have never been found since, making the discovery of the tooth especially important . Fossils were placed in the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Peking Union Medical College for safe-keeping, before being packed up for the US in 1941. But the fossils were inexplicably lost as they were being transported through northern China. It is still unknown what happened to the fossils with some believing they sank on Japanese ship the Awa Maru in 1945. US financier Christopher Janus appealed for information on their whereabouts in 1972, promising a reward of $5,000. One woman made contact, demanding $500,000, but nothing ever came of the approach. The Chinese Government also initiated a committee to locate the fossils to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the end of World War Two.The fossils, however, have yet to be located.","Tooth was found in a box at the Museum of Evolution at Uppsala University .

"The father of an 18-month-old girl who was rescued from a wrecked car 14 hours after it plunged into a frigid Utah river has revealed her incredible progress in a video taken from hospital. Lily Groesbeck was released from Primary Children's Hospital on Wednesday, four days after her mother's wrecked car was spotted overturned and partially submerged in a river in Spanish Fork. Lily's mother, 25-year-old Lynn Groesbeck, was killed in the crash but emergency responders found that the little girl was miraculously alive. 'I'm blessed,' Lily's father, 34-year-old Deven Trafny, told KUTV. I'm counting all my blessings right now... She should be gone. She shouldn't be here right now. I'm overwhelmed with joy right now.' Scroll down for video . Safe: Dad Deven Trafny smiles as he looks at his daughter, Lily Groesbeck, in a video taken in hospital and released by the family. Lily has now left the hospital after surviving for 14 hours in a car wreck . On the mend: Trafny is seen playing with his daughter, who is back to her normal self, he has said . He also shared a video of Lily waving shyly at the camera in hospital as he holds her in his arms. He said the toddler has been watching cartoons and laughing with her family members, and remembers everything she knew before the crash. While caring for little Lily, Trafny is trying to comprehend losing the 'love of my life', his fiancée Lynn. 'That's kind of a hard situation for me right now,' he said. 'I haven't really wrapped my head around that. She was the love of my life and I'm going to miss her a lot. I still have to deal with that.' A fisherman spotted the car on Saturday, the day after it hit a cement barrier on a bridge and careened into the river in Spanish Fork, about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City. According to the Deseret News, the angler called a non-emergency line and said: 'Are you guys aware there's a car in the river on the south end of Spanish Fork, Main Street, over the bridge? I didn't see anybody when I came in here and I can't see in the car.' Emotional: He said he is overjoyed and shocked that Lily survived the crash but that he is mourning 'the love of my life' - Lily's mother, Lynn Groesbeck, who was found dead in the wreckage . Then four minutes later, the same caller dialed 911 directly and said: 'There's a car in the river. It's upside down off of Main Street and there is a person inside. I can see a hand.' Rescuers found the unconscious baby girl strapped into her car seat, where she had been hanging upside down for 14 hours as icy water flowed through the car. In a bizarre twist, emergency responders said they had heard desperate pleas from the mother inside the car, even though she had likely been killed on impact. They reported hearing cries of: 'Help me! Help me!' Rescuers have said they are trying to figure out how they had heard the mother's voice. Family: The couple pose for a picture with their baby daughter, who has now left the hospital with just bruises . Mystery: Emergency responders said they arrived on the scene and heard Lynn calling out for help - but later realized she had died on impact. They said they are trying to fathom how they heard her voice . Officer Tyler Beddoes said: 'For two nights I've laid awake trying to figure out exactly what it could be. All I know is it was there, we all heard it. It was extra motivation.' Beddoes said he and officers formed a line in the river and handed the cold girl to one another until she was on the shoreline and in emergency workers' arms. They rushed her to an ambulance and performed CPR. It is still unclear how she managed to survive with no food or water, but a doctor told CNN that when someone suffers from hypothermia, their metabolism slows and their oxygen intake reduces, becoming 'neuro-protective'. Jill Sanderson, Lynn's sister, said her sister was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life . When Lily was retreived from the car, police officers handed the cold girl to one another until she reached the shore and emergency workers could rush her to the hospital . Police were investigating what caused the crash but say Lynn Groesbeck could have been distracted or drowsy. Spanish Fork police Lieutenant Matt Johnson told KUTV that investigators found a bag of what looks marijuana in the car, along with a bottle of 16 pills they think are pain medications and an opened syringe. He said they won't know if drugs contributed to the crash until toxicology reports came back in several weeks.","Lily Groesbeck was found alive on Saturday, 14 hours after her mother's car plunged into a frigid river in Spanish Fork, Utah .

"NYPD Sgt. Frank Marra (above) reported seeing a ghostly lady at the Staten Island landfill, his book reveals . A retired NYPD cop who sifted through ten tons of debris from the September 11th attacks, reported seeing a ghostly lady at the Staten Island landfill, a new book reveals. However, Sgt. Frank Marra, 48, was not the only one who saw the specter, who a psychic medium has explained could have been a spirit, 'soul collector', guiding people to the afterlife, according to the New York Post. In his book, From Landfill to Hallowed Ground, Marra details his experience searching through rubble and remains of the World Trade Center attacks from September 2001 to February 2002 at Fresh Kills landfill. While there, volunteers found 54,000 personal objects and helped identify 1,200 people who perished. The 17-year veteran cop shares about the spirit he and other volunteers saw at the Staten Island landfill, also known as 'The Hill'. This is where the African-American woman was spotted, dressed in white like a Red Cross worker during the Second World War,  carrying a tray of sandwiches. Sgt.

He only saw her a few times and in the distance, more than 50 yards away each time, but he recalls that it clearly looked like a person. And while they were rare sightings, he stashed them away as memories, until about a year later when he spoke to a retired crime-scene detective who mentioned the ghost. The detective asked him if he ever heard stories about the 'old Red Cross worker trying to serve sandwiches and coffees out by the sifters', which brought Marra's memories of her rushing back to mind. 'It hit me like a ton of bricks - I had put that dormant,' said Marra. 'It just reminded me that I remembered seeing her.' While his sightings of the ghost were rare, he stashed them away as memories, until about a year later when he spoke to a retired crime-scene detective who mentioned the ghost (above damaged fire truck and debris from the World Trade Center attacks at the Fresh Kills landfill in 2002) Along with the Red Cross worker, other cops and volunteers witnessed seeing other things while in the landfill from shadows to large black masses (above NYPD officers who worked at Fresh Kills landfill bow their heads in front of a pile of debris on July 15, 2002 during the closing ceremony for the Staten Island landfill) The retired cop who now resides in New Jersey with his wife and three sons also notes how the landfill, with all of its memories from September 11, quickly became a holy ground (left debris and damaged fire trucks at the Staten Island landfill in 2002; right, Marra's book, From Landfill to Hallowed Ground) Along with the Red Cross worker, other cops and volunteers witnessed seeing other things while in the landfill from shadows to large black masses, according to Marra.

"Arrest: Lindsey Ann Radomski, 32, allegedly let seven juveniles fondle her breasts at a party . A yoga teacher with new breast implants flashed them at guests at a bar mitzvah and let underage boys fondle them before performing a sex act on a 15-year-old boy, police have said. Lindsey Ann Radomski, 32, told police in Scottsdale, Arizona that she was too drunk to remember what happened at the party on Saturday night. She was among 80 to 100 guests at the party when she allegedly exposed her new breasts to five adults and they told her to 'sleep it off', Sergeant Ben Hoster told The Arizona Republic. She then went to a pool area, where she flashed juveniles, police said. In the early hours of Sunday morning, while most of the guests were asleep or had gone home, she allegedly invited seven boys, aged 11 to 15, into a bedroom and let them fondle her breasts. When all of the children apart from a 15-year-old boy had left, she performed a sex act on him, the teenager told police. The victim's parents learned of the encounter and went to the police, Hoster said. Radomski, who teaches yoga in the Scottsdale area, was interviewed on Tuesday. She told authorities that she had been too drunk to remember the incident but did admit to flashing. But she arrested and booked on multiple sexual abuse, sexual conduct with a minor and indecent exposure charges. Bond was set at $10,000 at Radomski's initial court appearance on Wednesday.","Lindsey Ann Radomski 'flashed her new breasts at adults and children at a bar mitzvah in Scottsdale, Arizona on Saturday night'

"Theresa May is seen as a more likely Tory leader than Boris Johnson by the party’s future MPs, a poll has found. The Home Secretary regularly appears at the top of polls of party members of their favourite politician. But Mrs May is also better liked than the London Mayor among those candidates on a ‘Future MPs Panel’, according to the survey conducted by Populus. Leading the charge: Theresa May (left) is a more likely Tory leader than Boris Johnson (right) a poll of future MPs has found . It found one in four of those questioned thought she would be the next party leader – whether there is a leadership election later this year in the wake of a Tory election defeat or in six years. Some 26 per cent of those asked backed Mrs May, compared to 22 per cent for Mr Johnson, and 12 per cent for Sajid Javid, rising star of the Tory Right, who is Culture Secretary. The poll will disappoint those Tories who want Chancellor George Osborne to succeed Mr Cameron, who did not register as a potential future leader. Mrs May is seen by allies as Britain’s Angela Merkel and is the longest serving home secretary in more than 50 years. She will challenge Mr Johnson – whom she is thought to regard as a ‘faintly ridiculous figure’ – if the Tories lose the election and Mr Cameron stands down. Mr Johnson is expected to return to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge, having been selected as the party’s candidate for the election, while continuing in his role as mayor. Future Labour MPs told Populus that Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, was favourite to be the party’s next leader. One in four picked the Merseyside MP and former arch Blairite whose politics have become notably more left wing in recent years. Close behind him was Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna on 22 per cent and Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, on 21 per cent. Populus interviewed 147 MPs and prospective parliamentary candidates between January 20 and February 13, all of whom are expected to win their seats.","May often top of the polls as favourite politician by party member .

"Killed: Ross Simons, 34, and his wife Clare, 30, (pictured) died in January 2013 when their tandem bicycle was struck by driver Nicholas Lovell . A move to introduce life sentences for killer drivers has been welcomed by families of victims. The new measure is one of several changes being drawn up by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling in a bid to toughen up the criminal justice system. The maximum sentence for motorists is currently 14 years and the plan to increase this limit is being welcomed by relatives of a couple run down in Bristol by a speeding driver who was already banned from the roads. Ross Simons, 34, and his wife Clare, 30, died in January 2013 when their tandem bicycle was struck by Nicholas Lovell, who had 69 driving convictions and was fleeing police at the time. Heroin addict Lovell, 38, left the couple dying by the side of the road and while awaiting sentencing bragged to other inmates that he would get away 'with four years'. He was eventually sentenced to ten and a half years for each death but was ordered to serve the punishments concurrently, meaning he would effectively only serve one sentence for both deaths. Since his trial, the Simons's families have been campaigning for tougher sentences for dangerous drivers. Speaking to The Express, Mr Simons's sister Kelly Woodruff, 33, said: 'Finally as a family we will be able to rest and be a bit more at peace when they make this change to the law. 'The purpose of our campaign has always been to try to ensure no other family has to go through what we have suffered. 'I hope this will not only help save lives by acting as a deterrent but when the worst does happen it will at least give families a sense that justice has been done, something we have never felt.' Call for tougher laws: Heroin addict Lovell, 38, left the couple dying by the side of the road and while awaiting sentencing bragged to other inmates that he would get away 'with four years' The Simons, described by friends as lovely and caring, were said to be trying for a baby and had 'everything to live for'. In the run up to the collision a police officer in a patrol car recognised Lovell behind the wheel and knew he was banned. Lovell failed to stop when the officer switched on his blue light, disappearing from view, before ploughing into the Simons as they rode their tandem bike. Last week Justice Secretary Chris Grayling visited the site where the couple were killed, along with the MP for Kingswood Bristol, Chris Skidmore, who has long backed the campaign. Reviewing law: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wants to toughen up the criminal justice system . Speaking to the Bristol Post, Mr Grayling said: 'I don't like the idea of people like this coming out half way through the sentence. 'It is shocking to walk here in a normal suburban street and see what can happen. I can only imagine the trauma and turmoil the family must have been through.' Mr Skidmore added: 'We have fought the campaign to get laws changed, which could already prevent future deaths but we want to go further.' The plan to increase the maximum penalty from 14 years is one of several new measures being considered by Mr Grayling to toughen up the criminal justice system. Drivers who flee the scene of an accident without stopping and motorists using their phones at the wheel will also be targeted with harsher punishments. Mr Grayling claims both he and the Prime Minister have agreed to review the upper sentencing limit for causing death by dangerous driving. The Justice Secretary says those caught using mobile phones behind the wheel have 'no excuse' with the hands-free sets available to drivers today. Mr Grayling is also looking to introduce new offences to deal with jihadists attempting to return to the UK and says there are also plans for stricter controls on internet trolls.","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wants to toughen criminal justice system .

"A fraudster paid for his sandwich using a 100 Euro note from the Early Learning Centre. The fake note, which had the logo of the famous children's shop emblazoned cross its front, was handed over by the customer at a fast food shop in Newry, County Down. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said officers were asked to investigate the counterfeit currency after the owner, who initially thought the note was real,  was left out of pocket.

"Flag-waving supporters of the United States flooded the streets of Prague today to cheer on a highly visible display of U.S. military might rolling through Europe. Dozens of Stars and Stripes flags, as well as symbols of the Nato military alliance, thronged the capital of the Czech Republic as American soldiers were given a warm welcome by the locals. Armored carriers, including Stryker multi-purpose fighting vehicles, rolled down the highways before coming to a temporary stop in the city's historic streets as part of an overt show of strength to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Scroll down for video . Armored column: Row on row of American firepower rolled through Prague today as Stars and Stripes filled the air . Warm welcome: Locals turned out in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, and waved the Stars and Stripes and the blue flag of Nato as a welcome to visiting U.S. troops . Show of strength: A huge column of armored might has been working its way through Eastern Europe and the Baltic States in the past week as a show of strength in the region . Route: The U.S. armored column began in three different locations before converging in Prague. It will finish in Germany . Are you watching, Vlad? The U.S. Army's Stryker armored assault vehicles, above, were supported by Air Force fighter jets and Army attack choppers for parts of the route . The armored column is headed to an army base in Vilseck, Germany, in a journey spanning more than 1,000 miles. The troops are travelling through Nato member states, including the Czech Republic, in the wake of fears over Russian military intervention in the region. They were given similarly enthusiastic receptions in other European cities. States in the Baltic feel at particular risk as they share a border with Russia. The convoy, part of a mission dubbed Atlantic Resolve, is designed to reassure members and demonstrate that Nato is prepared to defend its member states. Ukraine, which had its Crimea territory annexed by Russia last year, and claims military intervention is ongoing, applied to join Nato in 2008, but the process was never completed. Under the rules of the alliance, any attack on a member state is regarded as an attack on all of them, a tenet credited with checking Soviet expansion during the Cold War. Happy to see them: Czech locals were pleased to see an American military presence as fears continue over Russia's military action in the region . Bringing the sunshine: The overt military operation is designed to reassure Eastern Europe that the U.S. is ready to act . Shaking hands: A Czech man approached an Army reconnaissance vehicle to greet a soldier in person .

The Dragoon Ride convoy began in three separate branches; one in Talinn, Estonia, one in Vilnius, Linthuania and one in Drawsko Pomorskie, Poland. They converged in Prague and will continue along a single route to Germany, where the U.S. Army has a base. The convoy has in parts received air support from U.S. Air Force jet planes and Army attack helicopters. Supporters of Russia had threatened to disrupt - or even halt - the convoy, but local reports say that agitators were far outnumbered by supporters and that no untoward incidents took place. An army spokesman said: 'Dragoon Ride is a complex mission involving a significant amount of international diplomatic and military cooperation. 'It will allow all units involved an opportunity to exercise key command and control systems across all levels of command, test their unit leadership and maintenance capabilities, while simultaneously providing a highly-visible demonstration of U.S. commitment to its NATO allies and demonstrating NATO’s ability to move military forces freely across allied borders in close cooperation.'

"Lynne Hughes, 33, suffers the rare sleep disorders narcolepsy and cataplexy. She falls asleep suddenly up to six times a day often collapses in the street . Waking from her sleep-walking state, Lynne Hughes was horrified to discover she had punched her husband in the face, breaking his nose. But the mother-of-two's outburst was not intentional or malicious. The 33-year-old is a diagnosed narcoleptic, and falls asleep without warning up to six times a day. She has woken to find she has sprayed Mr Muscle cleaning products on vegetables while cooking dinner and has come round to find she's made herself a sandwich. But for Mrs Hughes, who also suffers the related sleep disorder cataplexy, her illness has a serious side. Cataplexy causes a sufferer's muscles to completely relax, rendering a person unable to move, while remaining fully conscious. And twice while lying paralysed and helpless in a cataleptic state the street, she has been targeted by heartless thieves. Although she couldn't move, the 33-year-old felt hands raiding her pockets, removing her bank cards and mobile phone, while they pretended to help her. The conditions leave her prone to acting out her dreams as she sleep walks around the family's home in Mold, Flintshire. The bath has been removed, to prevent Mrs Hughes falling asleep in it, and she has stopped using a kettle. She said her 'life-changing' sleep episodes are often triggered by laughing or crying. She no longer goes out alone and never carries more than a few pounds in cash in her bag. She said: 'It's changed my life completely. 'On a couple of occasions I've been robbed. Remember, I can't move but I am still aware so I can feel their hands going into my pockets. 'It happened in Chester in about 2008 and then in Connah's Quay three years ago. 'It was people pretending to help me but really they took my bank cards and phone out of my pockets. 'I knew what was happening but couldn't do anything as the more stressed I got the worse the cataplexy got. 'I do not go out alone now.' Narcolepsy, which affects about 30,000 people in the UK, can cause excessive sleepiness and affects the brain's ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. Cataplexy is a co-existing condition which brings on episodes of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger and surprise. In Mrs Hughes' case it causes her to regularly collapse, often after she has been laughing or crying. 'I've had to have my bath taken out because I wasn't safe to use it. I can't use a kettle either,' she said. 'My husband makes me a drink and puts it in the thermos flask.' Mrs Hughes has had many bad experiences in public when she collapses in uncomfortable or unfortunate places. She said: 'People will step over me if I fall down in Tesco. The mother-of-two, has woken from an episode to find she has punched her husband Richard, pictured, in the face, breaking his nose. And the 33-year-old has also sprayed Mr Muscle cleaner on vegetables while cooking dinner for her family. She said: 'It can be quite dangerous' Narcolepsy is a condition that affects around 0.05 per cent of a population. In the UK that equates to around 31,000 sufferers. It is a rare sleep disorder, which affects the brain's ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. It can cause symptoms including a disturbed night's sleep as well as excessive tiredness during the day. Normal sleep falls into a regular pattern of REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM stages. Every 90 minutes or so, a normal sleeper experiences several minutes of REM sleep, where dreaming occurs. They then switch back to non-REM sleep. But, for narcoleptics, their sleep pattern is much more fragmented. This causes them to wake up regularly. In addition, REM sleep can come on very quickly during the day and night, producing dream-like hallucinations. Cataplexy is an episode of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger and surprise. The loss of muscle tone ranges from a just-perceptible weakening of the facial muscles through weakness at the knees, to total collapse on the floor. Speech is slurred, eyesight impaired (double vision, inability to focus) but hearing and awareness remain undisturbed. Attacks often last less than two minutes, and they may only last a few seconds. Some people have repeated attacks of cataplexy which persist for up to 30 minutes. During both mild and severe attacks, the person stays fully conscious. Cataplexy may be most severe when the subject is tired rather than fully alert and can lead to considerable anxiety although anxiety itself is not a trigger. It is thought that about 75 per cent of patients with narcolepsy have cataplexy. Source: Narcolepsy UK . 'The narcolepsy makes me do other strange things as well. I'll fall into automatic behaviour. 'My brain will cycle in and out of a sleep state and my body will carry on going, so I'll wake up to find I've made a sandwich. 'I have no fine motor skills though so I'll have put about a pound of butter and a whole chunk of cheese on a slice of bread. 'It can be quite dangerous too - I once sprayed our vegetables for dinner with Mr Muscle instead of Frylight oil, but my husband noticed in time.' The 33-year-old was formally diagnosed in 2009, but suspects her condition dates back longer than that. 'When I was a teenager I'd start sleeping between lessons and my friends would wake me up on a rota,' she said. 'I just thought I was tired but looking back I realise that was part of it. 'I'm basically the text-book worst-case scenario. I had to do away with the bath because I'd sink down and I could feel myself start to drown but I couldn't do anything about it. 'My husband used to have to be in the bathroom to keep an eye on me.' Mrs Hughes hopes her story will help raise awareness of the conditions she lives with. 'You either curl up and feel sorry for yourself or get on with it,' she added. 'My cataplexic episodes are triggered by strong emotion. 'I can have a fall if I start crying or fall if I laugh. There's no warning. My little boy calls it a 'splat'. 'During milder episodes my speech will slur. 'When I had my little boy in January 2007, during the pregnancy I fell down a lot. 'I lived in a maisonette with two sets of stairs and every check up I'd come in with a bruised hand, a bruised head or another bump.' After visiting a number of different specialists and doctors, some of whom mistook her condition for fatigue and depression, Mrs Hughes finally recognised her condition as being narcolepsy when she was watching a documentary. She said: 'I just thought, ""that's me."" 'I went to my GP and was referred to a sleep centre in Aintree. I was diagnosed within a few months.'","Lynne Hughes has been diagnosed with narcolepsy and cataplexy .

"Three missing British schoolgirls who fled to Syria to join Islamic State were last night believed to be in a house in the city of Raqqa. Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase went missing two weeks ago after boarding a flight from Gatwick to Istanbul. The girls are believed to have crossed from Turkey to Syria through the town of Arai. Yesterday Sky News reporter Stuart Ramsay said: ‘We are told by very good sources in Raqqa that they are there and that they are under the control of Islamic State.’ Missing: The three British schoolgirls, Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase, are believed to be in a house in the city of Raqqa after going missing two weeks ago . He also revealed that they were staying with a British girl – thought to be a pupil from their school who went missing in December and is believed to have joined IS. The 15-year-old student, the first to disappear from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, has not been identified by the authorities. Over the weekend it also emerged that letters from Scotland Yard to the girls’ families – explaining that the pupils would be part of the inquiry into their friend’s disappearance – had been given to the schoolgirls rather than their parents. Fled London: Amira Abase, 15, is among the trio believed to have flown from Gatwick to Istanbul . Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted that ‘with the benefit of hindsight’ officers should have communicated directly with the families. But he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology. However Abase Hussein, the father of Amira, said his daughter would still be at home if he had seen the warning. ‘If we knew, this wouldn’t have happened,’ he said, adding: ‘We would have discussed it and taken away their passports.’ And Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza, said: ‘We wouldn’t have been here today if we’d got that letter and known what was going on.’ At least 22 young women are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months. Scotland Yard has said the investigation into all the missing girls continues. Sir Bernard yesterday warned that girls lured to Syria by IS faced sex abuse at the hands of ‘deeply misogynistic’ militants. He said British jihadi brides were oblivious to the reality of life under the terror group and will be powerless to escape once they arrive.","Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, fled to Syria .

"Little Amie Rose suffers from a rare blood disease - and as a result, has already undergone 60 blood transfusions at the age of just five. The youngster has Diamond Blackfan Anaemia and to treat the condition, she has to go into hospital every four weeks for a blood transfusion. The disorder, which means her body cannot produce red blood cells, is so rare it affects only around 125 people in the country. Amie Rose (pictured right receiving one of her regular blood transfusions in September 2013) has Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, which means her body cannot produce red blood cells . When she was born, Amie had a slight heart murmur, but doctors told her mother Jo, from Horley, Surrey, that it should go away in six weeks. Mrs Rose, 44, said: 'When I took Amie back for her check-up they said she looked a bit pale and they decided to take her in for a blood test. 'The results came back and the doctors said she had to have an emergency blood transfusion as there were not enough red blood cells in her body. 'We were then transferred to Great Ormond's Street hospital to have a bone marrow biopsy and told that Amie would have to have regular blood transfusions.' Amie (pictured with mother Jo and father Gordon) has to go into hospital every four weeks for a transfusion . Amie (pictured at seven weeks) was given an emergency transfusion after doctors decided to take a blood test during a check-up because she looked pale. She then had a bone marrow biopsy . But just a couple of days after being sent home, Amie stopped breathing and her parents took her back to hospital. Doctors were able to stabilise Amie's iron levels but she had to have an emergency operation to insert a port running from her jugular vein into her heart. 'Amie stopped breathing and we had to rush her back into hospital where they starved her and put back on a milk formula,' her mother added. 'We were so scared of what might happen to her but we just wanted Amie to survive.' Every week Amie has to get a nurse to attach a tube with a pump at the bottom to remove the excess iron from her blood. The pump stays attached to the port six days a week.. These pictures show the effects of steroid treatment to treat the rare blood disorder on Amie in October 2011 . Amie's father Gordon, 53, said: 'The port restricts Amie from doing any contact sport and we have to be careful when we pick her up as we could knock the needle in her port. 'The pump is essential for Amie as too much iron in the blood can be fatal and can cause major organ failures. 'Just before her fourth birthday, Amie's port blocked and we were rushed into hospital otherwise it could cause pressure on the jugular. 'Surgeons had to remove the port from her left hand side and insert it on the opposite side. 'We have to make sure that the port is always clean which can be difficult as Amie has a low immune system and she contracted tonsillitis seven times in less than a year. 'She now has a course on antibiotics every two weeks that helps her fight off any illnesses.' Amie's parents are hoping her body will start to regulate the iron in her body so that she only has to wear the pump at night time. Her parents are hopeful that Amie will become eligible for a bone marrow transplant soon, which would 'fix' her, meaning she would not need to continue with the current treatment method . Her father, a building services engineer, said they are hoping Amie will only have to have the pump attached at night time by the end of the year. 'After that we would be hoping that her iron levels stay at a reasonable rate and then she would be eligible for a bone marrow transplant. 'This procedure would 'fix' Amie and she wouldn't need to have all of this current treatment. 'It is an exciting but nerve racking experience - as there are so few people in the UK who has this illness doctors cannot predict what Amie's body will do. 'It would be nice for Amie to have the bone marrow transplant especially now she is getting older and she is starting to get remarks from other children at school.' He aaded: 'It is now all a waiting process to see how Amie's body will react in the next couple of years. 'You hear good stories and bad stories but we are just keeping our fingers crossed that Amie stays our brave, happy little girl.' Red blood cells (pictured) are vital because they circulate oxygen around the body . Diamond Blackfan Anaemia (DBA) is a rare blood disease where the bone marrow fails to produce red blood cells. Red blood cells are necessary for life because they circulate oxygen around the body. Patients are usually diagnosed before the age of two and require treatment to compensate for their lack of red cell production. DBA can cause fatigue, poor growth, lack of appetite and a pale complexion. In about a half of cases patients also suffer associated congenital abnormalities. Some affected children are short for their age and may have delayed puberty. DBA patients also have a slightly elevated risk of certain types of cancer. Many DBA patients are treated with blood transfusions, often monthly, to bring their red blood cell count up to an acceptable level. But frequent transfusions cause an accumulation of iron in the body. Because an overload of iron can cause damage to major organs if it is not properly managed, patients must take a 'chelation' drug to remove excess iron from their bodies. This can take the form of a nightly infusion of medication via a needle over a ten hour period and in other cases, an oral drug can be taken daily.

"Ten members and associates of the DeCavalcante organized crime family have been arrested in New Jersey, according to federal prosecutors. They're listed with nicknames like 'Knuckles' and 'Whitey' and they're accused of plotting to commit murder, distribute drugs and promote prostitution around the Newark area. The suspects include reputed captain 71-year-old Charles Stango, of Henderson, Nevada, and 72-year-old Frank Nigro, of Toms River, a reputed consigliere, or adviser. The DeCavalcantes have long been thought to be the real-life inspiration for HBO's The Sopranos (pictured) Paul Colella, 68, of Toms River was also expected to appear. The criminal complaint alleges the DeCavalcante family operates under the direction of New York's Gambino crime family. The DeCavalcantes have long been thought to be the real-life inspiration for HBO's The Sopranos. Prosecutors allege Stango sought and obtained permission from Nigro to kill a family member in New Jersey. Authorities said Stango discussed his plans with an undercover agent, telling him that the man had insulted an acting boss of the family and was 'out of control'. The intended victim 'had to meet death or you gotta maim him or you just gotta put him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life,' Stango allegedly told the agent. Prosecutor said Stango told the agent that the plan was to hire two members of an outlaw biker gang to shoot the rival, NJ.com reported. Prosecutors claim Stango and his son, Anthony, also planned to operate a high-end escort service in the Toms River area. Some suspects are due in federal court on Thursday afternoon in Newark. Stango is due to appear in a Las Vegas courtroom.","Listed with nicknames like 'Knuckles' and 'Whitey', they're accused of plotting murders, distributing drugs and running prostitution .

"The mother of an unarmed teenager shot dead by police in Madison, Wisconsin, says that similar killings throughout the country have become 'an epidemic'. Andrea Irwin said that the two weeks since her son Tony Robinson was killed have been 'every mother's worst nightmare' The biracial 19-year-old was shot dead by white Madison police officer Matt Kenny, a 12-year- veteran, after an altercation around 6.30pm on March 6. Scroll down for video . Andrea Irwin, the mother of Tony Robinson, said that teenager such as her son being shot by police had become an 'epidemic' Robinson, 19, was fatally shot by Madison, Wisconsin police officer Matt Kenny earlier this month following an incident where he was jumping into traffic . 'What was his reason for taking my son's life' Ms Irwin said when asked what she would say to Kenny by CBS News. 'What exactly was it that made him feel like that was his only option, that there was no other option? And for it to be death, and to impose that sentence on my son.' 'I feel like I'm in a dream and I just want to wake up,' she said. Robinson, who had been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, had reportedly taken hallucinogenic mushrooms before he was shot. A friend called 911 for help from police in dealing with him after he began going in and out of traffic and allegedly assaulted someone. Ms Irwin, who did not confirm that her son had taken hallucinogens, said that officers should have been conscious about approaching someone on mind-altering substances and that more than one officer should have been used in the incident. The mother, who said she 'grew up with him' after having the boy young, was told about the shooting by his friend's mother, according to the Guardian. She arrived at the University of Wisconsin medical center but was kept alone after not being allowed to wait with her boyfriend for news of her son's condition. Ms Irwin (right, comforting her 15-year-old son Jordan) said that recent police shootings have been a 'slaughtering of children'. Robinson's uncle Turin Carter said that the young man, with a white mother and black father, was the 'face of America'. Above, Carter and others carry Robinson's casket . He was shot in the head, torso and arm. Ms Irwin, who has three remaining children, eventually learned that her friend had been shot by a police officer from a relative that saw it on the news. She called the experience 'gut-wrenching'. A string of unarmed black men killed by police last summer set off a series of protests after the deaths. Subsequent decisions by grand juries in St Louis and New York not indict the officers involved intensified demonstrations that coalesced under the slogan 'black lives matter'. Ms Irwin said it has been a 'slaughtering of children. And no answers behind it, no retribution'. 'They're not even allowing them to live their lives or start their lives'. Robinson's uncle said that Robinson, who had a white mother and black father, was 'the face of America.' 'I think that our family dynamic shows that this is a universal issue, because we are not a family of just one race. We are a family of many races,' Turin Carter said. Police killings of unarmed black civilians have led to waves of protests against perceived brutality and bias. Above, demonstrations in Madison over the past two weeks have remained peaceful . Wisconsin law now mandates that officer-involved deaths be investigated by agencies outside the police force . The family of Officer Kenny (pictured) released a statement supporting him . Protests in Madison, a college town and state capital where blacks make up 7 per cent of the cities 240,000 people, have been peaceful. The Wisconsin Justice Department’s Division of Criminal Investigation is looking into the incident. A new Wisconsin law mandates that outside agencies must investigate officer-involved shootings. Ms Irwin says she has spoken to Madison Police Chief Mike Koval about the incident and investigation into it. The family of Officer Kenny, 45, released a statement on Thursday saying they were deeply saddened by the 'tragedy'. 'Madison, as a community, can do better for all its citizens.

"Authorities said Sunday that a 37-year-old woman was shot to death in her San Francisco Bay Area apartment last week following a visit to a Sikh temple. Victim Randhir Kaur was a University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Dentistry student. The Albany Police Department said authorities think Kaur was murdered sometime after returning to her 1068 Kains Avenue apartment on March 8. Victim: Radhir Kaur was shot to death in her San Francisco Bay Area apartment last week following a visit to a Sikh temple, according to authorities . Police said Kaur earlier was at Sikh temple Gurdwara Sahib for afternoon prayers and was going to study that night. University officials grew worried about Kaur's well-being on March 9, and reached out to one of her relatives, who discovered Kaur's body that day, police said. Last week, authorities said the dental student's body was found around 4pm. 'Responding officers found Kaur lying on the floor of her apartment and her car, a brown 1999 Toyota, was found parked and locked at her residence,' the Albany Police Department said in the Sunday news release. It continued 'Also on Monday, personal items belonging to Kaur were found inside a trash receptacle in the 5200 block of Panama Street in the city of Richmond. These items appear to have been moved from the crime scene.' Discovery: Elizabeth Duke, pictured, lives in Richmond and found Kaur's purse as well as a bag containing bloody clothes in her trash can on Monday . Scene: The Albany Police Department has said authorities think Kaur was murdered sometime after returning to her 1068 Kains Avenue apartment, seen center, on March 8 . Richmond resident Elizabeth Duke, who found the items March 9, said in an interview with KTVU 'The blood was, you know, frightening.' The items, the television station reported, included Kaur's Coach purse, ID, credit cards, wallet, and an empty Bank of America envelope. No cash was recovered, according to KTVU. 'Right below the purse was a bag full of bloody clothes,' Duke said. KTVU reported that Duke reached out to police in Albany first, but authorities thought it was a property crime and said to contact police in her city of residence. Authorities later went to Duke's house after the discovery of Kaur's body was made, according to the Fox affiliate. The Albany Police Department said in the Sunday news release that there are no suspects and no one has been arrested. On March 11, the UCSF School of Dentistry announced that a candlelight vigil will be held on March 16 from 5pm to 7pm. A statement from the school said 'The UCSF School of Dentistry community has suffered a great loss, with the tragic passing of Randhir Kaur. Randhir was a beloved friend, student and colleague, and she will be deeply missed . KTVU reported that post-spring break, a memorial is planned for Kaur. According to the television station, Kaur's graduation would have occurred in June 2016. Tips can be submitted to Albany Police by dialing 510-525-7300, or Bay Area Crime Stoppers by dialing 1-800-222-8477.","Randhir Kaur, 37, was shot to death in her Albany, California, apartment last week following a visit to a Sikh temple .

"A Liberace-obsessed politics teacher allegedly posed online as a teenage boy and dished out thousand-dollar payments in return for nude photos and selfies. Jon Cruz, who works at the Bronx High School of Science in New York City, is accused of grooming at least four boys through the Kik messaging app and bribing them to send the photos. Cruz, 31, has been charged with luring minors into sexual conduct as well as soliciting and possessing child pornography, and appeared in court Friday. Scroll down for chat logs seized by the FBI . Charges: Jon Cruz, who teaches in the Bronx, allegedly posed online as a teenager and paid large sums of money for nude photos, 'thumbs-up selfies' and pictures of feet from boys as young as 12 . Big fan: Cruz's social media presence shows him dressed repeatedly as Liberace. He is pictured left in full costume, and right inside a classroom . It came after an FBI found chat logs and internet records they say link Cruz to four boys between the age of 12 and 15, according to the New York Post. Social media profiles belonging to the teacher also show Cruz dressing up repeatedly as Liberace, even donning the costume around school. In some posts he referred to himself as 'Cruzerace'. He allegedly posed as a rich 16-year-old using photographs of an old Bronx Science student and started offering hundreds of dollars at a time for photos - and even sent some of the messages from school premises. Two of the boys are said to have sent him naked photographs, while two others allegedly sent suggestive pictures showing the bodies and faces, posed according to his instructions. Chat logs obtained by FBI agents, and linked to Cruz, show him talking repeatedly about feet and asking the boys to play up how much of a 'popular jock' they are. He also asks for 'thumbs-up selfies' on more than one occasion. In exchange, he sent Visa and American Express gift cards worth as much as $1,600, while asking his victims for the names of more boys he could pursue, according to a criminal complaint. Agents investigating Cruz also claim he tried repeatedly to engage in sexual conversations with the boys, some of which are too explicit to reproduce. The complaint said that one victim was a 15-year-old boy from New Mexico. It alleges that after paying him $900 for pictures of his feet and face, he convinced the boy to send him a cache of at least five nude pictures, posed in his bathroom, in exchange for $450. Gift cards: Cruz allegedly handed over gift cards worth thousands of dollars in total to at least four victims. He is pictured above with a waxwork of Liberace . Work: Cruz taught AP United States Government & Politics with Economics at The Bronx High School of Science . Speaking to another 15-year-old in the state he requested 'weird foot pictures' and eventually paid more than $800 for some 40 pictures - though none involved nudity. A third boy, aged 14, who lived in upstate New York, was also allegedly induced to send pictures. The FBI obtained some of their chat logs, which show him being asked repeatedly for pictures. Though the third boy wasn't asked for nude images, he was allegedly asked to recreate overtly sexual situations. Messages published in the criminal complaint show Cruz allegedly asking for 'really cocky shirtless mirror shots'. He was also asked to include 'stuff in your room that shows you're a preppy, popular jock'. Upon searching his East Village apartment, FBI agents say they found another 20 nude pictures of a fourth boy, who they believe to be just 12 or 13 years old. According to the FBI claims, when Cruz was arrested  he admitted he was behind the messages and payments. He is being held in jail on a $1million bond. A schools spokesman said Cruz, who earns more than $60,000 a year, has not been fired, but was removed from the class after his arrest. These messages were obtained by the FBI from a cell phone belonging to one of the victims. Those labelled 'Cruz' below came from an account which the FBI linked to him via internet logs.

Victim: [Sends photo] Sure but I still know why u [sic] need all these pics? Cruz: Can I be honest? That shirt sums up why you get to take my money. You know? Victim: O yah lol . Cruz: Pictures just have a huge impact on me. Seeing your feet and face and muscles and room and awards and stuff reinforce what a big deal you are. Victim: Yah . Cruz: Now that you see I'm real we can be more honest about [redacted] and [redacted] and sex and stuff? I hope! Victim: OK . Cruz: I still have a lot of questions and feel like we have a lot to discuss. ... 'CAN I SEE YOUR FEET AGAIN?' Cruz: Can I see your feet again and would you flex muscles in some if I owes? And can I ask stuff? [Victim sends photos] . Cruz: Soles too. And a pic of your slides please. Calf muscles and arm muscles and chest/stomach/face? What do I have to pay for for lots of pics and chatting now? [Victim sends more photos] . Cruz: Wow. Can you do that in front of a mirror too? You have a six pack. That's crazy. Respect. Victim: Not in front of a mirror right now I'm in bed. Cruz: Can you go to the bathroom and use one? Victim: Sure what do you need a pic of? Cruz: Really cocky shirtless mirror shots. Close ups of muscles. Maybe point it at your crotch with your finger with an 'I'm a big deal' face. Keep taking muscles and feet and face pics. Like take a ton. ... 'I WAS THINKING A SPECIFIC ACT' Cruz: Socks and shoes off, bare feet on the floor, shorts and underwear crumpled on the floor around the jock's ankles. Victim: Sounds like sex to me.

"The spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis may result in 75 million deaths by 2050, experts have declared. It could also cost the global economy a cumulative $16.7 trillion (£15 trillion) - the equivalent of the European Union's annual output. The comments have come from a UK Parliamentary group which focuses on TB. They follow a warning from the World Health Organisation which said last year that multidrug-resistant TB was at 'crisis levels', with about 480,000 new cases in 2013. X-ray of tuberculosis calcification caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis Bacteria . It is a man-made problem caused by regular TB patients given the wrong medicines or doses, or failing to complete their treatment, which is highly toxic and can take up two years. The fight against TB, the world's second deadliest infectious disease after HIV, is also hampered by a lack of an effective vaccine, the APPG TB said. The only TB vaccine, BCG, protects some children from severe forms of TB - including one that affects the brain - but is unreliable in preventing TB in the lung, which is the most common form of the disease. TB, which spreads through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person, killed 1.5 million people worldwide in 2013, according to the WHO. Yesterday it warned that if left untackled, drug-resistant TB superbugs threaten to shrink the world economy by 0.63 percent annually. As a result, governments must do more to improve research and cooperation, the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Global Tuberculosis (APPG TB), said. The problem stems from the fact that bacteria that cause TB can develop resistance to drugs used to cure the disease. Multidrug-resistant TB fails to respond to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful anti-TB drugs, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The World Health Organisation warned last year that multidrug-resistant TB(pictured) was at 'crisis levels', with about 480,000 new cases in 2013 . The UK parliamentary group's cost projections are based on a scenario in which an additional 40 per cent of all TB cases are resistant to first-line drugs, leading to a doubling of the infection rate. 'The rising global burden of multidrug-resistant TB and other drug-resistant infections will come at a human and economic cost which the global community simply cannot afford to ignore', economist Jim O'Neill said in a statement. Mr O'Neill, a former chief at investment bank Goldman Sachs, was appointed last year by British Prime Minister David Cameron to head a review into antimicrobial resistance. The group urged governments to set up a research and development fund, target investments into basic research and increase support for bilateral TB programs. 'We need better tools to deal with this new threat, but since TB primarily affects the poorest and most vulnerable in society, there is little commercial incentive to develop new drugs,' said Nick Herbert, co-chairman of the APPG TB.","Could also cost the global economy a cumulative $16.7 trillion (£15 trillion)

"The number of homes in which no one has a job has fallen by more than 600,000 since 2010. Official figures out yesterday also show a decline in families living wholly off state handouts. Along with a report last week showing record numbers in work, the figures provide fresh evidence that Iain Duncan Smith's reforms are nudging more welfare claimants into jobs. The Work and Pensions Secretary's apparent success was obscured however by the fall-out of David Cameron's decision to quit by 2020 – and the continuing focus on politicians' kitchens. Official figures show 15.9 households have no-one in work, down from almost 19 per cent in 2010 . Mr Duncan Smith's introduction of universal credit and a £500 a week benefit cap have been heavily criticised by the Left and the poverty lobby which claim families have been impoverished. But yesterday's figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate the reforms are helping to switch large numbers of people from a life on welfare handouts to jobs and earnings. The count showed that the number of jobless households with at least one working age adult fell from 3,763,000 in the last three months of 2010 to 3,149,000 at the end of last year. The 16 per cent drop was a result of unemployed people finding jobs and the economically inactive – those previously uninterested in working – moving into the labour market. The number of homes where no one has ever worked, the hard core of benefit-dependent individuals and families, fell from 275,000 in the final months of 2010 to 245,000 in the same period last year. There were 372,000 fewer children in jobless homes than in 2010, and the number of children in families where no one has ever worked, over 302,000 at the end of 2011, was down to 221,000 at the end of last year. Mr Duncan Smith said: 'The primary aim of our welfare reforms has been to support everyone who is able to work into jobs, to give people the skills as well as the opportunities to be part of the economic recovery. And we've seen remarkable success – with an average of 1,000 more people in work for every single day that this Government has been in power. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the figures showed that almost 2million people are now enjoying the 'self-esteem and financial security that a job brings' 'In total, 1.9million more people with the self-esteem and financial security that a job brings. 'These figures reveal that the number of workless households has fallen by over 600,000 under this Government. Most significantly, there are 272,000 fewer households living in social housing without work. 'And the proportion in social housing where someone does now work with a breadwinner and a role model, is the highest since records began.' Mr Duncan Smith added: 'Behind these figures are countless stories of hard work and determination. By sticking to our long-term economic plan our welfare reforms are transforming the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities.' The worklessness count came on top of last week's record employment figures and a zero inflation rate likely to be good news for families at a time when incomes are beginning to rise again in the wake of the recession. A think tank founded by Mr Duncan Smith, the Centre for Social Justice, called yesterday for changes to the way child poverty is measured. It said that narrow financial measures of poverty are meaningless and have no bearing on the realities of children's lives. The poverty line, usually put at 60 per cent of average income, is 'unrealistic, narrow and naïve', it said. Christian Guy, the centre's director, said: 'Despite some outstanding recent progress on job creation and social justice measures, the official child poverty targets don't help the Government to change the lives of the poorest children. 'Poverty is about more than money. For too many families it is about addiction, worklessness, family breakdown, failing schools and debt traps.' Last Wednesday, figures revealed that 73.3 per cent of working-age people are employed – the highest rate since records began in 1971. The jobless total is 1.86million, the lowest level since the summer of 2008. The unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent compared with a European Union average of 9.8 per cent.","Official figures reveal decline in families living wholly off state handouts .

"Despite flying through the air at high-speeds, researchers have discovered that bats avoid mishaps because they have their own set of ‘traffic rules' when hunting for food. Somerset Daubenton’s bats, in particular, chase each other, perform tandem turns and can even slow down without ever hitting each other. And now researchers have found this is down to the way they take part in 'formation flying'. Researchers from Bristol University measured biosonar bat calls to calculate what members of group perceived as they foraged for food. It found the bats interact by swapping between leading and following, and they swap these roles by copying the route a nearby individual was using up to 500 milliseconds earlier . Dr Marc Holderied, of the School of Biological Sciences at Bristol University, studied pairs of Daubenton’s bats foraging low over water for stranded insects at a site near the village of Barrow Gurney, in Somerset. These flying mammals perceive their surroundings by emitting loud and high-pitched biosonar calls and listening for the returning echoes. Because bat biosonar imaging is much sparser in information than vision, Dr Holderied was able to accurately measure the biosonar calls of the interacting bats and then calculate what each of the individuals perceived. The researchers found that the winged mammal uses one simple trick to create their interactive behaviours - they swap who is taking a leading role and who is following. They swap these leader-follower roles and perform chases or co-ordinated manoeuvres by copying the route a nearby individual was using up to 500 milliseconds earlier. The experts studied Daubenton's bats (pictured). They said: 'The bats seem to have adopted a simple trick - once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo [and] copy this individual’s flight direction. The discovery could help improve search and rescue missions and surveillance operations . This almost as fast as the blink of a human eye, which as been measured at between 300 to 400 milliseconds. Dr Holderied said: 'The bats seem to have adopted a simple trick - once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo, copy this individual’s flight direction within four to five of your own wingbeats.' And his team said the discovery could have wider implications - helping improve search and rescue missions and surveillance operations. The study was published in Plos Computation Biology. The robotic wings are made using carbon fibre and, similar to the wing of a bird, each have a wrist joint custom built using a 3D printer . Inspired by the way bats and birds avoid colliding in mid-air, roboticists have created flying drones with 'morphing wings'. The robotic wings are made using carbon fibre and, similar to the wing of a bird, each have a wrist joint custom built using a 3D printer. These joints are hinged in such a way so that as the rest of the wing flaps, the hand can freely fold and unfold over the arm, much like origami folding, without any actuation. In particular the pin joint connects the arm wing and the hand wing. The arm wing attaches to the body of the robot at the shoulder joint, which initiates the flapping. And the complete wing set has a wingspan of 15.7 inches (40cm) with a length, or chord, of three inches (80 mm). In addition to morphing shape to avoid collisions, the mechanism could also allow future flying robots to easily squeeze between obstacles, such as branches of a tree, and fully recover after accidental hard impacts. The morphing technology was built by experts from Stanford University.","Researches studied pairs of Daubenton’s bats in Barrow Gurney, Somerset .

Other photographs showed the politician holding a PlayStation, Meccano set and posing with ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond playing football and Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe falling over. Yesterday, Mr Alexander was harangued by Labour backbenchers and faced accusations that he was abusing his ministerial office as he set out the plan for those ‘left cold’ by Mr Osborne's Budget. Despite confirming that the Budget was agreed by the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Alexander criticised the plans in it to cut government spending to 1964 levels - ‘the era of Cathy Come Home’. Ridicule: Mr Alexander, who is MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, was harangued by Labour backbenchers yesterday and faced accusations that he was abusing his ministerial office . Edited: Another mocked-up photograph showed the politician posing with former SNP leader Alex Salmond playing football (centre) and Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe falling over (right) Prior to Mr Alexander's comments, Speaker John Bercow insisted that such statements ‘have to be ministerial, delivered not in a personal or party capacity but on behalf of the Government’. But as the Treasury Chief Secretary set out his Lib Dem plan that ‘borrows less than Labour’ and ‘cuts less than the Conservatives’, he was met with a volley of heckling from Labour backbenchers. Shouts of ‘this is an abuse of office’ and ‘this is ridiculous’ could be heard as Opposition MPs and others waved the coalition Budget document.

Together: Mr Alexander (centre left) outside 11 Downing Street with Chancellor George Osborne (centre) ahead of the Budget statement on Wednesday . Mr Alexander insisted his statement was ‘entirely legitimate’ because the plans were in a Treasury document, but deviated from the Tories' ‘cuts for cuts' sake’ and Labour's ‘dragging out the pain’. He said: ‘They may not like it but I'm setting out the numbers in the Treasury document published today, which is an entirely legitimate thing to do.’ The Treasury Chief Secretary outlined Lib Dems plans to achieve the £30billion of savings needed to eliminate the structural current deficit through a combination of tax rises, tackling tax avoidance, departmental cuts and welfare savings. Mr Alexander's plans would mean significantly less welfare cuts than under the Tories but also introduce tax rises which the senior coalition partners have not set out.","Treasury Chief Secretary is mocked for yesterday's photo opportunity .

"Nick Clegg has been put on a secret diet to lose weight before the election. Aides took to hiding biscuits from the Lib Dem leader to stop him putting on the pounds before polling day. The undercover calorie counters have had such success that he has been praised for his new svelte figure, although they admit they have no idea what he eats at home. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has been praised in recent days for his slimmer figure, in contrast with his political paunch seen earlier in the Coalition (right) Mr Clegg is not the first politician to seek to get in shape as polling day approaches. But he could be the first who did not even know that the healthy regime had been imposed. He has previously tried to get in shape through exercise, with kickboxing lessons and playing tennis credited with helping with his squeezed middle. But officials in his Whitehall office grew alarmed at his appetite for biscuits during meetings. A source said: ""When you're Deputy Prime Minister you get offered lots of cups of tea. Your access to biscuits is very generous."" So aides imposed a ban on hobnobs, digestives and rich tea biscuits in his office, and claim it has had startling results. In an interview last week, his trimmer figure was remarked upon. London’s Evening Standard noted how Mr Clegg ‘and lets his business suit flap open in the breeze, revealing a youthful figure with no sign of Whitehall sag’. It is understood that Mr Clegg now accepts the biscuit ban during working hours, but it is not clear if he sticks to the rules around the clock. ‘There are no biscuits in the office, but who knows what he is having at home,’ a source added. Biscuits have been banned from the Deputy Prime Minister's office in Whitehall (pictured) to stop Mr Clegg piling on the pounds during meetings . DAVID CAMERON: Has given up bread, as part of his 'great patriotic struggle' with his weight. GEORGE OSBORNE: Shed pounds on the 5:2 diet, where he fasts for two days every week. ERIC PICKLES: Once boasted that his secret to trying to lose weight was ‘no cheese, no chips, no seconds’. NIGEL LAWSON: The former Chancellor, and father of TV cook NIgella, wrote his own weight loss guide - The Nigel Lawson Diet Book - which helped him to shed five stone in a year. LORD FALCONER: List five stone on an unconventional diet of apples and Diet Coke. A year ago Mr Clegg vowed to play tennis against anyone who would give him a game in a bid to get in shape. In 2013 he revealed he had taken up kickboxing at a local gym to ‘get stuff out of my system’. And four years ago he had a rowing machine installed in his office, holding meetings while wearing shorts and T-shirt. A gruelling six-week election campaign gets underway on March 30, when party leaders will be expected to look their best as they criss-cross the country while surviving on a diet of service station sandwiches. David Cameron has often spoken of his battle with his weight while in office. At one point it was claimed the Prime Minister was experimenting with alternatives to standard milk, such as almond milk, which is low in calories and fat. In January he revealed he had given up bread as part of his 'great patriotic struggle' with his weight, which involves cutting out carbs and running every other day. He added wearily: ‘I can’t get away with it because people can judge pretty clearly whether the pounds have come off or gone on.' Chancellor George Osborne has shed several stone after sticking to the 5:2 diet, which means he has to fast twice a week. It has also been the diet of choice for the SNP’s Alex Salmond. Boris Johnson embarked on a New Year diet after tipping the scales at 16stone. ‘I take on an almost unbelievable amount of exercise, but I have a bad habit of eating the children's supper for breakfast,' the London Mayor said.","Staff in Whitehall banned biscuits from the Lib Dem leader's meetings .

El Caminito del Rey, once a legendary climb for thrill-seekers, slices through the Gaitanes Gorge in southern Spain . Daredevils may be disappointed as the reinforced King’s Pathway is now more of a beauty spot than a danger zone . The attraction has become so popular that it does not have any openings until June. Tourists have been quick to obtain the free tickets, with up to 600 people admitted per day. A four-mile network of paths is open six days a week, weather permitting, and it is estimated that it will take the average visitors four to five hours to walk the full route. Before it was restored and security fences were installed, El Caminito del Rey was an extreme climbing spot, attracting daredevil holidaymakers from around the world thanks to its state of disrepair. Situated nearly 330ft above the Gualdalhorce river, the narrow concrete path, supported by steel stanchions at around 45 degrees into the rock face, had wide gaps and rickety hand rails that posed a massive challenge for even experienced climbers. The committee which oversees the walkway says regional and local councils spent £4million (€5.5million) on the restoration project . The attraction in the Spanish province of Malaga has become so popular that it does not have any openings until June . Tourists have been quick to snap up the free tickets, with up to 600 people admitted per day (no more than 50 visitors every 30 minutes) As part of the years-long restoration project the walkway has been fitted with new boardwalks and security fences to keep visitors safe . Its entrances were officially closed after five people plunged to their deaths in 1999 and 2000, but that didn’t stop adrenaline junkies from continuing to risk their lives on the crumbling path. For years locals and tourists bypassed security measures and ignored the threat of a £5,000 fine for trespassing. That was until the Andalusian and Malagan governments launched the ambitious restoration project. Accessible from the towns of Ardales and Alora (El Chorro), the footpath is more than 100 years old and was built for workers at two nearby hydroelectric plants. It is now overseen by a committee comprising representatives of the Malaga, Ardales and Alora councils.

Scroll down for video . Josh Marsden runs Biohazard Trauma & Crime Scene Cleaning and has shared photos from inside hoarders' houses . Here empty goon sacks and boxes are seen littered throughout the rooms of the house . In some photos, evidence of where someone has died in the middle of the filth is obvious. Mr Marsden assesses how dirty a house is on a scale of one to 10. Homes that fall into the rating one category are those lived in by basic hoarders who collect a lot of things, whereas a rating of 10 means there is so much filth in the house that you cannot see the floor, which is often also covered in animal faeces and infestations everywhere. For a three-bedroom, one-bathroom home, cleaning up can cost up to $20,000 if it scores a rating of 10. 'It usually would take three technicians two weeks to clean a home that’s rated a 10,' Mr Marsden told Daily Mail Australia. 'A 10 has animal faeces, bug infestations... [people are] just throwing rubbish everywhere, and food scraps get put in a pile. In extreme circumstances, employees wear Tyvek suits to protect themselves from hazardous dangerous of their jobs . 'I would rather live at the tip than live in some of these houses. At least the tip has fresh air.' One of the signs Mr Marsden sees that indicate a hoarder is gumboots left on the back step. He said people who had extreme tendencies would use the footwear to wade through their out-of-control homes. Mr Marsden said he would service houses with the rating of 10 every fortnight and three to four houses between a one and six every week. He said cleaning up after hoarders was worse than mopping up unattended deaths, where people die of unnatural causes. This was the scene of an unattended death where a body was found lying in the middle of rubbish . Mr Marsden said most unattended deaths involved hoarders because most were ashamed to let people into their homes . Category 1: Organised hoarding but clean living . Category 2: Organised hoarding where regular cleaning should be undertaken more often . Category 3: The hoarding has gotten to a point where it is now taking over living space and rubbish is now a problem inside with ants nests, roaches . Category 4: In desperate need of sorting and cleaning out junk as valuable items are now mixed in with junk and rubbish . Category 5: Floor space half of what it should be with 50 per cent of the hoarding area now rubbish piles with some food scraps and mice infestation . Category 6: On the way to becoming completely out-of-control with dog/cat urine and faeces now mixed in with the rubbish . Category 7: All rubbish and food scraps, with valuable items un-noticible - only a pathway runs through the mess . Category 8: Same as 7 but now the pathway is also rubbish with no visible floor, several rooms used as rubbish bins . Category 9: Sleeping on dirty mattress or couch among the rubbish as rooms and kitchen are not accessible, food scraps thrown everywhere, roaches, bed bugs, all kinds of bugs. Rats/mice and mould with dry-retching smell. Place looks like a rubbish tip inside with two feet of rubbish in living rooms and higher in other rooms, non-working toilet and no running water . Category 10: Floor and building structure is compromised from rotting floor, walls, and too hazardous to be cleaned without a building inspection . But sadly most unattended deaths involved hoarders who were 'embarrassed or ashamed' to let people visit their homes. 'The bodies tend to be on the pile of rubbish. The rubbish is completely covered in goop and bodily fluid and faeces and everything that comes out a body. Cleaners are often met with two feet deep of rubbish along with caked on faecal matter on the floor . Inside the home of rated 8, which means rubbish and food scraps, with valuable items un-noticible and litter-covered footpath . Mr Marsden's clients range from those who have mental health issues to drug addicts and alcoholics . This is when a house reaches a level three on Mr Marsden's ratings system, with grime and dirt caked onto the kitchen bench . Another home with the stove covered in grease and the nearby sink is covered in stubborn filth . 'Floorboards often are rotten underneath because of the filth that grows underneath. 'Cats and dogs that live there p**s and crap everywhere. They usually live on the couch because there's nowhere else for them to go.' Mr Marsden's clients range from those who have mental health issues to drug addicts and alcoholics. Most people would think the filth would be the most difficult to deal with but he insists it's the hoarders who did not want to throw anything out. Mr Marsden said he would service houses with the rating of 10 every fortnight and three to four houses between a one and six every week . One of the signs Mr Marsden sees that indicate a hoarder is gumboots left on the back step . He said people who had extreme tendencies would use the footwear to wade through their out-of-control homes . This shower has an major mould and limescale problem that has remained uncleaned for a long period of time . 'We won't clean the property if the owner is present during the clean,' Mr Marsden said. 'We tell them to buy a box of stickers and go around and sticker everything with a red or green dot if they want to keep. Anything that's not stickered gets thrown out.' Despite the nature of the job, Mr Marsden said there was no shortage of candidates looking to break into the industry. 'We get calls every week from people wanting jobs. Everyone wants to be a crime scene cleaner because they see it on TV shows and think it's a cool job,' he said.","Josh Marsden runs business that does 'trauma and crime scene cleaning'

"Emails have become the norm within the workplace but they are now being banned at some Australian companies  as it is seen to be the cause of stress and misunderstandings among staff. Face-to-face interaction or instant messaging has become the preferred means of communication among these employees in order to de-clutter their inbox and create better working relationships. One director also says his team has been advised against sending emails to each other during out of office hours, including weekends. Some Australian companies are banning emails as directors believe internal emails cause stress and misunderstandings among staff . Nathan Schokker, the director of facilities management service provider Talio, says he implemented this new rule six months ago and has already seen a positive difference in the workplace. The policy was introduced to his 30 staff members in Brisbane after particular instances which caused unnecessary pressure, conflict and disagreements. 'We had a few cases where staff were feeling compelled to respond to emails that were sent on weekends or public holidays,' Mr Schokker told Daily Mail Australia. 'Staff were feeling like their personal time was being stolen from them. 'I also found that it is hard to imply the correct tone in an email so there were often instances where staff were offended by emails sent by other colleagues or felt like they were being unfairly treated. 'It was enough to cause angst among employees which further became a distraction in the workplace.' Face-to-face interaction or instant messaging has become the preferred means of communication among these employees in order to de-clutter their inbox and create better working relationships . For the CEO of website optimisation company Quasion,  he's introduced instant messaging among staff and has left email correspondence for clients only. 'It's about finding the right way to communicate in a simple manner within the workplace,' Matt Braithwaite-Young told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm not anti-email. I believe clients love emails but they have to be relevant. 'However emailing often isn't suitable for internal communication and these kind of emails can clutter our inbox. 'I found that instant messaging was much suitable for the business and also a very casual form of communication.' Mr Braithwaite-Young also introduced this new strategy about eight months ago to his five Sydney staff and 15 others who are based overseas. 'The problem with email is that it is an e-version of a letter so it's unnecessary for internal communication,' he said. 'Also if your inbox is getting too cluttered that's also bad for the business because it'll pile up over important emails from clients and they can often get lost this way.' Mr Braithwaite-Young says emails or even phone calls can be intrusive to staff who are not in the office at the time. 'With instant messaging, people can respond when it's suitable for them when they're back in the office,' he said. 'There's a misconception and expectation that your response to instant messages has to be immediate but that's not how we see it. For us, it's an organising method that works for our great team and working culture.' One company director said he banned internal emails as his staff were increasingly feeling pressued to respond to them, particulary during their time off work . So far, Mr Schokker says the new policy has been successful and is hoping to continue enforcing it at his company. And if an urgent matter arises after office hours, Talio staff are encouraged to phone colleagues 'out of respect for each other'. 'I believe that work shouldn't interfere with your personal time and that way staff will come back to work much happier the next day,' Mr Schokker said. 'We've also empowered employees to be self-governing when they receive internal emails, so they can choose to have a quiet word amongst themselves or not respond at all or respond when they're back in the office. 'Now we've seen about a 90 per cent reduction in emails and I can without a doubt say that it has improved our workplace.'","Companies believe internal emails cause stress and misunderstandings .

"Labour's flagship economic plan to increase taxes on big business to ease the pressure on the high street could cost 100,000 jobs, David Cameron claimed today. The Prime Minister said the proposal to hike corporation tax for the first time in 40 years was 'crazy'. Corporation tax is set to fall from 21p to 20p tomorrow – but Labour have pledged to reverse the cut to help reduce business rates for millions of smaller firms. Corporation tax is set to fall from 21p to 20p tomorrow – but in a speech today in Swindon Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls pledged to reverse the cut to help reduce business rates for millions of smaller firms . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he would use the first budget of a Labour government to cut business rates for 1.5 million small companies - worth an average of £400 to each firm – and then freeze them the following year. Speaking in Swindon on the first full day of the election campaign this morning, Mr Balls said 17 small firms would benefit from the cut for every one large business helped by the Coalition's reduction in corporation tax. He said: 'It's not right to go ahead with the further cut for larger companies when we can use the money in a better way to help us create more good jobs by backing small companies.' Mr Balls said he would use the first budget of a Labour government to cut business rates for 1.5 million small companies - worth an average of £400 to each firm – and then freeze them the following year . Mr Balls said the coalition spent £7 billion over the last five years cutting the main rate of corporation tax to the benefit of larger firms while revenues from business rates rose by £3 billion, at an average cost to firms of £1,500-a-year. Will Straw, the son of former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, was out campaigning in Blackburn today. He is standing for Parliament in the Rossendale and Darwen constituency . Mr Balls added: 'Unleashing the potential of smaller businesses to grow, create more good jobs and raise living standards is a vital part of Labour's better plan. 'This is part of our plan to deliver a simpler and fairer tax system for small businesses. This is the right priority when money is tight. And it will mean that the tax burden on small businesses will be lower with Labour than under the Tories.' However the move risks re-opening the rift with some big business leaders who have strongly criticised Labour's spending plans. It comes after some company bosses complained at the way comments they had made expressing concern about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU were included in a Labour advertisement attacking the Conservatives. Mr Cameron – who this morning set out the Conservative pledge to boost employment by two million over the next five years – told Sky News's Sunrise that Labour's plan to raise corporation tax was 'a crazy thing to do when the economy is growing'. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke said that abandoning the cut in corporation tax would jeopardise economic security. He said: 'This would be the first time corporation tax has risen in over 40 years and Labour's plans could cost 96,400 jobs - it would put people's economic security at risk. 'The Conservative Party is helping businesses small and large as part of our long-term economic plan - we don't divide them up for the sake of making a political point.'","Ed Balls unveiled proposal to cut business rates for millions of small firms .

"A playboy drug baron who stashed an arsenal of guns and ammunition in a young mother's Honda Civic in exchange for letting her friend drive his Maserati has been jailed for 27 years. Babs Arogundade, 28, who also owned a Bentley, lived a life of luxury and regularly splashed out thousands of pounds on champagne and expensive jewellery including diamond-encrusted Rolex watches. However, his gangster lifestyle came to light when he was caught stashing lethal weapons in the boot of 27-year-old mother Bianca Willoughby's car in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. Babs Arogundade, 28, (left) stashed an arsenal of guns and ammunition in the boot of mother Bianca Willoughby's (right) car in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, in exchange for letting her friend use his Maserati . Police found four shotguns, a loaded Smith and Wesson handgun and a Winchester rifle when they raided the vehicle during a surveillance operation focusing on Arogundade's criminal lifestyle. His crimes were outlined at the Old Bailey on Friday, where he was convicted of conspiracy to supply drugs and possession of firearms. The court heard how Arogundade often frequented expensive West End nightclubs and met Ms Willoughby two nights before he was caught in May 2013. She is said to have agreed to help him with 'a favour' after she went to his home in St John's Wood, north west London, to ask for financial support for her business. The 'favour' was to look after bags filled with the weapons in exchange for him allowing her friend to borrow his expensive Maserati for a wedding. Prosecutor Tom Wilkins told the court about the operation on May 27, 2013, which led to the conviction of the 'charismatic gangster'. He told the Old Bailey: 'Armed officers intercepted a blue Honda Civic parked in Hemel Hempstead and found Willoughby sitting in the driver's seat with her four-year-old son sitting next to her. 'Inside the boot was four shotguns, a hand gun and a rifle together with compatible ammunition.' Arogundade was standing by the boot with a sports bag, the prosecutor said. He added: 'The prosecution say he brought that bag and would have used it to take back whichever firearms he was going to select from Willoughby's car.' The cache included a Smith and Wesson revolver containing one bullet, a Winchester rifle with seven rounds, a sawn off pump-action shotgun and three other shotguns with more than 300 shells. Mr Wilkins said the stash could 'really only be described as an arsenal of guns and ammunition'. Police found four shotguns, a loaded Smith and Wesson handgun (pictured), a Winchester rifle and ammunition when they raided the Honda Civic during a surveillance operation focusing on his criminal ways . A shotgun was among the items seized from Ms Willoughby's car. The Old Bailey heard that he kept the weaponry in her Honda Civic in return for allowing her friend to borrow his expensive Maserati for a wedding . Ammunition was also discovered hidden in bags in the boot of the car, which was occupied by Ms Willoughby and her four-year-old son in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, when police raided it in 2013 . Both Willoughby and Arogundade were arrested at the scene and the young mother told police she had agreed to do the favour following a visit to his home. She claimed he let her stay the night when she asked for financial help, but spent most of the time fending off unwelcome sexual advances. She told the court: 'He said: ""Did your friend enjoy the Maserati?"", he was saying it would be a lot of money to hire'. 'He said: ""I did you a favour, and I would like you to do a favour"".' The court heard a set of keys to the Maserati were later found stashed along with diamond-encrusted jewellery and expensive watches under a sink at an address in Isleworth, west London. Mr Wilkins said it showed Arogundade was 'storing items at premises under the control of women he knew.' Despite the keys being found, it is believed the Maserati was sold on to a private owner before Arogundade was convicted. Ms Willoughby was cleared of 15 offences of possessing guns and ammunition but a jury found Arogundade guilty of the same charges following a trial. He was also found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine along with 34-year-old co-defendant Fred Jones-Lartey, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Another co-defendant, Nicole Douglas, 28, also admitted the same charge after she was caught with a kilogramme of cocaine in her car on May 7, 2013 and was handed a four-year jail term. The court heard how the Class A drug was found wrapped in pink children's wrapping paper after police stopped her Blue Vauxhall Astra in south west London. Mother Bianca Willoughby, 27, (right) from Hertfordshire, was originally arrested at the scene by police but was cleared at the Old Bailey (pictured outside court, left) of 15 offences of possessing guns and ammunition . The package contained 74 per cent pure cocaine, which is said to have a street value of £200,000. Weighing scales, plastic bags containing 1.22kg of crack cocaine and cutting agent were later found at her address in Wembley. Police had earlier seen Arogundade place an item into the back of Douglas' car and his fingerprints and those of Jones-Lartey were also found on the bags. A garage registered to Jones-Lartey was found containing presses to make 1 kilo bars of cocaine as well as an empty 25 kilogramme barrel of a well-known cutting agent. Arogundade was sentenced to 15 years for the drug offence to be served consecutively with an eight-year sentence for possession of a loaded handgun and four years for possession of a loaded rifle, making 27 years in all. Judge Anuja Dhir QC handed Arogundade concurrent jail terms of six years on another firearms charge, two years on a further count and three years respectively for three other charges. She imposed no further sentence on another eight counts. Jailing Arogundade, the judge said: 'The court heard... about your lifestyle, which involved luxury cars, a Bentley and a Maserati, a collection of expensive watches, which were found, a Rolex and equally expensive brands, and a collection of diamond-encrusted jewellery. 'As to the guns. You stored those guns in the car of someone I am satisfied that you took advantage of the fact she had recently broken up with her boyfriend and was more vulnerable than usual. 'I have no doubt you are not just a drug dealer, but somebody with a leading role in an organisation involved in supplying multi-kilos of Class A drugs. Co-defendants Fred Jones-Lartey, 34, (left) and Nicole Douglas, 28, (right) were also jailed at the Old Bailey on Friday for 12 years and four years respectively after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine . Police found a kilogramme of cocaine in a car belonging to Nicole Douglas on May 7, 2013 and later found she had links to Arogundade. Crack cocaine and cutting agents were later found at her address in Wembley . The court heard how cocaine, with a street value of £200,000, was found wrapped in pink children's wrapping paper after police stopped Nicole Douglas as she drove her Blue Vauxhall Astra across south west London . 'You have a charismatic personality and you were able and you did encourage and persuade others to help you in your criminal activities. 'I have no doubt that some of them did so for very little personal gain and without knowing the full extent to which you were including them in serious criminal activities. 'Some of them, formerly of good character, were drawn to you because of your personality, women who regarded you as a friend. You took advantage of that trust.' Following the sentencing, detective inspector Keely Smith, from the Metropolitan Police Service's Projects Team, said: 'This case has prevented six firearms from reaching the streets of London and having potentially lethal outcomes. 'I believe Arogundade was looking to sell the weapons on to those who would be willing to use them. 'This investigation highlights the work my team is doing on a day-to-day basis to keep the community safe.'","Babs Arogundade stored guns and ammunition in Bianca Willoughby's car .

"Five pensioners have been killed in their homes in a stabbing spree in rural Japan allegedly by a neighbour who had tweeted about stalking and telepathy before the killings. The suspect was named by police as Tatsuhiko Hirano, an unemployed man reportedly described as a 'hikikomori' - or social misfit. Police found the bloodied bodies of a man and a woman, both aged around 80, in the main house on the site on the quiet island of Awajishima . Two unconscious women, aged around 60 and 80, were discovered in another building, while a badly wounded man in his 60s was found outside. All three were rushed to hospital and were later confirmed dead, police said. Massacre in rural Japan: Detectives comb the scene in Sumoto city on the Japanese island of Awajishima where five pensioners were stabbed to death by a neighbour who has reportedly confessed to the killings . The alarm was raised by a 32-year-old woman who rang police to say her parents had been stabbed. The 40-year-old suspect is being quizzed by detectives, but the motive was unclear and police have yet to find the weapon used in the attacks. Local media said Hirano's clothes were spattered with blood and that he had admitted to the multiple killing. A Twitter account that appeared to be run by the suspect had been used over the past month. Tweets included one with the address of the homicides and a map of the scene. Other tweets appeared to be about telepathy and stalking. The attacks happened in Sumoto, a small city on an island in western Japan, said deputy police chief Keizo Okumoto. Hirano lives in the area with his father and grandmother, Jiji Press reported. Locals told the agency he rarely leaves his home and has largely been isolated from society since his school days. Map showing Awajishima in Japan where police arrested a man suspected of stabbing five people to death . The phenomenon of so-called 'hikikomori' -- literally 'the withdrawn' -- rears its head fairly frequently in Japan. Often it applies to maladjusted people in their teens or early 20s who shut themselves away for years in their parents' homes, many living in darkened bedrooms with little or no human contact. While many eventually emerge, others continue well into adulthood, protected from the pressures of life by their ageing parents. Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan and even more so in most small towns. Sumoto, a city of 44,000 people on Awaji island, is known for its oranges, onions and Awaji beef. Japanese television stations showed the victims' homes surrounded by agricultural fields. 'Normally, we get one call a day, if that,' Mr Okumoto said. 'And usually it's about a bike theft or someone getting beaten up.'","Bodies of man and woman in their 80s found dead by police in one house .

"Just as I can't travel to Liverpool without thinking of The Beatles, so I can't travel to Los Angeles without thinking of The Beach Boys. Their songs of beaches, baggies, boards and bikinis painted a picture of a sun-kissed paradise, and their voices sounded as bright and as laid-back as California itself. This time I was travelling specifically to discover the people and places that inspired the band. Their songs sounded as bright as a sun-kissed paradise, their voices sounded as laid-back as California itself . I started in Hawthorne where the three Wilson brothers - Brian, Carl and Dennis - were raised, and joined up with guitarist Al Jardine and vocalist Mike Love to form a group. The Wilson family home on 119th Street, where the boys taped their first single Surfin' in 1961, was demolished to make way for Interstate 105. The rest of the street remains though, its neat lawns, porches and fluttering flags reminders of the group's clean-cut All-American origins. A redbrick memorial now stands at the site of the Wilson house, with a bas-relief frieze showing the group carrying a surfboard and a plaque noting that the music conceived here 'broadcast to the world an image of LA as a place of sun, surf and romance'. Hawthorne is indeed a place of sun (263 days a year) but no surf and little romance. It's a charmless city that expanded on the back of the post-war aviation industry (Los Angeles International is only five miles away). I could see why the teenagers of the 1950s would get 'bugged' driving 'up and down the same old strip'. Hawthorne Boulevard, with its low-rise jewellery shops and furniture stores, is no place for the young. The Pizza Show added a splash of colour when it arrived in 1956 and became a home from home for the fledgling Beach Boys. I started in Hawthorne where the three Wilson brothers - Brian, Carl and Dennis - were raised, and joined up with guitarist Al Jardine and vocalist Mike Love to form a group . Now run by the son of the original owner, it retains its kitsch medieval Italian interior, with wrought iron chandeliers, tiled awnings and mock grilled windows. Foster's Freeze, another gathering place, is a blue-roofed fast-food outlet that offers food from one service hatch and ice cream from another. When I arrived Louie Louie, a 1963 hit by The Kingsmen, was playing over speakers in the overhang. This was the very 'hamburger stand' where Brian Wilson saw a girl pull up in her father's Thunderbird and had the inspiration for Fun Fun Fun. Hawthorne High School, around the corner on El Segundo Boulevard, is where the Wilson boys and Jardine attended. The Beach Boys came back to play the 1969 prom and honoured the institution in their song Be True to Your School. The nearest surfing beach to Hawthorne is Manhattan, but the best is Huntington Beach, better known as Surf City USA. Here the sand is soft, the surf is year-round, and the broad beaches stretch for more than eight miles. Other than Dennis Wilson, The Beach Boys were famously non-surfers, but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning ocean-side culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it. They mentioned Huntington Beach in Surfin' Safari. The city of Huntington Beach makes much of its surfers. There's a Walk of Fame, a Hall of Fame and a small International Surfing Museum. The sports shops sell everything from boards and wetsuits to sunglasses, caps and jeans. My hotel, the Waterfront Beach Resort, had a surfboard in the foyer and doorknob signs that read Wiped Out rather than Do Not Disturb. It was cold and overcast on my first morning but by 8.30am there were already more than 100 surfers bobbing about in the ocean. From the pier I could watch them mounting their boards and waiting patiently to ride in on the most powerful of the tall, grey waves. As if on cue, a local surf music tribute band, The Breakaways dressed in faded blue denims and short-sleeved Hawaiian shirts, began playing at the pier entrance. An even better insight into surf culture and music came a few days later when The Surfaris drummer David Raven took me to an outdoor gig in Irvine, Orange County, where he played with bassist Jay Truax (ex-Nomads), and guitarists Ron Eglit (Dick Dale and his Band) and Paul Johnson (The Bel-Airs). They called themselves The Legends Surf Band. We picked up Johnson from his apartment. He was wearing a baseball cap, blue jeans and sandals and had a black patch over his left eye. On the drive down he told me his story. As a 15-year old schoolboy in 1961 he'd composed a hit tune called Mr Moto for The Bel-Airs. That summer, when playing at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Redondo Beach, a leading surfer came over to him and said: 'Wow, man! Your music sounds just like it feels out on a wave. You should call it surf music.' So he did. Other than Dennis Wilson, The Beach Boys were famously non-surfers, but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning ocean-side culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it . When The Beach Boys adopted this sound the hard-core sports crowd initially shunned them. 'As long as they posed as surfers they were resented by those in the true beach culture,' Johnson told me. 'But when they went on to celebrate California youth culture at large by singing about cars and cruising, that broadened their appeal. After that, even surfers appreciated them.' When The Beach Boys started recording their focus shifted from Hawthorne to Hollywood. They signed with Capitol Records, whose 13-storey circular tower at 1750 Vine Street, built in 1956, has become an LA landmark. Legend has it that the architecture was based on the image of a bunch of singles stacked on the spindle of a record player. The night I visited, Arcade Fire were playing a promotional set on a specially built platform outside the tower. The Beach Boys' earliest albums were recorded at Capitol but by the time of Surfer Girl and Little Deuce Coupe, they were also recording around the corner at United and Western (6050 Sunset Boulevard). Now called Ocean Way Studios, this is where they recorded their 2012 comeback album That's Why God Made The Radio. In 1965, Brian Wilson bought the then-modern 1448 Laurel Way in Beverly Hills with its great views over the LA basin. That summer, when playing at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Redondo Beach, a leading surfer came over to him and said: 'Wow, man! Your music sounds just like it feels out on a wave. You should call it surf music' It was here that he notoriously built himself a huge sandbox in the living room to stimulate his creative juices. (The video for Sloop John B was filmed in the garden pool.) Two years later he moved to 10452 Bellagio Road in the more upmarket gated community of Bel Air. Several Beach Boys' albums, including Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, 20/20 and Surf's Up, were partially recorded here, while Charles Manson, a fringe figure on the LA music scene in 1969, visited to tape songs that he'd written. In songs such as Little Deuce Coupe, Shut Down, Little Honda, and Fun Fun Fun, The Beach Boys explored the parallel teenage subculture of cruising and hot-rodding. Illegal street racing still takes place but usually in the early hours of the morning, and it's a crime even to be a spectator. Custom car shows tend to happen out in the desert rather than in the city. But at the Petersen Automotive Museum (6060 Wilshire Boulevard) it's possible to see everything from hot rods and deuce coupes to Thunderbirds and Chevrolets. Spread over two spacious floors, there are plenty of cars from the era The Beach Boys celebrated - a peach-coloured 1957 Lincoln Premiere once owned by Jayne Mansfield, a black 1957 Chrysler, and a wonderful boat-sized 1959 red Cadillac Convertible. The hot rod section has a classic Deuce Coupe customised from a 1932 Ford. Appropriately the museum cafe, Johnny Rockets, is a 50s-style diner with red plastic seating, chrome surfaces and neon signs. On my final day I headed north on the Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu.  There's probably no road that better embraces the joys of LA - steep hills and canyons to one side, broad beaches and ocean to the other . On my final day I headed north on the Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu. There's probably no road that better embraces the geographical joys of LA - steep hills and canyons to one side, broad beaches and ocean to the other - and no drive is better suited to a Beach Boys' soundtrack. The group even recorded a song about it in 2012. Beyond Malibu lies Paradise Cove. A left-hand turn took me a mile down a hill to a private beach edged with cliffs where the group was photographed for the cover of 1962's Surfin' Safari, and again two years later for All Summer Long. Paradise Cove is now home to one of the world's most luxurious trailer parks. Film directors, screenwriters, models and Hollywood actors such as Minnie Driver and Matthew McConaughey have swapped bricks and mortar for transportable homes with a view. A surfboard-shaped sign ironically declared No Surfboards.

"This is the thrilling moment a professional surfer jumped ship as a major wave at a California surfing spot crashed into his boat. Mark Healey, 33, was at Mavericks, a famous big wave surfing spot near Half Moon Bay, when he saw the wave coming toward him and made the split second decision. Healey turned to his friends and said 'I don't know about you guys, but I'm jumping'. Scroll down for video . This is the moment professional surfer Mark Healey, 33, jumped ship as a major wave crashed into his boat at the Mavericks surfing spot in California . When Healey saw the wave coming toward him he  turned to his friends and said 'I don't know about you guys, but I'm jumping'. His friends chose to hold on hard to the railings . 'Typically, in a potential maritime disaster, the best idea is to stay with the boat,' Healey told Fox News. 'But I really didn't feel like getting smashed around like an ice cube in a shaker.' Healey, who is also a free-diver and part-time Hollywood stuntman, sailed over deck and into the sea while his friends held on hard to the railing. After the wave passed, the boat was still standing upright and Healey got picked up by his friends, who he said were 'basically crying laughing at me'. Healey, who is also a free-diver and part-time Hollywood stuntman, said he didn't 'feel like getting smashed around like an ice cube in a shaker' Healey pops back up for air after the wave passes and leaves the boat still standing upright . 'I came up pretty much dying laughing, and then I checked to make sure everybody was okay on the boat,' he said. 'There was some damaged equipment, soaked cameras, but everybody was pretty much in good shape.' Healey posted a video of his incredible jump on his official Facebook page in December, writing 'This was the best wave I got at Mavericks Saturday!' 'That's me flying through the air, trying to put as much space between myself and the potentially doomed boat.' The video only recently went viral after it won the 2015 Wipeout of the Year at the XXL Big Wave Awards last week.

"A father who endured a savage grizzly bear attack in Montana in 2005 and lived to tell the tale is speaking out about his horrific experience 10 years later. 'We are both extremely lucky,' Johan Otter told 10News.com. 'There's no bigger jackpot, basically.' Now fully healed, Otter and his daughter Jenna are the subjects of an episode of ABC's In an Instant, which dramatizes the events as they unfolded on a trail at Glacier National Park. The bear seemed to come out of nowhere, Otter recalled, along with her two cubs. Scroll down for video . Lucky: Johan Otter was savagely mauled by a bear in Montana ten years ago and is now speaking out about the harrowing tale . 'She could have touched it -- basically that close,' Otter says of his daughter. 'So she stepped back real fast and just naturally, as a parent, you step in front of your kid.' 'The worst fear of a parent is to hear your child scream,' a tearful Otter told In an Instant. That's when the mama bear attacked, tearing off nearly 80 percent of Otter's scalp, breaking his neck and gouging his right eye. 'All I see is claws and teeth,' Otter said. 'The bear kind of goes like this on it, basically digging for a bone, which is your skull and biting on it like this.' Despite the massive wounds, Otter says he remained standing and in a in instant decided the only way to survive was to leap off the mountain. His daughter, who also sustained life threatening injuries, eventually did the same and the two ended up on the same mountain ledge. But not before the bear turned its attention to Jenna. Horrific: Otter's neck was broken and one of his eyes gouged by the angry mother bears claw . The bear kind of goes like this on it, basically digging for a bone, which is your skull and biting on it like this,' recalled Otter, who lost most of his scalp in the attack . 'The bear stood over me and it put one paw on either side of my head,' Jenna recalled. 'The bear took my head in its mouth. Its lower jaw was kind of around my jaw. It's upper jaw was around the back of my head. 'When it bit me, I didn't feel pain, just pressure,' she said. Thinking fast, Jenna played dead and the bear wandered off. The immediate danger was gone, but the looming threat of their massive injuries remained. Jenna began to scream for help and soon some passing hikers were able to call for help. Unfortunately, the mother and father could not be pulled from the mountain for another three hours. An arduous recovery followed for Otter, but the Escondido, California man prevailed. According to UTSanDiego.com, he's even managed to run the Boston Marathon six times since the ordeal. The attack occurred on a remote trail, which made the subsequent rescue painfully difficult . After Otter was mauled to the brink of death, the bear went after Jenna. She was left with broken vertebrae and a lacerated skull (grab from ABC's In an Instant) Otter's daughter Jenna has also fully recovered and is now in her fourth year of medical school at prestigious Columbia University. She recalled to ABC what she was thinking during the terrifying ordeal. 'I just thought that we would die, it's too bad that I'm not going to live past 18,' she recalls thinking. Thankfully, and miraculously, Jenna was wrong. She's now working towards becoming an emergency room physician. And while her father still has residual PTSD from the attack, the family continues to hike the same area where he was nearly killed. 'We're already planning what kind of trail we're going to do when we're 80, so we'll see,' Otter told 10 News. 'The worst fear of a parent is to hear your child scream,' a tearful Otter recalled .

"A grandson was today accused of illegally owning a dangerous dog which killed his grandmother in a savage attack in her home. Cardiff Magistrates' Court heard Craig Greve, 23, of Cardiff, was the owner of the American bulldog which was dangerously out of control. Rhona Greve, 64, of Ely, Cardiff, suffered 16 bite wounds to her neck and face after the dog - named Solo - attacked her last Friday evening, the court was told. She later died at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff. Scroll down for video . Mother-of-four Rhona Greve, 64, (pictured) died after she was savaged by a dog in her own home . Mr Greve is charged with both having a dog while being banned for life from doing so, and being the owner of a dangerously out of control dog. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at the magistrates' court hearing today. Members of his family and friends were in the public gallery for the hearing which lasted nearly an hour. The case has been sent to Cardiff crown court and he was remanded in custody. Her heartbroken daughter Clare said: 'I got the call to say: ""Your mum's been savaged by a dog"". 'It all happened so quickly. When I arrived at hospital she was already gone. 'They asked me if I wanted to see her body but I didn't have the heart. I didn't want to see her like that. She added: 'She was a brilliant mum and she didn't deserve to go like that. I can only imagine what Craig is going through right now. He must be devastated. 'We're all waiting to find out more about what has happened. You just never expect something like this.' Officers were called to the home in Ely shortly after 10pm on Friday to reports that a 64-year-old woman had suffered serious injuries . The court heard how grandson Greve lived with his grandmother - and was brought up 'like her own child'. She took him in when his mother Amanda, 40, had a stroke at a 'very young age'. Greve told police how he returned home to find the American bulldog standing above his grandmother in the kitchen. Mrs Greve suffered neck and face injuries after she was mauled by the out-of-control dog . Prosecutor Katy McMahon said: 'As a result of the dog being out of control, it has caused harm to Rhona Greve resulting in her death. 'She sustained significant injuries and died later in hospital.' Police were called by neighbours and the court heard officers said the dog was 'snarling with blood on its teeth.' Miss McMahon said: 'Officers described the dog as going beserk.' His lawyer Trudy McBride said: 'This is an extremely tragic case. He is the grandson of the deceased. He saw what happened and was with her when she passed away.' Rhona had been a full-time carer for her husband Malcolm as he battled lung disease emphysema. After his death more than five years ago Rhona loved the American bulldog keeping her company. A friend said: 'She loved that dog and he kept her company. We can't think what happened to make Solo turn like that.' Another said: 'She was a real lover of people and their pets. She loved having people around and their pets too.' Rhona had four children - three daughters and a son who died at a young age. She also had 21 grandchildren. Flowers and tributes have been laid at the house which has now been taped off by police. Local councillor Susan Goddard said: 'This is a terrible tragedy, it's just too awful to comprehend. It's terrible.' A 17-year-old boy who was also arrested in connection with the incident has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. Supt Andy Valentine of South Wales Police's eastern division said: 'This is tragic incident, which I know will shock and upset the local community. 'The woman's family are understandably extremely distressed and are being supported by specially trained police officers.' Flowers and tributes have been laid at the house in Ely, Cardiff, which has now been taped off by police . Supt Valentine reassured local residents it was an 'isolated incident'. According to NHS data, as of 2014 there have been 4,263 admissions to hospitals in Wales from dog attacks since 1999. In February last year, six-day-old baby Eliza-Mae Mullane from Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire, died from a serious head injury after being attacked by a dog.

"As the days countdown to Saturday’s NSW State Election, politicians are using every way they can to gain votes, and one of these is to advertise on gay hook-up app, Grindr. Labor’s Penny Sharpe, who is looking to become a member of the Legislative Assembly, and Sydney state independent MP Alex Greenwich are both using the app in a bid to get as many votes as possible. The two gay politicians are following up on the example set by Greens candidate Sam Hibbins who won a seat in Prahran in November’s Victorian state election. Labor’s Penny Sharpe (left) and Sydney state independent MP Alex Greenwich (right) are using the Grindr app to reach out to the electorate . Hibbins was one of Australia’s first politicians to use hook-up apps as a method to reach voters successfully. He used the Grindr app to send political messages to members of Melbourne’s Prahran electorate, living in the suburbs of Prahran, Windsor, South Yarra and St Kilda East, as the candidate campaigns ahead of the election. The Star Observer reports that Sharpe was using the app on a trial basis for this election. 'It’s not a space I play in regularly,' said Ms Sharpe, who is standing as Labor’s candidate in the inner west seat of Newtown. Ms Sharpe and Mr Greenwich both placed ads on Grindr to encourage people to vote for them . 'But I’m sure that some of my volunteers have profiles. 'For us, it’s a totally new way of talking to people and we know there are lots of people who aren’t as engaged.' Mr Greenwich also said that it was the first time that he had used the app to reach out to the electorate. But if it proved successful he wouldn’t rule out using other apps in the future. Ms Sharpe’s ads were paid for out of her campaign funds while Mr Greenwich’s is courtesy of campaign group Out For. Grindr is a smartphone app to facilitate casual sex for gay men . However, it was Mr Hibbins who was the original trailblazer. ‘This election we're using Grindr to reach voters in Prahran,' Mr Hibbins wrote on his Facebook page before the Victorian state election last November. 'We'll be using it to promote events, our support for equality and broader policies.' Mr Hibbins believed that although he was the first to use the strategy in Australia, the idea would take off as a popular campaign approach. Sam Hibbins used Grindr to send targeted messages to the homosexual community in his electorate in Prahan ahead of last November's state election in Victoria . Dutch and Irish politicians were the first to use Grindr to connect with voters. Dutch politician Jan-Bert Vroege used the app to campaign in March last year. He did not use pop up messages like Mr Hibbins however, rather transforming his own pre-existing Grindr account, changing his profile description to: ‘let’s have a date on March 19’ to promote a political event about gay issues. Last May, Irish politician Phil Prendergast used Grindr as part of her European Parliament re-election campaign but lost the seat.

"This herd of 30 deer roamed the streets at night as residents slept, completely unaware the animals had decided their gardens would make a nice, light snack. The herd of fallow deer live in a wooded area near the houses in Essex and at around 11pm, when the roads were deserted, they crept out of their home to eat the grass.

Amateur photographer Mark Bridger captured the deer on camera as they explored the streets and people's gardens . Photographer Mark Bridger captured the deer on camera as they explored around the houses and people's gardens. The 46 year old, who works as a graphic designer, said: 'I love to take photos of deer, and to see them in an urban environment was strange but satisfying when you got the shot. 'The deer were very, very skittish and they are aware that they only have one or two escape routes if they need to run. 'The slightest noise and they are off and for such a large animal they can disappear into the shadows in seconds.' Unfortunately for the unsuspecting home owners, it was their immaculately kept gardens which lead to the deer wanting to eat their grass and plants. Mr Bridger, from West Malling, Kent, said: 'There is a lack of natural woodland areas left for the deer, and for the number of fallow deer that are wild in the UK now.

'The grass and plants in the gardens were well looked after so the deer go where the food is, and it just so happens it is around normal houses.' Mr Bridger added that patience and staying silent were key when photographing this big herd of deer in Essex. He said: 'You have to be ultra quiet to do this type of photography, they are wild animals in an urban environment as so they are very nervous and disappear at the slightest hint of people. 'When we saw the group we parked up around the corner and got out of the car, then crept as quietly as we could to get into a position where you hope the deer will walk into. 'This is probably the hardest photography I've done.' Mr. Bridger said he had to have as much patience with the animals as possible because they were nervous of their new surroundings .

"A person's sexual orientation can determine how much money they will earn according to a new report that claims gay men face discrimination from employers. Based on the personal information provided by over 10,000 people in the 2012 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, the report states that lesbians earn 33 per cent more than heterosexual women. However the reason for the extra pay is due to the survey sample noting that they work about 20 per cent more hours, the University of Melbourne's Mark Wooden said. Based on the personal information provided by over 10,000 people in the 2012 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, the report states that lesbians earn 33 per cent more than heterosexual women . 'One explanation for the increased earnings and longer work hours of lesbians might be that this group are less likely to have children than heterosexual women,' he said. The HILDA Survey recorded that only 22 per cent of lesbian women between the ages of 30 and 49 had children three years ago, compared to almost 60 per cent of straight women. Gay men on the other hand, were found to earn about 20 per cent less than heterosexual men due to a lower rate of earnings' growth. The gap in pay only worsened for those who lived with a partner, despite lesbians living with their significant other recording higher wages than those without. 'We found that the wages of gay men are growing at a much slower rate than the wages of heterosexual males,' Prof Wooden said. University of Melbourne's (pictured) Mark Wooden said gay men  were found to earn about 20 per cent less than heterosexual men due to a lower rate of earnings' growth . 'Gay males who are most likely to be observably gay by employers—those who live with a same-sex partner—face larger earnings penalties than those who are discreet about their sexuality.' The report added that 'gay men are 16 per cent less likely to be employed and are substantially more likely to have several periods of joblessness than heterosexual men'. Although admitting that numerous factors contribute to the varying earnings across sexual orientation, Professor Wooden admitted that 'employer discrimination is likely a major part of the explanation for these wage gaps, especially in the case of gay men'. The findings are outlined in the Sexual Identity, Earnings, and Labour Market Dynamics: New Evidence from Longitudinal Data in Australia report.","Lesbians earn 33% more than heterosexual woman and work 20% more .

"Vietnamese Quoc Ta, 33, (pictured) had been deported from the UK twice before he was arrested  at Derby train station carrying £4,500 of cannabis . An illegal immigrant who had twice been deported from Britain was caught with 2.2lb of cannabis on a train - after sneaking back into the UK for a third time. Quoc Ta was jailed for eight months after a court heard how transport police officers boarded a carriage and noticed an overwhelming stench of cannabis. Local councillors yesterday said the case proves that Britain remains an ‘easy touch’ for foreign criminals despite Border Force attempts to claim down on the influx of offenders from abroad. Ta, from Vietnam, now faces being deported for a third time once he is released from prison after being caught with cannabis with a street value of up to £4,500 while sitting alone on the train at Derby station. The 33-year-old admitted possessing the class B drug with intent to supply. Ta first came to the attention of UK authorities in 2008 when he was arrested in connection with a burglary. He was not convicted but was deported to Vietnam. He was arrested in April 2012 after being recruited as a ‘gardener’ growing cannabis for a south-east Asian gang and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. On his release he was deported in December 2012. Derby Crown Court was not told how Ta made it back into the country for a third time, but prosecutor Karen Davenport-Coles said he was arrested in January when British Transport Police went on to the train where there was an ‘extremely strong smell of cannabis’. Laura Chaplin, defending, said, told the court on Monday that Ta, of Leeds, returned to the UK for a third time having been ‘the victim of a very serious assault in Vietnam, through owing money.’ She said a knife had been used in the attack and threats had been made against his family. Miss Chaplin said Ta had agreed to transport the cannabis for payment after finding himself ‘in a very desperate situation.’ Following the hearing, Councillor Alan Graves, leader of Derby’s UKIP group said: ‘Clearly, he’s not the sort of person we want in this country. I would imagine once he got into an EU country, he found it very easy to get back into this country. ‘He obviously wants to come to this country because we are an easy touch.’ Fellow councillor Lucy Care, deputy leader of Derby’s Liberal Democrats, said: ‘It doesn’t seem right to me that somebody that we’ve sent out of the country because he is not following our laws is able to get back in again so soon afterwards. It makes a mockery of having gone to the effort to get rid of him.’ A Home Office spokesman said all passengers entering the UK were ‘checked against police, security and immigration watch lists on arrival.’ He added: ‘Where we believe someone poses a risk, Border Force officers can - and do - refuse them entry. ‘Border Force officers use an array of search techniques including sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors, scanners and visual searches to find well-hidden stowaways on vehicles. Ta was arrested in January when British Transport Police went on to the train where there was an ‘extremely strong smell of cannabis’. He was arrested in April 2012 after being recruited as a ‘gardener’ growing cannabis . ‘Those subject to deportation orders face an indefinite ban from returning to the UK. They are entitled to apply to have the ban lifted after 10 years.’ Last August, a court heard how a Lithuanian burglar who was deported upon early release from prison was caught back in the UK just 12 days later. Police suspected Marius Siurkus, 32, returned to Peterborough to retrieve jewellery he had stolen during the burglary and hidden under floorboards. Incredibly, Siurkus’s accomplice in the burglary, countryman Mantas Pronckus, had also twice previously been freed from prison early and deported - only to return to the UK and continue offending on each occasion. The same month, 14-year-old Alice Gross disappeared after going for a walk along a canal near her home in Brentford, west London. The teenager’s body was later recovered from the River Brent. The badly decomposed body of the prime suspect in the murder, Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was found in a park one mile away in October, after it had been revealed the Latvian had been allowed into the UK despite being convicted of murder in his homeland. Foreign criminals make up about one in eight - or 11,000 - of all those behind bars in England and Wales.","Illegal immigrant was caught with 2.2lb of cannabis by transport police .

"Hundreds of pictures by the illustrator and cartoonist William Heath Robinson have been saved for the nation. The collection of 410 drawings and paintings, which includes many of his well-known First and Second World War cartoons, was put up for sale following the death of its previous owner. But now the William Heath Robinson Trust has been awarded a £250,000 grant by the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) and a further £50,000 by the Art Fund to secure the collection for British fans. Hundreds of pictures by the illustrator and cartoonist William Heath Robinson, including this picture of priests playing rugby, have been saved for the nation . Heath Robinson, whose name became a synonym for absurdly ingenious devices thanks to his wacky drawings, has been cited as an inspiration for numerous illustrators. Olympic cauldron designer Thomas Heatherwick and Nick Park, whose creation Wallace dreams up Heath Robinson-style devices while his dog Gromit looks on, have all named him as an influence. Illustrator Heath Robinson, whose name became a synonym for absurdly ingenious devices thanks to his drawings of complicated and wacky inventions - often for simple tasks . The collection includes satirical cartoons from both World Wars, such as Deceiving The Invader As To The State Of The Tide, with a British beach scene arranged on tall stilts in the sea to trick the Germans into believing they are in the shallows, part of a series looking at ways to resist an invasion. There are also examples from his series The Saintly Hun, which subverted the usual depiction of the German character during the First World War. And there is an almost complete set of drawings made for How To Build A New World, a book published in 1941 reflecting the hopes and aspirations of Britain in the Second World War. The collection was put on sale after Simon Heneage died  in 2011 and had been at risk of being broken up. It will now be displayed at the new Heath Robinson Museum at West House, Pinner, north west London, when it opens in April 2016, also includes rare rough early sketches and advertising commissions. It joins more than 1,200 items and places safeguarded by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, which exists to save the nation's best heritage in memory of those who gave their lives for the UK, ranging from the Mary Rose ship to a collection of the work of Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing. The collection includes many of his most well-known First and Second World War cartoons such as this one where two enemy soldiers meet in the middle as they attempt to dig underneath the trenches . The collection includes satirical cartoons from the wars, such as Deceiving The Invader As To The State Of The Tide, with a British beach scene arranged on tall stilts in the sea to trick the Germans into believing they are in the shallows . Carole Souter, chief executive of the NHMF said: 'These fantastically wry cartoons represent British humour at its best. Known as the 'Gadget King' Heath Robinson is best remembered for his drawings of farcically complicated machines which achieved very simple objectives. Born in 1872, he began by illustrating books such as Hans Christian Andersen's Danish Fairy Tales and Legends (1897) and Tales from Shakespeare (1902). During the First World War, he drew ever-more-unlikely secret weapons being used by the enemy while producing a stream of humorous drawings for magazines and advertisements. Most of his cartoons have since been reprinted many times in multiple collections and the term 'Heath Robinson' came to be known as an improbable, rickety machine barely kept going by incessant tinkering. One of his most famous series of illustrations were in Norman Hunter's Professor Branestawm book which featured a brilliant if eccentric professor and his inventions. 'With the new museum opening in 2016 and the country marking the centenary of the First World War, there's a renewed interest in Heath Robinson's work and we felt that it was important to keep this collection together for the nation to rediscover and enjoy.' Geoffrey Beare, of the William Heath Robinson Trust, said: 'These works provide a perfect complement to the Trust's existing collection, which is particularly strong in illustration.

"Five men are to appear in court this month to face football banning order hearings after a video which showed Chelsea fans being racially abusive to a black on on the Paris Metro went viral. Police said each of the men, who have not been named, have been served a summons and will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders'. Chelsea fans sparked outrage last month when they were filmed singing racist chants and refusing to let a black man on a train ahead of a Champions League match against Paris St Germain. Scroll down for video . This still shows Chelsea football fans on the Paris Metro pushing a passenger to prevent him from boarding. Police said five men will appear in court 'regarding a police application for football banning orders' A Metropolitan Police statement said the summonses were served today and yesterday. Football banning orders are issued by courts following a conviction for a football-related offence after a complaint by the Crown Prosecution Service or a local police force, the Home Office website says. They can last for between three and 10 years. Breaches of the orders can result in a sentence of up to six months in prison. Footage captured by a bystander before Chelsea drew 1-1 with Paris Saint-Germain appeared to show a man being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'. The commuter, Souleymane Sylla, 33, (pictured) said later he felt 'truly wounded to the bottom of my heart' The commuter, identified only as 33-year-old Souleymane, said later he felt 'truly wounded to the bottom of my heart'. He said: 'We're in 2015, aren't we, and we're in France. We're in a civilised country and when you are in a civilised country there are certain things you can't do. 'For me, it's a humiliation. I was humiliated in my country. I was humiliated in front of my family, humiliated in front of my mother and father.' The development comes on the day that the two teams meet in the return leg of the tie in London. They will compete for a place in the Champions League quarter-finals at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium tonight. Chelsea FC said previously it was 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved. Five people have also been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident. The club has reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris.

"These dramatic photographs capture the moment seven unexploded shells were detonated out at sea. The 40lb shells, which are believed to date from the 1860s, were sniffed out by a black Labrador named after Sir Barnes Wallis - the inventor of the bouncing bomb. His owner, John Brewin, phoned the emergency services after his dog dug up one of the shells during a walk in Sandwich Bay, Kent, on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Dramatic: The seven shells were detonated by bomb experts out at sea at Sanwich Bay, Kent . Explosion: The shells, which are believed to date from the 1860s, were sniffed out by a black Labrador . Sniffed out: Barnes Wallis the black Labrador . Experts from the Royal Logistics Corps Bomb Disposal Team arrived and, with Barnes' help, uncovered another six shells. They were taken out into the sea where they were safely detonated. Mr Brewin said it was not the first time his dog had found explosives. He said: 'These are not the first he has found.' 'The seven shells date from the 1860s and are 40lb Black Powder shells. 'The first one was found by my black Labrador Barnes Wallis and the others were then located by the local Coastguard Team, assisted by Barnes again.' Mr Brewin named his dog after Sir Barnes Wallis, a British aviation engineer who invented the 'bouncing bomb' used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943. Adrian Hendry, 43, who lives nearby, said: 'The explosion out at sea was incredible - a real blast. 'It's amazing that the dog that sniffed the bombs out is named after Barnes Wallis - an amazing coincidence really.' Uncovered: Bomb disposal experts arrived and, with Barnes' help, found another six shells on the beach . Curious: Owner John Brewin said the shells, pictured, are not the first to be dug up by his pet . Sir Barnes Wallis: Inventor of the 'bouncing bomb' Barnes Wallis was a British aviation engineer who is famous for designing the 'bouncing bomb' that was used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943. Born in Derbyshire, Wallis worked first as for a marine engineering firm before transferring to working on aircraft. When the Second World War began, Wallis was assistant chief designer of aviation at Vickers' engineering. He came up with the concept behind the bouncing bomb while skipping his daughter's marbles across a tub of water by catapault. But it took more than a year to convince RAF chiefs that such a bomb might work and should be attempted. Once he was given the go-ahead, he had only eight weeks to complete and test the design. The final solution, called Upkeep, was a cylindrical bomb, weighing four tons, spinning backwards at 500 rpm. It had to be dropped from precisely 60ft above the water at not more than 240mph. In the dark. In the middle of hilly, forested west German territory. Operation Chastise, dubbed the 'Dambusters Raid' was carried out overnight on the 16 May 1943 by the 617 Squadron of the RAF - specially-created for the job - that was led by Guy Gibson. Two of the dams were breached, leading to serious flooding of the surrounding area. However, it did not make a significant dent in the country's industrial production, as hoped. The most significant outcome of the raid was the positive effect it had on morale - giving Allied troops, and those left at home, a much-needed boost.

"It was one of the deadliest attacks during World War Two leaving more than 100,000 people dead and destroying large parts of Tokyo but is often forgotten from history. Now 70 years on, new before and after pictures have been released showing how the Japanese capital recovered after the firebomb strike that killed more than Nagasaki in a single night. On March 10, 1945, U.S. B-29 bombers flew over Tokyo in the dead of night, dumping massive payloads of cluster bombs. The raids left a fifth of Tokyo smouldering under an expanse of charred bodies and rubble. Scroll down for video . Survivors of the bombing of Tokyo commute through the streets of the Naakamise shopping street in the days after the city was attacked by US bombers . The same street today in Tokyo's Asakusa district showing the shops either side of the street and a visitor praying towards a Sensoji temple . The bombs on the single night 70 years ago destroyed a fifth of Tokyo including homes and infrastructure as well as the Sumida-gawa bridge, pictured . Seventy years on, a train runs over the re-constructed bridge as Japan's tallest building the 'Tokyo Sky Tree' looms in the background . A before and after picture shows the damage to the Matsuya department store in Tokyo and how it was re-developed after the end of the Second World War . Around 104,500 people died in the attack, making it the deadliest conventional air raid ever, worse than Nagasaki and on par with Hiroshima. But the attack, and similar ones that followed in more than 60 other Japanese cities, have received little attention and were eclipsed by the atomic bombings and Japan's postwar rush to rebuild. Where earlier raids targeted aircraft factories and military facilities, the Tokyo firebombing was aimed largely at civilians, in places including Tokyo's downtown Shitamachi area, where people lived in traditional wood and paper homes at densities sometimes exceeding 100,000 people per square mile. Exhausted residents also chose to pull blankets over their heads and sleep when air-raid sirens blew instead of heading to shelters turned icy by an unusually cold winter. Haruyo Nihei, was just eight when the bombs fell and was among many survivors who kept silent about that night until recently. A half-century passed before she even shared her experiences with her own son. Despite the massive bombing campaign, the Kamiya Bar, left, and the Matsuya Asakusa department store, right, remained standing . Today, the bar and the department store still remain as commuters in Tokyo cross the road outside the two buildings, which are still in use . She said: 'Our parents would just say, ""That's a different era."" 'They wouldn't talk about it. And I figured my own family wouldn't understand.' Ms Nihei, now 78, was mesmerised as she watched the attack from a railway embankment. She added: 'It was a blazing firestorm. I saw a baby catch fire on its mother's back. and she couldn't put out the fire. 'I saw a horse being led by its owner. The horse balked and the cargo on its back caught fire, then its tail, and it burned alive, as the owner just stood there and burned with it.' The destruction in the area around the Azuma Bridge after the Tokyo firebombing. The attack, and similar ones that followed in more than 60 other Japanese cities, received little attention . On the 70th anniversary of the bombing campaign a man walks near to the bridge among the modern high rise buildings which make up the Tokyo skyline . From January 1944 to August 1945, the U.S. dropped 157,000 tons of bombs on Japanese cities, according to the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey . The same area now, which is popular with locals and tourists and boasts of shops and restaurants. Japan rushed to rebuild their capital city at the end of the war . Masaharu Ohtake, then 13, fled his family's noodle shop with a friend. Turned back by firefighters, they headed toward Tokyo Bay and again were ordered back and they crouched in a factory yard, waiting as flames consumed their neighborhood. He explained: 'We saw a fire truck heaped with a mountain of bones. It was hard to understand how so many bodies could be piled up like that.' Survivors also speak of the hush as dawn broke over a wasteland of corpses and debris, studded by chimneys of bathhouses and small factories. From January 1944 to August 1945, the U.S. dropped 157,000 tons of bombs on Japanese cities, according to the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. Nine days after the bombing campaign, a man walks across the Azuma bridge among the devastation caused in Tokyo by the bombs . In an image taken from the same spot 70 years on, another man walks across the same bridge, with new buildings in the background . It estimated that 333,000 people were killed in total, including the 80,000 killed in the August 6 Hiroshima atomic-bomb attack and 40,000 at Nagasaki three days later. The bombing campaign set a military precedent for targeting civilian areas that persisted into the Korean and Vietnam wars and beyond. But the non-atomic attacks have been largely overlooked. Mark Selden, a Cornell University history professor said: 'Both governments, the press, media, radio, even novelists... decided the crucial story was the atomic bomb. 'This allowed them to avoid addressing some very important questions.' Destruction: The Matsuya Asakusa department store days after the firebomb campaign saw 2,000 tonnes of explosives dropped on Tokyo . Exactly 70 years ago on March 9, 1945, American warplanes launched a huge firebomb campaign against Japan by dropping 2,000 tonnes of explosives over Tokyo. The raids targeted a 16 square mile area across the Japanese capital, killing 104,500 civilians, making it the deadliest conventional air raid ever. The campaign began early on March 9, when U.S. Air Force crews met on islands off the coast of Japan for a military briefing. The plan was to attack Tokyo at a low level that evening using aircraft that were stripped of all of their guns. The decrease in weight meant that the planes were able to increase their bomb load capacity and speed when flying. It is believed that U.S. General Curtis LeMay said they were going to deliver a 'big firecracker'. The firebombing was aimed largely at civilians, in places including Tokyo's downtown Shitamachi area, where people lived in traditional wood and paper homes at densities sometimes exceeding 100,000 people per square mile. Around 334 bombers were used in the raid and exhausted residents chose to pull blankets over their heads and sleep when air-raid sirens blew instead of heading to shelters turned icy by an unusually cold winter. This meant that there was huge human carnage with the smell of burning flesh even making the pilots grab oxygen masks to stop themselves from vomiting.

"Husband-and-wife meth users disarmed a Colorado wildlife officer and a sheriff's deputy then forced them to their knees along a desolate mountain highway before the husband was killed in a struggle, police reports released Thursday show. The man had handcuffed the deputy and held both officers at gunpoint with their own weapons before the wildlife officer overpowered him, took back his gun and shot him to death Monday near the small town of Dinosaur in northwestern Colorado, about 10 miles from the Utah border. Neither officer was injured during the encounter that began after they found the couple's abandoned Ford Explorer on the side of the road. Outlaws: Georgie Hand, 43, faces charges of attempted first degree murder, second degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery among other charges. Her husband, James Damon, 46, was shot and killed by police . Georgie Hand, 43, faces charges including attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery and disarming a peace officer. Her husband, James Damon, 46, died at the scene. The police reports provide new details about the harrowing struggle. After finding the SUV, wildlife officer Nathan Martinez followed a set of footsteps to the couple, who were sitting on a hillside. Damon aimed a handgun at Martinez and ordered him to keep his hands up as Hand pulled the officer's weapon from his holster, the reports state. They forced Martinez to sit down and toss his radio onto the ground. Damon asked if he had a wife and kids, finally saying, ''How do we get out of this, how does everybody walk away alive?'' Hand told investigators, according to the reports. Pointing Martinez's own gun at him, the couple then led him down the hill toward Moffat County Deputy Bhrent Shock. Struggle: A Colorado sheriff's deputy and a state wildlife officer were held hostage by a husband and wife before a struggle erupted and the man was fatally shot. The officers have been suspended . Hand told investigators her husband pointed his gun at Shock's face and ordered him to the ground, where Damon stripped him of his gun, radio and stun gun before handcuffing his right hand to his duty belt. Damon then pressed the gun into the back of the deputy's head. Martinez threw the keys to his vehicle toward Damon and told the pair they could take it and go, according to the reports. Hand walked away and Martinez told investigators that Damon ordered the officers to their knees near the Ford. Martinez could see the deputy's handgun in one of Damon's hands and his own weapon in the other. 'At this point, Officer Martinez knew they were going to die, but he wasn't going to die without a fight,' the police report says. He 'made the decision to disarm Damon and get his own handgun back.' Some details of the struggle were hazy. Martinez told investigators he didn't remember at what point the gun fired, but that it malfunctioned before he was finally able to fire a shot into Damon's back. The officers then arrested Hand, who was still holding a handgun. A judge on Wednesday ordered Hand to remain in jail without bond. Court records do not list an attorney who could comment on the allegations against her. Hand told investigators she and Damon had been injecting meth at least once a day throughout the week, according to the reports. The pair were wanted in Wasatch County, Utah, on charges of burglary, theft and forgery, according to court records. They were accused of using a stolen credit card and checks to make thousands of dollars of purchases at a Wal-Mart and elsewhere in December. Authorities in Chaffee County, Colorado, were seeking them on suspicion of stealing credit cards, ski equipment, electronics and other items from cars and pawning them. Chaffee County authorities issued warrants for their arrests in February. Shock and Martinez have been placed on administrative leave, a standard practice after an officer-involved shooting. The district attorney's critical incident response team was investigating.","Georgie Hand, 43, faces charges of kidnapping, disarming a peace officer, felony menacing and aggravated robbery .

Babies were very much the order of the day for the Duchess, who was in Woolwich to meet volunteers helping out at Home-Start, a charity that helps more than 29,000 families a year. Its 15,000 volunteers visit clients in their homes, helping parents struggling to cope with issues such as isolation, mental ill health, bereavement, multiple births, illness or disability - many of which have a direct effect on their children. The Duchess declined a biscuit but listened intently as Rob Parkinson, CEO of Home-Start UK, outlined the work they did. Then it was on to meet some of the families who have received often life-changing help from the charity including Charlene Roper, 25 and her partner Graham Wilders Jnr, 32, who were with their impeccably behaved three-month-old daughter Francesca, the youngest of their three children. Kate also commiserated with some of the mothers at the coffee morning about sleeping patterns and feeding routines. ‘It can be hard, can’t it,’ she said sympathetically. ‘So often it’s about giving you the confidence to interact with your baby.’ She also spoke with a group of mothers, who did not wish to be identified, who had suffered with post natal depression. ‘The Duchess made clear in advance of the visit that she was keen to speak to them as post-natal depression can have such a knock-on effect on every aspect of family life,’ explained head of communications Annie O’Brian.

It is remarkable.’ Home-Start CEO Rob Parkinson said afterwards that he was delighted at how the visit had gone. ‘It doesn’t matter where you come from, when you are a mother there is a commonality there – something that the Duchess saw for herself today,’ he said. ‘She was brilliant in the way she chatted with the other mothers and seemed genuinely interested to learn more about our work. I think she left with a very good idea of what Home-Start is all about.’ Busy schedule: The visit is the Duchess' second in as many days and is part of her work as a champion for underprivileged families . Looking good: The Duchess of Cambridge cut a glamorous figure in her cheap chic maternity dress by online retailer ASOS . Kate, although eight months pregnant, has had a notably busy schedule of late and spent yesterday presenting sprigs of shamrock to the 1st Battalion, the Irish Guards. With husband Prince William, the Duchess watched as 200 soldiers from the regiment completed their traditional St. Patrick's Day parade in the square at the Mons Barracks in Aldershot. But while the Duke of Cambridge opted to get into the spirit of things at the reception afterwards and enjoyed a pint of Guinness, the Duchess, who had earlier struggled to attach a shamrock posy to the collar of Irish wolfhound Domhnall, sensibly stuck to water. While the Duchess of Cambridge was visiting children in Woolwich, Prince William at Buckingham Palace where he took part in a series of official audiences with the Queen. In what will be seen as a sign of the Duke's increasingly central role within the Royal Family, William joined his grandmother as she accepted the letters patent from the new Austrian and Nicaraguan ambassadors. Meeting ambassadors is a key part of the sovereign's role, with foreign representatives expected to visit the Queen to present their credentials when they arrive in the UK. Those returning home are also expected to call on the monarch and present her with their official letters of recall before leaving. While this is the first time that the Duke has joined the Queen for audiences, he has already begun to conduct investiture ceremonies, a role only performed by the monarch or direct heirs. Most memorable of his investitures so far was one that took place last month, in which he presented Dragon's Den star James Caan with a CBE and admitted to being a fan of the BBC show.

"She shot to fame as the relentlessly cheery but dim-witted Nursie, mocked by Lord Blackadder for her dotty, unworldly utterances. And it seems that in real life, actress Patsy Byrne was equally naive when it came to her own financial affairs – her newly released will reveals that she grossly underestimated the fortune she had amassed. Her instructions were that five of her six stepchildren should inherit £20,000 each, with the remainder of her estate going to the sixth. Scroll down for video . Patsy Byrne, right, who played Nursie in Blackadder died last year aged 80 leaving a £1.5 million estate . Ms Byrne, right, left £20k each to four of her daughters and the remainder of her estate to the fifth . However, the remaining share of Ms Byrne's estate was worth in the region of £900,000 . But when she died at the age of 80 last year, Ms Byrne actually left £1.5 million – leaving stepdaughter Monica Seccombe with a potential £900,000 legacy, after inheritance tax. Happily, Ms Seccombe has shared out the money equally with her four sisters; their brother Christopher having died last year at the age of 58, leaving no children. Ms Seccombe, a construction industry lawyer from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘When she drew up her will, she didn’t realise how much money she had. ‘Her estate will be distributed equally to all her stepchildren.’ And explaining why she had been in line for a bigger share of the legacy, Ms Seccombe added: ‘There was no family bust-up; she just wanted me to sort things out after her death as I am a solicitor.’ Another stepdaughter, Margaret Seccombe from Guildford, Surrey, said: ‘The largest part of the estate was left to Monica to distribute as she saw fit. There was no argument about it. My stepmother arranged it that way so there could be some flexibility just in case one of us had died or another of us was in poverty at the time of her death. There has been full consultation with all the family.’ Probate records released last week reveal that Byrne left £50,000 to both The Theatrical Guild, which supports backstage staff, and the Denville Hall care home for actors in Northwood, Middlesex, where she died last June. She had moved there a few months previously from Kennington, South London, when she became frail. The family also agreed to make a further £50,000 donation to St Joseph’s Hospice in Hackney, East London, and £20,000 to the Little Sisters Of The Poor Care Home in Kennington. Monica Seccombe added: ‘My stepmother also wanted some little things and mementoes to go to friends.’ A classically trained actress who toured with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Byrne became a household name in 1986 when she took the role of Nursie to Miranda Richardson’s petulant Elizabeth I in Blackadder II. The Rowan Atkinson sitcom was the highlight of a long career in theatre, which started when she attended drama school in London. She was on an RSC tour of Latin America in 1964 when she met widower Patrick Seccombe, who was the British Council representative in Uruguay. They wed in 1967 and the marriage lasted until his death in 2000. Byrne also starred in a BBC production of Chekhov’s Platonov in 1971, a 1979 adaptation of The Old Curiosity Shop and in children’s programme Maid Marian And Her Merry Men in the early 1990s – a show created for her by Blackadder co-star Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick. Ms Byrne's family said the money will be spilt equally as she designed her will to be flexible .","Patsy Byrne left £1.5million following her death last year at the age of 80 .

"The countryside is under siege from housing developers exploiting the Government’s relaxed planning laws, campaigners have warned. The number of homes planned for the country’s green belt has increased 38 per cent in less than two years, according to a study by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE). Nearly 220,000 houses are in the pipeline for green belt land – up 61,000 on CPRE’s last count in August 2013 – and the campaigners say the increase is a direct result of the Government’s National Planning Policy Framework, which aimed to speed up decisions and boost house building. The number of homes planned for the country’s green belt has increased 38 per cent in less than two years, according to a study by the Campaign to Protect Rural England . The framework, introduced three years ago, ordered planning boards to shift the ‘presumption’ of their decisions ‘in favour’ of development. The Coalition has repeatedly said that there were sufficient regulations in place to protect rural Britain from inappropriate developments. Just this month David Cameron said ‘the green belt is protected’ and that he viewed its continued preservation as ‘paramount’. But the new figures lay bare the extent to which developers have been able to move on to prime rural sites, where they are often able to charge a premium for luxury homes. In its analysis of nine English regions, the CPRE paper shows that councillors and planning inspectors have signed off major releases of green belt over the past 19 months. The Metropolitan green belt which encircles London is particularly under pressure, with the number of houses planned rising from 32,500 to 87,000 since the summer of 2013. Just over 12 per cent of England is designated as green belt land, a status introduced in the 1950s to protect the countryside around major towns and cities from urban sprawl. Campaigners say nearly 220,000 houses are in the pipeline for green belt land – up 61,000 on CPRE’s last count in August 2013 . They balme the increase is a direct result of the Government’s National Planning Policy Framework, which aimed to speed up decisions and boost house building . But a Daily Mail investigation revealed last year that speculators are so confident they can exploit new loopholes, they offer farmers ‘no-win-no-fee’ deals to get planning permission. The disdain with which some developers treat green belt land was revealed at the National Planning Summit in London this week. Mark Sitch, senior partner at planning consultancy Barton Willmore, told the conference that planning restrictions on rural land should be dismantled. He said: ‘The new government has to have the ambition and in that first year tackle the green belt. The green belt is a constraint on economic growth of our cities.’ Just over 12 per cent of England is designated as green belt land, a status introduced in the 1950s to protect the countryside around major towns and cities from urban sprawl. This Government and its predecessors have emphasised the need to build an estimated 200,000 new homes a year to battle the housing crisis. But campaigners say there is no need to concrete over the countryside to meet that aim. Experts estimate there is space for a million new homes on previously developed ‘brownfield’ sites, including disused industrial land and empty housing plots. Paul Miner, planning campaign manager at CPRE, said: ‘We need to strengthen green belt protection, not weaken it. ‘Our new research shows that large-scale development is already planned – despite existing protections, the availability of brownfield land and community objections.’ Planning minister Brandon Lewis last night defended the Government’s record. He said: ‘The green belt is 34,000 hectares larger than in 1997, and green belt development is at its lowest rate since modern records began in 1989. ‘This Government has safeguarded national green belt protection and increased protection of important green spaces.’","Campaigners warn homes planned on green belt land increased 38 precent .

"The stepfather of a teenager who has been missing for 20 days has been taken into police custody amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter. Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2 and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell, 36, was taken into custody on Saturday after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. Wesley has been locked up on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering. Scroll down for video . Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, left, has been missing since March 2 and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell, right, was taken into custody on Saturday after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours . Speaking from the Norfolk City Jail, Wesley said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will. 'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com. Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. He said he even punched the family dog out of anger. While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket. 'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said. 'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' Wesley is currently being held without bond and the Norfolk Police Department are not currently refering to him as a person of interest or a suspect in AJ's disappearance. Wesley Hadsell, left, has admitted breaking into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter AJ, right, against her will . Officially the cops have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects. During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition. He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states. On Saturday he told WAVY that he is a changed man. 'I want my daughter home,' he said. 'That's what I want and that's all I want. Anybody who wants to say something about that or get in the way of that, then I'm sorry. So what some ways are unorthodox. I didn't have anything to do with her disappearance. I don't know where she's at.' Police on Saturday spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road . Police on Saturday spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road. AJ's family and friends had started searching the area around 5 p.m. on Friday and found at least four items they believe belonged to her. Forensics teams spent Saturday collecting evidence in brown paper bags. Hadsell is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds. A Longwood University freshman, she was home for spring break and was last seen by a neighbor driving her car towards her parents' home on March 2 in Norfolk, Virginia. A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her. They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time.","Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2 .

"A woman came home from her local markets with more than she bargained for after unexpectedly giving birth on the grass amidst dozens of busy stalls. Kashelle Knox, 28, hadn't been expecting her second child to arrive for another ten days but the Brisbane mother from Fairfield told Daily Mail Australia that she knew it was time while waiting in a queue for food at the Boundary Street Markets. 'After a few contractions I was like, this baby is coming now whether I like it or not,' Mrs Knox said. Pictured in an ambulance after giving birth, Kashelle Knox unexpectedly went into labour while out for some dinner at the Boundary Street Markets . She gave birth to a baby boy, almost two weeks before her due date, as 3,500 market attendees looked on . Market manager David Bostock said he was informed by paramedics that a woman was delivering a baby beside the Wurst-Meister market stalls and a café (pictured) 'I called my midwife and got my friend to call my husband to come and pick me up. We knew this one was going to be faster than my first [child birth], but not that fast.' Mrs Knox gave birth within half an hour. By the time paramedics made it to the scene, the baby's head had already appeared and by the time her husband made his way over, his wife was presenting him with their newborn son. Market manager David Bostock told Daily Mail Australia that there were over 3,500 people at the market with 'music was playing in the background' when Mrs Knox gave birth. 'I was closing a stall up when an ambulance drove up the driveway and I rushed out thinking someone was in trouble. The paramedic said someone was delivering a baby beside the Wurst-Meister shop and the café,' Mr Bostock said. Mrs Knox's waters broke just after a friend arrived to take her home: 'That's when my midwife recommended I move to a quiet corner and so I moved five metres away and had the baby,' she said .

By the time paramedics made it to the scene, the baby's head had already appeared and by the time her husband made his way over, his wife was presenting him with their son . Her husband, Andrew (pictured with his newborn son), struggled to find someone to take care of the couple's first child so he could rush to his wife's side . 'People took their shirts off and were handing her towels and now they're all hanging on the market fence on coat hangers all ironed and pressed with beautifully written thank you notes saying 'thank you very much for helping and supporting the birth of our baby'. Mrs Knox admitted that while shy at first, and desperate for her husband to be there for the birth, she was forced to accept the circumstances. 'I told my friend I was feeling a bit funny, I was a bit nauseous, and as we were lining up for food I got more nauseous and said ""I'm just going to sit here"" and I was thinking I just needed to vomit,' she said. 'So I said ""I'm just going to lie over there and vomit"". I thought it was hunger nausea, but then I started having contractions. 'I was a bit hesitant to relax into the contractions because I knew Andrew (right) wouldn't make it., but after a few contractions I was like, this baby is coming now whether I like it or not,' Mrs Knox (left) said .

"A baby girl was found alive after being strapped in her car seat upside down for 14 hours while inside a partially submerged car in Utah's Spanish Fork River - but her mother did not survive the crash. Lily Groesbeck, 18 months old, was listed in stable but critical condition at Primary Children's Hospital on Sunday. Her mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, 25, from Springville, was found dead in the car, according to police. A fisherman found the crashed car upside down in the river on Saturday at 12.30pm, about 14 hours after the accident occurred around 10.30pm on Friday. A neighbor in the area reported hearing a loud noise near the bridge Friday night at about 11pm, but couldn't locate the cause of the sound after checking the area near Provo. Scroll down for video . Lone survivor: 25-year-old Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck (left) and her 18-month-old daughter, Lily (right), were found inside a crashed car in Utah's Spanish Fork river on Saturday.

Delayed response: A fisherman found the car partially-submerged upside down in the river Saturday afternoon, about 13 hours after the accident is believed to have occurred . Searching for answers: Officials respond to a report of car in the Spanish Fork River near the Main Street and the Arrowhead Trail Road junction in Spanish Fork, Utah . The red Dodge Caliber struck a cement barrier on the bridge and careened into the river, according to investigators. The car then landed under the bridge and was difficult to see from the road. Emergency responders who arrived at the scene on Saturday found the car on its top, partially submerged in the river. Groesbeck was found dead in the driver's seat but Lily was alive, seated above the freezing waters in the rear passenger seat - as the low-to mid 30-degree-temperature water never reached high enough to touch her. The child was first taken to Mountain View Hospital and then flown to Primary Children's Hospital in critical condition. 'She is doing remarkably well considering the circumstance. The doctors have been hopeful so far,' said Lynn's sister, Jill Sanderson on Sunday. 'We would like to express our appreciation to the Spanish Fork rescue team for saving the baby's life.' Sanderson said her sister was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life, according to KSL. Lynn was also the youngest of five children, including three brothers and her sister. 'She was very compassionate and a very loving person and always willing to bend over backwards for her loved ones,' said Sanderson. 'Her baby was the love of her life. She was an amazing mother.' Fighting for life: Groesbeck's 18-month-old daughter was reported to be in stable but critical condition at the hospital on Sunday . Tragedy: The red Dodge Caliber struck a cement barrier on the bridge and careened into the river, according to investigators . Mystery: Police said she was driving home from her parent's house in Salem Friday night when the accident happened . Officials with the Spanish Fork Police Department said Groesbeck was visiting her parents in Salem, Utah leaving their house around 10pm, and was returning to her home when the crash occurred on Friday night. 'I have been able to confirm that she had visited some family in Salem [Friday] night around 10 o'clock,' Lt Cory Slaymaker of the Spanish Fork Police Department told Fox 13. 'She left Salem between 10:00 and 10:30 last night, was heading home to Springville, the family didn't know that she did not arrive.' A neighbor heard the crash around 11pm, but couldn't find any signs of an accident on the roadway. 'Where the car was at, you couldn't see it from the roadway,' Slaymaker said. The temperature of the Spanish Fork river was so cold that three police officers and four firefighters who responded to the crashed car had to be treated for hypothermia at the hospital. They were all later released. The cause of the accident is still under investigation.

"Two sisters have defied the odds after giving birth within minutes of one another in the same hospital. Dwynwen Williams had her son Celt only three minutes after Iola Roberts gave birth to her daughter Mirain on February 19. Midwives gave the sisters, who live in Wales, beds side by side to each other in the same ward at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd hospital, after the births. Sisters Iola Roberts (left) and Dwynwen Williams (right) gave birth three minutes apart in the same hospital in adjacent rooms. The sisters are pictured here with Mirain (left) and Celt (right) The sisters, who were both overdue, had booked to be induced on separate dates but astonishingly both went into labour on February 19 this year . Dwynwen, 38, and Iola, 39, who both already had two children each, were thrilled to fall pregnant at the same time last year. Neither sister knew the other was pregnant, and the announcements were a huge surprise. They went through ante-natal appointments together, also at the same hospital. Iola, who lives in Nebo, North Wales, with husband Paul and their older children Brenig, six, and Brillaen, three, was given February 9 as a due date. While Dwynwen, who lives in Llangernyw, North Wales, with husband Dewi, a farmer, and their older children Mabon, seven and Llywarch, five, was due on February 13. Older sister Iola, who works as a nurse, said that despite their due dates being so close they had never expected to go into labour at the same time. She said: 'Everyone kept joking we might have the babies on the same day but I didn't think it was possible. The consultant-led unit where the sisters gave birth is currently under threat so both Iona and Dwynwen are both backing a national campaign supporting the unit. Pictured: Dwynwen with her three children in hospital . 'Both of my sons were born early so I expected this one to be the same.' But both babies were overdue and the sisters were booked in to be induced three days apart. However, both sisters went into labour before their appointments came. Dwynwen, 38, said: 'When I was on my way to hospital, I texted Iola to say what was happening, and I couldn't believe it when she sent one back to say she was also on her way.' Iola, who arrived at the hospital shortly after Dwynwen, added: 'When I arrived at the hospital, I was told I'd have to wait because there was someone in the treatment room being examined, and I replied: ""Tell her to get a move on!"" 'The midwife was shocked until she realised it was my sister.' The sisters were allowed on a ward together in the early stages of labour. They then gave birth in adjacent rooms, within three minutes of each other. Dwynwen said that having her sister there made the experience even more special. 'It was just so nice to have Iola around. It turned out she gave birth to Mirain at 1.11am, and I gave birth to Celt at 1.14am.' Iola agreed: 'It was like a family reunion on the ward. It was lovely having my sister next to me.' The mums were then given beds side by side in a maternity ward. After giving birth both of the sisters were kept on the same ward before travelling home the next day. Iona is pictured here at home with her two elder sons and baby daughter Mirain . Iola says that the amazing coincidence attracted a lot of attention from the staff in the hospital. 'The midwives couldn't believe what was going on. They said they'd never come across anything like it before, and people were taking photographs as the babies looked so similar and were almost the same weight.' Dwynwen's son, Celt, had a suspected heart murmur so they stayed in hospital for an extra night. But the next day he was given the all-clear and allowed home. The sisters are enjoying bringing up their babies together and hope they will grow up to be as close as they are. They are both also supporting a campaign to keep doctor-led maternity services at the hospital where the two cousins were born. The consultant-led unit is currently under threat of downgrade, but without it, the sisters say their story might not have been such a happy one. Dwynwen said: 'I needed a consultant with me all through the birth because of complications. If I hadn't been able to go to Glan Clywd I would have faced a much longer journey to hospital, meaning my baby could have been danger. 'People like me, living in rural areas, rely on Glan Clywd as a lifeline.' Both sisters are now backing a national campaign in Wales to keep doctor-led maternity services at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, in North Wales, where their babies were born.","Dwynwen Williams and Iola Roberts gave birth on February 19 .

"Scientists have revealed a huge breakthrough in the search for life on other planets. Nasa's Cassini spacecraft has provided scientists the first clear evidence that Saturn's moon Enceladus exhibits signs of present-day hydrothermal activity - similar to that seen in the deep oceans on Earth. If confirmed, it would make the moon Enceladus the only other known body in the solar system besides Earth where hot water and rocks interact underground. Hydrothermal activity occurs when seawater infiltrates and reacts with a rocky crust and emerges as a heated, mineral-laden solution, a natural occurrence in Earth's oceans. According to two science papers, the results are the first clear indications an icy moon may have similar ongoing active processes. Cassini team member Sean Hsu of the University of Colorado in Boulder used spacecraft observations and computer modeling to show that the plume is connected to what's happening on the lunar sea floor. Judging by their size and makeup, the team believes particles in the plume are the result of hot water coming into contact with rocks on the ocean floor. The resulting mineral-rich water then shoots up through the icy crust and erupts into space in a plume of gas and ice. Some particles settle around Saturn, replenishing its biggest ring. That activity would make the moon an even more attractive place in the hunt for microbial life. On Earth, scientists have found weird life forms living in hydrothermal vents on the ocean bottom where there's no sunlight. The implications of such activity on a world other than our planet open up unprecedented scientific possibilities, Nasa said. 'These findings add to the possibility that Enceladus, which contains a subsurface ocean and displays remarkable geologic activity, could contain environments suitable for living organisms,' said John Grunsfeld astronaut and associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. 'The locations in our solar system where extreme environments occur in which life might exist may bring us closer to answering the question: are we alone in the Universe.' Hydrothermal activity occurs when seawater infiltrates and reacts with a rocky crust and emerges as a heated, mineral-laden solution, a natural occurrence in Earth's oceans. According to two science papers, the results are the first clear indications an icy moon may have similar ongoing active processes. The first paper, published this week in the journal Nature, relates to microscopic grains of rock detected by Cassini in the Saturn system. An extensive, four-year analysis of data from the spacecraft, computer simulations and laboratory experiments led researchers to the conclusion the tiny grains most likely form when hot water containing dissolved minerals from the moon's rocky interior travels upward, coming into contact with cooler water. Temperatures required for the interactions that produce the tiny rock grains would be at least 194 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius). 'It's very exciting that we can use these tiny grains of rock, spewed into space by geysers, to tell us about conditions on -- and beneath -- the ocean floor of an icy moon,' said the paper's lead author Sean Hsu, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Cassini's cosmic dust analyzer (CDA) instrument repeatedly detected miniscule rock particles rich in silicon, even before Cassini entered Saturn's orbit in 2004. By process of elimination, the CDA team concluded these particles must be grains of silica, which is found in sand and the mineral quartz on Earth. The consistent size of the grains observed by Cassini, the largest of which were 6 to 9 nanometers, was the clue that told the researchers a specific process likely was responsible. On Earth, the most common way to form silica grains of this size is hydrothermal activity under a specific range of conditions; namely, when slightly alkaline and salty water that is super-saturated with silica undergoes a big drop in temperature. This illustration depicts potential origins of methane found in the plume of gas and ice particles that sprays from Enceladus, based on research by scientists working with the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer. 'We methodically searched for alternate explanations for the nanosilica grains, but every new result pointed to a single, most likely origin,' said co-author Frank Postberg, a Cassini CDA team scientist at Heidelberg University in Germany. Hsu and Postberg worked closely with colleagues at the University of Tokyo who performed the detailed laboratory experiments that validated the hydrothermal activity hypothesis. The Japanese team, led by Yasuhito Sekine, verified the conditions under which silica grains form at the same size Cassini detected. The researchers think these conditions may exist on the seafloor of Enceladus, where hot water from the interior meets the relatively cold water at the ocean bottom. The extremely small size of the silica particles also suggests they travel upward relatively quickly from their hydrothermal origin to the near-surface sources of the moon's geysers. From seafloor to outer space, a distance of about 30 miles (50 kilometers), the grains spend a few months to a few years in transit, otherwise they would grow much larger. The authors point out that Cassini's gravity measurements suggest Enceladus' rocky core is quite porous, which would allow water from the ocean to percolate into the interior. This would provide a huge surface area where rock and water could interact. The second paper, recently published in Geophysical Research Letters, suggests hydrothermal activity as one of two likely sources of methane in the plume of gas and ice particles that erupts from the south polar region of Enceladus. The finding is the result of extensive modeling to address why methane, as previously sampled by Cassini, is curiously abundant in the plume. The team found that, at the high pressures expected in the moon's ocean, icy materials called clathrates could form that imprison methane molecules within a crystal structure of water ice. Their models indicate that this process is so efficient at depleting the ocean of methane that the researchers still needed an explanation for its abundance in the plume. This June 28, 2009 image provided by NASA, taken by the international Cassini spacecraft, shows Enceladus, one of Saturn¿s moons. A new study published online Wednesday, March 11, 2015, in the journal Nature, suggests there are ongoing interactions between hot water and rocks beneath the surface of the icy moon. In one scenario, hydrothermal processes super-saturate the ocean with methane. This could occur if methane is produced faster than it is converted into clathrates. A second possibility is that methane clathrates from the ocean are dragged along into the erupting plumes and release their methane as they rise, like bubbles forming in a popped bottle of champagne. The authors agree both scenarios are likely occurring to some degree, but they note that the presence of nanosilica grains, as documented by the other paper, favors the hydrothermal scenario. 'We didn't expect that our study of clathrates in the Enceladus ocean would lead us to the idea that methane is actively being produced by hydrothermal processes,' said lead author Alexis Bouquet, a graduate student at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Bouquet worked with co-author Hunter Waite, who leads the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) team at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Cassini first revealed active geological processes on Enceladus in 2005 with evidence of an icy spray issuing from the moon's south polar region and higher-than-expected temperatures in the icy surface there. With its powerful suite of complementary science instruments, the mission soon revealed a towering plume of water ice and vapor, salts and organic materials that issues from relatively warm fractures on the wrinkled surface. Gravity science results published in 2014 strongly suggested the presence of a 6-mile- (10-kilometer-) deep ocean beneath an ice shell about 19 to 25 miles (30 to 40 kilometers) thick.","Experts describe 'remarkable' discovery on Saturnian moon .

"A couple who kept dozens of animals in such squalid conditions that two of them had to be put down have been jailed for a total of six months. June Harding, 46, and husband Paul, 45, of Montacute, Somerset, kept their 31 dogs, seven cats and four guinea pigs to sleep in such filthy surroundings that RSPCA officers were overwhelmed by the stench of ammonia and had to call off the visit. Their water supplies were so dirty they had turned black and many of the animals suffered infected eyes, rotting teeth and ulcers as they lay in their own feces. Scroll down for video . June Harding, 46, and husband Paul, 45, of Montacute, Somerset, left their 31 dogs, seven cats and four guinea pigs to sleep in such filthy surroundings that RSPCA officers were overwhelmed by the stench of ammonia and had to call off the visit . Police who visited their home had to abandon the search because of the overbearing stench of ammonia and RSPCA inspectors described the conditions as 'appalling'. They managed to save 40 of the animals but every single animal rescued had respiratory problems due to the lack of ventilation and vets recommended two were put down. The pair were each sentenced to 12 weeks in prison at Taunton Magistrates Court in Somerset after pleading guilty to a total of 28 charges of animal neglect. Sentencing, Chair of the Bench Clive Powell said it was the worst case he had seen in 30 years. 'My stomach churned when I saw the pictures provided by the RSPCA,' he said. 'It is the court judgment that the totality of the offending and culpability mean that nothing sort an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate. Their water supplies were so dirty they had turned black and many of the animals suffered infected eyes, rotting teeth and ulcers as they lay in their own faeces . 'Between us we have 60 years experience, 30 years myself. 'I don't recall in that near?y 30 years any office as serious as this involving so many animals in such a poor state.' The court heard how police officers first visited the couple's home in Montacute, Somerset, on May 6 last year. Matthew Knight, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: 'Mr Handing was reluctant to let police into the property. 'The officers noted the poor quality of the house and abandoned their search on health and safety grounds.' Police returned with the RSPCA on June 30 and found similar conditions. 'In general the interior was filthy,' said Mr Knight. 'There was an overpowering smell of ammonia that is a product of wee. 'A number of officers had to leave the property due to the smell. The hallway of this property was was covered in dirt, hair and faeces. 'The living room - little natural light with puddles of urine on the floor. 'There was a very small window ajar. This seemed to be the only form of ventilation. The pair were each sentenced to 12 weeks in prison at Taunton Magistrates Court in Somerset after pleading guilty to a total of 28 charges of animal neglect . 'There was a room at the back called the cat room. 'Six cats were found. They seemed frightened and lived inside old chairs. 'The windowsill was covered in faeces.' However, during interview Mrs Harding said she believed the animals were 'fit and well'. Clive Rees, mitigating, said that Mrs Harding genuinely thought she was looking after the animals while Mr Harding had tried to distance himself from the situation. He said: 'The pair did not inflict anything on the animals that they did not inflict on themselves. 'Clearly they were having to live in the premises and were blind to the fact it was in such a mess. 'Their intention was to look after the animals but the care of the animals was not adequate.' Mr Harding was found guilty of all 16 offences on February 11 - 13 of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and three of failing to meet needs of the animals. Mrs Harding pleaded guilty to 12 charges on December 16 - nine of causing unnecessary suffering and three of failing to meet the needs of the animals. The couple were also banned from keeping animals for life and also banned from contesting the order for 10 years. Many of the animals have since been rehomed thanks to the RSPCA. An appeal against the sentence has already been lodged but bail was denied while it is processed.","June Harding, 46, and husband Paul, 45, of Montacute, Somerset, kept their 31 dogs, seven cats and four guinea pigs to sleep in filthy surroundings .

"A former chief constable is being sued by the police force where he used to work in a bid to recover £85,000 in 'golden handcuffs' payments he received for staying in his job. Roger Baker was employed by Essex Police on a salary of £139,000, but bonuses and expenses took his total pay above £200,000 a year. The payments included £85,000 to reward him for staying at the force - but the area's police commissioner now disputes these bonuses, and has launched a legal challenge to claw them back. Mr Baker was chief constable of Essex Police between 2005 and 2009, when he left the force with a £60,000 bonus for three months' work. Row: Roger Baker, left, was paid £85,000 by Essex Police in a 'golden handcuffs' deal which is now being challenged by police commissioner Nick Alston, right . He went on to work for Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, the police watchdog, where he was responsible for monitoring 'value for money' in police forces around the country. The 56-year-old former policeman is now a director at Colchester Hospital, paid £11,000 a year for working four days out of every month. Mr Baker was deputy chief constable of North Yorkshire police before moving to Essex, where he forged a reputation as an advocate of 'bobbies on the beat'. He became known for controversial policies such as banning officers from wearing sunglasses when they talked to the public, and was criticised in a report because he insisted on sending an officer to the scene of every single reported crime. Roger Baker gained a reputation as an outspoken advocate of beat policing during his time as chief constable of Essex Police - but officials accused him of wasting taxpayers' money on needless intervention. The 56-year-old spent 32 years as a police officer, starting his career in Derbyshire before becoming assistant chief constable of Staffordshire Police and deputy chief constable of North Yorkshire Police. In 2005, he was appointed as the top officer in Essex, where he courted controversy with his traditionalist brand of policing. Mr Baker instructed officers to interview everyone who claimed to be a victim of a crime, rather than simply giving them a reference number, and also targeted low-level criminality such as vandalism. After the police watchdog said that attending every crime scene 'is not always necessary and can be time-consuming', Conservative MPs stood up for Mr Baker's unconventional methods. He retired from the force in July 2009, and soon took a new job with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, where he monitored police forces for whether or not they were providing value for money. Mr Baker then led a review of police relationships with the media and other external bodies, before stepping down from HMIC last year. The area's now-defunct police authority is understood to have given Mr Baker three payments totalling £85,000 to reward him for his loyalty to the force. In total, he was paid around £150,000 in bonuses and expenses for his last 15 months of work at Essex Police. Essex police and crime commissioner Nick Alston claimed in 2013 that Mr Baker's 'golden handcuffs' deal fell outside payment regulations set by the Home Secretary. He said today: 'I have continued to progress this matter robustly, always seeking to achieve a resolution that is in the best interests of the people of Essex. 'I can confirm that I have now commenced legal proceedings to seek to recover £85,000 plus interest from Mr Baker. 'As legal proceedings are now active, I am unable to say anything further about this specific case.' Mr Baker was unavailable to comment on the controversy. Last month, it emerged that the former chief constable of Cleveland Police would be able to keep the vast majority of a £500,000 bonus pot which the force claimed had been wrongly paid to him. Sean Price agreed to repay just £23,000 despite being sacked from his job after lying about the recruitment of the former police authority chairman's daughter. In 2013, North Yorkshire's police commissioner was forced to abandon her attempt to reclaim £100,000 in allowances paid to the force's former chief constable and his deputy. The pay of chief police officers is now being investigated for the first time by the Senior Salaries Review Body, which provides independent advice to the Government.","Roger Baker received 'retention payments' totalling £85,000 to persuade him to stay at Essex Police .

"Most pregnant women can’t help but feel apprehensive about the pain that they will experience when they give birth, but the consequences of not feeling anything at all are far more horrific. Marie Delanote, 34, didn't suspect a thing when her fourth child, Eloise, came into this world in May, 2012. In fact, she thought that she had soiled herself. It wasn’t until she noticed her baby’s head dangling between her legs that she realised in horror that it was arriving four months too early. Scroll down for video . Marie and her daughter Eloise, who is now almost three years old . She said: ‘I thought I was fine, but when I got up and went to the bathroom and my baby came out - it was extremely dramatic.’ Marie, who lives in Basildon, Essex, with her husband Andrew Seakins, 50, had already had three children; Jack, nine, Adam, eight, Orla Jane, four, by the time she fell pregnant with Eloise. So she knew that when her waters broke just after 23 weeks of pregnancy that something was very wrong. She said: ‘I didn't expect it to be an early birth at all because my three other pregnancies were all full term. 'I had been quite ill just a couple of weeks before, I had a very bad throat infection around 21 weeks pregnant, which turned into streptococcus A. ‘Then ten days later I lost my mucus plug and I started wobbling – just three days later, my waters broke.’ Eloise in Neonatal Intensive Care at Portsmouth Hospital . Marie was rushed to Basildon hospital but the staff there were unable to deal with babies born more prematurely than 27 weeks and instead arranged for her to be admitted to Portsmouth hospital, two hours drive away. After administering her with an injection that helps babies to develop lungs in the womb quicker if they are at risk of premature birth, Marie was taken by ambulance to Portsmouth. Eloise weighed just 1lb when she was born . Once there, Marie had just two days to settle in before the shock birth occurred. She said: ‘I thought I had to go to the toilet - I thought I had been blocked for several days but unconsciously had not been wanting to let go because of the baby. ‘As I went into the bathroom, I thought I had defecated, but there was a mirror in front of the toilet and as I looked up, I saw this tiny little head between my legs, so I knew what was happening. ‘I pulled the emergency cord and within seconds, the midwives and the neonatal intensive care unit were there. ‘Two of the midwives supported me while the third one helped to deliver Eloise. ‘I didn't feel anything because she was so small. ‘She was as big as my hand, she fitted on my hand - she was really, really small. ‘Luckily I was in hospital because she was given to the doctors within seconds and they put breathing tubes in her.’ But being born so premature wasn’t the only battle facing Eloise, she had also severely ill after picking up streptococcus A and B from her mother. Marie said: ‘She was infected by the streptococcus A and B, because in the meantime I had also developed streptococcus B. ‘So, as she came out and we weren't prepared, she picked that up too. ‘She was pus-covered, she was smelly, she made no attempts to breathe and she also had two small bleeds in her brain - it didn't look very positive.’ Marie practised reiki and psychic surgery on her daughter alongside traditional medicines given by the NHS . But while the future looked bleak for her daughter, Marie, who works as a spiritual healer, says that as she was put back into her hospital bed and her baby was rushed to the intensive care unit, she was possessed by total calm. She said: ‘I had this spiritual calm come over me, knowing that I had to do the healing I've learnt and that all would be well. ‘The comments from the doctor weren't good because that's how the situation was, but I refused to have any negative dust in my mind.’ As the doctors used their traditional medicine on Eloise, Marie supplemented it with Reiki and what she called ‘psychic surgery’. She believes it was a combination of these two methods that enabled Eloise to fight through. Father Andrew with his daughter Eloise in hospital . Marie said: ‘I would do Reiki, which is universal energy giving. ‘It was like her physical battery was very low and mine was full, so by putting my hands on her, I charged her battery. ‘It comes from my head, through my hands, into her body and this made her able to fight better and overcome everything. ‘I would also do psychic surgery, which is healing with the mind. ‘I would imagine her blood with the bacteria in it and imagine sucking it out of the blood, so I can see it flowing beautifully. ‘It's all about the positive mind and intentions. ‘I strongly believe it was the collaboration between medical and spiritual healing that made her so good.’ When Eloise was taken home, she has to continue to be given oxygen . After four months and two days in hospital, Eloise was finally well enough to go home. Doctors took the precaution of hooking Eloise up to a portable oxygen tank for the following eight months. Marie said: ‘She was on home oxygen but an incredibly small amount - 0.02 of home oxygen so a very low flow. ‘But that's because it was in September and autumn was coming, so they took no risks. ‘It was quite difficult because a small baby is attached to oxygen anywhere you go. ‘You have a bottle underneath your pram and everyone is looking at you and wondering what's wrong with your baby. ‘She was on that until April - a month before her first birthday and then she just came off it.’ Eloise is now a healthy two year old girl . Marie (right) with Eloise, and her other children from left: Adam, eight, Jack, nine, and Orla Jane, four . Since then, the family haven’t looked back – Eloise is now as healthy as any other child her age. Marie said: ‘She sailed through for a baby who had given birth ill and so early. ‘One in ten who are born that prematurely are healthy and have no long term problems, but she wasn't just premature, she was also ill when she was born. ‘Most children born at this age have chronic lung disease, but she has been followed up by the NHS incredibly well. The Healing of the 1lb Baby by Marie Delanote . ‘These Micro Preemies [babies born before 26 weeks gestation] are also at the risk of major eye problems, blindness, healing problems, growth problems and development problems in movement.' 'But the specialist told me even when she was one year old that she’s a miracle.’ ‘She went to nursery when she was one year old and she has had no more coughs and colds than any other children.’ ‘I saw the specialist in Romford six months ago and she has fully caught up with her age group which is a miracle for that kind of baby. ‘I'm 100 per cent convinced that it was the co-operation between the spiritual and medical. ‘She's very special. 'All of my children are special to me but when you go through something like that, it makes them extra special.’ The Healing of the 1lb Baby by Marie Delanote (published by Clink Street, RRP £6.99, ebook RRP £2.99) is available to purchase from online retailers including amazon.co.uk and can be ordered from all good bookstores.","Marie Delanote, 34, from Basildon, Essex, gave birth 17 weeks early .

"After helping families tackle domestic violence as a welfare officer, a Sydney woman has herself become an alleged victim of the epidemic. In a family marred by tragedy, Salwa Haydar became its latest casualty on Monday night when her husband allegedly stabbed the 45-year-old mother to death in their southern Sydney home. Police accuse Haydar Haydar, 58, of killing his wife some time after 6.30pm, before handing himself into Kogarah police station at 7pm. They said the couple's 18-year-old daughter Ola Haydar tried to intervene but suffered serious hand injuries and was taken to hospital. Salwa Haydar was 'violently' murdered in her Bexley home in Sydney's south on Monday evening . Police have charged Haydar with the murder of his wife and wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm in relation to the injury to his daughter. The brutal attack was a shock to former employer, Arab Council CEO Randa Kattan, who knew Mrs Haydar for her work helping other families through domestic violence and troubled times. 'She was very caring, for her family or to her clients,' Ms Kattan told AAP. 'We are absolutely shocked and devastated.' There had been no indication of domestic violence in Ms Haydar's Bexley home, she said. When she died, Ms Haydar had been working for Quitline. Mrs Haydar's death comes nine years after her mother was killed in a bombing in southern Lebanon. She was heartbroken when she learned of the loss via a news report. Her daughter Ola Haydar (pictured) was also injured in the attack, which allegedly took place at the hands of Mrs Haydar's husband Haydar Haydar . 'They said one of the people that (was) killed was my mum, and they said her name and I just went in shock. Like ... I screamed, I hit myself, I said, `It can't be my mum',' she told ABC's Lateline at the time. 'I can't believe it, I still can't believe it.' Superintendent David Donahue said a post mortem revealed the alleged killing was brutal. 'It was quite a violent attack,' he said. 'It's disturbing.' The couple's teenager Ola remains in a Sydney hospital where she is being treated by a specialist surgeon. Haydar will remain in custody following a Kogarah Local Court appearance on Tuesday where he did not apply for bail. Mrs Haydar is pictured here in 2007, speaking about the death of her mother who died in a a bombing in southern Lebanon . He briefly looked to a group of supporters in court on Tuesday, who left in tears after police led him away. Magistrate Christine Haskett adjourned the case until April 9 at Central Local Court. Superintendent Donahue said police were still searching for a motive. '(Domestic violence) is a matter that we deal with the most,' he said. 'We deal with it every day.' In the 12 months to September 2014, 24 women in NSW were victims of domestic-violence related murders. In a similar vein Destroy the Joint has been 'counting dead women', in a campaign aimed at highlighting the domestic violence epidemic in Australia. According to their findings Mrs Haydar is the 26th woman to die a violent death in Australia in 2015 alone. Of those 26, 18 of the deceased knew the alleged perpetrator.

"Gruesome new images have emerged showing Islamic State militants stoning a blindfolded and bound man and woman to death in Iraq after they were accused of having sex before marriage. Taken in the ISIS-stronghold of Mosul in Nineveh province, the shocking images show a large crowd gathered to watch the jihadis murder the defenceless couple. Young boys clamber onto their fathers' shoulders to get a better view of the man and woman being charged with 'fornication', before the familiar white-bearded face of ISIS's elderly Mosul-based executioner-in-chief Abu Ansar al-Ansari orders their stoning to death. Stoned to death: Taken in the ISIS-stronghold of Mosul in Nineveh province, the shocking images show a large crowd gathered to watch the ISIS militants murder the defenceless couple . Accusation: An Islamic State militant with a yellow scarf covering his face is  seen using a microphone and PA system to read out the charge of 'fornication' -or sex outside marriage - against the couple . The sickening images begin by showing a large crowd gathered in a rain-drenched square in central Mosul. With heavily armed militants taking up positions on ledges overlooking the crowd, the young men and boys jostle to ensure they get the best view of the murder . In the background of the image, women wearing black niqabs are seen gathered together. An Islamic State militant with a yellow scarf covering his face is then seen using a microphone and PA system to read out the charge of 'fornication' against the couple, suggesting they have been accused of having sex without being married, not of committing adultery. A large pile of stones are then seen heaped in the middle of the road, before the barbaric ISIS militants began throwing them at the defenceless and blindfolded couple, who have had their hands bound to prevent them getting away. As stones rain down on the victims' bodies, large pools of blood appear in the road, before eventually the man and woman die of their injuries and the savagery finally comes to an end. Bloodthirsty: With heavily armed militants taking up positions on ledges overlooking the crowd, the young men and boys jostle to ensure they get the best view of the murder . Preparing to kill: After the charges are read out, the familiar white-bearded face of ISIS' elderly Mosul-based executioner-in-chief Abu Ansar al-Ansari (centre) orders their stoning to death . The images emerged as Iran's Revolutionary Guard this morning said a U.S. drone strike killed two of its advisers in Iraq, though the U.S. said it has only struck militants in its campaign against ISIS. The claim came as negotiators  attempted to reach a deal on Iran's contested nuclear program, which hard-liners in the Islamic Republic have opposed as giving away too much to the West. The Guard said on its sepahnews.ir website the strike happened March 23, just after the U.S.-led coalition began airstrikes to support Iraqi forces trying to retake the Islamic State-held city of Tikrit. It identified the dead as Ali Yazdani and Hadi Jafari, saying they were buried yesterday. It called them advisers, without elaborating on whether Iran contacted Iraqi or U.S. forces after the strike. Iran occasionally reports on the death of its forces in Iraq and Syria, where it is backing embattled President Bashar Assad, but this is the first time Iran has said it has lost forces in an attack by the U.S. in those campaigns. Barbaric: The Islamic State militants begin throwing stones at the defenceless and blindfolded couple, who have had their hands bound to prevent them getting away . Horrific: Young boys clamber onto their father's shoulders to get a better view of the sickening murder . Militants fighting for the Islamic State have now turned their savagery on the dead, tearing down graves and smashing tombs at a cemetery in Syria. Not content with the rape and massacre of the estimated four million brutally oppressed people living under the terror group's control in  Syria and Iraq, ISIS jihadis are now victimising the dead. Claiming gravestones and tombs are a form of veneration of the dead and only distract from the worship of Allah, the heavily-armed, camouflage-wearing militants are seen happily reducing the hilltop cemetery to piles of rubble. The chilling images are believed to have been taken in the Syrian province of Raqqa and shows a hilltop cemetery overlooking what appears to be farmland. Having parked their motorcycles at the gates of the graveyard, the militants are seen inside pulling over tombstones while sympathisers stand alongside them taking photographs. The U.S.-led coalition began a campaign of airstrikes and reconnaissance missions around Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown, on March 21 in support of large-scale operations to retake it after Iraqi efforts had stalled. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said: 'The international coalition is aimed at Daesh only,' using an alternate Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. 'All airstrikes are carried out at the request of the Iraqi government and in full coordination with the (Iraqi) Ministry of Defense,' the embassy said, without directly addressing the Iranian claim. ISIS now controls a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria. The U.S. began airstrikes against the group in August, while Iran has offered advisers and other assistance to Iraq to fight the extremists. The offensive to retake Tikrit largely has been waged by Iraqi troops and Shiite militias advised by General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Guard's elite Quds Force. Several Shiite militias announced last Thursday that they would boycott the Tikrit operations due to U.S. involvement. But General Lloyd Austin, the head of U.S. Central Command, told a Senate hearing Thursday that the U.S. agreed to Iraqi government requests to support the operation on the condition that the militias wouldn't be involved. Mouin al-Kadhimy, a spokesman for the Popular Mobilization Units, the government-backed body overseeing the various militias, said it was not aware of reports that Iranians were killed near Tikrit. New images have emerged showing dozens of black balaclava-wearing extremists graduating from an Islamic State-run school of terror in northern Syria. Brandishing AK47 assault rifles and waving flags carrying the sinister black and white ISIS logo, the photographs showing the jihadi 'Class of 2015' are believed to have been taken in Raqqa city.

"Tony Blair is said to be planning to step back from his role as the Middle East peace envoy . Tony Blair is to step back from his role as Middle East peace envoy, it was reported last night. The former Labour leader has been the envoy for the Middle East Quartet peace negotiators – the UN, the EU, Russia and the US – since he quit as Prime Minister in 2007. But the Financial Times said he was planning to ‘step back’ from the job, in a move which could be announced later this week. He is apparently embarking on negotiations to ‘recast’ his role while remaining involved in the peace process. It is understood that the former Prime Minister has met John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, to discuss a possible job change. The move follows months of concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Mr Blair’s role in peace negotiations in the Middle East and his business pursuits. Sources told the FT that Mr Blair has realised that his peace role is no longer tenable. The move comes amid mounting unease in the US and EU over his poor relations with senior Palestinian Authority figures and sprawling business interests. Senior diplomats told the paper Mr Blair was being eased out of the position. ‘It is long overdue,’ said one who had been briefed on the discussions. ‘He has been ineffective in this job. He has no credibility in this part of the world.’ Another person close to the Obama administration said: ‘Tony Blair is neither an asset nor a liability, but his current role is no longer viable.’ Mr Blair does not disclose any of his clients, but they have included countries such as Peru, Colombia, Kuwait, Vietnam and Kazakhstan. His corporate roster has featured PetroSaudi, an oil company with links to the Saudi royal family, finance firm JPMorgan and Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi wealth fund. A senior western official familiar with the Quartet denied there had been any ‘effort to push Blair out of his current role’. It is understood that any decision would need to be taken by consensus. Mr Blair advises a number of foreign governments, many of which have unpalatable human rights records. Last year, a group of former British ambassadors joined a campaign calling for the ex-Prime Minister to be removed from his role as Middle East envoy, raising objections to the possible clash with his business interests and a attempts to ‘absolve himself’ of responsibility for the Iraq crisis. Their letter, written last July, said the former Prime Minister’s achievements as Middle East envoy have been negligible and he was guilty of seeking to please the Israelis. The former prime minister was accused by a handful of British ambassadors of trying to please the Israelis. He is pictured above Israel's Shimon Peres . At the time, a spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘These are all people viscerally opposed to Tony Blair with absolutely no credibility in relation to him whatsoever. ‘He believes passionately in the two-state solution but believes that can only be achieved by a negotiation with Israel.’ Critics also point out that peace between Israel and Palestine is as far away as ever – and that the situation in Iraq and Syria is only getting worse. A US-led push to revive the Middle East peace process collapsed last year. Mr Kerry has expressed a wish that whatever government is brought to power in the Israeli elections this week will ‘meet the hope for peace’. There was no response from Mr Blair’s office last night. Only last month it emerged that Mr Blair is being paid to advise the Serbian prime minister. His private consultancy firm has sealed a contract to set up a ‘delivery unit’ paid for by the United Arab Emirates. His critics highlighted links between Abu Dhabi – the UAE’s capital – and a controversial Palestinian exile, Mohammed Dahlan, who has made no secret of his desire to become the next Palestinian leader. Abu Dhabi is allegedly bankrolling his campaign to unseat the current president, Mahmoud Abbas.","The former Labour leader has been the envoy since quit as Prime Minister .

"This mother of five has never been in labour for more than two hours - and she remarkably manages to beat her delivery record every time she gives birth. Mary Gorgens, who has never been given much warning before she goes into labour, has continued her stretch of speedy deliveries giving birth to her latest child in just two minutes. Even though the 35-year-old from Sydney has earned herself a reputation of rapid-fire births, nothing could have prepared her for the latest delivery on January 30. Mary Gorgens, 35, was given just two minutes warning before she gave birth to her son Brody  on the floor of her Sydney bedroom on January 30 . Rapid fire births: Mary and Simon Gorgens have had five children (Ava, Mila, Brody, Max and Sienna) and all births have been quicker than the last . Ms Gorgens went to the toilet in the early hours of the morning after feeling a slight twinge but had to quickly 'waddle' back to the bedroom when she felt her son's head starting to come out. She woke her husband Simon who stumbled to the bathroom thinking he had some time. When he came back, the 40-year-old found his wife on all fours and two minutes later he was holding his son Brody in his arms. 'I had no inkling, no feeling, no pain. He was two days early, I really wasn't expecting it that day,' Ms Gorgens told Daily Mail Australia. Luckily, the Gorgen family are used to these rapid-fire births. When she gave birth to their first child Max in December 2008, Ms Gorgens made it to the hospital with just 12 minutes to spare. The couple's eldest son Max was born in December 2008. It took just two hours from the time Mary felt the first twinge and they made it to the hospital with just 12 minutes to spare . It took 90 minutes for baby Ava to arrive in August 2010 when she was born on the way to the hospital. She was still in her amniotic sack and the midwife found her inside her mother's pants . 'I wasn't even sure I was in labour. I called my husband and then the pain came really quickly. By the time he got home I was ready to push and I could feel the head,' she said. 'We waddled up to maternity and they ran out – I was screaming at that point. They rushed me into delivery and threw me up on to the bed. 'One push and the head was out and one more and then his body came out. We got to the hospital at 10.22am and Max was born at 10.34am.' It took two hours for Max to be born from the time Ms Gorgens felt the first twinge. 'The next two were born in the car and the other two at home,' she said. 'I haven't had any pain relief in any birth because there hasn't been enough time.' The couple's second child Ava was born in 90 minutes in August 2010. Sienna was born in December 2011 when her dad pulled onto a median strip en route to the hospital. Mary was 50 minutes into labour when Ava arrived . Mary and Simon didn't even make it to the car when Mila was born in March 2013. The couple were given 10 minutes warning before the baby popped out on the bedroom floor . Mary went to the toilet  after feeling a slight twinge but had to quickly 'waddle' back to the bedroom when she felt her son's head starting to come out. Her son Brody was born just two minutes later in her bedroom . 'My hubby got home again and I already felt like I needed to push. We got in the car but I told him I didn't think we would make it,' she said. 'She was born at some point along the way, but she was still in her amniotic sack. 'I was fully clothed and she slipped past everything I was wearing... even my underwear. It was very bizzare.' The midwife who met them at the hospital pulled Ms Gorgens' pants down in the car and she found baby Ava. 'We couldn't hear her because she was still in her sack. I was a little scared to look because we couldn't hear crying,' she said. 'She was perfectly okay - Simon cut the cord when we were still in the car.' When it came to Sienna's birth in December 2011, the couple attempted the hospital dash again. 'Simon managed to stop on the median strip, he ran to my side and her head was already coming out,' Ms Gorgens said. 'He grabbed her and delivered her... then we rushed to the hospital again. Sienna only took 50 minutes.' Mary hasn't had pain relief in any of her five births because there hasn't been enough time . Simon has delivered the three youngest children because they couldn't make it to the hospital in time . Mila, Ava, Brody, Max and Sienna (L-R) were all born healthy despite only the eldest being born in the hospital . But the couple's fourth child was considerably quicker and they didn't even made it to the car. 'Mila was born on our bedroom floor in 10 minutes,' Ms Gorgens said. 'It was at night in March 2013 and I had just finished cooking - everything was fine. I had seen the midwife that day and she said any time now. 'I put the two girls to bed and Max was still getting ready. I started pacing in our bedroom and all of a sudden it just ramped up.' She screamed out for her husband to grab some towels and the couple had to lock themselves in their bedroom so their four-year-old son wouldn't see. 'I got on all fours and pushed.

"Britain's foreign aid budget is to be protected by law following a historic vote last night – but ministers still refused to protect funding for the armed forces. The House of Lords voted to commit future governments to spending at least 0.7 per cent of national wealth – currently around £12billion a year – on overseas development. The new law will come into force within the next few weeks, after it receives royal assent from the Queen. Legislation forcing Britain to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid is set to become law tonight . Last night Tories lined up to lambast the move, saying it is wrong for aid spending to be protected when savage cuts to defence are expected after the election. A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of the forces face redundancy over the next parliament. David Cameron has repeatedly refused to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP. The 2013/14 defence budget was £34.3billion – just over this 2 per cent target and down from £35.9billion in 2010/11, when the coalition took over. By contrast, the aid budget has soared from £8.5billion in 2010 to £11.5billion in 2013 – the year that the 0.7 per cent of gross national income was reached for the first time. When Margaret Thatcher left office, just 0.27 per cent of GNI went on aid. Legislation to set the aid target in stone was passed by the Lords despite opposition from Tory grandees including former Chancellor Lord Lawson, who has described the measure as ‘gesture politics’. Sir Gerald Howarth, the former Conservative defence minister, said aid spending should be cut to allow an increase in the defence budget – because Russia is increasing spending on arms and the Middle East is in flames. Foreign aid spending rose to more than £11billion in 2013 as ministers moved to hit the 0.7% target . ‘This is a dangerous world,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s World at One. ‘This is not a time to be cutting our defence in any case. If you ask me where you make the savings – you make them in overseas aid.’ More than 300 Tory backbenchers are expected to rebel on Thursday by forcing a Commons vote on enshrining the 2 per cent defence target in law. Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘Most of my constituents would think ensuring the safety of this country is of greater importance than meeting the overseas aid budget. ‘If the Government is prepared to accept that a percentage of gross national income should go toward a specific priority, it seems crazy that we can do this for overseas aid but not for defence. ‘We should be putting the 2 per cent Nato target into law.’ The pledge to introduce the law was part of the coalition agreement of 2010 – but opposition from many Conservative backbenchers meant it never saw the light of day as an official government bill. It had to be piloted through parliament by Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore. It was approved in the Commons earlier this year and yesterday was given an unopposed third reading in the Lords. n SACKED cabinet minister Andrew Lansley suffered fresh humiliation yesterday after being rejected for a top UN role that David Cameron is said to have promised him. The former health secretary, who was demoted two years ago after his NHS reforms ran into trouble, was tipped to become the UN aid chief. But the job has gone to fellow Tory MP Stephen O’Brien, an ex-minister who will replace Valerie Amos as under-secretary for humanitarian affairs.","House of Lords votes in favour of law which has been backed by MPs .

"A woman with astonishingly large breasts is on the prowl for a partner, and she's turned to TLC's hit reality show Strange Love to find it. Kristy Love, a 36-year-old 'adult' massage therapist based in Atlanta, Georgia, made her grand debut on last night's episode, where she announced it was time for her, and her size 48NN 'girls', to find love. 'I'm looking for true love,' she stated passionately. 'Someone who I love, and who loves me. My boobies do not need to be alone, it's time for them to find a man.' On the prowl: With her 48NN breasts, Kristy Love (pictured), a 36-year-old 'adult' massage therapist based in Atlanta, Georgia, made her grand debut on TLC's Strange Love last night . Kristy's breasts weigh a vast 15.8lbs each, and combined, tip the scales at 31.6lbs - the weight of an average toddler. On one hand, they present a hazard, particularly in the kitchen. 'Sometimes they get in the pot, sometimes they get in the pan, sometimes they get caught on the burner,' she admits. On the other hand, they are mighty useful. Kristy's cleavage is so deep that she uses it in absence of a handbag, wedging her perfume, cell phone, car keys and driving licence between her breasts. Eyes on the face please: 'I'm looking for true love,' Kristy stated passionately. 'Someone who I love, and who loves me. My boobies do not need to be alone, it's time for them to find a man' Not hiding: Although Kristy says she is on the hunt for a man who can 'redirect his focus' on her, instead of her chest, she proudly puts her enormous assets on show . Useful: On one hand, Kristy's enormous assets present a hazard, particularly in the kitchen, but on the other hand, she uses her cleavage to store important items like her cell phone and car keys . Although Kristy says she is on the hunt for a man who can 'redirect his focus' on her, instead of her chest, she proudly jiggles her enormous assets as she speaks, and shows them off in an array of low-cut blouses. Kristy used to be 'embarrassed' and 'ashamed' of her breasts, which developed when she was only eight years old, and would habitually wear multiple bras to keep them under wraps. But since she developed a career as a massage therapist, and introduced her bosoms into her very saucy repertoire, she's embraced them wholeheartedly. According to an interview with The Mirror in 2013, Kristy makes an much as $1,300 daily, treating clients to the 'Happy Man Works', which involves 'squishing' and 'smothering' them with her breasts. Some clients even enjoy 'being hit over the head' with them, or have her glide over their bodies covered in oil. 'I have to keep an eye out when I'm squashing someone,' she explained. 'I look at their feet and their fingers to make sure there is still movement there and they’re still breathing.' Change of heart: Kristy used to be 'embarrassed' and 'ashamed' of her breasts, which developed when she was only eight years old, but these days she loves them . Ignoring the risks: Kristy, pictured on a date, has been warned by doctors that her weight in general - as of 2013, she weighed 320lbs - leaves her at risk of developing high blood pressure and heart disease .

'But that doesn't run in my family so it doesn't bother me,' says. While big breasts do run in the family - her eldest sister had hers reduced from a 52NN to an H-cup - Kristy has the largest. She says her relatives are 'totally against' her massage vocation and consider it 'immoral'.

"A cannabis-smoking supporter of hate preacher Anjem Choudary has walked free from court after grooming a 15-year-old schoolgirl on Facebook. Mansoor Miah sent explicit photographs to the schoolgirl before inviting her to a hotel to have sex with him. The 22-year-old from Kilburn, north west London, even filmed himself in sordid trysts and sent them to the youngster who was using her Nintendo DS to access Facebook. He was spared jail after a court heard how Miah, who has shared several of Choudary's fundamentalist tweets, struck up an online conversation about the Koran. Mansoor Miah walked free from court after sending explicit messages to a 15-year-old schoolgirl he was grooming over social media . When she told him she was uninterested in religion Miah, who worked in Tesco, carried on their conversations which turned to a sexual nature despite the girl having told him how old she was. He was handed a suspended sentence of 16 months at Southward Crown Court today. Earlier the court heard how he began speaking to the girl about Islam but soon forced the conversation in a sexual direction. 'Having talked about Islam, undeterred, Mr Miah began to chat the complainant up,' prosecutor Stephen Requena said. 'Having talked about Islam he proceeds to chat her up, having established her real age. 'He praises her physical appearance and asks if she has a boyfriend.' The court heard how he sent her explicit photographs of himself, urging her to do the same before performing a sex act in front of her on webcam. He was arrested last year after one of the girl's teachers told her mother of their plans to meet in a Premier Inn in Kent. 'The mother, it seems, was scared and felt her daughter was in danger when this was discovered. The 22-year-old is a supporter of hate preacher Anjem Choudary having shared some of the cleric's posts on Twitter . 'She describes her daughter as not that mature, which leaves her vulnerable,' added Mr Requena. The youngster was said to have had her laptop confiscated after engaging in explicit conversations with men on social media before meeting Miah. In a statement provided by her mother she was described as 'shy' and and 'uncomfortable' with new people. Despite admitting to knowing the girl was underage, Miah claimed that he did not target her, adding: 'She looks 20.' Support: Miah is a fan of Islamist hate preacher Anjem Choudary (above) 'He didn’t seek her out, he befriended her because she was a friend of a friend, not because she looks young, she looks 20,' said hi barrister Edward Jones said. 'This was a young man confused about religious beliefs, smoking cannabis to significant degree. He has now sought to reform himself. 'He made a catastrophic error of judgement which he said would not be repeated.' Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said while the defendant had planned 'some sort of sexual activity', he was not a 'predatory paedophile'. 'You have not repeated this offence, so there is no evidence you are a predatory paedophile of the type I’m afraid we often see in this court, and the fact you didn't try again allows me to accept you were remorseful for your behaviour months before the police intervened. 'A suspended sentence is appropriate. 'A prison sentence to mark the seriousness of what you did, and a course of treatment to ensure it doesn't happen again and to protect young girls.' The judge added that if the pair had met up at the hotel or if Miah had approached another girl his sentence would have been more severe. 'The victim was just 15 and was young for her age, her mother said she was vulnerable and not streetwise. 'You had no sexual experience. You were feeling depressed and isolated, you were smoking cannabis. 'I accept you were immature for your age and once these conversations were finished you did not talk to other girls.' He also praised him for being 'helpful' to the police, who described him as a 'different person' from the one who had committed the offences. Miah was also put on the sex offenders register and made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order. .","Mansoor Miah contacted the girl over social media as she played Nintendo .

"Sacked: Elaine McHale, 57, has lost her latest £110,000-a-year job at Leicester City Council after her department failed to allocate social workers to look after hundreds of vulnerable children . A council manager who retired from her £160,000-a-year job after the deaths of four children only to take a new social services job has been sacked after a fresh scandal, MailOnline can reveal today. Elaine McHale lost her £110,000-a-year job at Leicester City Council after her team failed to allocate social workers to look after hundreds of vulnerable children. Leicester's Labour mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has said Ms McHale was sacked after her 'botched review' caused her social services department to 'fall apart', which could have put children in the city at risk. But MailOnline can reveal that she moved to Leicester despite retiring from her £159,346-a-year job (total remuneration including pension contribution) at Wakefield Borough Council in 2012 as it emerged that the deaths of four children were being investigated. One of the serious case reviews probed by child protection experts was the murder of five-year-old Haroon Bhatti by his father Pazeer Ahmed, who burnt then beat his son to death. Ms McHale announced she was retiring from her job as director for family services a day after Ahmed was jailed for life, the council said the timing was coincidental. Another of the reviews considered whether the authorities could have stopped the murder of eight-week-old  Grace Barnes, who had her skull crushed  by her father Richard  in November 2011 after getting drunk on  beer, whisky and vodka. Wakefield Council insisted Ms McHale's retirement  had been spoken about for 'some time' before the four serious case reviews were announced. But instead of retiring completely she then moved to Leicester City Council as Strategic Director Adult Social Care and Health earning between £110,000 and £115,000-a-year until her departure on Friday. Revealing her sacking, Sir Peter Soulsby said there had been a 'complete failure' to inform the council's leadership about the scandal, which meant Elaine McHale was dismissed with immediate effect. He added that her management meant 'children have potentially been put at risk and this cannot be tolerated'. Cases: Mrs McHale retired from Wakefield Council in the wake of four serious case reviews, including Pazeer Ahmed's (left) murder of his child Haroon Bhatti and Richard Barnes' murder of his baby Grace (right) Ms McHale was sacked with cabinet member Vi Dempster after the council was presented with a draft report of a recent Ofsted inspection of its social services department. Inspectors found that a poorly-managed review of front-line social workers carried out in the summer of 2014 by Ms McHale 'resulted in more than 30 leaving the authority  during which time vulnerable children were put at risk by not being allocated the social workers they needed', the council said today. Critics have today demanded an end to the 'merry-go-round' at the top of councils where staff on huge salaries are allowed to resign or retire after scandals only to quickly find a new 'cushy' job. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's bad enough when taxpayers foot the bill for enormous salaries at town halls, but it's quite another when they are paying rewards for failure. 'What really angers hard-working taxpayers, though, is when council top brass are removed from their post but find themselves in a cushy role elsewhere in the public sector. More has to be done to bring this merry-go-round to a grinding halt.' After her recent sacking Ms McHale has also been suspended as  chairman of the  Bradford Safeguarding Children Board, a role where she could charge up to £500-per-day for her services. She was offered the job last year despite concerns over whether she was as suitable appointment but was removed from her post today. A Bradford Council spokesman said: 'This morning Bradford Safeguarding Children Board (BSCB) and Bradford Council have become aware that Elaine McHale's interim contract as Director of Adult Services at Leicester City Council has been terminated. 'Following discussions with Ms McHale, it has been agreed that she will be temporarily removed, without prejudice, from her position as independent chair of the BSCB whilst enquiries are ongoing'. Ms McHale was unavailable for comment today.","Elaine McHale retired in 2012 in the wake of four serious case reviews .

"Higher earners are to benefit from the first real terms rise in the 40p tax threshold for seven years. In a surprise move, the Chancellor announced a modest ‘down payment’ on Tory plans to raise the bracket for paying higher-rate tax to £50,000. David Cameron vowed last year to end the scandal of so-called ‘fiscal drag’, which has seen millions dragged into paying 40p tax by freezing and cutting the starting threshold.] . Scroll down for video . The Chancellor used the Budget to announce a modest ‘down payment’ on Tory plans to raise bracket for paying higher-rate tax to £50,000 . It had been thought that the Liberal Democrats would veto the introduction of any rise ahead of the election. But Mr Osborne cheered Tory MPs by announcing a series of modest increases in the 40p threshold in the coming years, culminating in a 1.4 per cent rise in 2017 – just above the forecast inflation rate of 1.2 per cent. Married couples have gained from an increase in the transferrable tax allowance. The Chancellor announced that the amount a spouse can transfer to their partner is being raised by £50 – in line with the rise in the personal income tax allowance. The tax break comes into force on April 1. It was originally planned that married couples in which one person earned under the £10,500 income tax threshold would be allowed to transfer £1,050 of their allowance to their spouse. Now that the personal allowance has been raised, the Chancellor’s move means that taxpayers will be able to transfer £1,100 of their allowance to their spouse – an increase of £50. As a result, couples will be able to save around £220 a year. Labour have said they will scrap the tax break if they win the election. In his speech, George Osborne said: ‘In this Budget the rate of the new transferable tax allowance for married couples will rise to £1,100. That’s the allowance coming in just two weeks’ time to help over 4million couples – help that Labour would take away, but we on this side are proud to provide.’ It only applies to couples in which there is one basic rate taxpayer, with the other earning less than the personal allowance. The Tories said that stay-at-home parents and those who work part-time would be the biggest beneficiaries from the change. The plans mean that the income at which the higher rate is payable will rise from £41,865 to £42,385 in April 2015, £42,700 in April 2016 and £43,300 in April 2017. Treasury aides said the number of people dragged in to paying higher-rate tax would be 100,000 lower as a result. The changes in the basic rate and 40p thresholds will be included in the Finance Bill that will be pushed through the Commons in the coming days. But they could be reversed by an incoming Labour government if Ed Miliband wins power in May. Labour has been silent on 40p tax, giving no indication that it would raise the threshold. Mr Osborne also announced that, unlike in some previous years, higher-rate taxpayers will benefit in full from another planned increase in the personal allowance. The Chancellor said the allowance – the starting point for paying income tax – would rise to £11,000 by 2017, from its planned level of £10,600 next month. The changes announced yesterday are worth £80 to basic-rate taxpayers and £172 to those paying the 40p rate, and will cost the Treasury £1.6billion by 2017. Treasury sources said 27million people will receive a tax cut and 3.7million be taken out of income tax altogether as a result of the new thresholds. The decision to raise the personal allowance to £11,000 takes a big step towards Mr Cameron’s pledge to raise it to £12,500 by 2020 if the Conservatives win the election. The announcements confirm that the Conservatives will have to implement massive rises in the 40p threshold in the later years of the next parliament in order to hit Mr Cameron’s £50,000 pledge. The number of people paying 40p tax has risen by around three million to five million since 2010, as a result of coalition decisions to cut the threshold to help pay off the huge budget deficit left by Labour. Ministers initially cut the threshold for paying 40p tax and then raised it more slowly than inflation. The threshold is also the starting point at which families with a relatively high earner start to lose their child benefit payments. Many Tory MPs now want ministers to move further and faster on the issue if the party wins the election. Treasury sources described yesterday’s announcement as a ‘down payment’ on future increases, and pointed out that levels could be revised upwards at subsequent Budgets if Tories win the May 7 election. An aide to the Chancellor insisted that hitting Mr Cameron’s targets by 2020 would be ‘affordable’ in the context of the £7billion surplus which the Government is forecast to be running by the last year of the Parliament. He added: ‘We have shown during this Parliament that we are able to cut taxes and reduce the deficit at the same time.’ Zac and Suzanna Furbank are among the 27million individuals to benefit from the rise in tax-free personal allowance. From next month, workers can earn £10,600 before having to pay income tax. The limit was set to rise to £10,800 but will now be increased further to £11,000. It means lower earners like 33-year-old Mr Furbank, who makes £11,000 as a trainee public relations officer, will be lifted out of paying income tax altogether. Zac and Suzanna Furbank, pictured with their children, are among 27million individuals to benefit from rise in tax-free personal allowance . His wife, who earns £24,000 as a part-time accounts assistant, will also stand to benefit by taking home more of her salary. Mrs Furbank said: ‘This was a great Budget for us. 'The raise in personal allowance will mean I get to keep more of what I earn and it’ll mean more for my husband, who’d be lifted out of income tax completely.’ The couple are trying to save for a house while also juggling the cost of childcare for their two children, five-year-old Megan and two-year-old Oliver. They said the changes will help boost their finances. ‘It’ll give us a little bit extra in the long term,’ Mrs Furbank added. ‘Another thing that will affect us is the Isas for first-time buyers. 'The higher personal allowance will give us more money to save, and the new Isas will give us a better way of saving.’","David Cameron vowed last year to end scandal of ‘fiscal drag’, which sees millions dragged into paying 40p tax .

"A British father, his partner and two children, including a six-week-old baby, have been found stabbed to death in a suspected murder-suicide in Gilbraltar. The 31-year-old man, who is reportedly from Liverpool, and the 37-year-old Spanish woman were found dead this morning, alongside a four-year-old Spanish girl and the baby. It is understood that all four were found with stab wounds, while the woman and the girls reportedly had their necks slashed. Police officers begin investigations in Gibraltar after a British man, his Spanish partner and two young girls, including a six-week-old baby, were found stabbed to death inside a flat in an apparent murder-suicide . Police on the British enclave say they are not currently looking for any suspects in connection with the deaths . A major police investigation has been launched and detectives and forensic officers are working in the flat while the area remains cordoned off (pictured) Police on the British enclave say they are not currently looking for any suspects in connection with the deaths. The family, who have been identified by police but have not yet been named, were found in the rented flat in the Boschetti's Steps area at 11.35am. Spanish media reported that they had been living in Spain and had only arrived in Gibraltar a few days earlier. Police confirmed the man was of British nationality while the women had Spanish nationality but was originally from Cuba. Local newspapers reported that the man was from Liverpool and that the four-year-old girl was the woman's daughter from a previous relationship, while the baby girl had been born in Spain. Police were called to the scene at 11am after a member of the company which owns the property went to the flat. The person did not get any response from knocking on the door but noticed that the property was locked from the inside, police said. Spanish newspaper El Mundo quoted police sources saying the door to the flat had not been forced and the three females all had cuts to their necks. Spanish media reported they had been living in Spain and had only arrived in Gibraltar to stay in the rented flat (pictured) a few days earlier. Police said it was not clear if they were there in transit or had moved to the area . The family, who have been identified by police but have not yet been named, were found in the rented flat in the Boschetti's Steps area at 11.35am . A major police investigation has now been launched and detectives and forensic officers are working in the flat while the area remains cordoned off. Chief Minister Fabian Picardo tonight led a minute's silence at the Parliament of Gibraltar following the horrific news. He said until the police have completed their investigation, the Government can't comment any further. But he added: 'As a husband and father, I'm shocked by this terrible crime, as, I am sure, are all residents of Gibraltar. 'Gibraltarians aren't used to these types of events in our peaceful community, respectful of the law. 'Words are not enough in moments such as this and all we can do is keep the victims and their families in our thoughts and trust that justice will prevail.' The family had reportedly been living in Spain and had only recently arrived in Gibraltar to visit a family friend . Police spokesman Superintendent Richard Ullger said tonight: 'We are trying to contact close relatives and for that reason we cannot give out any names. 'But I can tell you that the man came from the United Kingdom and the woman had Spanish nationality and was of Cuban extraction. The four year old also had Spanish nationality.' He added: 'The deaths are not natural deaths and we are carrying out a major investigation lead by Acting Superintendent Wayne Tunbridge from the Serious Crime Unit. 'Police found the bodies after responding to a call from a member of the public. At the moment we are still investigating the relationship between the four people and the circumstances of their deaths. 'A Home Office pathologist and a specialist paediatric pathologist will fly out to carry out the autopsies. We are not looking for anyone else at this stage. 'We are still trying to reach some family members and won't be revealing the identities until the next of kin have been informed. We are not speculating on the cause of deaths.' Police on the British enclave on the Iberian Peninsula are not searching for any suspects in the stabbing . A spokesman for the Royal Gibraltar Police also described how the force had been alerted to the incident. They said: 'A member of staff of the company that was letting out the flat, which is a rental property, attended the residence. 'They got no answer from within but noticed that the house was locked from inside and that sent a few alarm bells ringing and they decided to call the police. 'At the moment what we are doing is trying to get as much background information from both the Spanish and the UK sides of the family.' None of the deceased are thought to have been known to police or social services in Gibraltar. The spokesman added: 'These people had only been in Gibraltar for a few days, I think it was either last Thursday or Friday that they arrived. 'We are trying to discover if they were here in transit to the UK or whether they were planning on staying for any length of time in Gibraltar.' A Home Office forensic pathologist is expected to travel to Gibraltar in the next couple of days to perform post-mortem examinations on the bodies.

"Since 2010, Mrs Cameron has worked as a creative consultant for the company two days a week . Samantha Cameron received an estimated £400,000 windfall from the sale of the luxury stationery company where she works, it was claimed last night. Smythson was bought in April 2005 by a group of prominent City figures for some £15.8million. According to a report by The Guardian last night, Mrs Cameron would have received £1,589.20 for each of her 275 shares, giving her a lump sum windfall of £437,000 before tax as a result of the sale. The company was acquired by a consortium of City grandees, including some who have donated to the Conservative Party. At the time of the sale on April 30, 2005, Mr Cameron was the Tories' head of policy coordination, a largely back office role. He was appointed shadow education secretary six days later, in the wake of the Tories' election defeat. Among those who were reportedly involved in the deal were Jonathan Green, the founder of the GLG hedge fund, Howard Shore, who set up the stockbroker group Shore Capital, and members of the Fleming banking family. All are Tory donors. Last night a spokesman for Samantha Cameron said: 'The sale of Smythson happened before the 2005 General Election, when Michael Howard was leader of the Conservative Party. 'Samantha Cameron was not a board director and was not responsible for the sale. It would be entirely wrong to suggest any wrongdoing or attempts to obtain undue influence.' Mrs Cameron began working at Smythson as a window dresser in 1996, the same year the couple married. By the time of the sale she was creative director. The Guardian also reported that Mrs Cameron will have received a second windfall when the firm was sold again in 2009 because she held shares in the new parent company, although this was estimated to be a 'much smaller sum'. It is calculated that Samantha Cameron received more than £400,000 before tax from the sale in April 2005 . Since 2010, Mrs Cameron has worked as a creative consultant for the company for two days a week. Smythson's store in central London's New Bond Street sells among its stock £2,000 python-skin handbags. Mrs Cameron is thought to earn up to £100,000 a year. Mr Green reportedly gave the Tories more than £40,000 and also financed Mr Cameron's leadership campaign. Mr Shore has given the party £34,000 personally while Shore Capital has donated more than £580,000 to the Tories, it was claimed. Last month the Mail revealed the firm is owned through a holding company based in Luxembourg, a tax haven. It is also linked to a secretive trust in the Channel Island of Guernsey, another well-known tax haven. Mr Cameron has publicly criticised tax avoidance in the past, including a warning to businesses setting up 'ever-more complex tax arrangements abroad' which he said should 'wake up and smell the coffee' – a jibe aimed at Starbucks, which has paid only small sums of tax in the UK. David Cameron himself is estimated to be worth around £3million. His house in North Kensington – which is currently being rented out – is thought to be worth around £2.7million, and he also owns a home in Oxfordshire which is worth close to £1million. And as well as their personal wealth, the Prime Minister and his wife come from very well-off backgrounds. Mr Cameron's father, Ian Cameron, was once estimated to be worth around £10million. He died in 2010 and left a fortune of £2.74million, from which Mr Cameron received £300,000. Mrs Cameron's father, Sir Reginald Sheffield, is the eighth holder of a baronetcy that goes back to 1755 and is estimated to be worth at least £20million.","Smythson was bought in April 2005 by city figures for some £15.8million .

"Holiday costs in eurozone countries are looking significantly cheaper this year. On Friday, the pound was worth €1.38 – which for British holidaymakers heading to, say, France, Spain, Italy and Greece is the most favourable rate for more than seven years. It’s around 14 per cent better than this time last year, and 20 per cent better than five years ago. Holidaymakers booking a village in the South of France can save more than £200 compared with last year . Put more graphically, if that villa in the South of France you’re looking at costs €2,000 (£1,450) a week to rent, it’s £231 cheaper than it was in 2014 and £353 cheaper than in 2010. Likewise, a meal for two in Venice with a €100 (£72) price tag costs roughly £12 less than this time last year, and £18 less than in 2010. Here are some issues that the better pound/euro exchange rate raises – but remember that if you use cards to get cash out of overseas ATMs, settle hotel and restaurant bills and make purchases, the actual exchange rate won’t be quite as good, due to the banks taking commission. Holidaymakers may get a better deal by booking direct, in euros, as most prices were fixed last year . Book direct? Most holiday companies will have fixed their prices with hoteliers and villa owners last year, when the pound was weaker against the euro. This means you may well get a better deal by booking direct, in euros. That said, I know of a number of operators and villa agencies that have recently lowered prices to take into account the better exchange rate, and tailor-made arrangements may be based on current exchange rates. So it’s worth doing DIY vs package price comparisons. Also bear in mind that you get better financial protection and back-up when you book a package. If you do book direct, to be sure of benefiting from the current good exchange rate, you need to pay in full now rather than putting down a deposit or paying on arrival/departure. The rate may be even better in a few months’ time, but of course it may have worsened. You could hedge your bets by obtaining some (but not all) of your spending money now . Buy euros now? The pound was worth about €1.40 a week ago, but by Friday it had fallen slightly. No one knows what it will do next, so if you buy euros now, you’re taking a gamble. But you could hedge your bets by obtaining some (but not all) of your spending money now. Consider doing so with a pre-paid euro currency card – the exchange rate used will be whatever it is on the day you upload the funds. The Ukash Travel Money MasterCard (ukash.com) has very competitive exchange rates and charges no fees for making purchases or cash withdrawals. A driving holiday on the Continent? The combination of more favourable exchange rates and lower oil prices means that filling up the car in eurozone countries is costing British motorists a lot less than a year ago. According to a Post Office Travel Money report, when converted into pounds, the price of a litre of unleaded petrol in France, Italy, Spain, Germany and Austria is down year-on-year by at least 20 per cent. In many European countries, fuel is also markedly cheaper than in the UK – about 10p less per litre of unleaded in France than in the UK. Prague is an attractive destination for Britons as the Czech koruna has plummeted against sterling . Beyond the eurozone . Exchange rates have also improved significantly for British travellers heading to some European countries outside the eurozone. Notoriously expensive Scandinavia is looking more affordable. Compared with this time two years ago, the Norwegian krone and Swedish krona are about 25 per cent weaker against the pound. You might also want to consider a break to Prague: the Czech koruna has plummeted over 20 per cent against sterling since spring 2013. But if you’re thinking of heading to the US this year, things are not looking so rosy. The strength of the US economy means that the pound is weaker against the dollar than at any time since June 2010. Worth a paltry $1.47 on Friday, the pound has dropped by more than ten per cent from 12 months ago – bumping up accommodation and day-to-day costs. Bear in mind that it’s not just in the States where the strong dollar is making things pricier for British visitors. The same is true in other holiday spots where currencies are pegged to the US dollar, such as Barbados, St Lucia and Antigua in the Caribbean, and Dubai.","The pound's value against the euro on Friday was strongest in seven years .

"A dilapidated home, with no functioning bathroom or kitchen has stunned Sydney's property market by selling for $1.5 million. However, just one day after the unprecedented sale, the Reserve Bank of Australia cautioned that it remains concerned that house prices may fall. The bank's Financial Stability Review, released on Wednesday, pointed out that if the rising value of properties in Sydney - fuelled by demand and investor speculation - continues, then a drop in prices could follow. Scroll down for video . A dilapidated home in Sydney's inner-west sold for $1.5 million on Wednesday . This is despite the property, built in the 1980s, having no functioning kitchen (pictured) or bathroom (below) The real estate agent recommended it to buyers with a 'discerning eye' or to a 'determined restorer/renovator not deterred by the effects of sad neglect' 'Ongoing strong speculative demand would tend to amplify the run-up in housing prices and increase the risk that prices in at least some regions might fall significantly later on,' the review stated. It added: 'Heightened investor demand can amplify the housing price cycle…and so increases the risk that prices later fall significantly; investors are more likely to engage in speculative behaviour than are owner-occupiers.' Until then, house prices continue to skyrocket in Sydney, with the million dollar sale of 23 Fairmount Street at Dulwich Hill in Sydney's inner west, shocking prospective home buyers. The three-bedroom home named 'Carisbrook', which was built in 1890 and has remained unoccupied for the last 20 years, had no trouble selling despite having a non-functioning kitchen and outside toilet, Property Observer reports. Just one day after the unprecedented sale, the Reserve Bank of Australia cautioned that it remains concerned that house prices may fall . The bank's Financial Stability Review said that if the rising value of properties in Sydney - fuelled by demand and investor speculation - continues, then a drop in prices could follow . It features three original fireplaces and chimneys on a 420 square metre block, along with cracked and stained walls, chipped paint, damaged floors and a grotesque and run-down exterior. Nonetheless, the real estate agent recommended it to buyers with a 'discerning eye' or to a 'determined restorer/renovator not deterred by the effects of sad neglect'. It comes just a few days after a 1940s fibro cottage with only an outdoor toilet at Sydney's northern beaches sold for $1,105,000. The four-bedroom home received a generous amount despite also including an original kitchen and backyard laundry. However the price of 23 Fairmount Street at Dulwich Hill remained high when it went to auction on Tuesday . This is despite it featuring cracked and stained walls, chipped paint, damaged floors and a grotesque and run-down exterior . Earlier in the week, a 1940s fibro cottage with only an outdoor toilet  sold for $1,105,000 . Future buyers may be crossing their fingers for the Reserve Bank's predicted drop to prove true, but the report warns that it could lead to negative effects for home-owners. 'The further housing prices fall in that scenario, the greater the chance that lenders would incur losses on their housing loans,' the Financial Stability Review read. It later added: 'Importantly, a future fall in housing prices would reduce wealth and dampen spending for the broader household sector, particularly for those households with significant housing debt, not just for the investors who contributed to the upswing.' The four-bedroom home was sold for a generous amount despite also including an original kitchen (pictured) and backyard laundry .

"A 17-year-old  girl shot dead her stepfather, fatally stabbed her mother and locked her three younger sisters in a room with some food before fleeing the state with her boyfriend, police said on Tuesday. Ashlee Martinson allegedly gunned down her stepfather, Thomas Ayers, in an upstairs room of their Wisconsin home on Sunday morning while her mother, Jennifer Ayers, was in the living room below. Mrs Ayers, 40, who is thought to have been with Martinson's two stepsisters, aged nine and eight, and her two-year-old half-sister at the time, reportedly ran upstairs as soon as she heard gunshots. She was followed by the eldest of Martinson's three siblings. The young girl then witnessed her older sister and her mother fighting, which resulted in the latter being stabbed to death, officials said. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Ashlee Martinson (pictured) shot dead her stepfather, fatally stabbed her mother and locked her three younger sisters in a room with some food before fleeing the state with her boyfriend, police said on Tuesday . Boyfriend: Martinson allegedly gunned down her stepfather, Thomas Ayers, at their Wisconsin home Sunday, before stabbing her mother, Jennifer. She then fled with her 22-year-old boyfriend, Ryan Sisco (pictured) Sisco (left) and Martinson (right) are escorted to their initial court hearing on Tuesday . Following the killings, Martinson reportedly told her siblings they were going to play a game. She locked the terrified girls in a room and tied the door shut so they could not leave, it is alleged. Her nine-year-old sister later told police that Martinson - who had described similar murder scenes in a blog she wrote under the pseudonym Vampchick -  had placed food and juice in the room. The suspect then fled Wisconsin with her 22-year-old boyfriend, Ryan Sisco, it is alleged. Police arrived at her family's home in Piehl, Rhinelander, after receiving a 911 call at around 10.40am. Once there, they discovered the bodies of Mr Ayer, 37, and his wife. Both were declared dead at the scene in the 1600 block of County Highway C south. Officials then found the three 'imprisoned' girls. Police subsequently launched a manhunt for Martinson and Sisco, whom they believed had left the state. The pair were arrested in Boone County, Indiana, 500 miles away, at around 7:50pm Sunday. Now, Martinson has been charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, as well as three counts of false imprisonment, for allegedly killing her parents and imprisoning her sisters.

They are both facing extradition proceedings. During an interview with police, the nine-year-old girl apparently told officers that her sister had killed their parents. She said she had heard two gunshots while Martinson and her father were upstairs. Investigators have not released a possible motive for the slayings. Following her arrest, Martinson was evaluated at a hospital for several injuries, possibly acquired during her 'fight' with her mother. None of her three siblings were injured in the homicide. It is believed that one of the girls was the 911 caller who alerted authorities to the alleged attack. However, this has not been confirmed.

The other two were Mr Ayers's  from a previous relationship, the victim's sister, Barbara Curtis, told the Mulwaukee Journal Sentinel. In Martinson's Vampchick posts, written on a blog titled Nightmare, the teenager posted short stories and poems about graphic murders, autopsies, suicides, Hell and the Devil, and even cannibalism. She also posted chilling images of flayed skulls, demons and characters such as the Slender Man. In one poem, called Insanity Love, the teenager wrote: 'They say one of us is to blame, You’re holding that knife, covered in blood, I’m laughing off the pain, Wondering which one of us is guilty, If we’re both totally insane?' And only last week, she spoke of murder in a short story, titled Unworthy. Disturbing: Martinson had described similar murder scenes in a blog she wrote, titled Nightmare (pictured) Recounting murder: In her blog posts, written under the pseudonym Vampchick, the teen posted short stories (pictured) and poems about graphic murders, autopsies, suicides, Hell and the Devil, and even cannibalism . Love and murder: These pictures show extracts from two of Martinson's poems on her Nightmare blog . In it, she wrote: 'Rushing through the woods late at night. Deep into the darkest corner where the agonizing screams can not be heard. Walking into a small cabin. Marveling at the sweet horrors of blood that I thirst for. I then take the next victim who is unconscious. I tightly bind them to a low table. 'Awaiting them to wake once more. I clean the dry blood off my tools from a previous session. The last body has been disposed of just hours before, yet I have not been satisfied with the pain, agony and blood. I bend down as they start to wake. ""Welcome to hell."" I whisper in her ear.' One particularly disturbing image on the blog is a drawing of a monster, which Martison has named 'The Beast Within'. The teenager wrote: 'The beast is a fearful creature that lives within us all, and if you’re not careful, the beast will consume you whole, leaving you alone in your own miserable hell.' Mr and Mrs Ayers had been married for around a year when they were  killed on Sunday, according to Ms Curtis. A future court date for Martinson has not yet been arranged, WSAW reported.

(Infinity Love, January 2015) One look, one look is all it took, For obsession to begin, Making you want to kill yourself, To him, killing is no sin, Brutally snatches mortals at night, They scream, they flail, But he takes off in flight, To him you can’t be faithful, He is a fallen angel.' (Angels In The Mirrors, January 2015) 'Bloodstains in my fingerprints, Screams inside my head, Memories of imagination, I’m dancing with the dead, Whispers in the shadows, Death waits upon the eve, I’ve come to love the darkness, The night is when I feed.' (My Shadow, January 2015) 'I’m sitting in this empty room all alone, I can hear nothing, but their screaming souls, Souls of madness but, not like me, I can see their innocence, Unlike the monster I am, That no one can see, And what I have become, What I have done to some, Someone like me, That no one can see, A psychopath in the dark, My mind is full of twisted things, But my eyes are full of sparkles, Hoping that these walls will fall apart, So that my killing can start.' (Murder Maddness, January 2015) 'Rushing through the woods late at night. Deep into the darkest corner where the agonizing screams can not be heard. Walking into a small cabin.

Make someone feel how I do. The river is beautiful, my gun is loaded, my tools are cleaned, and my toy is all tied up and ready.

"A natural reaction for a mother is to want to alleviate their child's pain but just two doses of a mainstream painkiller saw a seven month old baby almost lose her short life. Jen Shaw, from Toowoomba, about 120km west of Brisbane in Queensland, is no stranger to motherhood, having had six children in 13 years. However, nothing could have prepared her for the emotions she experienced over her youngest child in the past few weeks. What started out at as a head cold quickly left doctors completely baffled as precious little Chasely rapidly deteriorated with her skin burning, swelling and blistering so much that she became unidentifiable to her mother. Scroll down for video . Jen Shaw (left) with her daughter Chasley (right) who had a dangerous reaction to taking two doses of Nurofen . What started out at as a head cold quickly left doctors completely baffled as precious little Chasely rapidly deteriorated with her skin burning, swelling and blistering . Chasely was checked over by a GP on Monday February 25 and confirmed Ms Shaw's suspicions that her daughter was just suffering from a cold: 'a mild cough, a runny nose and a case of “baby grumpys” but otherwise fine.' Ms Shaw, a whole food chef who blogs on health and wellbeing, gave Chasely two doses of Nurofen on Tuesday February 26 as she was miserable after battling the head cold for the past week. This was the first time that the seven-month-old had ever taken any medication before but Ms Shaw thought nothing of it as all of her other five children had taken Nurofen in the past. 'She seemed a bit better after the first dose and seemed a bit more content but after the second dose she was very cranky and irritable,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Not what you would expect from a child who has just been given pain relief.' Ms Shaw immediately had a gut feeling that her little girl has reacted to the medication and read the back of the bottle for potential side effects. 'I remember scouring the Nurofen bottle for a list of symptoms that might signal an allergic reaction, but couldn't find much at all,' she said. 'If I can tell you one thing that has become solidified from this whole experience it is trusting your mama gut.' The nasty blister on her ear (left) and her precious skin shedding off all over her body (right) The seven-month old became unidentifiable to her own mother who was told by doctors to expect the worst . Casely needed to be given the powerful painkiller Endone to ease her excruciating pain . After a very restless night with her unhappy little one - Ms Shaw knew they had to go to the hospital. 'She was waking up every 15 minutes squealing in pain, fists clenched, balling over and clamping down every time I would try to feed her,' 'By the time we got to the emergency room she had a red ring around her eyes, nose and mouth, her neck also was red and had what I thought was bad nappy rash.' After several tests including an ultrasound they were sent home with a diagnosis of a viral infection. But the next morning, Chasely had several nasty blisters on her face and neck, and a very painful one on her ear which was weeping, her nappy rash had become even worse and she had become pale and very ill. They went back to the hospital, where anxieties were even further heightened when the doctors had no idea what was wrong with poor Chasely. 'The day in emergency was quite scary, I remember reading the faces of the staff and seeing worry, but more than anything seeing confusion,' she said. 'A kind of look that they had no idea what was going on with my baby girl.' 'I hugged her, I whispered in her ear that I needed her to fight on,' Ms Shaw said to her sick little girl . Finally a specialist paediatric doctor suggested it may have been an extremely rare condition called Steven Johnson’s syndrome - a potentially deadly skin disease that usually results from a drug reaction. 'Doctors came from all around that afternoon to see Chasely and her skin, it terrified me that all these doctors had never seen anything like it before,' she said. 'I mean how could they fix her if they didn't even know what it was?' Chasely was treated with a high dose antibiotics and Panadol for her excruciating pain. 'Through Thursday night she was checked almost hourly, her entire skin was red and hot, she was in such agony and squealed in so much pain. 'She wouldn't sleep away from my arms and even the slightest movement could hurt her.' When Ms Shaw woke on Friday morning, she said she couldn't even recognise her own baby. 'A doctor told me to prepare for the worst, that my baby girl was extremely sick and extremely fragile. 'My heart completely shattered - I thought we would lose her.' It was at this point that Ms Shaw broke down unable to comprehend a life without her  beautiful little girl. 'Once I got baby Chasely to sleep, I escaped to the bathroom and sobbed,' she said. 'I didn't know how to fix this, what do I do next? I could only give myself over to the hospital, and to a higher power.' But Ms Shaw decided they were not giving up without a fight. 'I returned and I hugged her, I whispered in her ear that I needed her to fight on, just fight this off and we will go home. I gave her all my energy and all my love,' she said. Ms Shaw cried when she saw Chasely catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing . By Monday Chasely's fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself . Numbing gel was used in Chasely's mouth so she could continue feeding and breast milk was used on her wounds along with lukewarm baths with paraffin and later with paw paw. The pain was so bad that she had to be given Endone which Ms Shaw said was extremely frightening as it's such a heavy duty pain killer but knew she had no choice. Finally, by Saturday afternoon, Chasely started to improve - she was able lay on a bed and look around. 'My sister and eldest daughter came to visit and danced for her with toys, and though she couldn't smile and laugh I could see she was amused,' she said. The following day,  her swelling started to go down and parts of her body that had blistered first started to heal and Ms Shaw began to recognise her little girl again. By Monday her fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself. 'I cried when I saw her catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing.' Chasely was released from hospital on Tuesday where her skin could be treated at home. Almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed Chasely of her young life, you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl. 'We are absolutely blessed - it puts everything into perspective and everything else just drops away - nothing else in the world matters.' Almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed Chasely of her young life, you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl . She doesn't know how she could have gone on if Chasely didn't courageously bounce back from such a debilitating state. 'I'm not sure I would have coped very well - I can't imagine going through what some parents have,' she said. Chasely must now avoid all steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Ms Shaw says that they still have a long journey ahead to learn more about her daughter's condition. But she insists she feels no animosity towards Nurofen. 'I'm not waging a war on pharmaceutical companies - I just want to educate and empower people on what can happen,' she said. 'But there is a list of 300 different medications, antibiotics and even vitamins that she can never have so there a lot more to learn on our journey.' 'Nurofen is very sorry to hear about Chasely Shaw’s condition and are glad to hear she is recovering. We take the health of our customers very seriously. Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is an extremely rare but known reaction to a multitude of triggers such as infections, medications or illness. The exact cause for the reaction is currently unknown and the reaction is unpredictable . Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), a group of medicines that includes ibuprofen, have also been associated with rare cases of SJS, there is no confirmed causal link . Allergic skin reactions of this type are extremely rare. Based on our adverse event collection data, the incidence of SJS is 1 case per 100 million packs sold. All Nurofen for Children packs include warnings for consumers to stop taking and see a healthcare professional immediately if an allergic reaction occurs.' 'We are absolutely blessed - it puts everything into perspective and everything else just drops away - nothing else in the world matters,' Ms Shaw said .","Chasely Shaw had an extreme adverse reaction to two doses Nurofen .

"Church treasurer Jill Gover (pictured) killed herself days after being confronted about  missing funds . A church treasurer who stole more than £140,000 from organisations she volunteered for after amassing huge debts killed herself after being confronted over the thefts. Jill Gover, 54, from Wool, in Dorset, was a respected and trusted member of her local community, serving as a church warden, book keeper for the village hall and trustee of a wealthy colleague's trust fund. But she racked up debts of £225,000 which included a £112,000 mortgage on a Grade II listed country cottage, £38,000 for two BMW cars, three bank loans of £50,000, five maxed-out credit cards totalling £21,000 and a £5,700 clothing catalogue bill. She kept the debts and subsequent thefts hidden from her husband Martin. Mr Gover said he was 'lost for words' after hearing the full extent of his wife's duplicity at her inquest. The inquest heard Mrs Gover siphoned off £50,466 from the coffers of  Holy Rood Church, in Wool, over a number of years. As treasurer she made numerous church cheques out to herself after forging the second signatory. But her deceit started to unravel after a cheque of £20,000 from the church to the Diocese of Salisbury bounced due to a lack of funds in its bank account. Two days before her death last year Mrs Gover was called to a meeting with vicar Rhona Floate to discuss the discrepancies. On March 31 Mrs Gover's body was found by her husband in the woodshed on the grounds of their home in the hamlet of Moreton. Detective Constable Richard Evans from Weymouth CID then investigated Mrs Gover's finances which revealed the full extent of the thefts. The inquest heard Mrs Gover siphoned off £50,466 from the coffers of Holy Rood Church (pictured) He told the inquest she had been misappropriating church funds since 2008, had not presented financial statements to an independent auditor since 2009 and had forged the audit reports to the diocese to cover up her thefts. His inquiries found Mrs Gover had also stolen at least £3,000 from the accounts of East Burton village hall in Wool which she was the treasurer of between January 2013 and March 2014. Mrs Gover had also stolen £91,200 from the recipients of a trust fund she had been a book keeper for. DC Evans told the inquest he discovered she wrote several fraudulent letters to Scottish Widows requesting sums from the trust account - five separate payments of between £5,000 and £30,000 over a seven-month period in 2012 to 2013 and then a final withdrawal of £1,200 in July 2013. Two days before her death last year Mrs Gover was called to a meeting with vicar Rhona Floate (pictured) to discuss the discrepancies . Mrs Gover had also agreed to a loan from the trust of £150,000 in 2010, which she said she would pay back over a ten-year period - but the hearing was told the majority of this remained unpaid. Mr Gover said he was shocked at the information revealed at the inquest. He said: 'I was completely unaware of what was going on. There's  bits and pieces we have been told today that have shocked me immensely. I'm lost for words. 'She was a wonderful, caring person. She was always there for people but sometimes she carried her life on her shoulders because she spent so much time doing things for others.' In an interview with the police Mr Gover suggested that some of the money may have been used to prop up a hardware shop the couple ran which had been struggling. Mr Gover also told officers that Mrs Gover was not depressed and her suicide was completely out of character. He said he could only surmise that the financial situation got on top of her. A month before her death Mrs Gover had consolidated her debts by arranging with a company to pay off £74,000 through monthly payments. Her brother Robert Ewan said: 'She was a caring and loving sister, a friend to my wife and a doting aunt to my three children. 'After the death of our mother Jill took on the role of family matriarch and provided a home for our father in his old age at her house in Dorset.' Deputy coroner Brendan Allen said although there was no suicide note he believed Mrs Gover intended to kill herself and recorded a verdict of suicide at the Bournemouth inquest. Mr Allen said: 'Mrs Gover was a book-keeper for a number of different organisations and a trustee of a trust and seems to have used her roles to misappropriate funds. 'She was in significant debt and with what happened the preceding weekend and the bounced cheque becoming apparent on March 31, I take the view she intended to end her own life.' Mrs Gover racked up debts of £225,000 which included a £112,000 mortgage on this Grade II listed cottage . The Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Revd Nicholas Holtam, expressed his condolences to the family and urged anyone in a difficult financial situation to seek help. He said: 'On behalf of the diocese, I express my deepest condolences to Martin and all of Jill's family and friends. 'Now that the inquest has established the facts, I hope this grants people some measure of closure and allows the healing process to begin. 'I urge people to seek help if they are in a difficult situation, no matter how desperate it seems, no matter how much they feel they may have contributed to it. 'The first step to solving any problem is to talk to someone. There are always options and alternatives.' A memorial service for Mrs Gover was held at Holy Rood Curch three weeks after her death with donations going to the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon. Police found Mrs Gover had also stolen at least £3,000 from the accounts of East Burton village hall (pictured)","Jill Gover, 54, stole £140,000 from her church, village hall and a trust fund .

Defense Secretary Ash Carter, center, claims he wasn't irritated last month when Vice President Joe Biden groped his wife Stephanie's shoulders at his swearing in ceremony . The NBC interview with Today's Savannah Guthrie followed Carter on a plane back to his alma mater, Abington Senior High in Abington, Pennsylvania, and covered a range of serious, and in the case of Biden, light-hearted issues that have arisen during his first six weeks on the job at the Pentagon . 'Joe rubs my shoulders, too,' the president said earlier this month during the Gridiron Clubs annual dinner, which traditionally features politicians roasting each other and their colleagues. The awkward moment has become fodder for Biden's opponents as well, with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus telling a gathering of conservative activists that the gaffe-prone vice president shouldn't be elevated to the Oval Office because he 'can't control his mouth - or his hands.' Carter chuckled as Guthrie asked him in the Monday interview about Biden's shoulder groping moment as they walked the halls of his alma mater, where he was to give a speech on the future of the military later that day. The NBC interview followed Carter on a plane back to his Pennsylvania high school, Abington Senior High, and covered a range of serious, and in the case of Biden, light-hearted issues that have arisen during his first six weeks on the job as defense secretary. Carter backed the president's stance toward Iran, which has until today to make a deal with an international coalition of countries before the White House pursues other, less diplomatic options. 'If there is a good agreement to have, obviously it's worth waiting for and completing the negotiations,' Carter told Gurthrie. When it comes to the war against ISIS in Iraq, the president's chief military strategist said it's 'too early to say' we're winning. But 'I'm confident we will win,' he added.

After a months-long review of Bergdhal's disappearance, the Army announced last week that it would charge the Afghanistan veteran with desertion, a crime that could lead to jail time. 'I really don't want to get into that,' Carter told Guthrie, citing the ongoing investigation. 'We do have a principle that we bend over backward in favor of trying to return an American service member.' While he publicly supports the president's position on major foreign policy and national security issues, Carter insisted that he's more than a yes man. 'I never think about whether he's going to like what I say. I only think about whether what I'm saying to him makes sense,' Carter said, admitting that there's been at least one time already where they did not see eye to eye.","'Oh, I laughed.

The ladies and gents public loos in Charlestown – the historic harbour location where BBC blockbuster Sunday drama Poldark was filmed – smashed the auction guide price of between £75,000 and £95,000.

"A Sydney pastor has spoken about the incredible moment Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan offered a vital piece of himself in a bid to save the man's life. Mal Feebrey, a men's mental health ambassador, had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010, when the death row inmate, with whom he had formed a close friendship, offered his own liver up for transplant. Chan, who had been in jail for five years at the time, 'knocked' the Assemblies of God minister about when he heard of his friends plight and immediately said, 'have mine'. Scroll down for video . Mal Feebrey (above left), a men's mental health ambassador, had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010, when Bali Nine kingpin Andrew Chan (above right), with whom he had formed a close friendship, offered his own liver up for transplant . 'It really touched me. Here I am waiting for a donor, I'm dying in front of my wife and kids and here he is going ""my liver's ok, you can have mine"",' Mr Feebrey told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'He was sort of like, if they want to kill me, then you can have my liver. It wasn't a passing-the-time comment, he wanted to make it happen. If he could have pulled it off he would have,' he said. Chan reportedly began making enquiries about whether the organ donation could go ahead, determined to save Mr Feebrey, who shared his Christian faith and had been a regular visitor since his incarceration in 2005. While Mr Feebrey received a liver from another organ donor, he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his 'incredible' friend. Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran are currently being held on Nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency. Mr Feebrey said that when Chan heard the news that his appeal for clemency from Indonesian President Joko Widodo, he was more concerned with the health of a fellow inmate who was in the jail's clinic than himself. 'It was a bit surreal. Andrew took it on the chin and with courage and then he just walked off to go to the clinic to go and see this guy,' Mr Feebrey said . While Mr Feebrey received a liver from another organ donor, he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his 'incredible' friend . The pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two Australians . Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran are currently being held on Nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency . Mr Feebrey has continued to be in regular contact with Chan, and is an outspoken advocate for the 'I Stand For Mercy Campaign'. The pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two Australians, and posted on his Instagram account after the Chan heard of his rejected Clemency appeal. 'Just spent the last half an hour with my friend Andrew Chan, when the Australian Consulate Staff notified him that his final appeal against [the] death sentence was rejected,' Mr Feebrey posted. 'He took it on the chin with courage, humility and with a contrite heart.' In February, the pastor posted a 'message of hope' to supporters of Chan on his Instagram account. 'The most beautiful people that I've known are those that have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss and yet found a way out of these depths,' he posted underneath a photograph of himself with Chan. In February, the pastor posted a 'message of hope' to supporters of Chan on his Instagram account . The men's mental health ambassador said it would be tragic for Chan and Sukumaran, who have worked tirelessly to mentor other prisoners, to be executed. 'Andrew is the idyllic, dream guy to mentor and rehabilitate and a great seed like him – they want to put to death?,' Mr Feebrey asked. Both Chan and Sukumaran have been involved in running education and drug rehabilitation programs inside Kerobokan prison since 2009. New footage has emerged of Sukumaran, shot as a part of a documentary in May last year, of Sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected. 'I think I can do a lot of good on the outside if I ever got free. It's not like I'm just going to go back after all this and just sit and be somewhere,' reported 9news. 'I would want to do stuff like work and make good stuff and help people,' he told Norwegian educator Ivar Schou, who met the Australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison. Sukumaran, who now faces the death penalty along with fellow inmate Andrew Chan, said that he believed he had done wrong but that he felt his punishment was too harsh. 'I accept what I did was wrong and I think I should be punished for it,' he said. The pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals . Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right, will be put through an 'assimilation' process as they prepare to face the firing squad . 'But I do think the death penalty is too excessive.' Sukumaran was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years, along with Chan. Sukumaran describes the immense change that he has seen in his life over the past ten years, most notably when he and other inmates were allowed to start education. 'In 2009 they finally gave us permission to start working and doing some projects. Slowly slowly it helped me with my life. It kept me busy. It helped me be productive. I started learning and I was able to help other people learning.' Earlier on Saturday the Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo said that the pair could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals. President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores . Mr Sukumaran was a highly respected art teacher while he was detained in Kerobokan prison . Mr Praseyto said the execution of the Bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row. This could delay the pair's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions. Ms Bishop is yet to receive a response.","Pastor Mal Feebrey discovered he had terminal liver disease in 2010 .

"A Missouri woman who authorities said schemed with her ex-husband to defraud hundreds of thousands of dollars from insurers with house fires pleaded guilty for her role in a 2001 blaze that killed the couple's 15-year-old son. Sandra Kay Bryant, 59, pleaded guilty in federal court on Thursday in St. Louis to one felony count of aiding and abetting the use of fire to commit mail fraud. Bryant could be sentenced to up to ten years in prison in June. Sandra Kay Bryant, 59, pleaded guilty in federal court on Thursday in St. Louis for her role in a 2001 blaze that killed the couple's 15-year-old son. She admitted to one felony count of aiding and abetting the use of fire to commit mail fraud . Her ex-husband, Steven Kemper, pleaded guilty to the same charge in 2013 and will be sentenced next month. Investigators said the fire at the family's home in the St. Louis suburb of Florissant killed Zachariah Kemper after he became trapped in the basement he shared with his mother while her mother, Kemper and his lover lived upstairs. All of the adults escaped unharmed. According to prosecutors, Bryant set fire to a trash can in a basement utility room next to her son's bedroom, using hairspray to fuel the flames. Zachariah Kemper, 15, was killed during a fire his parents allegedly set in 2001 to commit mail fraud . The fire was supposed to look like the result of careless smoking and bad cleaning habits, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Bryant and Kemper knew their son was asleep in the next room, the indictment alleges. Firefighters found the boy's body near his bed. His arms were covering his head and face, and a fire extinguisher was on the floor, a few feet away. The teen sustained burns on his upper body, head and extremities, according to an autopsy that found soot in his airway, showing he was alive when the fire broke out. Bryant was initially charged in state court with an arson-related murder count, but she walked free after a judge declared a mistrial, barring Missouri prosecutors from going after her again. The judge in her original case, David Lee Vincent III allowed jurors to see video footage of Bryant's polygraph test but later changed his mind, triggering the mistrial. The federal indictment characterized the couple as greedy, cash-strapped schemers who once tried to torch the Alton, Illinois, home of Bryant's mother after secretly siphoning $30,000 from her bank accounts. Betty Bryant, who the indictment said also managed to escape a New Year's Day 1997 blaze authorities say Kemper had set in her St. Louis home as she slept, later denied the couple any more financial help while threatening to cut them out of her will. She died in 2007. Kemper and Bryant divorced in 2002.","Sandra Kay Bryant, pleaded guilty on Thursday in a St. Louis federal court .

"A new Washington, D.C. abortion clinic will have a 'spa-like feel', with fluffy robes, natural wood floors and tea on arrival, in an attempt to help destigmatize the procedure. Carafem, which opens this week, has a no-frills attitude when it comes to informing people with what they provide. One of their advertisement's reads, 'Abortion: Yeah, we do that'. Christopher Purdy, the clinic's president and founder, said he was inspired to start Carafem after working more than a decade promoting family planning and HIV prevention in developing countries. Carafem president and founder Christopher Purdy (pictured with health services vice president Melissa S. Grant) has begun a new Washington, D.C. abortion clinic that presents itself with a 'spa-like feel' It was there he realized how much easier it was to get an abortion, sometimes as simple as walking into a pharmacy, in places such as Ethiopia. Meanwhile, in the United States more than 200 laws have restricted the controversial procedure and forced dozens of clinics to close their doors, according to the Washington Post. Melissa S. Grant, Carafem's health services vice president, said  it was important for the clinic 'to try and present an upgrade, almost spa-like feel'. The clinic will also only provide pharmaceutical abortions, meaning there will be no vacuum aspiration or surgical procedures available - this means that Carafem's clients cannot be more than 10 weeks pregnant. Purdy told the Washington Post that not purchasing surgical equipment allows him to charge $400 for the procedure, which is about $100 less than the average pharmaceutical abortion. The clinic offers fluffy robes, natural wood floors and tea on arrival, in an attempt to help destigmatize the procedure . Clients who walk into Carafem will receive counseling and go through 'basic tests' before they take the initial pill at the clinic. The whole appointment is supposed to take about 60 minutes. The second set of pills, which induces the abortion, is then taken at home the next day. On it's website, Carafem says it's staff provides 'clear, non-judgmental and accurate information so you feel confident'. 'We are an experienced team with years of experience in abortion care,' it states. Purdy said the clinic plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically. 'We don't walk to talk in hushed tones,' he said. 'We use the A-word.' Anti-abortion activists don't believe Carafem's bold take is going to work. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of anti-abortion lobbying group the Susan B. Anthony List, believes the approach is too celebratory. She said she believes even people who are pro-choice think of the procedure as 'a necessary evil'. National Right to Life President Carol Tobias believes people will find Carafem disgusting. 'Abortion is not pleasant, and trying to put pretty wrappings around the procedure isn't going to make any difference,' she said. Purdy said the clinic, which he described as 'fresh, modern, clean and caring', plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically. 'We don't walk to talk in hushed tones,' he said. 'We use the A-word' Carafem's founders aren't the only people speaking publicly and positively about abortion. A number of female Democratic lawmakers have shared their personal experiences to put a human face on the procedure and protest anti-abortion legislation. Last week Ohio Democrat Rep. Teresa Fedor revealed during a debate in the House that she had terminated a pregnancy after being raped while serving in the military and became pregnant. 'You don't respect my reason, my rape, my abortion,' she said as representatives debated the state's Heartbeat Bill, which would make it a felony for doctors to provide abortions if a fetal heartbeat is detected. 'I guarantee you there are other woman who should stand up with me and be courageous enough to speak that voice,' she continued. 'I've sat here long enough.'","Carafem is a new abortion clinic opening this week in Washington, D.C.

"The celebrity hairstylist behind Karlie Kloss' trademark bob has found himself in the midst of a financial scandal after reports emerged that it was alleged tax delinquency which led to the closure of his high-end namesake salon at New York City's Sherry-Netherland hotel last January. Garren, who goes by his first name only, has trimmed the tresses of hundreds of celebrity clients; earlier this year, he styled Karlie and Taylor Swift's hair for the March cover of Vogue, and worked backstage at New York Fashion Week working with the likes of Gigi Hadid and Anna Ewers. However, despite achieving something of a celebrity status among his fans, the stylist is believed to $504,387.42 in back taxes, according to  Page Six, and is also thought to owe several of his former employees several months’ worth of wages. Close client: Garren posed backstage with Karlie Kloss at the Anna Sui fall 2013 show. The legendary hairstylist is responsible for giving the model her trademark bob . Selfie time: Garren and the 22-year-old model took a minute to take a snapshot during New York Fashion Week in 2014 . Other former stylists who worked at his salon claim that they were never informed the business would be shutting down for good, and were left without any information after simply being told not to come into work. One staffer told Page Six that Garren even claimed the salon was closed on New Year's Day because of 'electrical problems'. Although many of his former employees are angry over the surprise closure, the legendary hairstylist remains popular with high-powered Manhattanites, who are now requesting him to make house calls. 'No matter what happens, no one is going to take away his one thousand Vogue covers,' a staffer told the publication. Day of primping: One of Garren's clients can be seen reading a magazine at his former New York City salon, which suddenly shuttered last January . Sleek design: Garren's former employees sat behind the counter at his namesake salon . The source continued: 'There are clients that said: ""I would never see him again"" [but] who now hire him to cut their hair in their kitchens. They are just so happy to have him [doing house calls].' And even though the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance reports that Garren owes a half a million dollars as of February 18, 2015, his talent is still in high demand. Garren, who has yet to comment about the allegations, is reportedly going to be featured in upcoming W magazine’s May issue. When the news of his salon's closure first broke last January, a spokesperson for his hair care product line told Page Six that he had closed the shop because he had plans to expand his product line and that he also had plans to open a salon in Miami in 2016. Dynamic duo: Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss had their hair styled by Garren for this March cover of Vogue . Iconic star: Garren styled Madonna's hair for the cover of her latest album Rebel Heart . And while the reason he closed the doors of his salon remain unknown, the demise of his business hasn’t prevented the stylist from working on the luscious locks of many A-list stars in the past few months. In addition to Karlie and Taylor's Vogue cover, Garren has also done Madonna's hair for her Rebel Heart album cover, Kendall Jenner's spread in Vogue and Gigi Hadid's hair at the Anna Sui fall/winter 2015 show during New York Fashion Week. Garren, who launched his career and in the 1970s, had a salon in Henri Bendel before he moved to his most recent Sherry-Netherland location. He also co-founded the hair-care line R+Co with fellow hairstylists Thom Priano and Howard McLaren. Blonde ambition: Gigi Hadid can be seen walking the runway at Anna Sui's fall/winter 2015 show after Garren did her hair during New York Fashion Week .

It has emerged the star, seen leaving his home today, has been scheduled to record the show in May - despite currently being the subject of an internal investigation . Wearing a black leather jacket and a white sports shirt, the suspended presenter of BBC's Top Gear wound down the window of his black Mercedes as he drove off . He said: 'As far as I'm concerned he is hosting Have I Got News for You, the BBC has not told me what to do yet and it will be an interesting conversation'. He joked: 'Maybe we will get the producer on so he can hit Jeremy Clarkson live on television.'

Clarkson has been one of Have I Got News For You’s most popular and regular guest presenters . Clarkson's contract runs out in March, and it is not clear whether it will be renewed, or whether Clarkson himself will opt to leave the BBC amid rumours that he could move to ITV in a lucrative deal .

Clarkson's contract runs out in March, and it is not clear whether it will be renewed, or whether Clarkson himself will opt to leave the BBC amid rumours that he could move to ITV in a lucrative deal.

The news comes as the racing driver who was the first Stig on Top Gear has said that the BBC show would lose its 'fire' without the embattled Clarkson. Perry McCarthy, who was the show's resident racing driver between 2002 to 2003, said that Top Gear without Clarkson simply 'won't work'. He said: 'I think you're going to have a diluted product. 'I don't think it will have the value that it did, here and overseas.' 'And God help any soul who takes his place, because that's like signing up for your own firing squad.

Targeted: Oklahoma State University student Parker Rice (left) was bombarded with hate messages and threats from people believing he was the 19-year-old at the heart of the racism scandals at rivals OU (right) Denial: The student was forced to write a message on Facbook telling hos friends he was not the man in the shocking video . The wrongly-directed messages included accusations he was a liar, another that he was pathetic while one user wished he would get run over. The other Parker Rice, 19, was expelled from the institution after he was caught singing: 'There will never be a N**** in SAE' in a sickening video that has shocked the nation. The privately-educated Catholic schoolboy from Dallas was identified as one of the conductors leading the songs on a bus on Saturday alongside 20-year-old Levi Petit. The innocent Rice, who is studying towards his elementary Japanese exams, told KERA News he sees the funny side of what has happened, but admitted it had still been stressful. 'Initially, it was kind of scary, to not know what I did to bring all of this hate to myself, ' he told the station. 'It's definitely been stressful. But I guess I take a lighter view of the comments, and be happy it's not directed at me. Links: The innocent Rice (left) was wrongly targeted with the other Rice, a privately-educated Catholic schoolboy from Dallas was identified as one of the conductors leading racist chants on a bus . He added: 'I do think it's wrong. And it shouldn't be happening. And from the looks of it, we have a lot of work to do, if as a community we want to change that.' He also wrote a message on Facebook saying: 'I would like everyone to know that I'm not the Parker Rice who allegedly was in the racist video from the OU SAE incident this past weekend. I am a student at Oklahoma State University and have never had any involvement with this fraternity. 'My Instagram, Twitter and Facebook profiles have been linked across the internet in relation to this incident. I would appreciate it if people would stop posting slanderous and hateful messages on my pages. In the wake of his identification, the guilty Rice apologized and stated he had quit the university. Even though other reports suggested he had been expelled. He wrote: 'I am deeply sorry for what I did Saturday night. It was wrong and reckless. I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same.' 'On Monday, I withdrew from the university... I admit it likely was fueled by alcohol consumed at the house before the bus trip, but that’s not an excuse. Response: The innocent Rice, who is currently studying towards his elementary Japanese exams, admitted he sees the funny side of what has happened, but admitted it had still been stressful . 'Yes, the song was taught to us, but that too doesn’t work as an explanation... For me, this is a devastating lesson and I am seeking guidance on how I can learn from this and make sure it never happens again.' His family have since been forced to flee their home after protesters gathered outside and began chanting: 'Racism is taught'. In response to the chant, which a whole busload of students joined in with, SAE's national leadership closed the fraternity. Rice is featured the most prominently in the video, as he pumps his fist and encourages others aboard the chartered bus to sing along with the lyrics: 'There will never be a n***** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me. There will never be a n***** SAE.' The video, taken aboard a party bus Saturday night en route from the campus in Norman to the Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club, caused immediate outrage on Sunday when it was posed on social media. University officials responded by banning the fraternity from campus and demanding that members move out by midnight on Monday.","The innocent Parker Rice attends Oklahoma State University .

Cousins, 36, who has a history of substance abuse, has made headlines several times in the past fortnight after a string of alleged incidents . She was fined in the Perth Magistrate's Court on Wednesday and was ordered to pay costs of $150.80. Back in 2011 Cousins gushed about his happiness with Tinecheff after the birth of their son Bobby. He said the birth of his child was the most important moment of his life. 'Not to take anything away from my footy, but there is just no comparison,' Cousins told New Idea. 'This is it - this is what it's all about. I still can't believe we're so blessed to have such a perfect little boy.' He described the birth as 'life-changing' and told of his hopes to get married. 'The love you feel, it's so innocent and infinite, and completely unconditional,' he said.

Ben Cousins and former partner Maylea Tinecheff pictured on a New Idea magazine cover in 2011 . The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. The priest tried to confront Cousins before he took off again and stopped a few metres ahead to take photos of the temple. 'Again, I tried to talk to him and he started his car,' Mr Singh said. 'I called the police and then I followed him again and he stopped his car in the middle of the road and then some cars almost hit him.' Mr Singh then became alarmed by the behaviour and left it to the police. 'He was not looking stable.' Footage emerged this week showing Cousins running through the streets away from police . Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth on Monday . Footage emerged showing the fallen AFL star running through the streets away from police, before he was taken into custody for the third time in two weeks. Cousins can be seen stopping and starting his car with its door flung wide open near the Sikh temple, before he is filmed sprinting away from the officers. No charges had been laid over those two incidents and inquiries are continuing, police say. Cousins entered rehab for 'substance abuse' in 2007 and was later suspended from the AFL for one year for bringing the game into disrepute . Cousins returned to the game with Richmond in 2009, before he retired at the end of the 2010 season. He is scheduled to appear in Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8.

"It's not Economics for Dummies, but it's not that far off. The Bank of England is widely believed to be home to many of the sharpest mathematical and financial minds in the country. And central to their work is the impressive library where millions of pages of complex theory, analysis and research gathered over the three hundred-odd years of the Bank's existence are kept. So it may come as a surprise to learn that the most popular book in the Bank's library is not a work by Keynes, Smith or  Hayek but a basic economics textbook aimed at AS and A-level students. With its 'easy-to-use' structure and full colour illustrations, Alain Anderton's Economics has long-been a favourite of youngsters hoping to get a grip on basic economic theory. Now in its fifth edition, which was published in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, a freedom of information request found the book had been issued and renewed 33 times at the Bank in 2014. Author Mr Anderton told the Times newspaper that he was 'astonished' to learn of its popularity at the Bank. He said: 'The economists at the Bank of England are top-notch, they certainly don't need to read my book.' The Bank currently provides development for secretaries, graduates and school leavers and was quick to point out that it holds copies of the book to support staff studying for  exams. Explanation: The Bank currently provides development for secretaries, graduates and school leavers and was quick to point out that it holds copies of the book to support staff studying for A-level exams .

Other popular titles include a work by one of chancellor George Osborne's favourite authors This Time is Different : Eight Centuries of Financial Folly co-authored by Kenneth Rogoff. Perhaps to the chagrin of the Bank's governor Mark Carney is the popularity of The Bankers' New Clothes by Anat Admati, an advisor to US financial regulator the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. A book by Anat Admati, an author highly critical of Governor Mark Carney, pictured, was among the most popular reads . Mr Admati famously criticised Mr Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January claiming he had mislead the public by suggesting that progress had been made tackling the too-big-to-fail banks. Other popular reads at the bank include House of Debt by Atif Milan and Amir Sufi, Wrong: Nine Economic Policy Disasters and What We Can Learn From Them by Richard Grossman. Last year a freedom of information request revealed that the most popular book in the Houses of Parliament library was ‘How Parliament Works’ by Roger Roberts. The book- described as a comprehensive guide to the complexities of Westminster - was taken out 16 times by MPs trying to get a grips on the complicated workings of Parliament. MPs were also found to be reading a great deal of non-political material including a Lonely Planet travel guide and a book advocating the stress-relieving benefits of meditation. The travel companion to Burma includes references to the water-bound temples on tranquil Inle Lake and hot air ballooning over the ancient city of Bagan. The guide by John Allen was the eight most popular loan over the last financial year.","Economics by Alain Anderton is a textbook for As and A-level students .

"When it comes to teaching children about manners, safety or even sex, most parents don't hesitate in making sure their offspring have a good understanding (no matter how awkward they may find it). However, despite the huge importance placed on financial education, more than half of UK parents admit they find it difficult to talk to their kids about money, and are avoiding the topic for as long as possible. A report from the government’s Money Advice Service found parents are simply leaving it too late, claiming children start forming money habits from as young as seven, whereas mums and dads leave discussing savings from around nine. Scroll down for video . Parents should talk to their children about savings from a young age, according to Kalpana . The majority of parents agree that they are the biggest influencer when it comes to teaching their children about money, and insight from the Money Advice Service has shown the more mums and dads talk to their children and give them responsibility from an early age, the better they will become at saving and planning for their future. Financial education truly begins at home, so what can parents do to help their children get to grips with finance? Here, financial journalist and founder of blog MummyMoneyMatters.com Kalpana Fitzpatrick reveals her top seven tips. 1. Start young . Start talking to your child about money from as early an age as possible – five is not too young. It's important for parents to make the lesson appropriate for their child's age. With a son or a daughter who is five years old, mums and dads can start talking to them about different types of coins and let them pay for things when out shopping, so they get used to handling money, or play shops with them at home using pretend cash. 2. Open a savings account . Opening a dedicated savings account for your child is great way to show them how their money can grow, and can also help start conversations about how long it may take to reach a certain amount of money. It will also start to teach them the very basics on investments and savings. 3. Let them make mistakes . It is important to give your children an allowance and let them use it as they choose. Yes, they may well make what you consider to be the wrong choice, but they will learn from those mistakes, which is important for their financial learning curve. It is better for them learn from small amounts now at a young age, rather than bigger amounts when they are older when the consequences would be far more serious. 4. Be confident . Parents should remember when teaching their children about money, that they are helping them to learn a lifelong skill - so confidence is a must. Some mums and dads are afraid to broach the subject, uncertain that they will be saying the right things, or feeling out of their depth. It's important to start with the basics, and remember that any glimpse into handling financial matters that parents can offer their children will stand them in good stead for the future. It is important to give your children an allowance and let them use it as they choose (file photo) 5. Pay for chores . Rewarding children for work around the house is the perfect way to teach them about earning money. Whether it's doing the washing up, washing the car or tidying their room, giving them a little cash for them to save or spend as they wish will introduce them to the working world. Parents could also ask their children to think about and work out how many times they would have to, say, wash the car to pay for the Xbox they so want, so they are familiar with the value of money. 6. Make it gradual . Parents should introduce their child's financial education gradually - if mums and dads haven't spoken before about savings and how to use money, don't jump in with one long chat, as it will become boring and feel like a chore to them. Introduce it gradually, making it a fun thing rather than a serious lesson, and make sure it's ongoing, developing your child's awareness as their familiarity with money grows. 7. Be consistent . Although most parents give their children a sum of pocket money, only 36 per cent of mums and dads say they do so on a regular basis. Being irregular and offering varied amounts can actually make it harder for children to learn about budgeting. Be consistent. For parents giving their child pocket money, do so on the same day, with the same amount, and discuss with them, in a lighthearted way, what they can buy with that money, or what happens when they pop it into their piggy bank - the amount they have doubles by the following installment. According to child psychologist Dr Elizabeth Kilbey, it can be 'very empowering' to give your children skills and confidence with money, so that they don't have to face money worries in the future. This year’s theme for this week's Global Money Week is ‘Save Today, Safe Tomorrow’ – parents can be part of helping children achieve this.","Majority of parents avoid talking about money with their kids .
Only 43% of parents think they are better savers than their children .
More than 40% believe children should not have to worry about money .
More than a quarter feel awkward to talk about money to anyone at all .

"From the aroma of fresh coffee to the unpleasant whiff of the subway, New York has its own heady mix of signature smells. While this mixture can, at times, be overpowering, back in the 19th century, smells in the city were far more pungent and permanent than they are today. So much so, that the health authorities at the time decided to create maps of stenches to show the location of smells from areas such as oil refineries, fat renderers, slaughter houses and gas works. In the 19th Century. New Yorkers began complaining to the Board of Health about 'the most nauseous, foul, stinking, and pestilential odours'.  As a result, many of the worst-smelling industries ended up in Brooklyn, with the industrial landscape leaving its mark there today. For instance, the Newtown Creek area on the border of Brooklyn and Queens remains the site of a sewage treatment plant . Now CityLab has found one of these historic maps from 1870 that shows different industrial sites across Manhattan and Brooklyn, as the five boroughs were yet to be consolidated. But it wasn't just industrial smells that caused problems for New Yorkers. The map was produced at a time when New York was experiencing unprecedented growth. During the 1860s and 1870s, 2,000 new buildings were constructed each year, as immigration peaked at 200,000 to 300,000 people annually. The increase in population meant an increase in waste. Public baths, drinking fountains, and restrooms were only built 1897, and flies plagued the streets. As a result, New Yorkers began complaining to the Board of Health about 'the most nauseous, foul, stinking, and pestilential odours', . In the 19th century, it was believed that these foul odors carried diseases, so the New York City Metropolitan Board of Health created the map to highlight the areas affected. 'Trying to show smells, which are not concrete - they're invisible, they're ephemeral, they're always changing - is just a really fascinating cultural project,' says Melanie Kiechle, a historian at Virginia Tech University told Atlantic's CityLab. The map was produced at a time when New York was experiencing huge growth. During the 1860s and 1870s, 2,000 new buildings were constructed each year, as immigration peaked at 200,000 to 300,000 people annually. Pictured is a a 1858 panorama of the city . The increase in population meant an increase in waste. Public baths and restrooms were built only after 1897, and flies were everywhere. Pictured is an 1884 image of streetcars running past the Astor House Hotel, along Broadway and Vesey Street in Manhattan . Inhaling the delicate bouquet of a glass of wine can leave most of us at a loss for words to describe what we are smelling. But it turns out it may be our language that is hampering our sense of smell. Researchers found those who use English as their first language can take five times as long to describe an odour than they can a colour. However, native speakers from the Jahai tribe in Perak, Malaysia, described odours far more consistently and in less time than colour. The Jahai have at least 12 specific abstract words that relate to smells while the Maniq, a tribe of hunter gatherers in southern Thailand, have 15 words. Tanvi Misra notes how health officials at the time had to sniff the air to document where the smells were coming from and which way they were blowing. The map largely highlighted industrial smells and a New York Times reporter at the time described their job with heavy sarcasm, according to a report by Ms Kiechle. 'The homes of these [sickening stenches] are along the shores of the East River, and by dodging in and out of slips with a tug-boat, and by creeping and climbing over oil-lighters and rotten string-pieces, they were finally reached by the committeemen without loss of life or limb,' he said. Many of the worst-smelling industries ended up in Brooklyn, with the industrial landscape leaving its mark there today. For instance, the Newtown Creek area on the border of Brooklyn and Queens remains the site of a sewage treatment plant. CityLab notes that winds would still carry smells from Brooklyn to Manhattan, causing problems between regulators in each of the districts. Manhattan  had some of its own smells to contend with. Meat marketing and processing facilities, for example, were established along the shoreline at the time. To reduce the smell, the board pushed slaughterhouses north of 40th Street in 1868 and then banned them from between 40th Street  in 1870, according to theChemical Heritage Foundation. While the idea that smells carry disease has long passed, authorities are still keen to map areas of the city that contribute to illness. Last month, scientists from Weill Cornell Medical College a unveiled 'microbial map' of the city after spending 18 months swabbing turnstiles, ticket kiosks, railings and benches for DNA on the world's largest transport system. They found 15,152 different types of microorganisms that share the train with its 5.5 million riders, including bubonic plague, dysentery and meningitis.

"An Indiana lawmaker has admitted he had 'poor judgement' after he was named as the author of graphic texts  to Anthony Weiner's former sexting partner Sydney Leathers under the name 'b***h boy'. Rep Justin Moed issued an apology after allegedly sending nude photographs of himself and gifts to Leathers, who was tied to a 2013 sexting scandal involving the former New York congressman and mayoral candidate. Moed, 31, is believed to have communicated under the Twitter account b*tchboy4you, which got in touch with the adult film actress who said she was looking for a 'slave' to 'financially dominate'. Scroll down for video . Rep. Justin Moed (pictured) of Indiana has issued an apology after allegedly sending nude photos and sexts to adult film actress Sydney Leathers . Leathers (above) was previously in the spotlight back in 2011 for a sexting relationship she had with New York congressman and mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner . The legislator for his state's 97th district, whose profile picture on Twitter was of an unidentified man's backside, sent multiple explicit photos to Leathers,according to TheDirty.com. The website shows the alleged Moed account sending a picture of a naked man and saying he had sex with him several times. Content from conversations reported on the website has not been verified. Moed kept his communication with Leathers anonymous by never using his actual email, but his identity was revealed when  his name appeared on a gift he sent Leathers from his Amazon account - a Fetish Fantasy Series Pink Leash & Collar. Another receipt also shows a purchase for Steve Madden heels for the Evansville, Indiana, resident. The alleged private Twitter conversations between Moed and Leathers show the Democrat referencing Weiner's scandal, saying it got the actress 'a lot of attention probably good and bad.' Messages also show the man thought to be Moed offering to put his sexting partner up in the 'nicest hotel downtown' in Indianapolis, where the cheapest rooms start at $200 a night. Moed pictured with his fiancee Rachel Ranz, who he met at Butler University. The pair are set to marry in September . In a statement to the media yesterday, Moed said he was 'truly sorry I have hurt the ones I love most with my poor judgment. I am committed to rebuilding trust with my family and my community. ... I apologize to my constituents and to everyone I have let down.' It comes as he is set to be married this September. Moed did not directly address the sexting allegations, though his apology followed TheDirty.com report that identified him as the sexting partner of Leathers. The same site released more alleged graphic sexts they claim came from Moed late Tuesday night. In an interview with the New York Post last week, Leathers spoke about Moed, who had not yet been named. 'Is he displaying poor judgment by sexting me of all people? Obviously,' she said. She said that the lawmaker was 'into some really freaky stuff. He wanted to be forced to wear a French maid outfit and clean my house while I degraded him. He wanted to be tied up and left in a closet to watch me have sex with my boyfriend.' The pair never met in person despite conversations that seem to be arranging meet ups, according to the Post. Leathers said that the politician was displaying 'poor judgement' by sexting her, a phrase later echoed by Moed himself . Other alleged leaked conversations show the alleged Moed account hoping to paint the porn star's toenails on Valentine's Day or texting Leather when he was on his way to a funeral. The B*tch Boy Twitter account is no longer visible on the social media site. Indiana Republican House Speaker Brian Bosma was briefed by staff on the reports Tuesday and called the matter 'an unfortunate situation' according to a House spokeswoman, The Indianapolis Star reported. Moed is serving his second term in the Indiana House and is a former Indiana House staffer. According to his official site, he is 'a graduate of Butler University and homeowner in Garfield Park, Justin Moed was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives on Nov. 6, 2012, with a goal of putting people and solutions first.' The lawmaker could not be reached for comment beyond what was in his statement. A spokesman for House Democrats declined to comment. Leathers also has yet to comment following Moed's statement. In December she posted a message she replied to a question from Moed's alleged Twitter account 'Who's your next politician to seduce?' with the answer 'all of them'. Weiner's sexting scandal in 2013 is thought to have sunk his bid for New York City Mayor. He resigned from Congress after a similar incident in 2011. US Rep. Weiner was forced to step down following his messages with Leathers, sent under the name Carlos Danger, were exposed .","Rep Justin Moed of Indiana has issued an apology for sexting .

"Police in North Carolina have spent the past three months searching for an elderly Caucasian bank robber, but instead found a 28-year-old African-American suspect with a penchant for disguise.

Target: Constant is suspected of robbing the Carolinas Telco Federal Credit Union in Cornelius on December 29 . Constant is facing charges of robbery with a dangerous weapon, making a false bomb threat, evading arrest and failure to identify. He is being held on $70,000 bond. Benoit Constant is suspected of robbing the Carolinas Telco Federal Credit Union in Cornelius on December 29, reported WCNC. Surveillance video from inside the bank showed a white man in dark sunglasses, a baseball cap and blue gloves pointing a handgun at a bank teller with one hand while holding a bag for the cash in the other. Partner in crime: Milandra Constant, Benoit's alleged accomplice, has been charged with making a false bomb threat to create a diversion during the robbery . During the heist, someone also called in a false bomb threat to the Lake Norman YMCA on the other side of town, in what investigators believe was a diversion created by Constant's accomplice to draw police away from the credit union. CCTV cameras captured images of the same silver van with a Delaware registration near the targeted bank and the YMCA, which officials later tracked down to Maryland about a week after the robbery. Constant's alleged partner in crime, Milandra Constant, was behind the wheel of the vehicle. Inside, police found a lifelike mask resembling the bank robber and the striped bag seen in the surveillance footage, according to WSOC-TV. At around 11.30am on Sunday, Benoit Constant was traveling southbound on US-28 in Wichita Falls, Texas, when state troopers stopped his Lexus for a traffic violation. Constant initially gave the troopers a fake name, but when they ran his plates, they found out that the motorist was wanted in North Carolina on robbery charges. The 28-year-old man bolted out of the car and tried to flee on foot but was quickly apprehended in a residential neighborhood. The suspected bank robber is currently awaiting extradition to North Carolina to face charges in connection to the December heist.

"The victim of a paedophile teacher says she felt like a 'weight was lifted from her shoulders' when she saw her tormentor finally jailed for the abuse which ruined her childhood. Angela Taylor, now 50, was just one of many nine and 10-year-old children targeted by Ronald Wotton on a daily basis at East Durham Catholic primary school between 1968 and 1980. She went to police in the wake of the Jimmy Savile revelations after telling herself she couldn't take the truth about her abuse to the grave. Ms Taylor has now waived her anonymity to tell how the abuse affected her life and of her relief at seeing Wotton convicted and sent to jail. Angela Taylor was one of a number of pupils targeted by a paedophile teacher in the 1960s and 70s. She has waived her anonymity to tell of the impact the abuse had on her life and of her relief at seeing him jailed . During her school days, Wotton would catch Angela's eye during lessons, call her up to the front of the class and make her stand behind his desk while he sexually abused her. Children were so afraid of the teacher, they would make themselves vomit by pouring washing up liquid down their throats to avoid his classes. Wotton, now 73, was finally reported over thirty years later in 2013 when Ms Taylor read about allegations of child abuse committed by Jimmy Savile and rang police. Her complaint was the first and started off a huge police investigation which led to 20 other victims coming forward. During his sentencing on November 5 last year, Teesside Crown Court heard that Wotton was a bully who had an obsession with authority and abused children for his own sexual gratification. The court heard how Wotton's offending extended to PE lessons, where he would make children touch their toes so he could look at them, as well as wandering into their changing rooms during swimming lessons, in the hope of seeing them naked. Wotton, who now uses a wheelchair, admitted 17 counts of indecent assault, three counts of indecency with a male and one of indecency with a child over a 12-year period from the late 1960s and was jailed for five years. Ronald Wotton's victim described him as an 'evil bully' who wrecked the childhoods of his pupils . Angela, of Newcastle, Tyne and Wear, said: 'I was terrified of Ronald, he was an evil bully and he ruined my childhood as well as many other people's lives. 'I came from a devout Catholic family, my mother was a teacher and I was made to feel as though God was punishing me for something I had done wrong. 'In Year 5, the year I went into Ronald's class, it was common knowledge that something bad was going to happen to us and we were all afraid. 'I couldn't confide in any of my family and he was just getting away with abusing us - I feel completely let down by the school and my religion. Ms Taylor, pictured aged nine in 1973, says the abuse she suffered at the hands of her teacher has impacted her whole life . 'I feel as though he has made me the adult I am today, I've found it hard to trust men and be the best mother I can be because of him.' As a child, Ms Taylor was shy and grew to hate school because of Wotton's abuse. She would often feign illness and beg not to attend because she was scared of being abused by him again. She became depressed when she went to secondary school and hid the abuse for 40 years. She finally called the police to report him in July 2013. Ms Taylor, who is now training to become a chiropodist, said: 'I was sitting watching the news about Jimmy Saville and Stuart Hall and I thought - I cannot die with this sordid secret. 'When I rang the police I felt as though a weight had been lifted from my shoulders. 'I had carried guilt and shame around for years because I felt I was to blame. I lost my childhood and part of myself. It did a lot of damage. 'It feels good to know that my actions have inspired others to come forward and report him as well. 'I was prepared to stand up and look him in the eye to tell everyone what he did to me. He is an evil, disgusting human being. 'Five years is not long enough for the suffering he caused to hundreds of innocent children like me, but I am now glad he is in jail, paying for his crime and I can finally move on. 'I only hope my story can persuade others to be brave and stand up to people like him so they can be brought to justice. 'There is a lot of help available from Victim Support and Rape Crisis. Having a safe place to talk everything through really makes a big difference. 'It is not an easy path but you come out of it feeling stronger.'","Teacher carried out a catalogue of sex offences from the 1960s onwards .

Mr Hussain was taken to Methodist Hospital Northlake Hospital in stable condition. Lake County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Patricia Van Til says the road is clearly marked with numerous barricades including orange barrels and cones, large wood signs stating 'Road Closed' with orange striped markings and concrete barriers across the road. The deadly crash took place at around 9.30am at the Riley Road exit on southbound Cline Avenue. The ramp has been closed since 2009. According to police, the Hussains were apparently on their way to visit relatives because they had food in the car, reported NWI Times. Investigators suspect the 64-year-old motorist was following GPS directions when he bypassed several barricades blocking the road and ultimately drove his 2014 Nissan Sentra off the bridge.

"An episode of a popular children's show has apparently been pulled off the air after disgusted parents noticed cartoonists had drawn a picture of a pair of bare breasts into a scene. Oggy and the Cockroaches is a French animated comedy series produced by Xilam and Gaumont Film Company and which airs on the Nickelodeon children's TV cartoon channel NickToons. But the comedy has caused fury among some parents after an episode showed a framed picture of a topless lady showing off her assets. Scroll down for video . An episode of popular children's TV show Oggy and the Cockroaches has been pulled from the air after angry parents complained about this scene (pictured) which shows a topless woman in a picture in the  background . The busty topless cartoon character - who appears to be a duck  blessed with an enormous bosom - was in the background of an episode which aired in the US on March 5. She also sports a pair of tiny bikini briefs, giant sunglasses and a bouffant hair-do. The NickToons US website now appears to have removed the show from both its schedule and the show's homepage, although some character's 'profile pages' remain live. But TV schedules for the next few days show other episodes are still billed to air in the US. NickToons UK and Ireland began airing the show in September last year and shows new episodes every weekend morning. It is unclear if the show will also be removed from the air in Britain. Nickelodeon's US website now appears to have removed the show from both its schedule and the show's homepage, although some pages remain live . One father told TMZ his child spotted the pair of breasts on his faourite show and was 'extremely unhappy' about it - particularly has he was forced to have an chat about anatomy with his 8-year-old son. MailOnline has contacted Nickelodeon and Xilam for a comment. Many viewers have taken to social media to discuss 'boobgate'. Hedda G wrote: 'Of course the image was inappropriate. That being said an eight year old boy is in 3rd grade. He should know about breasts. The little guy should have a basic understanding.' Christine added: 'Cartoonists have been doing this c*** for ages especially Disney. Parents still take their kids to Disney cartoons. Other things to worry about people.' Megan Mayhew wrote on Facebook: 'Ok so it's ok for women to breastfeed in public but a cartoon of boobs is horrible. If an eight year old has never noticed women have boobs than I'm glad his dad had a talk with him. Stop making the naked body so taboo.' Selina Fraley said: 'Wait so the father was concerned about the boobs in the background but not the filth that his kids was watching I mean, the characters were poisoning each other and lit eachother on fire!

"The body of an ex-Royal Marine who was the first Briton to be killed while fighting against ISIS has been returned to his family in a 'comforting' ceremony attended by hundreds of Syrian Kurds. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, from Barnsley, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting in Syria alongside Kurdish forces in the frontline village of Tel Khuzela. The 25-year-old's body was given to his father and uncle in a ceremony on the Syria-Iraq border involving hundreds of Syrian Kurds flying their brightly coloured flags. Scroll down for video . Respect: Hundreds of Syrian Kurds attended a ceremony, during which they handed over Konstandinos Erik Scurfield's body to his grieving father and uncle, who had travelled to the region . Killed: Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting in Syria alongside the Kurds . The coffin - which has a picture of Mr Scurfield attached, and was draped in both the Kurdish and Union flags - is accompanied by a guard of honour, comprised of both male and female soldiers. At one point, a woman dressed in a headscarf pulls Mr Scurfield's devastated father Chris close to him, to kiss him on the head. The gathered crowd then watched as the coffin was loaded onto an ambulance to be taken to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Chris later told the BBC the ceremony was 'overwhelming' and 'very special and very comforting' to his family. The Foreign Office refused to comment on when his body might be repatriated. Mr Scurfield, who was an expert in battlefield medicine, is believed to have travelled to Syria three or four months ago hoping to provide medical and humanitarian support. Tribute: Mr Scurfield's coffin was carried out by Kurdish fighters, who had gathered to pay their respects . Honour: The coffin, which was draped in both the Union and Kurdish flags, was then taken to Erbil . He was said to have been 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out by ISIS'. His family, including archaeologist parents Chris and Vicci and his student sister Georgianna, said they were heartbroken but proud of him. In a statement following his death they said: 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.' While high numbers of foreigners are known to have joined IS, around 100 Westerners - including several Britons - are thought to have travelled to fight alongside the Kurds.

"More than 50 drunk teenagers trashed a family home after spotting a Facebook post which said the 15-year-old daughter was having a couple of friends over. Horrified mother-of-four Karen McGuinness, 47, of Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, was forced to return early from a holiday after neighbours called and told her drunk youngsters were trashing her home. She had gone away for a short break believing her children were all out for the night, when daughter Simona, 15, returned to the house with a couple of friends to listen to music on Saturday night. Horrified Karen McGuinness was forced to return from her holiday after neighbours called and told her drunken teenagers were trashing her home and garden (pictured) after her address was posted on Facebook . Some of the yobs boasted about their exploits and sent these pictures to friends over the Snapchat app . But when one of Simona's friends posted on Facebook that she was off to an 'empty' she posted the address of the £75,000 house - and plans for a quiet night went out of the window. Around 50 teenagers, most of them unknown to Simona, descended on the house in the upmarket suburb and caused thousands of pounds worth of damage in less than an hour. Neighbours went to the house at the height of the mayhem and told the yobs to leave but were ignored - so they called Mrs McGuinness at around 10.30pm. Mrs McGuinness, a single mother and support worker at a school for children with special needs said she was 'traumatised' after rushing home and seeing the destruction to her property. 'They totally trashed my house. Every part of my home is ruined. What kind of kids are out there doing this?' she told the Daily Record. Karen McGuinness (pictured) said she was 'traumatised' after rushing home and seeing the destruction . Mrs McGuinness said the house was completely trashed following the party - her son's room is pictured . Neighbours on the quiet street (pictured) in the upmarket suburb of Newton Mearns were forced to call police . The teenage yobs pulled her son's TV off his wall, before stamping on it and even chucked his Xbox out of his bedroom window. Mrs McGuinness said she had locked her bedroom door before she left, but when she returned home she found it had been kicked off its hinges and will need to be replaced. The yobs also damaged the stairs, bannister and walls, smashed her outside decking to pieces and even emptied her cupboards and fridge. A devastated Mrs McGuinness found her home covered in flour, sugar, pasta and smashed eggs, ruining her carpets, cushions and curtains. Mrs McGuinness had locked her bedroom door before she left the house - she found it kicked off its hinges and her room ruined by the youngsters . She said: 'Liquids were poured over my bedding, the bathroom was covered in shampoo, shower gel and toilet paper, and toothpaste was everywhere.' To make matters worse the teenagers vomited copiously throughout the house and Mrs McGuinness says she is still cleaning up. She also says someone stole her set of rosary beads which had belonged to her father - who died just six months ago. Mrs McGuinness has said she has no idea how she will pay to repair all the damage, as her insurers are refusing to pay out - arguing the teenagers were technically invited to the house. She added that the incident has left her feeling vulnerable in her own home. She said: 'This is a nice area. I've lived here 20 years and you'd never think in a million years that this could happen. 'I can't understand what type of families these children come from.' When neighbours called the police,  officers found the vandals still at the scene but did not make any arrests. Most of the teenagers fled through neighbours' gardens, trashing them as they went. Mrs McGuinness said two boys even picked up a stone bird bath and threw it through a car windscreen as they ran. She says she has managed to track down some of the children who invaded her home and found they are all from the local area. Mrs McGuinness plans to ask their parents if they know what their children get up to when they are out. She added she wants to warn other parents about the dangers of Facebook and other social media sites, and said she does not want anyone else to go through what she has gone through. She said: 'I wasn't aware of the extent of Facebook and was totally oblivious to the power of it.'

"Only the quick thinking of a pilot averted a similar tragedy last year when a sister plane of the Germanwings jet suddenly lost altitude and nose-dived. A Lufthansa A321 – a longer version of the A320 – unexpectedly descended 3,000ft while cruising over Pamplona, Spain, last November. The jet, with 109 passengers and crew aboard, was at an altitude of 31,000ft when it started to lose height. The flight crew managed to regain control at 28,000ft. Scroll down for video . The Germanwings Airbus involved in today's crash (pictured) would have received a safety warning after a sister plane suddenly lost altitude last year. In that incident, the problem was corrected by the pilot . According to the European Air Safety Agency, a safety system designed to protect the jet reacted to incorrect data due to a faulty sensor. The safety warning related to all Airbus A318, A319, A320 and A321 – including the Airbus A320 involved in today’s disaster. In response, Airbus created a ‘temporary revision’ to all of the aircraft's flight manuals. The EASA determined that the Lufthansa aircraft's Angle of Attack probes got blocked while flying between Bilbao and Munich. The EASA warned that in such a situation 'the flight control laws order a continuous nose down pitch rate that, in a worst case scenario, cannot be stopped with backward sidestick inputs, even in the full backward position.' The agency added: 'This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of control of the aeroplane.' A similar Airbus plane to that involved in today's crash was put down in the Hudson River, New York in 2009 . In that incident, the pilot managed to crash land in the river and the passengers were saved after a bird strike . The A321 involved in the previous incident is a slightly longer version of the plane involved in today's crash, carrying an extra 40 passengers. Germanwings today confirmed that today's downed aircraft underwent a major inspection at Lufthansa in summer 2013 while it was last checked yesterday. The plane that crashed was called 'Mannheim' and made its first test flight in November 1990. It was then purchased by Lufthansa and had its first commercial flight in February 1991. Experts said the aircraft would have been nearing the end of its commercial life after more than 24 years of service. Since the first version of the Airbus A320 was released in 1987, around 4,000 have been built and the company say one takes off or lands somewhere in the world every 2.5 seconds. The A320 plane is a workhorse of modern aviation. Worldwide, 3,606 A320s are in operation, according to Airbus. The A320 family has a good safety record, with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million take-offs, according to a Boeing safety analysis. The safest part of a flight is when the plane is at cruise elevation. Just 10 per cent of fatal accidents occur at that point. In contrast, take-off and the initial climb accounts for 14 per cent of crashes, while final approach and landing accounts for 47 per cent. The A320 is certified to fly up to 39,000ft, its maximum altitude before its rate of climb begins to erode. However, the widely-used A320 family of aircraft have been involved in a number of crashes in the three decades they have been used, resulting in scores of deaths. In December an Airbus A320 crashed into the Java Sea killing all 162 people on board in an as-yet unexplained incident. The plane operated by AirAsia – owned by QPR chairman Tony Fernandes – vanished from radar screens in bad weather with initial reports suggesting it climbed so fast into a storm that it lost lift and plunged into the sea. One the first accident to involve one of the planes happened in the north east of France, not far from the current crash site, when an Air Inter flight came down in the Vosges mountains in 1992. The Airbus A320-111 was on its approach to Strasbourg airport when it hit La Bloss Mountain, killing 87 of the 96 people on board. Safe: Aviation experts tweeted this graphic showing just how many Airbus A320s are in the air at any time . The best-known recent incident involving the plane was when a domestic flight in the US had to put down in the Hudson River in New York. The US Airways flight from the city's LaGuardia Airport heading for Charlotte, North Carolina when it is believed to have flown into a flock of geese. The Airbus A320 like that involved in today's accident iS a short-haul, narrow-body airliner assembled in France, Germany and China. Around 4,000 of the single-aisle aircraft have been built and Airbus says the plane 'sets industry standards for comfort and operating economy on short- to medium-haul routes'. It typical seats around 150 passengers depending on the layout of the plane and has a cruising speed of 511mph and a range of up to 7,500 miles. It was ranked as the world's fastest selling aircraft bewteen 2005 and 2007 when it became popular with low-cost airlines. Captain Chesley Sullenberger was widely praised for landing the plane on the river, meaning none of the 155 people on board were seriously injured. One of the deadliest accidents involving one of the planes was in May 2006, when Armavia flight 967 crashed into the sea near Sochi, Russia. All 113 passengers and crew on the A320-211 died after it flew into terrible weather while approaching the southern Russian city after taking off from Yerevan, Armenia. Six years earlier, 143 people, including two Britons, lost their lives when a Gulf Air Airbus A320-212 went down in the Gulf of Bahrain after a three-long flight from Cairo. A number of factors were blamed for the night-time crash, including pilot error and poor training of staff.

"Albert Einstein may have been a genius, but even he could get it wrong sometimes. In the 1920s and 1930s, Einstein said he couldn't back the strange theory that the measurement of a particle actually affects its location. Now a team of scientists from Japan and Australia have proven that this 'spooky action at a distance' takes place in a photon. In the 1920s and 1930s, Einstein (left) said he couldn't back the strange theory that the measurement of a particle actually affects its location. Now a team of scientists from Japan and Australia have proven that this 'spooky action at a distance' takes place in a photon. Pictured on the right is professor Howard Wiseman . According to quantum mechanics, a single particle can be described by a wave function. It can be spreads over large distances, but is never detected in two or more places. This is because physicists believe the universe behaves like a little probability wave. Particles are in many places at once, each with some probability. This means if an electron was fired through two slits at a screen, it would go through both of them. But if you set up a pair of cameras to monitor the slit, the wave function collapses. As a result it only goes through on of the slits, rather than both. Professor Howard Wiseman at Griffiths University, who worked with the University of Tokyo, made measurements to show what Einstein did not believe to be real - namely the non-local collapse of a particle's 'wave function'. According to quantum mechanics, a single particle can be described by a wave function that spreads over large distances, but is never detected in two or more places. This phenomenon is explained in quantum theory by what Einstein disparaged in 1927 as 'spooky action at a distance.' This is the instantaneous collapse of the wave function to wherever the particle is detected. It happens because physicists believe the universe behaves like a little probability wave. Particles are in many places at once, each with some probability. This means if an electron was fired through two slits at a screen, it would go through both of them.  But if you set up a pair of cameras to monitor the slit, the wave function collapses. As a result it only goes through on of the slits, rather than both. Einstein didn't believe the phenomenon existed because it violates the theory of relativity which states that the speed of light is a limit on how fast any information can travel. Almost 90 years later, by splitting a single photon between two laboratories, scientists have used homodyne detectors - which measure wave-like properties - to show the collapse of the wave function is a real effect. According to Live Science, the paradox was resolved years later, when experiments showed that even though the interaction between two quantum particles happens faster than light, it is impossible use it to send information. By splitting a single photon between two laboratories, scientists have used homodyne detectors - which measure wave-like properties - to show the collapse of the wave function is a real effect . The report adds that while other experiments have shown entanglement with two particles, the new study entangles a photon with itself. This phenomenon is the strongest yet proof of the entanglement of a single particle, an unusual form of quantum entanglement that is being increasingly explored for quantum communication and computation. 'Einstein never accepted orthodox quantum mechanics and the original basis of his contention was this single-particle argument,' said Professor Wiseman. 'This is why it is important to demonstrate non-local wave function collapse with a single particle. 'Einstein's view was that the detection of the particle only ever at one point could be much better explained by the hypothesis that the particle is only ever at one point, without invoking the instantaneous collapse of the wave function to nothing at all other points. 'However, rather than simply detecting the presence or absence of the particle, we used homodyne measurements enabling one party to make different measurements and the other, using quantum tomography, to test the effect of those choices.' 'Through these different measurements, you see the wave function collapse in different ways, thus proving its existence and showing that Einstein was wrong.'","Previous experiments have shown entanglement with two particles .

"Do you know two people who are just perfect for each other? Well, now there's an app for that. Hitch, is being touted as the Tinder for matchmakers, as it lets people set up two Facebook friends. Named after the Will Smith film about a romantic guru who helps singles find love, the idea for the app was inspired after founder Anton Gu met a mutual friend one night but felt too bashful to ask his chums for her number. Scroll down for video . Dating app Hitch can be used whether you're single or in a relationship: users can set up two of their Facebook friends and introduce them with a personal message . Potential matchmakers just need to log into Facebook and select two friends they want to introduce and send them a message saying why they'd be a good match. Although singles are set up with each other anonymously initially, matchmakers can see how many messages the pair have exchanged once they've chosen to reveal their identities. The idea for the app all stemmed from a thwarted encounter. Founder Anton, from London, said: 'In February last year I went to a gig with a group of friends. There was a girl in the group  that I hadn’t met before who was a friend of a friend. 'She didn’t stay for very long and left, so I didn’t get a chance to talk to her. 'The next day I was sitting at home, thinking how could I get in touch with her. Short of asking our mutual friend for her number and being like “Hey, I’m that guy at the gig last night, I’d like to take you out”, I had nothing. Hitch founder Anton Gu says the idea behind the app was simple: 'I was single. I made an app.' And it's not only been a professional success for Anton, but a romantic one too . To create a hitch, you log in through Facebook and select two friends you want to introduce. The pair do not need to have the app installed to be selected - you can invite them later. 'I checked online and there was no app that I could use to get an introduction. So we made it.' And since that night, he's used his  creation to  improve his own love life. He said: 'By the time the app was out, that girl from the gig was dating someone. But my friend introduced me to someone else. She is incredible and we are dating now.' Hitch is available in 50 countries and around 2,000 hitches are made in the UK each month. Anton said: 'We grew very quickly in India. Matchmaking is popular in their culture, people understand the concept straight away and tell their friends about it. There is also huge potential in markets where online dating is difficult.' He said that because matches are being made through pools of mutual friends, it narrows down choices and feels reliable as friends are making the introductions. Mr Gu says the 'pick-up line' is always the same. Having a mutual friend makes communication very easy, meaning that 85 per cent of hitches result in conversation . Friends know better: Hitch is available to download in 50 countries, and users have increased particularly quickly in India, where matchmaking is a popular culture . He added that women are better matchmakers than men. 'There’s a lady in Texas, she has introduced 14 couples on Hitch. She’s really good at this! Recruitment consultant Joel Holford, 22, from London, is currently using Hitch but needs more friends to download it before he can see it transforming his love life. He said: 'I liked the idea of both setting up my friends and being set up anonymously. I downloaded the app, but the issue is, you have to have a lot of friends on there for it to work.' Anton says he hopes awareness of Hitch will continue to grow. He said: 'We think that people that are successful, will in turn tell their friends how they met  and introduce them.' Joel Holford, 22, says he likes the idea of Hitch, but points to the fact that it relies on many of your friends having the app too .","Hitch app lets you set up two of your friends through Facebook .

"Durham and Warwick are new entries in the world’s top 100 universities, with Oxbridge rivalling Harvard, it has been revealed. The UK now has 12 UK universities listed in the Times Higher Education Reputation Rankings - up from 10 last year and nine in 2013 - the second highest of any individual country. The rankings also show that Oxbridge rates higher than prestigious US universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford. Scroll down for video . New entries: Durham University (pictured) and Warwick entered the top 100 for the first time . The institutions have helped cement the UK’s position among the ‘global elite’ in higher education. Only the US has more entries in the top 100, with 43. Germany has the next most with six. The results show that for the fifth year in a row there is an elite group of six US and UK ‘super brands’, the authors suggested, which are ‘head and shoulders above the rest’. Harvard took first place again, followed by Cambridge which has moved up from fourth, and Oxford, which has risen from fifth to third. Taking fourth place was MIT, down two on last year, while Stanford fell two places to fifth and University of California, Berkeley remained in sixth. Other UK universities in the top 100 include Imperial College London, which falls one place to 14th, University College London, which is up eight places to 17th, and the London School of Economics and Political Science which has moved from 24th to 22nd. Soaring up the rankings are Edinburgh, which has moved from 46th place to 29th, and King’s College London, which has gone from 43rd to 31st. Manchester takes the 50th position and Bristol – which had dropped out the rankings last year - and the London Business School are in the 91-100 band. Top: Harvard was named number one, but  Cambridge and Oxford came second and third respectively . Warwick and Durham are two new entrants to the top 100 in the 81-90 band. Across the world, London and Paris have the highest number of prestigious universities in the world. Each have five universities in the top 100. But there are concerns that other areas of the UK – beyond the Oxbridge-London ‘golden triangle’ – are losing out. Phil Baty, editor of Times Higher Education Rankings, said: ‘This has been a good year for the UK, with the South East ‘golden triangle’ of London, Oxford and Cambridge cementing its position at the heart of higher education’s global elite, drawing in talent and investment from across the world.’ 1   Harvard, U.S. 2   Cambridge, UK . 3   Oxford, UK . 4   Massachusetts Institute of Technology,        U.S. 5   Stanford, U.S. 6   University of California, Berkeley, U.S. 7   Princeton, U.S. 8   Yale, U.S. 9   California Institute of Technology, U.S. 10 Columbia, U.S. He added: ‘It must be a concern for the many English regions that so many of our top institutions are concentrated in London and the South East. ‘England’s top six institutions (and seven of all 11 English universities in the ranking) are all in the Oxbridge-London ‘golden triangle’, and these institutions will continue to draw in the leading talent from England and beyond, supply the most desirable graduates into the local workforce and attract the lion’s share of business investment. It is a virtuous circle as success breeds future success. ‘Leeds and Sheffield universities both dropped out of the top 100 a few years ago, and there is no place for the flagship universities of major cities including Birmingham and Liverpool. ‘There is a risk that if resources for universities become even more scarce after the election, whoever wins, the rich of the South East will keep getting richer at the expense of the rest of the country.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable added: ‘Our reforms have helped to ensure British universities are some of the best funded in the world and even more competitive for excellence – second only to the United States. ‘However, other nations are hot on our heels, which is why we have taken steps to secure the reputation of our institutions by enabling them to have a sustainable income stream and removing student number controls from the next academic year to increase quality and accessibility.’ The rankings are based on a survey of about 10,000 academics in 142 countries.

"Entertainment reporter Peter Ford has spoken out in defence of his controversial tweet in which he slammed Chrissie Swan for leaving her one-year-old baby at home to appear on a reality show. MIX FM DJ Chrissie, who is currently the favourite to take out the crown on the channel 10 show I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, has been in the South African jungle for the past six weeks, leaving her three children in Australia with their father Chris Saville. Radio personality Ford came under fire for what some Twitter users have called a 'sexist' tweet, but he has hit back, telling Daily Mail Australia he was not trying to 'mummy shame' Swan but believes she has a choice to leave the jungle whenever she wants. Scroll down for video . Entertainment reporter Peter Ford has angered the Twitter community after slamming Chrissie Swan's (pictured with her daughter Peggy) decision to leave her one-year-old baby at home to appear on a reality show . Entertainment whiz Ford claimed that the 41-year-old radio and television personality is 'chasing fame' by taking part in the show and has expressed his doubts over what it says about today's society. 'Chrissie’s children are out there. She very happily uses them and talks about them all the time,' Ford told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm uncomfortable talking about her children, or any children underage but she happily uses them and talks about them so she’s made them public property.' Ford, who can be heard every morning on 6PR radio talking about all things celebrity, certainly didn't hold back when he sent  the controversial tweet out to his 8,700 followers. 'Chrissie Swan looks set to win Celeb. Not sure what it says about society that we reward a mother who leaves a 1 year old baby to chase fame,' the tweet said. Celebrity whiz Peter Ford has slammed Chrissie Swan on social media . The well-known entertainment correspondent has expressed his opinion on Swan . While some Twitter users were quick to point out that Freddie Flintoff and Merv Hughes also have children at home who they left behind, Ford said they haven't been crying about it on national TV. 'But we haven’t seen the men crying on camera about missing their children and none of them have a child who are one-year-old,' he said. 'Chrissie is free to leave whenever she wants but she's chosen to stay in there because obviously if she leaves she forfeits the money.' 'I never judged her, I'm not mummy shaming her, all I said was I couldn't do it. 'She must have more resilience and strength of character than I have but suddenly I've become the poster boy for the most hated man in Australia,' Ford said. Swan has made it down to the final three contestants on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here . Swan has three children - one-year-old Peggy, three-year-old Kit and seven-year-old Leo. On numerous occasions, the much-loved personality has expressed on air that she misses her children. She has been slammed in the past for smoking throughout her most recent pregnancy and burst out crying on I'm A Celebrity when telling her fellow camp that she missed her son Kit's first day of preschool. She also revealed on the show that Kit had a hearing impairment for the first few years of his life, leaving him unable to say 'mum'. Immediately after Ford sent out the tweet, a plethora of angry responses flooded hisTwitter feed, with many claiming ford, whose bio says he is the 'best informed entertainment correspondent in Australia', was taking a 'cheap shot' at the reality star. 'You had a cheap shot at her character by saying she's chasing fame,' one Twitter user said. Chrissie and her son Leo are pictured here walking with her partner Chris Saville. He is in Australia taking care of the couple's three kids . Chrissie has cried on the show over the fact that she missed her son Kit's first day in preschool because she was in the South African jungle . 'Perhaps, just perhaps @ChrissieSwan is doing the show to feed her family?' another commenter said. Ford has been questioning Chrissie's involvement in the show since the opening night. On January 31st, the night I'm A Celebrity debuted in Australia, Ford tweeted: 'Finally that recurring title attached to Chrissie as one of Australia's most loved stars will be put to the test. Time will tell.' After a barrage of abuse from angry Chrissie Swan fans, Ford said it was simply his opinion that Chrissie should not have left her children at home to take part in the show. The reality star recently confessed on the show that she believes she's shed an impressive ten kilos during her stint in the jungle. Ford has let his opinions on Chrissie be known to his Twitter followers . Chrissie Swan recently revealed that she's lost 10kg in the jungle . 'She can do whatever she wants. I simply said I couldn't do it . She must be stronger & wiser than me,' he said. Chrissie has made it down to the final three on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. The final will air on Sunday night and Chrissie is hotly tipped to win and be crowned queen of the jungle. If she wins, her nominated charity, CARE Australia, are set to receive $100,000.","Peter Ford has  spoken out about his controversial tweet .

"The drawbacks of being a working Mum caught up with Madison Ashton when on a trip to her son's school the teenagers gathered around, not to chat to their mate's parent, but to get a good look at a high-class escort, porn star and mistress. For a change the teenagers had no problems doing their homework as they'd obviously been studying the notorious Ms Ashton for quite a while. 'The boys were swarming around me, and I could hear them mentioning my work name under their breath,' Ms Ashton told New Idea magazine. 'Unfortunately, they'd been online and obviously knew just who I was.' Scroll down for video . Madison Ashton (pictured here at court in 2012) lost her appeal against the estate of the late cardboard billionaire, Richard Pratt, in February . It was an experience that she worried would have a bad effect on her 13-year-old son Xavier, but she had no need to worry. 'I asked what was going on and he said a few boys had told him: ""Hey your Mum's a prostitute."" But he didn't take any notice,' she explained. 'He just went back to playing handball, because he thought they were d**kheads anyway. I was totally blown away by how brave and mature Xavier is.' Ms Ashton - who also has a 17-year-old daughter Indra - only tells Xavier that she goes to work and can't discuss it in detail because it involves adult services. The 40-year-old made it clear that she was always honest with her children about what she does and kept everything very 'matter-of-fact'. But considering her notoriety it's hard for her at times to stay out of the news. Last month she lost her appeal against the estate of billionaire Richard Pratt, who she said promised her millions. Ms Ashton launched an appeal against the 2012 decision to reject her bid for part of the cardboard king's estate. Ms Ashton said Mr Pratt had promised to set up two trust funds, worth $2.5 million each, for her two children and pay her $500,000 as a 'retainer' to stop working as an escort and become his mistress. Although the Supreme Court agreed the pair had the conversation, it found Ms Ashton's acceptance of $100,000 and the transfer of car into her name was done in full satisfaction of the trust claim. In November 2005, Ms Ashton signed a document from a employee of Mr Pratt's company, Visy Industries, that released Mr Pratt from any financial responsibility in exchange for a payment of $50,000 to the former mistress. Mr Pratt died in 2009. Billionaire Mr Pratt died in 2009 . Ms Ashton appeared before the Supreme Court of NSW in February but her case was dismissed . In appealing the decision, Ms Ashton sought a declaration that Mr Pratt's 2003 promises constituted a legally binding contract and anything she signed in November 2005 was void. She also sought damages from Mr Pratt's widdoe, Jeanne Pratt. But on Monday, the Court of Appeal dismissed her bid, saying the arrangement failed to spell out important terms such as Ms Ashton's obligations as mistress, how long it would last and the details of how the trusts would work. The court said Ms Ashton had received substantial gifts as Mr Pratt's mistress and there was nothing to suggest she was prevented from returning to the escort industry. Madison Ashton, who was once showered with gifts as Mr Pratt's mistress, claims the two of them were in a de-facto relationship, and it was not just a 'business' arrangement the pair had. Madison Ashton who was known as one of Australia’s most notorious prostitutes - aka Christine McQueen — stopped working as a hooker in 2003 after Pratt (right) promised her he would look after her and her two children . Ms Ashton, who also sued the cardboard baron's estate for $10 million in 2012 lost and racked up a million dollar legal bill. In September, The Daily Telegraph reported, the court heard Pratt had a 'voracious appetite' for young woman like Ms Ashton and that promising her five million dollars wouldn't have been very much money to such a wealthy man. Ms Ashton, who was known as one of Australia’s most notorious prostitutes - aka Christine McQueen — stopped working as an escort in 2003 after Mr Pratt promised he would look after her and her two children. It was reported she claimed to have given up a lucrative career in the high class escort business to become Mr Pratt's mistress . A book called 'Mistress: The True Stories of Mistresses and Their Men' released last year delved into the couples bizarre relationship. Ms Ashton said Mr Pratt had promised to set up two trust funds, worth $2.5 million each, for her two children and pay her $500,000 as a 'retainer' to stop working as an escort and become his mistress . The late Richard Pratt who was elected as Carlton's Football club's president Richard Pratt in 2007 was claimed to be in a de-facto relationship with prostitute Madison Ashton . Writer Matthew Benns and co-author Terry Smyth say Mr Pratt was one of Australia's business giants, but  it wasn't just wealth that pleased him. Rather, he had an 'apparently endless desire' for sex, Benns and Smyth wrote, sustaining two long-running affairs with a pair of young women from the bush. They were Shari-Lea Hitchcock, from Cambewarra, on the New South Wales south coast; and Peggy Jane Heslop - better known as Madison Ashton, sex worker and Penthouse Pet - who came from Wangaratta, in Victoria's north-east. Hitchcock was a 'blonde bombshell, 35 years his junior,' Benns and Smyth wrote. While Ashton was described as a canny brothel-owner with a troubled childhood.","Ms Ashton's had gone to see her 13-year-old son Xavier at his school .

"As a policeman in the Chinese city of Chongqing, Long Keyi is well used to stopping traffic. But he caused a hold-up of a different kind recently while on duty for the city's marathon. The race's female runners thought that he was so good looking that they abandoned their race and surrounded him, battling for the chance to take a selfie with him. No escape: Long Keyi is surrounded in his car by admirers - forcing him to call for (presumably less handsome) back-up . Stopped in their tracks: Female runners take a break from the race to have a snap taken with the officer, who many said looked like the film star Wallace Chung . The 29-year-old was mobbed at the race in south-western China partly because many of the admirers thought he looked like a leading Chinese film star, according to the People's Daily Online. Hundreds of admirers posted pictures online, with many pointing out his resemblance to actor Wallace Chung. Yuan Chung, 25, said: 'I thought he looked just like the actor from Hong Kong, Wallace Chung, the guy who is in the news at the moment because of his latest role as a TV cop.' The crowds became so big, the policeman was surrounded in his car as he tried to leave the sporting event. Chyou Teng, 26, who posted a photo, said the furore distracted people from the race.

She said: 'I remember reading that some Kenyan runner was the winner but you didn't see him in the newspaper coverage, everybody was just going on about this policeman. 'He was very good natured about it though, and posed for the pictures quite happily.' Race organisers in the Chongqing Municipality confirmed it had caused congestion with many runners wanting their picture taken alongside him. But Long's colleagues said his new legion of fans would be left disappointed as he had recently married. Arresting: Marathon runners and supporters flock to take pictures of the handsome officer in south-western China . Fellow police officer  Dewei Fu said: 'He only just got back on duty after getting married, so I don't think his new wife will be too impressed. 'Anyway, it was getting a bit out of hand so he was taken off duty and replaced by another less good-looking colleague.'","The handsome police officer caused delays as runners stop to take photos .

"Jesamine Hearsum, who trapped a female friend in her home before sexually assaulting her, has flouted a restraining order by sending the victim threatening texts . A lesbian who trapped a female friend in her home before sexually assaulting her has flouted a restraining order by sending the victim threatening texts, a court heard. Jesamine Hearsum stripped naked and attacked the woman during a hour-long hostage ordeal after she refused to have sex with her last year. The 32-year-old was spared jail, despite pleading guilty to false imprisonment, sexual assault, assault by beating and harassment in November. She was handed a three-year restraining order banning her from contacting the victim, and two years in prison, suspended for two years. But the court heard that just a few weeks after she was sentenced, Hearsum began texting the woman. Prosecutor Nick O'Brien said that at first her messages had been apologetic. 'They then changed to wanting her back and then changed again to threatening,' said Mr O'Brien. 'The victim didn't report these breaches because she didn't want to feel responsible for putting Hearsum in prison.' However, he said, Hearsum then sent a text saying 'I should have f***ed you up when I had a chance.' She sent another text saying she should have gone to the victim's boyfriend's house to 'mess him up.' When the victim replied that she would report the texts to the police Hearsum replied 'You should, I am not in the right place.' Hearsum then sent several Facebook messages to the victim's sister before texting 'Did anyone call the Old Bill? Text back.' Mr O'Brien said Hearsum, from Cashes Green, Stroud, was arrested later the same day. At Gloucester Crown Court she admitted two charges of breaching the restraining order but was again spared jail. Judge William Hart deferred sentencing until June 15 and told Hearsum if she behaved herself until then, he would not jail her. Mr O'Brien reminded the court of Hearsum's original offence when she asked the victim to visit her and then tried to coax her into bed before stripping off and throttling her. Hearsum held the woman prisoner in her home for over an hour and threatened her with a knife. At last year's hearing she admitted falsely imprisoning the woman on July 29, 2014 and sexually assaulting her by penetrating her v****a with her finger. She also admitted assaulting the woman by beating and she pleaded guilty to harassing her after the incident by sending numerous texts and Facebook messages which became increasingly intimidating. Prosecutor Julian Kesner told the court last year that Hearsum had rung her friend - who had a boyfriend - last July because she wanted to talk about problems in her relationship. The pair went to the pub and returned to Hearsum's home at 9pm, but the victim went to use the bathroom, she noticed the front door had been locked from the inside and the key was missing. The woman told Hearsum she had to go home, but Hearsum replied that she was 'not going anywhere'. Mr Kesner said: ''She repeatedly asked the victim to stay the night and go to bed with her. Her repeated invitations were declined. 'The defendant was acting in a bizarre way. She took all her clothes off and asked the lady for a kiss. This was again declined.' But the judge at Gloucester Crown Court told Hearsum she would be spared jail again if she could 'behave' until July . The court heard how things 'degenerated' after that, with Hearsum attempting to strangle the victim and punching her around the head. The victim then managed to use her phone to contact her boyfriend on Facebook, who called the police. She was sentenced to two years prison suspended for two years, placed under supervision for the same period, and given the restraining order. The defendant was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for 10 years. Today, Tim Burrows, defending, said: 'She has been using alcohol in excess and that was fuelling the messages she started sending. It got to the point where she was almost inviting the victim to call the police and get her arrested. 'Despite these breaches she has continued to engage with her supervising officer and has been extremely open with him about her behaviour and why it has taken place. 'She has also been to her GP and Turning Point to try to deal with the emotions she has. Her supervisor is anxious to continue to work with her. There has been no further contact with the victim since these breaches. She has changed her medication. 'I urge you to consider it would be unjust to activate the suspended sentence. I have to admit she has not behaved well and that she was told of the consequences if she failed to comply. ' Judge William Hart told Hearsum her messages had been 'unpleasant and scary' but he had decided to give her a final chance to obey the order and the terms of her sentence. He deferred sentence on her till 15th June and said if she behaved herself till then and complied fully with the order he would not jail her.","Jesamine Hearsum, 32, beat, strangled and sexually assaulted her victim .

"A man whose girlfriend ran off with his stepfather and gave birth to a baby nearly four years ago has spoken of his delight after DNA tests proved the baby is actually his. Love rat Stan Crowther, 47, and Rachel Delaney, 18 at the time, set up home together and Rachel then gave birth to a baby daughter,  whom Stan believed was his. But recent bombshell DNA tests showed that the baby, living in Chorley, Lancashire, actually belongs to her former partner, and Stan's former stepson, Ashley Mercer, 27. Ashley Mercer (left, pictured in 2010) was heartbroken when his girlfriend Rachel Delaney began an affair with his stepfather Stan Crowther (both pictured right). Rachel had a baby shortly after moving in with Stan and recent DNA tests have proved that the child is in fact Ashley's . Stan Crowther, 47, with the baby daughter he believed was his until recent DNA tests proved otherwise . The affair between Stan and Rachel shattered Ashley and his mother, Mandy, who has astonishingly now forgiven Stan for the affair. Mandy, 47, who has now found new love with partner Andy Barker, says: 'It's been a rollercoaster few years. It might sound funny, but I'm happier now than I've ever been before. 'I have forgiven Stan. We're friends again. And my son has moved on with his life too and has a new daughter to be proud of.' Both men were left reeling from results of DNA tests which show that Ashley - and not Stan - is the father of Rachel's daughter. Ashley says: 'I feel very bitter towards Stan. I trusted him, I used to call him dad and I can't forgive him like my mum has. 'I'm buzzing to find out I am the baby's dad - and Stan isn't.' Love rat Stan with Ashley's mother Mandy Rourke, 47, whom he was married to for ten years . Ashley Mercer was in a relationship with Rachel's sister Kelly before he met Rachel, and the pair have a son, pictured, now seven . Kelly Delaney, Rachel's sister, with her son with Ashley . Ashley has five children with five different women - including a son with Rachel's sister Kelly. He started seeing Kelly when he was 19, and their son is now seven. But they split when he was three years old. Ashley was single for just three months before he moved on from Kelly to her half-sister, Rachel, in 2010. Rachel, then 16, began working at the family firm: a Lancashire tattoo parlour. Ashley says: 'Rachel was very similar to her sister, but she was naughty. We had a lot of fun together.' Rachel soon became part of the family and Ashley's mother, Mandy, grew fond of her. But Ashley began to suspect an affair between Rachel and his stepfather Stan, confiding in Mandy, who at first dismissed the idea as outrageous. Rachel and Stan when they first got together: Their relationship fizzled out 18 months later and DNA tests have now proved that Ashley is the baby's biological father . Stan and Rachel  set up home together, and Rachel then gave birth to a baby daughter, whom Stan believed was his . Ashley says: 'I saw them in the car together, play fighting, but then they were getting too cosy. 'I was sickened. Stan and my mum had been married for ten years and I called him dad. He was my father figure.' Horrified by her son's claims, Mandy turned detective and began checking the mobile phone belonging to the tattoo parlour - which Rachel took home with her each night. She says: 'The account was in my name and I checked her bill and Stan's. Stan was sending loads of texts. 'I spoke to Stan and he became very defensive and shifty and I knew, instantly, there was something going on.' She confronted Rachel and found intimate text messages between her and Stan. Horrified, she threw Stan out and Ashley finished with Rachel. Mandy, 47, has found new love with partner, Andy Barker . Mandy (pictured with new partner Andy) says: 'I was furious that Stan had betrayed me. But it hurt even more that he had betrayed Ashley' Mandy says: 'Ashley was gutted. He hadn't wanted to believe it. He stopped eating and he started drinking heavily. 'He'd had a stammer as a kid, but it came back much worse. I was really worried about him. 'I was furious that Stan had betrayed me. But it hurt even more that he had betrayed Ashley.' Rachel then announced she was pregnant. Mandy says: 'At first she said it was Ashley's baby, then she said it was Stan's. It was disgusting. Poor Ashley was totally up the wall.' Rachel eventually announced that the baby, born in March 2011, was Stan's, and the couple set up home together. It was the last straw for Mandy, who filed for divorce. Mandy (pictured with younger son Josh, now 19) turned detective and began checking the mobile phone belonging to the tattoo parlour, which she ran with Stan . Mandy (left) says: 'I spoke to Stan and he became very defensive and shifty and I knew, instantly, there was something going on'; Right: Rachel pictured in 2010 . But Rachel and Stan's relationship fizzled out 18 months later and DNA tests have now proved that Ashley is the baby's biological father. Ashley is now is a new relationship with partner, Deanne Parry. The couple are planning to get engaged and he has contact with Rachel's daughter. Perhaps most surprising of all, Stan and Mandy are friends again, though she vows she will never forgive Rachel. Mandy says: 'There's no relationship there, but Stan and I are friends. For a long time, I was angry and bitter. But life is too short for that.' Rachel says: 'I wanted the baby to be Stan's. But deep down, I knew there was a chance Ashley was the dad. 'I didn't want my little girl going to school and not knowing who her dad was. I paid for the DNA test. Ashley didn't pay a penny. I am not sure whether I will put his name on the birth certificate. He needs to step up as a dad.' Stan has since moved away to start a new life and says: 'I am heartbroken. I thought that little girl was mine and the DNA results were devastating. I don't see Rachel any more. 'I regret the way I treated Mandy, and we are friends again now. I wish things had happened differently but I just have to get on and start again.'","Ashley Mercer was 22 when he discovered his girlfriend Rachel Delaney, 18, was having an affair with his stepfather Stan Crowther, 43 .

"David Cameron has pledged to offer MPs a vote on repealing the fox hunting ban if he wins the election and declared that he has the ‘countryside in my blood’. In an article for the Countryside Alliance magazine the Prime Minister makes a direct pitch to rural voters, insisting he understands their concerns and is proud of the country’s ‘rural identity’. He also points to his own ‘rural heritage’ and writes of feeling ‘most at home’ in the countryside, enjoying country walks and bike rides with his family and feeding the animals ‘at the next door farm’. The Prime Minister - at a hat factory in his Witney constituency today - has made a direct pitch to rural voters, insisting he understands their concerns and is proud of the country’s ‘rural identity’ And he says he makes political decisions ‘while tending my muddy veg patch.’ Mr Cameron says there is a ‘rural way of life which a born and bred Londoner might struggle to understand’ and spells out his personal opposition to the hunting ban. ‘I have always been a strong supporter of country sports. It is my firm belief that people should have the freedom to hunt, so I share the frustration that many people feel about the Hunting Act and the way it was brought in by the last government.’ ‘The Hunting Act has done nothing for animal welfare. A Conservative government will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal the Hunting Act on a free vote, with a government bill in government time.’ The pledge mirrors that made in the last Tory manifesto in 2010. Early last year, Mr Cameron admitted he had been forced to abandon any attempt to relax the law on hunting with dogs. The Lib Dems opposed the change as did a small number of Tory MPs known as ‘Blue Foxes’. Ministers concluded that any vote would likely to fail in the Commons and so set back the cause. Hunting foxes and other wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales was banned by Labour in 2004. In the article, Mr Cameron says he feels most at home in the countryside having been brought up in the village of Peasemore in Berkshire. He says he feels a ‘noticeable emotional shift’ when he arrives in his West Oxfordshire constituency on Friday after a week in London. David Cameron has pledged to offer MPs a vote on repealing the fox hunting ban if he wins the election and declared that he has the ‘countryside in my blood’ ‘We spend a lot of time outdoors as a family: walking, running, gardening, cycling and riding. We all help feed the animals at the next door farm and eagerly anticipate lambing time each year. Decisions get mulled over while tending my muddy veg patch.’ And he writes of his family’s ‘annual pilgrimage’ to North Cornwall ‘a place I’ve been going to even since I was a child’. ‘It feels only right that Truro hospital was where our youngest daughter, Florence, was born, cementing Cornwall in our family history.’ ‘Walking the coastal paths, fishing off the Doom Bar at low tide, or having a barbecue at Daymer Bay, looking across the estuary towards Padstow: this is the stuff that memories are made of.’ The Tories are hopeful of picking up several seats in the South West of England from the Lib Dems. Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘With Britain facing a cost-of-living crisis because of his failing plan, David Cameron’s continued focus on fox hunting shows how out of touch he is. ‘The Tories should get over their narrow obsession with fox hunting and accept that Labour’s ban is widely supported.’ Tim Bonner, director of campaigns for the Countryside Alliance, said: ‘The Hunting Act has failed and there is a clear need to revisit it, so we welcome David Cameron's pledge of a free vote on its repeal.’ Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports said: ‘The Hunting Act is a testimony to the fact that we are a nation of animal lovers and we have an international reputation for our hatred of cruelty in the name of sport.’","PM said he had the 'countryside in my blood' in love letter to rural voters .

"The tail fin of a German plan that was flown during the Second World War by the world's deadliest-ever fighter pilot is to go up for auction. The bullet-ridden section of the Messerschmitt is covered with stencil paintings of the 121 British and Commonwealth aircraft shot down by Luftwaffe pilot Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer. It was discovered by a military-air historian in the 1960s, who spotted the unique artifact being used to patch up a roof in the village of Hillegossen, Germany. Scroll down for video . Deadly aim: The bullet-ridden section of the Messerschmitt (right) is covered with stencil paintings of the 121 British and Commonwealth aircraft shot down by Luftwaffe pilot Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer (left) Targets: Night pilot Schnaufer shot down the Allied aircraft - costing some 500 lives - on 164 operations between 1 June 1942 and 7 March 1945. Above, a Messerschmitt similar to the one flown by Schnaufer . Wolfgang Lohmann, an expert on Luftwaffe aircraft, bought the fin from its  owner - who had picked it out of wreckage after the war - and has had it on display at his home in Germany ever since. The fin, which also features a large swastika, could fetch up to £20,000 when it goes up for sale in May. Night pilot Schnaufer shot down the Allied planes - costing some 500 lives - on 164 operations between 1 June 1942 and 7 March 1945. He marked each 'kill' by printing an icon of his target on the  tail fin of his plane, each accompanied with the date it was destroyed. Nicknamed 'The Spook of St Trond', after the city where he was based in occupied Belgium, he is one of only 27 men awarded the Knights Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. His plane was finally shot down on March 30, 1945, but Schnaufer was not on board. The pilot died in 1950 following a road accident. Record: Schnaufer marked each 'kill' by printing an icon of his target on the tail fin of his plane, each accompanied with the date it was destroyed, pictured above. They were stenciled over a large swastika . Honoured: Luftwaffe ace Schnaufer (second left) recieves the Oak Leaves with Swords, Germany's highest military decoration at the time, from from Adolf Hitler. He is one of only 27 men who received the award . Chris Albury, a senior auctioneer at Dominic Winter Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucester, where the fin will be auctioned on May 15, said: 'We have not had a Messerschmitt tail fin like this before. 'Obviously this one is more than any other - it is unique. It makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. It makes you feel very close to the Second World War. 'We have put it up in the foyer in a low key fashion. It's caused quite a few comments. So many people have relatives or ancestors with a connection in the Second World War. 'I don't think this is as controversial a piece as some Nazi memorabilia can be. If it was the other way around there wouldn't be any controversy. 'It just happens to be a German aircraft. This is history - this is real. The fact that he had to shoot down 120 planes is just part of the story.' Decorated: Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer . Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer is considered the deadliest-ever fighter pilot - claiming more victories than the Red Baron. He shot down 121 aircraft during the Second World War. Most of them were four-engined British bombers, such as the Lancaster. The night pilot was nicknamed 'The Spook of St. Trond', after the location of his unit's base in occupied Belgium, from where he would fly out to intercept bombing attacks. Born in Calw, Schnaufer achieved his 100th aerial victory on 9 October 1944 and was awarded the Diamonds to his Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 16 October. He is one of only 27 men to have received the award, at the time Germany's highest military decoration. By the end of the war, Schnaufer's night fighter crew held the unique distinction that every member was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Schnaufer was taken prisoner of war by British forces in May 1945. After his release a year later, he returned to his home town and took over the family wine business. The pilot died in 1950 following a road accident.","Luftwaffe pilot Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer shot down 121 planes in WW2 .

"Seven people in their early 20s have been injured - at least three, critically - after being shot multiple times by a gunman during a spring break party on the Florida Panhandle, police have said. The unsuspecting revelers were shot in the head, neck, chest and other areas at the house party in Panama City Beach in the early hours of Saturday. Multiple 911 calls flooded in just before 1am, . Deputies arriving on the scene found a sprawling crime scene with victims inside the home, outside and across the street from it, and in the street's median, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said. Shortly after, a suspect matching witnesses' descriptions - David Jamichael Daniels, 22 - was arrested near the Gulf Of Mexico. He has since been charged with seven counts of attempted murder. In custody: David Jamichael Daniels, 22, of Mobile, Alabama, was arrested over the shooting Saturday . Victim: Tykeria Ethridge, 22, was shot in the neck and shoulder, and posted a photo from her hospital bed (right), saying she was 'just an innocent person like everybody else' Daniels, who is from Mobile, Alabama, is now in custody awaiting his first court appearance. After arriving on the scene on Saturday morning, Officers immediately set up a perimeter. A .40-caliber handgun believed to have been used was found in the yard of a nearby home. The sheriff's office said several of the victims were students from Alabama A&M University in Panama City Beach for spring break. At least three were critically injured: Kearria Freed, 20, who was shot in the head; Devanta Moore, 21, who was shot in the chest; and Henton Franklin, 22, who was shot in the side.

"Canadian police have charged a pet store owner with criminal negligence causing death after a 4-year-old boy and his 6-year-old brother were asphyxiated by a 100-pound python. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced the charge against Jean-Claude Savoie, 38, Tuesday. Noah Barthe, 4, and Connor Barthe, 6, were found dead on the morning of August 5, 2013, after an African rock python escaped its glass enclosure inside Savoie's apartment in Campbellton, New Brunswick, where the boys were staying for a sleepover. Scroll down for video . Death by python: Jean-Claude Savoie (left) with criminal negligence causing death after Noah and Connor Barthe (right), ages 4 and 6, were asphyxiated by his 100-pound python . Scene: The boys had been staying in the apartment above Reptile Ocean, a pet shop in the small city of Campbellton in New Brunswick, Canada . Suspected culprit: This African Rock Python is pictured on Jean-Claude Savoie's Facebook and could be the one that killed the boys as they slept . Police said at the time that the 14-foot-long snake slithered through a ventilation pipe. Its weight caused the pipe to collapse, and it fell into the living room where the boys were sleeping. Autopsies concluded that Noah and Connor died from asphyxiation. Savoie's son, who was sleeping in a different room, was not harmed. 'This was a unique case in Canada and required consultation with experts familiar with African rock pythons,' Constable Jullie Rogers-Marsh said in a press release. 'In addition, as is common in major investigations, a thorough review was conducted of the evidence and investigational steps. That review determined there was sufficient evidence to lay a charge.' Savoie is due back in court April 27. If convicted, he could face up to a life in prison. Connor and Noah (right and left) were the sons of Savoie's best friend, Mandy Trecartin (center) Tragic: Connor and Noah Barth are seen here with a third child as they mop out a massive glass enclosure that held some of Jean-Claude Savoie's large reptiles . The two little boys are seen here playing in the sand it a smaller snake enclosure . Strangled: Autopsies concluded that Noah and Connor died from asphyxiation . Savoie said earlier that when he found the boys, he initially thought they were sleeping, but they never woke up . The Royal Canadian Mounted Police completed their investigation in July 2014, but Savoie was not arrested until February. He was later released from custody. At the time of the tragic incident, Daily Mail Online spoke to a reptile expert briefed by police who said that the snake had escaped from its enclosure before and was 'an accident waiting to happen'. 'This was preventable, if the snake had been kept safe and secure,' Bry Loyst, curator of the Indian River Reptile Zoo in Ottowa, told Daily Mail. The two boys spent August 5, 203, with Savoie and his son, swimming, barbecuing and playing with rabbits and other animals at a farm. Connor and Noah were the sons of Savoie's best friend, Mandy Trecartin. A private zoo owner told Daily Mail Savoie’s python could have been attracted to the two boys because of the scent of animals on their bodies from the farm visit. Serpent: This anaconda is believed to be one of the very large snakes Jean-Claude Savoie kept at his Reptile Ocean pet shop . Outlawed: African rock pythons like this one have been banned in New Brunswick since 1992 unless a permit is obtained . Scaly: Officers seized a total of 27 animals from Savoie's store, including two crocodiles . 'Sadly, the snake could have mistaken them for a food item, which they weren't', the owner of Little Ray's Zoo in Ottowa said at the time. In a tragic twist of fate, the two boys would have usually spent Saturday and Sunday with their dad - but he was out of town on a trip to Boston with his two older daughters from a previous marriage. Jean-Claude Savoie earlier described how he found the boys at 6.30am on August 5 and at first thought the boys were just sleeping. 'They were sleeping,' he said in an interview. But 'they didn't even open their eyes or nothing. I thought they were sleeping until I [saw] the hole in the ceiling. I turned the lights on and I [saw] this horrific scene.' He explained: '[The snake] went through a ventilation system. I don't understand how it did it. It went through the ceiling... and the snake fell into the living room from the ceiling.' Noah and Connor were supposed to spend the weekend in early August 2013 with their father - Mandy Trecartin's (left) ex-boyfriend - but he was away on a trip and her friend Savoie (right) invited them other for a sleepover . Prey: A reptile expert said the python may have mistaken the children for food because they had spent the day on a farm interacting with various animals . Together forever: The two inseparable siblings have been laid to rest in one casket . Savoie said that after finding the boys' bodies, he discovered the snake coiled in a hole nearby, held it down and put it in a cage. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police later ordered the python destroyed. During the investigation, they seized a total of 27 exotic animals from Savoie’s pet store. A reptile expert who came in contact with the python six weeks before the tragedy said it was 'vicious' and nervous around people. As the case unfolded, photos emerged showing little Connor and Noah Barthe scrubbing out the cage believed to have housed the snake that strangled them in their sleep. The pictures of the shirtless boys, age 4 and 6, in their underwear were posted on their mother's Facebook page. Ms Trecartin also posted a picture of the children playing in a smaller glass cage at the pet store-cum-apartment in Campellton, New Brunswick, Canada. Savoie could face up to a life in prison if convicted in the deaths of Noah and Connor, pictured left and right with their mother . African rock pythons have been banned in New Brunswick since 1992 unless a permit is obtained. Only accredited zoos can secure such a permit. Attacks by African rock pythons are rare, but not unheard of. The last was in 2002, when a 10-year-old boy was killed and swallowed in Durban, South Africa. Three years prior, a three-year-old boy was killed by another rock python after escaping its cage in Centralia, Illinois.","Noah and Connor Barthe, 4 and 6, died August 5, 2013, after African rock python escaped glass tank inside Jean-Claude Savoie's home .

"Jim Davidson has never been one to shy away from controversy. So it's perhaps no surprise that the comedian looked right at home as he hobnobbed with Nigel Farage during a plush charity ball in London last night. The Celebrity Big Brother winner spent time chatting and sharing several jokes with the UKIP leader at the inaugural Care for Combat ball at the Dorchester Hotel. Even Davidson's wife appeared to have been taken in by the politician's charm, happily posing for photos with the UKIP leader during the event. Scroll down for video . Double act: Jim Davidson shakes hands with  Nigel Farage at the inaugural Care for Combat ball held last night at the upmarket Dorchester Hotel in London . Controversial: The comedian and his wife Michelle Cotton posed for photos with the UKIP leader . Hobknobbing: The trio were attending the inaugural ball for the charity set up last year by Davidson . Michelle Cotton, who wore a floor-length red dress to the do, even stepped onto the dance floor with the politician for a slow dance at the end of the night. Farage, who donned a polka dot pink bow tie, attended the event alongside a host of other celebrities to raise money for the armed forces charity, which was set up by Davidson last year. They included charity spokesman Casey Batchelor and Luisa Zissman, both of whom are also part of the Celebrity Big Brother alumni. EastEnders actresses Barbara Windsor and Gillian Telforth were also seen at the event. Last night's united front was not the first time Davidson and Farage have publicly appeared to join forces. In an interview earlier this year, Davidson described UKIP as 'the Jim Davidson of the political world'. He told Digital Spy that he 'felt for UKIP'. He also revealed that Farage was one of the first people to phone him following his acquittal over sex allegations. Speaking at the time, he said: 'I got a call from the Ukip leader, who I had never spoken to before, saying, ""All right Jim, Nigel Farage, I hope you don't mind, I got your number from your agent. ""I just wanted to say bloody good news, fantastic, marvellous, I never believed a bloody word of it, all the best"" and hung up. 'I could not believe it, what a nice guy!' The UKIP leader (left and right) was pulling his classic grinning expression as he stopped and chatted in a polka dot pink bow tie and a smart black suit . The comedian was first arrested in January 2013 by detectives from Operation Yewtree, which was set up after the Jimmy Savile scandal. He was re-arrested two months later after more women came forward. He faced 10 allegations, all of which he denied, and all involving adults dating back up to 35 years. He was then cleared in August 2013 after the CPS ruled there was 'insufficient evidence'. Even before his arrest, Davidson's brand of comedy divided TV fans in the past. The former Big Break frontman has been forced to defend his sense of humour on a number of occasions. The politician, who launched his election campaign earlier this week, shared a dance with Ms Cotton . He also appeared to be having a ball with Davidson's wife, Michelle Cotton, at last night's event . Last year, he said in an interview: If I cured Aids and fed Africa and ended Ebola and found that missing aeroplane I'd still be that horrible racist, sexist, homophobic comedian. By people, with respect, who haven't seen me. Or are judging me from the past.' During his time on 'CBB', he also provoked plenty of controversy, but eventually went on to win the show. Meanwhile, Farage was yesterday at the White Cliffs of Dover to launch his election campaign, which focuses heavily on immigration. The Care After Combat charity works to help servicemen and women when they return to civilian life. Their mission statement explains that they work 'to help to maintain and promote camaraderie in the Veterans community for those feeling vulnerable or at unrest with society.' It adds: 'We look to provide professional assistance where possible for the well-being of the Veteran and their family.'","Pair chatted at Care for Combat charity ball at Dorchester Hotel, London .

"Avian cholera is thought to have killed at least 2,000 snow geese that fell dead from the sky in Idaho while migrating to nesting grounds on the northern coast of Alaska, wildlife managers said Monday. Dozens of Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) workers and volunteers over the weekend retrieved and incinerated carcasses of snow geese found near bodies of water and a wildlife management area in the eastern part of the state, said agency spokesman Gregg Losinski. Illness? Avian cholera is suspected in the deaths of at least 2,000 snow geese that fell dead from the sky in Idaho, like the one seen here . Avian cholera is believed to be the culprit in the deaths mostly because of the way the birds died, he said. 'Basically, they just fell out of the sky,' Losinski said. He said biologists were awaiting results from a state wildlife lab to confirm the birds died of the highly contagious disease, which is caused by bacteria that can survive in soil and water for up to four months. Humans face a small risk of contracting the disease but the more immediate threat is to wildlife in the vicinity of contaminated carcasses, Losinski said. About 20 bald eagles were seen near areas where snow geese carcasses littered the ground but a lengthy incubation period makes it unclear if the eagles were infected and would carry the ailment elsewhere, said Losinski. It was not known where the snow geese – named for their white plumage and for breeding in the far northern corners of Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Siberia – contracted avian cholera during a migration that saw them wing north from wintering grounds in the American Southwest and Mexico, he said. Outbreaks like the one found affecting the migrating snow geese in Idaho occur periodically in the United States and elsewhere, Losinski said. Loskinki said in a Monday news release 'The carcasses of a small number of snow geese were first reported at Camas National Wildlife Refuge near Dubois, Idaho. Closer inspection on Friday found higher numbers of dead birds at the Mud Lake WMA Area near Terreton, Idaho and a lesser amount at Market Lake WMA near Roberts, Idaho.' Upper Snake Regional Supervisor Steve Schmidt said in the release that avian cholera has appeared before. 'Outbreaks of avian cholera have occurred sporadically in the region over the past few decades,' he said. Schmidt also said that 'The important thing is to quickly collect as many of the carcasses as possible, to prevent other birds from feeding on the infected birds.' The IDFG said anyone who sees dead birds should not touch them, and contact the Upper Snake Regional Office by dialing 208-525-7290. Avian cholera is the most important infectious disease affecting wild waterfowl in North America, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 'Death may be so rapid that birds literally fall out of the sky or die while eating with no previous signs of disease,' the agency said of the disease on its website. 'Sick birds appear lethargic, and when captured may die within minutes.' It said that infected birds may swim in circles, experience convulsions, swim in circles, fly upside down, exhibit mucous discharge from their mouths, have blood-stained or yellow droppings, and display soiled or matted feathers on parts of the body.

"The women's liberation movement didn't just change the role of women in society, it also helped transform what appeared on family dinner plates. Food historian Dr Polly Russell told today's This Morning that in the Fifties, only 20 per cent of women worked, leaving the majority of wives to spend their time cooking, cleaning and managing their households. But in later decades as women swelled the workforce, convenient pre-prepared sandwiches, microwaves and ready meals transformed Britain's kitchens - and its diet. Scroll down for video . Food in the Fifties as illustrated by this display on today's This Morning. Housewives had to feed the family with limited rations . Thanks to households being rationed to one egg per week, cakes like this one, right, had to be made with dried eggs, left, while they were topped with blancmange thanks to the lack of sugar available . The Robshaw family try making a Fifties cake with limited ingredients on BBC show 'Back in Time for Dinner', ably assisted by Mary Berry . She told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'We have this idea of the Fifties being a domestic ideal - Mad Men, glamorous -  this was not the case in Britain, we were still in rationing, very austere. 'It meant there was only one fresh egg a week per household so housewives had to feed the family with these limited rations. 'It's not surprising housewives became fed-up in the Fifties - they spent 75 hours a week doing housework.' 'They had to cope with powdered eggs and a limited amount of variety to cook with.' A new BBC series called Back In Time For Dinner challenged a modern family to try reliving what this was like. The Robshaws - father Brandon, mother Rochelle and children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15, and Fred 10 - learnt that rations certainly made birthdays less indulgent. Food historian Dr Polly Russell, pictured, took Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on a trip down memory lane for the taste buds on today's This Morning, showing what was typically eaten from the Fifties to Nineties . The Robshaw family took on a brave culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in every decade from the Fifties to the Nineties. Pictured, from left to right, Rosalind, 15, mum Rochelle, Fred, 10, dad Brandon and Miranda, 17, in the Fifties episode . Dr Russell invited Amanda and Phillip to try a birthday cake the family made on the show based on a Fifties recipe. She explained: 'A cake had to be made with dry eggs and icing with a blancmange topping because of the lack of sugar. ' After a taste test, Amanda admitted it was 'dry but not inedible'. Bread and dripping (often leftover fat from the Sunday roast) was a common reality at breakfast time while fresh vegetables were often taken from community allotments. In the Sixties, This Morning illustrated how a typical food spread would include cheese and pineapples on cocktails sticks and corned beef. Dr Russell revealed how this was the decade when kitchens were transformed by technology. She said: 'In the Sixties there was a real rise in disposable incomes and an increase technology in the kitchen. In the Sixties, food became more colourful and decorative, as shown by the cheese and pineapple sticks served on an orange and vibrant table cloth on today's This Morning . The Hairy Bikers' Dave Myers pictured with the Robshaw family as they sample the food of the Sixties . 'The most iconic piece is the fridge but only 50 per cent of households had one by the end of the decade, everyone else used larders. The fridge changed what you could cook.' The food historian added that food at this time became 'more about display and what it looks like as well as what it tastes like.' So along with the decorative pineapple and cheese on sticks served attached to an orange, came colourful dishes like vegetable terrines. By the Seventies, 40 per cent of women were working, leading to a rise in the number of convenience foods on offer. Dr Russell explained: 'Now women have less time for cooking so the food industry starts offering help in terms of processed, convenience foods so there are things like Pot Noodles available. 'There's also more branding and colourful packaging to try and persuade people to buy them.' By the Seventies, with more women going out to work, food is becoming more convenient with products like Angel Delight, back left, and ready-made cake mixtures, back right . Arctic rolls and Pot Noodles became popular in the Seventies as people spent less time cooking . Children of the Seventies loved Angel Delight, chocolate, strawberry and butterscotch flavours pictured . Iced fingers and ready-made Arctic Rolls were the desserts of choice during this decade but every child's favourite sweet treat was Angel Delight. The product was purchased as a powder so could be whipped up in seconds by time-strapped working mothers. Such convenience foods became even more popular in the Eighties as the number of women working increased again. 'There was a more disposable income and less time so the ready-meal industry steps up and we get the microwave,' Dr Russell explained. In the Eighties, the invention of the microwave led to a rise in ready-meals while pre-packed sandwiches, bottom right, appeared on shelves for the first time as workers wanted to grab lunch and go . The Robshaw family, pictured in their 1980s-style kitchen which was all about convenience, with gadgets aplenty helping them to make meals . She added that the pre-packed sandwich we take for granted today only came in to fruition in 1981 'marking our changing relationship with time and leisure' as people would rather grab lunch and go than do a home-made packed lunch. The first flavours for pre-packed sandwiches included cheese and pickle and tinned salmon and tomato. Following the rise of convenience foods came concerns for health in the Nineties. But Dr Russell admits this was a contradictory time, when the nation had a 'schizophrenic relationship with food'. While families tried to be healthier by opting for organic foods and aiming for their 'five-a-day' they were also bombarded with high sugar, processed foods like Pop Tarts and Mr Kipling snack cakes. In the Nineties, people became more health conscious opting for salad and organic foods but at the same time, high sugar, processed foods like Pop Tarts were introduced .

"A mother has described how her teenage son woke from a coma addicted to cheese and compulsively swearing. Kai Thomas, 15, suffered a sudden, potentially life-threatening brain bleed in June last year. He had surgery to relieve pressure on his brain and doctors at Sheffield Children's Hospital put him in a coma for nine days so he could recover. When he woke up he was unable to move or speak, a result of the trauma his brain had endured. While he has since regained the ability to walk and talk again, Kai has been left with some unusual side-effects. He has become so addicted to cheese that he munches on several blocks of it a day - and even puts it on his cereal. And  previously well-mannered, he now regularly swears, to his mother's horror. Kai Thomas, 15, suffered a sudden, potentially life-threatening brain bleed in June last year. Since then, he has become 'addicted' to cheese and swears profusely . His mother Tracey, of Chesterfield, said: 'He's addicted to cheese – and he can't stop swearing.' The 35-year-old explained that before falling ill,  Kai was a good-natured, well-manned young man. 'He didn't swear and minded his manners,' she said. 'Then in June last year, he came home from school rubbing his head and saying it hurt. Then he suddenly collapsed.' Mrs Thomas called 999 and Kai was taken to Sheffield Children's Hospital. 'Doctors carried out scans and the results showed a bleed on the brain,' she said. 'They told me it could have just come out the blue or he could have knocked himself.' Kai spent six hours in theatre where surgeons battled to save his life. Thankfully, doctors were able to stabilise his condition - and they put him in a coma to give his body a chance to recover. Nine days later he woke up. 'His face was blank and he couldn't speak,' said Mrs Thomas. 'Doctors said the trauma of the bleed and subsequent surgery had caused him to regress. He'd also lost his power of speech and movement.' To her relief, his condition gradually began to improve - and a few weeks later he started speaking again. Last September, he finally got to go home - but there was more drama to come. Mrs Thomas said: 'One day I was in the kitchen, when I heard Kai yelling in his bedroom. 'He was screaming ""F***, b******, s***"". 'I wondered what on earth was going on - the expletives were coming thick and fast.' Kai's mother, Tracey,  said while he always liked cheese, her son has now become 'obsessed' with it - even putting it on his cereal. His mild-mannered temperament has also been replaced with aggression . Experts say every patient reacts differently. 'No two cases are the same and there can be physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioural problems as a result of a head injury,' said a brain charity spokesman . Upon going upstairs to see what was happening, she found Kai munching on an entire block of cheese. Then, over the next few weeks, she noticed all types of cheese going missing from the fridge. 'He had always like cheese but now he was obsessed with it - he even added it to his cereal,' said Mrs Thomas.

Catherine Weingarten (pictured) and the group Endangered Bodies were behind the petition . Weingarten wrote on the petition's page 'Scrolling through Facebook the other day, I saw a friend’s status set to ""feeling fat,"" accompanied by an emoji with chubby cheeks and a double chin. I think it was supposed to be funny, but seeing this status made me feel angry. 'As someone who has struggled with and overcome disordered eating, I know what it’s like to ""feel"" fat. I have spent years of my life consumed with negative thoughts about my body, and far too many days starving myself in an effort to lose weight. But even worse than the skipped meals and the hours spent obsessing in front of the mirror was the fear of what others thought about me and my body.

'When Facebook users set their status to ""feeling fat,"" they are making fun of people who consider themselves to be overweight, which can include many people with eating disorders. That is not ok. Join me in asking Facebook to remove the ""fat"" emoji from their status options.' In an interview with ABC News, Weingarten said: 'I think we all need to be a little more careful about how we talk about their bodies and learn how to use a more body positive vocabulary,' she told the news outlet. Facebook said in a statement to ABC News that 'People use Facebook to share their feelings with friends and support each other. One option we give people to express themselves is to add a feeling to their posts.

"The Obama administration has put the brakes on its plans to ban a popular type of rifle ammunition after an onslaught of criticism from both the public and lawmakers. 'You spoke, we listened,' the agency said Tuesday afternoon on Twitter. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the agency received more than 80,000 public comments on the proposal to outlaw some types of 5.56 mm rounds – also known as .223 caliber ammunition. The agency said Tuesday that comments ran overwhelmingly against the proposal, which it first floated in February. The ammunition targeted by the ATF is commonly known as 'green-tip' because of its distinctive appearance. GREEN-TIP: The popular rifle ammunition is no longer being targeted for extinction by the ATF . Hunters and target shooters use the bullets, primarily in AR-15-style rifles like this one, but the ammo could travel fast enough from a handgun to pierce a police officer's body armor . UNCLE: The ATF decided Tuesday that it couldn't withstand an onslaught from legislators and the public . 'Although ATF endeavored to create a proposal that reflected a good faith interpretation of the law and balanced the interests of law enforcement, industry, and sportsmen, the vast majority of the comments received to date are critical of the framework, and include issues that deserve further study,' the agency said in a press release. 'Accordingly, ATF will not at this time seek to issue a final framework.' That carefully parsed language leaves open the possibility that the government could revive the idea in the future. The ATF plans to keep collecting comments until March 16. Hundreds of lawmakers, including 52 U.S. senators, also objected. The ATF had proposed banning the ammunition, most commonly used in the popular AR-15-style rifles, because they could potentially penetrate a police officer's protective vest if fired from a handgun instead. The Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act banned armor-piercing handgun ammunition in 1986. Green-tip ammo has long been exempt because it's primarily used in hunting and target-shooting rifles. The ATF's proposal would have removed that exemption, effectively banning its sale in the United States. Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte took a rhetorical victory lap on Tuesday from his perch as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. 'After much pressure from a large, bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives, I am pleased that the Obama Administration has abandoned its attack on the Second Amendment,' Goodlatte said in a statement. 'It is entirely inappropriate for President Obama to stretch his regulatory authority to implement partisan policies that Congress has refused to enact,' he added. 'Such an abuse of power would impact many law-abiding gun owners and restrict the American people's ability to legally and responsibly exercise their Second Amendment rights.' Last week Goodlatte and 238 other House members, including seven Democrats, sent a verbal stop sign to the ATF. 'Under no circumstances should ATF adopt a standard that will ban ammunition that is overwhelmingly used by law-abiding Americans for legitimate purposes,' the lawmakers wrote to ATF Director B. Todd Jones. On Monday a group of 53 Republican senators complained in a similar letter to Jones that efforts to respect the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution – which protects the 'right to bear arms' – 'require not only access to firearms, but to bullets.' 'If law-abiding gun owners cannot obtain rifle ammunition, or face substantial difficulty in finding ammunition available and at reasonable prices because government entities are banning such ammunition, then the Second Amendment is at risk,' they claimed. Only one GOP senator, Mark Kirk of Illinois, chose not to sign the letter. He faces a brutal re-election fight next year in a blue state where gun control advocates have a strong presence. The National Rifle Association also claimed victory on Tuesday. 'VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMMENTS ... ARE CRITICAL': ATF's message to Americans admitted that hardly anyone supported them . The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is a Justice Department agency in charge of regulating access to a wide variety of materials . Rifle owners complained that without the green-tip ammo, their guns could become useless overnight . 'Today's announcement proves what we have said all along – this was 100% political,' NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said in a statement. 'President Obama failed to pass gun control through Congress, so he tried impose his political agenda through executive fiat. But every gun owner in America needs to understand Barack Obama's hatred of the Second Amendment has not changed.' The nation's largest gun-rights group is preparing for its annual convention next month in Nashville, Tennessee, where potential presidential candidates including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former FLorida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will rally thousands of the Second Amendment lobby's backers. The controversy has also brought a legislative brickbat out of the House, with Florida Republican Rep. Tom Rooney introducing the Protecting Second Amendment Rights Act. That bill proposed to generally limit the ATF's power to regulate ammunition. Speaking of Tuesday's resolution, Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady said: 'This was way out of step with reality and I’m glad it’s over.'","'Green-tip' bullets were oni the endangered list as ATF wanted to remove its exemption from a federal law that protects police officers .

"The director of a Gregg Allman biopic, 'Midnight Rider', has pleaded guilty in the death of a camera assistant, who was killed by a train as his crew filmed on tracks without permission. Randall Miller will spend two years in the county jail, another eight years on probation and pay a $20,000 fine for the involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing charges stemming from the February 2014 crash. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors dropped charges against his wife and business partner, Jody Savin. The executive producer, Jay Sedrish, also pleaded guilty and got 10 years on probation. The parents of 27-year-old Sarah Jones, the camera assistant killed in the crash on a rural Georgia railroad bridge last year, spoke with reporters outside the court in Jesup on Monday. Scroll down for video . Locked up: Randall Miller, in court on Monday with his wife, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death of a camera assistant who was killed as his crew filmed on train tracks without permission . 'We hope the sacrifice of our daughter's life will continue to change the film industry,' Jones' father, Richard Jones, told reporters outside the courthouse. 'I believe it sends a message, frankly, that if you do not respect those you're in charge of, you may end up behind bars.' The crew had stepped onto the railroad bridge spanning the Altamaha River for the first day of filming 'Midnight Rider' on February 20, 2014. They were on the bridge even though CSX Transportation, the railroad company that owns the bridge, said it twice denied the filmmakers permission to film there. Assistant District Attorney John B. Johnson said Miller and the other filmmakers even attempted to rewrite the script to drop the scene they planned to shoot with actor William Hurt, in the role of Allman, in a hospital bed placed on the tracks. Miller decided to shoot the scene anyway, Johnson said, after the owner of the property surrounding the tracks said the movie crew could access its land. He said Miller and his crew went onto the railroad bridge after mistakenly thinking no more trains would pass that day. Killed: Sarah Jones, a 27-year-old camera assistant, was struck by a train as the crew filmed last year . Support: Richard and Elizabeth Jones, whose daughter was killed during the filming, speak with reporters outside the Wayne County Courthouse in Jesup, Georgia on Monday after Miller's guilty plea . A metal-framed bed was pulled across the tracks as a prop. When the freight train, which was traveling 55 mph, struck, it smashed the bed and hurled metal fragments at the fleeing crew. The train struck and killed Jones, a young camera assistant from Atlanta who had worked on TV series including 'Army Wives' and 'The Vampire Diaries.' 'Sarah Jones was hit by the edge of the fuel tank and was run over by the train,' Johnson told the judge. 'She died instantly.' A sobbing Miller called Jones' parents to tell them she was dead. Actor William Hurt had been on the set in his role as the Allman Brothers Band singer in his later years, but he was unhurt. Jones' death galvanized behind-the-scenes film workers nationwide to push for improved safety standards on sets. The case is a rare example of filmmakers being prosecuted for deaths. Struck: Footage taken from the CSX locomotive shows a bed on the tracks as it approaches the fleeing camera crew. The train hit the bed, which knocked Miss Jones and forced her into the train's path . Under state law, someone can be convicted of involuntary manslaughter for committing a misdemeanor — in this case trespassing — that unintentionally causes another person to be killed. The director, whose previous films included 'Bottle Shock' and 'CBGB,' testified last May in a related civil case that he had been told only two trains a day crossed the bridge and he only set out with his crew onto the trestle after a pair of trains had passed. Asked if the crew had obtained permission from the railroad to film on its tracks, Miller said that wasn't his job. But he bristled at the suggestion he recklessly put his crew in danger. 'I was in the middle of the track and I almost died,' Miller said in civil court May 12. Speaking to ABC 20/20 last year, hairstylist Joyce Gilliard, who suffered an arm injury in the crash, said those involved in the shoot had been told that if a train comes, 'you have 60 seconds to get off the track'. 'They wanted to get the shot, so whatever it took to get the shot is what they did,' she said. 'The entire crew was put in a situation where we all had to basically run for our lives.' Arrested: Miller and his business partner and wife, Jody Savin, right, turned themselves in to authorities after the crash. As part of his plea deal, the charges against Savin have now been dropped . Biopic: The crew were filming the scene for a movie about musician Gregg Allman, pictured in January . The 'Midnight Rider' movie has been in limbo since the crash. Allman sued Miller to prevent the director from reviving the film. They settled out of court last year, and terms were not disclosed. After his plea was accepted, Miller followed a sheriff's deputy from the courtroom to begin his two-year sentence at the Wayne County jail. Miller's attorney, Ed Garland, said he expects the director could be released from jail within a year. He said Miller accepted the plea deal to prevent prosecution of his wife, who left the courthouse in tears. Garland said the filmmaker never intended to put his crew at risk. 'Randall Miller at the time this happened believed there were not any more trains that would come down that track,' Garland said. 'But he accepts responsibility.' Sedrish's attorney, John Ossick, declined to comment as he left the courthouse. Miller previously directed the 2008 film 'Bottle Shock' as well as 'Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing & Charm School' in 2005, 'Noble Son' in 2007 and 'CGBG' in 2013. He and Savin have their own independent production company, Unclaimed Freight Productions, based in Pasadena, California.","Randall Miller struck a plea deal that will see him serve two years in a county jail and eight years probation and pay a $20,000 fine .

"The bodies of five dead babies have been found hidden in a house in France - four in the freezer and one in a portable cooler. Police made the macabre discovery after a 40-year-old father called them at 7am in the town of Louchats, in the south west, close to Bordeaux. In what is believed to be the worst case of infanticide in the country this century, the farmer first of all said he had found a tiny body in the thermally insulated container, one normally used to keep cold drinks. Police officers enter the home where the bodies of five babies were discovered in France . Officers searched the premises, and found four more babies in a large freezer regularly used by the family. The man's wife was immediately sedated and rushed to hospital, while the husband, who is a farmer, was arrested so he could be questioned at length. Neither has yet been identified. 'The first body was a newborn,' said a source close to the investigation which has been opened into the horrific case. It is believed that the woman had 'secretly given birth, within the last 48 hours', without telling anybody. The husband was said to be 'absolutely devastated and shaking uncontrollably' when the discoveries were made. The couple have two daughters, aged 13 and 15, who were thought to have been present when the first body was discovered. They are now in the care of the police, supported by social workers. There will be DNA tests to confirm the children's parentage. Locals who had seen the woman recently said there were no signs that she was pregnant. And a relative of the father said that he was not aware either and was in a state of complete shock at the discovery of the dead babies. The town's mayor Philip Carreyre, who went with police to the scene, said: 'I will not say anything about this. The only thing I can point out is that these are good people perfectly integrated in the town.' The father runs a small business maintaining gardens. Police were called to the address (pictured) after the 40-year-old father called them about 7am . Officers searched the premises, and found four more babies in a large freezer regularly used by the family . Pathologists need to establish whether the babies, all apparently self-delivered in secret, were stillborn or died soon after birth. The first baby found in a cool bag was 'viable' (capable of life) it was revealed tonight. Deputy Prosecutor in the High Court of Bordeaux, Anne Kayanakis, told a press conference: 'It is not yet possible to say whether this was a full term birth. Further analysis is needed to determine the cause of death.' Post mortems on the four other newborns discovered in a freezer will take place tomorrow. Depending on the results prosecutors will determine the nature of any criminal charges. 'Nothing has been established,' said Kayanakis. 'This is a particularly heavy and delicate investigation and a highly serious matter.' She said biological and genetic analysis was on going to determine the relationship of the babies in the case. But she said, the mother had immediately admitted to police giving birth to the child two days before he was found. She had now been placed in a psychiatric hospital. The tragedy, in Louchats, France, is believed to be the worst case of infanticide in the country this century . Meanwhile In Louchats, villagers were still in shock at the news that has unfolded. The couple and their two daughters were described as 'just a normal family.' Said one resident: 'Knowing them it is just unbelievable. They are discreet people who never posed any problems. Just people who get up every morning and go to work. 'We're all just stunned.' The bodies of five dead babies have been found hidden in a house in Louchats (shown in this file picture) in south west France . France has a sinister history of dead babies being found in freezers. In 2013 a 32-year-old waitress from Amberieu- en-Bugey, in the east of the country, admitted drowning her two newborns and placing their bodies in one. She had previous convictions for similar crimes and was sentenced to 15 years for infanticide. Her mother, who had helped her in the crimes, got an 18 year sentence. In November 2012 a three-month-old boy and a five-year-old girl were found dead in a freezer in Vienne, Isere. The mother was also found dead, while the father fled to Tunisia. And in March 2003 police in Tinteniac, Brittany, found the body of a new-born baby in a freezer and the remains of three other children buried in the garden of the house. The mother was later given a 15-year prison sentence. Such cases are often linked to 'pregnancy denial', where women refuse to accept that they are in fact pregnant.","Four bodies found in freezer and one in portable cooler in French home .

"Accused murderer Daniel Jack Kelsall's confession that he was having intrusive thoughts about killing a 'random' was a chilling prophecy and key to the case against him, the crown says. 'The truth is simple. It is awful, but it is simple. This man killed Morgan Huxley for no reason,' Peter McGrath SC said. Looking directly at the jury, the crown prosecutor on Tuesday detailed point by point the aspects of the case against the 22-year-old, that, he said, would leave them to infer only one thing. 'This young man Daniel Jack Kelsall in the early hours of September 8, 2013, indecently assaulted Morgan Huxley and then stabbed him to death in his bedroom,' he said. This comes as the jury retired on Tuesday afternoon to consider its verdict on Kelsall's trial. Scroll down for video . Morgan Huxley (pictured) was fatally stabbed on September 8, 2013 at his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore . 'The truth is simple. It is awful, but it is simple. This man killed Morgan Huxley (pictured) for no reason,' Peter McGrath SC said in court on Tuesday . 'This young man Daniel Jack Kelsall (pictured) in the early hours of September 8, 2013, indecently assaulted Morgan Huxley and then stabbed him to death in his bedroom,' the crown prosecutor said . Kelsall, Mr McGrath told the jury, would have them believe that within minutes of striking up a conversation with Mr Huxley - a complete stranger - the 31-year-old had invited him into his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore. '(Then) this man, a total stranger agreed to the accused's suggestion that he might like to engage in a sexual encounter with him to relieve his stresses.' Finally, while engaging in this intimate act someone bursts into the bedroom and hits him over the head and assaults Mr Huxley. Terrified, Kelsall runs away. 'Members of the jury, how plausible was that scenario so far?' Mr McGrath asked. Urging the jury not to be distracted by 'red herrings', Mr McGrath said the crown case against the former junior chef was straight forward and added up. It was not Kelsall, he said, that was in the wrong place at the wrong time but Mr Huxley. 'Chillingly he just happens to be someone who has expressed intrusive, recurring and persistent thoughts about killing someone with a knife on the way home from work. A total stranger. Some random.' This was the 'key' that explained what happened to Mr Huxley that night, Mr McGrath said. Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore . Jessica Hall (middle) - the ex-girlfriend of Morgan Huxley - gave evidence at Daniel Jack Kelsall's murder trial in Sydney last week . Earlier in the trial, Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore. Kelsall said that he struck up a conversation with Mr Huxley while walking home in the early hours of the morning. He said Mr Huxley was smiling during the friendly chat but became more serious as he started talking about how he had had a 'stressful week'. 'He said he had some problems with work,' Kelsall said. 'I said something like, 'Do you want to talk about it?'. 'He seemed a little hesitant about it and then he said, 'Yeah, I could do with someone to talk to'.' Mr Huxley then invited him to his apartment, Kelsall told the jury. Rebecca Prins, who was dating Morgan Huxley in the months before his death, is pictured leaving the NSW Supreme Court after giving evidence . After talking for a while about Mr Huxley's work, which 'wasn't going so well', Kelsall said he asked the 31-year-old 'Do you want to do things with me?' The pair then went upstairs to Mr Huxley's room. 'He (Mr Huxley) came in after me and turned off the lights and he immediately dropped his pants.' With his shoes still on, Kelsall said Mr Huxley lay down on his bed. Kelsall told the court he sat between Mr Huxley's legs and began fondling his penis. 'Then something hit me in the side of the head. It really hurt,' Kelsall said. Mark Kelsall gave evidence last week at the trial of his son Daniel who is accused of killing Morgan Huxley in 2013 in the victim's Sydney apartment . Paramedics Mark Lenehan and David Rigby, who were the first responders to the home of murder victim Morgan Huxley, were pictured arriving at the NSW Supreme Court last week . 'I kind of looked up and there was another person in the room. I got up and ran. 'I knew there was at least one (person there). It could have been more.' He told the court he didn't tell police because he was afraid of having anything to do with the murder. 'I want to make amends and tell the truth for a terrible lie I have told and I want them (the jury) to understand my side of the story,' Kelsall said. Jury deliberations will continue tomorrow.

"Dozens of Nigerian women who were forced to marry Boko Haram fighters were reportedly slaughtered by their 'husbands' before a battle with troops in the northeast town of Bama. Witnesses said the Islamist militants feared they would be killed by advancing soldiers or separated from their wives when they fled the town. They killed the women to prevent them from subsequently marrying soldiers or other so-called non-believers, they said. Sharifatu Bakura, 39, said: 'The terrorists said they will not allow their wives to be married to infidels.' Scroll down for video . The leader of the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram Abubakar Shekau. The insurgents have lost ground to army forces in recent weeks . Nigeria's military, along with forces from neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger have claimed huge victories over the insurgents in recent weeks but defenceless civilians still face serious threats. The Mother of three said Boko Haram fighters had got word of a military assault on Bama, formerly an Islamist stronghold in Borno state. The insurgents had decided to flee to the nearby town of Gwoza before the troops' arrival but first decided 'to kill their wives so that nobody will remarry them', she said. Mrs Bukara's husband was killed by the insurgents four months ago but she was spared from a forced marriage because she was visibly pregnant. Boko Haram forcibly married scores of women in Bama after seizing it in September but Nigeria's military announced its recapture of the town on Monday. Witnesses who were taken under military protection this week to Borno's capital Maiduguri, 45 miles away, said the killing of women began 10 days before Bama was liberated. The Islamists said 'if they kill their wives, they would remain pious until both of them meet again in heaven, where they would re-unite', said Salma Mahmud, another witness. A vigilante who fought alongside the military in the battle to retake Bama, Abba Kassim, said he saw 'dozens of women corpses' in the town. It has not been possible to verify exact numbers of those killed. Fanna Aisami, 52, also in Maiduguri after escaping Bama this week, said the executions followed a warning from Boko Haram's top commander in the town. 'He informed them of the situation and ‎the consequence of the takeover of the town by the advancing troops. 'He warned them that when soldiers killed them they would take their wives back to the society where they would be forced to marry and live with infidels,' said the mother of seven. The commander 'said it would be better for them to kill their wives and send them to heaven,' with number of women were shot dead in front of his house, she said. Advances: A photo released by the Nigerian Army shows soldiers in Goniri this week as forces claim a number of victories against the insurgents . Yagana Mairambe, 58, said some Boko Haram men refused and fled with their wives towards neighbouring Yobe state. Nigeria's national security spokesman Mike Omeri is working to verify the reports while the military could not immediately be reached for comment. With Boko Haram gunmen facing heavy military pressure across northeast Nigeria, attacks, including suicide bombings, have persisted, even as the government in Abuja tries to assure voters that March 28 elections will be secure. Security operatives search  for information at the main gate to the Monday Market where the blast occurred in Maiduguri, Nigeria, earlier this month . The Islamist uprising has claimed more than 13,000 lives since 2009 and President Goodluck Jonathan has faced fierce criticism over failure to contain the violence. The latest reported atrocities in Bama recall similar massacres at high schools and colleges across northeast Nigeria, where Boko Haram has executed scores of students learning a so-called infidel curriculum.","Fighters forcibly married women in Bama after seizing it in September .

"After supposedly inventing Mother's Day in his country four years ago, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un has taken his unlikely stance on gender equality a step further. During a visit to an airbase yesterday, the despot hailed International Women's Day by handing out free make-up and sending congratulations to the wives of airmen in honour of the occasion. While not meeting any of the men's partners in person, he was said to have asked commanding officers to pass on his gifts of food and cosmetics. Unlikely feminist: Kim Jong-Un, pictured on a official airbase visit yesterday, is mobbed by female workers after publicly recognising International Women's Day . His recognition of gender rights comes one week after female defectors in Seoul claimed women in North Korea do not receive sex education, are subjected to forced abortions and in the military are required to perform sexual favours on high-ranking men, the Independent reports. North Korean paper Rodong Sinmun recently put forward the country's feminist credentials while criticising the 'discrimination against women workers protested in South Korea', who KCNA said were unable 'to live as human beings'. Meanwhile, KCNA's main report on the anniversary of 'Kim Jong-il's work and International Women's Day' said the country had 'demonstrated its might as an example of the progressive women's movement of the world under the wise guidance of peerlessly great men'. 'The Korean women's movement greets the heyday of its development as it is led by Marshal Kim Jong Un,' it added before hailing Kim  as the inventor of 'Mother's Day, the first of its kind in Korean history' - four years ago. Airbase visit: The leader told airmen to congratulate their wives and also gave them gifts of make-up . Pearls of wisdom: The secretive despot appears to offer advice to kitchen workers at the airbase unit . As well as his nod to International Women's Day, the leader took the opportunity to heap praise on his late father Kim Jong-Il, noting his 'patriotism, faith, anti-imperialist class education and moral education', according to the Rodong Sinmun report. During the visit, the leader also demonstrated his green credentials after reportedly highlighting the need to develop wind, solar and geothermal energy to solve electricity problems. Much of North Korea's 24 million population experience power cuts every day. Inspecting facilities: During the tour, Kim inspected a new power station and  also took the opportunity to tour the site's training facilities as well its washroom, kitchen, greenhouse and mushroom cultivation room . Green stance: Kim reportedly also highlighted the need to develop wind, solar and geothermal energy to solve electricity problems during a speech . The leader and his entourage are said to have flown to the site in his private plane - a Soviet-era IIyushin Il-62. His visit to the secretive state's air force unit was to inspect a new power station, but the leader also took the opportunity to tour the site's training facilities as well its washroom, kitchen, greenhouse and mushroom cultivation room. Kim, who was educated in Geneva and is thought to be 32, posed for photos with pilots, telling them they should always be  ready for combat and reminding them of the slogan: 'We wait only for the Party's order for missions!' Praised father: The dictator, thought to be 32, also took the opportunity to mention former leader Kim Jong-Il's patriotism, faith, anti-imperialist class education and moral education' Defectors' revelations: His recognition of gender rights comes one week after female defectors in Seoul claimed women in North Korea do not receive sex education, are subjected to forced abortions and in the military are required to perform sexual favours on high-ranking men .","North Korean leader made reference to international event on air base visit .

Researchers are trying to find out the cause of their deaths, and one option being explored is poisoning. Unexplained:The cause of the deaths of more than 150 fish is being explored, but is not currently known . Lone fish: Just one lonely tuna remains in the vast doughnut-shaped tank at Tokyo Sea Life Park in Japan . A spokesman for the tourist attraction said: 'We have had the tuna tank since the aquarium opened in 1989 but never experienced this kind of mass-dying. 'We are studying what caused the fish deaths, but we haven't figured it out yet. We suspect that it could be due to new factors that were not present before.' The tank's lighting and other factors that could have caused stress among the fish, or the presence of a poisonous substance in the water are being considered. The 2,200-tonne tank once housed 69 bluefin tuna, 52 eastern little tuna and 38 oriental bonito. In December, the tank's population suddenly started plunging with just 30 fish alive by mid-January. Researchers are trying to find out the cause of their deaths, and one option being explored is poisoning . 'The second last one that just died apparently crashed into the acrylic wall twice,' the spokesman added. 'It suffered a broken backbone, which was unfortunate but not very unusual for tuna kept in a tank. 'An earlier examination has found some sort of virus among some of the dead fish, but it wasn't the kind that is usually fatal in fish farms.'","More than 150 fish died at an Japanese aquarium and only one survived .

"An incredible road map of the Universe showing the pathways between our Milky Way and 100,000 other far away galaxies has been revealed by scientists after a 10-year quest into the unknown. The gigantic supercluster of stars, planets and asteroids, which stretches 500 million light years across and has the mass of a hundred quadrillion suns, has been named Laniakea - Hawaiian for 'immeasurable heaven'.

An incredible road map of the Universe revealing the pathways between our Milky Way (red dot) and 100,000 other far away galaxies has been revealed . The gigantic super-cluster of stars, planets and asteroids, which stretches 500 million light years across and has the mass of a hundred quadrillion suns, has been named Laniakea . The astonishing discovery has revealed that the Milky Way (red dot) - home to Earth and our solar system - is on the fringes of the enormous cosmic web . The vast road map may look as though it is densely packed, however there are vast expanses of darkness where nothing can be found for hundreds of light years. Our supercluster is the first to be mapped and shows galaxies strung out along glowing pathways that are held together by gravity as the groups make their way through space. Scientists have long-known that galaxies are not distributed randomly but congregate together in clusters. When these clusters meet in the cosmos, they create giant superclusters, like Laniakea. To put the sheer size of the supercluster into context, the Earth is the third planet from our Sun, which is one of just billions of stars within the Milky Way. Other than being our home, our galaxy is nothing special and is one of around 100,000 within our supercluster. And even though the collection of bright galaxies is incomprehensibly large, it makes up just a corner of the observable Universe. Within Laniakea, galaxies flow inwards towards a region called the Great Attractor, the equivalent of a large gravitational valley. Our supercluster is the first to be mapped and shows galaxies strung out along glowing pathways that are held together by gravity . The vast road map may look as though it is densely packed, however there are vast expanses of darkness where nothing can be found for hundreds of light years .

Around our supercluster are four others - known as Shapley, Hercules, Coma and Perseus-Pisces - however it is difficult to show exactly where our neighbourhood of galaxies ends and the others begin. Dr Brent Tully, from the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, led the team of scientists that mapped Laniakea's boundaries from measurements of the velocities of local galaxies. The researchers compared the galactic movement with that of water in a landscape of hills and valleys, tracing the outer surface of a region where the net-motion of galaxies was inward. They wrote in the journal Nature: 'We define a supercluster to be the volume within such a surface, and so we are defining the extent of our home supercluster, which we call Laniakea.'","Scientists reveal the Milky Way's position in an enormous supercluster of galaxies after 10-year quest into unknown .

"In the middle of the southern Andes is the unexpected Magic Mountain: a man-made volcano with a stunning waterfall cascading down its side. It's also the home to the spectacular Montaña Mágica Lodge, a luxury hotel in the heart of Patagonia's 300,000-acre Huilo Huilo Biological Reserve. Looking as though it's been plucked straight out of a fairy tale, the hotel is completely made out of wood and stone, and would no doubt be at home as a background set for The Hobbit. Scroll down for video . In the middle of the Chilean Patagonian rainforest is the Montaña Mágica Lodge, a luxury hotel built inside of a man-made volcano . Located under the majestic Andes Mountain range, the unique hotel is right in the middle of one of the most valued - and endangered - regions in the world. Aside from simply relaxing inside the one of a kind hotel, venturing into the rainforest offers guests the opportunity to spot many unique animals, such as the Pudu Deer, which is the world's smallest at just 13 inches tall. Inside, the five-floor hotel boasts an all-natural decor in its 13 small rooms, as well as several hot tubs carved out of gigantic tree trunks, and an intimate bar and restaurant area. But to experience the 'erupting' hotel, guests will need to brave a swinging rope bridge to enter, as it is only accessible by foot. The inside bar and restaurant is just as beautiful as the exterior, with it's all-natural wood and stone decor . If you're lucky, you may even spot the adorable 13-inch Pudu deer - the world's smallest - which lives on the nature reserve . The luxury hotel is only accessible by foot and all guests must walk across a suspension bridge in order to reach reception . Among the activities on offer are mini golf, where the holes are made out of the natural terrain, horseback riding, rafting, plenty of hiking trails and a chance to try the longest zip wire in South America, which runs through the nature reserve at a height of 1,500 feet. Montaña Mágica is part of the larger Huilo Huilo complex, with also includes the interconnected Baobab Hotel, which can be reached via a suspension walkway, and several other nearby lodges. Prices at Montaña Mágica range from £150 to £260 per night, which is a steal considering that some neighbouring hotels can go for as high as £1200 a night.

A Virginia mother shot an intruder to protect her two-year-old daughter after he broke into her family home. Allie (pictured right with her two-year-old daughter, left), who has not given her full name, is the wife of a James City County officer and said the incident happened on Wednesday around 10.30pm, an hour after her husband left for work . After the man, 25, broke through a window in her daughter's playroom, on instinct she grabbed her gun and fired two shots, injuring him (above her family home where the break in occurred) The man, who has not been identified, is recovering in hospital with life-threatening injuries, and could face a burglary charge once out, according to WTKR. Allie, who was trained by her husband on what to do during this type of incident, said the man started banging on her door and messing with the door knob while screaming things as he tried to get in. She said: 'He was screaming like, 'Let me in baby, we are okay let me in, they are out to kill me,' I looked through the peephole and I didn't recognize who it was, so I latched the top lock, ran to the back, called 911 and got my gun.' While she went to a back room to retrieve her gun, she heard a crash as the man broke into the playroom, an area where her child was only 30 minutes before the incident. She had only recently put her child to bed. 'She could have been in here playing and he could have busted in and fell on her or anything,' she said. 'All I knew is I wanted to stop him from hurting me or hurting my daughter.'

The man was hit in his groin and a second bullet went through his hand and into his stomach. The mother said she kept the gun fixed on the intruder as she waited for responding officers to arrive, according to Fox and Friends. Both Allie and her daughter were safe following the incident, but Allie said she is happy knowing it was not her or her daughter that was left in the hospital. 'It was either him or me,' said Allie.

"Hundreds of hens who lay unique pastel-colored eggs have been stolen from a family's farm just weeks before Easter. Gerald Leuschen, who hand-raised the chickens on Buddy's Farm in Sonoma County, California, said he has been left emotionally and financially devastated by the loss - which he predicts will cost him around $22,000. 'I miss my birds,' he told the Press Democrat. 'They're so beautiful!' Leuschen, who runs the farm with his wife and their two young sons, said he first noticed about half of his 600 to 700 'Easter Egger' hens were missing after returning to work following a brief illness. Scroll down for video . 'Taken': The owners of Buddy's Farm in California (pictured) have had hundreds of chickens stolen. The targeted hens are known for laying colorful eggs which are particularly in demand around Easter . Special: The 'Easter Egger' chickens lay pink, blue, green and cream eggs (pictured) but owner Gerald Leuschen said his family is now collecting just half of the eggs they would expect to have right now . He told KTVU that the birds apparently vanished overnight from their coop, which he had always left closed but unlocked until the theft. It came just days after he noticed the coop was wide open and that some of the birds were outside, so he told his sons, aged 11 and 13, to make sure they secured the door behind them. 'For someone to come in and do that is a violation. It's a huge violation,' he told KTVU. 'I'm angry they're taking the food right out of my family's mouth, but I can't carry that anger.' He believes someone who knows the farm and knows chickens could be responsible, and that too many chickens have disappeared for an animal to be responsible, the Press Democrat reported. Heartbroken: Leuschen, pictured, runs the Sonoma County farm with his wife, sons and brother-in-law and said he is emotionally and financially devastated by the disappearance of the chickens . Loved: He said he misses his beautiful Easter Egger chickens, all of whom he hand-reared from birth . Leuschen, who started the business a few years ago, said he is down around $75 a day in earnings from eggs and about $100 invested in each chicken, for a total of more than $22,000. Easter Eggers are a mix of different breeds. Their eggs may be blue, green, pink, brown, olive or cream. Each hen will give lay just one egg color - they do not each lay a variety. Egg colors occur when pigments are deposited as an egg moves through the hen's oviduct. The exact color then hen will lay is determined by their genetics. For example, some breeds lay only white eggs (Leghorns) or brown eggs (Orpingtons), while others lay more colorful eggs. An Olive Egger lays green eggs because it is the result of cross breeding between brown- and blue-laying chickens. Likewise, because Easter Eggers are a hybrid breed, a coop will lay a mixture of colors. Quite often the color of the chicken's earlobe (the flappy piece of skin at the side of their heads) will indicate the colors of their eggs. If a chicken has white earlobes, it will likely lay white eggs, while if the earlobe is pink, the eggs will likely be non-white. Despite the different colors on the shell, the eggs inside are the same and there are no major differences in flavor. Instead, flavor is determined by the chicken's diet. Easter Eggers are kept for their eggs but are not large enough to be used for meat. The birds, which he and his family incubated inside their home before hand-rearing, are a mixture of heritage and standard breeds, which allows for their colorful eggs. The demand for the eggs, which are blue, pink, grey, green and olive, is particularly high ahead of Easter, now less that two weeks away, the family said. Leuschen explained they should be collecting around 30 dozen eggs a day, and would expect to be getting as many as 50 dozen a day in a month - but right now they're only collected 21 dozen. 'Alas, someone else will reap the benefit of our time, money and efforts,' he wrote on Facebook as he appealed for friends and customers to share his story. But he added that they are committed to rebuilding their business and is offering a $250 reward for information leading to their return. In the meantime, he is padlocking the birds' enclosure and asking friends and neighbors to be on the lookout for anyone with new colorful eggs in the area. 'Maybe you have seen someone selling laying hens on craigslist or Facebook,' he wrote in his Facebook plea. 'Maybe the guy down the street just put up a sign. 'Perhaps your local feed store has some really beautiful chickens that don't fit any variety specifically. They could be our birds.' He asked for anyone with information about the whereabouts of his stolen hens to contact the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office, which said it is unclear if it will investigate.

"A mother accused of decapitating her three-month-old daughter had been ordered by a court to stay away from her - but an aunt who had custody of the child had allowed her to move in with them. Deasia Watkins, 20, was charged with aggravated murder on Monday after her baby daughter, Janiyah, was found beheaded on a kitchen counter at the aunt's house in Hamilton County, Ohio. The mother, who was diagnosed with post-partum depression earlier this year, had allegedly placed the kitchen knife in the baby's hand after murdering her, authorities said. Her aunt was asleep at the time but a child at the home found the baby's body and raised the alarm. Arrested: Deasia Watkins, 20, allegedly beheaded her three-month-old daughter, Janiyah, on Monday. She had been ordered to keep away from the child after she was hospitalized for psychiatric problems . The horrific killing came after Watkins had been forbidden to have contact with the child after she was hospitalized for psychiatric problems, authorities said at a Tuesday press conference. But the aunt had apparently let Watkins move in with her and the baby about a week earlier, Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters said. Then on Monday, a five-year-old child who was at the house to catch a school bus found the baby's body and ran outside to tell a male relative. The man woke up the aunt and she called police. In the 911 call, the aunt can be heard crying hysterically and asking for help while repeating, 'Oh, my God!' 'My niece killed her baby,' she said. She told the dispatcher that she was asleep when her son, who had come to drop off the children, came in and woke her up, saying the baby was dead. The son then told the dispatcher that he had seen the baby's body on the kitchen counter but did not know what happened. Victim: Authorities found the mother had placed the knife in baby Janiyah's hand after killing her on Monday . Tragic: Janiyah also had multiple stab wound to her face and a broken arm, authorities have said . 'It's a very violent scene,' he said. Police arrived to find the baby had been decapitated and stabbed multiple times. She had also suffered a fractured arm. Authorities also found the 20-year-old mother in bed covered with blood and took her into custody. 'This is one of the most disturbing cases I have ever seen in my life,' Deters said. Officers allegedly that Watkins smelled of marijuana and refused to hand over the baby. When they took her daughter she 'passed out with her eyes open', according to Cincinnati.com. She was taken to hospital for evaluation. She has been charged with aggravated murder but Deters said it was unlikely prosecutors would seek the death penalty. 'It was pretty clear to the officers involved that she is suffering from some serious mental issues,' Deters said. Watkins gave birth to her daughter in December and suffered post-partum depression. A cousin told Cincinnati.com that he had spoken to the child's father, who claimed the new mom had been 'acting crazy... speaking of demons'. The murdered baby was found inside this College Hill, Ohio home around 6am on Monday and Watkins was taken to hospital for mental evaluation. She was charged with aggravated murder . On January 25, police reportedly went to her apartment to find the baby crying and the young mother screaming. Then on March 6, a juvenile court judge ordered Hamilton County Job and Family Services to take custody of the baby after the young mom was hospitalized for psychiatric problems. It came after the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office filed a complaint that the baby girl had been neglected, WCPO reported. Deters said at the press conference on Tuesday that family services had done their jobs. HCJFS declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. 'It looks like JFS did their job exactly how they should, but you don't have the resources to be in the house 24/7,' Deters said. WCPO reported that Watkin's only previous brush with the law was a fine for disorderly conduct.","Deasia Watkins was found covered in blood 'after stabbing and beheading her baby daughter Janiyah at her aunt's Ohio home on Monday'

"The roommate of Martese Johnson, the black University of Virginia student whose head was split open during an arrest, had shown officers a real ID. Speaking to ABC News, Joshua Kinlaw said 'it hit my heart' when he found out his friend had been involved in the bloody arrest outside the Trinity Irish Pub in Charlottesville early on Wednesday. 'There is nothing he could've said or done that could provoke an officer of the law to assault him in such a manner,' he said. He added that contrary to the officers' suspicions, Johnson did not have a fake ID and had presented his real identification when a bar employee asked to see it. Scroll down for videos . Defense: Joshua Kinlaw, pictured speaking to ABC News, said 'it hit my heart' when he found out his friend, Martese Johnson, had been involved in the bloody arrest early on Wednesday morning . 'So the ID that he actually showed to both the bouncer and to the ABC [Alcoholic Beverage Control] officers was his real ID,' he said. 'Now because the age on that ID shows him to be 20 years old, I think that's when dispute and discrepancies came in.' After being turned away from the bar and questioned by police, Johnson was forced to the ground and pinned down. His bloodied face, caused by a gash to his head, was captured on camera and shared across social media. The student was charged with public intoxication and or swearing and obstruction of justice for the St Patrick's Day night incident outside the Trinity Irish Pub. He was released Wednesday morning. Kinlaw said he believed the incident was race-related because so many other students on campus try to get into bars when they are underage but do not face the same sorts of assaults. On Thursday, Johnson's lawyer, Daniel Watkins, shared the same story. Hurt: Johnson can be seen on the pavement after the scuffle with officers in the early hours of Wednesday . He explained that Johnson, a junior at UVA, was standing near the Trinity Irish Pub after midnight when a bouncer approached him and asked for his ID. He asked Johnson about his zip code, and Johnson gave his mother's current zip code in Chicago, which is different from the old one listed on his current Illinois license, Watkins said. Officers then questioned Johnson about being in possession of false identification, even though the ID was his, Watkins said. 'At no point during the encounter ... did Martese present a fake ID,' Watkins said. They forced him to the ground, pinned him down and handcuffed as his head began bleeding, Watkins said. Johnson did not speak at the news conference, but Watkins read a statement on his behalf, saying: 'I trust that the scars on my face and head will heal but the trauma from what the ABC officers did will stay with me forever.' He said he planned to fight the charges. Johnson, seen here on Thursday, was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice. He said through his lawyer, right, that he was 'shocked that my face was slammed into the brick pavement' The student (center) reportedly said the ZIP code of the address where his mother (left center, with son Michael, left) currently lives rather than the one listed on the ID he gave to Alcoholic Beverage Control officers . 'I still believe in our community. I know this community will support me during this time,' he said in the statement. Protests erupted at the campus following the arrest. On Wednesday night, a thousand students gathered on the prestigious campus to demand justice for their classmate. Johnson, a full scholarship student who had 10 stitches across his forehead, joined the protests, although he did not refer directly to the incident on advice of his lawyer. 'Regardless of your personal opinions and the way you feel about subjects to please respect everyone up here, we're all part of one community,' he told the crowd. School President Theresa Sullivan made a brief appearance on the grassy field, but only spoke to several reporters and did not make any formal remarks to the crowd. She released a statement saying that she was 'deeply concerned' 'contacted the Governor's office to ask for an independent investigation of the incident.' On Wednesday night, hundreds of students gathered at the University of Virginia campus to demand justice for Johnson. There was also a separate march through the town . The hashtag #JusticeForMartese was posted thousands of times on Twitter and student protesters have used the phrase 'black lives matter' and said that the arrest of Johnson (second from left) was racially motivated . 'The safety and security of our students will always be my primary concern, and every member of our community should feel safe from the threat of bodily harm and other forms of violence,' the statement read. Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo is expected to attend an open dialogue with UVA students on Friday to discuss his force's relationship to them. The Virginia State Police Association said Thursday that it was launching an administrative review and criminal investigation into the incident. Police will conduct the criminal investigation along with the City of Charlottesville Commonwealth's Attorney. The officers involved in the incident have been put on desk duty. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's office had released a statement Wednesday that called for state police to examine 'the use of force' by liquor control officers. ABC agents in Charlottesville have been accused of heavy-handed actions in the past. The state of Virginia reached a $212,500 settlement last year with a UVA student who was arrested after her purchase of water was mistaken for beer. Johnson, pictured left, is an honor student at the university, which has seen a string of controversies this year . Scene: The incident  occurred as Johnson stood outside Trinity Irish Pub just blocks from the campus . Elizabeth Daly fled in terror outside a Charlottesville supermarket in April 2013 when her vehicle was swarmed by state ABC agents who mistook her just-purchased carton of sparkling water for an alcoholic beverage. According to Daly's lawsuit, badges worn around the casually dressed ABC agents' necks were not clearly visible and the defendants did not verbally identify themselves as officers. Daly was charged with eluding police and assaulting a police officer after her SUV grazed two of the agents. The arrest provoked a public outcry, and the charges were dropped. Johnson is scheduled to appear in court on March 26. See below for video . Tragedy: University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, 18, pictured, was found dead in October .

Jesse Matthew Jr.has been charged with first-degree murder. Rolling Stone fraternity rape allegations . The University of Virginia fraternity was hit with allegations of gang rape in a Rolling Stone article. A police investigation  turned up no evidence of the alleged sexual assault. Phi Kappa Psi was suspended in November, after Rolling Stone published a story featuring a UVA junior named 'Jackie' who claimed to have been brutally gang-raped by a group of men at the fraternity during her freshman year. All fraternities and sororities at the Charlottesville, Virginia campus were temporarily suspended in the wake of the controversial article, which provoked protests on campus over the school's relaxed prosecution of sexual assault reports.

"It is the largest cave in the world, with its own sheer rocky cliffs, jungle-like vegetation and climate. So it is no wonder photographer Ryan Deboodt, 31, relied on a drone to capture footage showing the immense size of the Hang Son Doong cave in Vietnam. The result is a spectacular video showcasing the dramatic topography inside the cave, which is 5.5 miles long, 650ft wide and 500ft tall. Opening with shots pan across the vast jungle-like vegetation and adventurers are traipsing through the cave are dwarfed by their immense surroundings. Ryan, originally from America but now living in Beijing, China, described the cave as like an extraterrestrial planet. He said: 'This was my third visit to Son Doong. It was actually last minute that I even decided to take the drone in with me. 'I was originally going in to the cave to collect three timelapse cameras I had in there for six months to document the flooding.' The process took Ryan eight days to complete and he was required to take a lot of ropes, harnesses and safety equipment into the cave with him. The drone captures the staggering height of the cave and people in the images appear to be specks on the landscape . A time lapse shot captures a beam of sun light moving through the top of the cave over the course of a day . Outside shots of the cave show the magnitude of it and capture the grand scale of its reported 500ft . Tourists with a spare £1,800 ($3,000) can take tours of the cave with a company called Oxalis. A team of more than 25 porters, safety experts and guides take the tour over six days. The journey to the cave takes a day and a half through dense uninhabited jungle, before you abseil 260ft down to its entrance. Tours must be booked in advance as there is a strict limit of 10 guests per departure. He said: 'Throughout the entire cave you have to be extra cautious, as something as simple as a twisted ankle can cause much grief and effort in order to get back out of the cave.' Ryan explained that while he was within the cave he wouldn't have been surprised to have seen a dinosaur. He said: 'Being inside Son Doong is absolutely unreal. I felt tiny, insignificant.' The cave was first discovered in 1991, when a local farmer stumbled across it and sought shelter there from a storm. Before the chance discovery, it had remained undetected beneath the Annamite Mountains in a remote part of central Vietnam for millions of years. Unable to find the cave again on a repeat visit, the farmer gave up the hunt until he was approached by a group of cavers to help him find it. The colossal underground network of tunnels was discovered in 2009 and officially named the world's largest cave. A natural staircase covered in greenery is captured up-close and  explorers can be seen climbing them . The cave was first discovered in 1991 by a local farmer and is five times the size of Malaysia's Deer Cave . A number of shots capture beams of sun light and the vast jungle-like vegetation that grows inside the cave . The name 'Son Doong' cave means 'mountain river cave'. It was created 2-5 million years ago by river water eroding away the limestone underneath the mountain Where the limestone was weak, the ceiling collapsed creating huge skylights. The mesmerising six-minute-long video presents the different parts of the underground world, from the harsh and jagged rocks to the lush greenery and the cave's own lake and river. A timelapse shot captures the sun filtering through one of the many sinkholes which allows natural light in to illuminated the hidden underground world. Ryan Deboodt's photography can be found on his website and Instagram page, and the original video can be viewed here.

The 28-year-old, explained: 'The Narbis' sleep training programme is designed to improve the performance of a brain pattern known as SMR (sensorimotor rhythm) which is related to relaxation. Devon Greco, the inventor of Narbis, claims that with repeated use, the glasses can train a person’s brain to focus for longer periods of time as well as help them relax and get a good night’s sleep. Here, a woman has lost focus on her book, indicated by the lenses on the glasses turning opaque . The glasses are designed to use neurofeedback technology, which relays the information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head (illustrated right), to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness. An app will record a user's progress in improving their concentration . Narbis is a headset that uses sensors to measure a user’s brain patterns and send these signals to a set of electrochromic lenses. When a wearer’s attention drifts, the lenses darken and when they focus, the specs clear. Users will be able to train their brains by practicing keeping the lenses clear. The idea is that with work, they will be able to stay focused for longer and even learn how to shift into a state of focus at will. By doing two 30-minutes training sessions a week, they will start to see improvements in their brain's overall performance, Mr Greco’s Kickstarter page claims. ‘Through repeated training sessions, you can learn how to encourage good habits and discourage bad ones,’ it says. ‘The calming program is designed to help manage stress by regulating the level of alpha and theta waves which have been linked to anxiety, panic disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder.’ The glasses are designed to use neurofeedback technology, which relays the information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head, to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness. Mr Greco, from Paoli in Pennsylvania, said: ‘Neurofeedback has proven to be a useful tool in helping people improve their concentration, sleep, memory, anxiety and self-esteem.' ‘Narbis brings neurofeedback out of the clinical setting and into your living room, office, air plane seat, park bench or anywhere you are.’ Mr Greco’s Kickstarter page says: ‘By doing just two short training sessions a week, you can improve your brain's performance’ and that just 10 sessions are needed before users start noticing a difference in their ability to concentrate.' Narbis will come with five training sessions: one to boost a person's ability to concentrate and learn and retain information, one to boost creativity and hand-eye coordination and another to help wearers fall asleep more easily. Narbis will come with five training sessions, including one to boost a person's ability to concentrate and learn and retain information, one to encourage creativity and hand-eye coordination and another to help wearers fall asleep more easily. One of the exercises is shown . Users will have to wear a connected armband - which holds a battery and extra electronics to provide a Bluetooth connection –as well as the glasses, which have three sensors attatched . The Narbis system uses neurofeedback, which is described as exercise for the brain. The neurofeedback technology in the glasses relays information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head, to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness. Studies have shown that neurofeedback training increases neuroplasticity, or the brain’s ability to form connections between brain cells, according to Mr Greco. The training has been proven to significantly improve people's day to day lives by helping with concentration, sleep, anxiety, memory, self-esteem, fine motor skills, and overall mood. ‘Significant results have been achieved in slowing the cognitive effects of ageing and improving learning challenges with lasting effects,’ the Kickstarter page says. There will also be a programme to boost self-confidence and self-awareness, as well as managing stress more effectively. Users will have to wear a connected armband - which holds a battery and extra electronics to provide a Bluetooth connection – and will be able to monitor their progress in exercises using an accompanying app and set goals for themselves. The neurofeedback system was originally developed by Mr Greco’s parents, Domenic and Lindsay Greco, in partnership with Nasa. In 2009, Domenic was diagnosed with the degenerative disease ALS but continued to work on the Neurofeedback system with his son until he died in 2013. ‘It was the best opportunity of my life to work with my father on developing neurofeedback systems,’ Devon Greco said. ‘I couldn't have asked for a better partner and mentor. My father was a leader in his field and a true visionary.’ He is raising money to put his glasses into production on crowd sourcing website Kickstarter, where they can be pre-ordered from $295 (£199). ‘Narbis development is completed and we are ready to begin production,’ he said.

"Royal Mail has been accused by MPs of using its universal service commitment as an excuse to raise stamp prices. First and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on March 30, sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging parcel revenues. An influential committee of MPs said that if Royal Mail wanted to increase profits, it must invest in new technology and focus on efficiency, rather than simply increase prices. First and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on March 30, sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging parcel revenues. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee, said he was ‘not very pleased’ to hear they had taken the ‘easy option’ of raising stamp prices. Citizens Advice Bureau also urged Royal Mail to ‘focus on making efficiency savings rather than relying upon raising prices’ and expressed concern that consumers were held to ransom because they ‘have no choice but to pay the increased prices’. The cost of posting a large letter weighing up to 100g first class will rise by 2p to 95p. Royal Mail has warned it faces aggressive competition in the parcels market from delivery firm Whistl and called for regulators to rein in its rivals. The company says it is at a disadvantage to competitors because it must fulfil a 175-year-old ‘universal service’ obligation to deliver to all UK addresses for the same price. It said this obligation, which requires it to deliver six days a week to even the most rural communities, could soon become ‘financially unsustainable’ if Ofcom does not impose restrictions on its rivals. But the Business Committee will say today that there is no ‘immediate risk’ to the service and that, far from being a ‘burden’, the service brings ‘revenue and status’ to Royal Mail. A new report says: ‘Royal Mail should not increase postal and packaging prices simply in an attempt either to increase its own profit levels or to protect the Universal Service Obligation, without increasing the efficiency of its operations. ‘While we accept that Royal Mail has done much to improve efficiency, it still has to match the technical innovations introduced by many competitors — innovations that more clearly match the expectations of consumers.’ Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee, said he was ‘not very pleased’ to hear they had taken the ‘easy option’ of raising stamp prices . John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the rise in stamp prices would be unwelcome for many companies. He said: ‘While prices have only gone up by a penny, this still represents an above inflation rise. ‘Businesses affected will still have to decide whether to absorb this rise or pass it on to their customers.’ They said they expected Royal mail to use the additional money raised ‘to invest in improving their performance and meet delivery targets’. Mr Allan added: ‘Ofcom should carefully monitor how Royal Mail is doing, and use their powers to fine should customers’ expectations fail to be met.’ Since 1840, everyone in Britain, from the Cornish coast to the Scottish Highlands, has paid the same price to post a letter. Royal Mail says this expensive obligation is becoming increasingly difficult to fulfil because firms such as Whistl ‘cherry pick’ deliveries in more lucrative city locations and can therefore under-cut them on price. But when asked for evidence that it cost more to deliver in certain geographical areas, the company was apparently unable to provide this. Bailey felt the Royal Mail should be trying to make efficiencies instead of raising prices . The report said: ‘We were concerned to note that Royal Mail were unable to provide a regional breakdown of the cost of the Universal Service Obligation. ‘We also surprised to learn that there is no consensus between Royal Mail and Ofcom over what constitutes to cost, revenues and profits of the universal service.’ The report did concede that there could be a future risk to the universal service, however, ‘given the rapidly changing postal sector market’. It said Ofcom, the postal regulator, may need additional regulatory powers to ensure the future of the service. Mr Bailey said: ‘The universal postal service is available to everyone living in every part of the United Kingdom. It is an essential service to many people, especially those living in rural areas, to those less able to travel, to older people, and also to blind and partially-sighted people. ‘While our evidence indicated the universal service is not under immediate threat, we believe Ofcom needs to outline in more detail how it would respond quickly to changes in postal market conditions which may endanger the universal service.’ The Committee also called on Ofcom to help combat any ‘race to the bottom’ with regards to postal workers’ wages. It recommended Ofcom investigates the impact of providing the universal service on workers’ wages and conditions. An Ofcom spokesman said it had the powers to 'step in quickly to protect the needs of UK postal users' if a situation ever arose. Meanwhile, a Royal Mail spokesman said they welcomed the report, and shared in some of the committee's concerns and contribution - including the fact 'Ofcom may not be able to respond fast enough to avoid a failure in the Universal Service, even in the short term'. The spokesman added: 'We recognise and accept the Committee’s finding that Royal Mail has done much to improve efficiency, but there is still more for us to do to match the most efficient postal operators. We are continuing to invest in our business transformation programme and are becoming even more efficient.’ Last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable said Royal Mail should stop ‘whinging’ about its obligation to deliver to all parts of the country and accused it of ‘scaremongering’ by claiming its future was in jeopardy.","First and second-class stamps to rise by penny to 63p and 54p each .

"Theresa May has launched an official inquiry into undercover policing following revelations officers had sex with women they were spying on and even adopted the identities of dead babies. The Home Secretary appointed senior judge Lord Justice Pitchford to head the inquiry, which will focus on Scotland Yard's controversial Special Demonstration Squad. It comes amid revelations that more than 100 women may have been deceived into having sexual relationships with undercover police officers. Theresa May has launched an official inquiry into undercover policing following revelations officers had sex with women they were spying on and even adopted the identities of dead babies . A group of women are now taking legal action against the police over the emotional trauma they suffered. One women even had a child with a former Special Branch detective who was tasked with infiltrating the Animal Liberation Front in the 1980s. The unnamed woman only discovered her son's father was the undercover policeman Bob Lambert in 2012 after he was outed by other campaigners. The woman, known as Jacqui, received £425,000 in compensation from the Metropolitan Police last year. Mrs May today published an independent review into whether the Home Office knew what was going with undercover police officers. It found there was no evidence the department was aware of undercover officers' use of fake identities taken from dead children or the risk of officers forming relationships under false pretences with individuals they were spying on. The Special Demonstration Squad unit carried out undercover operations into 18 justice campaigns  - including the families of Jean Charles de Menezes (left), who was shot by police after being mistaken for a terrorist, and the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence (right) In the official inquiry into undercover operations Appeal Court judge Lord Justice Pitchford will have the power to compel witnesses to give evidence, said the Home Office. Mrs May announced her intention to set up a judge-led public inquiry following the report of the independent Ellison Inquiry in March 2014, which found that Scotland Yard had spied on the family of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence. And the separate police-led Operation Herne found that the now-defunct Special Demonstration Squad unit had carried out undercover operations to collect information on 18 justice campaigns over the course of 35 years - including that of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was shot by police after being mistaken for a terrorist. Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe was forced to pay out more than £400,000 to a women who had a child with an undercover officer posing as a campaigner . Set up in 1968 to infiltrate pressure groups and operational until 2008, the Special Demonstration Squad has been the focus of intense controversy in recent years over claims that undercover officers had sexual relationships and even fathered children with campaigners to help build trust in their false identities. Announcing the Pitchford Inquiry, Mrs May said: 'The work of Mark Ellison and Operation Herne has unearthed serious historical failings in undercover policing practices. As I said last year, I was profoundly shocked by Mark Ellison's findings and committed to establishing a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the SDS. 'I'm delighted to announce today that Lord Justice Pitchford has been appointed to lead the inquiry. 'While I initially said that Mark Ellison's further work and criminal investigations needed to conclude before the inquiry commences, it has become apparent that these pieces of work were much larger than initially envisaged. In the interest of learning the lessons of past failures, I have decided to establish the inquiry now while ensuring existing work is not affected. 'Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future.' She added: 'Operation Herne has previously found that the Home Office was instrumental in the establishment of the Special Demonstration Squad in 1968 and that the department initially provided direct funding for the SDS. 'The Permanent Secretary commissioned Stephen Taylor, former director at the Audit Commission, to establish the full extent of the Home Office's knowledge of the SDS. I'm grateful for Mr Taylor's report and will consider his findings carefully.'","Home Secretary appoints judge Lord Justice Pitchford to head the inquiry .

"The family of an industry heir brutally murdered in the Congo in 1960 have revealed new details of his death. Mark Higgins, 20, from Worcester, Massachusetts, was on his way to a kibbutz in Israel after working for missionary Albert Schweitzer in a jungle village in Gabon when he was shot by soldiers and hacked by machetes. The troops mistakenly believed he was a Belgian spy when they raided a house he was staying in. More than 50 years after his grisly death, his cousin Clarinda has travelled to Africa to unearth more information about his slaying. Brutal: Mark Higgins, 20, from Worcester, Massachusetts, was on his way to a kibbutz in Israel  in 1960 after working for missionary Albert Schweitzer in a jungle village in Gabon when he was hacked to death by Congolese soldiers. His cousin Clarinda (right) returned to Gabon to retrace his footsteps . Investigation: The troops responsible for his murder mistakenly believed he was a Belgian spy when they raided a house he was staying in the town of Kasongo . She has now released a book titled Against the Current: How Albert Schweitzer Inspired a Young Man's Journey which reveals the evidence she has discovered. Mr Higgins was the son of  Worcester industrialist Carter Higgins and grandson of Higgins Armory Museum founder John Woodman Higgins. He was destined to study at Yale University and move on to a senior position at his father's company, Worcester Pressed Steel. But he shunned the choices and instead traveled to Africa in 1959 at the age of 18. There he started work alongside the German-French philosopher at the Schweitzer Hospital in Lambaréné, Gabon. The complex set in a humid jungle included a leper village. After 13 months with Dr. Schweitzer, Mark Higgins was off on a another journey in June 1960, with the idea of backpacking up through Africa to a kibbutz in Israel. Meeting locals: She revisited the hospital where he used to work in a bid to unearth more information about his grisly death . Concern: Mr Higgins boarded a steamboat travelling north in 1960, but wrote a letter home on board saying: 'Something is incredibly wrong' when he realized it was going in the wrong direction . On June 30, 1960, the République du Congo achieved independence from Belgium. The country had formerly been called Belgian Congo. The situation led to a huge amount of violence and tension around the country. The gendarmerie and military force who mutinied against their former rulers began turnijng on Belgian citizens. Mr Higgins boarded a steamboat travelling north in 1960, but wrote a letter home on board saying: 'Something is incredibly wrong.' All the other vessels were going down the Kasai River, but his was heading inland instead. On July 25, 1960, Higgins was staying with a family in the town of Kasongo when armed mutineers looking for Belgians broke in. 'Mark raised his hands (and said), 'I'm American not Belgian,' ' Clarinda Higgins told the Worcester Telegram and Gazette. 'They shot him and macheted him.' Memories: During her visit she met a 90-year-old man called Joseph (left) who still remembered Mark after more than half a century . Her husband Bill stands at the spot where Mark came ashore to begin work in 1959 . Lambros Passialis, a Greek-African businessman living in the Democratic Republic of Congo who had been in touch with Mr Higgins, got in touch with the American consulate. In 2014 Clarinda Higgins returned to Gabon with her husband and two grown children to retrace Mark's footsteps. While there she met 90-year-old, Joseph, who had been there since at least the 1960s. Clarinda Higgins showed him a photograph of her cousin. After a pause, he said 'Oh, that's Mark.' 'It was a mind-blowing experience to be at Schweitzer's,' Clarinda told the paper. 'It's still fully operating. Still a real jungle clinic. The dining room is still the same dining room.' She also explained part of the reason why she ventured to Africa. Retracing steps: She walks around the Schweitzer Hospital in Lambaréné, Gabon, where Mark used to work . 'I adored him,' Mrs Higgins said. 'There was always this admiration. I remember three letters he wrote me. One was about working in the leper colony,' she added . In another letter, he told her ' 'I've learned something new, and it's the blessing to give help.' She said: 'He had found meaning in life. I get goose bumps when I read that letter. He had found meaning somehow. It was about helping and service.' Clarinda Higgins holds a bachelor's degree in Eastern Studies from Smith College and a master's degree in education. She taught elementary school for 11 years and has worked as an environmental educator since 1986. She was recognized with the Gold Award by the National Science Teachers Association. Her husband and co-author William G. Armstrong Jr is a former Associated Press writer and public relations executive in New York. Purchase a copy of Against the Current here .

"After centuries of science and exploration, you might think we know just about all there is to know about the planet we inhabit. But in the last year alone, scientists have discovered 1,451 new species in our oceans, according to an international audit of the seas published today. The marine creatures include weird and wonderful beasts from the deepest, darkest oceans, microscopic shrimp from coastal caves and even two new types of dolphin. Marine explorers off the coast of Australia discovered the venomous 'Keesingia gigas' jellyfish last summer – long as a man’s arm and powerful enough to kill a human. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered 1,451 new species in our oceans in the past year alone, according to an international audit of the seas, including the frilled shark (pictured) which was found off the coast of Namibia . The Indonesian Psychedelic Frog Fish (pictured) was found off Ambon Island in Indonesia by marine experts . The 'star-gazer' shrimp was found in the seas off South Africa, with striped eyes fixed on top of its tiny red body, seemingly staring at the heavens. And in 2014 biologists identified two new species of dolphin – one found near Papua New Guinea and the other in a Brazilian river – both of which are already threatened by fishermen. Despite the expansion of our knowledge however, scientists estimate we still only know about a tenth of the marine life on Earth. The World Register of Marine Species – which aims to become an inventory of all known ocean life – numbers 228,000 species, with new names being added every day. But scientists estimate there could eventually be two million on the list as our knowledge of the oceans grows. Over the last eight years since the project started, scientists have pored over records, examined historic journals, and poked and prodded the bodies of mysterious creatures of the deep. After countless hours of research, they have found we know only a fraction of the fish, whales and sharks swimming around our shores, or the squid and shrimp found in the darkest reaches of our oceans. The acceleration in research means four species are being added to the record a day. The World Register of Marine Species - which aims to become an inventory of all known ocean life - numbers 228,000 species, with new names being added daily. Pictured: A Polychaete Carpet Worm found off Japan . Skeleton Shrimp (pictured) were among the new discoveries after being found off the coast of California . Over the last eight years 122 sharks and rays have been added to the register, along with 131 members of the goby fish family and hundreds of different sponges. But experts say we still know little about the waters that make up 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface. At the current rate, it would take 360 more years to identify every creature thought to exist in the oceans, the researchers say. Dr Jan Mees, of the Flanders Marine Institute in Belgium and co-chairman of the marine register programme, said: ‘It is humbling to realise that humankind has encountered and described only a fraction of our oceanic kin, perhaps as little as 11 per cent. ‘The main gap at the moment is because of the under-exploration of the oceans. 'There are many, many places we have never been.’ But he added: ‘Sadly, we fear, many species will almost certainly disappear due to changing maritime conditions – especially warming, pollution and acidification – before we’ve had a chance to meet.’ 'The knowledge is vital for conservation efforts. 'Without knowing what species are there, we have no way of knowing what is at risk.' Some discoveries have significant benefits. Certain varieties of sea sponges, for example, have yielded valuable cancer-fighting agents. Experts estimate marine life has the potential to create more than 200 potential cancer drugs.","Scientists have discovered 1,451 new species in our oceans in past year .

"More beheaded animals have been found near the Northern California city of Sacramento, the latest in a string of mutilations since the beginning of the year. A birdwatcher working the fields of Yolo County on Sunday found a collection of five beheaded chickens and a beheaded turtle. Gina Knepp, who runs Sacramento's Front Street Animal Shelter, says it's the second find that included a turtle. Beheadings continue: A birdwatcher in Sacramento found five beheaded chickens and a turtle in a shopping bag dumped in a field. The find comes just wees after an animal control officer discovered chicken carcasses in a bag (pictured) She suspects the remains might be related to Santeria or other religious rituals that include animal sacrifices. ‘The turtle is a sign of Santeria, based on the little I know,’ Knepp told The Sacramento Bee. More common in Florida than California, Santeria is an Afro-Cuban religion that includes animal sacrifice. Chickens, goats and other animals are used in its rituals. The newspaper reports there have been at least 13 separate discoveries of decapitated goats, sheep and chickens and other animals since January. A county animal control officer went to the area of Babel Slough and South River roads shortly after the birdwatcher at 2pm called in a report of animal carcasses, a sheriff’s sergeant said. The Sunday discovery was the first reported since a Sacramento Bee reporter March 4 found a bag of decapitated chickens along the railroad tracks at 20th and W streets in Sacramento. The birdwatcher who made the disturbing discovery Sunday said the animal carcasses looked 'very fresh' and the blood appeared 'very red.' Earlier this month, two decapitated chickens were found in a box along a bike trail near the Sacramento River . The remains of the decapitated chickens and turtle were stuffed inside a brown supermarket shopping bag, which also featured simplistic yet ominous drawings. 'It looked to me like stick drawings of a head and a neck with a line drawn through it,' she said. Earlier this month, authorities reported finding two bags containing dead animals beside railroad tracks in Midtown Sacramento. One bag contained a beheaded rabbit with several tea candles. A second bag held at least two decapitated chickens with their feet cut off . Two weeks ago, two decapitated chickens were found in a box along a bike trail near the Sacramento River. Inside the box were also five blood-soaked $1 bills . The mystery began last fall, when a 120lb cow's head was found in Reichmuth Park and another one was found a few miles away at Garcia Bend Park.","Birdwatcher on Sunday found a collection of five beheaded chickens and a beheaded turtle in a brown bag .

"Facebook is 'illegally' tracking people’s internet searches across the web, even if they do not have an account with the social network. The technology company is using so-called internet ‘cookies’ – little pieces of tracking data - to collect information about people’s activity online, each time they visit a website which features a Facebook button. Academics in Belgium claim that Mark Zuckerberg's social network is breaching EU privacy laws by placing the tracking cookies on computers without the user's consent to log their browsing data. Privacy: Academics in Belgium claim that Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg (pictured last week) and with 1.3bn users, is placing tracking cookies on computers without the user's consent . Facebook buttons are on more than 13 million ordinary websites, including those run by the government and the National Health Service, and allow users to do things such as ‘like’ a website, or ‘share’ the link on their own Facebook page. A new report from the University of Leuven and a Brussels university claims that Facebook is tracking internet users in Europe for two years even if they have expressly opted out. Facebook has more than 1.3 billion users but there are millions more visits from people who are not signed up. The researchers say Facebook is putting tracking cookies on internet users' laptops, PCs and phones when the visit facebook.com - so they can target them with online advertising. This includes anyone clicking on a fan page or other pages still available without a login, or even when they visit some of the 13million pages with a Facebook module on it and do not click on it. The company first plants a tracking cookie on a user’s computer whenever they visit a website hosted on facebook.com, such as a page for a friend’s birthday party, a fan page for a celebrity, or for a brand or shop. After that, any web page they visit which features a Facebook button will relay information back to the social network. And the problem only becomes worse if they try to protect their privacy online, by ‘opting out’ of allowing web companies to track them. Under EU privacy law websites must gain consent before using a cookie, with few exceptions, and websites must ask users to accept cookies when they visit for the first time. Privacy campaigners have today accused Facebook of taking ‘staggering’ liberties by behaving in this way, and suggested that people can only really protecting themselves if they stop using the internet. Many online companies use cookies, sent over the internet and ‘planted’ on people’s computers, to gather as much information as they can about their users. These little pieces of data send information back to the companies’ servers, allowing them to ‘remember’ the user. Often this can help them do simple things like ‘remembering’ the user, so that they don’t have to log in afresh every time they visit a particular website. But cookies are also used to gather information about what websites people have visited, at which times of day, so that companies can target them with carefully tailored adverts. This practice, known as ‘behavioural advertising ‘, means that users who research a particular car online, for example, would then see an advert for the same car when they visit an unrelated website. Users can theoretically stop companies from tracking their information in this way by clicking an ‘ad choices’ button, featured on many websites. Once they click that button, people are invited to pick and choose which internet companies are allowed to track them, or just ban them altogether. However, researchers said today that Facebook takes the request to ‘opt out’ of online tracking as a cue to plant an extra cookie on people’s computers instead. Claims: People who visit Facebook without signing in or one of 13million external pages with a 'like' module are allegedly automatically tracked - even if they expressly opt-out . The special cookie, called ‘datr’, gives that person’s computer or smartphone a unique tracking number, and allows Facebook to follow its activity for the next two years. Report author Brendan Van Alsenoy told the Guardian: 'European legislation is really quite clear on this point. To be legally valid, an individual's consent towards online behavioural advertising must be opt-in. 'Facebook cannot rely on users' inaction - not opting out -  to infer consent. As far as non-users are concerned, Facebook really has no legal basis whatsoever to justify its current tracking practices.' The report's authors said that those who make the effort to opt out of getting Facebook cookies are given one as a result. Co-author Günes Acar said: 'If people who are not being tracked by Facebook use the 'opt out' mechanism proposed for the EU, Facebook places a long-term, uniquely identifying cookie, which can be used to track them for the next two years.' ‘If you take measures to protect your privacy from Facebook, you are actually going to be followed more on the internet,’ said Rob Heyman, another of the authors of the report. Privacy campaigners said today that Facebook seemed to have forgotten that people are private citizens, rather than money-making machines. ‘It is both staggering and disappointing that Facebook feels the need to track non-Facebook users, people who don’t want to interact with the social platform,’ said Renate Samson, chief executive of the lobby group Big Brother Watch. ‘Just because internet companies can do something doesn’t mean that they should do it. This takes it a big step further than what [European Commission Attorney Bernhard] Shima was saying, which is that if you don’t want to be spied on, you should opt out of Facebook. Actually, you need to opt out of the internet.’ Mr Shima said last week that people should close their Facebook accounts if they want to ensure that US security services are not spying on their information. Facebook today said that the report was inaccurate and the researchers had persistently ignored their request to meet. A Facebook spokesman said: 'This report contains factual inaccuracies. The authors have never contacted us, nor sought to clarify any assumptions upon which their report is based. Neither did they invite our comment on the report before making it public. 'However, we remain willing to engage with them and hope they will be prepared to update their work in due course.' 'Earlier this year we updated our terms and policies to make them more clear and concise, to reflect new product features and to highlight how we're expanding people's control over advertising. We're confident the updates comply with applicable laws including EU law.' Facebook was last month accused of acting in violation of EU privacy laws by the same academics who claimed they had just expanded its old policy, not changed it, which Facebook denied. The group claimed the social media site 'placed too much burden' on users, rather than protecting themselves. The site uses cookies – small files which it places on your web browser or device – to collect information which can then be transmitted back to Facebook. The move has been condemned by privacy campaigners . ‘If a Facebook user opts out, Facebook promises to stop collecting or using browsing information for the purpose of showing ads. Running a number of tests, we confirmed that Facebook still tracks its users when they visit a webpage containing Facebook social plugins, even after the user “opts out”,’ the researchers concluded. ‘Facebook tracks its users across websites even if they do not make use of social plug-ins, and even if they are not logged in.’ In January an Austrian court said it will consider a class action against Facebook by 25,000 people who are claiming their privacy has been breached. The David v Goliath case is being spearheaded by law student Max Schrems, who wants Mark Zuckerberg's social media site to compensate him and his supporters with a symbolic £400 each. A hearing in Vienna on April 9 will consider whether the lawsuit is admissible. Mr Schrems began his legal challenge last June, claiming that Facebook supplied personal information to the US Prism spy programme. Over the next few months 25,000 people added their names to the lawsuit. The programme is the U.S. secret service's worldwide monitoring and data mining system and was exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden last year. Mr Schrems is claiming damages of £397 (€500) per supporter, meaning that if the case was expanded and the activists won, Facebook would have to pay out a total of £23.8million.","Academics say that social network is breaching EU privacy laws .

"Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California system and former U.S. Homeland Security secretary, publicly apologized Thursday for calling chants by students protesting tuition hikes 'crap,' a remark overheard on an open microphone at a board of regents meeting. Napolitano, also a former Arizona governor, opened a regents meeting by expressing contrition, a day after the university's recording of a Wednesday gathering captured her saying, 'We don't have to listen to this crap,' when she leaned over to the board chairman who had just activated his microphone. The comment came after several dozen students in the University of California system stripped off their shirts at Wednesday's meeting, tossed fake money in the air and stood on chairs chanting 'egregious, step off it, put people over profits'. University of California president Janet Napolitano talks with Gov. Jerry Brown during a UC Board of Regents meeting in San Francisco . University of California Berkeley student Kristian Kim throws fake money while starting a protest during a UC Board of Regents meeting in San Francisc . Students were protesting tuition increases of up to five per cent in each of the next five years, what they say is a lack of support for black students at UC Berkeley and concern that a possible new campus in Richmond would displace low-income residents. The proposed increase would see next year's base cost for students rise from $12,192 up to $12,804 and  to $15,564 by 2019. Napolitano apologized Thursday 'for using a word that she doesn't normally use, which was picked up on the mike', Dianne Klein, spokeswoman for the University of California Office of the President, said in an email. She added: '[Napolitano] suggested that many of us have been in similar situations where an inadvertent comment was overheard'. Klein said the time allotted for public comments had ended Wednesday when protesters interrupted. 'This went on for quite some time and when the participants ignored police instructions to end their protest, the board chair began following the established procedure to temporarily shut down the meeting,' Klein said. Napolitano's comment reflected her personal frustration with disruptions that hinder discussions on topics 'vital to the future of the university and the education of its students,' Klein said.

"The Nigerian presidential elections has been won by the opposition party for the first time in the country's history. General Muhammadu Buhari beat incumbent president Goodluck Jonathan by 2.1million votes in a historic win which has seen thousands take to the streets in celebration. Jonathan  conceded this afternoon and called 72-year-old General Buhari to congratulate him, Aviation Minister Osita Chidoka said. Scroll down for video . Bad luck, Jonathan: General Muhammadu Buhari, 72, (right) beat incumbent president Goodluck Jonathan(left) by 2.1million in a historical opposition win . Jonathan's concession came before the final announcement of election results by the Independent National Electoral Commission and as Buhari prepared to address the nation. After the votes from the country's 36 states and small Federal Capital Territory were in this evening, Buhari was found to have won with 15.4 million votes against Jonathan's 13.3 million. The win marks the first time in Nigeria's history that an opposition party has democratically taken control of the country from the ruling party. General Buhari, who has previously made three failed attempts to win the presidency, ruled Nigeria from  1984 until mid-1985, after a seizing power in a military coup. His brief dictatorship saw him rule the nation with an iron fist, jailing people for trivial missteps such as public littering, and punishing civil servants who arrived late to work with gruelling physical exercises. Buhari was eventually was overthrown by his own soldiers after attempting to cover up Nigeria's deepening economic crisis, by silencing the press and jailing journalists. Supporters: Residents celebrate the anticipated victory of Buhari  in Kaduna, northern Nigeria . Big win: General Buhari has enjoyed most support in the mainly Muslim north, but also won several key-states in the Christian southern states . Incumbent president Goodluck Jonathan, seen voting in his home town at Ward 13 in Otuoke, Bayelsa state, on Saturday, has reportedly called General Buhari to congratulate him on his win . Buhari's fourth, and successful, bid for presidency was made possible by the  formation of a coalition of Nigeria's major opposition parties two years ago, the All Progressives Congress (APC). A united opposition and its choice of Buhari as a single candidate presented the first real opportunity in the history of Nigeria to oust a sitting president. Buhari has also been able to count on considerable voter dissatisfaction with the performance of Goodluck Jonathan, who has been president since 2010, and his failure to take proper action against Boko Haram. In Kano state, where Boko Haram's guerilla war on the civilian population has been most prominent, Buhari delivered a crushing defeat to Jonathan, winning 1.9 million votes for Jonathan's 215,800. This came despite Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau vowing to disrupt the election, which the group sees as 'un-Islamic', prompting unprecedented security measures at polling stations. Buhari has promised to stamp out the insurgency in the north, which has seen the Islamist group murder tens of thousands of civilians, kidnap hundreds of young girls and force more than 1.5 million people from their homes. When Buhari's win was announced, spontaneous celebrations sprang up in Kano, the nation's second city, and Kaduna in Kano state. Many brandished the wicker broom, symbol of Buhari's APC coalition, which claims it will sweep Africa's most populous country clean years of government mismanagement and corruption. Crowds were heard chanting 'change, change' as hundreds of people climbed onto rooftops to watch the celebrations. Drivers performed stunts, filling the air with thick smoke, as veiled women and the crowds shouted 'Sai Buhari' (Only Buhari) in celebration.

While the topic of the government's response to militant group Boko Haram has been a significant electoral topic, provision of basic services such as electricity and water remains an important election issue . Residents watch the vote count on a television set in Kaduna,  Nigeria Tuesday . 'We must see this as a triumphant show of democracy, a change for the better,' Buhari's wife Aisha Buhari said in one of a series of jubilant Twitter messages. Earlier today a U.S. official said said The United States is ready to work with anyone democratically elected as Nigeria's president. 'I would reiterate that the U.S. is ready to work with . whichever candidate the Nigerian people elect through the . democratic process,' the U.S. State Department official said. 'Buhari has peacefully contested the last few presidential . elections and accepted the results of those votes, even when he . questioned the credibility of the process,' the U.S. official . said. The official said Buhari's leadership of the opposition . suggests a commitment to democracy as part of a new era in . Nigeria that began after military rule ended in 1999. Buhari's APC declared Buhari's victory over Jonathan's People's Democratic Party (PDP) this afternoon, but the incumbent president has yet to make any official comments on the election result. Earlier today, an APC spokesperson said Buhari fears his victory could be stolen by 'tricks' from the government. 'As for the election, we have won it!' Garba Shehu said outside the APC headquarters. Accusing Goodluck Jonathan's government of possibly meddling with the election results, he added: 'We are not out of the woods yet, we don't know what tricks the government is going to play.' Because of decades of military dictatorship, this is only the eighth election since the country won independence from Britain in 1960, and the fifth since democracy was restored in 1999.","Muhammadu Buhari has won the Nigerian presidential elections .

"The driver of a pickup truck that crashed into the side of a house in Salt Lake City acknowledged drinking 36 beers and doing cocaine before the accident. No one was hurt in the early morning crash at a house on the city's west side. However, the homeowner's dog was in the living room and received scratches as Bernabe Urcino-Saldago, 39, and his vehicle hurtled into the home just after 9am Monday morning. No one was injured in the crash caused when Bernabe Urcino-Saldago, 39, allegedly drank 36 beers and did cocaine before missing a turn and driving into a neighbor's home . 'If anyone had been up and around like we normally are during the day, chances are he probably would have run one of us over,' the family's son Mario Gutierrez said. 'I don't know how the dog survived. The dog's bed now has a couch and a coffee table on (it).' 'I slapped him in the face three or four good times, as hard as I could. He woke up, looked at me briefly, mumbled something and then passed out again,' he told KSL, . Gutierrez said he recognized Urcino-Saldago from the neighborhood when he saw the man over the steering wheel with his foot still on the gas pedal. Gasoline was leaking from the truck into the family's living room. The driver, who smelled of alcohol, is thought to have missed a turn at the end of the street before crashing into the house and waking up its inhabitants with a bang. The driver, who told officers what he had to drink after failing a field sobriety test, was arrested on suspicion of DUI, negligent collision and driving without a license . He said that he consumed two 18-packs of beer. A probable cause statement says Urcino-Saldago told police what he had consumed after he failed a field sobriety test early Monday. The 39-year-old was arrested on suspicion of DUI, negligent collision and driving without a license. Urcino-Saldago has a previous misdemeanor conviction for not having a license in 2010. He received probation. The truck, which went through a small retaining wall outside, did not hit any load bearing walls, Salt Lake police detective Greg Wilking told the Deseret News. Gutierrez and his family expect to be able to stay in the house. The vehicle also hit a tree.

"A 21-year-old woman has regular brushes with death and in one year was pronounced clinically dead 36 times. Sara Brautigam was four years ago diagnosed with Postural orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS), a condition which makes her heart race while standing upright. She experiences rapid palpitations that regularly cause her heart to stop beating and her blood pressure to plummet to what doctors record as clinically dead. Ms Brautigam said that she has contacted other people with the same condition, but none of those people's hearts have stopped . 'They can't give me CPR because CPR tires the heart out for no reason so it is pointless. When the heart fills up with blood again is when it begins beating again. 'The blood tends to pool in my legs and the doors need to help feed it back to the heart.' 'I can't have oxygen because it prolongs the attack. 'In fact it is just a case of leaving me there and praying. The only thing they can do is put me on a drip,' she added. Ms Brautigam, from Doncaster, said each time her heart stops medics have to inflict pain on her to shock her into coming back to life. She said: 'When it happens paramedics try and do anything to inflict pain to try and shock me into coming back to life. Ms Brautigam lies in a hospital bed after undergoing one of her regular episodes caused by her heart condition . Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) can be a life altering and debilitating chronic health condition. Simply standing up can be a challenge for people with PoTS as their body is unable to adjust to gravity. PoTS is characterised by what's known as orthostatic intolerance - the development of symptoms when upright that are relieved by lying down. Symptoms include headaches, fatigue, palpitations, sweating, nausea, fainting and dizziness. They are associated with an increase in heart rate from the lying to upright position of greater than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate of greater than 120 beats per minute within 10 minutes of standing. For more information: http://www.potsuk.org/ . 'A lot of the time I'll wake up with big bruises. On one occasion they ripped an acrylic nail off but that still didn't make me flinch.' Ms Brautigam said that she has contacted people with PoTS, but none of those people's hearts have stopped. She also suffers joint hypermobility syndrome which means her joints are more prone to injury and dislocation. The two combined resulted in her visiting A&E a staggering 64 times in one year. 'When I was still canoeing I had an attack in my boat and when I came around I was screaming before I knew it because I had somehow dislocated my shoulder and damaged my back while I was passed out.' But Ms Brautigam - who has canoed for Great Britain - says she is determined not to let the conditions hold her back and is now trying to make a life as a burlesque performer. She said: 'There are signs before it happens - I'll feel dizzy or sick and really tired and then I feel as though I'm falling asleep.I can hear everything around me and feel as though I'm trying to shout but nothing is coming out. 'They say when you die your hearing is the last thing to go and that's been my experience. After an attack I'll wake up and my chest will be killing and I'm really tired. 'I get asked it quite a lot, but there is definitely no bright light. Everything just goes black. 'You can still hear things and there is a voice in my head that is still active and still conscious and it is trying to communicate with those around me. I can remember what people are saying when I black out but have no other awareness of what's going on.' She was told she could no longer take part in the sport and her dreams of joining the Navy were also left in tatters. Even getting a job and and driving were affected by the condition. She added: 'I had 10 years of being out every weekend canoeing and being so active and it all came crashing down. I piled on the weight because I couldn't exercise and was really upset. 'All my dreams came crashing down, I can't even work at the minute because I would need a job that could be very flexible. Then I was told I couldn't drive, it was like everything was being taken away from me. 'I lost a lot of friends, in fact I only have one friend from school. Everyone seemed to be too busy with their own lives to bother with me when I was diagnosed.'","The 21-year-old has regular brushes with death due to rare heart condition .
