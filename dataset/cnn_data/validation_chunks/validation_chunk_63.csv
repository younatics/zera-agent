"US ambassador Mark Lippert, 42, was discharged from hospital after being attacked by a knife-wielding activist . The US ambassador to South Korea who was slashed across the face by an activist, said he was 'pretty darn good' as he was released from hospital. Mark Lippert suffered a deep facial gash and stab wound to his wrist after being attacked by a knife-wielding pro-North Korean activist during a breakfast forum in Seoul last week. Speaking as he left Seoul's Severance Hospital the ambassador said he felt 'pretty darned good, all things considered,' after the 'scary incident.' The 42-year-old, whose face was bandaged and had his arm in a brace, needed 80 stitches after being set upon. Mr Lippert refused to comment about the attack as he left hospital due to the on-going police investigation. The alleged attacker, known as an anti-U.S. activist who was previously convicted of hurling a piece of concrete at the Japanese ambassador in Seoul in 2010, was arrested at the scene. Police are seeking to bring charges including attempted murder against Kim Ki-jong, 55, for the attack at a forum discussing Korean reunification. Police said the motive for Kim's action was not known, but he shouted after the attack that he opposes the ongoing annual U.S.-South Korea military drills that North Korea condemns as a preparation for a northward invasion. Mark Lippert suffered a deep facial gash and stab wound to his wrist after being attacked by a knife wielding pro-North Korean during a breakfast forum in Seoul last week . The 42-year-old needed 80 stitches to the deep knife wound to his face after the attack . As he left Seoul's Severance Hospital he said he felt 'pretty darned good, all things considered,' after the 'scary incident. Right before:  Lippert pictured above, seated at the breakfast table just prior to being attacked by Kim Thursday morning . Seoul and Washington call the drills defensive and routine. The anti-US activist has denied that he intended to kill Lippert. As part of the police investigation officers have requested Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government. Kim also attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said. The attack prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice.' Lippert had become known for an approachable, informal style since taking up his posting in Seoul in November and after the attack questions were raised about his security arrangements. Previously, Lippert was guarded by a single, unarmed South Korean policeman in plain clothes. He refused to discuss possible new security arrangements, except to say U.S. officials would take 'a hard look' at procedures in South Korea and then make a decision, as he left hospital. 'We have made it our mission to be open and friendly and that will not change,' said Mr Lippert at the press conference. Suspect: Police are seeking to bring charges including attempted murder against Kim Ki-jong, 55, pictured, for the attack . The alleged attacker, who was arrested on Friday last week, and is said to be known as an anti-US activist . Police said the motive for Kim's action was not known, but he shouted demands for Korean reunification . Doctor's removed 80 stitches needed to close the deep wound on the ambassador's face, Severance's general director Yoon Do-heum told reporters. He said the ambassador still feels some pain in his arm, but it is manageable with medicine. He may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months. The United States is South Korea's closest ally andmaintains a military presence of 28,500 personnel. While thathas drawn protest from some South Koreans in the past,opposition has eased in recent years. Aftermath:  Lippert appeared on Thursday wrapped in a neck bandage after being treated for his injuries, which include slashing wounds and nerve damage . Pro-US: While South Korea is one of America's strongest allies in Asia, there are factions of the country against the strong US military presence .","US ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert discharged from hospital .

Participants gather en masse in town centre to party and kiss, in an event that is believed to ensure good health and prosperity to all those taking part, as well as protecting the village from bad luck during the year ahead. Scroll down for video . Every year thousands of locals gather in the streets to take part in the kissing ritual - known as omed omedan - in Denpasar . The so-called kissing ritual happens one day after Balinese Hindus celebrate the Nyepi Day of Silence, marking the start of the new year . It's believed the ritual brings good health and prosperity to those taking part, as well as protecting the village from bad luck . And just in case participants get a little too amorous, village priests are on hand with buckets of water to dampen the passions of lustful couples in the usually conservative country. The ritual - which translates into 'pull, pull' - is believed to have started around 100 years ago as way for village youths to mark the first day of the new year. It's not clear when, or why, mass kissing became incorporated into the tradition. Omed omedan traditionally involves unmarried villagers, aged 17 to 30, and begins with prayer before the kissing begins.

"Virtual reality gaming is coming 'this year,' Facebook's chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer has promised. The release date for the firm's Oculus headset has been shrouded in secrecy until now. He also said people would be able to game in VR on 'something' shipped by Oculus - and said work was progressing well on Facebook plan to build drones to give internet access to underdeveloped nations. Scroll down for video . The move will allow users to see 360 degree videos using the Oculus Rift headset (pictured) The latest prototype of Facebook's headset . Schroepfer showed off what appears to be an advanced version of Eve: Valkyrie, a game that puts users in the cockpit of a spaceship on stage at day two of the social network's F8 Developer Conference in San Francisco on Thursday. 'Why is VR going to work now, when it didn't work in the '80s and '90s?' asked Schroepfer. 'Because the technology is more advanced than before and ready for primetime, he said. 'Each one of these core tracks of technology had to hit a minimum core viability...to get to that sense of presence to sense that you're truly there.' 'You're going to be able to do it in something shipped by Oculus,' Schroepfer said. 'This is going to be incredible.' 'VR is more than just another platform, it can create a whole range of human experiences,' said Michael Abrash, the Chief Scientist at Oculus. 'VR has the potential to change just about everything about the way we live.' He also reveald the firm thought drones were key to getting connectivity around the world. 'This basically mean going to the sky,' Schroepfer says. He showed off the Aquila, an Internet-connected unmanned drone with the wingspan of a 737 and the 'mass of a small car.' It would fly over regions of the developing world, sprinkling Internet access like so much rain. The drones, flying at 65,000ft (19,800 metres), will be capable of staying in the air for months. They are relatively cheap and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals. Yael Maguire, engineering director of Facebook’s Connectivity Lab, has previously told the Social Good Summit that the planes will be ‘roughly the size’ of a Boeing 747, but much lighter than the popular aeroplane, which weighs around 600,000lbs (272,155kg) without passengers or fuel. Facebook previously said the drones will be 'relatively cheap' - although did not specify a cost - and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals. Facebook has revealed more details about its plans to provide web access to the world. Drones as large as jumbo jets are set to extend the reach of Wi-Fi around the world. They will be powered by the sun and hover some 65,000 feet (19,800 metres) above the ground . The California-based tech giant has joined forces with Nokia, Qualcomm, Samsung and other tech firms to develop the planes in an initiative called Internet.org. Today, around 2.7 billion people have access to the internet, which is just one third of the global population. The members of the initiative said in a report that connecting the world is 'one of the fundamental challenges of our time' and they plan to do it using a variety of technologies, including drones. 'When people have access to the internet, they can not only connect with their friends, family and communities, but they can also gain access to the tools and information to help find jobs, start businesses, access healthcare, education and financial services and have a greater say in their societies. 'They get to participate in the knowledge economy,' the report said. The drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on Earth. Schroepfer said the company will have more information to share on Aquila later this year. Yesterday Facebook said it is to begin supporting virtual reality on its newsfeed, with users able to put on a VR headset and explore a virtual location. The social network announced that users will be able to view videos filmed with multiple cameras, and move the viewpoint in order to explore a location. The innovation is being showcased at the firm's F8 developers' conference in San Francisco under the name Teleportation Station - a name that was leaked via an app notification this morning. The  videos are shot with twenty-four cameras working in parallel. 'You can move around inside the video,' Mark Zuckerberg said, 'and view it from different angles.' The company is demonstrating the new video format for attendees at this week's F8 conference by showing off a 24-camera-view of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. On a desktop computer, it is controlled by a mouse. However,  the company describes its spherical videos as a 'first step' toward even more immersive videos that we'll view through virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift, which straps over your eyes and provide the illusion of stepping inside a digital environment. 'You're going to be able to put on your Oculus headset,' Zuckerberg said, 'and view spherical videos there too.' He also announced that users will soon be able to share content from third-party apps in their Messenger - Facebook's instant messaging service. Facebook aims to use a mix of solar-powered aircraft and low-orbit satellites to beam signals carrying the internet to hard-to-reach locations. The drones, flying at 65,000ft (19,800 metres), will be capable of staying in the air for months. They are relatively cheap and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals. The drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on Earth. Low-orbit and geosynchronous satellites, which have orbits that match the Earth’s rotation and are effectively stationary, will cover more remote areas in Africa and Asia. The internet access would be transmitted in the form of free-space optical communication, or FSO, which transmits data using infrared laser beams. 'One of the fastest growing and most important members of our family is Messenger,' said Mr Zuckerberg. 'Facebook used to be this single blue app and it did a lot of different things, now Facebook is a family of apps,' he said. 'Moving from being a single service to a family of apps is the biggest shift we've made in our strategy in helping connect people.' The Messenger Platform was also launched, allowing developers to build new services into the app, which is used by 600 million users each month. Mr Zuckerberg said it would give users 'more tools for expression'. The new Platform will give users the chance to communicate directly with businesses, for example to change an order as well as track its delivery. Facebook's David Marcus, vice president of messaging products, took to the stage to confirm that apps like ESPN have already built apps that will now be supported in Messenger. Over 40 apps will be launched in the coming days, he confirmed. The initial kit for developers to build their software into Messenger will be available from today, though no general release date has yet been confirmed. Mr Marcus also spoke of Facebook's desire to revolutionise online shopping by allowing users to receive real-time shopping updates via Messenger. This will start a message thread with the brand a user has shopped with, so they can track and alter an order via an instant message conversation. Users can then send a thumbs-up to confirm an order. It will begin rolling out in the 'next few weeks', according to Mr Marcus. 'It's time for us to reinvent how people and business communicate,' he said. Ilya Sukhar, from the social media site's Parse department, the area of Facebook made for developers, also announced that the social network will begin supporting software development kits (SDKs) for the 'internet of things'. This is the idea that all a person's smart devices can be connected together, enabling developers to create apps for Facebook that can control part of the home. Facebook is trying to mould its Messenger app into a more versatile communications channel as smartphones create new ways for people to connect with friends and businesses beyond the walls of the company's ubiquitous social network. To pull it off, Facebook is opening Messenger so outside programmers can build features tailored for the service. Messenger will also be adding the ability to display store receipts and shipping information to help consumers keep track of their interactions with merchants and other businesses. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg touted the Messenger expansion Wednesday during his opening speech at a two-day conference for developers in San Francisco. The push to plant more features in Messenger underscores the growing importance of apps that enable more intimate and direct conversations than social networks. The example of receiving a notification when a garage door is opened was demonstrated on-stage. The F8 developers' conference, which is being attended by more than 3,000 Facebook app developers, is the social network's only major live show of the year. The company, which has more than 1.3 billion monthly users, also unveiled a range of new tools for advertisers, including new analytics tools to monitor ad campaigns. 'All of you are the ones building the services that are unleashing this new wave of expression,' said Mr Zuckerberg, as he returned to the stage. 'It's really our honour to serve you and to be on this journey together. Let's go connect the world,' he said.","Facebook recently bought virtual reality headset make Oculus .

Above, Albert is dressed in a dalmatian costume . 'Albert is definitely getting more used to dressing up for photos now. 'It takes around 30 to 45 minutes to take a photo of him but that's only the start. 'I then have all the work leading up to it, shopping for an outfit, thinking of ideas, researching props - then afterwards I have to edit the photos. 'The whole thing can take around three to four hours per photo.' Albert already has nearly 20 costumes. 'I put him in a costume one day just for fun and it looked so cute I felt that I had to share it with everybody, added Christine. The cute kitten is dressed in a American football shirt and poses with a ball in one of his many shoots . Miss Look even made Albert dress like a character from Breaking Bad by putting him in goggles and a protective jacket. She then placed him on a pile of fake money next to a container with blue liquid . In one of the shoots Miss Look ventured to Hollywood Boulevard where she placed Albert on 'The Munchkins' star . Albert, pictured left in 'bed', also had a kitten-sized pink and white moped bought for him by Miss Look .

"Getting to Mars is no easy feat: the journey of several hundred million miles takes about nine months, one-way, and a manned mission will likely in total take about three years. So one scientist took a look at different types of propulsion - including nuclear - to find out if there was a quicker way to get there. But it seems that, aside from an engineering breakthrough, we can’t really shorten these times - and he thinks it’s unlikely we’ll send humans within five decades, not the 2030s as Nasa believes. Dr Bertolami from the University of Porto was speaking to MailOnline. He studied different types of propulsion that could get humans to Mars (shown). In total a manned mission would last three to four years, which poses major problems, such as exposure to radiation . Theoretical physicist Dr Orfeu Bertolami from the University of Porto, together with his colleagues Dr André Guerra and Dr Paulo Gil, carried out a study comparing different space propulsion methods for a manned mission to Mars. Option 1 - A 'giant leap' from moon to Mars . - Return to the moon . - Build a lunar base . - Send humans to the surface of Mars . Option 2 - Least technological risk . - Send humans into lunar orbit . - Visit an asteroid in its own orbit . - Return to the moon's surface . - Explore Martian moons Deimos and Phobos . - Enter orbit around Mars . - Land on the red planet . Option 3 - Nasa's current favoured path . - Robotically capture an asteroid . - Place it in lunar orbit for astronauts to visit . - Travel to the moons of Mars . - Place humans in Martian orbit . - Set foot on Mars . Based on the team’s calculations, they found that the total mission time poses serious problems to a potential manned mission. In total the mission will last three to four years, which is ‘very demanding’ and ‘almost impossible’ according to Dr Bertolami. ‘Despite what people say, we are a long way from reaching Mars,’ he told MailOnline. One particular issue is radiation. Astronauts on a mission to and from Mars will be outside of Earth’s magnetic field, and thus the risk of harm is much higher than when in Earth orbit. Nasa’s proposal is to send a mission there and back, but Dr Bertolami said more infrastructure was needed to make the mission possible. ‘I see no way of reaching Mars in five decades,’ said Dr Bertolami. ‘I don’t believe one can reach Mars through a brute force approach. ‘You have to be able to create complicated and sophisticated means of avoiding these hazards.’ He added: ‘There are too many thing we don’t know, obstacles in travel and in the technology itself, and the mass budgets for a mission are immense. ‘I would like to be a bit more optimistic, but I’m afraid this is how it is.’ Various forms of propulsion have been touted for a mission to Mars, including chemical, ion (electric) and nuclear. But while nuclear is often said to be the 'holy grail', the team found it did not noticeably shorten the mission over other versions. Shown is an illustration of a concept Mars Transfer Vehicle . Dr Bertolami, who was also part of a  science committee for Esa's satellite navigation programme Galileo, instead suggests that we should consider returning to the lunar surface and improving our technologies, before attempting a mission to the red planet. Owing to the orbits of Earth and Mars there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place. Our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles (54.6 million km), but can be as distant as 250 million miles (400 million km). For this reason spacecraft to Mars, such as the Curiosity rover, have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned. The next window is open from January 2016 to April 2016, and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet. For a future manned mission, they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in one, which will take two years in total. Just getting there will take up to nine months. The astronauts will be there waiting for a year until they can come back - a total of around three years. ‘From my point of view we should get back to moon, and I think it would be extremely useful to start with habitats at the moon,’ he said. ‘Once you can reach the moon on a regular basis, we will have learned a lot of things to achieve that. ‘I would never consider Mars before reaching this scientific level.’ In their study, the researchers looked at other methods of propulsion to see if there was any way to make a Mars mission more feasible in the near future. ‘Reaching Mars is a complicated business, and you have to start with a strategy,’ Dr Bertolami said. For their study, they chose a mission plan that was similar to the Apollo moon missions. The astronauts would start in low Earth orbit, then go to Mars and land, then return from Martian orbit and land on Earth. They looked at four different kinds of propulsion - chemical, ion, nuclear and a concept electromagnetic engine. Shown is a graph of the different types of propulsion for a mission to Mars, how much they would weigh and their travel time. CECE is a type of chemical propulsion, Nerva is nuclear propulsion, RIT-XT is ion (electric) propulsion and PEMT is Pure Electro-Magnetic Thrust . But while a nuclear engine is often touted as the holy grail of space travel, the team found that for a mission to Mars, there was no benefit in such an engine. While it might be slightly faster, the mission time is still similar overall, but such an engine would cost and weight a lot more. Nasa actually attempted to build a nuclear-powered engine before, known as Nerva (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application), with a view to using it to get to Mars, but the programme was scrapped in 1972. In fact, the best way to reach Mars was a combination of chemical and ion engines - the former to reach orbit, on a rocket, and the latter for the cruise to Mars. Nasa actually attempted to build a nuclear-powered engine before, known as Nerva (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application), shown in this illustration, with a view to using it to get to Mars, but the programme was scrapped in 1972 . According to Dr Bertolami and his team, the best way to reach Mars was a combination of chemical and ion (shown) engines - the former to reach orbit, on a rocket, and the latter for the cruise to Mars . ‘Most people say that nuclear is helpful,’ he continued. ‘It makes the flight time much shorter and the mass budget is lower. But it turns out basically that’s not really the case.’ One of the proposals for nuclear propulsion is that a reactor could emit particles onto a giant sail, which would propel the craft forwards. This is similar to a solar sail but ‘you carry your sun with you,’ said Dr Bertolami. Dr Bertolami says a problem arises because, while nuclear propulsion could accelerate to quite high speeds, it needs to brake again to enter orbit around the red planet. While it might be able to reach higher speeds for a mission to Mars over chemical and ion propulsion, the amount it would have to brake means that it doesn't really reduce the time of the mission by any considerable margin. And the weight of hoisting a nuclear reactor into orbit, coupled with the cost, does not make it an attractive option. Chemical propulsion is currently the only way to get from Earth into orbit, so any mission to Mars will have to still rely on it. Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, illustrated, for example will use a combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to take a Mars-bound spacecraft into orbit . ‘At the end of the day, if you do the calculations properly, you find out that traditional measures like chemical and electrical turn out to be more efficient,’ he said. ‘That’s rather surprising.’ However, looking further into the future, Dr Bertolami said if humans were to travel beyond Mars - such as to a moon of Jupiter - then nuclear propulsion becomes feasible. ‘Beyond Mars then the issue is indeed to do it as fast as possible, and then I would think that nuclear propulsion would turn out to be the most interesting one,’ he said. ‘I think for this particular case, nuclear propulsion will be the best option. ‘But again, I think we are still a long way to reaching that.’","Dr Bertolami from the University of Porto was speaking to MailOnline .

"Nick Clegg (above) launched an outspoken pre-election attack on the Tories, who he has spent five years sharing power with . Nick Clegg today launched an outspoken pre-election attack on the Tories he has spent five years sharing power with. The Lib Dem leader used his final conference speech before polling day to mock the 'red-faced bluster of right-wing Tories', compare David Cameron to 'Nigel Farage in White tie', and declare: 'Cows moo. Dogs bark. And Tories cut.' In a desperate plea to be returned to power after May 7, he warned the Tories would not be fair and Labour would ruin the economy. Addressing delegates in Liverpool, Mr Clegg urged his party to 'think big', hailing Britain as an 'open-hearted, open-minded, optimistic country'. Mr Clegg, who was joined on stage by his wife Miriam, said there was nowhere in the world like the UK 'nowhere as gutsy, nowhere as hopeful, nowhere as welcoming'. 'We are a small island, but we are a big, big country,' he added. But he warned this was threatened by Labour and the Conservatives abandoning the centre ground. After years of austerity, he insisted there was now 'light at the end of the tunnel'. 'While the job of fixing our economy is not over yet, the end is in sight.' He said austerity could end in three years' time, but claimed that the Tories wanted to continue cutting public spending far beyond what was necessary. He claimed that 'everywhere you look there is blame and division', including Ukip pandering to fear and Tory Home Secretary Theresa May sending out vans telling migrants to 'Go Home'. And he took aim at the Chancellor, with whom he has spent the last week negotiating the details of Wednesday's Budget. Wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez (left) and women's minister Jo Swinson (right) listen to the speech . In the speech Clegg claimed that 'everywhere you look there is blame and division', including Ukip pandering to fear and Tory Home Secretary Theresa May sending out vans telling migrants to 'Go Home' He pointed to the 'glint in George Osborne's eye as he announced that the working age poor will bear the brunt of the cuts'. He launched the direct attack on his coalition partners by claiming they posed a  threat to education by refusing to protect pre-school and college funding. 'Cows moo. Dogs bark. And Tories cut. It's in their DNA,' he said. The Lib Dems and Tories have clashed over Mr Osborne's plan to rule out any future tax rises and tackle the deficit through cuts alone, including taking another £12billion out of the welfare budget. Mr Clegg claimed this would mean eight million families on the lowest wages would be £1,500 worse off. He said the Tories had refused to target the wealthy, describing them as 'their friends in big business and big houses'. 'They're not even pretending they want us to be ""all in this together"" any more. 'The Conservative plan for the next government is an ideological lurch to the right. 'They have gone from being the self-proclaimed heirs to Blair to Nigel Farage in white tie. 'And yet they have the gall to say they are staying on the road to recovery. 'They are not staying on the road, they are veering off it.' Ms Gonzalez Durantez hugged her husband before joining him on stage after the keynote speech . Clegg, pictured with Ms Gonzalez Durantez after the speech, also turned his fire on the Labour Party, claiming the most interesting thing they have done is 'buy a pink van' A Lib Dem delegate falls asleep clutching a pile of leaflets during the opening of the session this morning . He said Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne cannot have it both ways, claiming the government has done the right thing and then calling for drastic changes. 'Either we are doing the right thing or we aren't. If we are then why won't you stick with it? 'I'll tell you why: because left to their own devices the Conservatives will cut public services, take away support from the poor and look after their own kind in a way they haven't been able to do in this Government because we were there to stop them.' He also turned his fire on the Labour Party, claiming the most interesting they have done is 'buy a pink van'. He said Ed Miliband's pledge card to voters, launched yesterday, contained £70billion of extra borrowing. 'It's not a pledge card, it's a credit card and you, me and every other British taxpayer will be paying the bill for years to come.' He warned the liberal values of modern Britain would be under threat if either the Tories or Labour attempted to govern with the support of a 'rag tag mob' of MPs from Ukip or the SNP. Despite dire polls suggesting Lib Dems could lose more than half of their seats, Mr Clegg insisted his party was 'here to stay'. The Lib Dem leader walks with his wife  ahead of his keynote speech on the final day of the party's spring conference in Liverpool . He ruled out being part of a formal coalition deal involving either the SNP or Ukip, although aides would not reject the idea of those parties being involved in a looser confidence and supply arrangement.

"Aleysha McLoughlin was an aspiring lawyer and tipped to get A grades at her GCSEs, but she struggled with a history of self harm and was found hanged - with scars on her arms and thighs that read 'hate' and 'fat' A promising teenager tipped to achieve straight A grades in her GCSEs was found dead with the words 'fat' and 'hate' etched into her arm. Aspiring lawyer Aleysha McLoughlin, 16, had been living with her foster mother Beverley Sharples in Bolton and was found hanged. Just 24 hours before the teenager, who had a history of self harming, had been taken to A&E at Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester where a medic told her she was 'having a bad day.' After her death scars were found on Aleysha's arms and thighs, which may have been many years old, and spelled out the words 'hate', 'fat' and 'ruin', Bolton Coroners' Court heard. An inquest into the GCSE student's death heard she had been taken from her parents due to their drug addiction and initially lived with her great-aunt. She flourished at school where she was tipped for straight A grades at GCSE and competed for head girl status. But when she was 14 her sister Karly got in touch through Facebook and said she wanted to meet. The pair did so and as they grew closer and began having contact with their biological mother Gaynor Rothwell. At one stage she disappeared for three and the teenager's behaviour deteriorated. She was later moved into foster care in November 2012. From March 2013 Aleysha began running away from home for days at a time and would often be found with her 19-year-old sister. The two even staged a 'rooftop protest' on a care centre at one point in a bid to be housed closer together. The inquest heard that there had been numerous attempts by social workers to help the teenager, and her foster mother Beverley Sharples had taken her to hospital after she took an overdose. But Aleysha refused help. Mrs Sharples added that on February 8 last year after enjoying a 'normal family night in' with a takeaway, Aleysha had gone to meet her sister. But shortly after the pair leaving she received a phone call from the police saying the pair had been caught trying to jump off a nearby bridge but were stopped before they had the chance. On April 2 last year Mrs Sharples received a call from St Catherine's Academy in Bolton saying the teenager had been self harming, and she took her to Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester. Mrs Sharples told the inquest: 'I phoned the paramedics and they suggested we go. She wasn't happy about going. She was assessed in A&E then sent to another bit of the hospital and the nurse also asked if she wanted to speak to someone while she was there. The teenager had been taken into care after she began getting into trouble with her sister . 'Surprisingly she said yes which is a massive step because she had refused up until then. A man from the RAID team took her to a room and she was in there for one hour and ten minutes and I wasn't allowed in. 'He said she wouldn't engage. She said it was a waste of time and he said 'I was having a bad day'. 'Before she went to sleep she was really upset. I asked what she was crying for and she said 'I'm sorry, you have been in the hospital with me for five-and-a-half hours, I'm a pain in the bum.' I said yes but you're my pain in the bum.' The medic was thought to have been unaware of Aleysha's scars at this stage. The next morning, Aleysha came downstairs at 10am, but did not want any breakfast. Mrs Sharples asked if she wanted to go with her to Horwich but instead Aleysha went back to bed. Aleysha's foster mother had taken her to Royal Bolton Hospital after she self harmed and a medic told the teenager that she was 'having a bad day.' The next day Aleysha, 16, was found hanged in her bedroom . Aleysha  lived with her great aunt for years after being taken from her parents because of their drug addiction . The foster mother said Aleysha had fitted in well at their home and the two had been getting close. Mrs Sharples left the house and returned at around 2pm after running some errands. When she went upstairs to check on Aleysha some time later she found her body. Pathologist Dr Charles Wilson told the inquest that there were scars on the teenager's arms and thighs, and some spelled out words. He said: 'On her left thigh were the words ruin and fat. The cuts would have taken at least a couple of months to reach the stage I saw. They could have been years old. 'A wound to her upper arm spelled the word hate.' Ms Sharples said foster children were always told to cover their bodies when in their foster homes in accordance with safeguarding rules, and so she didn’t notice any signs of self-harming. Flowers and tributes were left to Aleysha after she was found hanged in her bedroom on April 3 . Bolton Coroners' Court heard that the teenager had repeatedly refused to engage with social workers . The teenager's great aunt Carol Kerfoot had cared for her from July 2003 until she was 14. She told the hearing she first saw some surface scratches on Aleysha's arms in November 2012 after she returned to the house from a short stint in foster care. 'They were surface scratches but when I talked about it she ran off upstairs and didn't want to discuss it,' she said. 'It was the only time I noticed self-harm. 'I found her to be a good child. She had some issues and sadly they led to the breakdown of our placement but she was a good child. She had a lot of friends and was beautiful inside and out. 'She always maintained she didn't want anything to do with her real parents but then she did. Her sister got in touch over Facebook and it snowballed from there.' The inquest, expected to last four days, continues.

"A man died after he dived into the path of a Tube train to try to save his younger brother who had jumped on to the tracks. Nick Mann, 35, was killed as he attempted to rescue Robert, 32, who is believed to have dropped his mobile or wallet on to the line at Old Street station in London. He tried to pull his brother to safety but suffered severe head injuries when a Northern line train ploughed into them both. Siblings: Nick Mann (left), 35, died after he was hit by a Northern line train at Old Street station in the early hours of Sunday - while trying to save his brother Robert Mann (right) who had jumped onto the tracks. The pair were taken to the Royal London Hospital where Nick, a writer from Wimbledon, died. Robert, who lives in Manchester, was yesterday in a stable but critical condition. Hours before the tragedy – just after midnight on Saturday night – Nick took a selfie with his brother at Fratton Park in Portsmouth where they had gone to watch their favourite football team Shrewsbury play the home team. Friends yesterday paid tribute to former Manchester University student Nick, who they said ‘would have done anything for anyone’. One friend, who did not want to be named, told the Evening Standard: ‘The fact that Nick passed away while saving his brother is the least surprising thing in all of this.

He loved two things in equal measure – music and football. He was one of the most passionate people I’ve ever known. He was a great dude.’ Josh Retallick, who had known Nick for eight years, said: ‘It was such a heroic act. I just hope his brother recovers.’ Eyewitnesses said the pair were hit by a train as Nick – who ran a rock music fanzine – desperately tried to pull his younger brother, who studied history at Manchester Metropolitan University, on to the platform. A Tube worker said: ‘The man dropped something down on to the track, a mobile phone or something, and then somehow he’s got into trouble down there. ‘This other person then tried to help him out and pull him up back on to the platform in time before the train came, but it wasn’t in time and they both got hit. It was pretty bad.’ Another said: ‘It happened at the back of the platform, just as the train pulls in, so maybe they didn’t realise how close the train was.’ British Transport Police described the incident as a ‘tragic accident’.

"Police say Melissa Ann Martinez, 40, provided her son and his prom date with drugs an alcohol . The mother of a Texas teenager accused of choking his girlfriend to death during rough sex on prom night has been arrested for allegedly supplying her son and his date with drugs and alcohol on prom night. Melissa Ann Martinez, 40, was arrested on Thursday and police say she gave her son Eddie M. Herrera, 18, and and his date Jacqueline Gomez, 17,  alcohol and drugs the night that Gomez died. Herrera, 18, was charged with aggravated assault  in January for the May death of Jacqueline Gomez of Houston, Texas, after he admitted to choking her during sex. The Houston Chronicle reports that Herrera told police he called his mom to help him dress  Gomez before calling police to tell them he woke to find her unresponsive. Miss Gomez, 17, was found in the hotel room of the North Houston Hyatt Hotel on May 17, 2014, the same venue where the prom had been held the previous night. Investigators said Herrera told authorities the couple went to the hotel room after attending the prom, drank alcohol and fell asleep. Herrera told police that his girlfriend had taken the painkiller hydrocodone and he admitted they both drank whiskey. The Chronicle reports that Herrera told conflicting stories to the cops about whether or not his girlfriend consented to him choking her. Herrera said he found Miss Gomez, a senior at MacArthur High School, unresponsive the following morning. Houston Fire Department personnel responded and pronounced her deceased. Her death was initially believed to be an overdose but the medical examiner could not confirm an exact cause. Charged: Eddie Herrera, pictured in January, was charged with aggravated assault for his role in the death of high school senior Jacqueline Gomez last May . Died on prom night:Jacqueline Gomez, 17, died on her prom night in May at a hotel in Houston, Texas. Her boyfriend has now been charged in connection with her death . The autopsy found that Gomez had deep hemorrhaging around her neck. She blood-alcohol level of .21, almost three times the state’s legal limit and also had hydrocodone in her system. Authorities said a further investigation led them to arrest Herrera. The motive and official cause of death remain under investigation, according a police statement. At the time of her death, Miss Gomez's devastated family and friends told the Houston Chronicle that she was 'not a party girl' and spent most of her time working at a grocery school when she was not studying. The teenager had plans of going to Lone Star College to become a pharmacy technician. Investigators said Herrera told authorities the two went to the hotel room at the North Houston Hyatt (pictured) after attending the prom, drank alcohol and fell asleep .","Eddie M.

"It has the reputation of being one of the best hangover cures around and is also one of the simplest cocktails to make. Now one American bar has taken things to a new level and paired their Bloody Mary with another staple of the morning after - 4lb of fried food. But Sobelman's Pub and Grill in Milwaukee Wisconsin, US, has topped their jug - dubbed the  Chicken Fried Bloody Beast - with a whole fried bird. A happy customer at Sobelman's Pub and Grill in Milwaukee Wisconsin, US, holds up the $50 Chicken Fried Bloody Beast: a jug of Bloody Mary topped off with a whole fried chicken . The super-size drink also comes embellished with cheese, sausage, pickles, olives, onion, mushrooms, asparagus, spring onions, shrimp, lemon, Brussels sprouts, tomato, celery and two Baconadoes . The crazy cocktail is served in a jug that is the size of four regular sized Bloody Marys. The drink, which is usually embellished with a celery stick, comes instead with a four-pound chicken. It is also garnished with  cheese, sausage, pickles, olives, onion, mushrooms, asparagus, spring onions, shrimp, lemon, Brussels sprouts, tomato, celery and two Baconadoes (skewers of bacon-wrapped jalapeno cheeseballs). The $50 (£33) Chicken Fried Bloody Beast is meant to be shared by four people. A portion of the sales will go to help hunger charities. 'Ten per cent of its sales go to Milwaukee's Hunger Task Force, an organisation fighting hunger and serving those less fortunate in our community,' a bar spokesman said. The item has been on the menu since 2014. And this isn't the first time the restaurant has been in the news for its crazy cocktail concoctions. In the ongoing quest for world's best burger, owner Dave Sobelman decided that a bacon cheeseburger perched on a Bloody Mary could be it. The Fully-Loaded, Cheeseburger-Bloody Mary was dreamed up by Mr Sobelman in 2012. The drink/burger creation is garnished with a prawn, Polish sausage, cheese, pickled asparagus and sticks of celery and costs $9 (£6). Mr Sobelman, who started the business with wife Melanie in 1999, previously told MailOnline that he originally came up with combination to get people talking on the pub's Facebook page. Mr Sobelman said: 'We are known for our Bloody Marys and so I decided to put a slider on the side.' After more than a decade at the helm, he is an expert in the burger trade and tweaked the Bloody Mary combination to perfect it. He added: 'I've stopped putting the bacon on it; it was causing the burger to slide down the cocktail stick. 'The best way is to put a slice of cheese on each side of the burger which sticks everything together.' It is not the only bar to experiment with food-filled cocktails though. Vancouver bar the Score on Davie sells a Caesar - the Canadian take on a Bloody Mary - that not only features a whole roast chicken, but also a burger, pulled pork Sriracha-glazed slider, onion rings, chicken wings, a pulled pork mac and cheese hotdog and even a brownie. Their effort is a monstrous 5,000 calories, costs $60 (£40)  and takes 20 minutes to put together. in 2012, bar owner Dave Sobelman also created the Fully-Loaded, Cheeseburger-Bloody Mary . The bar is run by Mr Sobelman, and his wife Melanie. It has been a firm fixture in Wisconsin since 1999 .","A $50 Bloody Mary offered at Sobelman's Pub and Grill in Wisconsin, US .

"A new test that can identify whether long-dead ancient humans had suffered from malaria could help scientists trace how the disease has evolved. Archaeologists at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, have developed a way of diagnosing the disease in skeletons thousands of years old. Scientists have used the technique to reveal that infants and toddlers found in a cemetery within an ancient Roman villa in Italy had died of the disease. Scroll down for video . The scientists scraped bone marrow from bone sample to search for telltale crystals of a molecule called hemozoin that show the person who the bone belonged to had been infected with the malaria parasite . The method could now be used to track the spread of malaria back to its first appearance in humans by examining other ancient skeletons for signs of the infection. Jamie Inwood, an archaeologist at Yale University who led the research team, said: 'The data set we build with this will be revolutionary for establishing the epidemiological curve for malaria in ancient societies. Attempts to develop a vaccine against malaria have been frustrated by the parasite's highly variable nature. The parasite also tends to hide within red blood cells, making it difficult for the immune system to spot. Scientists at the US National Institutes of Health claim to have created a potential vaccine that can protect against lethal strains of malaria. The vaccine, developed blood samples taken from Tanzanian children naturally resistant to the disease, works by imprisoning the Malaria-causing parasites inside the red blood cells they infect. The scientists pinpointed a protein called PfSEA-1 which the parasites need to escape from the red blood cells they infect. Scientists found that an antibody produced by the immune children hits the malaria parasite at a critical stage in its life-cycle by taking action against this protein. The researchers said that an experimental vaccine based on this idea protected mice in five trials and will be tested on lab monkeys beginning in the next four to six weeks. 'By understanding how this parasite reacted to societal shifts in the past, we can aid in predicting its future behavior. We can understand the way it has evolved.' Miss Inwood and her colleagues developed the test by identifying specific chemical signals and molecules that are found in the bones of people infected with malaria. They found that a large molecule called hemozoin, which is expelled as a waste product by the malaria Plasmodium parasite. Using X-ray defraction, Miss Inwood and her team found they were able to identify black crystalline lumps of the molecule in the bone marrow of bone samples. They tested the technique on the remains of 100 children buried in a cemetery within the ruins of Roman villa at Lugnano in Teverina, Italy. The bodies, which dated from 550AD, had been buried with heavy roof tiles to weigh them down. Miss Inwood said: 'Researchers from the University of Arizona had found burial practices that were throwbacks to pagan rituals. 'It was suspected there must have been an epidemic in the community that caused fever or fits.' With the help of Dr David Soren, an archaeologist at the University of Arizona, Miss Inwood was able to identify hemozoin in femur and humerus bone samples from the site - confirming they had been infected with malaria. Malaria is spread by blood sucking female mosquitoes like the Anopheles stephensi mosquito shown above . This electron micrograph shows a malarial sporozoite migrating through the cytoplasm of a mosquito cell . They were able to confirm that the test was accurate using a technique that searches for DNA of the pathogen. However, DNA extraction is not always possible and sometimes unreliable. Malaria is one of the world's biggest infectious killers, infecting around 200 million people every year and claiming the lives of more than 500,000. Not all Plasmodium parasites cause malaria in humans. One, known as Plasmodium falciparum, is responsible for most of the deaths while others like Plasmodium malariae cause a milder form of the disease. Plasmodium knowlesi rarely cause malaria in humans while other strains of the parasite only infect primates, other mammals or birds. The malaria parasite has a life cycle (above) that requires female mosquitoes to pass it between human hosts . Plasmodium falciparum is known to have been in existence for up to 100,000 years, but the population size did not increase until around 10,000 years ago. It is thought that the disease may have originally evolved in gorillas and then passed to humans, but the evidence for this is inconclusive. Professor Roderick McIntosh, an anthropologist at Yale University who also took part in the work, said the test could now help reveal when and where the disease first began infecting humans. He said: 'There is a constant evolution of this disease, because of changes in human populations and changes in the medicines we use to treat it. 'Knowing the history of the mechanisms by which malaria evolves is a very good thing. We want to put together enough data for a timeline of malaria in humans.'","Scientists at Yale University developed a new way of diagnosing malaria .

"The Italian model who has accused Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein of groping her has told friends she is 'not afraid' of the movie producer despite his fearsome reputation. Ambra Battilana, 22, went to the NYPD on Friday to allege that Weinstein, 63, had groped her breasts during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca offices in Manhattan, grabbed her thigh and tried to kiss her. Battilana 'knows that Harvey has money and power and that he's going to come after her,' a source told the New York Daily News. 'But she's confident. ...She's not afraid of Harvey.' Scroll down for more . Ambra Battilana, the Italian model who has accused Harvey Weinstein of groping her has told friends she is 'not afraid' of the movie producer despite his fearsome reputation . Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, (left) has accused Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein, 63, (pictured right leaving his home on Tuesday) of touching her breasts and thigh in Manhattan on Friday evening . The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with the father-of-five who has produced hit movies including Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech and Gangs Of New York . 'When she was describing what happened, her face became contorted,' said Mark Heller. 'It was that look of someone who was creeped out. 'She's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that.' Weinstein is alleged to have asked Battilana if her breasts were real before he groped her chest and asked for a kiss. The distraught model allegedly asked him to stop and then promptly left. Surveillance footage from outside the Tribeca office is being analyzed, according to police sources. Weinstein was reportedly interviewed by the NYPD Special Victims Squad on Saturday after going to the police precinct voluntarily. The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with father-of-five Weinstein . Italian newspapers in 2012 reported that Ambra Battilana (pictured) had made a rape complaint against a 70-year-old car dealer ex-boyfriend when she was under 18. The case was dismissed after she never showed up to talk to prosecutors about the allegations . No charges have been filed and he has promised full cooperation with the probe. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. Weinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past citing her involvement in Silvio Berlusconi's 'bunga-bunga' orgies in 2010 and reports in the Italian press that she had previously alleged to police that her 70-year-old boyfriend had raped her. Ambra Battilana's police statement, made in the Alba region of Italy in December 2010, was published in an Italian newspaper, where she said she was 'forced against my will' into having sex with the 'businessman of substantial means' for money when she was under 18. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable verify her claims. Miss Battilana met the wealthy, car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. The age of sexual consent is 14 in Italy but it is illegal to pay for sex or to have sex with a prostitute who is under the age of 18. The Italian newspaper, Il Giornale, quoted from her 2010 police statement, where she recalled meeting the businessman at an organized dinner. The statement read: 'He invited me to ride in his car. Upset by the invitation because of my inexperience and very young age, he induced me to accept out of politeness. Sources close to Harvey Weinstein told The New York Post's Page Six on Monday that the 22-year-old model's allegations were an attempt at 'blackmail' 'To my enormous embarrassment he began to ask me questions about my sexual preferences and to tell me about his erotic fantasies. 'Then as he started to caress my hand and left leg, he proposed that I become his 'playmate' and before I could oppose he gave me a bag with €2,000. He assured me that it was only an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month.' She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money. 'From that time on he began to demand sexual relations in compensation for the cash which happened once a week. I did not have the strength to get out of the vicious circle.' According to reports in Il Giornale, Miss Battilana's statement continued that a few days later 'the businessman took me to an apartment in his possession... under his domination, I went in'. She told the police that the businessman began 'to violate my every wish'. Afterwards, she received €2,000. Ten days later, the same thing happened and she received another €2,000 and the relationship continued in this manner. She said: 'With the money received I helped my mother and bought designer clothes, bags, shoes, furs, jewelry and more.' The former beauty queen has an international modeling career, shooting editorial campaigns in Europe and the U.S. for designers and magazines . Battilana allegedly previously witnessed a 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian premier Berlusconi (pictured) and offered testimony to Italian authorities . At Christmas, the 70-year-old spent €5000 on her at a large clothing store. 'I continued to feel uncomfortable about the situation', she said. But she got an apartment in the city center in which everything was paid for with the businessman's money, Il Giornale claimed. She said in her statement that she suffered the 'commodification of my person' and became 'aware of being used by a man who treated me like a prostitute'. The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Il Giornale newspaper is owned by the Berlusconi family. Miss Battilana gave statements to Italian authorities about disgraced Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi's 'bunga-bunga' orgies in 2010 to which she was invited as a Miss Italia contestant and aspiring model. Ambra's lawyer Patrizia Bugnano, a senator, started proceedings against Berlusconi in October last year for defamation after the ex-politician said that she 'brainwashed' or 'manipulated' the two girls. Miss Battilana also said never had sex for money during a 2012 court trial involving Berlusconi's sex parties. She has sued for damages over her image but it is unclear whether she has been awarded a financial sum. Italian newspapers in 2012 reported that Ambra Battilana had made a rape complaint against a 70-year-old car dealer, ex-boyfriend when she was under 18. The case was dismissed after she never showed up to talk to prosecutors about the allegations . Harvey Weinstein seen with a smile on his face as he enters his office building in New York City on Tuesday. The movie producer has been accused of groping a 22-year-old woman last Friday . After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, she began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. The 22-year-old recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie and has been used as a model by a number of different photographers including Marcello Cassano and Kat Irlin. Photographer Marcello Cassano, who previously dated Miss Battilana, told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday: 'Ambra has a magnetic beauty and a strong personality oriented mainly in success.' He added: 'She comes from a poor and not traditional family.' The former boyfriend also alleged that since the model was a minor, she has had problems in court, first over being paid by an older boyfriend and then in relation to Berlusconi. Of their relationship, Mr Cassano said: 'We were together for a year, breaking up at the end of Berlusconi's trial when she was claiming to receive a big amount of money as compensation. 'At that time I was hoping that she was able to change but I'm glad we broke up.' She established a new Twitter account on Monday and posted the message: 'Don't stop Dreaming just because you had a Nightmare.' Miss Battilana (left), a former beauty queen, allegedly previously witnessed a 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving Berlusconi and offered testimony to Italian authorities. Right, she is pictured leaving a Milan court with her lawyer in July 2013 . Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . The Manhattan District Attorney has yet to decide whether charges will be filed against Weinstein. Sex crimes detectives reportedly spoke with Miss Battilana on Monday. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 25 years his junior, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also have three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton which ended in 2004. New York Spring Spectacular show featuring The Rockettes is currently playing at Radio City Music Hall and was produced by Weinstein. The Hollywood heavyweight skipped the New York premiere of his latest movie, Women In Gold, at the Museum of Modern Art on Monday night where stars Helen Mirren and Katie Holmes were seen on the red carpet.

"An unconscious patient secretly raped in A&E by a male nurse who filmed the attack admitted today she tried to kill herself after police revealed her ordeal.

She had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home and showed her images of the attack in February 2012.

Crime scene: Hutchinson raped two women and Balicao raped another in the A&E department they worked in at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (pictured) She told the Daily Mirror: 'I said, ""That’s not me"" but I had my mum round and she said, ""That is you."" 'I cut my wrists a few weeks afterwards. I knew what I was doing but I think it must have been a cry for help. 'It could have been going on for years and there could be a hell of a lot more victims out there'. The woman, who has children, was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked by the nurse while unconscious. She had today described the fear of having to wait two weeks to discover if she had any sexually transmitted disease, which came back clear. She said she has panic attacks, suffers severe mood swings and has developed a problem with alcohol. Her partner and the father of the children said: 'I want to kill him (Hutchinson). I'm angry and I don't trust anyone these days.' It emerged today that the A&E has now been forced to treat unconscious patients in open areas after two nurses were able to rape patients there in the past decade. In 2010 nurse Oliver Balicao, 42, a married father-of-two, was jailed for nine years after he raped a 17-year-old patient in the A&E and attacked  another in her  bed while working at the same hospital. A senior hospital manager has said that Hutchinson’s crimes has led to a policy change where unconscious patients are now treated in one area with open visibility. But management today refused to explain how two staff in ten years were able to rape women in the hospital - feet away from staff and other patients. Caught on camera: This CCTV image shows Hutchinson, top, in the leisure centre where he was found to be spying on women, and his life of sexual crime was then revealed to police . A court heard yesterday how Hutchinson was 'addicted' to spying on women and children, and filmed his most serious attacks. The nurse even stole a medical camera from the hospital so he could film up a woman’s skirt as she stood by her sick friend’s bedside. Away from the hospital, Hutchinson volunteered as a paramedic at the trendy Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire where he groped two young women who had passed out in the medical tent. He also used the medical camera – which is routinely used by doctors to examine the internal organs of patients – to film girls as young as ten getting changed at his local leisure centre. The nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, saw him lurking near the women’s changing rooms and raised the alarm. Hutchinson was arrested in November 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre. Detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone, computer, a memory stick and a camera. They also found 1,786 indecent images of children on his computer and phone. Hutchinson appeared at Oxford Crown Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to all 28 charges put to him. He admitted two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity, 12 counts of voyeurism, five counts of making indecent images of children, one count of outraging public decency, two counts of theft and one count of possession of a Class B drug. The court heard that police had identified ten victims – females aged from ten to 35. Police have been unable to trace one of the victims who was attacked at the hospital and they have been unable to establish the identities of a further 18 victims who were filmed by Hutchinson at the leisure centre. Caught: The nurse was found to be filming victims at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon . His rape victims were an 18-year-old woman attacked in October 2011 and a 35-year-old woman abused in February 2012. Both were under general anaesthetic at the time in the A&E department. Hutchinson, who had a girlfriend, became a nurse on the A&E wing of John Radcliffe Hospital in 2006. At some point he was promoted to the rank of senior nurse which meant he was trusted to treat patients on his own - he will be sentenced next month. Theft: The nurse stole this Nasopharyngoscope - used for inernal examinations - and used it to film up a woman's skirt as she visited a friend in hospital . Mark Power, Director of Workforce at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'The ultimate responsibility for these appalling offences must rest with Andrew Hutchinson. Our staff have been devastated by his actions and his betrayal of their trust. It is not possible to eliminate the risk of a rogue practitioner entirely. 'This does not absolve anybody from learning lessons from these terrible events and we have taken steps to eliminate the possibility of this happening again. Our emergency department is now busier than ever and patients who are unconscious are treated in one area of the department with open visibility. At the time of the offences, this group of patients were more spread out within the department.' It emerged today that it is not the first rape scandal on its A&E ward. Nurse Oliver Balicao raped a teenager in a side room after she had been rushed to hospital after an overdose in 2004. Her mother and the girl’s boyfriend did not believe her because she was hallucinating but years later she came forward and he was convicted in 2010. Balicao had even used a condom to hide DNA evidence in the premeditated attack. He was also found guilty of a sexual assault on a 22-year-old PHD student who was attacked in her hospital bed. Balicao was previously jailed in 2007 for 16 months for having sex with a 16-year-old patient in a disabled toilet at the hospital after she had overdosed on paracetamol. The girl had accused him of raping her when luring her in saying she needed to do a urine test - but a jury cleared him of rape and accepted a guilty plea of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.","Andrew Hutchinson raped two women under general anaesthetic in Oxford .

"President Barack Obama brought his two daughters to Selma to 'remind them of their obligations', it has been revealed, as thousands of people are commemorating 'Bloody Sunday' for a second day. The 53-year-old president and his family paid tribute to civil rights legends sung and unsung by leading a symbolic march across the Alabama town's Edmund Pettus Bridge on Saturday afternoon. Speaking on the bridge in the sunshine, Obama said of his 13-year-old and 16-year-old daughter: 'I want to say what an extraordinary honor this has been, especially to have Sasha and Malia here.' He had previously said he hoped the girls - who wore  dresses and boots for the 50th anniversary march - would be reminded 'of their own obligations' to continue America's fight for civil rights. 'There are going to be marches for them to march, and struggles for them to fight. And if we've done our job, then that next generation is going to be picking up the torch, as well,' he said last month. Scroll down for video .

Earlier this week, in a radio interview with host Tom Joyner, Obama added: 'Part of what I want Malia and Sasha to understand is that this is an unfinished project,' referring to simmering racial tensions that flared up following the police killings of black men in Missouri and New York last year. Today, people from across the world were  marching over the historic bridge - where police and state troopers beat and used tear gas against more than 600 protesters in 1965 - for a second day. Among them was Mercedes Binns, who lives out of state and has visited Selma a total of 17 times because of its civil rights history. She was seen punching the air with determination as she walked.

"Virginia's governor is asking for an investigation into how a college student ended up bloodied during an arrest outside of a bar early Wednesday morning. Martese Johnson, a junior at University of Virginia, was arrested on charges of obstruction of justice without force, and public swearing or intoxication after being denied entry to a campus-area bar. Governor Terry McAuliffe's office released a statement Wednesday that called for state police to examine 'the use of force' by liquor control officers. In a video obtained by student newspaper The Cavalier Daily, a bystander shouts that Johnson's head is bleeding and Johnson is heard yelling: 'I go to UVA. You f******* racists. ... How did this happen?' A group called Concerned Black Students circulated a statement saying that Johnson did not resist during questioning or his arrest outside of Trinity Irish Pub and received 10 stitches in his head after the arrest. McAuliffe said he is 'concerned by the reports of this incident' at UVA - which is one of the most prestigious public universities in the country. Scroll down for video . Seeing red: A photo taken of the arrest shows Martese Johnson being held down by police with blood on his face . Martese Johnson is an honor student at the prestigious university. He was left with 10 stitches following the altercation with police . Johnson's attorney Daniel Watkins said in a statement ABC officers forced Johnson to the ground, 'striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head.' 'The uniformed ABC Agents observed and approached the individual after he was refused entry to a licensed establishment,' Virginia ABC stated in a press release. 'A determination was made by the agents to further detain the individual based on their observations and further questioning.' Johnson serves on the Honor Committee at University of Virginia, is a member of the historically black Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and serves as leadership development chair of the UVA Black Student Alliance. Though he's a college junior, Johnson is under the legal drinking age. According to Charlottesville General District Court records, Johnson was charged with obstruction of justice without force, and public swearing or intoxication. He was treated at the hospital before being released. Busted up: Johnson is shown in his booking photo with blood coming from his forehead, which required 10 stitches to close, according to a statement from Concerned Black Students . Honor Committee: Johnson is an elected member of the Honor Committee at UVA as well as leadership development chair of the UVA Black Student Alliance . Knocked down: A video shows at least three officers kneeling over Johnson while he's pinned to the ground, and bleeding from a gash on his head . The ABC told the Associated Press that the agents involved have been placed in on desk duty for the remainder of the state police investigation. This isn't the first time that ABC agents working in Charlottesville, where UVA's campus is located, have been called out for overreach. In 2014, a UVA student was awarded a $212,500 settlement by the state after officers confused her groceries for beer. Elizabeth Daly panicked outside of a supermarket in 2013 when plainclothes ABC agents tried to break her windows, mistaking a carton of sparkling water for beer. The arrest proved to be a black eye for the agency and led to a public backlash, though the charges were later dropped.","Governor Terry McAuliffe's office asked for state police to conduct a probe .

"A father-of-two claims he spent the night in a hospital storage room with a brass bell to call for help and his drip dangling from a light fighting. With no other beds available Paul Ross-Bowker slept surrounded by oxygen cannisters and medical supplies, just three days after surgeons removed his appendix. His mother said the conditions were so bad, she 'half expected to see Florence Nightingale'. But while expressing her shock at her son's situation, Ms Ross-Bowker said she cannot fault the staff who cared for him. Mr Ross-Bowker was taken to Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor on Monday after complaining of pain in his abdomen. Paul Ross-Bowker claims he was moved to a hospital 'storage room'. His mother Pauline, said while she was shocked at her son's situation she cannot fault the care he received from staff at the hospital . This picture shows how Mr Ross-Bowker's drip was attached to a light fitting. A spokesman for the said it was a treatment room where clinical procedures were regularly carried out . That night, the 35-year-old had an operation to have his appendix removed, before he was taken back to his bed on one of the hospital wards. His mother Pauline said her son was still in excruciating pain the next day, and doctors subsequently discovered his wound was infected. They prescribed him the painkiller morphine, and put him on an antibiotic drip to try and combat the infection. In the early hours of Thursday morning staff woke Mr Ross-Bowker and told him he needed to be moved because his bed was needed. But instead of moving the IT worker from Brynsiencyn on Anglesey to another ward, he was taken to a side room. Staff told him it was a 'treatment, assessment, storage room'. A spokesman for the health trust which runs the hospital said the room was a treatment room where clinical procedures are routinely carried out. But not being a part of the general ward, there was no alarm system to call staff so Mr Ross-Bowker was instead given a brass bell to call nurses if he needed to. There were oxygen cannisters on the floor, as well as boxes of medical supplies. And his family said his drip was hung from the ceiling via a light fitting, preventing the 35-year-old from going to the toilet. His mother said while being shocked by her son's situation, she cannot fault the staff who cared for him. She said: 'It was a converted store cupboard which they have shoved an old bed into. The 35-year-old had his appendix removed at Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor, north Wales, on Monday. But in the early hours of Thursday morning he was moved to the side room. He said he was given a brass bell and was surrounded by oxygen cannisters and other medical supplies . 'How clean would this room have been? Certainly not as clean as the wards. He had just had surgery and had an infected wound. 'He was given a brass bell and the drip was attached to the light fitting, it was like going back to the dark ages. I half expected to see Florence Nightingale walking down the corridor.' She added: 'The doctor came to him the next morning and asked him if he wanted to stay or go home. 'Paul said if he had to spend another night in there he would rather go home, despite being in the same amount of pain he was in before his operation. The doctor said he didn't blame him. 'The situation is ridiculous, they haven't got enough beds and are closing wards and hospitals.' Ms Ross-Bowker contacted Ynys Môn Welsh Assembly Member Rhun ap Iorwerth about her son's experience. He said: 'I was shocked to hear of the conditions that one of my constituents had to endure at Gwynedd Hospital this week. 'Surely this can't be right in the 21st century? Especially considering a person is at his or her weakest at hospital, expecting them to use a brass bell to call for help is incredible. 'My constituent was full of praise for the nurses working on the ward, but they are obviously being made to work in difficult conditions with a clear lack of resources, and I will be raising this with the health board as well as the Welsh government at the first opportunity.' Professor Matthew Makin, Executive Medical Director at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said: 'Firstly we would like to apologise to the patient for any distress caused. 'As part of the Health Board’s Escalation Policy, when we’re under significant pressure and unable to off load patients from ambulances, we increase ward capacity in a safe manner, ensuring patient dignity at all times. 'The patient was nursed in an appropriate clinical area on the ward, in this instance a treatment room. 'This practice is only done in extreme circumstances and is closely monitored to ensure patient safety at all times. 'We would like to reassure the public that these instances are temporary and patients are allocated to bed spaces on wards as soon as they become available.'","Paul Ross-Bowker was taken to Gwynedd Hospital with stomach pains .

"A group of 47 Republican senators warned Iran's mullahs on Monday that any agreement the Obama administration strikes with the Islamic republic to limit Tehran's nuclear program may be short-lived unless Congress formally approves it. In a rare open letter to Iranian leaders, Arkansas freshman Sen. Tom Cotton and 46 others from the GOP wrote that without congressional approval, 'we will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei.' 'The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen,' the Republicans wrote, 'and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.' The White House in turn tried to brand Republicans as warmongers and accused them of pursuing a 'partisan strategy to undermine the president' while demanding power that goes against the role the Founding Fathers envisioned the legislative branch playing in foreign affairs. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE LETTER . Freshman Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, shown in January at the US Capitol, organized 47 Republican senators to warn Iran that a nuclear agreement could be short-lived unless Congress approves it . The White House in turn tried to brand Republicans as warmongers and accused them of pursuing a 'partisan strategy to undermine the president' while demanding authority that goes against the role the Founding Fathers envisioned the legislative branch playing in foreign affairs . Secretary of State John Kerry (third from left) met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (third from right) for a new round of nuclear negotiations last wek while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington telling Congress that Tehran can't be trusted . 'The rush to war, or at least the to the military option that many Republicans are advocating is not at all in the best interest of the United States,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday afternoon. Earnest speculated that letter emanated from Senate Republicans' concern that as soon as a deal is signed, the White House would begin pressuring Congress to begin lifting sanctions. The White House would first want to see 'demonstrated compliance' on the part of Iran before that would ever happen, the president's spokesman said. 'The president does not envision substantial sanctions relief for Iran right at the negotiating table.' It will not even be weeks or months before such a conversation would take place, he explained. 'I'm talking about years.' The single-page letter at no point makes reference to sanctions - or war, for that matter. Republicans and Democrats alike have said they would like to see a stricter sanctions regime enforced if Iran does not agree to the United States' terms by the end of the month, and a resolution to that effect is set to come to the floor of the Senate. That legislation would not authorize the president to go to war with Iran, though . Still, Earnest contended that letter signers have no alternative to President Barack Obama's diplomatic strategy other than 'a military option.' 'If they want to mask it as part of some sort of civics lesson that they want to share with Iran's political leadership, they're welcome to do that,' he said. 'It might evince some reluctance or at least hesitations about the wisdom of their strategy, or at least the wisdom of their ultimate goal here,' he charged. He added: 'The efforts of neoconservatives in the previous administration to do that frankly hurt the country's standing around the world.' Speaking to reporters after a meeting in the Oval Office with European Council President Donald Tusk, Obama commented that it's 'somewhat ironic' that Republicans want to align themselves with 'hardliners' in Iran. 'It's an unusual coalition,' he said. ON NOTICE: The letter to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (pictured) warns that senators who signed it will be in office long after President Barack Obama leaves the White House . Later in the briefing he brought up an Authorization for the Use of Military Force agreement the White House sent to Congress last month asking for the power to fight ISIS with ground troops in special circumstances. Some Republicans complained that the legislative language would bind the president too tightly because it strictly prohibited an 'enduring' deployment of US forces. 'We see a Republican Party that is eager to.... direct almost unlimited authority to the President of the United States to wage war, but to try to repeatedly tie his hands when he is trying to conduct diplomacy,' Earnest claimed. The President would rather use America's influence to try to build coalitions around the world, not only because he thinks it is 'more effective,' Earnest said, but because it 'has yielded important results for the American people.' He cited the global coalition to destroy ISIS as an example. 'There is a starkly different approach between the one that is advocated by Republicans that puts the military option and war-fighting at the top of the list,' he continued. 'That is not an approach that the vast majority of the American public support, and it's certainly not an approach that our recent history indicates is the best way to protect American national security interests.' The U.S. and other nations are seeking a pact that would let Western powers verify that Iran will not obtain a nuclear weapon. Although the letter, first reported by Bloomberg, is addressed to 'Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran,' it's equally aimed at delivering a message to Obama. 'The president may serve only two 4-year terms, whereas senators may serve an unlimited number of 6-year terms,' Cotton's group wrote. 'As applied today, for instance, President Obama will leave office in January 2017, while most of us will remain in office well beyond then – perhaps decades.' Cotton told Bloomberg that 'Iran's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal that … any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril.' California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Monday after that she was 'appalled' at the Republican effort to 'blow up a major effort by our country and the world powers to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear program.' 'This is a highly inappropriate and unprecedented incursion into the president’s prerogative to conduct foreign affairs,' she said. 'This letter only serves one purpose—to destroy an ongoing negotiation to reach a diplomatic agreement in its closing days.' The White House said Monday that the Republican senators's move 'certainly interferes' with ongoing negotiations. Their effort to 'essentially throw sand in the gears here is not helpful,' Earnest said, and is not 'the role our Founding Fathers envisioned Congress for to play when it comes to foreign affairs.' He told reporters the letter raises 'legitimate' questions about the 'intent' of Republican lawmakers. In remarks on the Senate floor Monday afternoon top-ranking Democrat Harry Reid said the judgment of the chamber's Republicans 'seems to be clouded by their abhorrence of President Obama.' Reid, who was the Senate's majority leader until January, when Republicans rose to power, said the letter signers were 'undermining' Obama 'while empowering the Ayatollahs.' 'It is unprecedented for one political party to directly intervene in an international negotiation, with the sole goal of embarrassing the President,' he stated. 'We as leaders should do everything we can to ensure these negotiations have a chance to succeed. When it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb, we should put partisanship aside.' Reid said that most Senate Democrats disagreed with President George W. Bush’s foreign policy, but they never even 'considered' sending a letter to Saddam Hussein because 'it would have been an embarrassment.' 'Obviously Republicans don’t know how to do anything other than attempt these seemingly juvenile political attacks against the President,' he said, attacking his successor, Mitch McConnell's ability to govern. The uranium enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran is a major sticking point with the US, which wants inspectors to have unfettered access to the Iranian regime's nuclear program . 'The greatest threat against the world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons,' Israeli Priime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Congress last Tuesday . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint meeting of Congress last week in Washington. 'The greatest threat against the world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons,' he warned lawmakers. Republicans and some Democrats want Congress to have a vote on any agreement. The pact the bargainers are working on does not actually require congressional approval, however, because it is not a treaty, which would require a two-thirds majority Senate vote to be ratified. Last week Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, postponed action on legislation that would give Congress a vote on any deal that emerges. He delayed the measure in the face of solid Democratic opposition to moving ahead on the bill now, just weeks before an end-of-March deadline for negotiators to produce an outline of an agreement. On CBS' 'Face the Nation' Sunday, McConnell said the president would need congressional approval to lift sanctions already imposed on Tehran because of its nuclear program. 'I think he cannot work around Congress forever,' McConnell said. Obama said in a separate CBS interview that the U.S. would 'walk away' from the talks unless they produce a procedure for verifying that restrictions on Iran's nuclear effort are working.

"Despite the rather clunky acronym, Mitsubishi's Outlander PHEV has been a runaway success on the quiet. Though not cheap, at up to £40,000, they're selling like hot cakes — largely as a company car because of the massive tax advantages. Now there's good news for those whose budgets can't stretch to one, because there's to be a smaller, mid-size sibling. The prototype XR-PHEV (Plug-in Electric Vehicle) II is a compact, lightweight SUV powered by a new hybrid electric system. Clearly aimed at top-selling Nissan Qashqai country, expect prices either side of £20,000 when the production model hits the market in a couple of years' time. Mitsubishi's XR-PHEV (Plug-in Electric Vehicle) II (pictured) will cost up to £40,000 (prototype pictured) Mitsubishi says of its baby PHEV: 'The system is estimated to achieve very low CO2 emissions of below 40g/km while also delivering gutsy and smooth performance with its 163bhp electric motor.' It adds that it is developing plug-in electric hybrid systems best suited to each model in its line-up with a view to introducing them in the near future. The Outlander PHEV can be charged overnight at home, run on electric-only power or operate in hybrid mode, switching automatically between petrol and electric power, depending on which is most efficient. It continues to charge itself as it runs on fossil fuel. The result is great fuel economy and low CO2 emissions. But its real benefit — and one secret of its success — is on the tax front. It would be Chancellor George Osborne's worst nightmare if everybody had one, as his tax take would plummet. Here's why: bought outright privately, the Outlander PHEV costs £28,249 to £39,999, which includes a taxpayer subsidy of £5,000. But company car drivers can look forward to an increase in their pay packet equal to an average of more than £4,000 every year, says Mitsubishi. Its twolitre petrol engine linked to two high-efficiency electric motors gives a combined range of 510 miles, of which 32.5 miles can be in pure electric mode. Average CO2 emissions are a tiny 44g/km and combined fuel efficiency is 148 mpg. But here's the rub, get one as a company car and you pay just 5 per cent 'benefit in kind' tax, compared to the 25 per cent that most business users pay. So, for example, a 40 per cent taxpayer with an Outlander PHEV GX4h with a P11D taxable benefits value of £37,899 will pay just £758 in company car tax. That compares to £4,301 for a Honda CRV EC 2.2 i-DTEC auto costing £33,605, which is taxed at 32 per cent of its P11D value. That's equivalent to a tax saving of £3,543 over a year or £10,730 over three. The new prototype's big brother is the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV (pictured) Plus, its low CO2 emissions mean you are exempt from road tax — and in London, the congestion charge, too. There's a benefit for firms, too, notes Mitsubishi: 'A company purchasing an Outlander PHEV is able to write down 100 per cent of the cost of the car against its profits chargeable for corporation tax in year one. 'This is compared to a traditional company vehicle where a maximum of 18 per cent per annum of the cost is allowable to write down against the profits chargeable for corporation tax. 'This means any business with even a small fleet could save tens of thousands of pounds in corporation tax in the first year.' Less than a year on from its UK launch last April, Mitsubishi has sold more than 10,000 Outlander PHEVs. It's overtaken every other plug-in hybrid and pure electric car, even passing vehicles that have been on sale since 2011, such as the Nissan Leaf, to become the UK's favourite plug-in vehicle, says Mitsubishi. Its UK managing director Lance Bradley adds: 'This is a satisfying achievement, but more significantly indicates this newly developing market is beginning to decide which electric vehicle technology delivers the right balance of low emissions, value, economy and practicality.' Seat's 20V20 crossover concept car is pictured at the 85th International Motor Show in Geneva 2015 . Seat has also jumped on to the growing sports utility bandwagon with a sporty off-roader shown at Geneva. The company, part of German giant Volkswagen Group, is understood to be planning three crossover or SUV-style vehicles — with at least one gunning for Nissan's Qashqai — dubbed the cash cow for the profits it's earned for Nissan. Seat's chief executive Juergen Stackmann said: 'This is the first step in a family of SUVs. The car is a lighthouse for our brand.'

"The foreign spy arrested on suspicion of helping three British schoolgirls travel to Syria to join the Islamic State was working for the Canadian intelligence service, it has been reported. Turkish foreign minister Mehmet Cavusoglu earlier said the suspect works for the intelligence agency of a country that is part of the US-led coalition fighting ISIS but did not identify the country, saying only that it was not the United States or a member of the European Union. However, an Istanbul-based newspaper has reported that the spy was working for the Canadian government. Scroll down for video . A man has been arrested for allegedly helping three British schoolgirls - Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 (above) - cross into Syria to become Jihadi brides for Islamic State militants . The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes . Dailysabah.com cited 'sources close to the government' as the basis of the assertion. Mr Cavusoglu, who was interviewed on Turkish channel A Haber TV, said he had shared the information with his British counterpart - Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, are thought to have reached the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK to join a friend last month. Britain's Foreign Office had no immediate comment and a spokesman for the Metropolitan police said he had no information. It emerged earlier this week that the three girls had paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. Police discovered they paid the £1,000 cost of their flights from Gatwick airport to Istanbul in cash. Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with 20-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow for Syria last year. The former medical student has become the online contact of choice for those wanting to travel to Syria and marry a militant fighter. One of the girls, Shamima Begum, used her Twitter account to try to contact her directly, asking for her to open a private line of communication. Friends suspect the girls were in touch with Mahmood and Islamic State recruiters via their mobile phones in the weeks before Christmas. The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes. On the run: (l to r) Amira Abase, Shamima Begum and Kadiza Sultana paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. They are understood to be in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa . They were later seen on CCTV in Turkey, dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with Syria. They are now believed to be in Raqqa, Islamic State’s stronghold and scene of some of its most barbaric atrocities. It is thought they were staying with a British girl – believed to be a pupil from their school who went missing in December and is believed to have joined ISIS. Sought advice: Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with Aqsa Mahmood (pictured), a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow for Syria last year . The 15-year-old student, the first to disappear from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, has not been identified by the authorities. Mark Rowley, who has overall responsibility for police counter terrorism, said the three girls would not be arrested for terrorist offences if they returned to the UK. ‘We have no evidence in this case that any of the three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences,’ he said. Over the weekend it also emerged that letters from Scotland Yard to the girls' families – explaining that the pupils would be part of the inquiry into their friend's disappearance – had been given to the schoolgirls rather than their parents. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted that ‘with the benefit of hindsight’ officers should have communicated directly with the families. But he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology. However, the families refused to accept any responsibility for the teenagers' actions when they appeared before a committee of MPs earlier this week. Instead, they spent spent more than an hour castigating police over what they claimed was a failure to inform of their children's potential radicalisation. They were led by their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, once the representative of a close associate of the Woolwich killers, who repeatedly demanded an apology. He accused Scotland Yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in February and their close friend in December. Extreme beliefs: The Al-Khansa Brigade (pictured with automatic weapons) in Raqqa has said children as young as nine should be encouraged to marry and it is women's duty to obey men - who are their masters . Evidence: Khadiza's cousin Fahmida Aziz (left), Shamima's sister Sahima Begum (centre) and Amira's father Hussen Abase (right), appeared before the House of Commons home affairs committee earlier this week . The country's top police officer was later forced to apologise to the families over a misplaced letter relating to the fourth girl's disappearance. However, senior figures, led by David Cameron, insisted parents must take responsibility and play their part in stopping the spread of militant beliefs. 'Everyone has a role to play,' said the Prime Minister. Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond echoed the comments saying: 'Parents have responsibilities, schools and community workers have responsibilities as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators.' At least 22 young women, the vast majority under the age of 20, are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months. Police said the total confirmed number of people travelling to fight is now around 700, with many more suspected of flying out undetected. Islamic State seized large swathes of land last June, including territory close to the Turkish border. The U.S.-led coalition is using mostly air power in an attempt to push the Sunni militant group back.","British schoolgirls fled the UK last month to become jihadi brides in Syria .

"Four-year-old Austen Harrison, from Crawley, West Sussex was shopping when when the mirror toppled on to him, causing 'devastating' injuries . The death of a four-year old who was crushed by a mirror in a Hugo Boss store was an 'accident waiting to happen', a coroner has said. Austen Harrison from Crawley, West Sussex was shopping with his parents Simon and Irina Harrison when he was injured at the Bicester outlet village in Oxfordshire. The youngster had been playing with a heavy steel-framed fitting-room mirror while his father tried on a suit at a Hugo Boss shop when it toppled on to him, causing 'devastating' head injuries, Oxford Coroner's Court heard . Senior Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter's comments came after an inquest jury returned a narrative verdict in to the death of Austen Harrison. The jury found: 'The mirror came to fall on Austen after he moved the wings, causing the unfixed mirror to become unstable. 'The jury believes that the mirror should have been fixed to the wall and that the wall should have been reinforced. We do not believe the mirror was fixed to the wall.' The youngster underwent an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain but died four days later in hospital after life-support was switched off. The jurors, who had been listening to evidence at the Oxford hearing for three days, said safety checks should have been carried out. They stated: 'We believe there were health and safety systems in place but are not confident that these systems would have avoided any danger posed by the mirror. In any case, these systems do not seem to have been followed.' The coroner said he is writing a report about the case to the Chief Coroner in the hope of preventing future incidents. Mr Salter said: 'It is surprising to me that the mirror stayed in its position for possibly up to six months with staff and customers moving its wings. Sadly, this was an accident waiting to happen and sadly it happened to young Austen. 'You would not expect such a heavy mirror to be free-standing and unsupported in any way.' The inquest heard that the 6ft 6in (2m) high mirror, which weighed 19 stone (120kg), was not fixed to the wall and that its free-standing position on the floor meant it could easily overbalance. The fatal mirror: The inquest heard that the 6ft 6in (2m) high mirror, which weighed 19 stone (120kg), was not fixed to the wall and that its free-standing position on the floor meant it could easily overbalance . Austen had been playing with the mirror's large wing panels, which were attached by hinges, and as Mr Harrison turned away he heard a huge bang. Doctors at the John Radcliffe Hospital told the family that Austen would not recover from the 'irreversible' damage. Life support was switched off and he died on June 8 at 5.45am. The youngster had been playing with a heavy steel-framed fitting-room mirror while his father tried on a suit at a Hugo Boss shop (pictured) when it fell on him . Doctors at the John Radcliffe Hospital told the family that Austen would not recover from the 'irreversible' damage. The youngster underwent an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain . Evidence from health and safety experts suggested the mirror would have been 'very unstable' as it stood on the floor, that there was 'no form of free-standing support', and that opening the wings of the mirror would change the centre of gravity, causing it to fall forwards. The coroner said health and safety systems had been 'in place but were not followed' and that this lack of understanding and responsibility was something that 'seems to be accepted' by Hugo Boss. He also noted that the company had made efforts to improve, including hiring a health and safety manager and training for staff. Simon Harrison (left) spoke briefly with his lawyer before leaving by a back door, without further comment about the death of his only child. Pictured (right) is a closed sign following the incident . After the verdict, Mr Harrison spoke briefly with his lawyer before leaving by a back door, without further comment about the death of his only child. In a statement Hugo Boss later said: 'The global Hugo Boss team has expressed its heartfelt condolences to the family, and our thoughts are of course still with them. 'Our team remains extremely saddened by the incident. Given the ongoing investigations, it would be inappropriate to comment further.'","Austen Harrison was playing with heavy fitting-room mirror in Bicester .

"It is the supermodel look that many people aspire too, but it seems our early ancestors may have naturally had waif-like hips and thin legs. Scientists examining a 1.9 million year old pelvis and femur have found that a now extinct species of early human had very different bodies to our own. The fossil is thought to belong to either Homo rudolfensis or Homo habilis, two species of human ancestor that evolved in Africa. The 1.9 million year old  femur and pelvis above are thought to belong to Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis . While scientists have long studied the different skull shapes and facial features of these species, they are now turning their attention to their bodies. According to research led by anthropologists at the University of Missouri, these early Homo species far thinner narrow pelvises and thigh bones compared to our own species, Homo sapien and another extinct human species Homo erectus. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's . 2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing . 2.8 million years ago - The first members of the Homo family appeared in Africa as shown by the LD 350-1 fossil discovered in Ethiopia . 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis is first thought to have appeared in Africa . 1.8 million years ago - Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record . 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation . 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly . 400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia . 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa . 40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe . Their hip joints, however, were very similar to modern humans - unlike in chimpanzees where the hip is much flatter and higher than in humans. This would have given these early humans an upright posture but with narrow hips and spindly legs. Professor Carol Ward, a pathologist at the University of Missouri's school of medicine who studied the remains, said: 'What these new fossils are telling us is that the early species of our genus, Homo, were more distinctive than we thought. 'They differed not only in their faces and jaws, but in the rest of their bodies too. 'The old depiction of linear evolution from ape to human with single steps in between is proving to be inaccurate. 'We are finding that evolution seemed to be experimenting with different human physical traits in different species before ending up with Homo sapiens.' The fossilised pelvis and femur fossils were found at the Koobi Fora site on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana, in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Originally a fragment of a femur was discovered at the site in 1980 but a later excavation in 2009 revealed a new femur fragment and a piece of pelvis. Scientists have now found that the femur fragments are part for the same leg and belong the the same individual as the pelvis. Scientists have dated the fossils at around 1.9 million years old. As the oldest fossils of Homo erectus to be found are 1.8 million years old, they concluded that the fossilised bones may belong to to one to two other early human species around at the time - Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. The site where the fossil femur and pelvis were found is shown above along with when they were discovered . The site where the fossil femur and pelvis were found was in Koobi Fora, within the Rift Valley of Kenya . There are almost no skeletal pieces in the fossil record for these two species so the discovery has provided scientists a rare glimpse at how they may have looked. The researchers, whose study is published in the Journal of Human Evolution, used CT scans of the fossilised pelvis and femur to compare them to those of other species of primate, early human and modern humans. They concluded that the skeletons of early human ancestors may have quite different structures to our own. Most studies on how early Homo species would have looked have focused on the skull and facial features as can be seen in the above reconstruction of Homo habilis (left) and the skull of Homo rudolfensis (right) Professor Ward said: 'This new specimen has a hip joint like all other Homo species, but it also has a thinner pelvis and thighbone compared to Homo erectus. 'This doesn’t necessarily mean that these early human ancestors moved or lived differently, but it does suggest that they were a distinct species that could have been identified not just from looking at their faces and jaws, but by seeing their body shapes as well. 'Our new fossils, along with the other new specimens reported over the past few weeks, tell us that the evolution of our genus goes back much earlier than we thought, and that many species and types of early humans coexisted for about a million years before our ancestors became the only Homo species left.'","Fossilised pelvis and femur from early human found in Rift Valley, Kenya .

"As the 21st anniversary of the slaying of a 21-year-old Florida girl approaches, detectives from the Brevard County Sheriff's Office are still searching for leads in the cold case. Amy Gellert was stabbed to death on March 20, 1994, after she surprised an intruder in her parents' home in Cocoa Beach. The masked man, who had a gun as well as a dagger, also stabbed her stepfather Robert Lehton once in the head and her mother, Charlotte, 'Bunny' Lehton, seven times in the neck. Scroll down for video . Amy Gellert was killed by an intruder at her parents' house in Cocoa Beach, Florida, on March 20, 1994 . As the 21st anniversary of her killing approaches, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office is still looking for leads . Amy's stepfather Robert Lehton (left) was stabbed once in the head and her mother, Charlotte, 'Bunny' Lehton (right), was stabbed seven times in the neck by the intruder . Amy had arrived at the house after attending church services. Before she stumbled upon the masked assailant, he had forced her parents to lay on the floor and taken money and credit cards from Bunny's wallet, CBS reported. The man was behaving calmly until he saw the lights from Amy's car and began stabbing her parents. After he was stabbed, Bob ran outside and the intruder followed him. Police say Amy was the 'catalyst' for the 1994 killing . The killer arrived at Amy's car and began stabbing her. She fled the vehicle, but only made it as far as a nearby parking lot before collapsing. Amy's parents survived their wounds, but Amy did not. She had two older brothers, Mark and Ryan. Police have never arrested any suspects in connection with the murder and do not have a concrete motive for the deadly attack. Major Tod Goodyear was one of the investigators called to the crime scene in 1994. He said: 'I have a hard time thinking this is a random act. 'The consensus tends to be that Amy's the catalyst. 'There's something there with Amy that probably caused this to happen.' The unsolved cold case was featured on an episode of 48 Hours that aired on Saturday. During the episode, images of the weapons were aired and potential suspects were identified. Based on a magazine police found at the scene, they were able to determine the suspect had a prop gun. The dagger was never found. Although it seemed real during the attack, the intruder was actually armed with a prop gun (pictured) The dagger the intruder used to stab Amy, Bunny and Bob was never recovered by the police (sketch shown) Three suspects - Jeffrey Anderson, Hugh Poppell and Dominic Kanuika - were identified during the show. Anderson was involved in a police chase the day after Amy was killed and is currently in prison. However, police could never connect him to the murder. Poppell had a romantic relationship with Amy and police received a tip he may have been involved in the murder after he died in a hit-and-run accident in 2013. Kanuika became a suspect after someone reportedly overheard his high school girlfriend saying he was 'possibly involved with that homicide'. Even though he had a shaky alibi and failed a polygraph, police could never get enough evidence to suggest Kanuika was at the house. Three suspects - Jeffrey Anderson (left), Hugh Poppell (center) and Dominic Kanuika (right) - were identified . Major Tod Goodyear (left) and the rest of his cold case team are still hoping to catch Amy's killer 21 years later . Show producers and the Lehtons are hoping the episode will  turn up some new leads for police. During the broadcast, staff members from the program monitored Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets for tips, according to Florida Today. Show correspondent Erin Moriarty said: 'It's not only unsolved but it's really difficult to - even to this day after speaking with all the detectives who worked on this case  - determine the motive. 'And that really is the reason why they have not been able to completely tie up all the strings and arrest someone. 'One person's life was taken but so many other lives along the way were destroyed.'

"An audacious raid on two armoured trucks on a busy motorway was last night being linked to a notorious gang known as the Pink Panthers. Jewels worth at least £7million were stolen by armed robbers who struck yesterday at a toll booth on the route linking Paris to the South of France. The daring raid took place just after midnight as the security trucks approached the toll at Avallon in Burgundy, 125 miles south-east of Paris on the A6. Burnt-out vehicles are seen after a group of battle-hardened armed thieves attacked two heavily guarded vans carrying jewels . Authorities are combing the Yonne region in Burgundy southeast of Paris and surrounding areas for the attackers (file picture) The robbery took place on the A6 highway connecting Paris and Lyon . The A6 is a major route connecting the north and south of the country . As they slowed for the barrier, four cars forced them to a halt and up to 15 robbers appeared wearing balaclavas and brandishing automatic weapons. They used gas sprays to knock out the two armed guards in each lorry. The guards were pulled from their cabs and dumped by the toll booth. Yesterday's raid bore all the hallmarks of having been carried out by the Pink Panthers, a gang responsible for audacious heists across Europe and beyond over the past two decades. They always wear balaclavas or face masks and use Kalashnikovs and high-powered stolen cars to carry out their spectacular crimes. The Pink Panthers are said to speak several languages and travel on genuine passports issued to other people, but with the photos changed. Many are former soldiers from Eastern Europe. France is their favoured operating ground but they have carried out more than 100 heists across the globe, netting £300million. Cities where they have struck include London, Dubai, Geneva, Monte Carlo and Tokyo. In 2008 a court in Chambery, south-eastern France, found three Serb members of the Pink Panthers guilty of carrying out robberies in Biarritz, Cannes, Courchevel and Saint-Tropez. No shots were fired and the robbers drove off in the security trucks, which belonged to a Paris company and were full of jewels and other valuables. Other gang members escaped in the cars. Prosecutors said much of the raid would have been caught on CCTV. The trucks were found burned out – and empty – four hours later, 20 miles north in a wood in the village of Quenne, just off the A6 near Auxerre. A mechanical digger was discovered with its arm inside one truck, suggesting that the safes on board were transferred to the get-away cars. There were reports that the cars were spotted speeding towards Paris. Police helicopters and other units were scrambled to hunt the gang but by dawn there was no sign. The security guards are being held for questioning. The A6, known as the ‘Motorway of the Sun’ is hugely popular with holidaymakers, and is used by hundreds of thousands of British drivers every year. The methods used in the robbery immediately led to speculation that the Pink Panthers – a notorious gang of criminals from Eastern Europe – had struck again. The gang earned their name in 1993 after stealing a £500,000 diamond from a jewellers in Mayfair, London, and hiding it in a jar of face cream – a tactic copied from the 1963 film The Pink Panther, starring Peter Sellers as the bungling Inspector Clouseau. The film’s title refers to the name of the missing diamond, although a cartoon pink panther appears in the opening and closing credits. The police official says no one was injured in the attack early Wednesday, and the drivers of the two vans were left at the scene unharmed (file picture)","Authorities combing the Yonne region in Burgundy   for the attackers .

Caroline, pictured outside the prestigious British University, said: 'I love Cambridge so much, in the evangelical way only an immigrant can' and she wants to share her journey with everyone . Thanks to her cult following, the brunette student is now writing a book going behind the scenes at Britain's most prestigious university. Thrusting herself into university life, Caroline has enjoyed a succession of May Balls, formal dinners, and weekend escapades to rival university Oxford. She has even dined in the famous private members-only 'Pitt Club', which  the likes of HRH Prince Albert Victor and actor Eddie Redmayne have been members. Speaking about her University experience, she said: 'I love Cambridge so much, in the evangelical way only an immigrant can. 'In the States we don't have castles - it's literally like if one part of one old building in Cambridge was transplanted to America it would be our greatest national treasure.

'I just love everything here, it's so different and alien to everything I grew up on, I want to share it with everyone. 'The rules are so funny and bizarre and it's just incredible to imagine the history that people have been studying here for hundreds and hundreds of years. 'I feel like I'm in Harry Potter, turning up for dinner in the grand hall in my robes and having beautiful three course meals. I'm still getting used to which way to lean when they serve you. 'I can't tell you the amount of times I've had to Google etiquette. Not because I necessarily want to change to be British but more because I don't want to horribly embarrass myself or be rude to the host. 'It's been a steep learning curve but so much fun. The British just have so many forks but I love all the history.' After leaving Phillips Exeter Academy boarding school in New Hampshire five years ago, Caroline, seen 'revising' on the lawn, became a full-time New York blogger before deciding to further her studies in the UK .

A mature student, 23-year-old Caroline is currently undergoing her second year at St Edmund's College studying history of art. After leaving Phillips Exeter Academy boarding school in New Hampshire five years ago, she became a full-time New York blogger before deciding to further her studies in the UK last year. Now, when she isn't attending tutorials and lectures, Caroline is writing her Cambridge tales alongside her pictures, in what she describes as a 'new kind of memoir'. The student blogs about her life with friends on campus and documents twee weekends spent with them in the country. Caroline gives readers a glimpse into the life of students behind the exclusive college walls - drinking on the college lawns, revising on the 'backs of Kings', attending garden parties and dancing at May Balls.

Caroline, pictured punting with friend Robin Mackworth-Young, loves the British accent and says even when she can't understand what's going on around her, there's nowhere else she'd rather be . And she marvels at events like Trinity College's 'Court Run' in the Autumn, a race where students down copious amounts of port before attempting to run around the square before the grand clock strikes twelve. At times baffled by quirky Brits, Caroline admits there are elements of our aristocratic traditions that wouldn't wash in all-American New York City. She said: 'The Brits are so different from the Americans - I'm sure they think I'm crazy but unlike New Yorkers they are too polite to tell you. 'American college students like to drink shots at Frat parties but here they like to drink three types of wine at dinner. 'I got my room by chance but in the States they would find the fact that sometimes they assign rooms on test scores baffling - the idea that you get a better room based on grade just wouldn't happen in New York. 'Only certain people of a certain status can walk on the lawns - I think if I didn't write my blog or take photographs, my American friends just wouldn't believe that these things happen. 'It's archaic and almost medieval sometimes. I do think it's snobby, and slightly ridiculous but in an incredibly endearing British way and I find the old traditions just mesmerising.' Caroline jokes that she came to study in England to avoid the 'math' requirement set on college applications in the States. But when she isn't attending lectures in beautiful 'castle-like buildings', Caroline makes sure her social calendar is full to the brim, and she is currently working hard to blow off steam after exams and essays for the notorious 'May Week' - a week of parties and balls after the exam period at the end of the academic year. When she isn't attending lectures in beautiful 'castle-like buildings', Caroline, seen in her dorm, makes sure her social calendar is full to the brim . Caroline spends her weekends exploring the colleges and is amused by the 'no walking on the lawns'  rules . Caroline says life at Cambridge is 'just a totally different type of glamour' adding: 'it is another world' 'May Week is such an amazing week, everyone was already talking about it when I arrived in October, so I was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype,' she said. 'But then May Week came and it was fabulous. I had to sell a kidney to pay for all the balls,' she joked, 'but it was totally worth it.' She continued: 'Tickets vary from £90 going all the way up to £250 for certain balls, which are white tie and only happen every three years. 'I don't think Americans even really know what white tie is. I certainly didn't when I first came here. It's just a totally different type of glamour, it is another world. 'America does a lot of things well: hot dogs, obesity and fun - but we don't do glamour like the Brits. 'I went to Trinity Ball last year. It is held in the most stunning setting, the girls all look beautiful and the men look like they're from a BBC period drama.' Caroline, pictured relaxing on Jesus Green, in 2014, Cambridge, says she wants to clarify that she is not one of those 'tragically old-fashioned girls who goes to college only to find a husband'and loves her degree . Caroline, seen with her friends in her Cambridge dorm, jokes that she came to study in England to avoid the 'math' requirement set on college applications in the States . Caroline is currently in the process of writing her book, a collection of funny essays and pictures about her escapades, which will be released in 2016 . Lifting the lid on working hard and playing hard, Caroline told how her and college friends have broken into garden parties and even accidentally stole a punt overnight. She added: 'Summer in Cambridge is magical. After exams, students punt to a nearby village called Grantchester where the picnics range from bucolic and stress-reducing to rowdy and Prosecco-fuelled. 'Last term, when we accidentally stole a punt, we ended up getting horribly drunk and abandoning ship. 'The next morning we got up early and hungover to return it before anybody noticed it was missing.' Caroline is currently in the process of writing her book, a collection of funny essays and pictures about her escapades, which will be released in 2016. Other anecdotes include the evening she and her boyfriend got trapped in the Palace of Versailles overnight and when she was featured in Hounds magazine because of her 'rather inappropriate hunting attire'. But her absolute favourite thing about Cambridge? The British accent. 'I definitely grew up with the Hollywood tropes of the American girl who meets the dashing Hugh Grant boy,' she gushed. 'I want to clarify that I am not one of those tragically old-fashioned girls who goes to college only to find a husband. I love my degree, period. But I'm not complaining about all the dashing British accents. 'I love that everyone sounds so proper and lovely, even when I can't understand what's going on around me - there's nowhere else I'd rather be.'","New York-born Caroline Calloway, 23, has   300,000 Instagram followers .

"Plus-size fashion is a hard market to crack but with the average UK dress size hitting 16, many women are left frustrated by designers that seemingly have little knowledge of the female form or how women want to dress. And that is exactly why Evans, who pioneered the first-ever plus-size fashion week, want to change that. The high street store, which falls under Sir Philip Green's Arcadia umbrella,  set up an initiative last year with universities to teach students how to design plus-size clothes for the brand's Cut for Evans range. Evans, which falls under Sir Philip Green's Arcadia umbrella, is giving plus-size fashion a trendy edge . Evans Head of Design, Rebecca Vann Reicher, wanted to change the way the next generation of fashion designers view plus-size. So, she asked students from Nottingham Trent and Kingston University to design a six-piece collection that was fashion forward but not limited by size. A panel of industry experts were brought together in New York to judge the competition. The panel included Whitney Thompson (America’s Next Top Model winner), Susan Moses (stylist for Amber Riley and Queen Latifah), Gary Dakin (JAG Models founder), among others. Susan Moses said of the calibre of the finalists: ‘I love the innovation and was totally inspired by the creativity and the vision that the students have for plus size women.' The high street store set up an initiative last year with universities to teach students how to design plus-size clothes for the brand's Cut for Evans range and now they stock the winner's in store . Students from Nottingham Trent and Kingston University were asked to design a six-piece collection that was fashion forward but not limited by size and Yvonne Shu Yao won with this colourful range . The overall winner Yvonne Shu Yao, a BA student at Nottingham Trent University, took inspiration for her collection from the underwater world. The result is an esoteric range that creates a silhouette aimed to fit and flatter. The SS15 collection was chosen to open the Design Collective Show during LFW and is available to buy in Evans stores and online across the UK, US and Europe now. So what do the plus-size industry think? Rivkie Baum, editor SLiNK magazine, an aspirational fashion and lifestyle for women with curves, said: 'It is great to see that Evans continue to support students breaking into fashion and, of course, continuing to encourage fashion students to think about designing for the growing plus-size fashion market. 'This new collection shown at London fashion week in September was beautiful. The prints are well placed and really calming. 'The Cut continues to be a great success because the classic and easy to wear silhouettes will never date, making these some great investment pieces.'

"Former radio host Mel Greig has revealed that she is trying for a baby and is freezing her eggs before she loses one of her ovaries. The 33-year-old DJ, who was behind the royal phone call prank in 2012 which led to the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, is suffering from endometriosis,  a condition that can cause pelvic pain and infertility. The radio personality, who is married to former footballer Steven Pollock, has opened up about her struggle as part of Endometriosis Awareness month during March. Former 2DayFM host Mel Greig, who is pictured here with her husband Steven Pollock, has revealed that she is trying for a baby and is freezing her eggs before she loses one of her ovaries . 'I had a bit of a cry when I was told I wasn't going to be able to get pregnant naturally — that was incredibly hard to hear,' Greig, who is a spokesperson from Endometriosis Australia told Adelaide Now. 'We're going to freeze my eggs and make embryos before my next surgery.' 'Hopefully, I'll be pregnant by the end of the year — that's the plan.' The couple tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Byron Bay on November 20, 2014 in front of just 36 members of their family and friends and then set off on a trip through the US. Greig is no stranger to crippling illnesses. Just before her nuptials she was hospitalised  with appendicitis. The radio personality has admitted that she would like to be pregnant by the end of the year . Greig and Pollock tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Byron Bay on November 20, 2014 in front of just 36 members of their family and friends and then set off on a trip through the US . Endometriosis can be a painful disease for sufferers. There is no known cure and it can take years to be detected. It causes lesions to grow in a woman's womb, leading to severe pain and inflammation. Greig is expected to begin hormone treatment  at the end of the month and undergo surgery to remove the legions in her abdomen. While she is hoping she will not have to have one of her ovaries removed, her doctors have told her that this is a possibility. Greig and her co-host Michael Christian were famously engulfed in a scandal in 2012 after she participated in a radio prank call to the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness. They managed to dupe nurse Jacintha Saldanha who transferred their call to another nurse who divulged private information about the Duchess' condition. Soon after the hoax was publicised, Ms Saldanha committed suicide. Both Mr Christian and Ms Greig were devastated by the nurse's death, and apologised for making the call. Nurse Jacintha Saldanha committed suicide after the prank call . A court ruling found 2DayFM were in break of their licencing laws by not obtaining the consent of those involved before broadcasting the call . Ms Greig flew herself to London to make a statement to the court and apologise to Ms Saldanha's family. ACMA sought to take action against the station for breaching a condition of its licence which stipulates that it would not use its broadcasting service in the commission of an offence. In March, Australia's High Court ruled that the radio station breached its licence by not obtaining the consent of those involved before broadcasting the call. 2DayFM could also be subjected to 'enforceable undertakings to force future compliance, or further licence conditions.' In the call, the two announcers phoned London's King Edward VII Hospital pretending to be the Queen and Prince of Wales and seeking information about the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. The High Court ruling upholds the finding, which had previously been overturned by the Federal Court, confirming the Authority does have the power to decide whether a criminal offence has been committed for the purpose of determining whether there has been a breach of the Broadcasting Services Act. Ms Greig apologised for her role in the incident at Mrs Saldanha's inquest last year, and has spoken of her horror and disgust at the part she played in the prank.

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday there would be no Palestinian state if he were reelected, in a last-ditch effort to woo right-wing voters on the eve of a general election. Polling stations opened today for Israel's second snap general election in three years in a ballot experts agree is likely to be a referendum on the Netanyahu years. With his rightwing Likud trailing the centre-left Zionist Union in the latest opinion polls, Netanyahu said that if his rivals were elected security would be compromised and they would give up total Israeli control over Jerusalem. Scroll down for video . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday there would be no Palestinian state if he were reelected. He's pictured here giving a statement to the press during his visit on Monday to Har Homa, an Israeli settlement neighbourhood in annexed east Jerusalem . Support: Norris in his YouTube video . Netanyahu received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star Chuck Norris, who said that his re-election is crucial for the safety of Israel. In a short YouTube video called Please Vote For Prime Minister Netanyahu, Norris said: 'I watched Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech before Congress, and I saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul. I also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the Israeli people. 'I have done three movies in Israel – 'Delta Force' being my favorite – and I formed many friendships while there. You have an incredible country, and we want to keep it that way. 'That's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only Israel but also the United States. You see, we the American people need Prime Minister Netanyahu as much as you do. Weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on America, too. 'So I ask you, please, for the sake of Israel and the whole Middle East, vote for Prime Minister Netanyahu on Election Day. 'And as far as those in the U.S. and the rest of the world, in this season of Easter, it's good to remember what the Hebrew Scriptures say about Israel and those who support her: 'Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: May they prosper who love you' (Psalm 122:1).' 'We will continue to build to fortify Jerusalem so its division will not be possible and it will remain united forever,' he said on a tour of Har Homa, a settlement neighbourhood of annexed east Jerusalem. Netanyahu, who is seeking a third consecutive term, vowed he would never allow the Palestinians to establish a capital in the city's eastern sector and pledged to build 'thousands' of settler homes. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as capital of their future state, and continued settlement building has incensed the international community, which sees it as an obstacle to peace. Throughout his campaign, Netanyahu has repeatedly accused Zionist Union leaders Isaac Herzog and former peace negotiator Tzipi Livni of being ready to abandon Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its indivisible capital. But Netanyahu's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing NRG website if it was true that there would be no Palestinian state established if he was reelected. 'Indeed,' said Netanyahu, who in 2009 had endorsed the idea of two states living side by side. He later told public radio the two-state solution was now irrelevant, saying the 'reality has changed' and 'any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical Islamists'. Netanyahu has based his campaign solidly on security issues, notably the Iranian nuclear threat, giving short shrift to the focus on economic issues in centre-left campaigning. 'If Tzipi and Bougie set up the next government, Hamastan 2 will be established on these hills here,' he said in Har Homa, using the nickname of his key challenger, Labour leader Herzog. 'Hamastan' is a derogatory term used by Israeli politicians to refer to the Gaza Strip, which has been ruled by Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas since 2007. Netanyahu received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star Chuck Norris, who said that his re-election is crucial for the safety of Israel. In a short YouTube video called Please Vote For Prime Minister Netanyahu, Norris said: 'I watched Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech before Congress, and I saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul. I also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the Israeli people. 'I have done three movies in Israel – Delta Force being my favorite – and I formed many friendships while there. You have an incredible country, and we want to keep it that way. Israeli Labour Party leader and co-leader of the Zionist Union coalition, Isaac Herzog, speaks with citizens as he campaigns on the eve of Israel's general election in the coastal Israeli city of Tel Aviv . 'That's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only Israel but also the United States. You see, we the American people need Prime Minister Netanyahu as much as you do. Weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on America, too.' Herzog, meanwhile, has dismissed Netanyahu's jibes. On Sunday he pledged to 'safeguard' Jerusalem 'in actions, not just words, more than any other leader', and on Monday insisted Jerusalem would remain forever Israel's 'undivided capital'. Former prime minister and Labour leader Ehud Barak came out in support of Herzog, calling him 'experienced and responsible' and someone who could be relied upon to ensure Israel's safety. The outgoing Israeli parliament and the latest opinion poll . Supporters Netanyahu,attend his campaign meeting on Monday in Rabin Square in the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv . Despite Netanyahu's vitriol, the Zionist Union is tipped to come out on top in the election. Final opinion polls published late last week put the Zionist Union ahead with 25-26 seats with Netanyahu's Likud taking 20-22 in the 120-seat Knesset. But experts have warned about their reliability of the polls, pointing to the 2013 election when they completely failed to predict the level of support for centrist newcomer Yesh Atid. 'In all previous elections we had considerable differences between the predictions of the public opinion polls and (the results),' said Professor Avraham Diskin, a political scientist from Jerusalem's Hebrew University. 'Yesh Atid didn't get more than 10 or 11 seats in the public opinion polls and finally got twice as many - 19 seats.' Israeli MP and chairperson of center-right Yesh Atid party, Yair Lapid, delivers a speech during the election campaign at the Israeli city of Modiin near Tel Aviv . The leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier -- as in 2009 when the centrist Kadima party then headed by Livni effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought Netanyahu to power for a second term. 'In 2009, (Likud) had a 100-percent chance of forming a government while the leader of the largest party, Tzipi Livni, had no chance whatsoever - and therefore she was not nominated,' Diskin said. Under Israel's complex electoral system, the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes, but to the MP or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has also made overtures to centre-right Kulanu party, seen as the kingmaker, offering the finance portfolio to its leader Moshe Kahlon who dismissed this as 'spin'. 'Whoever wants to follow (Netanyahu's) path of despair and disappointment will vote for him,' Herzog said after casting his vote. 'But whoever wants change, hope, and really a better future for Israel, will vote the Zionist Union led by me.' That call resonated with 51-year-old Ofer Benishti, who voted at a polling station in Kfar Saba in central Israel. He said he was a lifelong Likud voter but was now casting his ballot for the Zionist Union. 'I have had enough,' said Benishti, a businessman whose company deals with spare parts for buses. 'Bibi tried and tried and tried, but it just hasn't worked. It's time to give someone else a chance. It can't get worse than this.' Israeli election officials said 26.5 percent of eligible voters had voted by midday, a rate similar to previous years. Elections day is a public holiday in Israel - most people do not go to work, beaches and restaurants fill up, and stores advertise election-day sales. Facebook featured a special 'I voted' button in Hebrew, as it has during elections in other countries, in an effort to get out the vote. This election season has amplified the bitter divide between hard-liners and moderates in Israel.","Polling stations opened today for Israel's second snap general election .

"A Fashion Police insider has claimed that Kathy Griffin was about to be fired from the show before her unexpected Twitter resignation. In yet another twist to the saga, TMZ has claimed that producers had met and discussed booting her from the show. According to the report, a pitch meeting took a sour turn when somebody suggested a new segment called 'Whore Score', but Griffin shot it down for being too mean, claiming 'Name calling and alliteration with no comedic context is simply the lowest hanging fruit'. Scroll down for video . Jumped or pushed?: A Fashion Police insider has reportedly claimed Kathy Griffin was about to be fired from the show when she suddenly announced she was quitting on Twitter . She then went on a rant blasting the show as 'old school and tired' which infuriated production staff, who felt she was being hypocritical as her comedy routines have always been exactly what she was complaining about. However Griffin denied she was facing the axe, claiming the show's producers kept promising her she could host in her own comedy style but continuously reneging and forcing her to do the same old fare. The 54-year-old comedienne announced abruptly on Thursday with a lengthy Twitter message that she was abandoning the post she had filled following the death of legendary host Joan Rivers in September. Rally: The 54-year-old sent an email out to her celebrity friends asking them to support her decision publicly . 'After seven episodes of Fashion Police, I discovered that my style does not fit with the creative direction of the show and now it’s time to move on,' Kathy wrote, claiming that while she was happy to playfully tease people about their clothes, she did not want to 'contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference'. It emerged on Friday that just after she jumped ship, Griffin emailed a number of her celebrity friends asking them to take to Twitter and make a public show of supporting her decision. The email, obtained by Buzzfeed, was subjected 'Here's why I need you...' was sent to a list of undisclosed recipients. Low hanging fruit: Critics have pointed out the comedienne has never been shy about laughing at other people's physicalities . What she said: Griffin wrote a lengthy letter explaining her decision . 'I went live with the following statement on my social media platforms this evening. I’m reaching out to you because I think you will understand why I have made this decision and I am asking for your support via Twitter, etc. IF you are comfortable,' she wrote . 'I admire you & your work and hope that you can stand by me. Once again, IF you are comfortable. Oh, and I am nervous and scared about this…in case you’re wondering :wink:' before signing off Thanks! XXOO, Kathy Griffin'. A host of celebrities, including Kelly Osbourne and Lena Dunham, immediately took to Twitter to applaud her departure after just seven episodes. Second exit: Kathy is the second person to quit Fashion Police after Kelly Osbourne, who previously revealed she was leaving the series to pursue other projects . Kelly, who herself walked away from the show just days before Kathy, was among the first to commend her decision. 'I could not be more proud of you @kathygriffin you have my love and support always!' she wrote on Instagram, along with a TMI picture of the former co-hosts licking each other's tongues. Whether she as asked to or not, Lena Dunham also took to Instagram to praise Kathy's stand: 'Congrats to my beautiful friend Kathy Griffin for bravely saying enough is enough to intolerance of all kinds on television,' she wrote beneath a flashback photo of the comedienne wearing a pair of Minnie Mouse ears. 'She's modeling a better way for the youths (and working those ears).' Lip service: Kelly was among the first to praise Kathy Griffin for following her out the Fashion Police door on Thursday . Glee star Jane Lynch described Griffin as 'My brave and courageous friend,' adding: 'You're one classy dame. Onward and upward.' And Parks And Recreation's Aubrey plaza Tweeted: 'I have so much respect for Kathy Griffin. Cheers for doing what you think is right. She is my hero.' Actress Kristen Chenoweth Tweeted the star directly, saying: '@kathygriffin Gurl. I read your statement. Thanks for being WHO YOU ARE. Can't wait to work together on your chapter? You're every woman.' Fellow TV host Chelsea Handler, who walked away from her own show last year, wrote: '@kathygriffin way to go girl. Stick to your guns. Onwards and sideways. Lub you.' All ears: Lena Dunham posted a flashback shot of Griffin who 'bravely saying enough is enough to intolerance of all kinds on television' You go 'Gurl': Jane Lynch, Wendy Williams and Kristin Chenoweth immediately got behind Kathy's decision . Among Kathy's other many supporters were chat show host Wendy Williams, who posted: 'I adore YOU and all YOU do!! xox'; while actress Alexandra Wentworth told her 'You go funny lady'; and Rosie O'Donnell simply said 'Proud of U!!!' Comedian Billy Eichner saw the funny side, tweeting: 'I love Kathy and I've seen every episode of Fashion Police but somewhere Joan Rivers is cackling', before following it up with: 'THOU SHALL NEVER CROSS THE ALMIGHTY ZENDAYA AND LIVE TO TELL THE TALE! #FashionPolice.' Fellow comedienne Margaret Cho meanwhile saw it as an opportunity to throw her own hat in the ring, calling for a new version of the show called Fashion Police: Special Victims Unit. Sticking together: Fellow TV host Chelsea Handler, who left her own show last year, said she should 'stick to her guns' 'She is my hero': Aubrey Plaza of Parks And Recreation fame said she has 'so much respect' for the comedienne . Support: Rosie O'Donnell said she was proud of Kathy's decision . 'I actually make clothes @e_FashionPolice #StraightOuttaTheSweatshopAndIntoYourHeart so you should have me host x,' she joked. Not everybody was impressed with Kathy's decision, however. Mail Online Editor At Large Piers Morgan Tweeted: 'Kathy Griffin's quit Fashion Police because she doesn't like their mean humour? Ironically, one of the few times she's ever made me laugh. 'This is the same Kathy Griffin whose whole career has been predicated on b****ing about people and being mean, right? #HypocritePolice,' he added. Indeed, Washington Post style blogger Stephanie Merry pointed out that Griffin has never been opposed to cruelly making fun of celebrities' physical appearances before, compiling an extensive list of the comedienne's stand-up routines in which she makes much more pointed barbs than anything that would be uttered on Fashion Police. Seeing the funny side: Billy Eichner and Margaret Cho cracked jokes about Kathy's exit . Hyprocrite?: However Piers Morgan wasn't impressed, saying the star's career 'has been predicated on b****ing about people' Kathy's exit comes after her co-host Kelly left the celebrity couture hits and misses series following controversy stemming from Giuliana Rancic's comments about Zendaya's hair during The Oscars on February 22. The exodus leaves two open spots alongside Giuliana and Brad Goreski on Fashion Police. Several names were suggested when Kelly announced her departure, but there have been no confirmations as of yet. Those named include reality star Khloe Kardashian, Real Housewives Of Atlanta star NeNe Leakes, Glee actress/singer Naya Rivera, model Chrissy Teigen, and hip-hop model Amber Rose. Anyone else? The exodus leaves just Giuliana Rancic, whose comment started the whole furor, and Brad Goreski as hosts .

"Even the more well-travelled among us would struggle to scratch the surface of Unesco's World Heritage List. Jaw-dropping scenery, ancient monuments and incredible wildlife are just a few of the 1007 sites earmarked for preservation by the organisation. But while well-known destinations such as Machu Picchu and the Acropolis in Athens may feature prominently on many intrepid explorers' 'to do' list, there are a number of stunning sites that the majority of us will simply never get to see. Here, we highlight a number of Unesco World Heritage sites that due to conflict, or deterioration, risk being lost to us forever - as well as a few destinations that you may be able to see for yourself... but only if you're quick. Scroll down for video . The UNESCO World Heritage sites you may never get to see: . Afghanistan - Minaret of Jam . The glorious Minaret of Jam has was built in the 12th century by Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din and marks the ancient city of Firuzkuh . The Minaret - in the Ghor province in Afghanistan - is covered in intricate brickwork and blue tiles arranged in Kufic inscription . It has survived countless wars and pillaging  the but Minaret of Jam - situated in a remote spot in the Ghor province of Afghanistan - is facing its biggest challenge yet. Extensive restoration work is needed to preserve the ancient structure, which is at risk from erosion from a nearby riverbed as well as a compromising tilt, similar to the tower at Pisa. The 65 meter needle was built in 1194 by Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din, and is covered in intricate geometric brickwork as well as Kufic inscription in dazzling blue tiles - yet most people will never get to see the Minaret. Not only is the monument miles away from the nearest human settlement, it lies in a dangerous Taliban stronghold making travel to the region virtually impossible. North-West Iraq - Samarra Archaeological City . The Great Mosque and spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city, 80 per cent of which has yet to be excavated . The archaelogical city at Samarra in Northern Iraq marks the site of a powerful Islamic capital city that ruled the region for much of the 9th century. The Great Mosque and soaring spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city, 80 per cent of which have yet to be excavated. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, this rich cultural landscape is out of bounds. The city is located in the North-West of Iraq which remains in the grip of a bitter and ongoing conflict between local militia, Isis and Kurdish forces. When, and indeed if, the remaining site will be excavated is doubtful. Ancient city of Aleppo - Syria . The city of Aleppo was named the 'Islamic Capital of Culture 2006', although you won't find any tourists there today . The Grand Mosque in the ancient city of Aleppo is at risk due to the ongoing civil war that blights the country . Syria's rich and glorious cultural heritage is demonstrated by the sheer volume of ancient monuments and historic sites that punctuate this embattled landscape. The ancient city of Aleppo contains elaborate mosques, palaces and evidence of a Graeco-Roman street layout, and there are signs of occupation dating back as far at the 10th-century BC. Hinting at its former glory, the city was even named the 'Islamic Capital of Culture 2006', although you won't find any tourists there today.The country is in the grip of a bloody and bitter civil war that shows no signs of abating, and the Foreign Office advises against all travel to the war-torn country. Bethlehem - Birthplace of Jesus: Church of the Nativity and the Pilgrimage Route . The Church of the Nativity is located within the Palestine occupied West Bank, an area that holidaymakers are advised to avoid . The alleged birthplace of Jesus: Positioned in the Palestine occupied West Bank - an area the Foreign Office says is 'currently tense' Six miles south of Jerusalem, on the site Christians have called the birthplace of Jesus since the 2nd century, is the Church of Nativity. The oldest church in daily use in the world, the original basilica  was built in 339 AD, and parts of it survive below ground. A cave, over which the first Church was built, is traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus. While the site sees streams of religious visitors, its positioning in the Palestinian occupied West Bank - an area the Foreign Office says is 'currently tense' means it's not one for the average tourist. And even if you do get to it, the church is in danger of crumbling - with the roof structure being vulnerable to lack of maintenance and repair. And due to an increase in the number of vehicles, as well as unregulated tourism, pollution now affects its outside walls. Its preservation relies on the unlikely partnership of the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, so it remains at high risk. Timbuktu - Mali . Timbuktu was founded in the 5th century and came to prominence in the 15th and 16th centuries when it was a centre for learning . Desertification has left many of Timbuktu's buildings vulnerable, while political instability in the region prohibits all but essential travel . Remote, yet endlessly fascinating, Timbuktu  has become synonymous with inaccessibility over the centuries. Once hailed as the intellectual and spiritual capital of Islam in Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries, today the city remains as distant and increasingly isolated. Founded in the 5th century, Timbuktu was previously a thriving economic and cultural hub in spite of its isolation, and the mosques and holy shrines in the city once played an essential role in the spread of Islam throuhgout Africa. Situated in the gateway to the Sahara desert, the ancient mosques and libraries of Timbuktu are under now at the mercy of the elements. Climate change and desertification has left many of the buildings vulnerable, and continued political instability in the region prohibits all but essential travel. Democratic Republic of Congo - Kahuzi-Biega National Park . Kahuzi-Biega National Park (right) is home to one of the last remaining groups of eastern lowland gorillas (left) - but only around 250 remain . The Kahuzi-Biega National Park covers a vast area of tropical rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo that is dominated by two dormant volcanos - Kahuzi and Biega. The Park's diverse flora and fauna make it one of the most ecologically rich in the world, let alone Africa, and it's home to one of the last remaining groups of eastern lowland gorillas. However, despite efforts to preserve the population, only 250 gorillas remain in the park at present, and poaching and political instability in the region have left the Park exposed to worrying levels of destruction. The country is virtually off-limits to travellers with the Foreign Office guidance advising against all but essential travel to most regions. And the endangered sites should visit before they disappear: . Belize - Barrier reef . The barrier reef in Belize is the largest in the Northern and Western Hemispheres and is famed for its pristine corals and clear blue water . Coastal development and tourism also put pressure on the stunning, but fragile, ecosystem, so if you do travel there, be responsible . The barrier reef in Belize is the largest in the Northern and Western Hemispheres and is famed for its pristine corals, crystal-clear waters and white sandy beaches. It is also home to the a number of threatened species, including the West Indian manatee, hawksbill turtles and the American crocodile. However, much like the iconic Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the future of the reef in Belize is under constant threat from a number of factors including climate change, coral bleaching and the frequent hurricanes that blight the region. Coastal development and tourism have also put pressure on the stunning, but incredibly fragile, ecosystem, so if you do travel there, be a responsible tourist! Peru - Chimu Kingdom, Chan Chan . In its prime during the 15th century, the vast kingdom was the largest earthen city in pre-Columbian America . The walls of the buildings in the vast city were often decorated with intricate friezes representing abstract motifs . While Machu Picchu may be more well-known, the remains of the Chimu kingdom in Peru are just as fascinating. The walls of the buildings in the vast city were often decorated with intricate friezes representing abstract motifs, although the fragile nature of the earthen structures mean the site is slowing-but-surely eroding, so get there soon if you can. In its prime during the 15th century, the kingdom was the largest earthen city in pre-Colombian America and the remains of temples, dwellings, irrigation systems and funeral platforms can still be seen today. United Kingdom - Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City . Today, the city the thriving city is perhaps best known for The Beatles and the its football teams, but its rich mercantile heritage lives on . A little closer to home, the city of Liverpool has a rich maritime heritage and was once a thriving commercial port. In the 18th and 19th centuries the city played an integral role in the growth the of British Empire - a legacy that remains to this day. During this time, the city pioneered the development of modern dock technology and transport systems, and was a major port for the mass emigration of people to America. Today, the city the thriving city is perhaps best known for The Beatles and the its football teams, but its rich mercantile heritage lives on, despite the threat of urban sprawl and new developments that are unsympathetic to the vernacular of its historic buildings. Colombia - Los Katios National Park . Los Katios National Park is home to countless endangered species - including the Central American Tapir and the Giant Anteater (left) After years spent in the tourism doldrums, visitor numbers are finally on the increase in Colombia as the South American country enjoys a period of relative political calm. If you are planning a trip, consider a diversion to Los Katios National Park, which is home to countless endangered species - including the Central American Tapir - as well as incredible flora and fauna. Situated in the North West of the country, 95 per cent of the park is considered to be in pristine condition, but the threat of pollution, illegal hunting and agricultural sprawl remains an ever-present threat. Indonesia - Tropical rainforests of Sumatra . The parks are home to an estimated 10,000 species of plants, around 200 species of mammal - including the Sumatran tiger . This once vast island of tropical rainforest has shrunk significantly over the past 50 years due to illegal logging, among other things . The tropical rainforests in Sumatra comprises three national parks: Gunung Leuser National Park, Kerinci Seblat National Park and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. Collectively, the parks are home to an estimated 10,000 species of plants, around 200 species of mammal - including the Sumatran tiger - and around 580 species of birds, making it an ideal destination for animal lovers. But this once vast island of tropical rainforest has shrunk significantly over the past 50 years. The spread of illegal logging, encroaching agriculture and poaching have devastated some parts of the rainforest and still pose a significant threat.","There are 1007 incredible sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List .

"A man standing trial after being accused of robbing a bank in California was likely left with a bad taste in his mouth after an apparent bid to convince the jury he was insane proved unsuccessful. While he was testifying at San Luis Obispo Superior Court last week, Andrew Gilbertson pulled some feces out of his pants and ate it. He was on trial for robbing a Bank of America branch in the central California city in 2013. Scroll down for video . Andrew Gilbertson was standing trial in San Luis Obispo Superior Court in California for a 2013 bank robbery . While he was testifying, the 40-year-old defendant reached into his pants, pulled out feces and then ate it . Gilbertson's attempt to convince the jury he was insane didn't work and he was found guilty of robbery . Gilbertson, 40, was pleading not guilty by reason of insanity and claimed he heard voices in his head, according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune. His defense attorney, Brian Buckley, apologized after the excrement eating. Buckley said: 'When I said this was going to be an unusual case, that wasn't what I was expecting.' Despite his unorthodox attempt to convince the jury he was insane during the robbery, Gilbertson was found guilty of robbery and burglary. Deputy District Attorney Dave Pomeroy told the jury, who took about half a day to hand down the verdict, that Gilbertson was sane when he robbed the bank and when he ate his poop. Pomeroy said: 'That was upsetting a couple of days ago. 'Obviously, it was designed to produce emotion.' He added that Gilbertson showed off his hands during the stunt to 'be sure you all clearly understood what he had in his hand and what he was doing'. The district attorney argued Gilbertson  pulled off the heist because he 'really, really likes methamphetamine' Gilbertson said the Virgin Mary told him to disguise himself and rob the Bank of America in San Luis Obispo . He has previous convictions for sexual battery, aggravated battery and failure to register as a sex offender . Before he ate his waste, Gilbertson told the jury the Virgin Mary told him to wear a disguise and rob the Bank of America, KSBY reported. The district attorney argued Gilbertson had a much different reason for pulling off the heist. Pomeroy said: 'He just wanted methamphetamine. 'He testified that he really, really likes methamphetamine.' Gilbertson has previous convictions for sexual battery, aggravated battery, failure to register as a sex offender and car theft. A sentencing date for his latest conviction has not been set.","Andrew Gilbertson on trial at San Luis Obispo Superior Court in California .

"Secretary of State John Kerry spent five minutes of a Senate hearing excoriating a group of 47 Republicans who sent a highly unusual letter to the government of Iran warning that Congress could modify the terms of any nuclear deal it negotiates with the White House. 'This letter raises questions of judgment and policy,' he insisted, before Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker cut him off and scolded him for delivering 'a well-written speech.' 'It's not a speech! This is not a speech!' Kerry erupted. 'This is a statement about the impact of this irresponsible letter. The letter does not have legal authority, and I think you have to ask what people are trying to accomplish.' Kerry later staked out a position that lawmakers have no standing to change any nuclear agreement between the U.S. and Iran because it won't be 'legally binding' in the first place. Scroll down for video . Secretary of State John Kerry testified on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday, saying Congress won't have a role in determining the terms of a nuclear deal with Iran because the agreement isn't 'legally binding' A Code Pink protester holding a sign saying 'There is no military solution' in the Middle East was removed from Wednesday's hearing after heckling Kerry . IT'S A NICE SPEECH: Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker scolded Kerry for lecturing his former Senate colleagues about the role of Congress in ratifying deals with other countries . 'We've been clear from the beginning: We're not negotiating a, quote, ""legally binding"" plan,' Kerry told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 'We're negotiating a plan that will have in it the capacity for enforcement. We don't even have diplomatic relations with Iran right now.' He blamed Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton and 46 other GOP senators for signing a letter on Monday that 'ignores more than two centuries of precedent in the conduct of American foreign policy.' Kerry, America's top diplomat and the Obama administration's senior Tehran negotiator, said he reacted with 'utter disbelief' to the letter, which also warned Iran's leaders that an accord with President Barack Obama's team could expire the day he leaves office. The letter itself is an unprecedented intervention by Congress into negotiations with a foreign power, Kerry suggested. 'During my 29 years in the Senate I never heard of, or even heard of it being proposed, anything comparable to this,' he said. 'This letter ignores more than two centuries of precedent in the conduct of American foreign policy.' 'When it says that Congress could actually modify the terms of an agreement at any time is flat wrong,' said Kerry, who once chaired the committ he addressed on Wednedsay. 'You don't have the right to modify an agreement reached executive to executive between leaders of a country.' Cotton, a freshman senator, does not sit on the Foreign Relations panel. The administration has been forced into a no-win situation in the Middle East, with the so-called 'Islamic State' gaining territory in Iraq while the Iranians help push them back. 'They want us to destroy ISIS. They want to destroy ISIS,' Kerry said during an exchange with Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. 'ISIS is a threat to them,' he said of Iran. 'It is a threat to the region. I think you are misreading it if you think there is not a mutual interest.' Kerry claimed the U.S. has 'the capacity' to 'knock out ISIL' on its own, but 'we're not going to get suckered into that.' 'The enduring transformation that has to take place here is not going to take place if the United States just comes in and were to knock out ISIL and that’s it – go away,' he said, adding that it's 'not gonna happen.' But Cotton's letter, also signed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and several Republican presidential hopefuls, was Exhibit A on Wednesday. Formal treaties require ratification by two-thirds of the Senate, but 'the vast majority of international arrangements and agreements do not,' Kerry said. 'And around the world today we have all kinds of executive agreements that we deal with,' including 'any number of noncontroversial, broadly supported foreign policy goals.' START OF IT ALL: Arkansas freshman Senator Tom Cotton wrote a letter to Iran's leaders and persuaded 46 other Republicans in the Senate to sign it with him . The Obama administration and Senate Democrats have harshly condemned Cotton's letter, which was presented to leaders of the Islamic republic as a primer on the U.S. Constitution. It warned that 'the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.' As Kerry's turn on the hot seat began, protesters from the liberal anti-war group Code Pink interrupted – as they have done in other recent hearings. Like Arizona Sen. John McCain, who last month called them 'low-life scum' as they were led out of a hearing room, Kerry fired back at a woman who shouted repeatedly that 'the United States is killing innocent civilians with drones!' 'Killing more innocent people?' he asked aloud. 'I wonder how our journalists, who were beheaded, and a pilot who was fighting for freedom – burned alive – what they would have to say to their efforts to protect innocent people.' ENEMY OF MY ENEMY: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio heard Kerry say that Iran is helpful in fighting the ISIS terror army . The secretary of state will meet Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, next week in Switzerland for another round of talks. He said Cotton's letter 'erroneously asserts that this is a legally binding plan. It's not, that's number one.' 'Number two, it's incorrect when it says that Congress could actually modify the terms of an agreement at any time. That's flat wrong,' he continued. 'They don't have the right to modify an agreement reached executive to executive between leaders.' Neither the U.S. nor Iran has emphasized the need for a legally binding deal because each has stronger forms of leverage. If Iran cheats, the Obama administration has spoken of re-imposing suspended sanctions. The U.S. has also held out the prospect of military action if Iran makes progress toward a nuclear weapon. Similarly, if the U.S. doesn't live up to its side of the bargain, the Iranians can ramp up enrichment levels of uranium, taking them closer to nuclear weapons capacity. Congress, too, wields a threat: new forms of economic punishment of Iran that would be forbidden in the agreement. But such a move would almost surely require overriding a presidential veto and could pin any diplomatic collapse on the United States. Negotiators from the U.S., Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia hope to seal a framework with Iran by month's end and a comprehensive agreement by July. Kerry scoffed at the notion that Obama's successor would discard a deal reached between so many powerful governments and adhered to by Iran. 'I'd like to see the next president, if all of those countries have said this is good and it's working, turn around and just nullify it on behalf of the United States,' he said. 'That's not going to happen.' READY TO MAKE HISTORY: Kerry shook hands with new Defense Secretary Ash Carter (left) as protesters anticipated the start of Wednesday's hearing . Questions about the process involved in any agreement with Shiite-majority Iran are sensitive for a variety of reasons. Israel, Sunni Arab countries and many U.S. lawmakers are concerned that international negotiators could be placing too much trust in Iran. The prospects of a 'nonbinding' pact will hardly alleviate their concerns, even if none of them have professed faith in Iran abiding by the terms of an agreement that would ease sanctions in exchange for at least a decade of strict limits on the Iranian nuclear program. Iran says its program is solely for peaceful energy and medical research purposes. On Tuesday, Jen Psaki, Kerry's spokeswoman, raised the possibility of the deal assuming legal character through the U.N. Security Council. Psaki didn't speak definitively on the matter but cited the example of a 2013 strategy agreed to between the U.S. and Russia on Syria relinquishing its chemical weapons stockpile. That plan was then endorsed by the United Nations' top body. 'This framework was not legally binding and was not subject to congressional approval,' Psaki told reporters during a daily press briefing. 'It outlined steps for eliminating Syria's chemical weapons and helped lay the groundwork for successful multilateral efforts to move forward.' In that case, she added, the U.S.-Russian agreement 'went to the U.N. to the Security Council vote.' Zarif is the only one who has gone on record saying such a model would be followed with a nuclear deal. U.S. negotiators have been more circumspect. Making such a declaration would amount to telling Congress that it won't have a say on the accord, because it is not a treaty, but that the United Nations will.","Secretary of State testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .

"This pair of cute husky puppies may look sweet as they cuddle up to groups of soldiers, but these images help prove an open secret Russia's president does not want the world to know. The shots were posted on social media by Russian troops from military unit 46108, the 5th Tank Brigade, based in Buryatia, which lies between Lake Baikal and Mongolia in the far east of Siberia. A keen-eyed blogger has used them to help prove these soldiers have been fighting and dying very far away from there in eastern Ukraine - something Vladimir Putin has always denied. They back up the account of a 20-year-old tankist who claims he was hurt fighting in a civil war which has torn Ukraine apart, according to blogger Aric Toler. A Russian soldier in the 5th Tank Brigade with two Siberian huskies, apparently at the Kusminsky military base near the Ukrainian border. This helps bolster claims of direct Russian involvement in the civil war . The dogs all have exactly the same markings, helping to provide a common thread between all the images . The brigade's stay at the base over the winter was likely in preparation for crossing the Ukrainian border and joining the fight on the separatist rebel side . This is because the shots of the Siberian huskies, unmistakably the same ones given the identical patterns on their fur, provide a common thread linking images which all purport to show the brigade members at the Kuzminsky military base in Russia near the Ukrainian border. On March 2 the tankist in question, Dorzhi Batomunkuyev, gave an explosive interview to Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta in which he claimed to have sustained injuries fighting against government forces in Ukraine. His brigade's stay at Kuzminsky over the winter, in preparation for crossing the border and joining the fight on the separatist rebel side, was a key part of the young soldier's account. In the background of the photographs with the dogs various elements of the camp - including tents, military equipment and trenches - are visible, helping to confirm its existence and the specific military units stationed there. The photographs themselves are also geotagged as being taken at the base which, along with the common thread of the two huskies and satellite imagery showing military hardware stationed in the area, makes it safe to say that members of the 5th Tank Brigade, and other Russian tank brigades, were stationed at the Kuzminsky base. In the background of the photographs  various elements of the camp - including tents, military equipment and trenches - are visible, helping to confirm its existence and the specific military units stationed there . A number of images of Russian tanks with their marking obscured were posted on social network VK . A Russian tank with the identification number on its hull covered over can be seen in the background here . The ploy was most likely done to make it harder to identify the tanks as Russian when they rolled into Ukraine . According to Toler all of this gives credibility to Batomunkuyev's more revealing claims that he was hurt on February 19 when being fired upon by Ukrainian soldiers in the deadly 'Debaltseve pocket' near the strategic transport hub seized by rebel forces. A despatch from separatist fighters on February 19 describes how the road between Debaltseve-Artemivsk in the area of Lohvynove became a 'road of death' for Ukrainian soldiers - though Russian fighter Batomunkuyev escaped with his life. This satellite shot shows a build up of military vehicles around the Kuzminsky base . He is apparently far from home recovering from serious injuries in Rostov near the Ukrainian border after being transferred from a burn recovery unit in a Donetsk. The photographs of tanks on the Kuzminsky training ground show numerous examples of the identification numbers on their hulls being obscured - exactly the kind of ploy which would make them harder to identify as Russian when they most likely rolled into Ukraine. Toler writes: 'Geotagged locations on VK [a Russian social network] are often unreliable, but there is a common thread that links many soldiers together to confirm that they were at the same place at roughly the same time: two Siberian husky puppies. 'It is quite rare to have a common identifying feature that is unique to a specific date and time when conducting geolocation, but this is such a case. 'And yes, much like some camouflage patterns on uniforms and tanks, the fur patterns of the puppies match perfectly in each photograph.' 'The cumulative effect of all of these details is hard to dispute.

"Mohammed Emwazi has apologised to his parents for bringing shame to the family after being unmasked as ISIS butcher 'Jihadi John'. But the 26-year-old executioner, who has murdered a number of western hostages, including two British aid workers, has not expressed any remorse for the barbaric killings. Emwazi's family have been forced into hiding since his identity was revealed. Scroll down for video . Killer: Mohammed Emwazi, left in the most recent photograph known to have been taken of him before he entered Syria to join ISIS militants. He has apologised to his parents for bringing shame to his family after being unmasked as ISIS butcher 'Jihadi John' The 26-year-old executioner, who has murdered a number of western hostages, including two British aid workers, has not expressed any remorse for the barbaric killings . They were advised to leave their £600,000 council house for their own safety, and now his mother is living at a secret location under police protection along with four out of his five brothers and sisters. Meawhile, his father and eldest sister are in Kuwait. The Sunday Times reports that Emwazi had sent an apology via a third party for the 'problems and trouble the revelation of his identity has caused'. In the Islamic faith it is believed that those who disobey or disrespect their parents are more likely to go to hell. Kuwaiti MPs have told Emwazi's father, Jasem, to publicly distance himself from his son's actions by apologising – or leave the country. Kuwaitis have become increasingly frustrated with the mixed messages coming from 51-year-old British citizen Mr Emwazi, whose family are said to have cost the British tax-payer up to £400,000 in the 20 years they have lived in the UK. Kuwaiti MPs have told Emwazi's father, Jasem, to publicly distance himself from his son's actions by apologising – or leave the country . Last week, Mr Emwazi told former workmates his son was a 'dog' and hoped he would die. Just a few days later,  lawyers acting for Mr Emwazi in Kuwait suggested there was 'no proof' that the masked executioner-in-chief was in fact Mohammed. Mr Emwazi is believed to have been living in Kuwait with his eldest daughter Asma, 25, for the last two years. His wife Ghaneya and four other children remained in London – and are now guarded by armed police in a hotel at a reported cost of £5,000 a day. It has also been reported that Westminster council is still paying the rent on the family's £600,000 flat -  even though the rules say housing benefit should normally be stopped after 13 weeks. As members of the stateless Bedoon ethnic group, the Emwazis were granted asylum in the UK, claiming to have fled Kuwait in fear of persecution.","Mohammed Emwazi has apologised to parents for bringing shame to family .

"It has famously been a showcase for fast cars, flash watches and high-class liquor - but the latest Bond instalment is set to go one step further by promoting an entire country for tax-breaks. The new movie, Spectre, will be a truly pro-Mexican affair with beautiful shots of the country, a leading role for one of the nation's most glamorous actress and a strict rule that Bond's nemesis is not from Mexico. In exchange for these considerable lengths, the Hollywood producers making the film, who are under pressure to cut their huge budget, will have an extra £14million to spend how they choose. Scroll down for video . Starring role: Glamorous Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman was recently unveiled as new Bond girl Estrella . The Central American country, where the iconic opening scene takes place, offered Hollywood producers a fortune as an incentive to film there, but their generosity came with conditions. Stephanie Sigman, one of Mexico's rising stars, was recently unveiled as Bond girl Estrella, appearing alongside Italian Monica Bellucci, who plays Lucia Sciarra. The Mexican actress, 27, is best known for her role in the award-winning Mexican film Miss Bala, in which she played a beauty queen forced to do a gang's dirty work after witnessing a murder. In addition, Mexico also asked that an assassination target in the film, the Mayor of Mexico City, be changed to an international leader, The Telegraph reports. Tax incentives: It is believed that Hollywood producers making the new Bond movie will save as much as £14million by showing Mexico in a favourable light . These measures are said to have secured tax breaks worth £10million. Around £4million was said to have been earned by filming flattering shots of the country's 'modern' skyline and replacing a cage fighting scene with footage of Mexico's renowned Day of the Dead festivities. Stephanie Sigman will be the first Mexican-born Bond girl on the big screen, but not the first overall. Mexico's Linda Christian - the original Bond girl - starred in the 1954 television adaptation of Casino Royale. The movie's alterations were reported by US website Tax Analysts, which provides information on tax news, based on emails leaked in last year's Sony hacking scandal. Large numbers of internal emails were released by Guardians of the Peace, which the FBI has since identified as a North Korean-backed group of hackers. According to the leaked emails Spectre's budget was at one point exceeding £200 million - which would have made it one of the most expensive films in history. Studio executives spoke of being under 'immense pressure' to reduce the budget. The plan to give Mexico a flattering portrayal was outlined in a memo titled 'Elements needed to preserve Mexican deal'. It spoke of how producers should cast a 'known Mexican actress' as Estrella and female villain Sciarra 'cannot be Mexican'. It also called for aerial shots of 'modern Mexico City buildings'. Rising star: Ms Sigman (pictured left in an advert for her hit Mexican film Miss Bala) will star alongside Daniel Craig and Italian actress Monica Bellucci, who who plays Lucia Sciarra . Another condition: Other leaked Sony emails suggested Bond producers were asked to film shots with Mexico's 'modern' skyline in the background . Other emails suggested the Mayor of Mexico City should no longer be assassinated while it was decided Bond would steal Sciarra's helicopter and take off 'into the Mexican skyline'. A senior studio executive later wrote to producers saying: 'You have done a great job in getting us the Mexican incentive. 'By all accounts we can still get the extra $6M by continuing to showcase the modern aspects of the city, and it sounds like we are well on our way based on your last scout. Let's continue to pursue whatever avenues we have available to maximise this incentive.' In an email Amy Pascal, the former co-chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment, added: 'We should insist they add whatever travelogue footage we need in Mexico to get the extra money.' Sony Pictures Entertainment has not  commented on the Mexico tax incentives. The new film, set to be released in the autumn, had  budget exceeding £200million, which would have made it one of the most expensive movies in history .","New Bond movie, Spectre, sees iconic opening scene filmed in Mexico .

"A new species of bug-eyed catfish with a suckermouth has been named after the Star Wars character Greedo. The catfish has been named by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, in Alabama, as Peckoltia greedoi after the fictional alien bounty hunter. The fish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil and has large dark eyes, protruding birstles and a sucker mouth. The new species of catfish Peckoltia greedoi (left) has large eyes and a sucker mouth much like the bounty hunter Greedo (right) in that featured briefly at the start of the first installment of the original Star Wars films . Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films. Yoda purpurata - a deep sea worm . Han solo - an extinct species of trilobite found in southern China . Aptostichus sarlaac - a species of trapdoor spider . Tetramorium jedi - a Madagascan ant . Darthvaderum - an Australian arboreal mite . Polemistus chewbacca - a wasp . Agathidium vaderi - a species of beetle . He said: 'Chris looked at the specimen and said ""that looks like that guy from Star Wars"". 'After a little prodding, I realised he was talking about Greedo. 'We then knew what the name had to be. 'The Peckoltia greedoi does bear a striking resemblance to Greedo. 'As a seven-year-old kid, I watched Star Wars in the theatre and it was a life-changing experience for me. 'I became a lifelong fan, and I now share that with my son. 'Greedo has always been a personal favourite of mine.' Greedo, a bug-eyed green alien from the spaceport Mos Espa, was killed by Han Solo in a brief scene close to the start of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. It is not the first new species to be named after characters from the Star Wars films. Even though taxonomy is considered to be a serious business, those naming new species often have a lot of fun with the names. In 2012 marine biologists named a purple deep sea worm Yoda purpurata after the Jedi knight from Star Wars - Yoda. Professor Jonathan Armbruster (pictured above on the right with student Carrie Allison left) named the new species of catfish after his favourite character from the Star Wars films that he watched as a young boy . Peckoltia greedoi (shown above) has bug-eyes, bristles on its cheeks and a large sucker mouth . There is also a small parasite that lives on a burrowing crab known as Albunione yoda. A fossil trilobite which was found to belong to a new genus was given the name Han solo by a palaeobiologist Samuel Turvey. Jason Bong, director of the Auburn University Museum of Natural Hisotry also named a new species of trapdoor spider the Aptostichus sarlaac, after the sarlacc monster that appears in the Return of the Jedi. A species of ant in Madagascar is called Tetramorium jedi, while an entire genus of mite in Australia is called Darthvaderum. There are also three species of wasp called Polemistus chewbacca, Polemistus vaderi and Polemistus yoda. Professor Armbuster himself has named more than 40 new species of fish. Peckoltia greedoi was first discovered in 1998 but had not been described as a new species until this year. Two other new species - Peckoltia ephippiata and Peckoltia lujani - were found alongside it. He said: 'In biology, taxonomy is probably the most important science. 'We have not even completed cataloging all of the species found locally, and in places like South America, it sometimes feels like we have barely started. 'We need names to be able to discuss anything about the biology of the organisms, and it is the one branch of biology used by every biologist alive.' The purple deep sea worm above was named Yoda purpurata, after the Jedi knight from the Star Wars films .

"Uber has opened up its online booking to allow any app to call a car. Previously, only a handful of Uber's corporate partners had permission to hail Uber cars directly. Now, the ride-hailing service hopes app developer will boost its usage by including car-hailing capabilities. The firm said it hoped developers would use the system to make their apps 'smarter'. In blog post Uber recently said it would be partnering with roboticists at Carnegie Mellon University. It is said to have opened a research facility in Pittsburgh with the intention of creating a self-driving car, going head-to-head with Google's efforts. Google was an early backer of the San Francisco-based firm, investing $258 million (£170 million) in the controversial ride-sharing service through its venture capital arm in August 2013. David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer and senior vice president of corporate development, then joined the Uber board of directors. Uber is already working with companies such as Starbucks, United, OpenTable, TimeOut and TripAdvisor - but  now anyone can write an app that uses Uber. 'This makes great business sense for us and our driver partners,' said Rahul Bijor, API product manager at Uber. 'Every new ride request that comes through the API means even more business for our driver partners,' he said. The firm said it hoped developers would use the system to make their apps 'smarter'. 'We are eager to make this endpoint available because we know how satisfying it is to create technology that impacts the physical world,' the firm said. 'Putting this power in the hands of developers has our imaginations running wild. 'Should an Uber be waiting immediately after your last meeting of the day? Will someone create a way to request a car with just a simple SMS? We have no idea what you might build, but we cannot wait to find out.' The ride-hailing company, which links drivers to riders through an app, announced plans this month to create 1 million jobs for women as drivers by 2020 — suggesting aggressive growth plans for the coming five years. In the U.S., where Uber got its start six years ago, the company boasts 160,000 active drivers - just 14% of them are women. 'Uber does not require (minimum) hours, and it does not require a schedule,' Salle Yoo, Uber's general counsel, said in an interview on Monday, referring to why women might find working for Uber attractive. 'It offers the chance to be entrepreneurial, the chance to balance work and family.' Female passengers will not yet have the ability to request female drivers, Yoo said. She emphasized the app's safety features, including the notification of the driver's identity received by customers on their phones beforehand, and the ability to share via text message an estimated arrival time with others. The pledge comes as the rapidly expanding company deals with fallout over incidents of assaults by drivers from Boston and Chicago to Delhi. In the highest-profile case, an Indian woman said in December her driver raped her in Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. Uber screens drivers, including the use of background checks that vary from country to country. It does not hire drivers as full employees. Instead, it lets them use the smartphone-based app to connect them to passengers looking for a paid ride, and takes a cut of the fare. The ride-hailing company, which links drivers to riders through an app, announced plans this month to create 1 million jobs for women as drivers by 2020 — suggesting aggressive growth plans for the coming five years. Uber lets consumers use an app to locate a driver and instantly book a ride. Google Maps software is already integrated into Uber to let users check progress of drivers on their way to pick them up. San Francisco-based Uber has grown into one of the world's largest start-ups, and now operates in more than 200 cities in 54 countries around the world. But the app's growth has also cause friction with existing taxi operations, and posed challenges for regulators. Uber does not employ drivers or own its vehicles, but instead uses independent contractors with their own cars. Since launching in 2010, Uber has also been dubbed a prime example of a 'disruptive' economic force, and taxi drivers in dozens of cities have staged protests against the firm.","Uber told MailOnline it expects to close the deCarta deal 'later this week'

"They have been blamed for casting a shadow over urban areas and occasionally creating a 'death ray-style' beam of sunlight capable of melting cars on the street. So architects have now designed skyscrapers which don't block out the light by diffusing it onto a wide area in a bid to tackle the problem of shade encroaching on public space in London. The revolutionary 'No Shadow' design is the brainchild of architects NBBJ, who used a computer program to design two buildings, which work together to disperse and refract sunlight. They are designed so that when one building creates shade, the other can act as a huge curved mirror, allowing the light to be reflected downwards into its shadow. Architects have designed skyscrapers which don't block out the light by diffusing it onto a wide area . The theoretical development has been touted for construction at the Greenwich Peninsula, close to the O2 Arena, but similar buildings could be constructed in cities all over the world. Christian Coop, NBBJ's design director, said: 'The relationship between the sun and shadow is the relationship between the two buildings. He said the project is about 'improving the quality of our urban environment... finding a way in which we can have the tall buildings we need without losing natural light on the areas below'. Mr Coop hopes that architects will use this type of modelling to see how their designs will affect the light levels around their buildings. The revolutionary 'No Shadow' design is the brainchild of architects NBBJ, who used a computer program to design two building . The theoretical development has been touted for construction at the Greenwich Peninsula, close to the O2 Arena . He said the method could also be adapted to control how much sunlight is reflected at different times of year. It is hoped that the design would avoid a repeat of London's disastrous 'Walkie Talkie' dubbed the 'Walkie Scorchie' which directed  fierce beams of sunlight capable of melting cars on the street. Peter Murray, head of the New London Architecture (NLA) forum, said the 'No Shadow' design was a 'perfectly feasible' theory. He added  that one of the problems people have with skyscrapers is the long shadows they cast: 'If you can reduce that, that must be a good thing.' They are designed so that when one building creates shade, the other can act as a huge curved mirror, allowing the light to be reflected downwards into its shadow . Planning permission has been approved or is pending approval for 236 new high-rise buildings in central London, pictured is the Gherkin, The Cheesegrater and The Walkie Talkie . Dr Philip Oldfield, an expert in tall buildings at the University of Nottingham's Department of Architecture, said: 'What's great about the project is the focus on tall-building form and shape, not only to look dramatic, but to contribute to creating a comfortable space at ground level.' Planning permission has been approved or is pending approval for 236 new high-rise buildings in central London. Described by the NLA as a 'veritable tsunami of towers', most will be apartment blocks rising from a minimum of 20 storeys to the current permitted maximum of 75. Sydney's One Central Park has moveable mirrors that reflect light onto shaded areas below or block the sun during the hot summer. It is hoped that the design would avoid a repeat of London's disastrous 'Walkie Talkie' which directed fierce beams of sunlight capable of melting cars on the street .

"Angie's List has announced it is canceling a $40 million expansion of its Indianapolis headquarters because of a new state law that critics say will promote discrimination based on sexual orientation. Chief executive officer of Angie's List Bill Oesterle said in a statement Saturday that the decision is a result of Indiana Governor Mike Pence signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- aimed at preventing laws that 'substantially burden' a person's free exercise of religion.

"Two New York cops that plied an alleged rape victim with alcohol before one attempted to grope her, have admitted to wrongdoing but will get to keep their jobs. The incident occurred when the two NYPD officers, Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, flew to Seattle, Washington, to interview an alleged rape victim in July 2013. They ended up buying the 24-year-old rounds of drinks for nine hours, before Skorzewski took her back to their hotel, where he tried to tear off her clothes and grope her. During the encounter he allegedly told her 'You're my favorite victim.' Allegations: The unnamed woman, from Seattle, Washington, alleged that two NYPD officers plied her with rounds of drinks before Skorzewski attempted to grope her . Det. Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, left, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, pleaded guilty to departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media. They get to keep their jobs . Both policemen were hit with departmental charges after the unidentified woman's allegations made their way to the media. The two officers pleaded guilty to the charges on Monday, The New York Daily News reported. Skorzewski was demoted from detective after the trip, and was docked 30 vacation days and suspended for 10 days without pay as a result of pleading guilty. He has been transferred to the Medical Division in Queens on a year's probation. 'What the detective did was immoral, certainly. It was wrong. But it wasn't criminal,' a police source told the Daily News. Lamboy was already under investigation for overtime payments that he had not worked. He pleaded guilty to that charge too and was ordered to pay back more than $5,000 for 76 hours. For both charges he was docked 45 vacation days and suspended for 15 without pay. He has been transferred to Police Service Area 9 Viper in Flushing, Queens, a public housing unit. Lamboy lost his command as head of the NYPD's Manhattan Special Victims Division. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton will have to approve the final punishment. Sonia Ossorio, president of the National Organization for Women's New York City chapter, said in a statement: 'The idea of a special victims detective making a pass at a rape victim when he's charged with interviewing her about that rape shatters any notion of confidence in the NYPD's ability to regulate itself.' 'It's so far beyond the bounds of acceptability.' The alleged victim said that on the day of the incident she had lunch with Skorzewski, a married father of two, at a Seattle restaurant called the Skillet Diner. He spent time asking questions about her January 2013 rape case in which she alleges she was attacked by a man in a Union Square apartment in New York City. She was then taken to the Pier 58 tourist area to meet his boss, Lamboy. Sonia Ossorio of the National Organization for Women's New York chapter, says the case shatters  confidence in the NYPD's ability to regulate itself . She told The New York Daily News: 'Looking back, it was totally naive of me to join them. But I was like, 'This is really cool.' I really looked up to them.' 'Luke was actually the one who said, 'I don't know if you're going to be able to come because we're going to be drinking. 'But when I dropped him off, the lieutenant was the one who said, 'Oh, no, you should stay, come on,' she recalled. 'I was going through this all alone. My family didn't know,' she said. 'It felt good that they were being so nice.' They then went to Paddy Coyne's Irish Pub, but Skorzewski was so drunk that servers refused to give him any more alcohol. Later, they headed to Cha Cha Lounge in Capitol Hill and then moved on to Unicorn, with the cops flashing their badges to cut the line. She said that she attempted to leave at around midnight, but they begged her to stay. They even pleaded with her to call in sick to her job as a Starbucks barista the next morning. She was drunk and unable to drive, so she went with them after they assured her that she would be safe if she stayed with them at their hotel. They  took her back to their hotel room at the Embassy Suites hotel in nearby Bellevue, Washington. Once there, Skorzewski loaned her some clothes and slept on the couch, she said. But when they woke up with hangovers, Skorzewski climbed in bed with her as they watched TV and  asked to put his arm around her. She claims he said: 'I really want to kiss you right now.' He also wanted to 'feel her up.' She describes how he tried to work his way into her pants to tear them off but she pushed his hand away. The next day, both policemen visited her at Starbucks and promised to stay in touch. Pub: The accuser claimed Skorzewski had been so drunk that servers at an Irish bar in downtown Seattle refused to give him any more alcohol . She said Skorzewski called her almost daily from New York for a month but the calls soon stopped, and she was 'crushed.' She quizzed him about why he had become distant in an e-mail but he became angry suggesting that she had screwed up his personal life. She later saw Skorzewski in New York in October 2013 for a 'call' to the man who allegedly attacked her in January of that year. But the man was never charged. Skorzewski soon stopped returning her calls altogether, so she  sent a letter to a family friend in the NYPD which led to a call from the Internal Affairs Bureau. She told Internal affairs what happened and gave them evidence, including photos from the boozy night out, text messages and phone records which showed two-hour long calls with Skorzewski. Shortly after her claims were partially vindicated, Lamboy and Skorzewski were transferred from the elite Manhattan Special Victims Division. Today, the woman, who is now now studying nursing at a Manhattan university, says she feels guilty that the detective might lose his job.","The policemen pleaded guilty to the departmental charges and received docked pay and vacation days and were reassigned .

"A transgender teenager has taken his life a year after he became the first trans student to be crowned high school homecoming king in his city. Blake Brockington, who advocated for the rights of sexual minorities after coming out as transgender in his sophomore year, passed away on Monday night, LGBT publication QNotes reported. The 18-year-old had been nominated and later crowned homecoming king of East Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte, North Carolina last year before he graduated. It is believed to be the first time an openly transgender student has been given the title in Charlotte, according to QNotes. Loss: Blake Brockington, pictured as he was crowned homecoming king last year, has taken his life . Advocate: Brockington advocated for rights for sexual minorities and had led rallies against police brutality . 'I honestly feel like this is something I have to do,' Brockington told the publication. He won the title after collecting the most money for the school's chosen charity, Mothering Across Continents, and said he hoped his success would give younger transgender children, including a nine-year-old boy he mentored, strength and encouragement. 'I don't want him to ever have to be scared,' Brockington said. 'I feel like if I do this, that's one red flag for everybody to say, ""Nobody should be scared to be themselves and everybody should have an equal opportunity to have an enjoyable high school experience"".' But speaking to the Charlotte Observer in January, Brockington revealed how tough the homecoming king process had been. 'That was single-handedly the hardest part of my trans journey,' he said. 'Really hateful things were said on the Internet. It was hard. I saw how narrow-minded the world really is.' Younger years: Brockington is pictured as a baby with a relative. He was raised as a girl but said he never felt right wearing female clothes and came out as transgender in his sophomore year of high school . Fight: Blake, pictured ahead of a rally against police brutality last year, said his biological family had struggled to accept his gender identity and that he had moved in with a foster family . He also revealed the struggles he had faced growing up as transgender  and how bad things got at home after he went to his father and stepmother and told them he was a boy. 'My family feels like this is a decision I made,' he said. 'They think, ""You're already black, why would you want to draw more attention to yourself?"" But it's not a decision. It is who I am. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.' He moved in with a foster family and received counseling as he transitioned to Blake - a name he chose after it came to him in a dream - and began receiving hormone treatment. Following his homecoming king win, he became an advocate for LGBT issues and spoke at last year's Transgender Day of Remembrance event. He also took part in rallies against police brutality. Winner: He was crowned as homecoming king - beating 12 other contenders - of East Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte last year after raising $3,200 for the school's chosen charity . Celebration: He said competing for the crown had been tough because he received many hateful messages online but that he wanted to show transgender children that they could be successful at school . In December, he led activists as they briefly shut down Independence Square in Charlotte before marching through Uptown, QNotes reported. He also took part in the high school band, where he served as drum major, and played on the student rugby team, as well as being a top-grade student. His Facebook page shows was a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. His death was announced on Tuesday morning by Time Out Youth Center, a local LGBT youth services agency and confirmed by police.

"Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry compared legal U.S. immigrants to cardboard boxes on Saturday, bringing some in a Des Moines, Iowa audience to shake their head sin disbelief.. He said at the Iowa Ag Summit, a testing ground for potential presidential candidates, that the United States should be able to track holders of work visas the way shipping companies track parcels. 'I'm telling you,' Perry said, 'if UPS can track a box all around the world and know exactly where it is 24/7, we can give people a card and allow them in here, and say that when you hit your visa limit from the time to be in this country, we're going to know where you are.' 'We're going to let you know that your time's up. You're outta here.' 'YOU'RE OUTTA HERE': Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said the US government should track foreign guest workers like UPS tracks packages and deport them when their permits expire . Perry spoke at the 2015 Ag Summit, a testing ground for presidential hopefuls, in Des Moines, Iowa . SCAN IT: UPS keeps track of millions of packages around the world every day, far more than the hundreds of thousands of H1-B immigrants in the country legally at any given time . While some applauded, others grimaced. Most speakers during the morning session had harsh words for President Barack Obama's recent immigration executive actions, which promise to guarantee 5 million or more illegal immigrants that they won't be deported through the end of his White House term. But Perry distinguished himself by saying future presidents should embrace greater numbers of targeted legal immigrants. He hinted that a Perry administration in Washington would focus on 'bringing people into this country that we need, whether it's high-tech workers, or people in agriculture, hospitality or construction.' And, he added, the government would have to be 'able to identify these people – keep up with them.' Perry didn't say what kind of technology he advocated for keeping track of legal immigrants. America awards 85,000 so-called H-1B work visas, based on a computer-generated lottery system, including 20,000 with advanced academic qualifications like master's degrees or Ph.Ds. Last year the U.S. got 172,500 applications for fiscal 2015, and stopped acceepting them after just 7 days. The visa allows foreign nationals who do not intend to emigrate to the United States to work inside the country for three years, extendable to six. Many choose ultimately to stay beyond that timeframe – including all of the airline hijackers responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. According to a recent U.S. Customs and Immigration Services report to Congress, 61 per cent of the successful applicants in 2012 worked in 'computer-related occupations.' Other categories include 'specialty occupations' such as fashion modeling and healthcare work. That year visa holders' salaries averaged $79,000. Nearly three-quarters were between the ages of 25 and 34 that year. All told there were moew than 262,500 H1-B visa holders in the country in 2012, including holdovers from previous years. Perry also hammered the Obama administration for appointing Ron Klain as his Ebola czar – 'a political spokesperson for Al Gore!' And he complained that America's longest border with Mexico, in his home state of Texas, has been left largely undefended during the Obama years. 'I've got some experience with this,' he said. Tickets to legally enter the United States include 'H1-B' visas that allow holders to work in America for three years at a time . LESS SERIOUS: LIberal activists from family-farming and animal-rights groups picketed outside the Iowa Ag Summit on Saturday . Describing a 150-mile wide swath of southern Texas, he said that when Obama visited Texas in July 2014, that area was seeing '10,000-plus apprehensions a week.' The president, he recalled, has emphasized 'securing the border' as part of a comprehensive approach to immigration reform. 'We've heard that time after time after time,' he said. Perry also noted that the president . Eight other Republicans spoke Saturday, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. None of the high profile Democrats who were invited – including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton – made the trip.","'If UPS can track a box all around the world and know exactly where it is 24/7, we can give people a card ... we're going to know where you are'

"David Cameron has launched a searing personal attack on Labour rival Ed Miliband's plans to 'crawl up Downing Street on the coat-tails of the SNP'. The Prime Minister accused the Labour leader of heading a 'bunch or hypocritical, holier-than-thou, hopeless, sneering socialists' - but admitted the General Election is on a 'knife edge'. Addressing activists at the Conservative spring conference in Manchester, the Tory leader sought to cast the contest as a personal battle and suggested his counterpart 'hasn't got it'. Scroll down for video . Searing attack: David Cameron accused Ed Miliband of heading a 'bunch or hypocritical, holier-than-thou, hopeless, sneering socialists' David Cameron, pictured with wife Samantha, admitted that the General Election next month was on a 'knife edge' Mr Cameron also set out to woo voters with the promise of a 'truly seven-day' NHS if the Conservatives are returned to power on May 7 . He also set out to woo voters with the promise of a 'truly seven-day' NHS if the Conservatives are returned to power on May 7 vowing to ensure patients would be given full access to hospital services seven-days a week by the end of the parliament in 2020. But he coupled his promise of better healthcare with a blistering personal attack on Mr Miliband, warning that the Labour leader was not up to the demands of leading the country. 'Now five years in this job teaches you some things. I know what this role needs - and frankly, I don't think Ed Miliband has it,' he said. 'Some might say ""Don't make this personal"", but when it comes to who's prime minister, the personal is national. 'The guy who forgot to mention the deficit could be the one in charge of our whole economy. 'The man who is too weak to stand up to the trade unions at home could be the one facing down our enemies abroad. 'The leader who thinks leadership is climbing aboard the latest bandwagon - he could be the one taking the make-or-break calls in the middle of the night.' The Prime Minister (pictured with wife Samantha) said that under Mr Miliband, Labour was no longer the party of working people, having betrayed its traditional values . Thumbs up: Mr Cameron delivered his first major rallying speech since MPs left Westminster for the campaign trail . Mr Cameron said that only he or Mr Miliband could enter No 10 after May 7 - as he accused the Labour leader of planning to 'crawl up Downing Street on the coat-tails of the SNP'. He said that under Mr Miliband, Labour was no longer the party of working people, having betrayed its traditional values. 'The truth is that Miliband's Labour Party isn't about liberating working people - it's about telling you what to do,' he said. 'The same old condescending, bossy, interfering, we-know-best attitude of the Hampstead socialist down the ages.' On the NHS, he acknowledged that gaining access to healthcare services outside normal working hours was 'too hard' but pledged that would change under a Conservative government. 'For years it's been too hard to access the NHS out of hours. But illness doesn't respect working hours. Heart attacks, major accidents, babies - these things don't just come from nine to five,' he will say. Mr Cameron (pictured arriving at the conference with wife Samantha) said that only he or Mr Miliband could enter No 10 after May 7 . The Tory leader sought to cast the contest as a personal battle and suggested Ed Miliband (pictured at the launch of the Labour general election campaign) 'hasn't got it' 'And the truth is that you are actually more likely to die if you turn up at the hospital at the weekend. Some of the resources are not up and running. The key decision-makers aren't always there. 'With a future Conservative government, we would have a truly seven day NHS. 'Already millions more people can see a GP seven days a week, but by 2020 I want this for everyone with hospitals properly staffed, especially for urgent and emergency care, so that everyone will have access to the NHS services they need seven days a week by 2020 - the first country in the world to make this happen.' Mr Cameron delivered his first major rallying speech since MPs left Westminster for the campaign trail surrounded by giant posters featuring party slogans at the old Granada studios. The Conservatives have been on a drive to win back the voters in the north of England it needs if it is to secure an overall majority on May 7. However the plan came under attack from doctors' leaders who accuse the Prime Minister of 'shameless political game playing'. Dr Mark Porter, who chairs the British Medical Association council, said the Conservatives had not even committed the funds needed to maintain existing services. 'The £2 billion extra funding that has been pledged falls far short of what is needed to deliver existing services, let alone fund additional care,' he said. 'The NHS is recovering from one of the worst winter crises on record, during which some hospitals were forced to close their doors because they couldn't cope. 'With existing services stretched to breaking point, a majority of hospitals facing crippling budget deficits and frontline staff under extreme pressure, the NHS needs far more than just words to deliver extra care. David Cameron and wife Samantha  talk to Urology Clinical Director Mr David Shackley (left) during a visit to the Salford Royal Hospital before speaking at the Conservative Spring Forum . 'Without a detailed, fully-costed plan to provide the staff and resources needed to deliver more seven-day services, this is at best an empty pledge and at worst shameless political game playing with the NHS ahead of the election.' Before the PM took to the stage, Chancellor George Osborne pushed his vision of a 'Northern Powerhouse' including considerably enhanced powers for local authorities in Greater Manchester, under an elected mayor. And he took the chance to twist Mr Miliband's words from Thursday's televised election grilling into a barb at the expense of the Opposition leader. 'I was listening to Ed Miliband, with all that legendary statesmanship of his, saying ""hell, yeah, I'll be a leader"",' he said. 'I'll tell you where that leads: a return to rising unemployment; a return to rising debts; a return to economic chaos. 'Hell? Yes indeed.' Labour's campaign vice chair Lucy Powell accused the Conservatives of misleading voters, saying their spending plans would mean ""extreme"" cuts to the NHS. Mr Cameron's speech was briefly interrupted by a heckle from audience member Mike Howson who said he shouted: 'You have betrayed this country on immigration and Europe' 'On the NHS, David Cameron misled people in 2010 and he's misleading them again today,' she said. 'When he pledges seven-day-a-week care in the NHS, people will remember that he did exactly the same before the last election, only to break his word. After five years of the Tories it's harder to see your GP and A&Es are in crisis.' A Liberal Democrat spokesman said that NHS England already had plans in place to move towards hospitals and GPs being open seven days a week. 'To keep this sustainable we need to back the NHS with more investment. Only the Liberal Democrats have a credible plan to invest the £8 billion per year by 2020 that NHS bosses say is needed,' the spokesman said. Ukip health spokesman Louise Bours said: 'If the Tories were serious about the NHS they would have brought these changes in over the last five years they have been in government, but instead they have degenerated the NHS beyond all recognition.' In the running: Nigel Farage enjoys a cup of tea outside the village hall in Cliffsend, Kent, as he continues his campaign in the constituency of South Thanet . Mr Cameron's speech was briefly interrupted by a heckle from the audience. Afterwards, Mike Howson told reporters that he had shouted: 'You have betrayed this country on immigration and Europe.' Mr Howson, from Leek, Staffordshire, explained he was a Tory party member but had voted for Ukip at the last general election and said he held Mr Cameron personally responsible for its rise because of 'a botched up in-out referendum'. He said: 'I think he (Cameron) is a fudged leader. He has not addressed the most important issue that this country faces which is immigration and the relationship with the EU. 'There is no hope of renegotiating free movement of people. We need to control our own borders. We need to leave the EU.'","PM accuses Miliband of leading a 'bunch or hypocritical, holier-than-thou, hopeless, sneering socialists'

"It was a case of ‘The Young Man And The Sea’ after a massive swordfish was caught by a 16-year-old boy in Tasmania that weighed over three times his bodyweight and which took him six hours to get into the boat. The amazing feat was pulled off by teenage fisherman Kyle Longmore - who weighs just 70kg - when he caught the record-breaking 263.5kg broad-bill swordfish about 35km off Tasmania’s East Coast. What made the effort even more incredible was that the teenager caught the 263.5kg fish using just 24kg fishing line. It was for this reason it took him so long to reel the huge fish in as he was afraid the line would snap. Scroll down for video . We're going to need a bigger boat: (From left to right) Leo Miller, Kyle Longmore and Simon Turner celebrate the impressive catch . 'I hooked the fish at 10.45am and we finally landed it in the boat at 4.45pm. I was pretty exhausted by then but once the fish was in the boat I just felt massive relief,' Kyle told Daily Mail Australia . 'Then there was a huge amount of excitement. Lots of screaming and celebrating after that, and a team hug. It’s something I’m very proud of.' It's believed to be the biggest swordfish ever hooked in Australian waters by amateurs. It beat the current Australian heaviest record catch for using only a 24kg line by 156 kilos, and beat the Australian all-tackle record by 88kg. It took Kyle (left) six hours to get the giant 263.5kg broad-bill swordfish into the boat . Kyle kept the fish and divided it up amongst his mates who helped him to eat it. Normally he uses the 'tag and release' method when he catches fish, but made an exception this time as it was so big and he was going to eat it with his friends. Apart from fishing Kyle’s in his first year doing a school-based apprenticeship as an automotive mechanic. 'I’ve been fishing all my life. It took a lot of concentration – a lot of mental and physical work. I just had to stay focused and not give up. After all that you have to hope you can land it,' Kyle says. ‘The worst moment was when it got closer to the boat. It’s when things can go start to go wrong and people start to panic. There’s always a lot more pressure as the fish gets closer to the boat.' Kyle battled with the huge fish despite feeling mentally and physically exhausted . Kyle was onboard his friend Leo Miler’s 7m boat ChoonaChasa while competing in the Coles Bay Classic fishing competition last Saturday when he made his memorable catch. Leo explained that Kyle had to stay patient and not rush into making any mistakes. 'I mean the last three hours of the fight the fish was only 50 metres from the boat swimming around. Kyle just had to be careful because the line was so much lighter than the weight of the fish,' Leo told Daily Mail Australia. The 16-year-old was able to catch the massive swordfish using only 24kg fishing line . 'It jumped about 23 times to try and get rid of the hook, but we still weren’t sure how big it was. It was only when we got it onto the boat that we realised the size of it. 'Kyle was really physically and mentally finished by the end. He really had to concentrate the whole time and not stop for a moment. 'He did tremendously well for a boy of his age to land this kind of a fish. He’s obviously a naturally talented fisherman.'

"Rescue centers are struggling to cope with a mystery surge in the numbers of starving sea lion pups which have washed up on Californian shores since January. More than 1,100 starving and sick pups have been rescued from California's beaches, as well as public bathrooms, behind buildings and along railroad tracks since the beginning of the year. The number is almost five times higher than the 250 pups which would usually be expected in the key monitoring period between January and April - and no one knows why. Scroll down for video . Crisis: More than 1,100 sick or starving sea lion pups have washed up on Californian shores this year . Surge: Rescuers usually only expect to see about 250 in the same period, and so volunteers like BrennanSlavik (pictured) have been helping save the pups, like this one on Laguna Beach . Rescue: At SeaWorld, in San Diego, the sea lion show has been suspended and two temporary pools have been dedicated to housing pups like this one, in the hope they can be saved . It's not unusual to have some sea lions wash up each spring as the pups leave their mothers, but Keith A. Matassa, executive director at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, said they started getting calls in December. His center, in Laguna Beach, is currently rehabilitating 115 sea lion pups. On a recent day, over the course of two hours, five suffering animals came in. One was brought in by a police officer, three more came in with an animal control team and the fifth was called in by a couple walking along beach. The last pup, at almost a year old, weighed just 23 pounds - a third of what it should have. It was so ill, staff had no choice but to put it down. Matassa explained pups that should be gaining 20 to 40 pounds in a two-month period have put on just two pounds. 'These animals are coming in really desperate. They're at the end of life. They're in a crisis ... and not all animals are going to make it,' he said. Feeding: Once rescued, pups who are healthy enough to be saved are fed formula to help them put on weight . Volunteer: Brennan Slavik carries a just-rescued sea lion pup into a holding pen after feeding it . Surgery: Dr Todd Schmitt, center, and veterinarian technician Jen Rego, right, prepare an injured sea lion for eye surgery at SeaWorld's Animal Rescue Center, in San Diego . An hour down the coast, the situation is so bad that SeaWorld, in San Diego, suspended its sea lion show so it can focus on rescue efforts. The theme park has treated 400 pups - more than twice the number it would care for in a typical year - and constructed two temporary pools to house them. Scientists aren't sure what's causing the crisis, but suspect that warmer waters from this winter's mild El Nino weather pattern are impacting the sea lion birthing grounds along the Channel Islands off the Southern California coast. The warm water is likely pushing prime sea lion foods - market squid, sardines and anchovies - further north, forcing the mothers to abandon their pups for up to eight days at a time in search of sustenance. Dying: A starving pup, weighing a third of what it should have done, looks out from a playpen at the Pacific Mammal Center. It later had to be put down, so weak it could not be saved . Stronger: Once pups get stronger, they graduate from formula to whole fish, and are playfully called 'feeders' while those that can once more compete for fish tossed into a pool are called 'fighters.' Washed up: Pups have been found in public washrooms, behind buildings and on railway tracks . The pups, scientists believe, are weaning themselves early out of desperation and setting out on their own despite being underweight and ill-prepared to hunt. 'They're leaving with a very low tank of gas and when they get over here, they're showing up on the beach basically ... starving to death,' said Justin Viezbicke, a coordinator with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's California Stranding Network. For rescue centers like Pacific Marine Mammal, that translates into round-the-clock, back-breaking work for dozens of volunteers who've arrived from all over the U.S. to help. The center in one of Southern California's premiere beach communities has rescued more than 213 pups since the beginning of the year and has treated ones that weighed as little as 14 pounds at eight-months-old. Volunteers have been arriving from all over the U.S. to help with the escalating crisis. Crates holding animals awaiting assessment are crammed into every corner, including the laundry room, as those already housed in communal pens barked and bleated in a deafening racket as mealtime approached. Warming: The surge could be down to rising sea temperatures, pushing the sea lion's normal food north . Listed: The names of the rescued sea lion pups at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center . Overwhelmed: The Pacific Marine Mammal Center currently has 115 sea lion pups - far more than usual . Release: They hope to get them healthy enough to set free, tracking some to monitor their progress . Each incoming pup has its temperature taken and is weighed, measured and given a blood sugar test before the team decides if they can save it. Most of them are so weak they barely resist. Those that make the cut are tube-fed a gruel of pureed herring, Pedialyte, vitamins and milk three or four times a day after starting out with a simple broth of hydrating fluids and dextrose. Those that graduate to whole fish are playfully called 'feeders' and those that can once more compete for fish tossed into a pool are called 'fighters.' The goal is to get the pups strong enough to swim free again - but the volunteers who nurse them back to health may never know if they make it in the wild. Only a handful will be fitted with expensive tracking devices. The rest are tagged with a number and fall off the radar unless they are rescued again. 'The tricky part is we're putting them back into the same environment that they just came from. And that's going to be a challenge for them,' Viezbicke said.","More than 1,100 starving or sick sea lion pups rescued  since January .

"President Obama told Prince Charles that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting at the White House this afternoon. As the pair sat in the Oval Office in front of the ornate fireplace, Obama told Prince Charles: 'I think it's fair to say that the American people are quite fond of the Royal Family.' When the 66-year-old said that news was 'awfully nice to know,' Obama added, 'They like them much better than they like their own politicians.' Scroll down for video . President Obama joked this afternoon that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting with Prince Charles at the White House . The pair met in the Oval Office for the second time since Obama took office. Vice President Joe Biden was also present . A slightly awkward Prince Charles responded, 'I don't believe that,' before pausing and then quickly moving the topic on to his visit the previous day to Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington. The two men last talked face to face almost four years ago when Charles flew to America a few days after the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. This time he was joined by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Vice President Joe Biden made an appearance. The Prince and the President sat together while Camilla and Mr Biden sat nearby, opposite each other on sofas. Obama is the sixth American president to entertain the Royal, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last . The pair shook hands and smiled broadly for the cameras as Camilla sat nearby on a sofa - she wore a pale gold coat . US President Barack Obama watches as US Vice President Joe Biden reacts to microphone booms moving nearer him . The press pool clamor round to pick up the president's comments . The pair were in good spirits and were both smiling widely during the meeting . Dozens of photographers, journalists and cameramen had been allowed into the room and the Prince looked around as camera shutters went off and boom microphones were pushed towards them. Charles looked a little bemused but he pointed out one of the British press corps out to the President - a veteran royal photograher from the British tabloid newspaper, the Sun. He told Mr Obama he had been photographing the Prince for more than 35 years and when he added that the first president he had reported on in the US was Ronald Reagan, the American leader replied 'Awesome'. In December, Prince William, who is second in like to the British throne, was invited to the White House by President Barack Obama . Obama is the sixth American president to entertain the Royal, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last. Earlier in the day the Prince of Wales paid a visit to the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington D.C to meet veterans. His wife Camilla looked on admiringly as Charles tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself. The couple had begun their day by visiting President Abraham Lincoln's cottage and were met by Erin Carlson Mast who is in charge of maintaining the property. Mrs Mast also had presents to dispense: a book entitled Lincoln's Sanctuary for Charles and another called What Do You Do With An Idea for his grandson, Prince George. Afterwards, the royal couple were ushered to the Armed Forces Retirement Home and were whisked into the Scott Building which houses many of the residents. Britain's Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, are directed to the West Wing doors of the White House in Washington DC . The Royal couple walk up the steps to the West Wing of the White House . Outside the White House an animal rights activist wore a a goose costume to thank Prince Charles y for his opposition to foie gras. Along with a visit to the bowling alley, the royal couple were also shown the library, which boasts stunning views of the Washington Monument, and the wellness facilities for the pensioners who live there. Outside the White House an animal rights activist wore a a goose costume to thank Prince Charles y for his opposition to foie gras. 'Charlie is my darling for banning foie gras from royal menus,' read a placard held up by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals activist. PETA labels as cruel the force-feeding of ducks and geese required to produce the liver delicacy. 'We wanted to thank him for his kindness and for setting a good example,' the activist, Ashley Byrne, told AFP. In 2008, Prince Charles said he had ordered his personal chefs to stop buying foie gras.","The pair met in the Oval Office for the second time since Obama took office .

"A Turkish Airlines flight has been forced into an emergency landing after a note with the word 'bomb' was reportedly found in the toilet. The flight from Istanbul scheduled for Sao Paulo, Brazil touched down in Casablanca, Morocco after declaring an emergency over North Africa. The airline confirmed the Boeing 777 with the flight number TK15 was carrying 256 people and made a diversion due to a 'bomb threat'. A Turkish Airlines flight has been forced into an emergency landing following a bomb scare . The action on board was reported by Istanbul-based journalist Erdem Arda Güneş . Istanbul-based journalist Erdem Arda Güneş claimed on Twitter that the diversion was due to a bomb scare after a note was discovered in the plane's toilet. The airline has not yet confirmed the bomb threat was made using a note in the toilet. However, Turkish Airlines said it is standard procedure to make an emergency landing if a threat is issued. The Boeing 777 was forced into a diversion and landed safely at Casablanca Airport . All fights in and out of Casablanca Airport were put on hold to allow the plane to land. The flight is reported to have landed safely at Casablanca and investigations are being carried out. MailOnline Travel has contacted Turkish Airlines for further comment and is awaiting a response. No further information was immediately available. It is the second incident in two days where a Turkish Airlines flight out of Istanbul has been the subject of a bomb threat. Yesterday flight TK-52 from Istanbul to Tokyo was forced to land at Ataturk Airport after the words 'C4-Cargo' were discovered written in the toilet. The words relate to the plastic explosive C-4. BGN News reported that the words were discovered by the cabin crew. They alerted the pilot who sent out a signal to make an emergency landing. After the passengers were evacuated after landing, a full sweep took place involving mobile technology, but no threat was discovered.","Plane scheduled for Sao Paulo, Brazil, diverted to Casablanca, Morocco .

"Australian Taxation Office (ATO) agents have been found to have engaged in 'conscious maladministration' that resulted in a $30 million tax bill that's now been quashed by the Federal Court. Documents were used subject to legal professional privilege in issuing the multimillion-dollar bill to an Australian businessman Garry John Donoghue. 'Garry, if you don't pay me and my family, I will have no hesitation in giving the ATO everything I have on you. You should be very worried,' his legal adviser Simeon Moore told Mr Donoghue before leaking his information to the Australian Taxation Office, the court heard. Australian Taxation Office (ATO) agents have been found to have engaged in 'conscious maladministration' The Tax Office told Fairfax Media it would be appealing the decision. The Age reports that Mr Donoghue, 58, a former Queenslander who is now living in London, ran a string of telecommunications businesses, including as the former managing director of listed mobile-services provider Plus SMS. He took the case to the Federal Court, arguing that Mr Moore, who was angry over alleged unpaid fees, passed on his file to the Tax Office. Federal Court Justice Logan found that the ATO assessment  was invalid because it was based on information under legal professional privilege, and the ATO had no right to use it. The ATO assessment was issued for tax years 2005 to 2007 and amounting to over $30 million when taking account interest and penalties. The ATO's decision resulted in a $30 million tax bill that's now been quashed by the Federal Court . Mr Moore, who at the time was not admitted as a legal practitioner but was a friend of Mr Donoghue's daughter, Alexandria, had issued Mr Donoghue with a bill for legal services amounting to $753,174. Mr Moore and Mr Donoghue's daughter, Alexandria were studying at Bond University in the Gold Coast together at the time. Justice Logan said this was 'outrageously extortionate' and a 'fantasy' amount given Mr Moore was an 'as-yet-not-admitted graduate undertaking post-graduate studies in law'. The Tax Office said that it would be appealing the decision . He said the decision by the ATO officer to later proceed and use the information could be attributed to 'inexperience and zeal, coupled with a lack of relevant supervision and guidance'. It had shown 'reckless disregard' of a right for Mr Donoghue to claim legal professional privilege. Justice Logan quashed the $30 million tax bill and also ordered that the Commissioner of Taxation pay Mr Donoghue's legal costs.","ATO agents have been found to have engaged in 'conscious maladministration'

"Passengers experienced tense moments on board a KLM flight today after a small fire erupted inside an overhead compartment for hand luggage. A spokesman for the Dutch airline said the cause of the fire is under investigation, but a passenger claims it was sparked by a lithium ion battery inside a traveller's bag. Flight attendants used an on-board fire extinguisher to put out the blaze which occurred moments after the plane landed in Bangkok at 10:40am local time. A KLM spokesman said the fire was detected as the plane taxied to its gate at Bangkok's international airport . The KLM spokesman said the Boeing 777, carrying 321 passengers plus employees, was taxiing to its gate at Suvarnabhumi Bangkok International Airport after flying in from Amsterdam. He told MailOnline Travel: ‘There was a short fire on board in one of the overhead luggage compartments for hand luggage and our crew made sure that the fire was put out. ‘After that all passengers and crew left the plane safely.’ The spokesman said he is unable to comment on the possibility that the fire involved a lithium ion battery, as the investigation hasn’t reached a conclusion. The KLM crew is being hailed for extinguishing the fire and preventing injury to passengers and employees . One of the plane's passengers tweeted a video which showed a crew member extinguishing the fire . One of the passengers on flight KL875 recorded video as a flight attendant used a fire extinguisher to spray a smouldering bag as it sat on a seat in business class. A photo snapped moments earlier shows the crew spraying the bag while it was on fire in the overhead luggage bin. The passenger posted the video and photo on her Twitter account, @Accone, and wrote: ‘Well done @KLM for calm management of cabin fire on flight KL875 caused by a battery in a passenger’s carry-on luggage’. She added in a second tweet: ‘Take Lithium ion batteries in carry on! One caused a fire on our flight. It was immediately detected & extinguished; difficult in cargo.’ KLM said it is unable to comment on claims that the fire was sparked by a passenger's lithium ion battery . The KLM crew is being hailed for extinguishing the fire and preventing injury to passengers and employees. The spokesman for the Dutch airline said the plane will be inspected and any necessary repairs will be completed before it returns to service. KLM’s policy on lithium ion batteries mirrors that of other carriers around the world. Loose lithium ion batteries may only be carried in hand baggage, and each spare battery must be stored in the original packaging, or the battery contact points must be covered with tape to insulate them and packed in separate plastic bags. It permits the transport of object that are powered by lithium batteries, including mobile phones, laptop computers and tablet computers. Last week Boeing and other aircraft makers urged a ban on bulk lithium battery shipments on passenger planes, saying the threat of fires is ‘an unacceptable risk’. An industry group warned that current fire suppression systems on planes cannot extinguish a blaze involving bulk shipments of lithium ion or lithium metal batteries.","A spokesman for KLM said the cause of the fire is under investigation .

"Scientists at Svalbard have successfully used instruments to observe the total solar eclipse - in the hope of solving one of the sun’s biggest mysteries. For some reason, the corona of the sun - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - is a lot hotter than the surface, and no one is sure why. But by observing the atmosphere of the sun around the eclipse, astronomers will be hoping to solve this mystery once and for all. Scroll down for video . A team of scientists travelled to Svalbard (pictured) to observe the solar eclipse. Using an array of instruments they studied the sun's corona, plasma around the sun that can only be seen during a total eclipse. They hope to work out why the corona is 300 times hotter than the surface . In a blog post, research student Nathalia Alzate from Aberystwyth University, who is part of the team conducting the research, said that everything had gone as planned. ‘What a show! Observatory doors open, special glasses ready, cameras, all of us standing in the cold, waiting for the moment of truth,’ she said. ‘Those two minutes of eclipse time brought us all here and connected us. Time to look at our data!’ A total solar eclipse is the only time that the entire atmosphere of the sun can be observed. Why is the sun’s corona - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - so much hotter than its surface? That is one of greatest solar mysteries, but astronomers will be hoping to find an answer today - by observing the total solar eclipse from the North Pole. The plasma of the sun is only visible during a total eclipse, so the scientists will use this unique opportunity to try and solve the puzzling phenomena. Some Nasa spacecraft have a ‘coronograph’ on board, which lets them block part of the sun and create an artificial eclipse, but the effect pales in comparison to viewing the atmosphere of the sun around the moon. At Svalbard, including fellow research student Joe Hutton from the university, measured radiation before, during and after the eclipse. They used a high-tech particle camera developed by the Cern@school programme to measure changes in radiation. Cern@school also provided similar detectors at schools across the UK, to measure changes in radiation from the eclipse at varying degrees of totality. In Svalbard, 100 per cent of the sun was covered by the moon, but much further south in London, only about 85 per cent was obscured. And in an amazing coincidence, the eclipse occurred over Svalbard in the North Pole on the same day the sun came into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years. The team at Svalbard (shown), led by Professor Shadia Habbal, Professor of Solar Physics at the University of Hawaii, included scientists from Aberystwyth University in Wales. They joined scientists from the US, Czech Republic and Germany as part of the 'Solar Wind Sherpas' In Svalbard, 100 per cent of the sun was covered by the moon (start of the eclipse shown), but much further south in London, only about 85 per cent was obscured . The scientists measured radiation before, during (shown) and after the eclipse. They used a high-tech particle camera developed by the Cern@school programme to measure changes in radiation . Shown is an image of 1999's solar elcipse from France, with the corona visible around the edges . The team of scientists worked at an old observatory on Svalbard, midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. They travelled to this region to ensure they saw totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse. For observers in other regions, such as the UK, less than 90 per cent of the sun was covered. The team at Svalbard, led by Professor Shadia Habbal, Professor of Solar Physics at the University of Hawaii, included the scientists from Aberystwyth University in Wales. They joined scientists from the US, Czech Republic and Germany as part of the 'Solar Wind Sherpas'. Up to 14 specially adapted cameras were used to photograph the sun in different frequencies during the eclipse, capturing images of the plasma from the corona. In so doing, they will hope to solve the sun’s greatest mystery. The temperature of the sun is known to be around 6,000°C (10,800°F), but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000°C (1,800,000°F), and even reaches 2,000,000°C (3,600,000°F) in some areas. This factor of 300 difference would be akin to the flame of a fire being 300 times colder than the air around it - but why this is occurring is unknown. One potential reason could be magnetic forces on the sun, with superheated gas creating a strong magnetic field and funnelling energy into the corona, but this has not yet been confirmed. The team of scientists worked at an old observatory on Svalbard, midway between continental Norway and the North Pole (shown with the red marker). They travelled to this region to ensure they saw totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse . Observations took place from the Kjell Henriksen Observatory Longyearbyen in Svalbard, pictured. In a coincidence, the eclipse occurred over the North Pole on the same day the sun came into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years . Data and images taken during the eclipse will be used to try and develop a mathematical model to understand this difference in temperature. 'The difference between the temperature of the sun and that of the sun’s corona is one of the great mysteries of astronomy,’ said Dr Huw Morgan, a Reader at the Solar System Physics Group at Aberystwyth University, who is overseeing the team’s work from the UK. ‘A total eclipse gives us an unique opportunity to measure the corona of the sun is so much detail and collect data that will enable us to better understand this difference.' He also added that studying the corona could help protect satellite-based communication systems from solar storms, which can be affected by coronal mass ejections - huge eruptions of material - from the sun. The temperature of the sun's surface (shown ion this Nasa image) is known to be around 6,000°C (10,800°F), but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000°C (1,800,000°F), and even reaches 2,000,000°C (3,600,000°F) in some areas, a factor of about 300 .","A team of scientists travelled to Svalbard to observe the solar eclipse using an array of instruments .

"Police officers in Sheffield have been photographed picking up a Chinese takeaway after parking their marked squad car at a bus stop. A pedestrian walking down Staniforth Road in the north of the city spotted the car blocking the bus stop late last week. One police officer remained in the car while their colleague went into the popular Silver Pan Chinese to collect their dinner. A police officer went into the Chinese restaurant while their colleague blocked a bus stop in Sheffield . The front wheels of the squad car were inside the bus stop for several minutes while the food was prepared . The officer returned to the squad car with the food before they departed the scene . According to one eyewitness the police car remained outside the takeaway for several minutes until the second over left carrying a carrier bag containing their food. The witness, who does not want to be named, told Mail Online: 'They were parked at the bus stop. I went up and asked them whether they were allowed to park there. It wasn't as if they were on an emergency call, or the takeaway was being robbed. 'They were in getting their dinner. I have no problems with police going to a takeaway, but they should obey the same rules as the rest of us.' The witness said the officers seemed quite annoyed when he approached. 'They did not like the fact that I was taking photographs. How can the police discipline the public if they do not obey the rules themselves. They could have easily found a designated parking space just a few yards away.' The police car was pictured outside the Silver Pan Chinese takeaway in Sheffield late last week . The witness said he has spotted a number of police cars apparently ignoring road traffic rules across the wider Sheffield area. 'If the police are dealing with a genuine emergency or need to park illegally for operational issues then that is fine. I don't think that we should hold the police to a higher standard than the rest of us. But if I parked on a yellow line or blocked a bus lane, I am sure the traffic warden would be writing a ticket within seconds.' South Yorkshire Police confirmed that they are looking into the matter. A spokesperson said: 'Without further information, we are unable to establish the exact reason why the officers pictured have stopped, as they could have been responding to operational incidents or making enquiries. This has been passed to supervisors to try and identify the officers involved. 'Where officers are dealing with a police incident they are allowed to contravene traffic regulations, nevertheless where no legitimate policing purpose exists we will always take disciplinary action against the officers involved.'","A police car was photographed parked at a Sheffield bus stop last week .

"Colorado police now say the death of an 18-year-old girl who was missing for over two months is 'suspicious' after her body was found stuffed in a suitcase in a remote park. However the death of Denver teen Kelly Mae Myrers, who went missing December 18 before being found on February 28 in Cactus Park, Mesa County, has not officially been ruled a homicide. Myers' body was put inside a suitcase and kept in a West Valley City hotel before it was transported to the Cactus Park area, a search warrant obtained by The Deseret News has revealed. Police are also investigating two persons of interest in connection with Myers' disappearance. Eduardo De La Cruz, 30, is being held on suspicion of trafficking heroin, however is not an official suspect in the Myers case, police say. Mystery: The death of Kelly Mae Myers, 18, has not officially been ruled a homicide, however police have two persons of interest in custody on an unrelated charge and have revealed her body was found in a suitcase . Persons of interest: Eduardo De La Cruz, 30 (left), is being held on suspicion of trafficking heroin, however police say he was staying at the same hotel where Kelly Mae Myers died. Raymond Cordova, 47 (right), an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house and allegedly dumped her body . Scene: The body of Kelly Mae Myers was found stuffed in a suitcase at Cactus Park in Mesa County, Colorado, on February 28, two months after police believe the teen died . De La Cruz was the alleged ringleader in a drug trafficking organization that supplied 'large quantities of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription narcotics'. He was named as a person of interest in the Myers case following a wiretap investigation. Myers was reported missing on December 18 by distraught relatives in Colorado who said her disappearance was 'out of character'. She was last seen in in Grand Junction with friends and was believed to be heading to Salt Lake City. Raymond Cordova, 47, an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house, the affidavit stated. Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19. An investigation traced her IP address to 3422 S. Decker Lake Drive in West Valley City, which is the Country Inn and Suites hotel. Investigators believe Myers died sometime on December 19. Her body was then placed in a black suitcase with a 'hard shell', an informant told police, according to The Deseret News. De La Cruz had checked into the same hotel as Myers on the day she is believed to have died,police say. The informant told investigators that he got into a car with Cordova and the suitcase. He said there was a 'foul odor coming from within'. Tragic: The remains of Kelly Mae Myers, 18, were found in a remote desert park of Colorado on Feb. 28 . They then drove to Cactus Park - a hotspot for four-wheel truck drivers performing stunts - where they disposed of the suitcase, the affidavit states. On February 23, detectives met with the head housekeeper of the Country Inn & Suites. She described 'smelling a very strong and pungent smell' coming from the room De La Cruz had rented in December. It was said as 'the smell as if someone did not wash their feet or socks for several months', the affidavit states. Myers' body was then located on February 28. The official cause of death has not been released. An autopsy has been completed. Cordova remained in the Mesa County Jail as of Tuesday for investigation of drug-related charges. Myers also had numerous alleged drug arrests related to methamphetamine. Police initially believed Myers had fled Colorado for Utah. Search: Myers went missing December 18, when family thought she had hitchhiked to friends in Utah . A search team was not sent out until January 19. Police also believed she may have tried to hitchhike to Salt Lake City. 'Investigators believe she has friends or known associates in the Salt Lake City area, and may have been trying to get there,' police said in a statement at the time. According to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, Myers worked at Abra Formal Wear and attended Central High School. A friend commented on her Facebook page: 'With a heavy heart I have to inform all my family and friends that they have found our sweet Kelly. Thank you to all who shared her information while she was missing. I only wish she had been found alive and well. We love you Kell Smell and I hope you sleep with the Angels and find peace.'","Kelly Mae Myers, 18, went missing from Colorado home on December 18 .

"Still a virgin: Zumreta Strsevic, 30, who was forced to get a report proving she had never had sex to quell vicious rumours about affairs at work . A Serbian woman asked doctors to vouch for her virginity after she was dogged by accusations of affairs with a former boss and other colleagues. Zumreta Strsevic, 30, chief accountant at the Cultural Centre in the western town of Prijepolje, said she was fed up with hearing rumours about her sex life come back to her. So she proved she didn't have one by commissioning a report from a gynaecologist which conclusively proved her virginity was still intact. It is now evidence in a claim against her workplace. 'It got so bad that it was becoming impossible to do the job properly,' she was quoted as saying by Central European News. 'So I decided the only way to prove I wasn't sleeping with other people I was supposedly having an affair with us to prove that actually I've never slept with anyone.' She told Serbian news website Blic that she realises the gynaecologist's findings means she will be subject to a new whispering campaign, but said she felt she had to do it to protect her honour. 'I don't care the price I'll pay to save face,' she said. 'I don't want to be drawn into their dirty games, and if they find any evidence of my alleged dishonest behaviour I'll leave work without saying anything.' Rumours about Miss Strsevic's sex life spread so far they were even brought up at a meeting of Prijepolje's Municipal Council, Blic reported. Miss Strsevic said the allegations were led by her current boss, who spread the rumours to colleagues. 'He accused me repeatedly over my alleged love affairs including one with a former director. When you make accusations like that, it sticks,' she said. Hard worker: Miss Strsevic says she suspects rumour-mongers wanted her to move to another job 'because they don't want me continuing to check what they are doing with public money' The career-focused bean counter, who had tackled financial irregularities at the Cultural Centre, said she had always focused on making a success of her business life before concentrating on her personal life. 'I don't know what they wanted to achieve with the rumours,' she said. 'Maybe they wanted me to move on to another job because they don't want me continuing to check what they are doing with public money. 'But at least now they know they can't get rid of me this way.'","A gynaecologist's report proves Zumreta Strsevic, 30, is still a virgin .

"France is inching closer to a ban on the use of skinny models, a trend which one leading MP has branded the 'glorification of anorexia'. Socialist politician Olivier Veran, who is also neurologist at the University Hospital of Grenoble, is demanding that fashion bosses who hire underweight girls be punished with six months in prison or fines of up to €75,000 (£60,000). He has proposed that models should be required to present medical certificates demonstrating a healthy body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing one's weight by the square of one's height. Scroll down for video . Unhealthy: Super-skinny models may be banned in France after a Socialist politician, Olivier Veran, has called for fines or prison sentences to be handed out to fashion bosses who employ them, and for all models to be forced to present a certificate of good health before being allowed on the catwalk . Mr Veran told French daily Le Parisien: 'It's intolerable to promote malnutrition and to commercially exploit people who are endangering their own health. 'A level of acceptable body mass index should be set and enforced. Websites encouraging young girls to lose weight should also be banned. 'Some of these sites tell pre-teenage girls they should have a gap of 15 centimetres between their thighs, or give tips on how to survive on as little food as possible.' There are now 40,000 people in France suffering from anorexia, around 90 percent of whom are adolescents, Mr Veran said. Measures similar to those proposed by Mr Veran are already in place in a number of countries in Europe and around the world. Spain bars models below a certain body mass index from featuring in the Madrid fashion shows; Italy insists on health certificates for models; and Brazil is considering demands to ban underage, underweight models from its catwalks. In Norway, MPs have proposed that images of airbrushed fashion models should come with a 'cigarette-packet' style health warning in a bid to tackle eating disorders. One suggested text for the warning reads: 'This advertisement has been altered and presents an inaccurate image of how this model really looks'. Medical experts around the world have warned against the dangers of ultra-skinny catwalk models and images airbrushed to make girls look thinner, which they say encourage anorexia in girls as young as six. Two years ago, fashion guru Giorgio Armani said that the fashion industry had a duty to 'work together against anorexia'. He added at the time: 'The industry has to recognise the link between its preference for abnormally thin models and the growth in eating disorders among young women.'","Socialist politician and neurologist Olivier Veran says the trend for super-skinny models 'glorifies anorexia'

"Almost a year after a blaze gutted the Glasgow School of Art's Mackintosh Building, the architects who will lead the painstaking restoration of the library have been announced. Page\Park Architects have been chosen from a shortlist of five firms who bid for the role earlier this month - and the design team will now begin working on a detailed plan for the restoration of the  library. And these stark pictures show the mammoth task they face to restore the much-loved building, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, to its former glory. The Glasgow-based architects were chosen thanks to their extensive track record in both restoring and reinvigorating major historic buildings - as well their work on buildings designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Work is expected to begin in the spring of next year and it is hoped that students will have access to a fully-restored building from 2017 or 2018. Scroll down for video . The architects who will lead the painstaking restoration of the Glasgow School of Art's Mackintosh Building have been announced . The century-old library at the Glasgow School of Art designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh was gutted in May last year . Glasgow-based Page\Park Architects have been chosen from a shortlist of five firms who bid for the role earlier this month . Professor Tom Inns, Director of The Glasgow School of Art, said the firm was chosen because of its work on Mackintosh-designed buildings . Professor Tom Inns, Director of The Glasgow School of Art, said: 'This is the beginning of an exciting journey of discovery. There will be many fascinating questions to be addressed as we undertake this complex restoration project. 'The team assembled by Page\Park Architects impressed us not only with their deep knowledge of the building, but of the wider work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. 'They also bring an understanding of the building's particular importance to Glasgow – its people and history - as well as of its status as an international design icon.' He added the firm has ongoing relationships with key crafts specialists and artists in Scotland and wider afield, and 'presented exciting proposals for expanding the legacy of the restoration by working with a new generation of creative talent'. Prof Toms added: 'We are looking forward to working in partnership with Page\Park Architects and the design team to explore how we can best meet the needs of the GSA in the 21st century whilst remaining true to Mackintosh's astonishing vision.' The blaze began on May 23 last year after flammable spray foam for a student artwork was sucked into projector fan and caught alight . The fire started in the basement, where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year art show . Firefighters in breathing apparatus stood shoulder to shoulder to forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections . Thousands of damaged pieces of building material have been marked in the hope that experts can put them back where they were before . David Page, Head of Architecture at Page\Park Architects, said: 'Page\Park Architects are delighted to have won the commission to lead a team to restore the world-renowned Charles Rennie Mackintosh Glasgow School of Art. 'We have, over many years, had the privilege to work on and in the context of the Mackintosh legacy, the highlight of which will now be the opportunity to bring The Glasgow School of Art into splendid re-use for its students and staff, the people of Glasgow and the huge audience beyond the city.' The company has worked across the spectrum of Mackintosh's designs from the domestic, including the School of Art itself and the former Glasgow Herald offices, which is now The Lighthouse. The Mackintosh Building was damaged last year after a blaze sparked when canned spray foam, which a student was using for an art project, drifted into a projector fan and caught alight. The building caught fire on May 23, starting in the basement, where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year art show. Blackened stones from the library's walls have been numbered with chalk. The building is considered by critics as Mackintosh's finest work . Firefighters were able to save irreplaceable paintings and furniture by Mackintosh after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found . A student had been using highly flammable canned spray foam to fill in the gaps in a piece which involved three large sheets of thick foam, which formed three 'walls' framing a fourth blank wall, onto which a digital projector was beaming images when the spraying took place. As the fumes from the spray foam spread around the room, they were sucked into the cooling fan of the projector and caught alight as they wafted over the heat of the circuit board. The fire engulfed the basement room and spread to destroy much of the iconic building's west wing. Witnesses described firefighters in breathing apparatus standing shoulder to shoulder, forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections of the art school in a bid to prevent the blaze from spreading. Other firefighters then darted in and out of the building to remove irreplaceable paintings and furniture by Mackintosh after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found.

No one was injured in the fire, but there was extensive damage to the Grade A-listed library, the equivalent of Grade I listed in England, which was described by critics as Glasgow-born architect Mackintosh's greatest work.

"A fundraiser for a pregnant widow whose husband was killed suddenly in a tragic snowmobile accident has earned more than $65,000 in the space of five days. Jeffrey Kinn, a 29-year-old metal worker from Greenville, New York, who didn't have life insurance, died last Thursday in a head-on collision between two snowmobiles, leaving his six-months pregnant wife Tyler, 23, without a father for their first child, a son. The GoFundMe campaign was launched by the couple's best friend, Kaitlin Bray, who told Times Union: 'Greene County is one of the poorest communities in New York State. There is not an abundance of wealth here. The fact that people are donating anything at all, and everything they can, is what small-town living is all about.' Tragedy: Jeffry Kin (left), a 29-year-old metal worker from Greenville, New York, died last Thursday in a head-on collision between two snowmobiles, leaving his six-months pregnant wife Tyler (right), 23, a widow . Kaitlin wrote of the campaign: 'My own pain is unbearable. None of us could even fathom Tyler's pain. Jeff would want to know that we will do anything to take care of his girl and we will.' The other snowmobiler, William VanAlstyne, 32, from nearby Hannacroix, survived the collision and is being treated for his injures at Albany Medical Center Hospital. Tyler, who married Jeff in September, is an administrative assistant and the younger sister of one of Jeff's high school friends. According to reports, Jeff met Tyler at a birthday party and told friends immediately that he would one day marry her. It took three years, however, for Jeff to persuade the object of his affection to date him, and another three years before they married. Flood of support: The campaign, which was set up by the couple's best friend, has raised more than $65,000 since it was launched on Saturday, two days after Jeff's fatal accident . Persistent: Tyler, who married Jeff in September (pictured), is an administrative assistant and the younger sister of one of Jeff's high school friends, who Jeff pursued for three years before she agreed to date him . 'Jeff was due to be a father in June 2015, and was looking forward to raising his son “the country way”,' his obituary reads. '[He] worked for his father Brian at Modern Metal Fabricators in Hannacroix for many years. Jeff and Brian were two peas in a pod and were the best of friends.' The funeral took place on Tuesday afternoon, and attracted long lines around the funeral home for four hours. Kaitlin, who launched the campaign on Saturday, two days after Jeff's fatal accident, wrote in the description: 'To say that Jeffrey Kinn was an amazing, funny, loving, give the shirt off your back kind of guy would be the ultimate understatement.' First-time mom: Donations made to Tyler will be used to help her financially support herself and her unborn son, who is due in June and will be named Wesson Roy . Grateful: Kaitlin Bray (pictured), who launched the fundraiser, said, 'Greene County is one of the poorest communities in New York State. The fact that people are donating everything they can is what small-town living is all about' She added, 'I know with every part of my being that Tyler will most likely kick my butt for doing this and say something like ""this is totally unnecessary"".... But truth be told, we feel helpless. So this my friend is our way of helping.' Donations flooded in for the cause - currently standing at more than $64,000 of the $80,000 goal, and the money, donated by 630 people so far, can be used by Tyler in any way she sees fit. 'Whether this allows Tyler to take the time off of work she needs to grieve this loss, or she stashes money away for a college fund, or finishes the construction projects that Jeff had been working on since he bought the house... this is our way,' Kaitlin states. A college fund has been set up at the National Bank of Coxsackie for the baby, who will be named Wesson Roy.","Jeffrey Kinn, a 29-year-old metal worker from Greenville, was killed in a head-on collision between two snowmobiles .

"A woman who soared to 19 stone after being bullied at school for having a gay mother has shed almost half of her body weight and is now looking for love. Christine Roberts, from Telford, Shropshire, began comforting eating after her parents split up and her mother announced that she was a lesbian. Weighing 19 stone at her heaviest, Miss Roberts was bullied because of her mother Sue’s sexuality. Scroll down for video . Christine Roberts used to be a size 26 but shed half her body weight and is now a svelte 10 stone . Christine's weight shot up to over 19 stone and she wore size 26 clothes . 'Kids at school said I was gay because she was,' said 23-year-old Miss Roberts, who is now eight stone lighter. 'I knew it wasn’t her fault, it’s just how she was. They would cyber-bully me using a fake profile of me to tell other girls from school that I was in love with them. It was really hard.' The bullying caused Miss Roberts to reach for the biscuits and by age 16, she was size 26. Aged six, Miss Roberts’ parents split and her and her sister, Lisa,  who is now 20, stayed with their mother, now 54. However, the Marks and Spencer supervisor said back then she did not understand what had happened. She said: 'We went and stayed with mum’s ‘friend’ then. But it was actually her girlfriend. 'It wasn’t until I was ten that I fully understood what was happening.' When children at school discovered her mother was a lesbian, Miss Roberts said bullies used it to pick on her and she found comfort in food. 'I’d eat three packets of biscuits in one go while I was doing my coursework - I just couldn’t stop,' said the 23-year-old. Christine Roberts is enjoying her new look after losing eight stone . Flashback: A young Christine was bullied at school over her mother's sexuality . 'Then I’d nip out and buy packets of sweets. 'At home I’d have huge portions at dinner and make out I hadn’t eaten all day.' By the time she was 16, Miss Roberts weighed more than 19 stone. 'It was a non-stop cycle. I’d eat because I was miserable, then feel guilty and eat more to try to feel better.' Miss Roberts would eat several packets of biscuits a day and regularly have takeaways with friends. She said: 'We’d get a Chinese or have a greasy pizza together. 'But they weren’t getting fat because they would only have two slices. 'I ate half the pizza by myself.' When Miss Roberts turned 18, she became even more self conscious. 'I’d organise nights out with friends then cancel because I felt so uncomfortable,' she said. 'On the rare times I did go out, I felt like I was getting funny looks. 'I wouldn’t go to the bar on my own. 'I’d just sit down all night. 'I’d had so many men shout out ""oi fatty"" in the street. I’d never been in a relationship and I never thought I’d find a man.' After getting a retail job in HMV that year, 2009, Miss Roberts lost two stone from being active at work. She said: 'I was walking around all day and it just happened naturally. It made me think I could change.' In September 2012, Miss Roberts and her sister decided to move hundreds of miles from their home in London to Telford, Shropshire. 'I decided it could be a brand new start in every way,' she said. Christine used to hate going out for an evening with friends (left) 'We moved in December so we decided for our New Year’s resolution we’d both get into shape. 'Although my sister was a healthy weight anyway, it really spurred me on.' So in January 2013, Miss Roberts joined up to the Dukan Diet. 'I’d seen it online while looking for different diets - people said the results were so quick,' she said. For the first ten days, Miss Roberts ate nothing but protein. She had two poached eggs for breakfast, Quorn chicken fillets for lunch and chicken breast with egg white for dinner. She said: 'I lost 13lbs in that first week and it felt amazing.' During the second phase, she could also eat non-starchy vegetables on alternate days. Christine said she is hoping that now she has lost weight, she will find true love . Christine said losing weight has made her feel confident about herself . After losing four stone in six weeks, Miss Roberts could reintroduce other foods but had to have a protein-only day once a week. Miss Roberts also burned calories by doing cardio at the gym three or four times a week, followed by a 30-minute swim. She is now 10st 7lbs, a size 12, and her confidence has soared. Miss Roberts said: 'This diet has been life-changing. 'I’ve changed my hair colour and have lots of new friends. Now I go out on a weekend and I’m first on the dancefloor, not sat in the dark corner anymore. 'I get chatted up at the bar and love it. I’ve been on plenty of dates and it’s great to know men find me attractive. You’ve got to love yourself before anyone else can love you. I hope I’ll find ""the one"" now. 'I’m never going back. It really is a lifestyle change.'","Christine Roberts was a size 26 and tipped the scales at 19 stone .

"Nigel Farage was today condemned as an attention seeker for calling for race discrimination laws to be scrapped and claiming some Muslims in Britain 'hate us and want to kill us'. The Ukip leader became embroiled in a race row after first suggesting in a TV interview that laws against discrimination should be scrapped, before trying to claim that he never discussed race at all. He claimed public concern was fuelled by migrant group who want to 'change who we are and what we are'. David Cameron said the remarks were 'deeply concerning' and Labour accused Mr Farage of wanting to go back to the days when firms put up signs saying 'no blacks, no dogs, no Irish'. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage says employers should be able to 'discriminate' over who them employ based on nationality, saying race hate is no longer an issue . IN THE C4 INTERVIEW: . Trevor Phillips: 'In Ukip land there would be no law against discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Would there be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour?' Nigel Farage: 'No. We are colour blind. We as a party are colour blind.' TODAY ON BBC RADIO 4 . Nigel Farage: 'I didn’t mention race at all – it was no part of that interview with Trevor Phillips at all.' In a Channel 4 documentary, Mr Farage claimed concern over preventing racial discrimination in employment 'would probably have been valid' 40 years ago and he would get rid of 'much of' existing legislation. He also described some Muslims in Britain as a 'fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us'. Setting out the case for scrapping race laws, Mr Farage said: 'I think the situation that we now have, where an employer is not allowed to choose between a British-born person and somebody from Poland, is a ludicrous state of affairs. 'I think that we have taken our relationship with Europe to a level that, frankly, has gone against common sense, and certainly against self-interest. 'I would argue that the law does need changing, and that if an employer wishes to choose, or you can use the word 'discriminate' if you want to, but wishes to choose to employ a British-born person, they should be allowed to do so. 'I think you should be able to choose on the basis of nationality, yes. I do.' He added: 'If we'd sat here 40 years ago, having this conversation, your point [on the need for anti-discrimination laws] would probably have been valid. I don't think it is today.' Prime Minister David Cameron used Twitter to issue a public condemnation of Mr Farage's comments . Labour leader Ed Miliband said the comments were 'wrong, dangerous and divisive' while Lib Dem Nick Clegg Clegg accused Mr Farage of 'instilling fear' Mr Farage was speaking in an interview with ex-equalities watchdog chief Trevor Phillips for a Channel 4 documentary, Things We Won't Say About Race That Are True, due to be broadcast next week. He claimed the rise of British-born Islamist extremists going to fight with ISIS in Syria had fuelled an 'uptick' in public concern. He added: 'I think perhaps one of the reasons the polls show an increasing level of concern is because people do see a fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us. So don't be surprised if there isn't a slight increase in people's worries and concerns. 'You know, when you've got British, when you've got people, born and bred in Cardiff, with British passports, going out to fight for Isil, don't be surprised if there isn't an uptick in concern. There has been an uptick in concern, but does it make us a prejudiced people? No.' 'There is an especial problem with some of the people who've come here and who are of the Muslim religion who don't want to become part of our culture. 'So there is no previous experience, in our history, of a migrant group that comes to Britain, that fundamentally wants to change who we are and what we are. That is, I think, above everything else, what people are really concerned about.' The remarks sparked a furious row, with political opponents accusing the Ukip leader of fuelling racial tensions. Mr Cameron said: 'Nigel Farage is attention seeking. The laws protect people from racial discrimination. It's deeply concerning he doesn't understand that.' Labour leader Ed Miliband said the comments were 'wrong, dangerous and divisive'. Mr Miliband added: 'I believe that Britain should be proud of the fact that we are a tolerant country, we're a country of different faiths, different backgrounds. 'I believe that the laws we have on equality are an incredibly important part of meeting the very British value of treating everyone the same whatever their religion.' Labour MP Sadiq Khan called the comments 'one of the most shocking things I have ever heard', suggesting Mr Farage wanted to take Britain back to the days when shops displayed signs reading 'no blacks, no Irish' Lib Dem Nick Clegg Clegg accused Mr Farage of 'instilling fear' by conflating problems like violent extremism and Sharia law with the issue of employment legislation. Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'This is one of the most shocking things I have ever heard from a mainstream politician and demonstrates breathtaking ignorance. 'When my parents moved to London they frequently saw signs saying 'No blacks, no dogs, no Irish': what Ukip is suggesting would take us back to those days.' A Ukip spokesperson said: 'We don't think there's anything controversial in what Nigel has said, at least not [for] the vast majority of the country.' Mr Farage later claimed his comments had been taken out of context. He said in a statement: 'My comments to Trevor Phillips were lauding the progress of race relations and equality in this country. Britain's media should be proud of this fact instead of trying to do it down. 'Ukip is the only party that is suggesting that Britain's employers should be free to employ British workers, regardless of creed or colour. It wasn't that long ago that the Labour Party called for 'British jobs for British workers'. 'And I suggest the real racists in our society are those who hear me say `British' and think `white'. I'm the only leader arguing for Britain's employers to favour British workers, no matter what their colour. 'And I must say, given the unemployment rates amongst young people , I'm now the only party leader standing up for them, black, white, or otherwise.'","Ukip leader said he would scrap 'much of' the existing employment laws .

"Timeshare fraudsters duped thousands of British victims out of more than £4million a year in a well-honed criminal operation smashed by Spanish police. Police chiefs today announced that they have arrested 56 people - all Brits, including the three alleged leaders - and uncovered 500 mostly pensioner victims. And they said they feared thousands more would now be identified following a series of Costa del Sol raids against the gang which had been operating for more than five years. Detectives detailed the lengths the fraudsters went to dupe victims into handing over cash at a press conference in Malaga this morning. The three-tier scam involved calls from fake lawyers and court officials who persuaded their victims to hand over up to £35,000 after being conned into selling their timeshares. Scroll down for video . Hotspot: The alleged ringleaders, who have not been named, are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the Costa del Sol (pictured) The chief alleged ringleader, a Brit living in the resort of Mijas, had three homes and a boat and drove two luxury cars he is thought to have bought with his ill-gotten gains. Nearly 80 bank accounts linked to the gang have been frozen and six vehicles seized along with the boat and properties valued at nearly £600,000. Lead investigator, Inspector Mercedes Perez Quesada, said: 'The fraud was three-fold. 'Telesales operators contacted potential victims and offered them attractive prices to sell their timeshare properties and took advantage of their ignorance of Spanish law once they'd been tempted to instruct them to pay things like administrative or public notary fees. 'Any excuse to get money out of them was valid. 'Once victims had been conned and knew they were never going to get their money back, a second group of people would call claiming to be lawyers saying they were going to launch a group action on behalf of victims and asking once again for money upfront. 'The third tier involved people posing as court officials ringing victims and saying cases had been resolved in their favour but they had to pay fees so they could obtain their cash settlements. 'The scam sounds very crude but we estimate the fraudsters were making between £35 and £35,000 from victims and the fraud was netting between £3.5 million and £4.5 million a year. 'The telesales operators were at the bottom rung of the fraud but knew exactly what was going on. 'The next level up were front men paid to open bank accounts so it made it more difficult to find out where the money had gone. 'They would receive commissions on the transfers of up to £360...Money collectors working for the three alleged ringleaders would collect up to £2,150 from each front man on a daily basis and pass it on to their paymasters. 'The leaders were the brains behind the operation and the final recipients of the money... They started the operation we have smashed in 2009. Concern: Police fear there may be thousands more victims may be identified following a series of raids on the Costa del Sol (pictured) against the gang which had been operating for more than five years . The alleged ringleaders, who have not been named, are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the Costa del Sol. Much of the money had been banked in offshore accounts. Two of the three alleged leaders were arrested along with 36 other suspects in raids in February during the first phase of the operation. The man police say is the ringleader was detained in a second phase after returning to Spain from the UK. A judge at a court in the Costa del Sol resort of Fuengirola is now coordinating an ongoing criminal investigation. He is probing 11 companies believed to have been set up to facilitate the fraud. Two men including the alleged ringleader have been remanded in jail after a closed court hearing and the remainder released on bail. None of the suspects have been formally charged as is customary under Spanish law, but are being probed on suspicion of money laundering, fraud and membership of a criminal gang. Inspector Perez said: 'We know so far this organisation defrauded 500 British victims out of money but we expect there are thousands of victims.' Police also admitted the alleged ringleader had been arrested before for similar offences. They were not able to say whether he had been convicted in court. Malaga police chief Pedro Garijo Torres said: 'We don't want to comment on things that escape our control. 'The important thing for us was the police operation which is of huge significance in an area like Malaga whose economy relies so heavily on tourism and foreign visitors.' Government spokesman for the area Jorge Hernandez Mollar described the police operation, involving financial crime specialists from Madrid and Malaga, as 'brilliant.'","Spanish police arrest 56 Britons following a series of Costa del Sol raids .

"Rush-hour commuters were left screaming and in tears today when a passenger fell under a London Underground train  - apparently after her coat became stuck in the doors. Firefighters, police and paramedics raced to Clapham South station in south London just after 8am when the 28-year-old woman fell from travellers described as an ‘overcrowded’ platform. She was taken to St George's Hospital with ‘non-life-threatening injuries’, but the incident led to huge queues for buses as Northern line services between Kennington and Morden were paralysed. Queues: Firefighters, police and paramedics raced to Clapham South station in south London just after 8am .

Pictured: The platform minutes after the woman fell . Very busy: Overcrowding at Brixton station in south London today following the accident at Clapham South . Witnesses told of fire crews hoisting up a Tube train to free the woman on the northbound platform, and claimed the woman was pulled underneath the train as it approached. One 13-year-old girl, who watched the incident unfold, said on Twitter: 'Her coat got stuck in the Tube doors, she was dragged across the platform. I saw it all. Thank God she survived.' NHS worker Jack Smith, 25, told the London Evening Standard: ‘I heard this prolonged scream from 20m (65ft) down the platform. There were loads of women around her screaming and pointing.' James Callen, a corporate services executive, added: ‘As the Tube pulled in people inevitably shuffled forward and the woman was pushed under the tube. 'There were horrendous screams coming from her and the people who were standing around her. We were ushered out pretty quickly and it was complete chaos. A lot of people were crying as well.’ Cristina Squires, Channel 5 News editor, said on Twitter that she saw firemen trying to rescue the woman, and claimed they had to 'jack up the train'. Emergency services on the scene: One witness told of how fire crews hoisting up a Tube train to free the woman, while another said the woman was pulled underneath the train as it approached . Waiting: Queues outside Balham station. Transport for London denied the incident was due to overcrowding . Sarah-Jane Peyton, a BBC EastEnders publicist, tweeted: 'Just been evacuated from a Tube at Clapham South after a poor woman was dragged underneath it. Horrible. Totally shaken up.' Transport for London denied the incident was due to overcrowding. But one commuter, who travels to west London daily from the station, said this issue is a major problem at Clapham South. He told MailOnline: ‘People are usually queuing back about ten people deep on the platform itself, and every train that arrives at the station is packed, so you have to squash on. ‘If you’re trying to board around 8.15am you’ll likely have to wait for five to ten trains in order to actually get on one, as barely one person can squeeze on at a time. ‘Sometimes the station gets so packed that they close access, because the platforms are so packed, and people have to queue outside until it is opened again.’ Ambulances and fire engines: One commuter, who travels to west London daily from the station, said overcrowding was a major problem at Clapham South . Totally shaken up': Sarah-Jane Peyton, a BBC EastEnders publicist, said the incident today was 'horrible' He added: ‘People push right up to the yellow line on the platform, so I’ve always thought there is a danger of falling onto the tracks if someone is just pushed slightly.' Software designer Ben Oakenfull said on Twitter: 'Someone under a train at Clapham South. Not a surprise really as the platform gets so overcrowded. Time for TfL to look at safety.' Nigel Holness, London Underground’s operations director, said: ‘Just before 8am this morning a passenger fell between the train and tracks at Clapham South station. ‘The passenger has been recovered by the emergency services with non-life-threatening injuries. There was no service from Morden to Kennington for around an hour, while the rest of the line had minor delays. The service has now resumed.’ He went on: 'The safety of customers and staff is our top priority and we do all we can to ensure customers can travel safely at all times. Thankfully incidents of this nature are extremely rare on our network and the Tube is one of the safest railways in the world. 'This follows heavy investment in safety improvements, and we are constantly seeking to further improve our excellent safety record.' British Transport Police said the incident was 'not being treated as suspicious' and an investigation had been launched. The London Fire Brigade said it sent two fire engines and a fire rescue unit, and helped recover the woman from the tracks. A spokesman said: 'Firefighters used a ""scoop stretcher"" - a specialist piece of equipment - to bring her back to the platform before she was taken to hospital.' An London Ambulance Service crew and air ambulance were also sent to the station, where the woman was treated before being taken to the hospital in Tooting. Her condition was not available.","Firefighters, police and paramedics rescue woman at Clapham South .

"Apple has revealed the world's thinnest laptop that experts say could pave the way for an 'iPad Mega' later this year. The new machine, called simply the MacBook, boasts a 12 inch screen and a full size keyboard - but is just 13.1 mm thin and weighs two pounds. It also boasts a radical new port, called USB-C, that allows it to use a single connector for power, and to hook up to other devices and even a TV. Scroll down for video . Apple has revealed  world's thinnest laptop that experts say could pave the way for an 'iPad Mega' this year . Measuring 13.1 mm at its thickest point, the new MacBook design is 24 per cent thinner than the 11-inch MacBook Air. It has a 12-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio, measuring 0.88 mm thin and a resolution of 2304 x 1440 . Its trackpad features built-in force sensors that allow you to click anywhere with haptic feedback. The design is the most compact logic board ever in a Mac, measuring 67 per cent smaller than the 11-inch MacBook Air. It is the first fanless Mac notebook for silent, efficient performance. MacBook also has several hours of wireless web browsing and up to 10 hours of iTunes movie playback. Experts say the machine blurs the line between the iPad, iPhone and Macbook range. 'It seems more iPad than Mac, and joins the two ranges together,' said Stuart Miles of Pocket-Lint.com. 'It is also easy to see where the rumours of the iPad Pro came in. It's very easy to see how this could be turned into a large iPad, with a removable keyboard.' Apple's Phil Schiller boasted the firm had 'reinvented every technology in it.' For instance, Apple has redesigned the keyboard. claiming it is four times more accurate. There is an LED under every key, so the entire keyboard has a uniform glow and can be used in the dark. There is a new, pressure-sensitive Force Touch trackpad too so users can fast forward a film by applying more pressure. The MacBook has the same 'taptic engine' as the Apple Watch, uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and is the first fanless logic board. This makes the components 67 per cent smaller. Ian Fogg, an analyst with IHS, told MailOnline 'What Apple is doing here is following its visa for the Mac, its adding in the best features form the iPhone and iPad, and making it thinner and lighter. 'They've also kept course on not putting a touchscreen in there, and innovation with the touchpad .

"A pair of stridently coloured slippers, so loud they should have come with earplugs, is proffered by a man in a flapping robe. ‘You want? You buy? Verigood, sir! Very, vairree cheap!’ I didn’t want, I replied, I wouldn’t buy. I shook my head and walked on quickly. However, in this part of the world, refusal to buy is interpreted as a cunning bargaining device. Obviously I must have wanted a colourful pair of slippers – and my speedy departure simply meant I was hoping to bring down the price. A vendor poses with a pair of slippers inside a casbah in Morocco (library photo) He hastened after me, slippers outstretched. ‘No, really,’ I insisted, ‘I actually already have a nice pair of slippers.’ But he wouldn’t be denied. ‘How much you pay, sir? Best price. You say.’ A circuit of Marrakech’s souks, the crowded warren of retailers in the medina to the north of the famous Djemaa El Fna Square, is an exhausting and sometimes worrying experience. If there is a Moroccan office of fair trading – unlikely, I’m guessing – its writ fails to extend to the souks, and don’t even think about going back for an M&S-style no-nonsense refund. The nearest soul-crushing British equivalent to the souks that I can think of is that moment of existential despair in Ikea where you lose your bearings in light fittings and begin to think that you may never find the road out. A circuit of Marrakech’s souks is an exhausting and sometimes worrying experience . Mind you, the mysteries of the souk have always been over-romanticised. ‘Come with me to the casbah and let’s make sweet music’ is generally supposed to be the killer line from the 1938 movie Algiers. In it, Charles Boyer plays jewel thief Pepe Le Moko, who uses the city’s market as a hiding place and becomes entranced by the ravishing beauty of co-star Hedy Lamarr. In fact the line is actually used by French cartoon skunk Pepe Le Pew in the later Looney Tunes send-up of Algiers. Where else but Hollywood could a cartoon skunk manage to prove more memorable than Charles Boyer? Yet it was the success of Algiers that inspired Warner Brothers four years later to make the Humphrey Bogart movie Casablanca, the first Hollywood film to weigh in against the Nazis (one supposes the big studios were hedging their bets on this). The Royal Palm resort is huge, with much of the 570 acres devoted to an 18-hole golf course . I went to Casablanca, Morocco’s largest city, about 15 years ago to see how closely the modern-day place resembled the movie version. Any similarity, of course, was purely coincidental as the 1942 film was shot wholly within the confines of the Burbank studio. During the film’s production, it was generally assumed that Casablanca would be a turkey. Despite the lengthy written introduction at the beginning of the film intended to offer some explanatory historical context, few American viewers had the remotest idea where Casablanca was and had little grasp of its complicated place in a sprawling global conflict. The film focuses on Ingrid Bergman’s attempts to get the necessary exit visas to fly to Lisbon with her husband. If this sounds daft, it’s because it was a made-up device to drive the plot. A VIP experience awaits passengers who fly into Marrakech and head to resorts such as the Royal Palm . Casablanca’s director was handed the script on a day-by-day basis. Nobody – not even the scriptwriters – were entirely certain what would happen in the end. The film struck a chord, however, and regularly tops the list of favourite movies. Some lines, such as ‘We’ll always have Paris’, are unforgettable. Some are execrable: Bogart’s Rick recalling with Bergman’s Ilsa the day the Nazis marched into the French capital: ‘The Germans wore grey. You wore blue.’ There is little in the real Casablanca to summon up Bogart and Bergman – it’s a pretty bleak port: think Tilbury with palm trees. It’s only when I visit Marrakech that I feel like crying: ‘Play it again, Sam!’ Here is to be discovered all the mystery of the casbah along with the exotic heat of the desert and the intriguing mingling of French and Arabic cultures – with the croissant set beside the tagine. If I had time, I’m sure I’d find Rick’s American Cafe with Sam at the piano still burbling: ‘You must remember this…’ While it would be curious to enjoy a holiday in Marrakech without being taken to the souk, these days the city centre has become something of an optional extra for a new breed of visitors. In the past five years, there has been a substantial building boom in the outer reaches of the city with the construction of several extremely plush stand-alone resort hotels which offer everything you need in one self-contained holiday place. The hotel has 135 suites and villas all built in a style that manages to combine the modern and traditional . That means you can now enjoy chic Marrakech breaks in cool top-end resort hotels – and your stay doesn’t necessarily have to involve a visit to the centre of the city, avoiding slipper-buying jaunts altogether if you prefer. Marrakech is now also one of those places that you can enjoy on a cunning fly-cheap, stay-posh basis. From the UK, there are now easyJet and Ryanair flights with return fares from about £100 (often substantially less expensive than competing flights to the Canary Islands, for example). And flying into Marrakech – unlike flying into Tenerife – passengers heading for resorts such as the Royal Palm, one of the newest and most impressive, have a bit of a red-carpet experience awaiting them. A VIP services man meets us off the plane and takes us straight to a private lounge, where we are served a mint tea as we complete passport formalities. We are then fast-tracked through immigration – pushed in front of a sizeable queue – and into the baggage hall. Outside, we are met by the hotel driver who takes our bags to a brand-new Land Rover Discovery for a 15-minute drive to the hotel, which lies about eight miles from the centre of Marrakech. The Royal Palm's imaginative kids’ club features models of lifesize sheep, all woolly and very cuddly . On the flight back, the reverse process is so well managed that we go from kerbside to aircraft seat in less than 15 minutes – I’d go back to Marrakech just for this unwonted delight. We were fortunate enough to arrive at the Royal Palm just after dark when the resort theatrically dresses up in exotic style. Driving up to the main hotel building is pure Hollywood, with blazing fire pits and walkways illuminated by dozens of hand-lit lanterns – not so much Bogart, more Indiana Jones. The Royal Palm resort is huge, with much of the 570 acres devoted to an 18-hole golf course lined with bougainvillea, laurel, roses and hibiscus shrubs – and shaded by some 4,000 olive trees, many hundreds of years old. If you’re worried about the wisdom of having a water-hungry golf course sitting on the edge of the Sahara, the resort is at pains to explain that it has been designed with the utmost care for water resources and local vegetation. Guests can choose from a traditional restaurant or the main restaurant which offers a mixture of cuisines . In the daylight, views extend well beyond the golf course across to the Atlas Mountains, which provide a wonderful, shimmering backdrop. At night, with clear skies, you sit under a canopy of the brightest stars, a sight it is impossible to grow tired of. While it sits on a large site, the hotel itself is not big, with 135 suites and villas all built in a style that manages to combine the modern and traditional. And, unexpectedly for a hotel of this sort, the Royal Palm is keen to attract families with even very young children. There is much to do here. The hotel has three pools, with the biggest one vast and stretching the length of the main building – a complex, connected expanse of water that spreads beneath bridges and around curves of the manicured gardens. There’s always a quiet place to swim and sunbathe. The spa has an indoor pool, and the fitness centre has a heated outdoor pool perfect for laps. Perhaps the real tour de force at the Royal Palm is the extraordinarily imaginative kids’ club which would not look out of place at a chic London members’ club and features – this is the best bit – models of lifesize sheep, all woolly and very cuddly. The spa at the Royal Palm has an indoor pool, and the fitness centre has a heated outdoor pool . There is traditional local costume for dressing up, arts and crafts, mini tennis courts, stargazing telescopes, and a special children’s pool. During the day you lunch next to the main pool. In the evening, you can choose from a traditional Moroccan restaurant offering mouth-watering local cuisine, or you can opt for the main restaurant which offers a mixture of cuisines.

Best of all are the rooms, which are all chic, stylish, luxurious and spacious. I was able to resist the urge to leave the hotel for a couple of days, but eventually had to answer the siren call of the casbah, where I had my encounter with the slipper-seller. As I climbed out of the taxi in Marrakech’s famously madcap main square, I found myself face to face with a baby goat. I had the perfect line ready. ‘Here’s looking at you, kid.’","Find an intriguing mingling of French and Arabic cultures in Marrakech .

"Single people may have a list of attributes they are looking for in a partner when they embark on the dating game, from that elusive ‘spark’ to a hot body. Now a new study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a long-term partner. Experts say that a sense of fun is more important to many people than whether someone has a degree or is religious. Play to win hearts: A new study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a partner (illustrated with a stock image) - just behind friendliness, intelligence and a sense of humour . Research  by the University of Zurich revealed that playfulness is important to both sexes – just behind friendliness, intelligence and a sense of humour. They also found that naturally playful people deem humour, a laid back attitude and creativity more important in partners than their more serious peers. They described playful adults as those having a love of wordplay who enjoy teasing, people who are spontaneous and will take on a challenge lightheartedly and those who play the fool, for example. While playfulness comes in many forms, little research has been conducted into the trait and how desirable it is to others. Study found playful people deem humour, a laid back attitude and creativity more important in partners than their more serious peers (stock image) The new study builds on the research of anthropologist Garry Chick from Pennsylvania State University, who developed a theory that playfulness in adults is a desirable trait in sexual selection. This is because it indicates to women, a low level of aggression in men and to men, vitality in the fairer sex. René Proyer and Lisa Wagner from the Department of Psychology at the University of Zurich, have shown that playfulness also plays an important role in the choice of a partner in the European culture. They asked 327 young adults from Germany, Switzerland and Austria to examine a list of 16 characteristics and indicate whether or not they found them desirable in a potential long-term partner. The results showed that men and women largely agreed in their orders of preference, although there were differences in individual ratings, according to the American Journal of Play. For example, women found a sense of humour more important than men and men found an exciting personality more important than women. Friendliness, intelligence, humour and a fun tendency came at the top of the list. Playfulness ranked mid-table, although not all that far behind the favourites. ‘Therefore, this personality trait also seems important for the choice of partner – at least more so that the partner having a degree, good genes or being religious,’ said Dr Proyer. They also found that participants who described themselves as playful also valued playfulness, humour, a laid-back attitude, a fun tendency and creativity among potential partners themselves. Study volunteers who were in relationships assessed themselves as more playful than those who were currently single. ‘Although we should be cautious while interpreting the data, this could be an indication that playful people are actually perceived as more attractive partners or that playfulness increasingly develops in the relationship,’ Dr Proyer added. Keeping your online dating profile humble is the key to success, researchers have revealed . Keeping your online dating profile humble is the key to success, researchers have revealed. They found that people who are looking for love online are less apt to trust a person with a flashy profile. Instead, they prefer a potential partner who appears not only successful, but humble and real as well. Andy High of the University of Iowa said: 'We found people want to contact a person who appears to be accurate in what they are saying about themselves online. 'It's tough when it comes to dating profiles because we want someone who seems like an amazing person, but we also hopefully will have a relationship with this individual, so we want them to exist.' The team found most people in their study were drawn to individuals whose profiles were positive but not over-the-top glowing. More importantly, participants preferred people whose online persona could be clearly traced to a real person. That means people want details, not broad generalities, especially about where a prospective love interest works and what he or she does for a living.","University of Zurich study revealed importance of playfulness in a partner .

"England’s fledgling wine industry is threatened by a group of devastating plant diseases discovered in the country for the first time. Experts at the Royal Horticultural Society in recent months have identified four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops. The diseases, spotted on vines at RHS gardens in Wisley, Surrey, and the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale. Kent, have damaged vineyards in wine-growing countries around the world. Outbreaks of the disease can result in reduced yields, delayed fruit ripening and overly-acidic grapes. The only way to properly deal with the problem is to pull up the plants, experts say. Experts at the Royal Horticultural Society  have identified four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops (file picture) The warning comes after wine producers announced this week that they are to apply for the name ‘Sussex wine’ to be given protected ‘designation of origin’ status, putting it in the same league as Champagne and Bordeaux. The reputation of English wine has grown immeasurably in recent years, particularly in warm and sunny Sussex, which has similar soil and climate to the Champagne region of France. Sales of sparking English wine are expected to hit £100million in 2015, following a boom in the number of vineyards in recent years. In 2014 alone 46 wine producers opened in southern England, a 50 per cent year-on-year increase in new firms. Vines are also becoming a popular plant in back gardens, with many homeowners trailing one over a trellis or up the inside of a conservatory. Dr Gerard Clover, head of plant health at the RHS, said there is no sign the viruses have yet made it into commercial vineyards, but warned producers to be wary of the disease. Writing in the trade journal the Grape Press, due to be published next month, he said: ‘The discovery of four grapevine viruses not previously reported in the UK during an in initial survey suggests there is no room for complacency. ‘These viruses have the potential to spread and cause damage to the UK’s developing grapevine industry.’ The four viruses cause different problems to plants, including leafroll disease, stem pitting, and fleck disease. Outbreaks of the disease can result in reduced yields, delayed fruit ripening and overly-acidic grapes (file picture) They are thought to have come to our shores on imports of infected plants, but can also be spread by mealybugs and scale insects. Dr Clover urged commercial vineyards to be aware of the risk and to only use plants that are certified as being virus-free. Speaking to the Daily Mail last night, he said: ‘We found four of these viruses in Wisley and one at Brogdale. But we found them because we knew what we were looking for. ‘The symptoms could easily be mistaken for something else - nutrient deficiencies for example, or other problems. ‘We visited two commercial sites in Suffolk and Surrey and found no signs of the viruses at either.’ But he said that until now there has been limited monitoring for viruses in British vineyards, so the diseases are likely to be i8n other sites as well. He added: ‘It is reasonable to suggest that they could have spread further, but it is impossible to say how far. ‘Luckily we have caught this early so we have opportunity to do something about it.’","RHS identify four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops .

"Convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, 60, has been hospitalized, but his lawyer says prison officials won't tell him why. Attorney Bret Grote with the Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center said Monday that his client is in the critical care unit of Schuylkill Medical Center in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Grote says neither he nor Abu-Jamal's brother, Keith Cook, have been allowed in to see him. 'We're concerned, about as concerned as it gets, about Mumia's health,' Grote told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Hospitalized: Convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal is in the critical care unit of a Pennsylvania hospital but his lawyers say officials won't tell them why . A Pennsylvania Department of Corrections official also declined to provide details. A spokesman for Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center says he had no information about Abu-Jamal. 'We never discuss an inmate's medical condition,' deputy press secretary Susan Bensinger told the Inquirer. Mumia's hospitalization was revealed Monday when a group of his friends arrived to the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy for a visit and were informed by prison staff that he wasn't there. While Grote and others had permission with the prison to visit Mumia, the hospital had not yet cleared them. Grote said he hoped the matter would be cleared up by Tuesday. Abu-Jamal is a former Black Panther serving life in prison for the 1981 murder of white Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner. Treated: Lawyers with Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center say prison officials told them their client is being treated at Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Mumia's death sentence was overturned in 2012. Abu-Jamal supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show and even has a street named after him in France.

He joined the NYPD in 1973 - and had not taken one sick day (pictured left in the 1980s) He added: 'He was also the person I went to whenever I was stumped on a case because he had seen and done it all so many times. He always knew the answer.' Murnane worked on nearly every major case in the last 20 years, including the 2011 killing of Brooklyn Officer Peter Figoski and the fatal stabbing of a six-year-old boy in an elevator last summer in east New York. 'If you are the bad guy, the worst of the worst ... Buddy Murnane has been part of the team looking for you to bring you to justice,' then-Councilman James Oddo said at a 2010 City Hall ceremony, according to the Staten Island Advance. 'He has truly put community, city and country above all.' His wake is being held on Wednesday at the Colonial Funeral Home. His funeral is Thursday. He would have reached mandatory retirement age on April 30, his 63rd birthday. The highly regarded sergeant joined the New York City Housing Police Department on September 17, 1973. He served most recently in the Detective Bureau’s Major Case Squad. He was promoted to Detective in December 1981 and to Sergeant Detective Supervisor in June 1995. A Police Combat Cross recipient, Sergeant Murnane, affectionately know to his friends as Buddy, was also honored 13 times for Excellent Police Duty and five times for Meritorious Police Duty. He is survived by his wife Linda, son Robert, daughter Kim and four granddaughters – Emily, Kaitlyn, Allison and Riley Frances.

"Mother of two Sally Adey was killed in the terror attack on the Bardo National Museum in Tunis, dying off wounds to her stomach and pelvis . A retired British solicitor who was killed in a terror attack on a museum in Tunisia died from wounds to her stomach and pelvis, an inquest heard. Mother-of-two Sally Adey, of Caynstall, near Shifnal, Shropshire, is one of more than 20 people who died after gunmen attacked tourists at the Bardo National Museum in Tunis. The terror attack was the worst of its kind in Tunisia for 13 years. Mrs Adey  had been on a Mediterranean cruise with her 52-year-old husband Robert, who survived the attack and had to identify his wife's body. Gunmen started shooting people after they were able to sneak into the museum on March 18, killing more than 20 people - including 17 tourists who had been on the cruise. Two gunmen who carried out the atrocity were subsequently killed in a firefight with security forces. On Sunday the Tunisian government confirmed that terror chief Khaled Chaieb, also known as Abou Sakhr Lokman, was killed overnight in an operation in the Gafsa region near the Algerian border. He was one of the country's most dangerous terrorists and is believed to have been involved in the museum shooting. Coroner's officer Julie Hartridge, of Shrewsbury Coroners' Court, said retired solicitor Mrs Adey and her husband had left the luxury cruise ship MSC Splendour earlier that day before going into the museum on an excursion. She said a postmortem carried out on May 25 had established provisional cause of death as 'consistent with gunshot wounds to the abdomen and pelvis'. Scroll down for video . Mr and Mrs Adey married in 1984 and have two children, Molly, 20, and Harry, 23. Mrs Adey is believed to have retired to have helped her children study for their A Levels and is thought to have recently returned to work full time. After the attack ISIS based in Iraq and Syria claimed responsibility. Tunisian fighters make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to ISIS in Syria, with as many as 10,000 having signed up. Mrs Adey (centre) was on a luxury cruise with her husband (right) when they went into the museum on a trip . Mr and Mrs Adey, a solicitor, had been married around 30 years and the couple have two children . Mrs Adey is believed to have retired to help her children with their A Levels and recently began working again . CCTV footage of the shooting shows the gunmen roaming free around the museum carrying assault rifles and bags. At one point, they encounter another man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs. They briefly acknowledge each other and let the unidentified man walk free before unleashing the deadly attack in the country's largest museum. The video also shows stills of the dead gunmen - named as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaou - who were killed in a firefight with security forces, including a picture indicating at least one was wearing an explosive belt. Images released after the shooting show glass perforated with bullet holes and grenades discarded on the floor. A window of the museum is filled with bullet holes after the shootout claimed the lives of 23 people . The lack of security at the country's largest museum has since been called into question and the brutality has led to large scale solidarity protests in Tunis, both at the weekend and in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Several people were arrested by Tunisian security forces after the attacks. The government now plans to deploy the army to major cities to bolster security following the shootings . On Saturday French President Francois Hollande confirmed Huguette Dupeu had died from her injuries following the attack.","Sally Adey was on a cruise with her husband and visited Bardo museum .

"This is the terrifying moment a teenage girl is almost crushed to death as a car hurtles through the front of a pizza store. A surveillance camera caught the near-fatal incident happening at Pudge Brothers Pizza in Aurora, Colorado, around 5pm on Wednesday. Footage shows the unidentified 15-year-old being driven through the front of the restaurant as a vehicle rams her from behind. She is suddenly showered with shards of glass as the window breaks before her. Furniture from  the eatery is upturned and pushed forwards. Miraculously the girl appears to be okay as she gets up from the bonnet and walks away. A passer-by stops at the front door to check out the situation. The sedan then appears to start backing up. Police told CBS News that the driver accidentally took her foot off the break, which caused her to speed forwards out of control.

"A former soldier who claimed to have fought off a Vietnamese gang, like karate super-hero Bruce Lee, has failed to win his claim for post-traumatic stress disorder after a judge ruled that his tales were 'totally incredulous'. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal were told of the night Norman Olsen had been at a bar in Hong Kong, when he became involved in a fight with a gang of 12 armed with weapons in the 1970s. The Queenslander said he was able to take on each of the 'crazed lunatics... screaming and yelling' at him as they came with batons that had spiked two-inch balls attached to the ends. He detailed how he was able to escape with an injury to his elbow. Mr Olsen argued that such events left him with post-traumatic stress disorder and took the matter to the AAT for an appeal after it was initially rejected. Norman Olsen, a former soldier, who claimed to have fought off a dozen attackers like karate super-hero Bruce Lee (pictured) has failed to win his claim for post-traumatic stress disorder, after a judge ruled that his tales were 'totally incredulous' 'In relation to the Hong Kong Bar incident, The account Mr Olsen gave conjured up images of a scene out of a Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee (pictured) movie, Mr Olsen playing the role of the super hero,' tribunal member Marella Denovan said on March 4 . Tribunal member Marella Denovan was not reasonably satisfied  and consequently knocked back with Mr Olsen's claims on March 4. 'In relation to the Hong Kong Bar incident, the account Mr Olsen gave conjured up images of a scene out of a Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee movie, Mr Olsen playing the role of the super hero,' Dr Denovan said. 'It is totally incredulous.' A number of psychiatrists gave evidence, as Dr Denovan concluded Dr Bradley Ng's to be the most reliable. Dr Ng questioned the legitimacy of the accounts of events provided by Mr Olsen, saying that the former soldier talks quite boastfully about punching and assaulting people while claiming to have been in fear in Vietnam. Dr Ng further opined that there is a high chance that Mr Olsen has an antisocial personality disorder, saying he 'fails to conform to social norms at times, and has gross impulsivity and marked irritability and aggressiveness'. The psychiatrist then stated that 'people with antisocial personality disorder tend to deceive and distort accounts'. Dr Denovan said there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in Mr Olsen's claims, which the digger acknowledged and attributed his earlier accounts of the incidents to his illness. But Dr Denovan handed down the decision that Mr Olsen was 'an unreliable witness'. 'I have concluded that Mr Olsen has a sincere belief that his psychiatric illness/s are due to his experiences in Vietnam, however he is an unreliable witness, and he was not exposed to the events the diagnosis of PTSD relies upon,' Dr Denovan said. 'I therefore find that on balance, Mr Olsen suffers from generalised anxiety disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and alcohol misuse.'","Norman Olsen detailed the night he been at a bar in Hong Kong in the 1970s .

"Jason Harrison was shot dead by Dallas police officers last June . A body-camera video of the June 2014 police shooting of a mentally ill Dallas man has been released, showing the chilling moments that led to the man's death. The family of Jason Harrison, a 39-year-old man who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, released the graphic video Monday to show the public how the police handled the mentally ill man. . The video clip, the first body-camera footage released of an officer-involved shooting in Dallas, WFAA reports, shows two officers responding to an Oak Cliff home on June 14, 2014. Harrison's mother answered the door after contacting police for help with her son. Family members told WFAA that it was not the first time police were called to help control the man. However, what happened next was far from what anyone expected. The body-camera footage shows Harrison's mother stepping away from the home as she told the police, Officers John Rodgers and Andrew Hutchins, that Harrison was 'bi-polar and schizo' and 'off the chain.' The 38-year-old is seen standing in the doorway twirling a screwdriver in his hands. The officers, noticing the potential weapon, yell for the man to drop it as his mother is heard in the background screaming 'Jay! Jay!' Harrison appears to take a step away from the doorway and the two officers immediately fire at the man. In the video, a stun gun is seen in one of the officer's holsters but was never used to control Harrison. Harrison stumbles toward the garage, covered in blood, and falls as his mother is heard yelling 'You killed my child!' The officers reportedly shot the man five times. 'It was the most heartbreaking experience in my life,' Harrison's mother, Shirley, told NBC. 'To stand there helpless, he's helpless. I couldn't help him. To be gunned down right before my eyes.' In October, Harrison's family filed a wrongful death and violation of civil rights lawsuit against the officers, arguing that Harrison, who the family says was not a violent person, posed no threat to the cops, NBC reports. Screwdriver: The 38-year-old is seen standing in the doorway twirling a screwdriver in his hands (photographed), the officers notice the potential weapon and yell for the man to drop it . Step: Harrison is seen here taking a step away from the door, officers immediately draw their weapons and shoot the man several times . Stumbles: Harrison stumbles toward the garage, covered in blood, and falls as his mother is heard yelling 'You killed my child!' However, the officer's attorney, Chris Livingston, says the men feared for their lives, The Dallas Morning News reports. Livingston said that killing someone with a screwdriver would be 'pretty easy. It'll only take one blow.' Police say that the video confirms the officer's claims of self-defense. Police note that the situation unfolded quickly in a small space and the officers were protecting themselves, the Morning News reports. 'The officer has literally less than about three seconds to react to this situation,' Keith Wenzel, a tactical trainer for law enforcement agencies, told WFAA. Harrison's family obtained the video from the department as part of the lawsuit. And both Harrison's family and their attorney, Geoff Henley, said the video should spark reforms on how police interact with the mentally ill, the Morning News reports. 'When you're dealing with somebody who is mentally ill, you're not supposed to agitate,' Henley told the station. 'You're not supposed to move fast... you're not supposed to inflame.' Heartbreaking: Harrison's mother, Shirley (photographed), described the incident as 'the most heartbreaking experience in my life' Duty: The two officers, John Rodgers (photographed) and Andrew Hutchins are back on duty with the Dallas Police Department . Criticism: The police department has received criticism on its Facebook page, since the video was released, from those who believe the man was wrongly killed . 'Hello, ma'am:' Here, one Facebook user described the officers as 'serial killers with badges' Respect: As the department's page has been riddled with critical comments, some are calling for people to 'respect our police officers' Wenzel told WFAA that the officers were too close to Harrison to use a stun gun. He said that if the officers moved back, creating enough space to use the stun gun, the suspect could have attacked his mother. '...well people would say the officer should have stood between the mother and the son -- which is what he did.' The police department has received criticism on its Facebook page, since the video was released, from those who believe the man was wrongly killed . Dallas police have completed their investigation into the incident and the case has been turned over to the district attorney's office. The case has not been heard by a grand jury yet, and both officers are back on duty.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Much of the start of the world's most famous sled dog race is covered in barren gravel, forcing Iditarod organizers to move the start further north where there is snow and ice. A weather pattern that buried the eastern U.S. in snow has left Alaska fairly warm and relatively snow-free this winter, especially south of the Alaska Range. 'If I have one more person say to me to move the Iditarod to Boston, I'm going to shake my head,' said race director Mark Nordman. Scroll down for video . In this photo taken on Thursday, there are bare patches of grass and mud on sled dog trails in Anchorage, Alaska which is unsuitable for the Iditarod . The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race starts Saturday with a ceremonial run through Anchorage. But the official start two days later has been moved 225 miles (360 kilometers) north, over the Alaska Range, to Fairbanks to avoid the area that left many mushers bruised and bloodied last year. Iditarod officials said the conditions are worse this year. The race's chief executive officer, Stan Hooley, called the conditions 'pretty miserable.' And last year was no picnic. One musher last year was taken out by a rescue helicopter after making it through the Dalzell Gorge only to hit his head on a tree stump in the Farewell Burn. Knocked unconscious for at least an hour, Scott Janssen got back on the trail after waking up. But shortly after, he broke his ankle while walking on ice trying to corral a loose dog. Mush!: Aliy Zirkle's team runs across Willow Lake during the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Willow Lake, Alaska last year when the terrain was snowy enough . 'As an outdoorsman, to have to be rescued from the trail isn't a wonderful thing,' Janssen said. This year's race will feature 78 mushers, including six former champions and 20 rookies. The winner is expected in Nome in about 10 days. Alaskans can thank the jet stream, which has been delivering warm air from the Pacific, said Dave Snider, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Anchorage. 'That position of the jet has been pretty stagnant, or at least in the general same position for a long period of time. While that's allowing a lot of cold air to flow out of the Arctic into the Midwest and the eastern seaboard, we're locked into the warmer part of that pattern, and we've continued to see those warm pushes for a fairly long period over the winter,' he said. Anchorage gets about 60 inches (150 centimeters) of snow in a normal year; this year only about 20 inches (50 centimeters) have fallen. The new route, which puts mushers on river ice for about 600 miles, could level the playing field. There are bare patches of grass and mud on sled dog trails in Anchorage, Alaska making it not ideal to hold the world famous dog sled race . 'Nobody has a plan,' Nordman said. 'You're not going to be stopping and putting your snow hook into the same tree you had the last 20 years. It's a whole new ballgame.' Brent Sass of Eureka, Alaska, is running his third Iditarod, and is coming off a win in last month's 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race. 'It doesn't hurt a guy like me who has only run the race a couple of times,' he said of the route change. 'For the guys that have run the race 20 times, it's not just the normal routine so it might throw them off a little bit.' Among the veterans in this year's race is the defending champion, Dallas Seavey, and the 2014 bizarre finish will be remembered as much as the poor trail conditions. Stan Hooley, the chief executive officer of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, is silhouetted as video of a musher wiping out in the 2014 race plays behind him during a meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, ahead of the 2015 race . A sudden blizzard blew four-time champion and race leader Jeff King out of the race when he was about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the finish line of the nearly 1,000-mile race. Then Aliy Zirkle, who was solidly in second place, waited out the storm at the last checkpoint, 22 miles (35 kilometers) from Nome, for two hours, 38 minutes. She got back on the trail when Seavey blew through the checkpoint, but lost the race by two minutes, 22 seconds. It was her third straight runner-up finish with no wins. The route change eliminates the mountainous terrain and treacherous gorge, but it could present mushers with a whole new set of problems with a flat trail on unpredictable river ice. Plus, because it's an entirely new route, mushers say they can't rely much on information, even something as simple as the mileage between village checkpoints, provided by Iditarod officials. By removing the Alaska Range, mushers may assume it will be a very fast race, Seavey said. 'Just because it's a flat trail does not mean your dogs can all of a sudden do 10 times what they've been able to do in the past,' said Seavey, a two-time champion. 'I feel that is a trap that will catch a lot of people.' 'In the end, this race will not be won on tricks or gimmicks. It will be won on good dogmanship,' he said.

"A dying father known as 'napkin dad' for his daily heartfelt notes to his daughter, has celebrated seeing her achieve another milestone: making her high school varsity softball team. Garth Callaghan, 45, from Glen Allen, Virginia, has been writing short messages on napkins for his daughter Emma, 15, since she was in kindergarten - and now she looks forward to them every day. The heartwarming ritual has scored him a book deal and a movie is said to be in the works too.

'My goal is to actually write notes for my grandkids and I can't think of a better thing to fight for every single day.' Emma says that she also maintains a positive attitude when it comes to her father's illness. 'I don't even really think about the fact he has cancer too much because he's so present and always there.' The note-writing has long been a tradition in the Callaghan household; it began when Garth worked a busy sales job in Emma's elementary school days and wouldn't see her often.

Daily dose: So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box . Still going strong: But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, Emma had come to expect the memos . So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box. But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, Emma had come to expect the memos. Some days, she would look at her lunch before he had placed on inside, and she'd demand to know where it was. 'That's when I realized, this is something that really matters,' Garth said. Garth's wife, Lissa, said the task also means he's taken over the chore of making his daughter's lunch, which he tries to keep healthy. 'I think it's great,' she said. 'It's nice that he keeps that connection with her.' Lunchtime treat: He pops the notes in with her lunch, which he tries to make as nutritious as he can . Determined: After learning he had cancer, Garth sought to write 800 notes so that his daughter would have one every day throughout high school - even if he was no longer alive to put it in her lunch box . But in 2011, Garth was diagnosed with cancer and his desire to write the notes became even stronger because, 'at the end of the day, these notes might be the only thing my daughter has left of me'. His tumor was successfully removed - but he has since been diagnosed twice more, and his doctor has told him that he will lose his life to the disease. A loss of taste, tiredness and nausea are among the symptoms which blight Garth. He says his ultimate hope is to inspire parents to write notes to their children. His book, Napkin Notes: Make Lunch Meaningful, Life Will Follow, has been published in several countries and half a dozen languages. In the tome, Garth  introduces each chapter with a napkin note and then shares a story connected to it and to his life. The cancer patient is now writing notes ahead of time and storing them away so his daughter can still receive them after he is gone.

An upcoming dance show called Nothing To Lose is giving plus-sized woman the chance to show off their curvaceous figures and aims to be a demonstration of what an overweight body can do . Brainchild of director Kate Champion and associate artist Kelli Jean Drinkwater, it will run at the Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne, Australia. The company's artistic director, Kate, teamed up with filmmaker and activist recognised internationally for her work in radical body politics, Kelli, in order to explore and celebrate the movement of bigger bodies in the show. The production premiered at the Sydney Festival in January but will open to the public on March 11 . The company's artistic director, Kate Champion teamed up with Kelli Jean Drinkwater in order to explore and celebrate the movement of bigger bodies in the show . Speaking about the production, Kelli said: 'When Kate told me she wanted to create a new piece of dance theatre with a cast of undeniably bigger bodies I was overwhelmed. 'But the response to Nothing to Lose has been positive beyond our wildest expectations. 'We've had huge amounts of interest internationally - from places as far and wide as London to Hong Kong to Buenos Aires.

The founders of the production say they've had huge amounts of interest internationally - from places as far and wide as London to Hong Kong to Buenos Aires . In a video for the Sydney Festival, the choreographer recalled realising that she 'needed to find someone who lives in the bigger body' in order to move forward with her idea. She later enlisted Ms Drinkwater, who worked as a plus-size model. 'I had no idea the level of abuse that a lot of [the show's dancers] experience daily and how they have to prepare themselves to go out in public all the time,' Ms Champion said. 'That's quite shocking.' She added that she hopes to create a space where the audience can view the plus-sized dancers in a 'different way and actually just enjoy the physical form moving’.

Ms Drinkwater says she hopes to create a space where the audience can view the plus-sized dancers in a 'different way and actually just enjoy the physical form moving' Nothing to Lose is another example of how body acceptance movements and campaigns have gained popularity over recent years. Last October, radio producer Whitney Way Thore showcased her amazing dance moves in a series of weight acceptance videos titled A Fat Girl Dancing as a part of her No Body Shame Campaign. Thore is now starring in her own TLC reality series, My Big Fat Fabulous Life, which premiered on January 13. And in 2014, a number of women took to social media to share photos of their bikini bodies after plus-size fashion blogger Gabi Gregg posted a picture of herself in a two-piece swimsuit with the hashtag #fatkini. Miss Gregg has since launched two collections of swimwear for women sizes 10 through 24, with the first selling out within 48 hours.

"Homeowners should consider fitting CCTV to trap burglars, the country's most senior police officer declared yesterday. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said police forces needed more crime scene footage to match against their 12million images of suspects and offenders. And he called on families and businesses to install cameras at eye level – to exploit advances in facial recognition technology. Scroll down for video . Bernard Hogan Howe said families and businesses should install their own CCTV cameras to help catch burglars . But privacy campaigners condemned the Metropolitan Police Commissioner's suggestion. 'The proposals on increasing the amount of privately owned CCTV cameras are quite frankly Orwellian and risk turning members of the public into an extension of the police,' said Renate Samson of Big Brother Watch. 'Private CCTV is completely unregulated. Recommending greater use of CCTV to gather more images of people's faces – often innocent people's faces – undermines the security of each and every one of us.' She pointed out that a House of Commons committee had on Saturday released a report on the problems with facial recognition. Labour MP Andrew Miller said: 'We were alarmed to discover that the police have begun uploading custody photographs of people to the police national database and using facial recognition software without any regulatory oversight. Some of the people had not even been charged.' Sir Bernard said most cameras were mounted high to keep them out of harm's way and to give an overview of a crime area. He was speaking after Beverley Turner, wife of Olympic rower James Cracknell, challenged him on LBC Radio on whether CCTV could be used to catch burglars. Her house was burgled while she and her children were sleeping and footage from a neighbour's CCTV camera was too grainy to identify the thieves. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner said Britain needed more cameras to help fight crime and urged people to think about installing them . When Miss Turner asked if more cameras were needed in homes and businesses, Sir Bernard replied: 'Yes. We've got a strategy to encourage people to move their cameras down to eye level. 'Facial recognition software has got better, and we can now apply it to images of burglaries, and then compare them with images we take when we arrest people. 'What we need to be able to do is to be able to compare that photograph with the images we have of people committing a crime. 'Taking the tops of their heads is not that helpful for facial recognition which relies on the eyes and the configuration of the area around the nose and the mouth. So we're trying to get people to, ideally, add a camera at face level. 'If anyone listening has a business, think about installing a new one – they're relatively cheap. If you can't buy one, could you think about moving it?' Covert cameras disguised as clocks, clothes hooks, mirrors and even thermometers can be bought for as little as £40. They have been responsible for an avalanche of 'peeping Tom' prosecutions involving footage taken in changing rooms, offices and toilets. Many bookmakers use them to identify robbers or fraudsters.The Green peer Baroness Jones said it was wrong to encourage householders to follow suit. 'It threatens to undermine people's confidence and inject fear in the place where they should feel most secure,' she said. 'I'm not sure it will make anyone feel any safer and the use of facial recognition technology remains largely untested and unproven.' Research from the College of Policing last week revealed CCTV only modestly cuts crimes such as vandalism and car theft and is useless in stopping violence. Experts said better street lighting and neighbourhood watch schemes were more valuable. This is the moment that a thief was caught on camera as he came out of the wardrobe he had been hiding in for 13 hours, armed with a poker. Aaron Bradford, 18, broke into Rosalinde Potter's house in Yelverton, Devon, for a third time in the middle of the afternoon but was disturbed when she returned at 2.40pm. She saw the house had been ransacked and called police unaware that Bradford was still in her home and when police arrived he stayed quiet in his hiding place. But what he did not know is that Ms Potter had installed CCTV cameras after being victim to burglaries in the past. Armed with a poker, Aaron Bradford, 18, looks around one of the rooms of after hiding for 13 hours . She said: 'We were all in the room while he was there - me, a police officer, another officer taking fingerprints, my partner. He was within arms reach of all of us. 'There's a shelf inside and I assume he was sitting there like a gnome holding a fishing rod. He's slim but 6ft tall so I think that's the only way he could have done it. 'We went into the spare room with the police three times while he was sat inside there. I went back into the room myself later too. It's very disturbing to think that someone might actually want to hit me with a poker. 'It took me three weeks before I could even sleep at night just thinking someone could be in the house.' The cameras filmed him as he tried to make a getaway with a laptop and camera, brandishing a poker at 4am once his victim had gone to bed. In one clip that Ms Potter released, Bradford can be seen going into a room where he stands for a short while before turning a light on. He surveys the room, turns the light off and then using the glow from his mobile phone he carefully tiptoes around. He was arrested nearby and identified by the CCTV footage, which showed him entering the house on one day – and then leaving it on the next. After his arrest police found the stolen laptop in a bag that Bradford had with him. Bradford tiptoes through the home slowly and carefully before leaving the house with a camera . Prosecutor David Gittins said: 'The householder returned home to find the patio doors forced and items moved within the house. 'She reported the break-in to police. He hid in the wardrobe for 13 hours till 4am, then stole a camera, a laptop and a small amount of cash.' Mr Gittins said CCTV of the break-in had shown Bradford wearing a hood and entering the house on April 7, and leaving it on April 8. They burst into the flat with knives and baseball bats and robbed the man of cash, his Apple laptop and his mobile phone. Bradford also admitted using a bank card stolen from a woman's handbag to draw cash from her bank account. In addition, he stole a man's bank details and used them to act as a guarantor for a loan, securing £466 to pay for 45 mobile phone top-ups. Jason Beal, for Bradford, said his client showed 'contrition and remorse' and had made 'full and frank' admissions. He said: 'This is terribly sad. He has been in care as a child, been fostered by people who were kind to him and now shows contrition and remorse. His ambition is to join the Army.' Bradford was sentenced to five years in a young offenders' institution, less 57 days spent on remand. Judge Graham Cottle told Bradford: 'It is unclear what underpinned this sudden spate of serious offending.'","Bernard Hogan Howe said people installed their CCTV cameras too high .

"Labour could be dead in ten years, one of Ed Miliband’s closest advisers warns. Policy co-ordinator Jon Cruddas said the party could ‘disintegrate in real time’ because traditional supporters were splintering off to increasingly successful smaller parties. It comes as Mr Miliband’s party, which was formed in 1900, languishes in the polls as Labour voters defect to the Greens or SNP. Scroll down for video . Labour dead in ten years? The remarks will embarrass leader Ed Miliband (left) because policy co-ordinator Jon Cruddas (right) is meant to be rebuilding the party in the wake of New Labour . The remarks will embarrass Mr Miliband because Mr Cruddas is meant to be rebuilding the party in the wake of New Labour. During a debate on digital democracy, Mr Cruddas was asked whether Labour might go the same way as social democratic parties in Greece and Spain, which have been overtaken by radical anti-austerity movements. Asked whether Labour could be gone within a decade, Mr Cruddas replied: ‘Yes, yes. There is no safe ground for any orthodox parties, and the stakes could be high potentially. ‘They could just disintegrate in real time – and I include the party I represent.’ Labour’s biggest individual donor: John Mills (pictured) believes Mr Miliband’s flagship tuition fees policy will destabilise universities and not help working-class children . Last night it emerged Labour’s biggest individual donor believes Mr Miliband’s flagship tuition fees policy will destabilise universities and not help working-class children. Question to the Chancellor: Ed Balls has refused 13 times to rule out a post-election deal with the SNP . John Mills told The Daily Telegraph there were ‘redistributive problems’ with cutting fees to £6,000 a year, and warned it could hurt Labour’s economic credibility. The founder of shopping channel firm JML also said the party was likely to fall short of a majority. It marks the biggest internal challenge to Labour’s tuition fees position since Mr Miliband revealed the proposals a fortnight ago. Mr Mills said: ‘What it’s doing is helping middle-class rather than working-class children.’ Meanwhile, Ed Balls refused 13 times to rule out a post-election deal with the SNP yesterday. Despite a growing clamour for Labour to reject any power-sharing with the SNP, the Shadow Chancellor dodged repeated questions on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. He said: ‘It is not part of our plans. I’m not going to get involved in speculation about post-election deals.’","Policy co-ordinator Jon Cruddas says it could 'disintegrate in real time'

"Rap duo Run the Jewels's show during the SXSW festival in Austin was interrupted when an unruly fan rushed up on stage and took a swing at one of the hip-hop stars. An unidentified man attempted to hit rapper El-P, though his bandmate Killer Mike pushed the fan off of the stage toward security. Killer Mike was seen on video taunting the fan with expletives as security followed him into the crowd, knocking the man to the ground with a punch when it appeared he was heading back to the stage. Scroll down for video .

A security guard (left, in black shirt) knocked the fan (right, in striped shirt) to the ground near the barrier between the audience and stage . 'Your mother should be ashamed you were born,' the rapper screamed. Guards are later seen fighting the man in the crowd after he got up. Run the Jewels, who received critical praise for their second self-titled album last year, continued with their set after a break. 'Sorry for the brief interruption,' El-P said later on his Twitter account. The rapper said that the attacker, who he called 'obviously mentally ill', had not been arrested and was let go by police. 'Its 1 thing for us and our crew, Its more dangerous for random people,' he said. El-P called the man 'dangerous and loose' and added that he had been seen walking around SXSW talking to himself. He said he was grateful for his 'crew' of Killer Mike and the security guards. Rapper El-P, a member of Run the Jewels, said that the man, who  was 'obviously mentally ill,' was not arrested by police . The attacker was tossed from the venue by private security and Austin police did not investigate because the matter was already handled internally by the event, according to KXAN. Run the Jewels was performing at the Spotify House, and their show was not officially part of SXSW. A representative for Spotify said, 'We take security extremely seriously. (We) want to make sure we continue to use the best possible security practices for the continued safety of everyone here.' A SXSW representative told Daily Mail Online that 'The safety of our attendees, artists, staff and volunteers is, and has always been, a top priority' and referred to the Austin Police Department.

"Australian jihadist widow Zehra Duman is believed to be using social media to try and recruit other young women to join the Islamic State and become Jihadi brides in Syria. The 21-year-old woman fled to Syria from Melbourne and married jihadist fighter Mahmoud Abdullatif - known as ‘The Playboy Jihadi - who was killed five weeks later. The young woman is using website ask.fm to speak candidly and answer anonymous questions about herself; including her grief over her dead husband, life as a Jihadi Bride and her parents’ reaction to her decision to flee to Syria. Scroll down for video . Vanished: Zehra Duman, pictured, left behind a distraught family when she fled for the Middle East late in 2014. She later posted that she had married jihadist fighter Mahmoud Abdullatif, married . A Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5, which they said originated in France . When asked how her parents reacted when she left for Syria, Duman opened up about her parents’ anguish. ‘They were shocked, as I never have been public with my Jihadi views,’ she wrote. ‘But also heartbroken, as my mum was very close to me… and she knows she will never see me again.’ The 21-year-old also describes her grief for her husband, to whom she was married for five weeks as ‘we got married in December, and he got Shahada in January’. Duman has been opening up on life in Syria and answering questions like this on social media website ask.fm . In another image, the women are pictured posing in head-to-toe black dress under an Islamic State flag . ‘Every day, there’s not a moment I don’t think of (my husband),’ she writes. ‘He was the perfect husband. Had such a beautiful heart, and character. ‘Allah didn’t want to keep him here in filthy Dunya.’ The young recruiter, who also calls herself ‘Umm Abdullatif’, gives a glowing review of and tells curious people posing questions ‘you need to come and see for yourself’. One minute, she is gushing that: ‘the lifestyle here is amazing, it is something you need to see for yourself’. The next, Duman states that she is well-armed with ‘a klash, a pistol, a few knives, also a bunch of grenades’. She says she is ‘more than happy’ to look for husbands for people, and then urges them to continue the conversation with her using another app, such as Kik or Surespot. When asked ‘what do you miss about Australia?’ she responds ‘0’, confirming her intention to never return. Worse still, the Jihadi Bride explains that although women are currently not allowed to fight, she eagerly awaits the moment she can enter the conflict in the hope of becoming a martyr. ‘They dont need sisters to fight… we have our lions ♡ but maybe one day soon, it just might happen... which i cannot wait for (sic),’ she wrote. Alarming: Zehra Duman posted this photograph to social media with the caption: '5 star jihad. M5 (the BMW) in the land of sham (Syria) he he ' Vile caption: The former Melbourne woman sprayed a series of hateful messages on social media on . Despite confessing that she expects to die, the young woman is adamant that is not fearful. ‘Whats there to be scared of? We have Allah,’ she wrote. However, Duman appears to threaten one user when one user says: 'Imagine one day the Yazedis take all Muhajirat as Slaves.' The Melbourne jihadi bride retaliates by saying: 'Imagine one day the Muhajirat take you as a slave...' The brazen 21-year-old also confirms that she is in contact with other Melbourne women who have already fled to Syria, writing: ‘I do know a few Melbourne sisters.’ Duman is now renowned for being provocative and confrontation on social media, particularly through her Twitter use. In a series of propaganda pictures she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen. In March photographs were posted to a Twitter account believed to belong to the former Melbourne woman, depicting several women standing under an Islamic State flag, reclining against a clean white BMW M5, wielding machine guns and dressed from head to toe in black Islamic dress. In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?' Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.' Duman's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts. It also  featured pictures of her late reported partner, the so-called 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif, as her 'beautiful husband'. Daily Mail Australia reported in January that Duman congratulated her late partner for his death after he was reportedly killed. 'You won the race!' she tweeted, describing him as a 'green bird' - the term used to describe a so-called martyr. Australian-born jihadist: Mahmoud Abdullatif, who was reported dead in January, is praised by his late wife Zehra Duman on social media . Duman congratulated her husband on his death in January, saying: 'You won the race!' The identities of the jihadist women in Ms Duman's pictures are unclear. However, the BMW bears resemblance to the same vehicle Australian jihadist and former underworld figure Mohammed Elomar was pictured smirking and wielding a Glock next to in September 2014. Same car? Notorious Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar was pictured in front of a white BMW which was reportedly from France . Defensive: Zehra Duman justified boasting about her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - but was then forced to defend the posts, telling her followers to 'chill n stop jujjing' Shortly after boasting about the expensive vehicle, Duman became defensive on social media and said 'no one is trying to be flashy' 'The m5 was driven here from france (sic) and is meant to be sold here. Chill n stop (judging). No one is trying to be flashy in sham (Syria).' Duman fled Australia late last year, leaving behind a distraught family, who told reporters she had been 'brainwashed'. The tweets, pictured here, have since been deleted . The Herald Sun quoted her father, Duvat Duman, saying: 'She’s been brainwashed, she wasn’t like this three or four months ago.' Khaled Sharrouf's wife Tara Nettleton is among the Australian females who have joined the Islamic State. Australian teenager Jake Bilardi was reported dead in a suicide bombing in Ramadi, Iraq, last week.","Australian ISIS widow appears to be using ask.fm to answer  questions .

"Britain will invest £180million over the next ten years in defending the Falkland Islands against a ‘very live’ threat from Argentina, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said today. The announcement comes amid fears of an invasion after it emerged Vladimir Putin could be helping to re-arm the South American nation by leasing them 12 long-range bombers. Mr Fallon said Britain’s military presence on the South Atlantic territory would be ‘beefed up’ following the findings of a review by top brass. There are fears of an invasion of the Falklands after it emerged Vladimir Putin could be helping to re-arm the South American nation by leasing them 12 long-range bombers . But later he told MPs that there would be no more troops or fighter planes sent to the British territory after the review found UK’s military forces were at the ‘level required’ to ensure its protection against any threat. Instead the UK would ‘modernise’ its defences in the region by investing in some of the ‘ageing infrastructure’, as a well as upgrading a surface-to-air missile system. His comments come amid claims there is a heightened risk of invasion by Argentina. Mr Putin is understood to be working on a deal to lease 12 Sukhoi Su-24 long range bombers to the country. Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said the reported deal with Putin was ‘very serious’. He said: ‘It is very serious indeed. Putin has many problems at home and yet he is ramping up tension in the Falklands. ‘Our policy has been to deter Argentina from repeating the folly of 1982. When you have a volatile political leadership, that is when things can get very dangerous. ‘The decision to invest £180million and continue with ground based air defences is welcome.’ The long-running dispute over the sovereignty of the British overseas territory has surfaced again in recent years under the presidency of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Speaking before he addressed MPs in the Commons, Mr Fallon told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘The threat remains. It is a very live threat. We have to respond to it. ‘We do need to modernise our defences to ensure that we have sufficient troops there and that the islanders have the right to remain British and the right to proper protection by our forces. ‘It is our general view that the threat has not reduced.’ However in the Commons he admitted that no more troops would be sent, nor would any more fighter jets be deployed after a review concluded current defence of the garrison was sufficient. He told MPs: ‘I have endorsed the assessment… that the current military presence is broadly proportionate to the threats and risks we face. ‘Our forces in the South Atlantic are entirely defensive, and are at a level required to ensure the defence of the Falkland Islands against any potential threat. ‘For the foreseeable future we will keep our numbers at around their current levels of about 1,200 personnel, military and civilian.’ Britain must build up its defence capabilities  in response to the threat posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. There are claims he is ramping up tensions in in the Falklands, which have been heightened in recent years under the presidency of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner . A source said: ‘I think the defence secretary meant to say “modernising” rather than “beefing up”.’ Amid threats from Argentina, Mr Fallon said the Army would deploy two RAF Chinook helicopters which were used in Afghanistan and which would replace the search and rescue Sea King helicopters already in the region. The helicopters would enable the islands’ garrison to mount a ‘swift and decisive response’ to ‘any emerging incidents’, it was said. Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said the reported deal with between Russia and Argentina was ‘very serious’ He also announced the UK would deliver enhanced operational communications to better ‘enable to the sharing of real time operational data’. Britain will also renew the ground based air defence system when Rapier, a surface-to-air missile system, comes out of service around the end of the decade, he said. The Falkland Islands Patrol Vessel, HMS Clyde, would also remain in the region. ‘We should not drop our guard’, he told MPs, insisting the UK was ‘not complacent’ and the Government would continue to remain ‘vigilant’. £180million would also be used to improve the quality of life of those in the Falklands, including improving accommodation and a new primary school. A number of projects will be carried out to replace some of the ‘ageing infrastructure’, including the refurbishment of Mare Harbour and the replacement of the existing power generation systems. A major modernisation of the fuels infrastructure is also underway, he said. But only four RAF Typhoon jets are stationed there permanently and there are no plans to increase those numbers, Mr Fallon admitted. His comments to the House came after he told Sky News: ‘I’m going to be announcing to Parliament later today how we’re going to beef up defences there, how we’re going to modernise our defences. He added that he intended ‘to reassure the islanders that we’re absolutely committed to their right to remain British and to the defence of the islands’.","Defence Secretary Michael Fallon promises to 'beef up' military presence .

"A former council worker has been found guilty of trying to poison homeless people living in a park. Neville Douglas Welsh, 65, was accused of deliberately leaving iced coffee bottles filled with methylated spirits, detergent, mineral turps and weed killer around Dean Park, in Townsville, north Queensland. A co-worker told the court he saw Welsh put a bottle down and wipe his fingerprints from it after leaving it by a vacant shopfront. But Welsh's defence barrister, Harvey Walters, claimed that Welsh ‘forgot’ to take the bottle away, the Townsville Bulletin reported. Neville Douglas Welsh, 65, has been found guilty of attempting to poison homeless people on the streets of Townsville, north Queensland (stock photo shown) Groups of homeless people were known to congregate in the city's Dean Park . The co-worker also told Townsville District Court, where a jury found Welsh guilty of attempting to injure by noxious substance, that Welsh said: ‘I should have put Ratsak and chillies in there to burn their guts.’ Other co-workers said Welsh left the bottles at shopfronts because from his experience working as a street cleaner he thought the homeless would ‘drink anything’. They said he was trying to get them to ‘p**s off’. Groups of homeless people were known to congregate in the city park. The former Townsville City Council worker will be sentenced in the same court on Wednesday. Neville Douglas Welsh worked for Townsville Council as a street cleaner . In August 2013, after Welsh’s first court hearing, Townsville Council CEO Ray Burton told the ABC the incident had distressed staff. ‘I have many staff who have contacted me through management and individually in terms of their shock and being appalled in respect to this matter,"" he said. ‘It's certainly not behaviour we condone among our staff.’ Mr Burton said as soon as the Council heard about the matter they conducted a sweep of the area to ensure there were no drinking bottles or containers near Dean Park.

"Outlaw: Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was arrested by Thai police Tuesday after spending six years on the run to avoid being deported back to the US, where she was sentenced in 2007 to prison time . An Alabama woman who fled the US after being charged in a fatal DUI crash and spent the past six years on the run was captured in Thailand this week. The Tourist Police in the Thai resort town of Phuket City announced during a press conference Wednesday that Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, will be deported back to the US, where she had been sentenced to prison in the 2004 death of 57-year-old Florida truck driver Donald Goodwin. According to investigators, Ms Miller has been living as a fugitive in Thailand ever since she escaped from Alabama in 2009. Miller, who gave birth to a baby boy while on the run, threw out her passport and spent the past six years island-hopping to avoid detection, said police officials. Miller's luck ran out Tuesday when police acting on a tip from the US Embassy caught up with her on the remote island of Koh Lanta, off the coast of Krabi province, reported the Thai publication Phuketwan. Tourist Police officials said the 36-year-old woman had been moving between Koh Lanta, Samui and Hang islands without a current visa. Investigators said Miller delivered her son two months ago in a small clinic on the island of Samui, and his birth was not registered. Thai authorities believe Miss Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to her to help her make ends meet. She overstayed her welcome: Miller, pictured at a news conference with police Wednesday, arrived in Bangkok in January 2009 . Not impressed: Miller (left and right) appeared bored during a police press conference as officials recounted for reporters the circumstances of her arrest . On her way out: The 36-year-old new mom is expected to be deported back to the US along with her 2-month-old son . About a month ago, police in the US somehow learned of Miller's whereabouts and have been keeping tabs on her movements. On Tuesday at around 9am Phuket time, an officer with the Tourist Police approached Miller in the parking lot of a Koh Lanta guesthouse and asked her to show her passport. When she was unable to produce the document, the officer placed her under arrest. During today's press conference with police, the 36-year-old American fugitive appeared indifferent and unconcerned by the proceedings, casually propping her chin with her hand. At one point, she was reportedly seen applying lipstick as police recounted the circumstances of her arrest in Thai. Police said Kelly Lynn Miller met the father of her baby, an American national living in Thailand legally, but the man said she never told him that she was an outlaw. Her two-month-old son is expected to be deported alongside her to the US in the near future. In 2004, Kelly Lynn Miller, then 26 years old, was driving drunk on Interstate 459 in Hoover, Alabama, when she struck and killed 57-year-old Donald Goodwin, according to Al.com. The Florida truck driver pulled over in the emergency lane and was checking the tires on his tractor-trailer when police said Miller sideswept the vehicle and then careened into Goodwin. Miller was arrested after the crash on DUI charges but was released the next day after posting $1,000 bond. Busted in paradise: Miller's luck ran out Tuesday when police acting on a tip from the US Embassy caught up with her on the remote island of Koh Lanta (pictured), off the coast of Krabi province . In 2006, a Jefferson County jury indicted Miller on a charge of vehicular homicide. She was re-arrested but again freed from jail after posting $10,000 bond. Miller was expected to go on trial in January 2007 but pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison. Before Miller was set to report to prison, she took off and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010. Following her arrest in Thailand Tuesday, the 36-year-old woman allegedly admitted to police that she flew into Bangkok in January 2009 and then spent the next six years traveling on an expired visa.","Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was arrested on remote island of Koh Lanta for living in Thailand on expired visa .

Clayton Lockett, who shot and buried alive Stephanie Neiman, 19, in 1999, was scheduled to be put to death by an untested cocktail of three drugs, including  midazolam, in Oklahoma on April 29. But after medical officials repeatedly failed to set up an intravenous line - ultimately, pumping the drugs into his femoral artery, causing them to leak into his tissue - he took  43 minutes to die. Now, newly-released transcripts of interviews with officials inside the state's death chamber have revealed grisly details of the moments leading up to the 'bloody mess' that was Lockett's death. Scroll down for video . Murder: Clayton Lockett (left), who shot and buried alive Stephanie Neiman (right), 19, in 1999, chatted with prison guards and even suggested a vein in his leg for his lethal injection, new documents have revealed . The botched killing led to a temporary moratorium on executions in Oklahoma while the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether the state's three-drug method is constitutionally humane. The interviews, which are among 5,000 pages of documents unveiled by the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety, show Lockett causally chatted with the paramedic who was inserting his IV line. He told the paramedic his arm was scarred from previous drug use, but  there still was a viable vein in it . 'And he said if you will go right above the scars, I have a good vein,' the paramedic said. Although the official took Lockett's advice and successfully inserted the needle, they did not have the right kind of tape to hold the line in place, so it came loose, according to the interview transcripts. Lockett, a former intravenous crystal meth user who had dehydrated himself for three hours for the execution, then suggested that officials insert the needle through his leg instead, NBC reported. 'He said, 'I've got a vein in my leg, my right leg,' the medic recalled in an interview. 'And I said, ""Well, I don't like to do those because they cause a lot of clots"". 'He said,""Does it really matter?""' Botchedi njection: Lockett was scheduled to be put to death at Oklahoma state prison (above)) by an untested cocktail of three drugs, including the sedative midazolam, on April 29. But after medical officials failed to set up his intravenous line - ultimately, pumping the drugs into his femoral artery - he took a huge 43 minutes to die . Lethal: Now, newly-released transcripts of interviews with officials inside the death chamber have revealed gthe moments leading up to Lockett's death. Above, one of the drugs used in the execution, midazolam . Officials ultimately chose to put the IV into Lockett's femoral vein through his groin, using a 1.25in needle that appeared to be too short for the procedure - the recommended length was 2.5in. 'Well, we'll just have to make it work,' the doctor told the concerned medic,  the transcripts state. By the time the second drug, a paralytic, was pumped into Lockett, it was clear something was wrong. The inmate, who was apparently 'very talkative until they raised the curtain' in his execution and then he shut up', had been declared unconscious, but he suddenly started writing in agony. 'One of the executioners said, ""He's trying to get up off the table"" and I thought, ""What?""' said the medic, who has not been identified. 'The warden was very upset. Nobody wants a prisoner in an execution situation to suffer.' Lockett, 38, also began clenching his teeth and groaning loudly, prompting officials to try unsuccessfully to stop the execution. More than 43 minutes after the killing began, Lockett died. Death row inmates typically take just 10 minutes to die from a lethal injection. The cocktail of drugs that Lockett had been injected with had not been previously used in the United States. Other witness interviews, unveiled to the Associated Press after The Tulsa World successfully filed a lawsuit against authorities, also laid bare the scale of the fiasco surrounding Lockett's execution. Some witnesses said the killing resembled a scene from a 'horror movie'. Meanwhile, prison warden Anita Trammel described it as a 'bloody mess' as the inmate bucked up from the gurney when he was meant to be unconscious, the New York Times reported. Halted: After Lockett's execution went awry, Gov Mary Fallin ordered a halt to the second scheduled killing of Charles Warner (left), who sexually assaulted and killed 11-month-old baby Adrianna Waller (right) in 1997 . DPS released a 32-page summary of its investigation in September, which blamed most of the execution's problems on a failed single IV line in Lockett's groin. However, the agency did not release the documents connected to its probe until after The Tulsa World's lawsuit. The investigation revealed a failed line caused the drugs to be administered locally instead of into Lockett's blood, but the doctor overseeing the execution did not notice a problem with the site. This is because Lockett's lower body was covered with a sheet, the transcripts state. The documents also reveal that the newly hired executive director of the Department of Corrections, Robert Patton, was concerned about his lack of involvement in the execution preparations. Prison warden: Anita Trammel (pictured) described Lockett's execution as a 'bloody mess' as the inmate bucked up and groaned on the gurney . Patton told investigators he didn't even know the agency had acquired the drugs for the execution until he learned it from the media. 'I found out that they had found a pharmacist and the drugs, uh through a news report,' Patton said, according to a transcript of his interview. The testimony of Patton and others involved in the execution suggest there was nervousness and unease with two executions scheduled on the same night using a new three-drug formula that hadn't been used in Oklahoma before. 'These were particularly concerning to me,' Patton said. 'A new protocol, one I was not familiar with really.' Indeed, the unidentified paramedic recalled: 'There was an air of urgency there. The ""quick quick, got to get it done, got to get it done and got to make sure that everything is done right"".' After Lockett's execution went awry, Gov. Mary Fallin ordered a halt to the second scheduled execution of Charles Warner, who raped and murdered an 11-month-old girl in 1997. Warner was executed nearly nine months later, on Janyary 15, using the same three drugs in Lockett's execution, but with a five-fold increase the amount of the first drug, midazolam. Since Warner's execution, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to consider a challenge to the new three-drug method from a group of Oklahoma death row inmates who claim the sedative won't properly render them unconscious before the second and third drugs are administered. A legal brief in that case filed this week by 16 pharmacology professors at US universities states that midazolam is incapable of rendering an inmate unconscious and is an inappropriate first drug to use. The court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case on April 29. Patton and other state officials have publicly acknowledged midazolam is not the preferred drug for lethal injection, but one that was selected when other more effective, drugs became unavailable. because manufacturers refused to sell them to states for use in executions. All execution officials' names and identifying information were redacted from the DPS records.","Clayton Lockett, 38, shot and buried alive Stephanie Neiman, 19, in 1999 .

"A 61-year-old Wisconsin man has been arrested in connection with the nearly 25-year-old murder of a Sturtevant woman whose body was found in a ditch weeks after she disappeared. Dennis J. Brantner was arrested in Berit Beck's killing after he made an appearance on an unrelated charge in Kenosha County. He's now been charged with first degree homicide. The 18-year-old Beck was killed in July 1990 after she stopped in Fond du Lac while traveling. Her body was found about six weeks later in a ditch in rural Fond du Lac County. Break: Police have arrested a suspect in a Wisconsin murder nearly 25 years on. Berit Beck (right) was 18 in July 1990 when she vanished, only to be found strangled in a ditch over a month later. Now, local trucker Dennis Brantner, 61, (left) has been arrested for the crime . Authorities said last year they had evidence that pointed Brantner and named him as a suspect. A court document says his fingerprints were on items in Beck's van. 'This has always been a no-win situation no matter how it works out,' Fond du Lac County Sheriff Mick Fink told the Fond du Lac Reporter. 'We will go forward. We talked with the Becks and they have been notified.' Beck was heading to a work seminar in Appleton, Wisconsin when she vanished. It is believed she stopped at a Walgreens during her journey, which is the last place she was seen alive. According to a complaint obtained by the Fond du Lac Reporter, 'no physical evidence directly links ... (anyone) other than Dennis J. Brantner to the GMC van Berit Beck was last seen driving.' Police say Brantner's fingerprints were found March 11 on a cigarette cellophane that was inside Beck's van. When he was interviewed by police last year, he said he had no idea how they got there. However, he reportedly asked police 'why would I do anything like that in the first place?' before police told him she was a murder victim. Physical evidence: Brantner was first named as a suspect in 2014 but told police he had nothing to do with the cold case murder. However, Fond du Lac police say they've since connected him, and only him, to the van Beck was driving when she vanished using fingerprints . He soon became emotional, however. 'I don't remember anything. I don't wanna,' Brantner told police. '(If) I did I did...if I did I don't know.' Though he was not in custody at the time of Beck's disappearance, Brantner was arrested on an unrelated matter two weeks later on August 6 1990 and has a criminal record going back to the 1970s. And, in 1994, he was arrested for kidnapping and beating his estranged second wife. Brantner was unknown to Beck's family prior to police naming him as a suspect in 2014. Meanwhile, they have asked for privacy in the matter. 'We are encouraged and relieved for this day to have arrived for Berit and our family. We request that our privacy be respected as this process unfolds,' the family said through a police press release. Speaking at a press conference last year, Sheriff Fink was hopeful about the developments. 'This is the best physical evidence that we've had in this case,' he said. 'It was the first time that I thought we had tangible, physical evidence to intimately put someone in the interior of that van.'

"From witnessing the breathtakingly beauty of the Guerrero mountain range to getting food poisoning in Morocco, David Brain experienced more than just feats of brilliance while filming World’s Most Talented. The 31-year-old co-host of the interactive talent show, which will be broadcast for the first time tonight, travelled to India, Mexico, Italy, Argentina and Morocco and caught up with four people from each country. His first stop on the tour was India, a place he ventured through on planes, trains and bikes and described as ‘crazy on every single level’ – a billing that stunt couple Mr and Mrs Budati certainly lived up to. Scroll down for video . David Brain, 31, the co-host of World's Most Talented, which will broadcast for the first time tonight at 9pm on Watch . Filmed in the middle of a jungle, Mr Budati demonstrated his outrageous ability to rest a coconut on his wife’s throat and slash it in two with a machete, leaving her entirely unharmed. Discussing the stunt, David Brain told MailOnline Travel: ‘The local village came down to watch the event and all of them were really calm – I was this flappy English bloke who wasn’t sure about it. ‘I was genuinely worried. My facial expression as it is seen on the show was real.’ According to Mr Budati, he approaches the stunt by removing the audience and consequences from his thoughts and remaining calm – a state of mind every Indian competitor seemed to possess, remarked David. Mr Budati demonstrated his  ability to rest a coconut on his wife’s throat and slice it in two with a machete . Mr Budati says that he approaches the stunt by removing the audience and consequences from his thoughts and remaining calm . Serenity was also a theme in Argentina, where David got to witness what would retrospectively become one of his favourite performances of the series – Gaucho cowboy Martin Tatta  performing horse yoga. ‘Martin Tatta was one of my favourite performers for personal reasons – I’m a bit wary of horses,' said David. ‘His relationship with the horse was just so good, so calming. He uses no equipment and never uses violence or a whip, the bond is created by total respect and trust – it was a real moment.’ The London-based presenter even admitted that had he been able to adopt an ability for himself, he would have chosen Mr Tatta’s, as the skill would impress his partner – a horse enthusiast. Argentine Gaucho cowboy Martin Tatta exerted complete control over a horse while performing yoga with it . David admitted that had he been able to adopt an ability for himself he would have chosen Mr Tatta's so that he could impress his partner . ‘It would have to be the horse yoga, even though there are things that were definitely cooler. She [his partner] would be pleased if she came in and saw me with one relaxed on the floor,’ he said. ‘Also, I like the idea of serenity and chilling out, especially as I live in London, and Martin’s performance was the purest moment of utter serenity.’ Despite the moments of tranquillity experienced on the trip, David also endured his fair share of turmoil and a bout of food poisoning in Morocco certainly took its toll. David said: ‘We filmed India and Morocco together and I was careful that everything was piping hot and that I wasn’t going to eat meat in India – I was militant. David described Aziz Salhi as a real showman and was impressed by his strength and ability . The presenter noted that the road had been closed and 500 people had turned out to witness Aziz Salhi's show of strength . ‘So when I got to Morocco I felt like I had survived India and paid a hefty price for playing with the rules. All I’m saying is don’t have the Caesar salad in Casablanca.’ Morocco however did bring about some of David’s favourite moments and he recalls going to visit strongman Aziz Salhi, who holds off accelerating cars and keeps hold off accelerating motorbikes. ‘He was one of my favourite spectacles – a real showman. He told us that he had spoken to the government and that they were shutting down the roads for his stunt. ‘We were dubious, but we drove to the place and there must have been about 500 people, which included police and motorbike gangs outside the town hall. Pizza freestlyers Antonia and Vincenzo Scapicchio throw pizza dough among the young and hip people of Italy . David was impressed by the youngster's showmanship and stated that he had a 'Christina Aguilera level of attitude' ‘There was a lady there who must have been about 700-years-old, her son, or grandson, [the performer] wheeled her to the front and there were motorbikes doing wheelies next to her – I thought she was going to pass out. ‘Their crowd control was motorbikes doing doughnuts. Health and safety would never allow that to happen in the UK, but no one was hurt.’ Moving on to Italy, David found more excitable people and none encapsulated the sentiment more than father and son team Antonia and Vincenzo Scapicchio, the pizza freestylers. ‘Italy is a really nice place,’ said David, ‘the people look like they have walked out of a beauty advert. Not sure what to make of it! David admits that he was slightly confused by the pizza freestylers' act . ‘And in the middle of all these young and hip people is a man and his son, who eat a lot of pizza, throwing pizza dough. ‘It looked like they were stripping. I thought I was having some weird dream. Part of me felt like it was the best thing I had ever seen and the other part was thinking what are they doing? ‘The kid was really working the camera though, with a Christina Aguilera level of attitude.’ David’s visit to Mexico also brought about its fair share of interesting characters, and the country itself had a profound effect on the presenter. Mexican performer Eduardo Flores gets into position before head-butting a real nail threw a piece of wood . Shock horror! David recoils after watching Mr Flores use his head to hammer a nail through a piece of wood . He said: ‘At first I was annoyed that I was going to Mexico instead of Sweden. I am marrying a Swedish girl and she was saying that I know the country and could do a good job there.’ ‘But Mexico was so much fun. It was a place that really got me. Not so much Mexico City, but when we travelled to Acapulco we drove through a mountain range and it was just stunning, absolutely gorgeous. ‘People say it’s dangerous but I didn’t experience any of that, just very nice, friendly people.’ David’s meeting with Eduardo Flores while in Mexico, however – a man who head-butted a nail into a piece of wood – was less easy on the eye. Cool under pressure! In scorching temperature Khivraj Gurjar performs some controlled BMX yoga on a mountain . ‘He was there banging his forehead on this nail. I held it and it was definitely a nail,' said the presenter. ‘He was smashing concrete blocks up with his fist, and at the end he was really pumped and grabbed and shook my hand. When I took my hand away it was covered in blood.’ Other performances that caught David's eye during the series included a man named Khivraj Gurjar, who performed bike yoga while perched precariously from the side of a mountain in India. Describing the temperature as ‘hotter than the surface of the sun’, David explained how Mr Gurjar was completely serene as he balanced from his BMX. David enjoying himself by having a few midday drinks with breakdancing group Impacto Crew  in Mexico . A breakdancing group called Impacto Crew, who the presenter admits getting slightly drunk with in the midday Mexican sun, also evoked fond memories for the presenter. 'There were 40 people doing shots of Tequilla, singing songs and dancing. It was a crazy atmosphere but the acts were fantastic,' said David. However, not all performance went entirely to plan over the course of the series and a number of incidents saw proceedings become momentarily stalled. The performance of a young limbo skater called Gagan Satish resulted in some off-screen controversy with parents complaining that their children were not picked in place of the youngster. Young limbo skater  Gagan Satish was eventually able to perform after an argument momentarily hampered the show's progression . 'They were shouting at one another and driving their cars away to prevent him from performing,' recalls the presenter. Nature also played its part, with heavy rain in India temporarily hampering archer Jayalakshmi Sariknoda hopes of competing on the show. While rain and wind in Argentina halted the progression of tightrope walker Sebastian Petriw. In the end however all the performances were completed, and given the complexities involved, the filming of the show was ultimately a success. World’s Most Talented with air tonight at 9pm on Watch and the first episode will see India compete with Romania for the coveted crown.

"Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations at the White House for six years, ended her employment with no notice according to sources with 'close ties to current residence staffers' Despite leaving the White House more than a month ago, official confirmation of the chief floral designer's unexpected departure has only just emerged. Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations for events such as official state dinners for six years, ended her employment with no notice according to sources with 'close ties to current residence staffers'. Dowling 'was escorted from the building' on February 13, reports The Washington Post. In the wake of the Post's revelation and coming almost six weeks after Dowling's departure, the White House released a statement on Tuesday in which it praised her 'lively and colorful' creations, which reflected the 'historic rooms which they graced.' 'As chief florist, Laura Dowling and her team treated guests of the White House to their beautiful floral arrangements,' read a statement issued by Michelle Obama's office on Tuesday. 'Ms Dowling's creations were always lively and colorful, reflecting not only the season but the unique and historic rooms which they graced. 'No two arrangements were ever the same and each one left guests with a lasting impression of the elegance and history of the People's House. We are grateful for her contribution over the years and wish her well.' Within an hour of the first lady's official confirmation, Dowling also felt compelled to release a statement about her sudden departure weeks before. 'After almost six years as Chief Floral Designer at the White House, I have resigned in order to pursue exciting new opportunities and explore my passion for floral artistry and design,' said Dowling in a statement issued by heavyweight law firm Sidley Austin. The first lady's office released a statement on Tuesday which praised the work of florist Laura Dowling who had unexpectedly departed her post more than a month before . 'Over the next few weeks and months, I'll be launching a new platform for my work as an author, speaker, instructor and design consultant that builds on the creative ideas and partnerships I've formed during my tenure there. 'It's been such an honor to work at the White House and I will always be grateful for this incredible opportunity.' But Dowling's unexpected departure and the sudden release of two statements more than a month later has prompted speculation that all was not well between Dowling and the first lady. Several unnamed floral designers who continue to provide bouquets to the White House told the Post that Dowling left because her 'fussy style' wasn't in keeping with the first lady's desire for a modern and clean aesthetic. When Dowling was first appointed she was highly regarded for her organic and less formal 'French look,' but now that seems to have fallen out of favor at the White House. Just days before the florist's departure, the Old Family Dining Room had been re-opened after being refurbished by the First Lady to showcase modern art and design, according to the White House website. Dowling's predecessor, Nancy Clarke, had lasted through six presidential administrations. During her tenure as First Lady, Mrs Obama has taken a greater interest in gardening than most of her predecessors - but the focus has been herbs and vegetables rather than floral.

"Gabby Logan, left, pictured with her former rugby international husband Kenny, right, shamed a Twitter troll who told her to go back to the kitchen . Her father was an international footballer and she is married to a former rugby star. So when a troll tweeted that she should be a housewife rather than a TV sports presenter, Gabby Logan was on safe ground hitting back. She promptly named and shamed the man who described her a ‘f***ing geezer bird’ – and was swamped with praise by her followers. Yesterday Mrs Logan, 41, retweeted the sexist message, which appeared to have been sent to her by a web designer named Glen Hughes. It appears he hurled his abuse after Mrs Logan tweeted her thoughts about football. Writing using the Twitter handle @GlenWebLondon he said: ‘Who asked your opinion f****** geezer bird get back to kitchen” this is freelance web designer and latent feminist Glen’. Within minutes, scores of Mrs Logan’s 372,000 followers had applauded her for drawing attention to the troll, who has since deleted his profile. Among them was Alice Arnold, partner of fellow BBC presenter Clare Balding, who wrote: ‘Name and shame Gabby!! Good on you.’ Mrs Logan, whose father Terry Yorath was a Welsh international footballer and was part of the presenting team covering the World Cup in Brazil, replied: ‘Occasionally you just need to deliver a little upper cut for your own sanity don’t you think?’ And hundreds of other Twitter users offered their support to Mrs Logan, with one writing: ‘Gabby you are great, don’t worry about these silly people who don’t think before they speak. Others pledged to avoid working with the designer, including one who tweeted: ‘Any of my suppliers who use @GlenWebLondon will lose business.’ Another posted: ‘Good luck with your female colleagues tomorrow. Learn a bit of class from Gabby. Twit.’ Last night Vivienne Pattison of campaign group Mediawatch-UK said: ‘I’m really pleased that she’s in a position to be able to fight back about it. We hear lots of stories about people not in that position and some of them end really tragically. We are still navigating our way through the challenges that social media present but actually being abusive like that on Twitter is no different to publishing it anywhere else. Good on here. He clearly should have thought twice before pressing the button that says publish, because that is exactly what he’s done.’ It is not the first time Mrs Logan, who is the wife of former Scotland rugby star Kenny Logan, has used social media to name and shame a troll. Last month she shared a sexist remark from @garywall001, which read: @GabbyLogan you’re s*** on motd [Match Of The Day] get some ironing done,’ and wrote: ‘the thing is I am a woman so I can do both.’ In the past she has also voiced annoyance to be repeatedly asked ‘who is looking after the children’. Mrs Logan, who is mother two nine-year-old twins Reuben and Lois, told Essentials magazine: ‘People still think it’s a woman’s responsibility to organise everything. When I was away, some of the mums at school asked Kenny how he was coping. No one asked me that when he was working in Australia last year. I’m often asked who’s looking after the children when I’m away, yet my male colleagues aren’t.’ Mrs Logan’s Tweet came after International Women’s Day was celebrated on Sunday. Earlier this month she hosted a discussion at breakfast networking event for the campaign, in aid of the domestic violence charity Refuge. Gabby, left, pictured with her father, former Welsh international Terry Yorath, said she needed to respond to the insulting tweet 'to deliver a little upper cut for your own sanity don’t you think?’","Twitter user @glenweblondon allegedly attacked Gabby Logan online .

"A flamboyant Congressman who spent $40,000 of taxpayers' money redecorating his office in the style of 'Downton Abbey' and spent thousands more taking a private jet to watch a sporting event resigned on Tuesday. Aaron Schock, a Republican from Illinois, had faced fresh questions over 170,000 miles he claimed he had driven in a car which he sold with only 80,000 miles on the odometer. He had already been in the spotlight over a series of expense claims. Along with the makeover, he billed $10,000 for a private jet trip to watch the Chicago Bears play football. 'Today, I am announcing my resignation as a Member of the United States House of Representatives effective March 31,' Schock, 33, said in a statement issued by his Capitol Hill office. Scroll down for video . Gone: Aaron Schock in the office which he redecorated in the style of Downton Abbey and for which he claimed $40,000 in expenses – which he later had to repay out of his own pocket . RED IS THE COLOR:The lavish design appointments earned Schock snickers . 'GOOD LUCK TONIGHT': Schock tweeted this Instagram selfie with singer Ariana Grande, 21, before the American  Music Awards in November . 'I do this with a heavy heart. Serving the people of the 18th District is the highest and greatest honor I have had in my life. I thank them for their faith in electing me and letting me represent their interests in Washington.' But 'the constant questions over the last six weeks,' he admitted, 'have proven a great distraction that has made it too difficult for me to serve the people of the 18th District with the high standards that they deserve and which I have set for myself.' It was a dramatic turn from just last month when he flippantly responded to complaints about his lavish office redecoration. 'Haters gonna hate,' he replied then. Schock gained a reputation as a walking lifestyle magazine, attending entertainment awards show and giving interviews about his buff physique. In November he posted a selfie on Instagram that he snapped with 21-year-old singer Ariana Grande before the American Music Awards. Other Instagram snaps in his timeline show him mugging with Pope Francis, Apple Computer CEO Tim Cook, Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler, the country music band Lady Antebellum, and legendary cellist Yo-Yo Ma. REP. HARDBODY: Schock made a splash in May 2011 with this Men's Health magazine cover . THE CONGRESSMAN FROM NASHVILLE: Schock posed in 2014 with the Grammy-winning country group Lady Antebellum at an event focused on protecting musicians' intellectual property rights . 'BREAKFAST WITH A LEGEND': Schock bragged on Facebook in January 2014 that he met with famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma to talk about arts education in schools . Several other social media pictures show him speaking to reporters in his home district from behind a podium that cost $5,123 from his official ofice budget in 2009. According to Buzzfeed, the podium is a close facsimile of the one President Obama uses, complete with a circular seal – in this case, one that reads 'United States House of Representatives.' Politico was first to report Schock's resignation; his now-former district is centered on the small Illinois city of Peoria. The paper had earlier reported that he was facing new questions over his expenses: Schock had submitted claims for 170,000 miles he said he drove on Congressional business in his Chevy Tahoe. But the car, which he bought new, had just 80,000 miles on its odometer when it was sold. Schock's troubles also included accusations that he had hired a personal photographer to follow him around. He also chartered private planes and stayed in five-star hotels. He also allegedly sold his home to a donor who had built and financed it – receiving more than the property was worth. And National Journal reported last week that an outside group paid for a Schock companion, Shea Ledford, to travel to India. IPHONE AT THE READY FOR HIS HOLINESS: Schock posted online a photo of him greeting Pope Francis in January on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp . HE'S EVERYWHERE: Schock mugged with Apple Computer CEO Tim Cook in 2014 after the tech king's speech at an exclusive American Enterprise Institute event on tony Sea Island in the US state of Georgia . 'THE PRESIDENTIAL': Schock's congressional office budget covered more than $5,000 for this custom podium, styled after the one President Obama uses when he's on the road . Schock's air charters included one jaunt with staffers to a Katy Perry concert, and another in 2014 that saw him bring an entourage of 20 to New York where they reportedly did little work but saw a star-studded 'Global Citizen Festival' concert. That journey set taxpayers back $10,000; Schock justified it as a 'very legitimate trip' by noting that it coincided with a U.S. visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The festival and concert that were underwritten in part by the Peoria-based Caterpillar company. Salon reported in February that Schock had accepted a string of lavish gifts and meals in London, and hosted a September 2014 fundraiser at a Maryland golf course – 'The Aaron Schock Golf Classic' – which netted his political coffers $125,000. But his official financial disclosure documents showed no signs of the perks. Another visit to the UK saw Schock taking Ledford to several high-society meals hosted by the Prince of Wales Foundation in June 2011. Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, attended one of them. The events were hosted at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and a posh London nightclub. At the time a foundation spokeswoman told Politico that Schock had been 'a guest of a guest of the Prince of Wales, so he has no involvement with the foundation and therefore wasn’t in any way, shape or form involved other than attending a dinner as a guest of a guest.' LIVIN' ON THE EDGE: Schock posed with Aerosmith front-man Steve Tyler at last year's Country Music Awards . IN HIS FACE: Schock and his staff faced the glare of TV cameras on Tuesday as new organizations scrambled to confront him about his extravagant spending and alleged ethics lapses . FIRE YOURSELF: Schock bragged on Instagram in November after he met with real estate tycoon and possible presidential candidate Donald Trump at his Trump Tower office . Separately, Schock declared on a political campaign disclosure document that he had spent money on software purchases. The expense turned out to be for a private jet trip on an aircraft owned by a software company president. Congressional rules prohibit members from accepting any a gift worth more than $50. That includes food and beverages. The guidelines provide an exception for gifts from close personal friends, but even those require written approval from the House Ethics Committee – and later public disclosure – if they exceed $250. The Associated Press confirmed Monday that the Office of Congressional Ethics was investigating Schock's high-flying lifestyle while in office. The OCE is an outside panel that reviews ethics complaints against House members and makes recommendations to the ethics committee, which is composed of equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats. That committee, however, has no authority to investigate ethics-challenged lawmakers after they quit. In a statement, House Speaker John Boehner said: 'With this decision, Rep. Schock has put the best interests of his constituents and the House first. I appreciate Aaron's years of service, and I wish him well in the future.' TRAVEL BUDDY: Schock (right) posed with longtime friend Shea Ledford (center) and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (left) for a ceremonial swearing-in picture in 2011, at the beginning of his second term in office . PRESSURE: The flamboyant Schock had faced intense media scrutiny since his scandalous spending first hit the front pages in Illinois . Rep. Aaron Schock sold this Dunlap, Illinois house to political donors who built and financed it – allegedly keeping the profits . A source in House leadership told Daily Mail Online that Schock did not give anyone notice before making his announcement. 'We were all caught by surprise,' the congressional aide said Tuesday. 'It's a long time coming, but we had no idea it would happen today.' Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group, pounced a few hours after Schock's announcement. Anne Weismann, the group's executive director,called Schock's departure 'inevitable,' noting that he 'couldn’t say just last week whether or not he had broken the law.' Her group has separately filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which can continue to investigate. Schock is the second Republican member of the House of Representatives to quit in recent months under a cloud of scandal. Former New York Rep. Michael Grimm resigned his House seat after he agreed to plead guilty to federal tax evasion. The first order of busniess in the 114th Congress was to announce his departure. Illinois will hold a special election in the next 115 days to replace Schock in his district, according to state law. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner must announce a date within five days. Schock was first elected in 2009, succeeding Ray LaHood – who went on to be President Obama's transportation secretary. Voters re-elected Schock in 2012 with an overwhelming 74 percent of the vote.","Aaron Schock, 33, stepped down from House of Representatives after weeks of revelations about his spending .

"A professor helping to identify 600 body parts belonging to the Germanwings crash victims said today he would be haunted forever by the grim task. Remains of the 150 passengers and crew are being categorised after co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately flew the Airbus A320 into the French Alps. And Germany's most prestigious forensic scientist Michael Tsokos spoke of the work ahead as it emerged Lubitz's remains have already been found. Investigators at the crash site have so far retrieved about 600 body parts and have managed to isolate 78 distinct DNA strands from the remains. Some 50 bodies were identifiable visually, while many body parts were the size of a postage stamp - with the largest being the size of a suitcase. Scroll down for video . Michael Tsokos, Germany's most prestigious forensic scientist, said he will be haunted forever by the grim task of identifying the body parts of those killed when the plane crashed into the mountainside in the Alps. He said: 'These images will never go out of my head' Investigators at the Germanwings crash site have so far retrieved about 600 body parts and have managed to isolate 78 distinct DNA strands from the remains. But not one body has been found intact by rescue crews who continue to comb the site for remains (pictured) Professor Tsokos admitted that killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's remains were among those which had been found at the wreckage site and said DNA testing had confirmed the body parts were his. It is hoped his remains may provide clues on any medical treatment he was receiving . Investigators continue to search for remains at the site while scientists have started the grim and gruelling task of identifying the body parts. Forensic experts are photographing and 3D scanning each and every body part before placing them in a morgue until ID is fully confirmed . Forensic experts confirmed they have found the remains of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), who deliberately flew the Germanwings Airbus A320 into the mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday. He was said to have been suffering from a 'severe psychosomatic disorder' Mr Tsokos admitted that Lubitz's remains were among those which had been found and said DNA testing had confirmed the body parts were his. It is hoped his remains may provide clues on any medical treatment he was receiving. Scientists are now continuing the gruelling task of identifying the rest of the remains which involves photographing and 3D scanning every body part. Police have asked victims' friends and relatives for DNA samples, and experts hope to match them against the remains and material objects at the site. Professor: Michael Tsokos, a leading forensic scientist (pictured), said he will be haunted forever by the grim and gruelling task of identifying the victims' remains . Items with vital traces of DNA, such as toothbrushes, razors, jewellery and hair have been collected at the scene and given to scientists in Barcelona. Forensic officers have also been testing samples at a mobile laboratory in Seyne-les-Alpes - the nearest town to the crash site. It is hoped the findings will provide some clues which will help identify the victims. Some 15 teams of two people - a forensics expert and a mountain rescue expert - are working at the crash zone. Psychologists are in Seyne, from where the helicopter takes off, to support the rescue workers. Wreckage is not being removed at this stage unless it is essential for analysis. Families are also being asked if they can remember what clothes their loved ones were wearing when they boarded the ill-fated flight, in the hope the details could help with the identification process. They have also been asked about any distinctive marks, such as tattoos, their loves ones might have as well as their dental status and whether they wore dentures. Mr Tsokos, director of the Institute of legal medicine and forensic sciences, said it is hoped such findings will help identify the remains which will then be cross-examined with the flight's passenger list. He said each body part would be photographed and scanned in 3D before being placed in a morgue. Once the body has been identified it will be placed in a closed coffin ready for a funeral. He told German newspaper Bild: 'Radiologists with mobile devices will take CT images of body parts, so as to recognise for example, medically-implanted foreign bodies such as a pacemaker or artificial hip joints. 'Specially trained forensic scientists take [samples] of fingers and palms fingerprints and everything is photographed. Every little piece of fabric will be tested on the DNA so that it can be assigned to a particular person.' He said that within the next three weeks, up to 95 per cent of all victims should be identified. But, he added that it was a haunting task for experts, saying: 'These images will never go out of my head.' And he said the bodies will strictly be kept in closed coffins because the 'sight of battered corpses can inflict on anyone'. The recovery of body parts must be completed by April 8, otherwise decomposition will make DNA identification impossible. Meanwhile, a second black box is still missing following the crash. It comes as guards continue to keep 24-hour watch at the crash site, with teams sleeping on the mountainside overnight.  The guards have been on standby at the scene in the province in the southern French Alps since the flight crashed on Tuesday. Rescue recovery teams have been removing body parts from the scene and teams of French guards have been keeping 24-hour watch at the crash site (pictured).

Philippe Thomy, deputy chief of the High Mountain Gendarmerie, said: 'We sleep next to a cemetery for 150 people.' Prosecutor Brice Robin revealed today that an access road was currently being built for all-terrain vehicles to reach the site to help with the removal of large parts of the plane. Mr Robin said the operation could be completed by Monday night, with all body parts and remains being removed from the site within the next week. He also announced that a track for off-road vehicles would be established to the crash-site by tomorrow, for the removal of larger debris. Pope Francis prayed for the victims of the crash today after Palm Sunday Mass in St Peter’s Square at the start of Holy Week. Yesterday, it emerged that Lubitz was suffering vision problems prior to the crash and had sought medical help in the weeks leading up to the disaster. The 27-year-old was suffering a 'serious psychosomatic disorder', according to police, and had sick-notes signing him off work for the day of the crash. Families have been asked to submit DNA samples from items regularly used by their loved ones who died in the crash.

Police also found a 'small mountain of drugs' used to treat mental illness at his Germany flat and Dusseldorf University Hospital confirmed he had been a patient there over the past two months. It adds to the belief that Lubitz deliberately downed the Germanwings Flight 4U9525 because he was severely depressed and feared his pilot's licence may be taken away from him over medical concerns. However, Lubitz – who had notched up more than 600 flying hours - had been deemed '100 per cent' fit to fly after passing regular medical tests. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said all pilots undergo annual medical checks, but not special psychiatric assessments beyond training. He added: 'He passed all medical exams, all checks. He was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions.' A spokesman for Germanwings told MailOnline that under German employment law it was the responsibility of an employee to inform an employer if they were deemed unfit to work and stressed that it was unaware of any medical notes from Lubitz. 10.01am: Plane takes off from Barcelona 26 minutes late . 10.27am: Reaches cruising altitude of 38,000ft.

"A stray dog who befriended a team of adventurers on an extreme sports race in Ecuador has finally been freed from quarantine to start his new life in Sweden. Mikael Lindnord adopted stray Arthur after meeting him when his Team Peak Performance took on the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship last November. Arthur's heartwarming story went around the world after he joined Lindnord and his three team-mates on their endurance race through South America. And when they decided they couldn't leave him behind, they applied to the Swedish Board of Agriculture so that Arthur would be allowed to live with them in Sweden. Now, after four months in quarantine, he was finally cleared to leave and joined a delighted Mikael and his new family to start his new life. Scroll down for video . Freedom: Arthur has now been released from quarantine to begin his new life with Mikael Lindnord and his family in Sweden . Recovering: Arthur stayed in quarantine until he was in good enough health to be allowed to leave by the Swedish Board of Agriculture . Family: Mikael's wife Helen gazes adoringly at Arthur. She said: 'He will be loved by our small family and all of our friends' A delighted Mikael told MailOnline: 'He is really happy to be with us. When we came to pick him up he jumped around, gave us kisses on the mouth and lay down so we could scratch his stomach. He has been greeting everyone he has met during the day. 'We have been waiting for this day for so long and now he is here. Its a big day for our family and an even better day for Arthur. It is his first day as a free dog with a family who loves him.' Mikael said that he feels similar to Arthur in many ways and added: 'He is a fighter like me who never gives up. I could really see that in the jungle when he just kept following us. 'It is insane when you think about it. He jumped in the water when he thought that we were leaving him and was in my canoe for 14 hours down the river. 'Like me, he has never had a free ride in life, I have struggled, he has struggled, that binds us together.' Mikael, who collected Arthur with his wife Helena and daughter Filippa, revealed the family had found it difficult whilst waiting for the pup to be freed from quarantine. He added: 'Of course it has been a struggle for us all. We visited him often at the place where he stayed and I had tears in my eyes every time I left and heard him bark for us to come back. 'But they kept him well, he has gained a few kilos and looks much more healthy now. This dog has been through enough in his life, now begins the fun part for him.' And Mikael said Arthur revels in the attention that comes his way, adding: 'He is fantastic, really calm, almost noble in his way - that's why we named him Arthur, after the legend of King Arthur you know. I don´t think a human could have handled the attention so calmly.' Helen said Arthur would be made to feel part of their family and added: 'He will be loved by our small family and all of our friends. 'We have made him a space with cushions where he can sleep, and have bought food, trays, loads of toys and everything else a dog might need.' All delighted: An elated Arthur has now left quarantine to start his new life with the Lindnord family . Friends: Mikael Lindnord adopted Arthur after meeting him when his team took on the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship in Ecuador last November. Now he is healthy and recovered fully . When Mikael and his team first encountered the pup and felt sorry for him, they fed him a meatball and the animal started to follow them - and didn't stop. As the group of four navigated the gruelling final two stages of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship, the dog befriended them and was eventually given the name Arthur. At the time, Lindord said: 'I came to Ecuador to win the World Championship. Instead, I got a new friend.' Adventure Racing is a form of extreme sport that combines continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking over a successive number of days. The world championships held in Ecuador covered three diverse geographical regions - the Andes, the Pacific and the Amazon rainforest. He swam alongside them while they kayaked down rivers, dragged himself up hills during hikes and pulled through knee-deep mud during treks. Even when the team tried to get rid of their new member out of concerns for his safety - he refused to leave. The fifth member: Team Peak Performance met Arthur during the gruelling race and he refused to leave their side . All terrains: Despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of Arthur, primarily for his own safety, he refused to go. It meant when he got stuck in the knee-deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted, they stopped to take a break . Support: At one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle, so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food . Loyal: Arthur became a loyal member of the team and refused to leave their side on their trek . Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organisers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. They tried to set off without him, but as they left he jumped into the water beside them and started desperately paddling. Lindord, heartbroken by the site of Arthur struggling in the water, picked him up, put him in the kayak and let him stay for the rest of the journey. Arthur was originally scheduled to leave quarantine on February 5 to undergo surgery, but the request was denied at the last minute because he still wasn't considered to be in good enough health by the Swedish Board of Agriculture. The team agreed with the decision to keep Arthur in quarantine and also praised the quarantine's staff for doing an 'amazing job' with their new best friend. Today, as the family welcomed Arthur to his new home, Lindnord said: 'He is really happy to be with us. This morning when we came to pick him up he jumped around, gave us kisses and lay down so we could scratch his stomach. 'We have been waiting for this day for so long and now he is here. Its a big day for our family and an even better day for Arthur, it is his first day as a free dog with a family who loves him. 'He will be loved by our small family and all of our friends. We have made him a space with cushions where he can sleep, and have bought food, trays, loads of toys and everything else a dog might need.' Resting: When the team slept, devoted Arthur would also curl up and take a nap alongside them . Determined: Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. But Arthur swam alongside the boat and ended up being pulled in by Lindord . Greeting: Arthur offers out his paw to one of the vets as the team wait in the clinic for him to be checked over when he was in quarantine .","Mikael Lindnord adopted Arthur the dog after the mutt refused to leave his extreme sports team on a 430-mile journey through the Amazon .

"He's the son of a legendary footballer but Calum Best has become equally famous for his own love life - which is so prolific he admits to not knowing how many women he's slept with. Now ensconced in a long term relationship, the 34-year-old - who  counts Peter Stringfellow among his childhood mentors - admits he still doesn't know if he can be monogamous. In an interview with The Times, Calum paid tribute to his girlfriend of eight months, Ianthe Rose Cochrane-Stack, 24, but said that he is still aware of his own cheating 'demons'. Calum and Brtish model Ianthe Rose Cochrane-Stack have been dating since last year. Their relationship had been a secret, but was revealed after Calum starred in Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year . Promoting his new book Second Best, a heartfelt memoir of growing up feeling unloved and overshadowed by a brilliant but neglectful father, Calum insists he's trying to turn over a new leaf. After years on the party circuit in which he describes one of his lowest moments as involving 'hookers and coke', he considers himself reformed. He said: 'I sometimes think to myself, I was so driven by women and sex and naughtiness before! And now, the thought of chasing girls doesn't appeal to me.' The LA-born hunk said he despaired of meeting someone he felt comfortable sober with, admitting he didn't have 'sober sex' for several years. 'Peter Stringfellow looked after me,' says Calum of the night he was abandoned in a strip club by his father George Best. 'He took me under his wing. And he always has looked out for me, ever since' When he was growing up Calum was surrounded by stars. His mother Angie Best was a model and fitness instructor and after her marriage to George broke down she and her young son moved into Cher's guesthouse for a few years. As an adult, the handsome blonde went on to date a string of famous names himself, with ex-girlfriends including Kimberly Stewart, Lindsay Lohan, model Georgia Salpa, Girls Aloud's Sarah Harding and Elizabeth Jagger. Calum dated Bianca Gascoigne, daughter of  footballer Paul Gascoigne, after the pair met on  reality TV show Celebrity Love Island. He was also romantically involved with Jayne Middlemiss on the same TV show . After starring in a second series of Celebrity Love Island in 2007, Calum and Rebecca Loos, who claimed she had an affair with David Beckham, got very steamy on screen and were rumoured to be dating . Now he still feels unable to shake the legacy of his father, a brilliant footballer who was legendary for his drinking and womanising. Calum acknowledges in The Times: 'I know there are demons in there. I know I can go and cheat. There are some things to me that are my dad.' But he's determined to change and has voiced regrets about his behaviour with women in the past, in particular a picture that captured him making a graphic gesture with his hand in front of a woman's face which he said was very 'rude'. Calum has had a string of high-profile love interests such as Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding in 2005 (left) and another child of an icon, Mick's daughter Elizabeth Jagger (right) Calum says he resisted flirtations and come-ons from Celebrity Big Brother 2015 contestant Cami Li thanks to thoughts of his new girlfriend, model Ianthe Rose Cochrane-Stack . Calum, aged three, pictured with his mother Angie Best  and father George Best in 1984 before the couple divorced as a result of George's heavy drinking and womanising . However, the former playboy is still fending off cheating scandals and recently denied he'd had an affair with beautician Sophia Mia Wayne, 22, from Bournemouth, who claims to have hooked up with the reality TV star just 72 hours after he left the Celebrity Big Brother house last month. Calum added that during his time in the CBB house, explicit thoughts of his girlfriend were what helped him rebuff the advances of fellow contestant, glamour model Cami Li. But despite having never been in a monogamous relationship before, Calum is hopeful for his future with Ianthe Rose. 'I'll give Ianthe credit, I've never felt this strongly about anybody,' he said, and even added that after taking a recent holiday together he now feels more connected to her than ever.

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud Party scored a resounding victory in the country's election, a stunning turnaround after a tight race that had put his lengthy rule in jeopardy. With nearly all the votes counted, Likud appeared to have earned 30 out of parliament's 120 seats and was in a position to be able to build a coalition government with its right-wing and religious allies with relative ease. The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed the country for the past six years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud Party scored a resounding victory in the country's election . Likud party supporters react with joy after hearing exit poll results in Tel Aviv . Supporters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrate as election results come in at his election campaign headquarters . The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed the country for the past six years. Pictured are Netanyahu supporters cheering as the results come in . Netanyahu (left) took a moment to greet his wife Sara (right) on stage after reacting to the early exit polls . Recent opinion polls indicated he was in trouble, giving chief rival Isaac Herzog of the opposition Zionist Union a slight lead. Exit polls showed the two sides deadlocked but once the actual results came pouring in early Wednesday, Likud soared forward. Zionist Union wound up with just 24 seats. Even before the final results were known, Netanyahu declared victory and pledged to form a new government quickly. 'Against all odds, we achieved a great victory for the Likud,' Netanyahu told supporters at election night headquarters. 'I am proud of the people of Israel, who in the moment of truth knew how to distinguish between what is important and what is peripheral, and to insist on what is important.' He wrote: 'Against all odds: a great victory for the Likud. A major victory for the people of Israel!' Hopeful: Zionist Union supporters chant for victory. In the end their party won just 24 seats . Support: Norris in his YouTube video . Netanyahu received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star Chuck Norris, who said that his re-election was crucial for the safety of Israel. In a short YouTube video called Please Vote For Prime Minister Netanyahu, Norris said: 'I watched Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech before Congress, and I saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul. I also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the Israeli people. 'I have done three movies in Israel – 'Delta Force' being my favorite – and I formed many friendships while there. You have an incredible country, and we want to keep it that way. 'That's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only Israel but also the United States. You see, we the American people need Prime Minister Netanyahu as much as you do. Weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on America, too. 'So I ask you, please, for the sake of Israel and the whole Middle East, vote for Prime Minister Netanyahu on Election Day. 'And as far as those in the U.S. and the rest of the world, in this season of Easter, it's good to remember what the Hebrew Scriptures say about Israel and those who support her: 'Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: May they prosper who love you' (Psalm 122:1).' Herzog said on Wednesday he had spoken with  Netanyahu to congratulate him on his election victory. 'A few minutes ago I spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and congratulated him on his achievement and wished him luck,' Herzog told reporters. He said his leftist Zionist Union party would continue to be an alternative to Netanyahu's right-wing Likud. Netanyahu focused his campaign on security issues, while his opponents instead pledged to address the country's high cost of living and accused the leader of being out of touch with everyday people. Netanyahu's return to power for a fourth term likely spells trouble for Mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the United States. Netanyahu, who already has a testy relationship with President Barack Obama, took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign, staking out a series of hard-line positions that will put him at odds with the international community. In a dramatic policy reversal, he said he now opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a key policy goal of the White House and the international community. He also promised to expand construction in Jewish areas of east Jerusalem, the section of the city claimed by the Palestinians as their capital. Netanyahu infuriated the White House early this month when he delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress criticizing an emerging nuclear deal with Iran. The speech was arranged with Republican leaders and not coordinated with the White House ahead of time. In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama was confident strong U.S.-Israeli ties would endure far beyond the election regardless of the victor. Netanyahu will still need the support of Moshe Kahlon, whose upstart Kulanu party captured 10 seats and whose campaign focused almost entirely on bread-and-butter economic issues. He is expected to become the country's next finance minister.","Netanyahu's Likud party has earned 30 out of parliament's 120 seats .

"Battered and bruised, this is how 95-year-old Monica Bridle spent her last days. She could be mistaken for a victim of a mugging or a car crash. But the vicious purple welts, spreading from her cheekbones to her forehead, were not caused by any collision or assault. The pensioner, mother to a large loving family, had simply been tipped out of her bed by a bungling healthcare assistant at Southampton General Hospital. Incredibly, the hospital did not even think to tell Mrs Bridle’s family. Her daughter only found out when she visited her mother the next day. Monica Bridle, 95 (pictured) spent her last days alive covered in purple bruises across her cheeks and forehead after being tipped out of her bed by a bungling healthcare assistant at Southampton General Hospital . This shocking incident, a damning example of the problems at the heart of our health service, is revealed in a report by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. An agency worker attempted to change Mrs Bridle’s sheets without moving her – knocking her down the gap between the bed and the wall. And when nurses put Mrs Bridle back in her bed, they thought so little of the incident that they did not bother telling her family. The ombudsman found that the University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust, which was in charge of Mrs Bridle’s care in the spring of 2013, had not followed proper procedures during the incident, or in the hours afterwards. At least two workers should have helped move her, the incident should have been properly logged, and her relatives should have been informed. Mrs Bridle, whose family includes three children, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, died five days after the accident. She had been battling pneumonia for six weeks and her death was not linked to the accident. Mrs Bridle (pictured) had been battling pneumonia for six weeks and her death was not linked to the accident, but her large family are furious at the lack of respect with which she was treated in her final days . But her large family are still furious at the lack of respect with which she was treated in her final days. Her daughter Maureen Wylie, 60, did not hear about the accident until she visited her mother the next day at her nursing home. Mrs Bridle had been discharged back to the home without the family being told, and there had been no mention of the accident. Mrs Wylie, who still gets flashbacks of her mother’s battered face two years later, decided to speak to the Daily Mail in an attempt to stop similar incidents happening to others. ‘I feel so numb and angry,’ she said. ‘Those horrible bruises are my enduring memory of her death. ‘I remember very clearly seeing her face like that for the first time. I stood there shaking. I thought, what on earth have they done to her?’ The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman found the University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust had not followed proper procedures over the incident at Southampton General Hospital (pictured) Mrs Bridle was fiercely independent, a keen gardener and loving grandmother. She had worked with her late husband Charles at an insurance firm in Hampshire. After his death she had lived by herself in Lyndhurst, in the New Forest, only moving into a nursing home when her eyesight failed the year before her death. Health ombudsman Julie Mellor said: ‘This story shows the importance of following clearly laid care plans. It also highlights the effect poor communication in the health service can have on people.’ Judy Gillow of University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘We have unreservedly apologised to the family. In addition to intensive retraining and monitoring, we have introduced an electronic system for reporting falls and implemented much more stringent processes for communication with relatives.’","Monica Bridle was treated at Southampton General Hospital for pneumonia .

"An Indonesian minister has threatened to release a 'human tsunami' of asylum seekers towards Australia if the Federal Government continues to fight for a stay of execution for the Bali Nine duo. The warning came from the coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs -Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno - to remind the government who was working to keep asylum seekers away from Australian shores, Fairfax Media reported. It comes after Indonesian government officials took offence to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments about Australia donating $1 billion in aid to help recovery after the Boxing Day tsunami along with threatening to discourage visitors to Bali. Scroll down for video . The Bali Nine duo are spending their seventh night in semi-isolation at Nusakambangan in Central Java . Mr Tedjo, who is a former navy chief, said his government had been played a big part in stopping asylum seekers from making their way to Australia during a speech made at a Yogyakarta university broadcast on Metro TV. 'If Canberra keeps doing things that displease Indonesia, Jakarta will surely let the illegal immigrants go to Australia,' he said. 'There are more than 10,000 [asylum seekers] in Indonesia today. If they are let go to Australia, it will be like a human tsunami.' Mr Tedjo - who is an outspoken politician in Indonesia - added it was 'no big deal' if trade relations with Australia fell apart following the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman. Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno (pictured left with president Joko Widodo) is the coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs in Indonesia . It comes after Indonesian government officials took offence to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments about Australia donating $1 billion in aid to help recovery after the Boxing Day tsunami . He said Australia was the nation that benefited most from the agreement, not Indonesia. 'Australia will in fact receive pressure domestically if it stops its livestock exports to Indonesia since Indonesia is Australia's main market,' Mr Tedjo said. The minister also labelled Julie Bishop's earlier request to spare Chan and Sukuraman in exchange for three Indonesia drug smugglers held in Australia as 'unethical'. He said Australia needed to respect the laws of Indonesia. The pair are being held inside Besi jail in separate cells to each other as they await execution . This comes as the Bali Nine pair spent their seventh night at Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island' - as they await the outcomes of appeals made by other prisoners who are scheduled to be executed alongside them. Chan and Sukuraman were sentenced to death after they were caught trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms from Indonesia to Australia. They have spent the last 10 years inside Kerobokan prison in Bali. Chan converted to Christianity and became a pastor while behind bars. At the same time, Sukuraman trained as an artist, even teaching other inmates how to paint.","Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno is the overseer of political, legal and security affairs .

"A brave young son saved his mother and risked his own safety as he protected her from three masked attackers. Deonte Turner, 12, was with his mother, Barbara Whitehead, as they returned from her sister's house in the early morning hours of Tuesday. As they pulled into the driveway of their Detroit home, three men suddenly appeared and began cursing at Whitehead and demanding she give them money. That is when young Deonte stepped in to protect his mother, and one of the men stabbed him in the arm. Scroll down for video . Deonte Turner (above), 12, of Detroit , Michigan, stepped in to protect his mother as three masked men yelled profanities at her and demanded her money . The incident happened when Barbara Whithead (above) got out of her car in her driveway (in background) after returning home in the early hours of Tuesday . 'I told them we didn't have any damn money, but he just kept asking for money. And he kept talking really rough and in vulgar language,' Whitehead told the Detroit Free Press. 'And my son, he didn't like them talking to his mom like that.' That is when Deonte stepped in to intervene. 'He just told them don't talk to my mom like that. And then he saw it coming because he threw his arm up,' Whitehead said of the knife. 'He was like, ""My arm, my arm.""' The men ran off immediately after, and Whitehead, 44, rushed her son to the hospital where he was treated and released later that morning. 'He didn't cry. My son didn't cry,' said Whitehead. 'He was like, ""Is Mom OK?""' Denote placed himself between the men and his mother, at which point one of the men stabbed him in the arm . And while the mother is incredibly proud of what her son did to protect her, she does not want him risking his own safety in the future - even if it is to protect her. 'When someone asks us for something, just try to give it to them. Try to cooperate,' she said. Authorities are still searching for the three men responsible for the attack. Meanwhile, Assistant Detroit Police Chief Steve Dolunt has called what Deonte did for his mother 'extremely commendable.'","Deonte Turner, 12, of Detroit, Michigan, stepped in to protect his mother as three masked men yelled profanities at her and demanded her money .

"Bill Cosby stood up to hecklers at a performance in Baltimore on Friday night. At one point during the show a man stood up and yelled; '38 women spoke up and called you a rapist. 38 women!'

During his show a man stood up and screamed; '38 women spoke up and called you a rapist. 38 women!'

We are not here to argue. Let those people speak. We will find them and ask them to leave.' A few minutes later, the man was located and escorted out of the 2,500-seat Modell Performing Arts Center, which was notably empty. This as venues have stopped selling water during Cosby's performances, afraid someone may throw it at him during his set. One attendee said he only got tickets after a friend's wife refused to go following the recent allegations, and he was more there to see the hoopla surrounding the event than the actual show. This happened on the same day two more women (above with gloria Allred) came forward to say they were drugged and raped by Cosby . Outside the venue, over 30 protesters greeted guests as they went into the auditorium, along with two individuals who were there in support of Cosby. 'I have been sexually assaulted,' one of the supporters, Zeanyanna Johnson, told The Baltimore Sun. 'I know what it feels like. But the man hasn't been charged with a crime, and the man hasn't gone to court. The Bible says, ""Judge not, lest you be judged.""'

Whatever, the BBC’s James Landale was shown chopping vegetables with the PM as lunch was prepared for the Cameron family. The slinky Samantha, looking as though she was just out of some foam-scented bath, wandered towards the cooking area in a loose-fitting lumberjack shirt and announced that her husband was ‘definitely the best man for the job’. She added that ‘me and the family’ (did they not teach grammar at her public school?) kept him grounded. Kept him in the kitchen chopping carrots, more like. But what a healthy lot the Cams are. Did you see those lettuce leaves in the colander? No wonder he has lost weight, poor man. Can a man really run a country on rabbit food? This latest up-close-and-gooey film with a party leader – which came after the Miliband domestic epic disaster, and a little-noticed shocker with Nick Clegg and his parents – started with Mr Cameron on the touchline at a children’s football game in his Witney constituency. His son Elwen, aged nine, was playing. ‘Come on, Chads! Great save!’ bawled the PM, making sure the camera crew had a good view of him. Mr Cameron said that he felt ‘fit enough’ for another term of the premiership, and would be gutted if he lost the election. It was country casuals time. The aesthetic was one of Boden clothes and gummies and Chelsea tractors in Oxfordshire lanes. In the kitchen it was Belfast sinks and nourishing stews. Then came a moment from the Carry On films, surely. We followed Mr Cameron on a visit to his butcher. Chicken was on the shopping list. Past: David Cameron invited the cameras into his kitchen in Oxfordshire in 2006 - and commenters said that it now looks a lot more cluttered . Labour leader Ed Miliband previously allowed the cameras into his 'second kitchen' - an area for snack-making in his north London home . Mr Cameron: ‘I like the thighs because they’re very juicy.’ Ooh, missus. Kenneth Williams or Frankie Howerd could not have delivered it better. The butcher did not seem entirely keen to take part in the political promo’. Reporter Landale enquired if ‘David’ was the shop’s most famous customer. No answer from the man with the sharp knife and bloody apron (borrowed from the PM after his last reshuffle?). But Mr Cameron announced that one Jeremy Clarkson sometimes visited the butcher. So now we know where Clarkson gets his old beefs. Talking of the Top Gear presenter, Mr Cameron disclosed that his daughter Nancy, 11, had threatened that very morning to go on a hunger strike if Clarkson was dropped by the BBC. Oops. Tricky moment for Landale and his editors. But to their credit they kept it in. Mr Cameron said he had told Nancy that this was ‘not exactly Gandhi’ (a reference to the emaciated Indian Mahatma who used to fast in protest at British imperialism). Later we learned that Nancy had tucked into a hearty lunch, so her hunger strike had ‘lasted five minutes’, said her father. Longer than some election promises, darling. Kitchens update: Not to be outdone, ITV earlier in the day gave us an interview from the sparse wee scullery of gnasher-toothed Scots Nationalist leader Nicola Sturgeon. It looked about as warm and inviting as the sea off Aberdeen.","David Cameron invited the cameras into his Oxfordshire home before announcing that he may not do a third term .

"A couple have been forced to watch their home of nearly 30 years undergo demolition after an agricultural worker mistakenly dumped a staggering 150 gallons of diesel into their basement. Brent Merriman and Michele Lowary were horrified when the unidentified Pendleton Grain Growers employee unwittingly pumped the fuel into their basement in Pendleton, Oregon, late last year. Their property had used heating oil some years ago, and the driver had been confused about where to deliver the diesel, resulting in the costly mistake on November 24, a PGG spokesman said at the time. Within seconds of the incident, diesel had seeped into the flooring of the basement and destroyed items in the room, while strong, dangerous fumes had permeated the air surrounding the property. Couple: Brent Merriman and Michele Lowary (pictured together ) have been forced to watch their home of nearly 30 years undergo demolition after 150 gallons of diesel was mistakenly dumped into their basement . Now demolished: The couple were horrified when a Pendleton Grain Growers employee unwittingly pumped the fuel into the basement of their home (pictured before the demolition) in Pendleton, Oregon, late last year . One of couple's cats, which was caught up in the diesel, had to be taken to a veterinarian for help, while officials fixed  ventilation tubes through the windows of the basement, Union-Bulletin reported. At the time, Mr Merriman, 58, said he was worried the house he had owned for 28 years may have to be demolished because of the spill, which also led to safety concerns over the diesel's flammability. And now, his fears have come true after he and his partner were forced to watch workers in two excavators smash their beloved home and drop large chunks of it into a semitrailer. Mr Merriman, who is now renting a house across the street with Ms Lowary, told the East Oregonian newspaper that the materials filled two trailer loads on Thursday, the first day of the demolition. Affected: One of couple's cats (thought to be the one pictured), which was caught up in the diesel, had to be taken to a veterinarian for help, while officials fixed ventilation tubes through the windows of the basement . In need of help: In January, Ms Lowery posted a message to her Facebook friends, saying that she and Mr Merriman were looking for a home for their two adopted cats after 'losing our house due to a diesel spill' The agricultural co-op's insurance is covering the cost of demolishing the home and building a new, larger one there. Rebuilding, however, will not start until the site is tested for contamination. Following the diesel spill last November, the PGG spokesman said the company would work with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and contractors to clean up the mess. She added that it would take steps to make sure such a mistake is not repeated in the future.

Its trailer broke off, landed in a gully and spilled 5,000 gallons of diesel near a 109-year-old farm home. That led to the removal of 20,000 cubic feet of earth, and the demolition of the old house.","Brent Merriman and Michele Lowary's beloved home has been torn down .

"Dr Prashen Pillay, who accidentally prescribed 77-year old Joan Dixon a cardiac drug at 1,000 times the recommended dose, embarked on a two-year hellraising spree . A disgraced doctor who accidentally killed a patient after prescribing a lethal dose of drugs then went on a two year hell-raising spree around Britain, a tribunal heard. Dr Prashen Pillay did runners from restaurants, hotels and petrol stations and was even caught urinating in front of shocked shoppers at Morrisons supermarket. Despite being suspended from practicing medicine, the 43-year-old turned up at a London hospital London falsely claiming he was qualified to carry out treatment and attempted to move a patient. Pillay even turned up at a medical school in Durham where the deputy head found him addressing a class of students in the lecture theatre, Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard. A disciplinary panel at the hearing in Manchester branded his behaviour 'disgraceful, appalling, deliberate and calculating'. The tribunal was told Pillay had qualified from medical school in 2009 and in August the following year began working as a trainee at St Richards Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex. Tragedy occurred in October of that year whilst Joan Dixon, who had a history of heart problems, was being treated for a fractured hip following a fall. The doctor had accidentally prescribed the 77-year old with a dose of cardiac drug Digoxin 1,000 times the recommended level after he wrote milligrams instead of microgrammes on a doctor's note. After receiving up to 2.5mg of the drug - ten times thenormal dose - Mrs Dixon suffered a heart attack. She died 15 minutes later after Pillay failed to tell his superiors or make the cardiac arrest team aware of her deteriorating condition. When questioned Pillay, who had not written out the prescription in full as per NHS practice, said: 'Somewhere between my brain and my right hand microgrammes turned into milligrammes.' He also mistakenly prescribed an excessive dose of insulin to a diabetic patient- who escaped with a mild episode of hypoglycemia. At the fitness to practise hearing an expert witness said of Mrs Dixon's case: 'The prescription of 1,000 times the required dose is an extremely serous matter. Tragedy occurred in October 2010 whilst Joan Dixon, 77, who had a history of heart problems, was being treated for a fractured hip following a fall at St Richard's Hospital and was prescribed a lethal dose of drugs by Dr Pillay . The disgraced doctor was caught urinating on the floor at Morrisons supermarket in Sutton, London in front of shocked shoppers . 'Even a Foundation Year One doctor should have been aware of the approximate dose range and should not have prescribed this dose in milligrams. This error fell seriously below the standard normally expected of an FY1 doctor.' At an inquest in 2012 Pillay pledged to 'make it my life's work to ensure another tragedy like the death of Mrs Dixon never took place again . Following Mrs Dixon's death, Pillay was excluded from West Sussex Hospitals Foundation Trust and was later given an interim suspension prohibiting from practicing medicine. At an inquest in 2012 he pledged to 'make it my life's work to ensure this can't happen again' and told Mrs Dixon's family: 'I want to say sorry. I really liked your mum. She was hard work but she was funny and I have to live with that for the rest of my life and my career.' Despite his public pledge, Pillay went onto be repeatedly hauled into various courts around the UK and rocked up at operations or incidents claiming he was qualified to treat patients. In August 2012, he was given an £80 fixed penalty notice after he urinated on the floor of Morrisons supermarket in Sutton, London. In that same month he was £400 for using threatening behaviour in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and in September 2012 he fined £55 for doing runners from Penny Bridge Hotel in Lancaster and Alfredo's restaurant in Morecambe. In April 2014 he was issued with another fixed penalty for being drunk and refusing to pay a £28 bar bill at a Premier Inn in Stockton-on-Tees and the following August was fined £200 for doing a runner from a hotel and failing to pay a £30 taxi fare. In one incident Pillay wandered up to St George's Hospital in Tooting, London and relayed a fabricated story to anaesthetic staff that he was undertaking an official 'clinical observership'. He then falsely told a doctor his issues with the General Medical Council had been resolved and he was about to return to medical practice. In one incident Pillay went into St George's Hospital in Tooting, London and relayed a fabricated story to staff that he was undertaking an official 'clinical observership' In September 2012 the doctor was fined £55 for doing a runner from Penny Bridge Hotel in Lancaster . Pillay then changed into operating clothes, walked into the operating theatre and cannulated a patient - inserting a tube into the vein. He also maintained the patient's airway and attempted to assist with their transfer, all while he was banned from duty and not even supposed to be in the hospital. In a separate incident last year, Pillay went to the aid of a woman who had collapsed in Shepherd's Bush, London, but began concocting further tales to the emergency services who arrived at the scene. He falsely told police he was an anesthetist before  telling a paramedic he was an A&E doctor in Derby. When the paramedic who questioned his credentials he swore at him saying: 'Who's the one with the medical degree. What do you do for a 'f***ing job.' Dr Pillay was also fined for doing a runner without paying from Alfredo's restaurant in Morecambe . In April 2014 he was issued with another fixed penalty for being drunk and refusing to pay a £28 bar bill at a Premier Inn in Stockton-on-Tees and the following August was fined £200 for doing a runner from a hotel and failing to pay a £30 taxi fare . The deputy head of undergraduate medicine at Durham University School recalled how Pillay approached her claiming he had moved back into the area and had a secured a job at a local hospital. He later turned up for a lecture on anorexia claiming to be an expert on clinical skills and was already speaking to the students when the lecturer arrived. At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester, a disciplinary panel  found Pillay, who was not at the hearing, guilty of 26 misconduct charges and ordered him to be struck off . The MPTS panel said: 'The combination of Dr Pillay's misconduct and his convictions amounts to a particularly serious departure from good medical practise. 'He abused his position to gain access to an operating theatre, to a patient who collapsed in the street and to the students at the medical school. 'His actions showed a willingness to put his own interests ahead of those of patients, members of the public his colleagues and his regulator. He has shown no insight into the seriousness of his actions and the potential consequences.'","Dr Prashen Pillay prescribed Joan Dixon, 77, with a lethal dose of a drugs .

Sisa Abu Daooh, 65, was six months pregnant with her first child and living in a highly conservative community in the city of Luxor when her husband died. Unable to support her family as a 21-year-old single mother and unwilling to marry a man she didn't love, Abu Daooh decided to shave her head, dress herself as a man and seek employment - first as a brick-maker and then as a shoe-shiner once she got older. Scroll down for video . Most devoted mother: Over the weekend Sisa Abu Daooh, 65, (left) even met Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi (right) to receive an award marking 40- years of self-sacrifice . Free from the threat of sexual harassment, Abu Daooh enjoyed her life as a man so much that even though she has now revealed her true gender, she says she will continue to spend the rest of her life as a man . Free from the threat of sexual harassment, Abu Daooh enjoyed her life as a man so much that even though she has now revealed her true gender, she says she will continue to spend the rest of her life living and dressing as a man. 'My brothers wanted me to get married again...all the time they kept bringing new grooms to me,' she told Gulf News Egypt. However Abu Daooh decided she could not marry somebody she didn't love and set about shaving her head and purchasing loose-fitting male clothing in order to become the breadwinner herself. The decision shocked and angered her family, but Abu Daooh ignored their pleas to remarry and instead set herself up as a brick-maker. By her own account she was as 'strong as 10 men' in her 20s and 30s, but as she got older her strength began to fade and she started a new business, this time as a shoe-shiner. Sacrifice: Pictured left is a woman believed to be Abu Daooh's daugher. The mother (pictured right) was just 21-years-old and six months pregnant with her first child when her husband died . No other option: Unable to support her family as a 21-year-old single mother and unwilling to marry a man she didn't love, Abu Daooh decided to shave her head, dress herself as a man and seek employment . Abu Daooh's decision to live as a man was made purely so she could support her young daughter. 'When a woman lets go of her femininity, it's hard. But I would do anything for my daughter. It was the only way to make money. What else could I do? I can't read or write - my family didn't send me to school - so this was the only way,' she said. She had initially planned to give up the disguise as soon as her daughter married, but unfortunately her son in law fell seriously ill shortly after the wedding and was unable to seek employment. As time went by she grew to enjoy spending time around men and drinking at the local male-dominated cafes without suffering she kind of sexual harassment she claims she would have experienced if she was living openly as a woman. Despite this, Abu Daooh says she never actually lied about her gender and never denied being a woman if she was asked. She also says that a large number of people in Luxor always knew she was a woman and called her by a feminine name - and that the disguise was largely to avoid attracting abuse or prejudice from strangers or people who did not know her well. Now  Abu Daooh has been given an award for her sacrifice, with Luxor's local government naming her the city's most devoted mother. Over the weekend she met Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to receive an award marking 40-years of self-sacrifice.","Sisa Abu Daooh, 65, was six months pregnant when her husband died .

"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan yesterday accused her Labour opposite number of calling her ‘love’ in the House of Commons. Labour’s Tristram Hunt allegedly made the remark during a Parliamentary debate last week. Mrs Morgan raised the comment when asked about sexism in Parliament in an interview to mark International Women’s Day. Nicky Morgan today claimed she was condescendingly called 'love' in the House of Commons by her Labour opposite number Tristram Hunt . A Tory source said of shadow education secretary Mr Hunt last night: ‘He ought to think what sort of message it sends to young girls in the classroom to see him use chauvinist put- downs to one of the most senior women in government.’ In the interview with Sky News, Mrs Morgan also defended David Cameron against accusations of sexism, calling him a ‘feminist’. Mr Cameron came under fire in April 2011 after he responded to heckling from Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle by saying: ‘Calm down, dear.’ He later said he was ‘hugely sorry’ for the remark, which was taken from a TV advert. Mrs Morgan denied that the comment showed the PM was an ‘innate sexist’ and said he has a better record promoting women than the Lib Dems – pointing out there are no Lib Dem women in the Cabinet. Nicky Morgan said Tristram Hunt made the remark 'in the heat of the moment' during a fiery Commons debate on schools . She added: ‘I have to say the shadow education secretary said to me last week in education questions “Not my responsibility, love”. ‘I’m afraid to say there can be things that are said in the heat of the moment on all sides of the house.’ The heckle is thought to have come as Mrs Morgan confronted Labour over its tuition fees policy. Higher education fees are strictly a matter for shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, not Mr Hunt. Mrs Morgan also revealed she did not find the Commons chamber during Prime Minister’s Questions intimidating. She added: ‘Prime Minister’s Questions is a tiny part of the week... The work we do in our constituencies, our surgeries, helping people, making the case for our areas to government, that is something women are absolutely brilliant at doing. ‘The tone of the debate when you get women ... is very different. We need more women in Parliament.’ Labour last night declined to comment.","Nicky Morgan said Tristram Hunt made remark 'in the heat of the moment'

"Contradicts beliefs: A new study has revealed that daily weather variations have little impact on people's moods . It's long been the belief that rainy days have a dampening effect on people's moods. But a new study has revealed that daily weather variations have little impact on people's happiness or sadness - meaning we're just as content with the odd downpour as we are with blue skies. The research, which also found that people dislike their jobs more when the sun is shining, will come as a surprise to most weather-obsessed Brits. The study was conducted by Franz Buscha, principal research fellow at the University of Westminster, who monitored weather records with people's happiness. Mr Buscha merged daily weather data from the UK Met Office with individual level wellbeing data culled from the British Household Panel Survey between 1991 and 2008 and found no evidence that the often assumed relationship between sunshine and happiness existed. Speaking to the MailOnline today, he said: 'I found it quite surprising that nobody had done any work on this in the UK. 'I always hear people talk about the weather and that they are happy that the day is sunny instead of cloudy. I myself am one of such people! 'I decided to take a look and my initial assumption was that there would be an effect and quite a strong one. Good weather equals better mood. 'However, this didn't turn out to be true. There are some weak effects in a naive correlation framework  but when we go to a more complex multivariate framework (i.e. we control for certain factors such as age, sex, location, etc) all this disappears. The research, which will be presented by the Royal Economics Society next week, searched for correlations between happiness and temperature, sunshine, rainfall and wind speed. The research, which also found that people dislike their jobs more when the sun's shining, will come as a surprise to most weather-obsessed Brits. Above, sunbathers enjoy Brighton Beach in 17.5C heat last week . The study was conducted by Franz Buscha, above, principal research fellow at the University of Westminster . He added: 'The end result is that - much to my surprise - the effect of the weather on people's well-being is non-existent. 'Perhaps this is not surprising - when somebody asks you a question such as a) how do you rate your current well-being on a scale of 1 to 10 should weather really​ influence your answer? Up to one in four Britons suffer from seasonal affective disorder, with seven per cent of the population having full-blown SAD. SAD is also know as the 'winter blues' as victims feel their symptoms begin with the turn of the season into Autumn. In diagnosed cases, the symptoms can be so severe that they can cost people their jobs and break up relationships. The effects vary from mild - tiredness during the day and over-eating - to very serious, such as joint pains, stomach upsets, loss of libido and even aggressive behaviour. SAD is triggered by a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that rules our body's main functions, such as sleep, appetite, sex drive, temperature, mood and activity. When the days are long, natural light passes through the eye to the retina until it reaches the hypothalamus and stimulates these natural functions. But if there is insufficient light, they begin to slow down and gradually stop - similar to a car running out of fuel. In recent years, however, there has been growing evidence that there are many ways to reduce the chances of developing SAD or even to prevent it. 'People's well-being is driven by life events such as income, employment, health, family, death of a loved one, winning in the lottery, etc. 'It seems we are all smart enough not to be influenced by a bit of rain!' What Mr Buscha's paper did assert is that people's job satisfaction is negatively impacted on sunny days. The paper makes a clear distinction between daily weather and seasons. Mr Buscha did find significant evidence of seasonal affective disorder (Sad) whereby individuals become markedly less happy during the winter because of a lack of light. SAD is also know as the 'winter blues' as victims feel their symptoms begin with the turn of the season into Autumn. In diagnosed cases, the symptoms can be so severe that they can cost people their jobs and break up relationships. He added: 'One other thing to keep in mind, the paper talks about and short run weather variations (i.e. 5 days of rain type stuff). There is quite strong evidence that we all feel a bit unhappier in the winter.' Mr Buscha's findings may be seen as unimportant but levels of well-being are becoming a focus for the Office for National Statistics. The research fellow suggested that a future line of inquiry could be a study into extreme weather. He added: 'The top five hottest years ever have all been in the last 10 to 15 years. 'Quite extreme weather patterns are starting to appear. There is an interesting question about what the effect of this will be.'","Study was carried out by a research fellow at the University of Westminster .

"A Balinese woman charged with murdering her Australian husband is expecting the death penalty and her sons believe she probably deserves it. Noor Ellis has admitted a role in the killing of her husband, Australian businessman Robert Ellis, at their home in Bali last October. She told authorities she had paid two men to carry out the slaying. The couple's two sons, Peter and John, have revealed they are reconciled with the possibility that their mother could face the death penalty if she is convicted at a trial currently underway in Indonesia. Scroll down for video . British man Robert Kelvin Ellis (left), here with wife Noor Ellis (right) was found in a rice paddock with his throat cut in October 2014 . Both sons have refused to attend their mother’s court hearing. Instead, Peter’s girlfriend, Maddison McNeil appeared at the hearing and was shocked when a handcuffed Ellis ran to hug her and asked her to pray. ‘She’s still Noor, but she’ll never be the same and we’ll never be the same’ McNeil told Channel Seven's Sunday Night program. Both sons were questioned about whether they will regret agreeing with the death penalty for their mother in ten years. 60-year-old Robert Ellis's (left) body was found wrapped in plastic with his wrists and feet bound and was dumped in a ditch in a rice field near Sedang Village. Sons Peter (centre) and John (right) now face the loss of their mother too if she gets the death penalty for their father's murder . ‘If that happens, it happens,’ Peter said. ‘But we want justice for our dad no matter what.’ The 60-year-old's body, with wrists and feet bound, was found wrapped in plastic, dumped in a ditch in a rice field near Sedang Village. Among the eight people arrested over the brutal execution-style murder were the couple’s two former maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids. Another two suspects were arrested in November following a two-hour chase that ended in a violent confrontation. The men, both aged 24, resisted arrest by firing poisonous arrows and using machetes. They were finally apprehended after both were shot in the leg. Already in custody for his murder is his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids . If the suspects are found guilty of murder, they could face the death penalty . Sunday Night reported police allege the maids has been paid to remove Robert’s dog so that it would not bark while five men jumped him in the kitchen and slashed his throat, nearly decapitating him. Peter and John text messaged their mother to ask where their father was to which she chillingly replied, ‘I’ll ask him when I see him.’ When Ellis was arrested at the end of last year, she admitted to police and her two Perth-based sons that she paid $14,000 to men to carry out the murder with her motive likely being his $30 million estate. Noor’s lawyers have claimed that Robert was abusive and the hit men were only paid to scare her husband, not murder him. Police move Noor Ellis from her detention centre cell to an investigation room in the Crime Detectives Division of Bali Provincial Police on October 27 . Ellis has her handcuffs temporarily removed at Denpasar District Court in Bali on February 4 . Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife . Noor and Robert's son John Ellis (in grey shirt) arrive at Bali police station in October to visit his mother . Robert and Noor’s sons, Peter (left) and John (right) text messaged their mother (centre) the night he disappeared to ask where their father was . Police have also alleged Noor confessed to ordering his murder because he cheated on her 'often' and has claimed that she was possessed by a spirit or a monster and pushed to organise Robert’s killing by an outside supernatural force. Her sons, Peter and John Ellis have told The West Australian of the perils they face, not only of a life without their father, but potentially without their mother as well. ‘Mum felt like she wasn’t being treated well enough, she wasn’t given enough money,’ Peter said. ‘And her only option in her mind was to murder my dad.’ Adrianus Ngongo (pictured) is the main suspect in the murder of Robert Kelvin Ellis, who was killed when his Balinese wife Noor Ellis allegedly ordered a hit on him . Robert Kelvin Ellis was found dead in a rice field near the village of Sedang, north of Denpasar in Bali . In early January police reportedly handed a brief of evidence to prosecutors which claimed the victim’s wife paid hit-men 150 million rupiah, or $14,200 AUD, according to The Daily Telegraph. Officials confirmed that Mr Ellis had a UK passport and had lived in Australia before moving to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife. Ellis also has two other children from a former relationship. At the time of their father’s death, the four children and Mr Ellis’ brother John released a joint statement. ‘Bob was a loving and devoted father, grandfather, brother, son and husband. His loss leaves a hole in the lives of everyone he touched.’ ‘His work in business created jobs for thousands of Indonesians. He was a good and honourable man. 'His integrity, generosity and spirit is evidenced by the way the business community both expat and Indonesian have rallied to support us and show their respects.’ This case has come as two Australian drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, face the imminent death penalty in Bali which is expected to happen in the coming weeks.","Noor Ellis admits planning execution-style killing of husband Robert Ellis .

"Nick Clegg last night issued a damning critique of the use of ancient laws to prosecute journalists pursuing public interest stories . Nick Clegg last night issued a damning critique of the use of ancient laws to prosecute journalists pursuing public interest stories. The Lib Dem leader said prosecutors were ‘relying on 13th century laws’ to put reporters on trial and condemned the lack of a defence for those ‘uncovering information in the interests of the public’. He is the most senior political figure to raise concerns about the multi-million pound police investigation into tabloid newspaper payments for information, which critics condemn as a ‘witch hunt’. Operation Elveden, which began in 2011 and has cost taxpayers more than £15million, has seen dawn raids, large numbers of arrests and lengthy bail periods for suspects. But of the 20 journalists whose cases have come before the courts only two have been convicted, and last week one of those, a Sun journalist, was invited to lodge an appeal against his conviction. The rejection of cases by a succession of juries has led to MPs calling for the police and the CPS to look again at the remaining cases. Prosecutors have pursued the newspaper journalists and public sector workers using the ancient common law offence of misconduct in public office. But accused reporters have argued they are pursuing stories which were in the public interest. Speaking at his party’s campaign launch in Abingdon, Oxford, Mr Clegg told the Daily Mail the public interest defence was ‘just far too opaque in too many of our laws. He also called for a ‘proper review and proper reform’ of the misconduct law. He said: ‘I have long been concerned that the laws of the land are not clear enough on the public interest defence for journalists and other people who are covering information in the interests of the public.’ He added: ‘It’s just far too opaque, in too many of our laws, exactly what is the strength and nature of a public interest defence. ‘I would like to see that clarified in law, my party has always advocated that. He added: ‘The fact that prosecutors are relying on 13th century laws, that we don’t have an up-to-date definition of what a public interest defence is, shows the need for a proper review and a proper reform of the law in this area.’ Ten days ago, four Sun journalists were cleared at the Old Bailey of making illegal payments for stories. A former soldier and his wife were also cleared of the misconduct charge after they were accused of leaking the information. Free: Four Sun journalists were cleared at the Old Bailey of making illegal payments for stories . On Friday, the first journalist to be convicted of paying a public official as part of the Elveden probe had her conviction quashed. The former News of the World reporter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was handed a six-month suspended sentence after being found guilty of paying a prison officer for information at the Old Bailey last November. In turn, the officer was jailed for three-and-a-half years for misconduct in a public office and his friend was given 30 weeks behind bars. All three, who cannot be named for legal reasons, launched an appeal and the Lord Chief Justice ruled that their convictions should be quashed. He found the trial judge Charles Wide had ‘misdirected’ the jury on a key aspect of the misconduct in a public office offence relating to the seriousness threshold required for conviction. In his ruling, Lord Thomas Of Cwmgiedd also said that in a democratic society the media played an important role ‘in making information available to the public when it is in the public interest to do so’.","Nick Clegg said prosecutors were using '13th century laws' to try reporters .

"Families of Iraqis shot dead on the battlefield by British soldiers could sue the Ministry of Defence for human rights violations after a High Court ruling. A judgment stated that cases in which an Iraqi was either shot dead or wounded fall within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights Act. The landmark ruling could lead to over 1,200 claims, represented by Phil Shiner’s controversial Public Interest Lawyers (PIL), being investigated in UK courts. The families of Iraqi soldiers killed by British troops could sue the Ministry of Defence for human rights violations after a High Court ruling . Last night the Ministry of Defence said they were ‘concerned’ the court had taken such ‘an expansive view of the ECHR jurisdiction’ and would take the case to the appeals court. They also said it would likely encourage ‘large numbers of opportunistic’ claims which would have to be investigated at heavy costs to the taxpayer. Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said the judgment was ‘absurd’. He said: ‘The prospect that every time British troops shoot or shell an enemy in battle they can be put before a court is beyond parody and utterly preposterous. ‘How on earth are our troops expected to attack the enemy or to defend themselves knowing that every shot they fire could land them in court. ‘There are two winners in this judgment - our country’s enemies and the ambulance-chasing lawyers who will now be rubbing their hands together at the prospect of pocketing even more millions of pounds of taxpayer’s hard-earned cash.’ Colonel Tim Collins, whose eve-of-battle speech inspired the nation before the Iraq War, added: ‘I believe that these very lawyers have serious questions to answer about the abuse of the UK’s willingness to investigate such claims for personal gain and to that effect their credibility and motivation must be questioned.’ Colonel Tim Collins, former commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment, (centre) said the lawyers that have put forward the ruling have 'serious questions to answer' Under the ECHR, the state has a duty to investigate allegations of wrongdoing. To what extent the Convention applies to the activities of British armed forces in Iraq was previously not clear and has resulted in extensive legal debate. The Secretary of State accepted that anyone who was taken into the custody of British forces in Iraq had certain rights under the Convention. Colonel Richard Kemp (pictured), former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said the judgment was ‘absurd’ Claimants however argued Article 1 of the ECHR, the obligation to respect human rights, should also be applied to those shot on the battlefield. But the Ministry of Defence refused to accept that individuals who were killed during security operations carried out by British forces in Iraq were ‘within the UK’s jurisdiction’. On Monday, Mr Justice Leggatt, who is the judge designated to deal with the cases on behalf of the Iraqis, ruled Article 1 applied to ‘those test cases where the individual was shot by a British soldier’. Firstly, ‘because such shootings occurred in the course of security operations in which British forces were exercising public powers that would normally be exercised by the government of Iraq’. Secondly, ‘because shooting someone involves the exercise of physical power over that person’. He said Article 1 did not apply in cases where British military vehicles were involved in road traffic collisions. He did however state that in circumstances where a soldier killed someone during an armed conflict, the killing would be deemed legal, provided it was consistent with International Humanitarian Law. In those cases the family members would be unable to claim compensation from the UK. PIL represent the majority of the claimants and they told the courts they expected the number of claims by the end of March 2015 to reach at least 1,230. The legal aid-funded firm was criticised last year after the Al Sweady Inquiry demolished its claims that soldiers tortured Iraqi detainees in May 2004. Their claimants have been seeking orders from the court to require the Secretary of State for Defence to investigate alleged human rights violations. PIL said in a statement: ‘He (Justice Legatt) has ruled that in respect of all the 1,200 plus judicial review cases he is dealing with, all of the following stations are within the jurisdiction of the ECHR.’ A judgment stated that cases in which an Iraqi was either shot dead or wounded fall within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights Act (pictured the ECHR building in Strasbourg, France) An MoD spokesman said: ‘While the court has rejected all but one of Public Interest Lawyers’ attempts to expand our investigative obligations, we are concerned that it has taken such an expansive view of ECHR jurisdiction. ‘The judgment does not require any change to conduct of UK military operations but it is likely to encourage large numbers of opportunistic claims which must be investigated and litigated at heavy cost to taxpayers. ‘We will therefore be seeking leave to appeal the jurisdiction issues to the Court of Appeal.’ A PIL spokesman said: ‘This is a very important judgment clarifying the application of the ECHR not just to Iraq personnel in Iraq but for future international peacekeeping operations and situations of armed conflict involving the UK. ‘It is very likely that this important question of legal principle will be appealed by the UK Government and heard by the Supreme Court.’","Judgment stated that cases where Iraqi was shot or wounded are included .

"Shocking new footage appears to show lorry drivers in Calais ferry port savagely beating up illegal immigrants who were hiding in the backs of trucks. The video posted on Facebook by a Romanian driver on Sunday shows four men crawling out from a tight space in the back of a lorry. The first two stowaways manage to flee but a man dressed in a fluorescent jacket grabs the third  and violently beats him over the head while a security official's dog barks aggressively at him. When the last man falls on the ground, he is dragged away from the camera's gaze but the same driver is still filmed kicking the man as he lies helpless on the ground. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Footage filmed at Calais ferry port appears to show a lorry driver dragging away one of the men hiding in the back of a truck - and violently kicking him while his back is turned . Aggression: The video shows the same truck driver at Calais port yanking down the first two men who were also hiding in the truck - before he violently sets upon the two others . Shocking: He waits for the third of four illegal immigrants to exit the truck before he grabs and starts punching him. The man in the orange jacket appears to be a port worker who watches it unfold . Joint attack: He wrestles the defiant man to the ground as another man joins in and starts kicking him - all while the security official and his dog are seen walking away . The man who filmed the video checked into Calais on his Facebook account on Wednesday and Channel 4 reports claim the buildings in the background are confirmed to be inside the port of Calais. Hiding in the backs of trucks has long been one of the most common ways for illegal immigrants to sneak into the UK via Calais ferry port - while thousands live in camps built around the town. Drivers can be fined up to £2,000 for every stowaway found on their vehicle and the responsibility falls on them to prove they did everything possible to prevent such an incident. In January, a Human Rights Watch report said immigrants living there experienced regular harassment and abuse at the hands of French police. Illegal immigrants living a make-shift existence on the outskirts of town reported being beaten and attacked with pepper spray as they tried to hide in trucks to escape to the UK. Several thousand, most from Sudan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia, are living either in the camps or sleeping rough on the streets of Calais. Helpless: One of the illegal immigrants tries to escape but the truck driver subdues him on the ground and punches him repeatedly in the head . Assault: The fourth man to exit the vehicle is initially dragged away from the camera's gaze by the truck driver in the fluorescent jacket, who then kicks him in the back . Punished: Truck drivers can be fined up to £2,000 for every illegal immigrant caught hiding in their trucks and the responsibility falls on the them to prove they tried to prevent carrying stowaways . Record numbers of illegal immigrants are being stopped at UK borders, it was revealed in February. Senior officials said 36,000 unlawful stowaways had been discovered since last April. Sir Charles Montgomery, the director general of the Border Force, said 30,000 were found by British officers at Calais, while 6,000 were detained on UK soil. In 2013-14, the number caught was half that, at 18,000, he said, but campaigners said the number who actually reached Britain was likely to be far higher, possibly in the hundreds of thousands.","The video appears to show four stowaways crawling out of the lorry .

"The European Union hopes to strike a deal to restore relations with Cuba by the end of 2015 after cutting ties with the country back in 1996.

"Malachi Lindo, 27, repeatedly bludgeoned 51 year-old Phillip Steels in the street in Enfield, North London, after taking the ecstasy clone Ethylone . A law degree drop-out who battered a charity worker to death with a brick while taking a designer drug has been jailed for life. Malachi Lindo, 27, repeatedly bludgeoned 51 year-old Phillip Steels in the street in Enfield, North London, after taking the ecstasy clone Ethylone. The attack was so savage that when Mr Steels was discovered his face had been damaged beyond recognition and there was a gaping hole in the side of his head. Tesco worker Lindo had admitted the manslaughter of the father-of-four but it was argued on his behalf that he was not guilty of murder because he was suffering an abnormality of his mental functioning at the time. But following a trial at the Old Bailey, a jury last week found Lindo, from Enfield, guilty of murder by a majority of 10 to one. Judge Paul Worsley QC sentenced him to life with a minimum of 14 years behind bars. He said: 'It was a brutal attack. In the early hours of September 4 last year, having taken a cocktail of cannabis and ethylone, you attacked a complete stranger in the street and literally smashed his head in. It was an unprovoked and tragic killing. 'It is argued and agreed by psychiatrists that you were suffering at the time a drug-induced psychosis.' The judge described Lindo as an intelligent man who became the first of his family to go to university, studying law at Queen Mary College in London. This time last year, he was shadowing an Old Bailey judge, he said. But Lindo, who suffered from depression, dropped out of college and set himself up as a drug dealer instead. The court heard that on the evening before the attack, Mr Steels, of Burncroft Avenue, Enfield, had been drinking at home and had later gone out. He had been involved in a long dispute with a neighbour and was said to be angry when he left a friend's house and came across Lindo in Green Street. The attack was so savage that when Mr Steels was discovered his face had been damaged beyond recognition and there was a gaping hole in the side of his head. Tesco worker Lindo had admitted the manslaughter of the father-of-four but a jury found him guilty of murder . The pair got into a row and after being knocked to the ground, Lindo hit him repeatedly with a brick from a pile nearby. Mr Steels, originally from Co Sligo in Ireland, was discovered by police lying on a footpath with the brick lying next to his head. He had a large hole in the left side of his head and his face was damaged beyond recognition, the jury was told. Lindo was seen rolling around in the middle of the road 50 metres away with the victim's blood on his hands, prosecutor Anthony Orchard QC said. When he was detained by police, he became erratic and shouted: 'Take me to heaven, kill me now, I want to die.' Mr Steels, originally from Co Sligo in Ireland, was discovered by police lying on a footpath with the brick lying next to his head. He had a large hole in the left side of his head and his face was damaged beyond recognition, the jury was told . The defendant told police he had taken cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis and asked to go home, saying: 'I promise I won't kill again.' Inside Lindo's bag, police found cannabis and white powder hidden in fake cans of deodorant and drink. After he was arrested on suspicion of murder, blood and urine samples were analysed and found to contain alcohol and commonly abused drugs. The analysis also uncovered the presence of ethylone - a pyschoactive synthetic drug which has a similar effect to amphetamine and ecstasy. Ethylone is one of dozens of synthetic narcotics that have flooded the UK over the last decade. The most famous, mephedrone or meow meow, was implicated in a series of deaths across the UK which led to the law being changed in 2010 to categorise the drugs as Class B. It is a pyschoactive synthetic drug which has a similar effect to amphetamine and ecstasy and can cause euphoria and elevated mood as well as sweating, headache, nausea, agitation and possible hallucinations. It is classified as a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The court was told it could cause euphoria and elevated mood as well as sweating, headache, nausea, agitation and possible hallucinations. A toxicologist concluded that Lindo might have been experiencing the effects of ethylone and used cannabis at around the time of the attack. A post-mortem examination found Mr Steels died from severe blunt force trauma to the head which could have been caused by the brick. After the verdict, Acting Detective Sergeant Mike Stubbins said: 'This was a horrendous attack on an innocent member of the public, brought about by a complicated and confused individual being high on a cocktail of drugs. 'Lindo had been taking numerous drugs. He has stated that his mind started playing games and he felt he was in a parallel dimension. 'This is a tragic case where an innocent member of the public has felt the wrath of a young man whose life had been unravelling and who had turned to experimenting with illegal substances.' Ethylone is classified as a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.","Malachi Lindo, 27, bludgeoned Phillip Steels, 51, in the street in Enfield .

"It may have once made the longest commercial flight in history, but Qantas' first boeing 747-400 made its shortest journey to Illawarra Regional Airport on Sunday where it will now be the first plane of its type in the world to go on public display. After 25 years of service the City of Canberra plane was retired to an aviation museum based at Illawarra Regional Airport. After less than 15 minutes in flight, the specially numbered Qantas Flight ‘747’ was delivered to its new home with the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society ((HARS) where it will become the only B747-400 in the world to be put on display. Scroll down for video . Crowds cheer as the Qantas Boeing 747-400 lands at Illawarra Regional Airport . Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said donating the aircraft to the HARRS museum will provide not only a great tourist attraction for the Illawarra region, but also an opportunity to preserve an important piece of Qantas’ and aviation history. ‘It's graced the pages of the record books, revolutionised air travel for Australians, marked a huge technical feat for Qantas and carried millions of passengers on their global adventures and home again,' said Mr Joyce. The plane was so big that its two outside engines hung over the runway's edge as it landed . 'Our B747-400 'City of Canberra' is very deserving of a graceful retirement as the star attraction at one of Australia’s most prestigious aviation museums.’ ABC News reported that thousands of people gathered in and around the small airport to watch the landing, and they cheered and applauded loudly as the plane landed on the short and narrow runway - a distance less than half the length of Sydney Airport's runways. The plane was so big that its two outside engines hung over the runway's edge as it landed on Illawarra Airport's runway. The runway is just 30 metres wide but the aircraft has a wingspan of 64 metres. A pilot waves from the cockpit hatch of the Qantas Boeing 747 after landing at Illawarra Regional Airport . The Canberra left Sydney Airport and flew at just 4,000 feet and at a much slower speed than usual for its 15-minute hop down to Wollongong. Now the oldest aircraft in the Qantas fleet, the Canberra holds the record for the longest ever non-stop commercial flight for its trip from London to Sydney in 1989. Over the past few years, Qantas has been gradually retiring its older B747s. Nine of its newest jumbos, the last of which was delivered in 2003, have been refurbished and will continue flying into the future. Qantas pilot Greg Mathews talks to the assembled media at the airport after the flight . Since 2008, the Qantas Group has taken delivery of almost 150 new aircraft, lowering its fleet age to an average of just over seven years. The aircraft will join an impressive line-up of famed aircraft located at HARS including a Lockheed Super Constellation, Catalina, Douglas DC3 and DC4 and a Desert Storm USS Army Cobra.

"Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy said on Thursday that two agents who allegedly 'crashed' into a White House barrier in early March while driving under the influence merely bumped into a barrel. 'Previous reports of a crash are inaccurate - there was no crash,' Clancy told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee during testimony on the agency's budget request. 'The video shows the vehicle entering the White House complex at a speed of approximately 1 to 2 mph, and pushing aside a plastic barrel. There was no damage to the vehicle.' Clancy also told senators that the Secret Service was doing everything in its power to 'recreate' surveillance footage from the night in question that had already been erased by the time he learned of the incident. A U.S. Secret Service K-9 team works along the second, temporary fence on the north side of the White House this week. Congress may never know whether two agents who crashed into a White House barrier in early March were driving under the influence because it's Secret Service policy to erase tapes after 72 hours, a congressman has revealed . House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, pictured here at a Capitol Hill hearing on Tuesday, says lawmakers who were present for the Secret Service director's explanation of why tapes were destroyed were stunned. 'That doesn't make any sense to us' The newly minted Secret Service director's testimony follows the chairman of the House Oversight Committee's public disclosure on Wednesday that it is Secret Service policy to delete footage of the White House after 72 hours. Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz said Clancy offered up the policy on Tuesday at a closed-door meeting as an explanation for why he could only offer Congress video of the incident from two angles. 'I don't think anyone in that room could believe it,' Chafettz told CBS News Wednesday. 'That's just a stunning revelation that 72 hours after they make a tape they destroy it? That doesn't make any sense to us.' On Tuesday at a House hearing on his appropriations request Clancy admitted that he did not know about the alleged drunk driving or crash, which interrupted a suspicious package investigation, until five days after it happened. 'The fact that I did not learn of this allegation until five days after it is said to have occurred is unacceptable,' he said today in his prepared remarks. The lapse in notification means that all evidence of a crime could have been destroyed before the time Clancy says he was informed of his agents' misconduct. 'If it's regular policy to destroy them after 72 hours, why did they have two of the tapes, and where are the rest of the tapes?' Chaffetz had asked on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the Secret Service did not return Daily Mail Online's request for comment on the matter Thursday morning. And the White House's chief spokesman declined, when asked by Daily Mail Online on Thursday, to say whether he or the president felt it was 'appropriate' for the Secret Service to delete surveillance footage with such frequency. The spokesman, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, said he would withhold judgement until Clancy had a chance to explain himself to Congress that afternoon. Clancy  later informed senators that Secret Service kept tapes related to the bomb sweep and that was how it still had video of the agents banging into the barrel. The Secret Service head allowed Congress to view one video on Thursday but said he could not make it public 'because it may be evidence' and a widespread release could 'taint future court hearings.' 'We understand it's a concern,' that additional tapes were wiped, Clancy said, according to the Washington Examiner, and 'we're doing everything we can to retrieve those images and to be as transparent as we can be.' Clancy told lawmakers that the agency had contacted the manufacturer of the device it uses to monitor the White House as well as forensics experts. The two agents involved in the March 4 episode were Mark Connolly, then the second-in-command on President Barack Obama's protective detail, and George Ogilvie, a senior-level agent in the Washington field office. They were reportedly driving back in an agency vehicle from departing Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan's going away party when they rolled through an area outside the White House that was sectioned off by yellow security tape and hit a barricade. Chaffetz told CBS that the videos he did see showed the agents coming just feet from hitting the suspected bomb, which turned out to be a non-threatening package. The footage did not show what happened afterward. 'In terms of were they drunk or inebriated, can't tell,' Chaffetz said, because the tapes did not show the agents exiting the government vehicle or driving home after the incident. 'We want to see other tapes to understand that,' he said. If they even exist - and they may not, Chaffetz acknowledged at the time. 'At this hour we are calling on the Secret Service to provide those tapes so we can see a more full and complete picture.' Clancy indicated on Thursday that he was unsure whether the agents were drunk at the time of the accident. 'I do not have the ability to simply terminate employees based solely on allegations of misconduct. This is not because I am being lenient,' he said. 'While I am extremely concerned by the allegations of misconduct and the potential for alcohol involvement, I must reserve judgment.' At the House hearing on Tuesday Clancy conceded that some Secret Service agents turn to alcohol to help them deal with the stress of their jobs. 'We’ve got to find a way to help some of these people that are going towards alcohol as a coping mechanism,' he said. Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy testifies during a House Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on the Secret Service budget on Tuesday. Clancy admitted at that hearing that he did not know about the alleged drunk driving or the crash, which interrupted a suspicious package investigation, until five days after it happened . In addition to Congress, an an inspector general is conducting an independent review of the of the affair and whether a uniformed division supervisor ignored recommendations that officers undergo field sobriety tests. Connolly and Oglivie have since been reassigned to desk jobs until the Department of Homeland Security review is concluded. Clancy is a veteran of the Secret Service who President Obama pulled out of retirement to take over the DHS agency first on an interim basis and later in perpetuity after the former head of the security arm of the department resigned following a set of serious breaches of the president's safety. The White House said this week that the president was still 'absolutely' certain that Clancy was the right man to lead the agency, which has struggled to avoid scandal and operate efficiently throughout the second term of Obama's presidency. 'This is very difficult work, and going in and reforming an agency like this will be challenging,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. 'But somebody like Director Clancy, who has the skills and the character to implement these kinds of changes, will be critical to the success of that agency. 'And the President has complete confidence in Director Clancy’s ability to implement those changes in a way that will allow the agency to live up to the high standard that they’ve set for themselves, but also to ensure that they’re properly serving the country.'","'Previous reports of a crash are inaccurate - there was no crash,' Secret Service Director Joe Clancy told a Senate committee Thursday .

A device that can help GPs tell the difference between bacterial and viral infections has been welcomed by health chiefs as a way to halt the over-use of antibiotic medication. The hand-held device, the size of a rattle, contains a sensor that can analyse a nasal swab taken in the doctor’s surgery. It gives a positive reading within seconds if the patient has Influenza A or B – common flu strains in recent epidemics – or RSV, the Respiratory Syncytial Virus that is a major cause of coughs and chest infections. These do not respond to antibiotics, which target only bacterial infections. Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, says: ‘GPs have so far had to employ a certain level of risk management when there is no certainty of the cause of illness, and are under pressure from assertive patients to prescribe. ‘However, the fact that so few new antibiotics have been developed is also an issue, as is the willingness of patients to accept that lots of bacterial infections as well as viruses will settle down on their own in a few days.’ Sex pill cools hot flushes . A natural supplement known as the ‘female Viagra’, which is designed to help women with a low sex drive, has been found to reduce symptoms in women who are on the verge of the menopause. Lady Prelox, a ‘pink pill’ containing French pine bark extract pycnogenol, combined with rose hip extract and amino acids L-Arginine and L-Citrulline, was tested on 80 women in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at the University of Sofia in Bulgaria.

The results found that after a month of taking the supplement four times a day, participants’ sexual appetite was boosted by 60 per cent, and by 73 per cent after two months – compared with 40 per cent and 46 per cent in the placebo group. Women also reported that hot flushes, sleep problems and cognitive issues improved. The findings were published in the Journal Of Women’s Healthcare. Families of dementia patients can see their loved ones at any time of the day or night after a hospital scrapped traditional visiting hours. Instead, relatives visiting patients at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London will be issued with a special ‘carer’s passport’ to allow them to drop in outside normal hours. The move aims to help dementia patients feel more settled, as they can become confused or agitated in an unfamiliar environment. Jo James, the trust’s lead nurse on dementia, said: ‘Patients who have dementia or are vulnerable often rely on their carers to help guide them through everyday life experiences, including time spent in hospital. However, traditional visiting times do not enable carers to fulfil this important role.’ It is a part of a wider drive to improve care for dementia patients. Other measures include a weekly drop-in clinic for relatives and friends, and awareness training for all trust staff. Young diabetics get Angry .

"A US Marine accused of murdering a transgender Filipino woman after finding out she had been born a man, has had his $500,000 offer to plead guilty rejected by her family. Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton is accused of killing Jennifer Laude, whose body was discovered in a motel room in Olongapo City on October 11. The deal would have seen him admit to the killing in exchange for having the charge downgraded from murder to homicide, which comes with a maximum prison sentence of 20 years instead of 40. But the family angrily rejected Pemberton's plea bargain offer at the start of his trial today, which is proceeding as the marine has pleaded not guilty to murder. Scroll down for video . Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton arrives at court today for the first day of his trial. He is accused of murdering Filipino transgender woman Jennifer Laude in Olongapo City on October 11 . It is claimed US Marine Pemberton (left) murdered Ms Laude (right) after finding out she had been born a man . Flanked by officers Pemberton (centre) heads to court. His $500,000 plea bargain has been rejected . Laude's relatives said they had received a letter from the US Marine, who was 19 at the time of the killing, offering 21 million pesos ($468,000) in exchange for their approval to lower the charge . Prosecutor Emilie Fe de los Santos told reporters that Pemberton's lawyers had made an offer to settle the case, but no agreement was reached by today so the trial began as planned. De los Santos gave no details about the plea bargain offer. But Laude's relatives said they had received a letter from the US Marine, who was 19 at the time of the killing, offering 21 million pesos ($468,000) in exchange for their approval to lower the charge from murder to homicide. 'No amount of money could pay for the years I spent raising my child,' Ms Laude's mother Julita Cabillan told reporters. 'What they did to my child was gruesome. Just because we are poor doesn't mean we can't fight for justice.' Wearing a black suit, grew shirt and silver and green patterned tie, Pemberton was photographed being escorted by US soldiers to the hearing in Olongapo. Laude, also known as Jeffrey, was found naked with strangle marks on her neck having been drowned in the toilet bowl of a cheap motel room in the city's red light district in October last year, according to a police autopsy report. In rejecting the plea bargain offer made by Pemberton (right) the victim's mother Julita Cabillan said: 'No amount of money could pay for the years I spent raising my child' Pemberton, who had just finished training exercises between US and Philippine marines near Olongapo, checked into the motel with Ms Laude, aged 26, shortly after meeting her at a bar, prosecutors said. The prosecution's first witness, a bellboy, testified today that he saw Pemberton at the motel on the night Ms Laude was killed. However the proceedings were closed to the media, and scant details were only initially available via de los Santos. She said that, although Laude's family rejected the plea bargain offer, it could be revived and introduced 'anytime' during the trial. But lawyers for Ms Laude's family accused de los Santos of promoting the plea bargain, and separately filed a request with the justice department on Monday asking for her to be replaced. Ms Laude's death re-ignited long-simmering anti-US sentiment in the Philippines, a former American colony that still allows a significant American military presence via joint training exercises. Judge Roline Ginez-Jabalde is overseeing the trial, though both sides spent the past two weeks discussing the possible plea bargain. Pemberton is seen in a mobile phone picture taken inside the courtroom by the victim's sister Marilou Laude at his first hearing in December. She said she 'wanted to bang his head against the wall' Protesters chanting 'Justice for Laude' demonstrate outside the courtroom where Pemberton first appeared . Protesters jeer as the convoy of vehicles transporting Pemberton leaves the court after his first appearance . The Philippine Star reported that Julita Laude had been considering the $500,000 offer from Pemberton to downgrade the charges from murder to homicide. 'There have been talks on plea bargaining. It is possible for an accused to plead guilty to a lower offense, in this case from murder to homicide. 'The difference here lies in the number of years,' lawyer Virgie Suarez, one of two private lawyers for the Laude family, told the paper. She added: 'Indeed the Laude family wants nothing else but to see Pemberton being immediately convicted and his sentence be imposed. 'If this will happen it will do well if Pemberton will publicly apologize to the Laudes and to the Filipino people.' Lawyer Harry Roque, the other private counsel of the Laude family, earlier told members of media that their position is non-negotiable. Both lawyers have also expressed their belief that they have 'overwhelming' evidence and any judge handling the case will find the accused guilty. Pemberton, who was on shore leave after participating in the joint US-Philippine Balikatan military exercises, met Laude at the Ambyanz Nightlife Bar located along Magsaysay Avenue on October 11 and the two later checked in at the nearby Celzone Lodge. Pemberton (left) has pleaded not guilty to murder. Guards transport him to a military detention facility (right) Laude was later found dead by motel staff. Laude's sister, Marilou, had mixed emotions on seeing Pemberton for the first time at an earlier hearing in December. 'I wanted to ask him why he killed my brother,' said Marilou, whose transgender sibling was born Jeffrey eventually became Jennifer. 'I wanted to bang his head against the wall. I wanted to be angry, but I am also afraid.' Pemberton is temporarily detained at the Mutual Defense Board facility inside Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City while remaining under US custody.

The prosecution had earlier said the case is a special one and should be heard, tried and decided within a year starting from December 15, 2014. Both the prosecution and defense had agreed to a two-day continuous trial, set every Monday and Tuesday, starting today and running until September 22 this year.","Marine Joseph Pemberton pictured arriving for hearing in Olongapo City .

"A woman, who was 'red in the face and wheezy' was left to die on a grassy bank by her partner who instead went searching for magic mushrooms. However an inquest into the death of Sophia Helen Athanassiou, from Wellington New Zealand, turned up no concrete cause of death, it was revealed. The lack of information about the circumstances in which she died is partly due to the fact the 39-year-old's long-term partner Daniel Johnston initially refused to disclose some details, The NZ Herald reported. Sophia Helen Athanassiou (pictured), 39, from Wellington, New Zealand, died on July 9, 2012 . Ms Athanassiou was found dead in bushland above Wellington East Girls' College on July 9, 2012, but a post-mortem examination did not determine the cause of death. Mr Johnston was interviewed about his partner's death, and despite witnesses placing him at the scene he denied being in the area. Then in a follow-up interview, the man said he felt obliged to tell the truth and revealed he had left Ms Athanassiou wheezing and unwell when he went to search for magic mushrooms. Her body was later discovered near where he had last seen her laying unconscious, before he left her again after alerting people nearby she was in need of help. She was found dead in bushland above Wellington East Girl's College after being left 'red and wheezy' by her partner who went hunting for magic mushrooms . Mr Johnston is said to have left her side as he did not want to be 'busted' for having drugs in his possession, according to the NZ Herald. The first person to reach Ms Athanassiou described her skin and being grey, and believed the woman was dead. Mr Johnston said he told people in the area to call for help for her, before he left. Corner Gary Evans said at the inquest that the deceased lead a 'sad and somewhat lonely life', and 'the circumstances of her death leave many questions unanswered.' These unanswered questions are primarily due to Mr Johnston refusing to disclose what he was doing between 9am and 11am when Ms Athanassiou was found. 'At the time he left his partner, Mr Johnston knew that members of the public were arranging for emergency help. Ms Athanassiou was left to die alone,' Mr Evans said, before adding the police file into her death would be left open.","Sophia Helen Athanassiou, 39, from Wellington, NZ, died on July 9, 2012 .

"For fans of McDonald's breakfast menu who have dreamed of the day it was served outside of morning hours, the time has come...  but only as a test run in San Diego. Select locations will serve all-day breakfast with the partial menu featuring some of the chain's breakfast sandwiches and hash browns. The exact sandwiches have not been revealed. Scroll down for video . McDonald's will begin testing an all-day breakfast menu in April at select locations in San Diego . The test will begin in April as the  move comes in response to customers saying they wanted breakfast items outside of morning hours, according to the company. Depending on how successful the test is, the chain could expand the all-day breakfast menu to other markets, according to Business Insider. Last month, the fast-food chain began looking at how it could make breakfast available later in the day, said Jeff Stratton, head of McDonald's USA. Offering both the breakfast menu past 10.30am alongside the lunch menu had been considered logistically impossible, given the tight kitchen spaces of the restaurants. McDonald's even tweeted about the topic in February, saying it does not serve breakfast all day because its grills 'just aren't big enough for breakfast and lunch.' On their website in response to why they do not serve breakfast all day the company wrote: 'Here’s the thing: it comes down to the sheer size of kitchen grills. 'They simply don’t have the room for all of our menu options at one time — especially considering we use our grill to prepare many items on our breakfast menu.' The push to make breakfast available outside normal hours partly reflects how McDonald's is working to keep pace with shifting habits. In particular, executives have noted that customers increasingly want foods personalized to their tastes and schedules. Breakfast also accounts for about 25percent of sales at McDonald's, and is the strongest part of the day for the chain, according to the Chicago Tribune. If the test is successful, McDonald's could expand the all-day breakfast menu to other markets . 'We look forward to learning from this test, and it's premature to speculate on any outcomes,' wrote spokeswoman Terri Hickey in an email, according to CNBC. 'We're excited to serve our customers in this area some of McDonald's great-tasting breakfast sandwiches, hash browns and other favorites all day long.' McDonald's said on Monday that it was too early to speculate on any outcomes from the test. Janney Capital Markets had released an analyst note earlier and said that their industry sources had told them McDonald's planned to test all-day breakfast in the U.S. The analyst note was released before McDonald's confirmed the report. 'Having those breakfast items available to sell all day would also serve as a reminder to customers (and the media. and Wall Street.) that McDonald's does indeed have craveable food to sell,' Janney analyst Mark Kalinowski wrote.","Fast-food chain will begin test in April at select locations in San Diego .

"Coco the rottweiler has just weeks to live after being diagnosed with cancer. But she is making every moment count by completing her own bucket list, checking off must-do activities including running on the beach, eating a steak at a restaurant and sharing an ice cream. The eight-year-old's owners had taken to the vet after noticing she had developed a limp, where X-rays revealed tumours in her right shoulder. She was diagnosed with bone cancer and given only four to six weeks to live. Scroll down for video . Making every moment count: Coco the rottweiler is completing a bucket list after being given weeks to live . Messy eating: Coco's bucket list includes sharing an ice-cream and eating fish and chips at the beach . Her owner Symon Spencer, 40, and his partner Theresa Clancy, 42, decided to create a bucket list for Coco in order to 'give her the best end of life as possible'. So far, she has checked off items, including having a 3D scan, ordering a Big Mac from McDonald's drive-thru in a convertible and has even gone to work with both her owners. Coco even spent a day as a police dog with Miss Clancy, who is a police officer for Surrey Police. Mr Spencer, who works for the First Great Western train company, said the couple were devastated when they were given Coco's diagnosis.

Coco's owners Symon Spencer and Theresa Clancy (pictured on their beach trip) decided to compile the list to give their pet the best end of life possible . He said: 'I had a bit of a cry about it right there and then when I was told. 'I asked the vet how long are we looking at and in my head I was thinking 12 months, but she said four weeks. I was devastated. 'She said just last week that we may get another couple of weeks - maybe even a month - but all dogs are different and it's hard to tell.' Mr Spencer, from Farnborough, Hampshire, added: 'I was crying for most of the weekend after being told. 'Dogs are really clever and they pick up on your mood and adopt it, so she was feeling low too. I thought 'I need to snap out of this'. 'We came up with the bucket list idea that weekend really. We want to give Coco the best end of life possible. DONE . Get a 3D scan . Run on a beach .

'We went to visit my sister in Newcastle and on the way stopped at Code3D in Sheffield, where Coco had a 3D scan done - it took five hours but they sent me an email showing me the model and it looks amazing. 'It all spiralled from there really. That weekend we went to the beach and she had fish and chips, an ice cream and went into the sea which she hasn't done since she was a pup. 'She has really enjoyed it all so far.' The rottweiler, who has been prescribed painkillers to make her comfortable for the remainder of her life. And to complete her list, she just needs to try some sushi and have a cast of her paw print made. Mr Spencer, who has had Coco since she was a nine-week-old puppy, added: 'She is a beautiful dog.

'She's never shown any aggression and just wants attention. 'She will lick you to death and just wants attention, as long as you give her a little love she is happy.' He added he would love to extend her list to include other items - like meeting a celebrity or going abroad, but fears she is not well enough. 'I wouldn't want to add something and then not complete it. That would be heartbreaking. 'Theresa and I have been together seven years and I had Coco when we met, she would joke that I loved the dog more than her.'

Travelling companions: Coco spent a day at work with Mr Spencer, who works for First Great Western . Mr Spencer was told he could choose to have Coco's leg amputated and then chemotherapy or to put her down when her condition worsened. 'With Coco's medical history not being great and as with most large dogs, they do not do as well with three legs and she would not have a good quality of life,' he said. 'I asked if we went down that route, how much more time would we give her. The vet said only four to six months. 'I couldn't do that to her, put her through so much for such a short amount of time. 'The other option is to manage her pain and put her down when she needs it. I asked when would I know when it is time and she just said 'you'll know'.'

Other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs, hacked information and credit card numbers.

It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Full credit card details are not stored on the account, but a hacker can see the last four digits of a card number, as well as their full email address and phone number. From this a person could commit wider identity fraud, or sign into other accounts if the username and password is copied across other sites, apps and accounts. Courvoisier told Mr Cox they have 'thousands' of login details obtained from 'hacked accounts' and sells them for $1 each. ThinkingForward sells them for $5 and gives a discount on bulk purchases.

"A school sent 20 youngsters home because they turned up for lessons with their hair dyed bright red for Comic Relief. Stacey Clay, 32, was told to take her two children home and wash their hair before they would be allowed into lessons at the Henry Whipple School in Nottingham. Thomas, seven, and Molly, six, were among around 20 pupils who had temporarily coloured their locks, after being invited to wear red as part of a non-uniform day. Thomas, seven, and Molly, six, were sent home from Henry Whipple School in Nottingham after dying their hair bright red for Comic Relief . But when the excited youngsters arrived at the school gates they were turned away by staff who said the hair dye broke the rules. 'All the parents were saying it was ridiculous,' she said Ms Clay, 32. 'It was meant to be a day for charity. The sibling's mother branded the decision by the school 'ridiculous' 'A letter got sent out last week saying it was non-uniform day, wear something red - but it didn't say 'don't have red hair'. 'It was the school's fault for not noting on the letter that they would not have allowed red hair.' Keighley Britten, 28, also had to fetch her two children, Lan-i Comrie, four, and Kyeiss Comrie, five, after spraying their hair red. 'I felt I had to take them to wash their hair. The kids wanted to go back,' she said. But the school have stood by the decision claiming they were protecting pupils with allegies. Headteacher Cari Burgess said: 'Since I have been headteacher we have not allowed children to come in coloured hair spray, to protect their clothing, school resources and any children with potential allergies. 'A very small number of children still chose to come to school with red hair. 'However, following an explanation these parents - with the exception of one - chose to support the school and take their children home to wash their hair.'

"Los Angeles authorities say are working with the FBI to build a criminal case against millionaire Robert Durst's wife and she may testify against her husband to avoid criminal charges . Durst is currently being investigated for the shooting death of Susan Berman in 2000 and police say wife Debrah Lee Charatan, 58, allegedly tried to help Durst flee to Cuba before his recent arrest. The New York Post reports that Charatan, who married Durst less than two weeks before Berman's death, could face a federal charge of aiding and abetting a flight to avoid prosecution. Los Angeles authorities say are building a criminal case against millionaire Robert Durst's wife Debrah Lee Charatan (pictured in 2012 and 2014) and she may testify against her husband to avoid criminal charges . If convicted, Charatan could do up to five years behind bars. 'The wife is definitely in play, a police source told The Post. 'If she’s smart, she’ll waive [spousal privilege] and tell investigators everything she knows and put the final nail in his coffin — and then she might escape prosecution.' Durst was preparing to fly to Cuba when he was arrested on March 14 and police believe that Charatan was going to meet him there or help him flee. The Post reports that police are going over Charatan's financial records to look for money transfers or other incriminating evidence. Charatan was in Florida which is just 90 miles from Cuba when Durst was arrested in New Orleans. 'She knew this was coming and that [Durst] was going to be arrested and this was all going to blow up,' a police source told The Post. Recent arrest Robert Durst poses for a mugshot photo after being arrested for murder and detained on March 14 in New Orleans, Louisiana . On Friday, Millionaire Robert Durst's attorneys claim that he was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered Susan Berman in California, as well as drug and weapons charges filed in New Orleans. In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, William Gibbens and Dick DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed. They say he should be released. 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on. ... They're gonna find nothing,"" Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, told  KTRK-TV. 'I think Louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie.' 'Invalid arrest': Robert Durst's legal team accused authorities in documents today of arresting the real estate heir illegally, as his attorney blasted Louisiana officials for wanting a piece of the 'publicity pie' 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on ... They're gonna find nothing, Dick DeGuerin (pictured), the lead attorney on Durst's team, said on Friday . The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans. The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested. They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel. The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated 'to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama The Jinx. The six-part documentary concluded Sunday. Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings — that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001. Frail: Durst is on suicide watch at a Louisiana detention center . Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance. Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested. Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room. However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge. In the case, prosecutors could seek to play portions from The Jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay. While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing. 'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.' In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview. 'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person. In this video, he came across as a very sympathetic person.' Prosecutors are not commenting on the Berman case while Durst is still held in Louisiana, where he also faces firearms charges.","Robert Durst's wife Debrah Lee Charatan, 58, could 'testify against her husband to avoid criminal charges'

"Growing numbers of pets are being fed antidepressants to reduce their stress while left home alone all day, vets have warned. An estimated 80 per cent of Britain’s pet dogs suffer from behavioural conditions, with many linked to being cooped up in an empty house for hours at a time. Long periods of separation from their owners can lead to hyperactivity, obsessive-compulsive behaviour and anxiety, vets say. Growing numbers of pets are being fed antidepressants to reduce their stress while left home alone all day, vets have warned . But with people living busier lives than ever before, many pet owners are turning to drugs to quell the problems. Experts are worried people are feeding dogs and cats their own supplies of human antidepressants, or getting a prescription from their vet for animal-specific medication. Andrew Knight, professor of animal welfare and ethics at the University of Winchester, told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘The number of behavioural problems in dogs and cats, and even other pets, such as birds, seen by veterinarians is huge. ‘We’re constantly seeing animals that are aggressive, unduly fearful, or barely under control when they visit, although my colleagues and I do our best to put them at ease with gentle handling and tasty treats. ‘Instead of attempting to calm or even sedate our stressed pets with pharmaceuticals, it’s about time we started giving our pets the care and attention they really deserve. Only then might we truly be eligible to call ourselves a nation of animal lovers.’ An estimated 80 per cent of Britain’s pet dogs suffer from behavioural conditions, with many linked to being cooped up in an empty house for hours at a time . There are several licenced antidepressants for animals on the market, including Clomipramine, Selegiline, Reconcile, which each work in a similar way to fluoxetine - the human antidepressant which goes under the trade name Prozac. A recent report by the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) found that more than a quarter of dog owners leave their pet alone in the house for five hours or more during a weekday and that 250,000 dogs are never walked – leading to serious behavioural problems. Dr Knight said dogs need love and attention. ‘Dogs need to be walked, every day, yet too many are left at home with little to do while owners go to work,’ he said. ‘It’s hardly surprising many resort to barking and demolishing the furniture, in their desperation for attention and stimulation. Such problems are widespread within our pet population, and constitute a major, under-recognised animal welfare problem.’ The British Small Animal Veterinary Association said that medication should only be used after diagnosis by a vet.","80 per cent of Britain’s pet dogs suffer from behavioural conditions .

"Ella Woodward, a British health blogger who famously cured her rare but crippling nervous system disease by adopting a radical new diet two years ago, has made history in the U.K. as having the fastest selling debut cookbook since records began. Now, the 23-year-old former model has released her $16 food bible, Deliciously Ella, in the U.S. - with a list of banned foods so long it would make self-described lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow's eyes water - and already it has shot to number one on Amazon's cookbook list. 'Healthy eating doesn’t have to be crazily complicated, it can actually be so fun,' Ella tells Daily Mail Online of her approach, which consists of no meat, dairy, eggs, gluten, refined sugar, caffeine, or processed foods of any kind, and rarely any alcohol. Green goddess: British health blogger Ella Woodward, 23, (pictured) has become the fastest debut cookbook seller in U.K. history, and the U.S. release of her book is proving wildly successful too . 'My aim is to get people excited about eating more veggies, and seeing them as a delicious ingredients rather than a chore,' the brunette beauty explains. Ella's ultra-clean diet may seem unfeasible to most, but her recipes have won her a staggering following; more than 42 million hits to her blog, Deliciously Ella, a recipe app which shot to the top of the U.S. and U.K. charts last year, and now, a record-breaking cookbook. And while some might think that Ella's health-focused food strategy would fail to catch on in the U.S. - where more than two thirds of adults are classified as obese or overweight - Ella feels that her strong American following is down to that fact that health foods, and veganism, have become so incredibly popular, even more so here than in the U.K. 'I spent a lot of time in Los Angeles last year, and taking care of yourself is just so normal there,' she remarks. 'No one thinks you're mad for going hiking and drinking green juice for fun.' Fan favorites include Ella's brownies, which are made from a base of sweet potatoes, and her coconut Thai curry, a creamy medley of squash and chickpeas. Success: Ella has amassed more than 42 million views on her blog since 2012, and her new cookbook (pictured), released in the U.S. this month, has already shot to the top of Amazon's best-selling cookbook list . Watch and learn: The health guru, pictured on the Today show last week teaching Matt Lauer a few tricks, says that vegan eating can be 'so much more than nut roasts' In the U.K, Ella - the daughter of a supermarket heiress and a politician - has been hailed as 'the new Nigella Lawson', but beyond their shared success, and their very pretty faces, Ella admits that her food philosophy couldn't be further from that of Ms Lawson's. 'It’s a gigantic compliment, and a huge honor to know that people see me in that way,' Ella says. 'And it’s true - our philosophies are very different - but we both love food a lot.' And while Ella may eschew butter, cream, bacon and all the usual mainstream indulgences, eating vegan, she says, is 'so much more than nut roasts'. 'It can be beautiful, delicious, satisfying, comforting dishes,' she says. 'From butternut squash risotto to creamy coconut porridge, baked falafels, pesto pasta, chocolate cookies, avocado chocolate mousse and berry scones with coconut cream.' Health machine: A self-confessed former 'sugar monster', who used to gorge on candy and fast food, Ella now eschews meat, dairy, eggs, gluten, refined sugar, processed food, caffeine, and rarely drinks alcohol . Healed: Ella turned her unhealthy ways around 18 months ago, in a last-ditch attempt to cure herself of a sudden, chronic illness, postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTs) A self-confessed former 'sugar monster', who used to gorge on candy and fast food, Ella turned her unhealthy ways around 18 months ago, in a last-ditch attempt to cure herself of a sudden, chronic illness: postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTs). The little-understood disease affects the nervous system, and, quite out-of-the-blue, left her in constant pain, sleeping for 16 hours a day, riddled with infections and so bloated she had to wear her father’s clothes. After giving up all animal products and all processed food, however, Ella managed to heal herself, where months in hospital and endless courses of medication failed to do so. 'I haven’t felt symptoms returning since I came off my medication, which is incredible,' she says. 'I’m conscious of the way I live and do things every day that nourish my body. I eat well, I work out, I try to manage stress, I get a good sleep in, and together that does wonders.' Holistic lifestyle: 'I eat well, I work out, I try to manage stress, I get a good sleep in, and together that does wonders,' says Ella, pictured in London at Red's Women of the Year Awards in September . One criticism Ella does face, however, is how expensive her ingredients are. Many of her recipes require large quantities of expensive nuts, medjool dates and obscure ingredients like psyllium husk powder and maca, for example. 'The baking part can be expensive, but I don’t bake that regularly,' she says. 'The things I cook and eat on a regular basis are really inexpensive. 'I eat mostly seasonal veggies, beans, brown rice and homemade hummus. Then I make big batches of soups and recipes, like my chili and curry, which, again, are pretty inexpensive, and they’re great things to stock your freezer with.' Healthy spin: One of Ella's most famous recipes is for her brownies (left), which are made from a base of sweet potatoes. Pictured (right), the cover of her newly-released cookbook . Asked whether any aspect of her choice to go vegan was related to ethics, or animal welfare, Ella, who wears fur, said no. 'I always say that anyone should adapt my recipes to make it work for them, and if that means adding salmon or chicken, then I’m very supportive of that,' she explains, adding that she has 'learned a lot' about the meat and dairy industry recently, and does see problems with it. Ella is currently working on two further cookbooks, with plans to spend more time in the U.S. in the near future. In the meantime, her favorite recipes from her debut book? 'The coconut Thai curry, the cacao and almond butter fudge, and the beetroot and chocolate cake with a coconut frosting,' she says. 'Awesome, and so easy to make.'","Ella's debut cookbook, Deliciously Ella, $16, broke all sales records in the U.K. and is proving hugely popular in the U.S. too .

"Police officers must record the stops they carry out on motorists amid fears they are unfairly targeting ethnic drivers, a watchdog has said. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) made the recommendation after finding that black and minority ethnic motorists were disproportionately affected by vehicle stops. Forces are currently not required to make official records of vehicle stops. But a survey by the police watchdog found 7-8 per cent of white drivers were stopped in the last two years, compared to up to 14 per cent of black drivers. HMIC has recommended that all vehicle stops are officially recorded. Police are not currently required to do so but the watchdog found 7-8 per cent of white drivers were stopped in the last two years, compared to up to 14 per cent of black drivers . But white drivers were more likely to be arrested, given a fixed penalty notice, be summonsed or prosecuted – suggesting ethnic motorists were ‘more likely to be stopped for no reason’, the report found. Police made no attempt to assess if they were using their powers fairly, it said. Police forces have also made ‘disappointingly slow progress’ in improving their use of stop and search powers, said HMIC. Government inspectors warned in 2013 that more than a quarter of police stop and searches were unlawful – equivalent to 250,000 of the one million people every year being subjected to searches which did not stick to the rules. Legally nobody should be stopped unless there is 'reasonable suspicion' they are guilty of carrying drugs, weapons or intending to commit a crime. But the latest HMIC report said good progress had been made on only one of 10 recommendations inspectors made in 2013 - the use of technology to record stop and search encounters between the police and a suspect. HMIC Chief Stephen Otter said: ‘Too many police leaders and officers still don't seem to understand the impact that the use of powers to stop and search people can have on the lives of many people, especially young people and those who are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. ‘This is disappointing because getting it wrong can lead to resentment, anger and, in time, a loss of trust in the police.’ He said fury about unfair and disproportionate stop and searches was ‘one trigger for major disorder’. Mr Otter said police forces might be falling short because they were made up overwhelmingly of white officers. ‘If you are a black officer it might be easier to empathise because it might have happened to you; it is much less likely to happen if you are white,’ he said. ‘Is it active discrimination? Is it racial profiling? There's a lot of research that suggests that's the case.’ A survey of more than 12,000 police officers found more than a third of police officers felt under pressure to carry out fewer stop and searches . He said that despite nearly two decades elapsing since the publication of the McPherson Report, which labelled the police ‘institutionally racist’ over the murder of London student Stephen Lawrence in an attack in 1993, officers were not using stop and search ‘effectively and fairly after all this time’. He said it was ‘difficult to look’ Stephen’s mother Doreen Lawrence, made a Life Peer in 2013, ‘in the face because of the lack of progress that has been made in this area when it is pretty clear much more needs to be done.’ HMIC Chief Stephen Otter said: ‘Too many police leaders and officers still don't seem to understand the impact that the use of powers to stop and search' A survey of more than 12,000 police officers found that more than a third felt under pressure to carry out fewer stop and searches, while a quarter said they were under pressure to stop using the power entirely. The study also found that a ‘small minority’ of officers were arresting people in order to search them so they avoided the ‘increased scrutiny’ of stop and search powers, HMIC said. The watchdog also found in their inspection a ‘surprising lack of interest’ among senior police officers about the way strip-searches are carried out, in particular on children as young as 12 and other vulnerable people. The lack of official records means it is not clear whether the way these powers are used by the police is ‘lawful, necessary and appropriate’. Chief Superintendent Gavin Thomas, vice-president of the Police Superintendents’ Association of England and Wales, said: ‘Stop and search is an important part of policing. It helps catch criminals, protect people from harm and provide reassurance to communities who are blighted by crime. But it is a power that must be used responsibly if we are to keep the confidence of the communities in which it is being used.’ The Home Office launched a best use of stop and search scheme last year, which was part of a range of measures aimed at slashing the overall use of the controversial practice.","HMIC makes recommendation after finding minorities overly affected .

"Residents can now nominate a neighbour to receive their parcels so they never miss a delivery, Royal Mail announced yesterday. The move could reduce the number of ‘red cards’ which land on doormats to tell householders a package has been returned to the delivery office. Postmen already attempt to deliver parcels to people’s neighbours if they are out. But the new service means they can now deliver to a specific friend who lives nearby, in the recipient’s absence. Residents can now nominate a neighbour to receive their parcels so they never miss a delivery, Royal Mail announced yesterday (file picture) It means people can choose a neighbour who they know well, or who is often in during the day, to sign for a parcel or receive a delivery which will not fit through the letter box. The price of first and second class stamps rose by a penny each yesterday. A first class stamp now costs 63p while second class is 54p – more than double what it was ten years ago. Sending a large letter has gone up by 2p to 95p for first class and by 1p to 74p for second class. Royal Mail, which was privatised in 2013, said it had ‘thought carefully about the impact on customers’ because of ‘recent tough economic conditions’. However critics fear the increase will hit small businesses which depend on the postal service. The price rise is 1.6 per cent for a first class stamp, and 1.9 per cent for second class. John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘If you’re a business that relies heavily on the postal service, increases in prices won’t be welcomed. ‘Businesses affected will have to decide whether to absorb it or pass it on to their customers.’ Royal Mail said the ‘Nominate a Neighbour’ scheme would be more convenient for householders and ‘improve first-time delivery’. Sue Whalley, of Royal Mail, said: ‘This new initiative is great news for our customers as it offers further choice and convenience if there is no one at home. ‘For our postmen and women it means that they are even more likely to deliver parcels and letters first time rather than having to take items back to the office. First-time delivery of parcels and signed-for items is high in Royal Mail and in the trial delivery offices this improved further.’ Since 2012 Royal Mail has left parcels with neighbours if the recipient is not in. But critics feared this meant valuable packages could be left with untrustworthy or unfamiliar neighbours. Now customers can nominate a preferred neighbour by visiting their local delivery office, filling out a short form and presenting proof of their identity. Postmen will try to deliver to this neighbour in the first instance, before trying other addresses nearby. It is unclear if using the nominate service, however, will mean that households are now responsible if their parcel then goes missing. Under the old system, when postmen knocked on several neighbours’ doors, Royal Mail was still responsible if the parcel later went astray. Special delivery items and international parcels requiring a signature are excluded from the scheme.","Postmen can now deliver to a specific friends who lives nearby to recipient .

"The happiest year of our life begins when we turn 34 because it's when we start ticking off boxes such as tying the knot, having children and making strides in a chosen career, according to a survey. A study of 2,000 over-40s asked people to reflect on their levels of happiness through different stages of life and compiled the key factors for each decade. Results showed age 34 was the happiest year for most people on average. A study of 2,000 over-40s asked people to reflect on their levels of happiness through different stages of life and found 34 was the age when people were at their happiest in every aspect of their lives . The study also found it is the age when we are most comfortable in ourselves, earn enough money to get on the property ladder, meet monthly payments with confidence and start to enjoy the finer things in life. Meanwhile, those who thought their 20s were the happiest cited the freedom, social life and career progression they enjoyed in that decade. Those who chose a year in their 40s as their happiest enjoyed watching the children grow up and getting a bigger home, the study by home security specialists Yale found. People who chose their 50s said work winding down, the children leaving home, paying off the mortgage and getting a new start after a divorce as their happy factors. Getting on the property ladder was a recurring theme throughout the study and the age a person gets their first home often correlated with their happiest year . 1. I was young and physically fit . 2. I had less responsibility/more freedom . 3. I was comfortable with my appearance . 4. I got married . 5. My family were still around . 6. All my money was spent on myself . 7. I met someone I fell in love with . 8. I had children . 9. I had a wider social circle . 10. I partied a lot . 11. I travelled a lot . 12. I had flings/went on dates/played the field . 1.

I moved abroad . 12. My family members got married . The study also found those choosing a year in their 60s as their happiest year so far said the ability to retire, travel more and finally relax as crucial boosts to a positive outlook. A key reason behind being most happy included 'meeting someone I fell in love with' which appeared in the happy moments for 20s, 30s and 40s, while 'getting married' appears in every decade. People were most likely to state that they had become happier as they had grown older rather than the other way round, results showed. 1. I was comfortable financially and emotionally . 2. Work was winding down . 3. Pay off the mortgage . 4. I went travelling . 5. I became a grandparent . 6. Children moved out . 7. Got divorced, started fresh . 8. Got married or re-married . 9.

Children moved out . 14. Became stay-at-home . People cited having children and grandchildren as one of their 'happy factors' throughout each decade . Overall people reflected on their lives happily, with 47 per cent able to say most of their life had been happy so far. And 43 per cent said their life had been an equal balance of happy and rougher times, while one in ten unfortunately looked back on their life as mostly unhappy. Nigel Fisher, MD of home security Yale, said: 'With the average age we're most happiest coming out in the mid-thirties, it suggests that the feeling of being settled in your work and personal life while still looking to the future is important. 'Getting on the property ladder was a recurring theme throughout the study and the age a person gets their first home often correlated with the happiest year they chose. 'That sense of a permanent home and place to create new and happy memories is a big part of the study and shows the importance of a secure home environment in making us content with life.' 1.

"Thai authorities have fined an Australian holidaymaker who drunkenly stuffed two raw prawns into his pocket at a seafood restaurant on the picturesque island of Phuket. These embarrassing snaps show the moment 27-year-old Jacob Saveisberg was forced to pose with police officers after his arrest. In one of the photos, Mr Saveisberg points at the tiger prawns as they are held by an officer, while two other photos show an officer dangling the crustaceans in front of the tourist’s face. Australian tourist Jacob Saveisberg, 27, was forced to pose with police officers after his arrest . A police officer in the town of Patong dangles two tiger prawns in front of Jacob Saveisberg's face . A restaurant employee and police officers pursued Mr Saveisberg through the streets of Patong after he stole the prawns early Saturday morning, Phuketwan reported. He was arrested on a party street and taken to a police station, where officers found the prawns in his pocket. A police officer told the Thai website that the theft occurred as Mr Saveisberg walked along a beach road where the Tropica Bungalow Hotel’s restaurant displays its seafood for passers-by. Another officer, Lt Thongpael Khurhom, told the Phuket Gazette: ‘He was taken to the Patong Police Station, where he confessed that he stole the prawns because he was very drunk.’ Police said the Australian tourist slipped the tiger prawns into his pocket and walked away . A police officer said the holidaymaker 'confessed that he stole the prawns because he was very drunk' Jacob Saveisberg avoided a charge of theft and was fined 500 baht  for being drunk and disorderly . Because the restaurant did not file a formal complaint police decided not to charge him with theft, which carries a jail sentence and higher fine for those convicted. Instead police handed him a fine of 500 baht (AUS$20 or £10) for being drunk and disorderly, and allowed him to leave. Restaurant manager Aruni Mahasena, quoted by the Phuket Gazette, told the police: ‘The man walked through our restaurant and took two prawns. Our staff asked him to put them back, but he refused and then disappeared onto Soi Bangla.’","Jacob Saveisberg was forced to pose with police officers after his arrest .

"If you can't stand the heat, get out of your second kitchen. Ed Miliband today sought to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements, insisting he prefers the 'functional kitchenette' where he was seen posing for TV cameras. The Labour leader, who has repeatedly insisted he is not interested in photo opportunities,was filmed sipping tea at home with his wife Justine in a modest kitchen at his £2million North London home. Now it has emerged that the image of the Labour leader as a man of the people with a run-of-the-mill home was not all it appeared. For Mr Miliband actually lives in a house with two kitchens. The godmother to one of Mr Miliband's children tonight revealed that the kitchen Ed Miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a 'functional kitchenette' next to the family's sitting room . Jenni Russell, a newspaper columnist, said the kitchen Mr Miliband was pictured in was used for 'tea and quick snacks' and insisted the family's main kitchen was 'lovely' The poky room the couple were pictured in, albeit with an oven and hob, was revealed last night by a family friend to be a 'functional kitchenette' for 'tea and quick snacks'. The revelation opened up the Labour leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is, even though his home is reputed to be worth £2.5million. And 'two kitchens' Miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over John Prescott for having 'two Jags'. Today Mr Miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing. 'The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,' he told the Birmingham Mail . 'And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.' Pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen, Mr Miliband added: 'This is the kitchen Justine and I use.' He joked: 'I think Justine would probably say she wishes I'd spend more time in the kitchen.' Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of Tory chief whip Michael Gove, wrote an article in yesterday's paper sympathising over the 'forlorn' kitchen as depicted on BBC News on Tuesday evening. She wrote: 'Very rarely do I feel sorry for Ed Miliband, but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen, staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue-and-white mug, part of me wanted to rush home from work, sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home-made brownies. 'Surely that can't really be Ed and Justine's kitchen? All that lovely huge, fancy house, and that is where they do their cooking? 'I hope for their sake that it's actually their utility room, and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their £2million-plus townhouse in North London's trendy Kentish Town look less fabulous and to bolster Ed's man-o'-the-people image.' In his Christmas card last year, Mr Miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen . Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day . Yesterday this prompted Jenni Russell, the Times political commentator and family friend, to come to the Labour leader's defence – by revealing his actual kitchen is 'lovely'. She tweeted: 'Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks.' Mr Miliband is godfather to her child. When a Twitter user expressed surprise, she replied: 'It's not 2 kitchens! More like Times' tea prep area. Can't even sit in it.' Last night Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Clearly there's no cost of living crisis for 'Two Kitchens' Miliband. 'It's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his £2million mansion. Red Ed can try as much as he likes to portray himself as a man of the people but the only people he's in touch with are the North London metropolitan elite.' Last night a Labour Party spokesman declined to comment.","Mr Miliband has a second kitchen for 'tea and snacks' next to sitting room .

"A New Jersey man who thought he was building his dream home ended up with a worthless pile of bricks he says has cost him his happiness and all his money. Humayun Akhtar, 66, built the sprawling Florham Park home for him and his wife in 2007. Almost immediately, he says, cracks began to appear throughout the house, which he soon learned was collapsing into its unsound foundations and sliding off the side of the hill on which it was built. Now Akhtar is in a protracted court battle with builder JDN Properties, who he says have left him financially ruined and emotionally broken. This home in Florham Park, New Jersey was meant to be Humayun Akhtar's $1.6 million dream home for him and his wife but substandard construction turned it into a nightmare . 'I used to be a singing, laughing person,' Akhtar told WABC. 'I don't listen to music anymore. I haven't seen a movie in ten years, I can't relax anymore.' Akhtar and his family have not spent a single night in the home, which has buckled so severely that a marble placed on the floor will roll freely without the slightest push. 'I spent all the money I had and I was cleaned out. I have nothing now,' he said. Akhtar successfully won a settlement against JDN Properties in 2011 for $7.4 million on claims the company defrauded him by cutting corners on soil beneath the foundation that wasn't strong enough to bear the house. However, the company recently won an appeal of that decision. JDN Properties argues they tried to get Akhtar to let them repair the home before the damages worsened.

Now the case will be seen before a New Jersey jury, which will decide if JDN Properties knowingly defrauded Akhtar. Meanwhile, Akhtar's attorney David Stanziale told ABC News that the home has gone into foreclosure. 'This whole thing has destroyed my life,' Akhtar said. 'I feel like a fool. Now I have to live 250 years to recover all the money I lost.'

"A new study of the Islamic State's finances has revealed previous that estimates suggesting the terror group earns $2billion every year could be far too low. ISIS' finance chief Sheikh Abu Saad al-Ansari - who operates from ISIS' Iraqi stronghold Mosul - is understood to have recently approved the terror group's first annual budget  - revealing and estimated spend of $2 billion this year, plus a expected surplus of $250 million. The budget suggests ISIS' annual income could be as much a quarter of a billion dollars more than experts previously suggested - with the bulk of the terror group's revenue coming from oil sales, organ harvesting, ransom and extortion payments, and the looting and sale of ancient antiquities. If the revised figure is accurate, it means ISIS' annual income now exceeds that of Al Qaeda - making the terror group lead by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the wealthiest jihadi organisation in history. Criminal: Despite ISIS' claims to be a devout religious organisation, the majority of their income is believed to come from illegal means - such as mafia-style extortion threats - and even drug and people smuggling . The United States Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, David S Cohen, appeared to confirm that ISIS earns far more than previously estimated, according to Middle East Eye, by confirming that the terror group's budget was more than $2 billion. Despite ISIS' claims to be a devout religious organisation, the majority of their income is believed to come from illegal means - such as the black-market sale of oil, mafia-style extortion threats - and even drug and people smuggling. According to the Russian Federal Drug Control Service, ISIS has turned the ancient city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, is a centre for its heroin trade, MME reports.. Experts believe that roughly $1billion of ISIS' income comes from the sale of heroin and that half the heroin on sale in Europe has passed through the terrorists' hands and helped to fill its coffers. Power: If the revised figure is accurate, it means ISIS' annual income now exceeds that of Al Qaeda - making the terror group lead by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) the wealthiest jihadi organisation in history . MailOnline revealed last December that human organ traffiking is another way ISIS finances its activities . Last month the UN's ambassador to Iraq, Mohamed Alhakim, claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near Mosul. Looted treasure: This gold-plated bronze figurine was stolen from a museum in Hama, western Syria . Speaking of ISIS' organ harvesting operations, Mr Alhakim said: 'We have bodies. Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts.' He also said a dozen doctors have been 'executed' in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting. The shocking news of ISIS trade in human organs was first revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website in December, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli. He told the site that ISIS commanders hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in Mosul that is already beginning to generate huge profits.

He told the site that ISIS commanders hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in Mosul that is already beginning to generate huge profits. Last month it was revealed that militants fighting for ISIS in Syria are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy Westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men. Looted from ancient buildings in ISIS strongholds, such as the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, the antiquities are up to 10,000-years-old and can exchange hands for more than $1 million each. Lucrative: ISIS has set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market . Security: A Syrian police officer patrols the ancient of Palmyra to protect its ruins from looters and smugglers . The most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy Europeans - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects, which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring Lebanon and Turkey. The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year. The finer points of ISIS trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the BBC. It revealed that ISIS militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control. If the smugglers decide not to buy the items, they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry, regardless of their historic significance. ISIS is believed to generate a total of several million pounds a day, with approximately £400,000 of that coming from the sale of oil. Wealthiest jihadis in history: ISIS' budget suggests the terror group's annual income could be as much a quarter of a billion dollars more than experts previously suggested . A further £250,00 comes from extortion and protection money paid by companies and individuals operating in areas under its control, while ISIS also makes money from farming, water services and electricity production. Revenue obtained from ransoms paid by the families or governments of kidnapped individuals in less easy to calculate, but the price for release is usually millions of pounds. Companies and lorry drivers are forced to pay road and import taxes to use roads in areas under ISIS' control - with lorries charged £500 per journey, plus a further £250 tax for electronic good and £200 for food parcels. However one expected source of income is the looting of antiques from the many ancient religious sites in areas under its command. For example, one Iraqi intelligence official claimed that ISIS earned £23 million in early 2014 alone by selling 800 items stolen from the ancient city of Al-Nabk near Damascus.","ISIS believed to make $250 million more each year than previously thought .

"She shocked fans with an eyebrow-raising photoshoot, earlier this week. But actress Chloe Sevigny swapped strategically-placed lobsters for a more low-key approach to fashion when she stepped out in New York on Friday. The blonde star was seen looking decidedly modest as she emerged for the first time since ther provocative shoot for Marfa Journal went viral. WARNING: EXPLICIT CONTENT . Covered-up: Chloe Sevigny swapped strategically-placed lobsters for a more low-key approach to fashion when she stepped out in New York on Friday . Wearing a faux fur jacket with a pair of slim-cut, stonewash jeans, she cut something of a retro figure as she navigated the East Village. Capping her look with a black, leather bag and a matching pair of boots, she'd obviously been treating herself to a spot of retail therapy as she carried a shopping bag. Hiding behind a pair of designer sunglasses and sipping a take-away coffee, she looked almost incognito after causing such a stir. That 70s-inspred showgirl: Wearing a faux fur jacket with a pair of slim-cut, stonewash jeans, she cut something of a retro figure as she navigated the East Village . Just 24 hours earlier Chloe, whose hit film include The Last Days Of Disco with Kate Beckinsale, caused quite a scene on the cover of the Marfa Journal. Not least because the 40 year-old could be seen nearly naked and sprawled out over a retro kitchen work top - with a large marine crustacean between her legs. The image was just one of many bizarre visuals, from a nun in chain underwear to scantily-clad Red Riding Hood. Claws for draws: Choe Sevigny ditches her underwear for new Marfa Journal pictures as she poses with a lobster over her crotch . The four fake billboards divide the whole magazine into four sections: raw, decadent, romantic and progressive. And they're sure to continue to get attention, though loyal fans' interest in the content may be waning as the shoot sees the Swedish actress in a whole new light. Golden Globe winning and Academy Award nominated Chloe has previously enjoyed roles in Boys Don't Cry and American Psycho but these latest roles appear to put her in an all new-genre. In the most shocking image of the four book quarters, the beauty ditches her underwear in favour of the large marine crustacean.

It was Chloe Sevigny's riskiest photo shoot so far, and it was all for a European publication known for their love of flesh baring spreads. The Big Love star posed away in a myriad of looks from Jean Paul Gaultier, Betsey Johnson, and Chanel. But it was the shot where she was wearing nothing but a Proenza Schouler coat and shoes with a lobster strategically covering her nether region, that took the cake. The double-breasted wool number came in a navy check and black color block pattern and the statement style represented the DNA of the hip NY based label quite well.

The fashionista was not without her accessories nonetheless and layered on some tribal beads between her bare chest and accentuated her enviable waist with a studded belt. She was seen sporting a subtle plaid coat, tying her tresses into a fuss-free low bun as she posed in a derelict kitchen setting. While it is not believed that the lobster is real, PETA's Managing Director Ingrid E. Newkirk told MailOnline: 'We're too kind to say what a pity it is that the lobster wasn't alive and wearing knuckledusters. 'So all we'll say is that we hope one day Chloë will realise how inferior she seems compared to a little animal who was killed just to cover a t**t. Fashionista: The fashion darling was still styled to perfection in Jean Paul Gaultier and Chanel Cruise . Daring: The actress appeared to poke fun at the movie industry with a series of mock film posters . Chloe, going virginal in white for a second picture, shows off her youthful frame in a second poster while dressed in a nun costume and headscarf. The title reads, 'Two Times A Virgin' and she sports lace knickers with a padlock and chain between her thighs to pose provocatively on her knees. Stylist Haley Wollens uses Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star, as the cover caption indicates, with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier. Chloe, photographed by Brianna Capozzi, enjoys a throwback moment in velvet for one snap and adds a sexy edge to a red cape for another Running With Wolves mock up. Baring her rock hard stomach, the actress sums it up perfectly as she scrawls 'I put the HOT in PSYCHOTIC' across her abs while puffing on a cigarette.

Chloe clashes her moods as she sports a sweet, white bonnet but pulls down her tights to reveal her derriere while leaning over a dirt bike. Bi-annual European publication, Marfa Journal, combines of art and fashion and is now in its third issue, edited by Alexandra Gordienko. Movies appear to be the hot topic for Chloe at the moment, after she publicly named and shamed her favourite (and detested) female movie stars this week. The blonde hit out at Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence in the spring issue of V magazine. She said: ‘I love when a movie star is a great movie star. I think Angelina is a great movie star. ‘I like Emma Stone. Whenever she’s herself, she’s really cute. Jennifer Lawrence I find annoying.

"Teenage rebellion is a subject that strikes fear into the hearts of any parent. How to handle your growing child when they simply won't behave - at home or at school - and what to do when they won't communicate or worse, descend into a barrage of blistering abuse when they do speak. One of the country's leading headteachers says parents fearing their offspring are heading off the rails can remedy many situations, however volatile, if they simply work more closely with the child's school. Dame Sally Coates, pictured at her home in Twickenham, London, said parents need to strike a balance between being too strict and too soft with their children . Dame Sally has been widely praised for her no-nonsense approach to discipline and for turning around Burlington Danes Academy in White City, London (pictured) Dame Sally Coates,  who turned around Burlington Danes Academy in White City, London, and has been widely praised for her no-nonsense approach to discipline, says parents are often too quick to get into a battle with the school when a child misbehaves. 'Parents and schools must support each other. If a child is rude at home and gets into trouble at school, frequently they'll go home and complain that a teacher is picking on them,' she tells FEMAIL. 'So the parent, to win over a bad relationship at home, will take the position of the child and attack the school. 'I’ve seen this happen so many times and it’s the worst thing to do.' Dame Sally has spent 40 years working in challenging schools and is currently director of the education charity United Learning's southern academies. During her time as head of some of London's toughest schools, Dame Sally says she was always adamant on seeing parents alone if there was a problem: 'Parents should work with the school. If you're worried about your child, meet with the school without them there. 'If you work together then you’re much more likely to be successful than if you use the school as a way of getting back into the good books with your child.' With four children of her own and three step-children with husband Serge, Dame Sally has, during some of the most demanding periods of her career, juggled teenagers at home and teenagers at work and appreciates young people don't come with a manual. 'There are thousands of programmes on television about how to cook, but there are hardly any about how to be a good parent. It's important to strike a balance between being too strict and too soft. Dame Sally, pictured with her husband Serge Cefia, has four children of her own and three step-children . Schools must share responsibility when things go wrong too, she adds: 'Teachers and heads work with thousands of teenagers, whereas parents just deal with one or two. 'People go into parenthood with no advice or training. Getting it right is not easy. 'In the past, I’ve put students on report at home to ensure that their behaviour with their family is as good as their behaviour at school. 'We’ve also looked after confiscated games consoles on behalf of parents until after the exam period is over.' Teenage rebellion comes in many forms with modern parents fearing the dangers associated with issues such as social media and religious fundamentalism alongside the classic teen angst issues of drugs, alcohol and underage sex. So how can you tell if your teenager is just being a normal adolescent or slipping into something more worrying? Dame Sally Coates with her husband Serge Cefia (far right) and two of her sons, Nathan (second right) and Theo (third right) at their home in Twickenham, London . 'Red flag signs might be that a child becomes withdrawn or secretive but the only real guide is to use your common sense.' Dame Sally, who has just published a new book, Headstrong, on school leadership says the importance of good parenting in early childhood shouldn't be underestimated. 1). Don't try and resolve issues during a heated argument: It's better to wait until you're both feeling calm. Sit down and talk. Have conversations about your relationship and areas of conflict. 2). Don’t take the bait: When they answer back, it’s OK to ignore it sometimes. Never cite their friends or other siblings as being better than them. 3). Give more praise than criticism . 4). Avoid false threats: Don’t threaten things that you’re not going to carry out. 5). Try and have fun:  Make time to do nice things, something that you both like doing . 'Make sure that young children have boundaries. Giving in is the easiest option but should be resisted. Understand that teenagers are going to be quite difficult. Work through problems with them rather than taking them on head-on.' Pupils were asked to call their female teachers not as 'Miss' but 'Madam' - the proper equivalent of 'Sir' and those students turning up even a few seconds later than the morning bell would be issued with a same-day detention. 'The primary responsibility of a school is academic success, but there are plenty of other things that matter too. 'A lot of the softer things that we teach in schools like manners and presentation skills are really important. 'At Burlington Danes, we expected students to stand up on the bus for an older person, and to walk along pavements without taking up the whole space. Schools can and should train students for this.' And there is responsibility too, she says, when it comes to preparing young people for the world of work. 'Students should know how to shake hands, how to dress for interviews, how to be confident without being overbearing and how to write a CV.' Has the superhead's own family life suffered from such a stellar career? 'I’m very good at prioritising my time, very organised, but sometimes things do have to give. Dame Sally, who has just published a new book, Headstrong, on school leadership says the importance of good parenting in early childhood shouldn't be underestimated . 'My children might say that sometimes I wasn’t at the school gates enough to pick them up. You just hope that you instill the right values to turn out nice people who can fulfill their potential - whatever that may be - and have self esteem and confidence.' And the key to work/life balance in her experience? 'Delegation is critical: surrounding yourself with great people at work. I’ve been fortunate with energy and good health.'

"Italy has reopened one of the most famous ruins of Pompeii, following threats the site might lose its UNESCO World Heritage site listing and millions in EU funding unless it is restored. The Villa dei Misteri (Villa of Mysteries), an estate on the outskirts of Pompeii's city centre that features some of the best-preserved frescoes of the site, is now open to the public after one of many restoration projects ordered by the EU. The historic Roman city, which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 AD, has been accused of mismanagement and neglect, and the EU has given the Italian government until the end of 2015 to fix its problems. Scroll down for video . Like new: The Villa dei Misteri(The Villa of Mysteries) in Pompeii has been restored and reopened . Work: Years of neglect has meant that Italy faced losing Pompeii's World Heritage status, along with funding, and the government was issued with a deadline by EU to spend £78 million by 2016 for restoration projects . Preserved paintings: The Villa dei Misteri features some of the best-preserved frescoes in the remains of Pompeii and is classed as a Unesco World Heritage Site . Revamp: One of the frescoes that has been restored to its former glory at the Villa of the Mysteries at the ancient archaeological site of Pompeii . Culture Minister Dario Franceschini, who cut the ribbon to open the villa on Friday, said that while problems still remain at Pompeii, Italy is on schedule to meet their EU deadline. Italy has been ordered to spend 105 million euros (£78million) in EU funds by the end of the year for maintenance and restoration projects, or lose its funding. While only three projects have been completed, 13 are underway and some 65 million euros has been awarded in contracts, officials said. In addition, 85 people have been hired to work on the site and visitor numbers last year were 200,000 more than in 2013. More than 80 people have worked on the Pompeii site to restore the artwork in a bid to boost visitor numbers . Italy had been ordered to restore the works of art by the EU in a programme, which cost the country 105million euros . The historic Roman city, which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 AD, has been accused of mismanagement and neglect . 'We know well that the world looks with great attention at everything that happens at Pompeii,' Franceschini said as he stood before a fresco of Dionysius and Aphrodite in the villa's main salon. 'Today, Italy is proud to say to the world that we have turned a page.' Pompeii, a busy commercial city overlooking the Mediterranean, was destroyed in A.D. 79 by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius that killed thousands of people and buried the city in 20 feet of volcanic ash. UNESCO threatened to take the ancient city of Pompeii off its World Heritage site list unless the artwork was restored .

The mold of a victim of the volcanic eruption, which destroyed the ancient city of Pompeii in A.D. 79 . But the ash also helped preserve Pompeii's treasures, providing precious information about life in the ancient world. The first excavations began in the 18th century, but even today only two-thirds of the site's 60 hectares (150 acres) have been uncovered. In recent years, Pompeii has been bedeviled by neglect and mismanagement characteristic of Italy's underdeveloped south, as well as brushes with the corruption that has infected some other important public works in Italy, including its Expo 2015 World's Fair in Milan and the Moses water barrier project in Venice.

Hit by heavy rains, some of Pompeii's walls have literally crumbled. The 2010 collapse of the Villa of Gladiators, and further collapses at Pompeii the following year, caused such international alarm that the EU stepped forward with funding and Italy created a mini-administration to govern the restoration project and make sure it wasn't infiltrated by the mafia. Among other things, the EU project called for the site to be shored up and for a drainage system to be built. Meeting targets: Culture Minister Franceschini said that while problems still remain at Pompeii, Italy is on schedule to meet their EU deadline.

But Italy's chronic bureaucratic delays prevented progress and the EU made clear it that Italy would lose the money if it didn't use it by Dec. 31. At the same time, UNESCO threatened to take Pompeii off its World Heritage list — a coveted designation that inspires many of the site's more than 2 million visitors each year. A UNESCO inspection in November, however, acknowledged that progress had been made. Franceschini quoted from the UNESCO report, which said any question about Pompeii's place on the list had been 'overcome' and that there had been a 'profound change in the behaviour' of its administration.","The Villa dei Misteri(Villa of Mysteries) in Pompeii reopened .

"Twitter user Laura Evans posted a picture of this Karen Millen mannequin to Twitter and pointed out that it looked dangerously thin . Fashion store Karen Millen has come under fire for featuring a mannequin in their shop that appeared to be seriously underweight. Laura Evans, from Hampshire, tweeted a picture of one of the plastic models which featured ribs clearly protruding from the chest. She wrote: 'Karen Millen, why've you chosen to make collar bones & ribs so central to the marketing of this dress? Dangerous!' The medic's picture was quickly picked up by outraged women on the social media site, who called for the mannequin to be removed from the stores. One user called @WitchBrain wrote: 'Ewwww! I buy Karen Millen quite often, but I DO NOT want to look like this! What on earth is this about?' Another called ‏@JoLiptrott said: Shame on @KarenMillen for this normalising of the super-skinny. What a terrible message to send to our young women.' Women weren't the only ones disgusted by the mannequin's skinny frame though - men also voiced their distaste. A user called ‏@seanmurphy2711 wrote: 'Almost beyond belief. Someone has made conscious decision to do that.' A spokesperson for the British eating disorder charity BEAT said: 'It’s very concerning that well respected and influential high street fashion retailers persist in using obviously underweight mannequins. 'Unhelpful in fuelling the continuous exposure of thinness as the ‘ideal’, retailers should consider very seriously the messages that they put across and we should all play a part in giving a generation of young people confidence in their bodies, their appearance and their sense of wellbeing.' The spokesperson continued: 'People who are at risk, or already affected by an eating disorder can be triggered or maintained in the disorder by the images they see everywhere. 'The constant portrayal of a very slender look as the only aspirational ideal for young people needs to be challenged if a generation are to grow up with a robust sense of their self worth.' Laura Evans posted the picture of the mannequin on Twitter along with a photo of the dress on the runway . Twitter users were quick to voice their disgust at the pictures . Karen Millen has responded to the criticism on the social media site, with a spokesperson saying: 'As a brand we celebrate a range of body sizes within collections and offer size 6 through to 16. 'Both the mannequin and model you have seen representing Karen Millen are size 10 which is industry standard. 'No offence was meant and the intention is not to advertise a negative body image but to focus on the style of the garment in both instances. 'We are so sorry for any disappointment and upset this may have caused.' The model who wore the dress on the catwalk also had a very slender frame . The furore comes just a few weeks after the high street store Whistles were criticised for featuring a super skinny mannequin in one of their stores. With a protruding chest bone and super skinny arms, this is the incredibly slim mannequin being used by high street store Whistles. The shocking picture was taken by a passer-by of a window display of the brand's Angel store in London. It shows the thin-looking mannequin wearing a floaty white top. In response to the photograph below, which was taken in February, eating disorder charities have called for shops to take more responsibility for setting standards. Snapped: This is the shocking photo of a mannequin that was spotted in the Whistles store in Angel, London . Mary George from Beat, the UK's leading charity supporting those with eating disorders, said: 'It is disappointing to see such an obviously underweight mannequin in the high street. 'This stereotype can be extremely harmful to some and while the fashion industry doesn't directly cause eating disorders- it has a powerful influence that is highly toxic to some vulnerable young people. 'We call on retailers to recognise the responsibility they have to use this influence in positive, life enhancing ways. Fashion can be fantastic- creative, aspirational and fun. 'What we need is a mixture of different heights and widths of mannequins in our shops to reflect the reality of people's different shapes and sizes, heights, widths and build.' Amina Hays, who took the photograph of the mannequin after spotting it in Upper Street brand of Whistles, said she found it 'revolting'. The 32-year-old said: 'There has been so much uproar with the fashion industry not representing 'real' women I thought idiocies like this had been abolished. 'I'm a size eight and this made me feel fat which is just not acceptable.' Controversy: Whistles has come under fire from eating disorder charities for using super slim mannequins . Marg Oaten MBE, the secretary and co-founder of SEED Eating Disorder Support Services, told FEMAIL: 'Without doubt the mannequin is not a realistic reflection of a body size and shape. 'It is outrageous to portray this as acceptable – people may aspire to this body shape whilst people with an eating disorder, may in fact consider themselves not thin enough. 'I really do think the retailers have a duty of care to its shoppers to be more realistic in the size of the model or mannequins that they use to showcase their goods.' Marg went on to say: 'Often people who are low in self-esteem have a false belief that by managing body weight and shape they will be happier, in truth they may plummet to dangerously low levels in weight that may cause them to be medically at risk. 'People need to be comfortable in the skin they are in – and celebrate the difference in body weight and shape. She added: 'Promoting clothing in this way can be highly dangerous to potential sufferers of anorexia nervosa. 'An eating disorder has the highest mortality rate of any other mental health illness with a staggering 20 per cent of people dying each year from their illness or through suicide. 'Manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility for their actions and consider the consequences of how this may impact on people suffering from an eating disorders.' Gina Hutchings, a part time plus model said: 'I do not think the fuller figure has made its way to high fashion yet which is sad as fuller figured women can be just as stylish as slimmer women. 'The high street usually means clothes everyone can wear so it’s disappointing to see this mannequin used by Whistles. 'Skinny shaming is now as bad as fat shaming and as talked about but Whistles are failing to show a healthy figure.' MailOnline also contacted Whistles for comment. In October student Becky Hopper posted this image of her friend standing next to a Topshop mannequin with stick thin legs . More women with normal sized legs posed next to the Topshop mannequin. The store said it was not meant to represent a real woman . In October, Topshop was slammed for using using mannequins with stick thin legs with student Becky Hopper sharing a picture of her friend posing comparing her legs to those on the model. The image was shared more than 7,000 times .A Topshop spokesman said the mannequin was ‘based’ on a size 10. ‘The form is a stylised one to have more impact in store and create a visual focus,’ said the spokesman. ‘Mannequins are made from fibreglass, so [they] need to be of certain dimensions to allow clothing to be put on and removed. This is therefore not meant to be a representation of the average female body.’ Over the last decade, campaigners have been fighting back against a series of fashion and online trends they say encourage eating disorders. A row over so-called 'size zero' models was sparked in 2000 when the British Medical Association linked an obsession with 'abnormally thin' models on TV and in magazines with the rise in conditions such as anorexia and bulimia. Madrid Fashion Week banned models with a body mass index below 18.5 from its catwalks in 2006 in what was seen as a victory for campaigners against size zero. But later that year, Paraguayan model Luisel Ramos was found dead from a heart attack linked to malnutrition and six months later her sister, model Eliana Ramos, 18, died in similar circumstances. Their deaths were used to highlight the pressure on models to meet a demand for unnaturally thin young women. Campaigners have hit out over the use of 'size zero' models on catwalks and have linked the desire among women to emulate the so-called 'thigh gaps' of models like Cara Delevingne (right) to eating disorders . Last year, internet craze 'thinspiration' - where people post photographs of their emaciated bodies on social media to 'inspire' weight loss - was also blamed for encouraging eating disorders. Susan Ringwood, from charity Beat, said: 'Those pictures are very unlikely to be real. 'They are digitally manipulated to make the bodies shown appear extremely emaciated. Altered pictures of famous people are often included too.' A further craze by girls to emulate model's 'thigh gaps' erupted earlier this year when experts warned it was further fuelling the issue. Nancy Albus, head of a facility which deals with sufferers in St. Louis, USA said: 'The intrusion and presence of social media in our lives really does make it very difficult. 'The important distinction about thigh gap is it gives you an actual visual to achieve, this visual comparison of how your body does or doesn't stack up.'","Picture of an incredibly thin mannequin was posted on social media .

"The co-pilot blamed for deliberately crashing  a passenger jet with 150 people on board into the Alps used post-9/11 safety mechanisms to carry out his plan. Andreas Guenter Lubitz, 28, waited for his captain, Patrick Sondenheimer to leave the flight deck and go to the toilet before commanding the Airbus A-320 to descend. Once out of the cockpit, the door locked automatically. Ironically, this auto-lock feature, which led to Lubitz having sole control of the plane, was introduced as a way of improving flight safety in the wake of 9/11. Scroll down for video . The Airbus A-320 is fitted with a safety system, pictured, to prevent unauthorised access to the flight deck . Lubitz was sitting in this cockpit, pictured, when he commanded the jet to crash into the Alps at 400mph . Andreas Lubitz, pictured, locked his captain out of the cockpit and crashed the jet into the side of a mountain . The Airbus A320 is fitted with a locking mechanism to prevent unauthorised access to the flight deck while the aircraft is in flight. The door was also specially strengthened, to prevent someone from being able to barge their way through. The safety systems were improved in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks where hijackers were able to gain access to the cockpit and take over the aircraft. Access to the cockpit door on the Germanwings Airbus A320 (like the one above) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking . In normal flight, the door to the flight is closed and locked. Cabin crew can use a code and gain access to the flight deck. Entry is controlled by the flight crew, in case of a possible hijack attempt. The Cockpit Door Locking System (CDLS) according to the flight manual 'provides a means of electrically locking and unlocking the cockpit door'. The CDLS is located in the central pedestal between both pilots and has a toggle switch which controls the door. They also have a CCTV camera so they can see who is seeking access, and if they are under any form of duress. Pilots can restrict access to the flight deck although cabin crew can gain entry in an emergency. However, this emergency access can be over-ridden by the pilot for between five to 20 minutes. The limited time to keep the door closed is itself a safety feature, in case the flight crew become incapacitated. After the predetermined time, the keypad on the outside of the cockpit door will become operational again, unless the pilot actively restricts access again. Also the cockpit door has several other safety features in case of a sudden decompression which will cause the door to open. According to the flight manual there are 'routine' and 'emergency' access requests. The door locking mechanism is on the centre console, pictured,  so it can be operated by either pilot . The pilot has to flick one simple switch, pictured,  to lock the cabin door for between five and 20 minutes . 'The toggle switch enables the flight crew to lock or unlock the cockpit door, following an access request, thereby allowing or denying the entry to the cockpit.' The flight manual states that the control unit is responsible for: . On the Airbus A320, there are three settings: . School friends said that Lubitz paused his pilot's training in 2008 after suffering from 'burnout' and depression. On November 29, 2013 Mozambique Airways Flight LAM 470 crashed on a scheduled passenger flight between Maputo, Mozambique and Luanda, Angola. Air crash investigators think the Embraer 190 jet was flown into the ground by the captain after his copilot went to the toilet, killing everyone. The jet's captain, Herminio dos Santos Fernandes was believed to have had serious personal problems at the time of his death. Mozambique Airways Flight LAM 470 crashed into the ground, pictured,  after the pilot locked his colleague, who went on a toilet break, out of the flight deck before commanding it to crash from 38,000 feet . When his co-pilot went to the toilet, flight data information recovered from the scene found that Fernandes manually changed the aircraft's altitude from 38,000 feet to almost 600 feet below ground level. He also pushed the aircraft's throttles back to idle and selected the jet's maximum operating speed. Chillingly, the cockpit voice recorder picked up the sound of the co-pilot pounding on the door, similar to Captain Patrick Sondenheimer's attempts to regain access to the flight deck.","Since 9/11 all passenger jets are required to lock the cockpit door in flight .

"An Alabama woman on trial for murder in her granddaughter's death called out the child's name time after time as the girl lay on the ground after collapsing, but didn't tell medics the girl had run for hours, according to evidence presented on Tuesday. Joyce Hardin Garrard, 49, is heard repeatedly calling the name of 9-year-old Savannah Hardin in the more than 11-minute 911 recording played in an otherwise silent courtroom. The child's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, told the 911 operator the girl had a seizure. Garrard talked in the background. Jurors heard a 911 during which Joyce Hardin Garrard didn't tell medics that she had made the girl had run for hours and could also be heard asking for 'a smoke' while the child was unconscious . 'Savannah, open your eyes,' Garrard is heard saying. 'Savannah. Savannah,' Garrad says. 'How is she doing?' operator Lori Beth Beggs asks. 'We can't get her to come to,' Hardin responds. Garrard's lawyers haven't denied that the girl ran before her collapse, but the defense said the woman had no intention of harming her granddaughter. The recording showed Hardin, who is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl's death, never told Beggs the child had been running or that she had any previous medical problems. Beggs said the information could have been useful to her treatment. Savannah died in a hospital three days later. A firefighter who came to the scene said Garrard also never told emergency workers the child had been running. She 'was telling us she had a seizure and she was trying to get her to respond,' said Justin Hairrell of the Mountainboro Volunteer Fire Department. The 911 operator said Garrard is heard early in the recording asking for 'a smoke' while the child was unconscious. The defense suggested the woman was actually asking for something to cover the child with, like a small a blanket. 'Did she in fact say, ""Give me a throw?''' asked defense lawyer Richard Rhea. 'No. ""Give me a smoke,''' said Beggs. Victim: Garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter, Savannah Hardin (pictured left and right), nine, to run to her death at her home in Etowah County in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates . Also in court on Tuesday, neighbor Jolie Jacobs testified that Savannah was crying and begging to stop before she collapsed. Garrard, 49, 'was hollering at her, telling her she better move it,' Jacobs told jurors. Prosecutors say Garrard ran 9-year-old Savannah Hardin to death as punishment for a lie three years ago. Jacobs lived across the street from the girl's home at the time. She said she saw Savannah running and carrying wood as Garrard yelled at her. 'She was crying and begging to stop,' Jacobs said, Savannah fell in apparent exhaustion, still crying. 'Joyce kept telling her to move it.' Jacobs said that she stood on her porch on several occasions after 6:30 p.m. on February 17, 2012, after she saw Savannah collapse and begin throwing up. Garrard, she said, tried pouring water in Savannah's mouth and told her, 'You better drink up or you can't go to the bathroom.' 'She was throwing up while she was trying to get water,' Jacobs testified. Jacobs then said that as light began to fade around sunset, she thought she heard what sounded like Garrard striking the child. She tried to recreate the sound, which she described as 'skin on skin.' Biting her lip, Jacobs said she decided she had to intervene after about four or five trips to her front porch, and went inside to tell her husband. By the time they both came back out, medics had arrived. The girl died in a hospital three days later, and Jacobs said she regrets not doing something to help. 'It had gone on long enough,' she said as she blinked away tears. 'I wish I had done something a lot sooner.' Defense attorney Dani Bone questioned how Jacobs could have seen these events after showing her a paper stating sunset was at 5:30 p.m. that day. 'I know what I saw and heard,' she replied. The defense denies that Garrard meant to do anything to harm the child. On Monday prosecutors had compared Garrard, 49, to a drill sergeant. She could face the death penalty or life without parole if convicted. Assistant district attorney Marcus Reid said during opening statements in a standing-room-only courtroom that jurors would hear from neighbors who say they heard and saw what happened to Savannah the day she died. Mother and daughter: Savannah (pictured with her mother in a Facebook photo) eventually collapsed and started fitting. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium . Defense attorney Dani Bone tried to raise doubt about medical evidence in the case by showing jurors a version of the indictment, which mentioned severe dehydration and seizures. However, Bone said Savannah died because of a fatally low sodium level. He said the evidence will show the girl had too much water in her system, not that she was dehydrated. Bone told jurors that prosecutors 'have oversold their case to the world.' 'They're trying to hoodwink you with junk science,' he said. 'Make them prove their case.' According to prosecutors, neighbors said Garrard yelled at the girl as she ran, forcing her to continue 'like some kind of drill sergeant.' At one point, a neighbor saw the girl vomiting on her hands and knees, begging to stop, Reid said. When paramedics arrived, they found Savannah on the ground, 'freezing cold to the touch,' her clothes and shoes soaking wet, Reid said. Garrard never told the medics that the girl had been running; she said only that the girl collapsed in the yard. The 9-year-old was rushed to a Birmingham hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium, a condition common in marathon runners. Savannah wasn't supposed to eat chocolates because she was on medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had a bladder problem, but she had eaten candy on the school bus the day before she died. Arrests: Garrard (pictured, left, in her police mugshot) was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin (right). The former's trial began on Monday . Garrard was angry that Savannah ate the candy – 'but she was more upset about the lie,' Reid said. Surveillance video from a school bus shown to a jury showed Garrard talking with the bus driver, Raenna Holmes, about Savannah taking candy without paying from another student who was selling it. Garrard told Holmes: 'She's going to run until I tell her to stop. She's gonna learn.' The women then talk about a bladder condition the girl had and a procedure she had related to that condition. The driver then asks, 'Is she OK?' Garrard replies: 'She might be when I get about four more bottles of water in her.' Garrard said Savannah was 'in double trouble' because she took the candy without paying and because she lied about it. Holmes said in court that she saw the girl picking up sticks in the yard but did not see her running. 'I feel partly responsible. I should have paid for those candy bars,' Holmes said. Opening statements followed a jury selection process that lasted nearly three weeks. The judge in the case has refused the defense's request to move the trial to a venue where it less well known. Scene: Gerrard allegedly made her granddaughter carry sticks of wood as she ran to her death at her home (pictured). But defense lawyers are expected to argue that the third-grader's death wasn't Gerrard's fault . This morning, Garrard was seen entering a county courtroom dressed in a pale green jacket and a striped blouse, with a heart-shaped pendant around her neck. Around 15 family members watched as the defendant was led in handcuffs to her seat at the Etowah County Courthouse. The trial is expected to last a week. Security is tight for the start of Garrad's trial. Etowah County deputies were pictured using a metal detector to screen anyone entering the courtroom today, while all cellphones have been banned. This afternoon, prosecutors will put forward their allegations against Garrard, who was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside . Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin, is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl's death. Authorities said she failed to intervene while the older woman forced the girl to run. Savannah lived with her father, who was out of town at the time of her death. Run to death: Savannah (pictured) suffered from unspecified medical issues that resulted in frequent doctors visits, court documents state.

"They are the haunting, hooded figures, who walk the streets of Spain's towns and villages during the last week of Lent.

Although the most-visited city during the Catholic celebration is Seville, in Andalucia, Zamora, in the north-west of the country, is also well known for its 16 religious brotherhoods and fraternities. In 1986, Holy Week in Zamora was declared a tourist interest of Spain and visitors continue to descend on the city in the lead-up to Easter, particularly to line the streets to view the scheduled processions.

"A retired Wisconsin sheriff's deputy accused of murdering his wife and her sister appeared in court and plead not guilty to the crime, blaming it on the side effects from ALS. Andrew Steele, 40, of Fitchburg, claims that the terminal disease - which he was diagnosed with in June - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), affected his brain making him unable to obey the law. Steele argued that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses, according to TwinCities.com . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, was wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara . Case: Steele argued that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . The former cop spoke in court, briefly, for the first time since he was charged with first-degree intentional homicide for the murders of his wife, Ashlee Steele, 39, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, 38, of Lake Elmo, at the Steele home in Fitchburg on August 22, 2014. Tollefsbol called 911 and told a dispatcher that her brother-in-law had shot her before she died. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room. The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. However, the motive for the slayings remains a mystery. The sisters have left six children behind. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 percent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law. Steele will be back in court for what is expected to be an all-day motion hearing on March 27.","Andrew Steele, 40, claims that the terminal disease affected his brain .

"A tourist visiting Norway to witness tomorrow's total eclipse of the sun was mauled by a polar bear as he slept. Jakub Moravec, 37, had travelled from his home in the Czech Republic to enjoy the natural phenomenon in the scenic surroundings. But he was lucky to escape with relatively minor injuries to his  arm, chest and face after the bear broke into his tent and attacked him. Injured: Jakub Moravec, 37, was hospitalised after the bear attacked him as he slept . Scars: Mr Moravec suffered a number of cuts to his arms, chest, shoulders and face following the attack . The remains of a polar bear, which attacked Mr Moravec on Spitsbergen island after travelling to watch tomorrow's solar eclipse . Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Moravec said: 'We were sleeping in the tent, and when I woke up the polar bear was standing on top of me. 'It went straight to my head. Luckily my colleague shot it.' Moravec said he felt 'happy and fine' and that he only felt scared afterwards. During the attack, he said his thoughts were only 'to save my head'. Zuzanna Hakova, who was part of the same Czech tour party, said that her mother had shot the bear three times using a revolver. She said: 'We woke to shouts of 'Bear! Bear!' coming from the second tent. 'We had a rifle on the outside of each tent and we also had a revolver in our tent. 'The ones being attacked had no chance of getting their weapon, so my mother took her revolver and shot at the bear three times.' Moravec was one of a group of six campers who had travelled to the Svalbard islands in Norway's Arctic to enjoy the eclipse. Attack: The polar bear attacked the tents were the six campers were sleeping, before being shot dead by authorities . Camp: The remote Svalbard islands are one of only two places on land where the eclipse will be fully visible . He is now being treated in Longyearbyen, the islands' capital, for injuries to his face and arm. Police spokesman Vidar Arnesen said the group were on a combined ski and snow scooter trip on the remote islands more than 500 miles north of the Norwegian mainland. Norwegian media had reported that there are many seals in the area, a food source that attracts the bears. The Svalbard islands are one of only two places on land where the eclipse will be fully visible, along with the Faroe Islands.

Local authorities have repeatedly warned eclipse chasers of the region's dangerous polar bears. People leaving Svalbard's inhabited areas are required to be accompanied by an armed local guide or carry a rifle. An estimated total of 3,000 polar bears live in the region, far outnumbering the 2,500 inhabitants. There have been five fatal polar bear attacks in Svalbard in the past four decades. The most recent attack occurred in 2011, when 17-year-old British student Horatio Chapple was killed whilst on a school trip.","Jakub Moravec travelled from Czech Republic to enjoy total eclipse .

"With her hair pulled back and wearing no make-up, the woman at the window looks no different from other young mothers soon after childbirth as she pulls back the curtains to let the sun shine in on her new baby. But there the comparison ends, for 19-year-old Heather Mack faces a lifetime behind bars - or even death by firing squad - if convicted of the premeditated murder of her socialite mother, Sheilah von Wiese-Mack. A little more than 24 hours before this exclusive glance through a Bali hospital window, Miss Mack had given birth in a caesarian operation to her 6lb 1oz daughter, Stella Schaefer, the last name being that of the baby's father and her co-accused 21-year-old Tommy Schaefer. Scroll down for video . With her hair pulled back and wearing no make-up, Heather Mack looks no different from other young mothers soon after childbirth as she pulls back the curtains to let the sun shine in on her new baby at a Bali hospital . Earlier this week Mack had given birth in a caesarian operation to her 6lb 1oz daughter, Stella Schaefer, the surname being after the father and her co-accused 21-year-old Tommy Schaefer . Out of sight as she drew back the curtains at the Sanglah Hospital was the tiny baby in her cot and a prison guard. Although Miss Mack is not considered a flight risk, as a woman facing a serious charge she has to remain under guard at all time, no matter what the circumstances. Joining her in the hospital room - and standing for a short time at the window - were the child's grandmother, Tommy Schaefer's mother, and other relatives and friends who had flown from their homes in Chicago. And it is from his mother and relatives that Schaefer will have to rely for a first hand description of his baby, for he has been refused the right to travel under guard from Kerobokan Prison to the hospital. Prison sources said he was 'pacing up and down with frustration' in his cell as he anxiously waits for the moment when he will first set eyes on his daughter. ‘He’s going crazy in there, wanting to see his daughter, but he’s been told he's a prisoner on a serious charge and there will be no hospital visits,’ a prison source said. Mack, 19, was taken to hospital from Kerobokan Prison after she started to have contractions earlier this week . Mack had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital, pictured, wanted up front . Unless the prison grants him a special privilege to see the baby, he is unlikely to see her until - and if - Miss Mack takes the child with her to their next scheduled court appearance on March 24. There is every likelihood of the couple’s next court appearance - their cases are being held separately - being adjourned while she regains the strength to face the judges in the Denpasar District Court. Earlier Miss Mack had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital wanted up front. But her US attorney, Anthony Scifo, has told the Chicago Tribune - the city where the accused couple come from - that he was able to send money to Indonesia earlier in the week after working out a deal with Miss Mack’s uncle, who controls $1.56 million in a trust fund set up for her by her murdered mother. Miss Mack does not have access to the money under her 30th birthday. Mack had the baby in the Wings Amerta building of the Sanglah Hospital. The couple have claimed that the unborn baby has been at the centre of problems between Mrs Wiese-Mack and Schaefer. They have told police that she objected to her daughter’s pregnancy by Schaefer and during a fierce argument he struck Heather’s mother with the metal handle of a fruit bowl. If Miss Mack keeps to her stated intentions, she plans to keep the baby with her in the cell for the maximum allowed period of two years - unless there are dramatic developments in the case against her and she is able to leave the notorious prison. The pair (pictured together), from Chicago, Illinois, are being tried separately by the Denpasar District Court . Sheila Von Wiese-Mack's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel . But if convicted of the charge of premeditated murder, she - and Schaefer - could be sentenced to death by firing squad. It is not known when she will be returned to the prison with her baby, but hospital staff suggested it could be within the next 48 hours. Mack had earlier told friends who have been supporting her during jail visits that she was expecting her baby in April. This means the child was born prematurely. Last week  Schaefer told the trial that he had been attacked by Wiese-Mack and called a racially offensive name. He said that his relationship with Heather was not endorsed by her mother and he went to Bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant. After meeting with Mack at the hotel, they discussed how to inform von Wiese-Mack that Mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where Mack and her mother were staying. Speaking through an interpreter, Schaefer said Mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl, which he hid under his shirt as a 'precaution'. Asked by a judge why it was hidden, Schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself. According to Schaefer, he arrived in the room and found Mack weeping. He did not know why, but also saw that Mack's mother was screaming. 'She (von Wiese-Mack) was angry at me when she knew that Heather was pregnant,' Schaefer said, while trying to hold back tears. Heavily pregnant Mack (right), 19, and Tommy Schaefer (second from left), 21, sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of von Wiese-Mack . Mack, who was sitting beside her lawyer, sobbed at the testimony. He said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man. He said the situation got heated when von Wiese-Mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby. Schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which von Wiese-Mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds. 'I was angry, I took the fruit bowl and hit her,' Schaefer said, in tears. He added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim. After acknowledging she wasn't breathing, he tried to give her artificial respiration, while Mack, who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes, came back and tried to revive her mother. He said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the United States. In her first questioning in court on Wednesday, Mack, who is eight months' pregnant, said Schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von Wiese-Mack made the threat in an argument. 'The blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting,' Mack said. 'I asked Tommy to stop and then I ran into the bathroom.' Von Wiese-Mack's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets. The suitcase was later found in a taxi at the posh St. Regis Hotel in August. Heather Mack, 19, told an Indonesian court on Wednesday that her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, killed Shelia von Wiese-Mack (together-left) in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby . In February a health scare saw Mack rushed to hospital after she collapsed with stomach pain and started bleeding. She was taken to Bali's Sanglah Hospital, the main medical centre in Denpasar, where tourists and other foreigners are usually treated. Hospital officials later said Miss Mack's baby was safe but she had been taken to hospital for an immediate check-up because she was in pain and had lost blood. In January Mack had said she vowed to bring the baby up in the cramped Bali prison she shares with six others. She has told fellow prisoners in the Wijaya Kusuma cell block of her intentions - but that has not gone down well with several of the other women. 'Make arrangements to get your baby out of here,' one prisoner is reported to have angrily told her. 'We're fed up with being woken by crying babies.' In an adjoining cell a prisoner in her late 30s is raising a baby which cries through the night, waking other inmates. 'This is what your baby is going to be doing - waking us up - and we don't want that,' Heather was told by one woman - according to visitors leaving the prison after delivering food to relatives in the women's section of the notorious prison. The protests, however, have failed to dampen the resolve of Mack.","Heather Mack, 19, was pictured at her hospital window little more than 24 hours after giving birth to her daughter Stella via caesarian .
Mack and Stella's father Tommy Schaefer, 21, are on trial for the premeditated murder of her socialite mother Sheilah von Wiese-Mack .
He was refused the right to travel under guard from Kerobokan Prison to the hospital and was said to be 'pacing up and down with frustration'

"An envelope sent to the White House earlier this week has tested positive for cyanide and further tests will be carried out to confirm the finding, the Secret Service has said. On Monday, an envelope containing an 'unknown milky substance, in a container wrapped in a plastic bag,' appeared at the White House Mail Screening Facility, The Intercept reported. Though initial biological testing yielded negative results, chemical testing returned 'presumptive positive' for cyanide on Tuesday, CNN reported. Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary told CNN that the sample was transported to another facility to confirm the results with a third round of tests. Tests underway: An envelope sent to the White House earlier this week has tested positive for cyanide, the Secret Service said Tuesday, and a third round of tests to confirm the finding will now be carried out . 'Milky Substance:' On Monday, an envelope containing an 'unknown milky substance, in a container wrapped in a plastic bag,' showed up at the White House Mail Screening Facility . The Secret Service will have no further comment because the investigation is ongoing. A law enforcement official said the mail handler suffered no injuries and there were no exposure concerns, Fox reports. An alert identified the return address on the envelope as that of a man with a previous history of incidents with the Secret Service dating back to 1995, The Intercept reports. The man allegedly once sent a package to the White House covered in feces and urine. Then in a 2012 incident, the man sent a package to the White House containing mini alcoholic beverages. Suspicious letters often are sent to some of the country's leading politicians, including the president. Some test positive for hazardous substances while others include threats of death or physical harm. History: An alert identified the return address on the envelope as that of a man with a previous history of incidents with the Secret Service dating back to 1995. He has previously sent letters covered in urine . In June 2013, a West Virginia man was indicted on charges of threatening to kill Obama and his family in a letter that included profanity and racial slurs. A federal judge later dismissed the charges after forensic handwriting analysis conducted by the Secret Service showed that Ryan Kirker, 20, of McMechen, West Virginia, didn't write the letter. Two months earlier, letters sent to Obama, Republican Senator Roger Wicker and Mississippi judge Sadie Holland tested positive for the poison ricin. The letters addressed to the president and to the senator were intercepted before delivery, but one letter reached Holland. She was unharmed. James Everett Dutschke of Tupelo, Mississippi, pleaded guilty in January 2014 to sending the letters and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.","An envelope sent to the White House earlier this week has tested positive for cyanide and further tests will be carried out to confirm the finding .

"A bride has revealed that she was secretly hiding seven pounds of sagging skin under her wedding dress - after shedding 10 stone ahead of her big day. Tina Winmill ballooned to a size 28 and 20 stone after meeting her partner, Mark, eating takeaways and large meals. Refusing to walk down the aisle until she'd shed half her body weight, the 43-year-old from the Midlands, joined a slimming class with her similarly obese fiancé. Tina Winmill was left with layers of sagging skin after she lost half her body weight ahead of her wedding day . But after reaching a size 8 on top, Mrs Winmill was left with an apron of drooping flesh on her tummy, which hung down over her underwear. She was forced to buy a wedding gown in a size 12 to hide it, but despite what's hidden under her clothes, Mrs Winmill says she couldn't be happier. 'I bought some slimming pants to wear under my wedding dress and hold in the skin I'd been left with, but they made me look worse,' she said. 'The skin squeezed out the top so I never wore them. Luckily, my dress covered my arms so I wasn't conscious about the loose rolls around my armpits on the day. Despite achieving her desired weight goal on her top half, the bride had to go up a size for her wedding dress to accommodate for the rolls of drooping flesh . Ta da! The happy couple on their wedding day after they both shed their desired weights . 'And I can honestly say that looking at those wedding photos is the first time I have ever felt really happy with how I've looked. We've got wedding pictures up all over our house.' The couple first started gaining weight after meeting each other on Facebook in 2009. At that time Mrs Winmill was 18st but she soon gained weight. 'We were so in love we hardly noticed we'd piled on the pounds,' Mrs Winmill said. 'Six months later, we moved in together, which only encouraged our bad eating habits. We'd order takeaways and cook big meals.' Soon the couple had a combined weight of 45 stone, with Mr Winmill, 39, tipping the scales at 25 stone. It seriously affected their health. Mr Winmill was diagnosed with sleep apnoea, a condition associated with being overweight, which causes interrupted breathing during sleep. Mrs Winmill, a former retail assistant said: 'It was a really scary time. Seeing Mark struggling made me realise how out of control things were getting. Tina was 18 stone when she met Mark on Facebook, but quickly started gaining weight, eventually tipping the scales at 28 stone . Mark Winmill was diagnosed with sleep apnoea, a condition associated with being overweight, which causes interrupted breathing during sleep - they both knew they had to change their lifestyles . 'We knew we needed to lose weight but it was hard to have the motivation. Mark could have been triple that size and I'd still have loved him, so I didn't do anything about it.' On Christmas Day 2010, Mr Winmill, an engineer, proposed. 'I said yes, then I told him there was no way I was getting married until I could do it as a slim bride,' Mrs Winmill explained. She set herself the goal of losing 10 stone and the pair both signed up to Weight Watchers. She said: 'From there we helped each other stay on track. The pair went on to shed life-changing amounts of weight through portion control, and revealed their slimmer physiques at their wedding . 'We stopped having seconds and spent more time preparing meals rather than gorging on takeaways.' The couple learned about portion control and calories, and soon the pounds were melting away. Fast forward 18 months and Mrs Winmill had reached her target of 10st 10lbs while Mr Winmill weighed 14st 7lbs. She said: 'As soon as I reached my goal weight Mark said, 'Right, we're getting married now, you have no excuse,' and I knew he was right. 'I started planning straight away. I went shopping with my daughter, Kristie, 18. The happy couple lost a combined 23 stone and exchanged vows on 1 November 2013 in front of 20 guests . 'I picked out a size-12 wedding dress and it slipped right over me. It felt incredible and I fell in love with it.' They exchanged vows at Walsall Register Office on 1 November 2013, in front of 20 guests. Mr Winmill fitted into 34in waist trousers on the big day. His wife said: 'I slipped on my dress and was pleasantly surprised. 'Sometimes it brings me down now and I'd like the perfect figure. 'I wonder how much more weight I could lose without the skin. It would be nice to go the whole way. 'We're both keeping the pounds off' - Mrs Winmill has insisted the pair will stick to their new weight of 9st 11lbs and Mr Winmill's of 13st 3lbs . 'I couldn't afford the thousands of pounds of surgery. I need to win the lottery to lose the skin. 'I think there's about half a stone around my stomach, tops of legs and arms. 'But I wouldn't change anything. I was always big and I was bulging out of size-32 leggings at one point. I never imagined I'd be a size 8/10. 'People ask me ""Where's the loose skin?"" but my clothes hide it.' Following their big day the couple continued to shed weight. Now Mrs Winmill weighs 9st 11lbs and Mr Winmill, 13st 3lbs, after losing a whopping 12 stone. The combined 23-stone weight loss has left the couple over the moon. Mrs Winmill said: 'It's like we're different people to when we met. Not only are we healthier but we are half the people we were – literally. 'I am so proud of Mark and me for managing to lose all that weight. 'I'm never going back there. We're both keeping the pounds off.'","Tina Winmill, 43, was left with an apron of drooping flesh on her stomach after dramatically shedding 10 stone .

"There are a million women who wouldn't mind swapping places with Sarah Greene. Unlike the rest of the nation's females, Aidan Turner's beautiful Irish girlfriend is lucky enough to enjoy the smouldering Poldark star for real. The 29-year-old actress may not yet be a household name but she's also a long way off being just Turner's squeeze with a blossoming acting career of her own. They are very much a couple whose stars are in the ascendant. Scroll down for video . A very aspiring couple: Poldark star Aidan Turner, 31, with his girlfriend, 29-year-old actress Sarah Greene . Behind every brooding man: The couple have been together for four years and have weathered working apart for their careers. They say Skype has helped... And he is clearly smitten with his girlfriend of four years. In an interview with the Sunday Times this weekend, the 31-year-old Irishman says that while many couples, particularly those in the limelight, might have seen their relationship foundering under the pressure of work commitments, they didn't have that problem. 'You meet someone, you fall in love, then you can only see them over Skype or phone calls or texts and emails. And you have this whole other side to your relationship and it's... it was fun. He continues: 'We knew we really wanted to be together. And knew if we could do that, we could tackle a lot more. It was never: God, this is hard, bloody hell, we need to review this. This sucks. We never questioned it; it was great. So we had that from the beginning...' Early on in the couple's relationship, Greene painted a similar picture, previously admitting to the Irish Times that they are both resigned to periods apart: 'Well, that's the job we do. We'll always travel with work. Skype is great, and we're getting on brilliantly. 'It's been actually quite easy because we're both working. If I wasn't working it would be a lot harder.' Irish eyes: Greene, who was born in Cork, starred opposite Daniel Radcliffe in The Cripple of Innishmaan and was nominated for both a Laurence Olivier award and a Tony Award for her performance . So, who exactly is Sarah Greene and how did she successfully woo the man that is currently capturing millions of hearts while playing Cornish legend Captain Ross Poldark in the hit BBC series? To date, the Cork-born actress is best known for playing opposite Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe in The Cripple of Inishmaan. Greene played the role of Helen McCormick in the play and trod the boards in the London production in 2013 before transferring to Broadway the following year. It was a role that garnered plenty of praise from critics; nominations for Laurance Olivier and Tony Awards followed. The actress is currently starring in Penny Dreadful, a Dublin-based Sky Atlantic horror show about the cheap-to-buy, sensationalist books of the same name which were published in the 19th century. Masterpiece! Turner has admitted to using baby oil to make his body look perfect on screen . Although the Poldark star has said he had to seriously hit the gym to perfectly hone his physique, the make-up department had another trick to ensure his body looked suitably granite-like for the hit BBC show. Turner says that some kind of 'baby oil' was used to make his muscles ripple perfectly for the camera. And Captain Poldark's striking eyes might suggest Turners' own peepers were enhanced with make-up but that's not the case. He told the Times that while he had to wear eyeliner for 'some scenes', he definitely doesn't lush up his lashes with mascara. A role in the Canadian-Irish television series Vikings also raised the Irish beauty's profile and it seems Hollywood now beckons too. Later this year, the striking brunette is set to start work on a comedy, playing opposite Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. Born in Cork, Greene trained in Dublin, graduating from the Gaiety School of Acting in 2006 after becoming obsessed with being an actress after going to watch a local panto. She said: 'My parents took myself and my sister to see the Christmas panto Red Riding Hood in the Cork Opera House and I was sold, all I wanted to do was get up on the stage!' The couple met after working together in the play Titus Andronicus but it was a slow burn before a relationship developed. He told Irish Weekend Magazine in 2013: 'I did a play with her about eight years ago Titus Andronicus, directed by Selina Cartmell. 'I played Demetrius, her character wasn't a named character but we met on that. 'It was all very platonic and we never hooked up or anything, but that's how we got to know each other. And then years later we just met again and it just sort of took off.' His brooding good looks aren't always so refined either. The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.' It hasn't always been plain sailing on the love front either. Speaking to the Daily Mirror about being hurt by a past girlfriend, the actor said: 'Yes, it's happened to me. I've been upset, my heart's been broken. 'I don't know anyone on the planet who hasn't had their heart broken. Love is love. 'It's the purest and rawest thing we have in life and everyone experiences it.' He may have found happiness with Greene, but talks of engagement are too hasty. Last week, she told Irish entertainment websites and Goss.ie and Evoke.ie while at an event in Dublin: 'I'm not engaged.'","Aidan Turner has been dating fellow actor Sarah Greene for four years .

"Police in Malawi have arrested a man for trying to strangle to death a 16-year-old albino boy, while Tanzanian authorities have arrested 200 witchdoctors in a crackdown on the shocking trade. The suspect had been on the run after he was caught trying to kill the 16-year-old at his home in February and will soon appear in court facing a charge of attempted murder. Across many parts of Africa, albinos are killed for their body parts, which are then sold to witchdoctors who use them for rituals and potions. Police in Malawi have arrested a man for trying to strangle to death a 16-year-old albino boy. Pictured are children being kept at a centre to prevent them becoming victims of the black market trade in body parts . Six albinos have been killed in the southern African country of Malawi since December. File image used . Six albinos have been killed in the impoverished southern African country since December, according to the Association of Persons with Albinism in Malawi. Boniface Massah, the organisation's director, said Malawian albinos are 'living in fear of being attacked or killed' because of the recent spate of murders. Belief in witchcraft runs deep in Malawi and albino body parts are often used in rituals. Even the bodies of dead albinos are sometimes exhumed and sold. Earlier this week, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein denounced attacks against albinos as 'stunningly vicious, with children in particular being targeted'. Countries in east and west Africa are worst affected, and Tanzania near Malawi has one of the highest attack rates, where body parts sell for around $600 and an entire corpse fetches $75,000. Meanwhile, Tanzanian police said they had arrested 225 unlicensed traditional healers and soothsayers during a special operation carried out in several parts of the east African country and due to be extended to all 30 regions. Two women carry their albino children on May 5, 2014, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania . Advera Bulimba, a police spokesperson, said: 'Some of those arrested were found in possession of items like lizard skin, warthog teeth, ostrich eggs, monkey tails, bird claws, mule tails and lion skin.' He added the police campaign would target the entire network of gangsters, traders and witchdoctors, adding that 97 of those detained had already appeared in court. The statement also appealed to religious leaders, traditional elders, politicians and journalists 'to continue the awareness campaign against superstitious beliefs that are holding back the development of our country.' The announcement comes after President Jakaya Kikwete said the ongoing attacks against people with albinism, whose body parts are used for witchcraft, were 'disgusting and a big embarrassment for the nation'. In the most recently reported attack, a six-year-old albino boy's hand was hacked off with a machete and his mother assaulted as she tried to protect him. Savage attack: A group of men hacked off six-year-old Baraka Cosmas' right hand on Saturday night . On Tuesday, police said seven suspects had been arrested in connection with that attack, which left the boy and his mother hospitalised. And last week a Tanzanian court sentenced four people to death for the murder of an albino woman whose legs and right hand were hacked off with an axe and machete. The killers who were convicted also included the husband of the murdered woman. President Kikwete met with albino activists last week, promising to do more to stop the wave of violence. 'The government has long tried to do everything possible to stop the killings, we are very serious with this,' he said. 'But we still need to enhance our efforts to bring to an end these killings, which are disgusting and a big embarrassment to the nation.' Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. It affects one Tanzanian in 1,400, often as a result of inbreeding, experts say.","The man was arrested for trying to strange to death 16-year-old albino boy .

"Horrific: MIT police officer Sean Collier, 27, was found gurgling and covered in blood April 18, 2013 after prosecutors say he was shot in the head and neck by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev or his brother in a failed attempt to steal his gun . A Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who found a colleague in his squad car covered in blood three nights after the Boston Marathon bombing frantically repeated two words into his radio 'officer down, officer down.' A recording of that radio call was played to jurors hearing the trial of accused bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, on Wednesday, as prosecutors turned to the charge that the defendant and his older brother murdered MIT police officer Sean Collier on April 18, 2013, in an unsuccessful attempt to steal his gun. Meanwhile, the MIT police chief revealed his last words to the 27-year-old officer in a wrenching fifth day of testimony in the long awaited Boston bomber trial. Chief John DiFava on Wednesday recalled chatting with Collier about an hour before his death. 'I told him to be safe, and I left,' DiFava said, adding it was the last time he saw Collier alive. The officer who found Collier, Sergeant Clarence Henniger, said he was responding to a 911 call about possible shots fired on MIT's Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus, just outside Boston. Collier had visible bullet wounds to his temple, neck and hand and was so covered in blood that Henniger struggled to pull him from his vehicle. 'I could hear gargling coming from his mouth,' Henniger testified at U.S. District Court in Boston, where the jury hearing Tsarnaev's trial will also decide whether to sentence him to death if he is convicted of killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade bombs at the April 15, 2013, race. Jurors also saw surveillance footage of two figures approaching Collier's police cruiser on the MIT campus, spending about a minute at the car, and leaving. The only visible suggestions of commotion in the video are the car's brake lights, flashing on and off. Collier's gun belt and holster were covered in blood, evidence of Tsarnaev's clumsy but unsuccessful effort to steal his handgun, prosecutors have said. Tsarnaev's attorneys opened the trial by admitting he committed the crimes of which he is accused, but are seeking to spare him the death penalty by demonstrating he was following the lead of his older brother. Scroll down for video... Evidence: This forensics photograph released by the U.S. Attorney's office and presented during the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev shows a bloodied service pistol sitting on seat of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier's cruiser . 'Be safe': MIT Police Chief John DiFava testified he told Collier to 'be safe' about an hour before he was shot dead April 18, 2013 . Culpable? Tsarnaev's attorney says Dzhohkar's brother Tamerlan was the mastermind of the bombing and the one who pulled the trigger to kill Collier. Prosecutors say both brothers were culpable in the officer's murder and that they killed the 27-year-old in order to steal his gun and arm Tsarnaev . In the act? Video taken from above the site of Collier's April 18 murder purports to show the Tsarnaev brothers (circled) rounding a corner toward Collier's cruiser, at left (grab via WCVB) Federal prosecutors contend Tsarnaev, who emigrated with his family from Chechnya a decade before the attack, was driven by an extremist view of Islam and a desire to take revenge on the United States for military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries. Prosecutor William Weinreb said in his opening statement last week that it was unclear if Tsarnaev or his brother fired the weapon that killed Collier but argued that both brothers were equally culpable in the officer's death. A graduate student at MIT, Nathan Harman, who was bicycling on campus the night of the murder, testified on Wednesday that he saw Tsarnaev leaning into the driver's side door of Collier's car, but did not see the older sibling. 'I only saw the one person,' said Harman, referring to Dzhokhar. 'He sort of snapped up, stood up and turned around, and he looked startled…And then I just didn't think anything of it and rode off.'

Prosecutors also presented shredded pieces of a black and white backpack that they contend 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, used to carry their homemade bombs. The FBI agent also told the court that investigators found shrapnel along with ball bearings, a zipper, shards of metal, small nails and duct tape in the aftermath of the explosion. A bombing survivor told the court earlier this week that the victims' injuries were difficult to heal and became infected because of the 'dirty' nature of the bombs packed with small pieces of metal. DeLair showed  a piece of wire collected amid the wreckage on Boylston Street on April 15, 2013. The wire, she testified in U.S. District Court in Boston, was part of one of the bomb's detonators. 'It's the part of the bomb that would make it go off,' DeLair said. She took pictures of the . dead and coordinated efforts to recover 'everything from human . remains to bomb components to parts of backpacks,' she said on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, jurors were presented with photographs of the . blood-stained message that prosecutors say Tsarnaev wrote inside . the hull of a boat in which he was hiding in Watertown, outside . Boston, moments before his violent capture. The note accuses the United States government of killing . Muslims and says 'I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished'. It adds: 'I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in . Islam but due to said (...) it is allowed.' Words were missing . from the note due to bullet holes. Jurors were also presented with Tsarnaev's Twitter posts, . which ranged from jokes about girls, food, and homework, to . musings about Islam and a reference to the Sept. 11, 2001, . attacks on New York and Washington. After opening with three days of emotional and graphic testimony by witnesses including nine people injured in the attack, Tsarnaev's trial has moved into to a more technical phase as prosecutors show evidence about the bombs and communication between the two brothers. Despite the admission that opened the trial, Tsarnaev's not guilty plea stands, leaving it to the federal government to prove his guilt before the trial moves into a second phase, when the jury will determine whether to sentence him to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. The Boston bombers are seen moving through the crowds at the 2013 marathon.

"Naz Shah, who has been selected to fight the seat of Bradford West, was brought up in extreme poverty and forced into marriage aged 15 . A Labour candidate for Parliament has spoken of her extraordinary life as the daughter of a convicted murderer. Women’s rights campaigner Naz Shah, who was selected last week to fight the seat of Bradford West against George Galloway, also suffered marriage at the age of 15, violence and poverty. She was praised on social media yesterday after publishing a remarkable account of how her life has been defined by extreme poverty and violence. In an emotive open letter, she described growing up in Bradford in extreme poverty and becoming homeless aged six after her father left his family destitute when he eloped with a 16-year-old neighbour. She was forced to be a parent to her two sisters after her mother, who had suffered years of abuse at the hands of a local drug dealer, was jailed for his murder after she poisoned him. Mrs Shah’s mother, Zoora, was released from prison in 2000 after serving 14 years for putting poison into the food of Mohammed Azam, a local drug dealer she feared was planning to sexually abuse her daughters. He had helped her to obtain a mortgage so the family would no longer be homeless, but demanded sex in return. Mrs Shah, a mother-of-three, became active in politics after campaigning to free her mother, Zoora. She will be opposing Respect MP Mr Galloway in May’s general election. Yesterday she described being forced into an arrange marriage in Pakistan, when she was under the age of consent, to a man who was violent towards her. She had been sent to live with family in Pakistan when she was 12 to escape Azam. In her account, published by the website Urban Echo, Ms Shah recalled how she returned to Britain after leaving her own husband, who she claimed ‘used his fists to communicate’, to become ‘a mother to my two siblings’. She wrote: ‘I was only six when my father abandoned my mother with two young children and pregnant with a third when he eloped with the neighbour’s 16 year old daughter. ‘I remember been thrown into the back of a taxi with black bin liners full of our belongings and packed off from the family home. ‘We never really saw the end of black bin liners over the next few years as we moved from squalor to squalor, 14 times in less than two years, from back to back houses where the toilet was outside to rat infested damp houses where we lived and slept in just one room. Zoora Shah (left) served 14 years for the murder of Mohammed Azam after poisoning the drug dealer's food when she feared he planned to sexually abuse her daughters . ‘My mother’s attempt to provide her children with the security of a home came at the expense of being abused by Azam over years. A man that she thought would save her children from an uncertain and insecure future, little did she know he would be the exact opposite. ‘My mother had sent me to Pakistan at the age of 12 when she felt I was at risk of his abuse. Last week I was selected to stand as the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Bradford West, where I was born and raised, and where I am raising my own family. ‘I was only six when my father abandoned my mother with two young children and pregnant with a third when he eloped with the neighbour’s 16-year-old daughter. ‘I remember being thrown into the back of a taxi with black bin liners full of our belongings and packed off from the family home ...we never really saw the end of black bin liners over the next few years as we moved from squalor to squalor. ‘[Our new home] was purchased with the sale of my mother’s wedding jewellery but in someone else’s name, Azam’s name. My mother’s attempt to provide her children with the security of a home came at the expense of being abused by Azam. ‘Following years of anti-depressants, failed suicide attempts and feeling desperate and destitute she snapped. She killed the man who abused her. ‘My world was turned upside down, how I became a mother to my two siblings who were 11 and 13 at the time ... I remember the first day I visited my mother in prison, when I left it was like leaving a crying child at nursery for the first time. I now became a mother to my mother. ‘For me to be selected as a Prospective Parliamentary Candidate is not really about me, it’s the dream of my mother... When I expressed my interest last year for politics ... my mother understood that her story from 22 years ago would resurface, it would open up wounds, but she blessed me as she knew it’s what made me this way. ‘When my younger sister was growing up and my mother felt she was now at risk, and following years of antidepressants, failed suicide attempts and feeling desperate and destitute she snapped. 'She killed the man who abused her.’ Mrs Shah said she was forced to become a mother to her sisters, who were aged 11 and 13. She did not return to school and instead got a job laundering linen for local hospitals. ‘My life now revolved around solicitor and prison visits,’ she said. ‘I didn’t know how to run a house. ‘I remember the first day I visited my mother at New Hall Prison, when I left it was like leaving a crying child at nursery for the first time, I now became a mother to my mother. We lost the house, we lost everything and the moving around started all over again.’ Mrs Shah left her abusive husband in 1992 and went back to college. She began working with women’s groups to campaign for her mother’s release. While working as a carer with disabilities, she was advised to join the NHS where she began to rise through the ranks and became politically active. She added: ‘Last week I was selected to stand as the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Bradford West, where I was born and raised, and where I live and am raising my own family. ‘Later on that evening on the journey back from London my friend asked me how I felt. I responded I would know once I was in my mother’s arms.’ Describing her mother’s reaction to her selection as the local candidate, she added: ‘When I did finally get home that night I was selected, my mother sat up in her bed and held me close whilst I cried. ‘We cried together knowing that whilst my past and my present are the dreams of my mother and her inspiration for me, my future is about the dreams I have for my own daughter. She is my inspiration to bring change and equality for the world in which she is growing up in, the community we live in and the wider society.’ The politician campaigned for her mother's release at the High Court.

"Kevin Mitchell, pictured, threatened to slit his victim's throat before raping her in her own apartment in New York on September 19, 2013 . A convicted rapist sentenced to 14 years  has been granted a marriage licence to wed his long-term girlfriend so he can receive conjugal visits while in prison. Kevin Mitchell violently attacked the 30-year-old woman inside her own apartment in New York in the early hours of the morning, threatening her that he had a gun and would slit her throat. Mitchell, 34, pleaded guilty to one count of Rape in the First Degree at Manhattan Supreme Court on February 11, 2015. However, instead of being sent straight to a state penitentiary in upper New York State immediately, Mitchell was granted a one-month stay in Rikers Island so he could get married to Tyneka Hudson. Ms Hudson told the New York Daily News following her would-be husband's sentence: 'I'm going to stay by his side. He's a good man.' Prosecutors claim that Mitchell followed his victim into her apartment at 5.30am on the day of the attack. However, Ms Hudson questions the verdict. She said: 'No one knows the real story. Only she and him know. I can’t say he did it. I can’t say he didn’t do it. He told me he didn’t rape the lady. He said they were drinking and he put a hickey on her. I don’t know what he was doing in her apartment.' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr said: 'This lengthy prison sentence reflects the extremely violent nature of this attack, in which Kevin Mitchell raped a woman in her own home. 'I would like to thank the survivor for coming forward, and my office’s Sex Crimes prosecutors for ensuring that this predator will serve years behind bars.' Prosecutor Siobhan Carty told Manhattan Supreme Court that Mitchell surreptitiously entered the woman's apartment on September 19, 2013 at 5.30am and threatened her with a knife and said he had a gun. After the attack, the victim rang 911 and NYPD's Warrant Squad arrested Mitchell four days later. Ms Carty read the victim's statement into the court record in advance of Mitchell's sentencing. She said on behalf of the victim: 'This man has completely ruined my life. I have tried to rationalise what I could have done in my life to have deserved what happened to me. The only conclusion that I have come up with is that some people in this world are truly terrible.' 'I cannot understand why the man did this to me. Why he told me he would kill me if I didn’t do what he said. 'I do not know if he raped me because I only had $24, or if that was the initial reason that he broke into my apartment. If he had broken into my apartment to assault me, then why did he make me talk to him for so long? 'I was trapped in my own home for what felt like forever talking to this man and not knowing if he was going to kill me or my dog — he made it clear to me that he was very capable of both.' Mitchell has been told he can remain on Rikers Island, pictured, until next month so he can marry his girlfriend Tyneka Hudson and receive conjugal visits when he is sent to a prison in upstate New York . The statement added: 'I gave him so many chances to leave. I told him multiple times that if he left right then nothing bad would happen. He raped me anyways.' It is claimed that Mitchell was drinking at the time of the attack and told his victim 'I'll slit your throat. This is going to happen either way.' As well as receiving a 14-year jail term, Mitchell was ordered to undergo 10 years' post release supervision.","Kevin Mitchell attacked the woman in her home on September 19, 2013 .

The Duke of Edinburgh was seen enjoying the spring-like weather today while driving a carriage of four horses through the Windsor town centre . He is even credited with developing the sport - and an early carriage driving rule book was drafted under his supervision. He began driving ponies, before progressing to Cleveland Bay horses. By 1973 he felt that he was suitably proficient to take up the sport competitively and he still enters carriage driving competitions today having achieved several wins in regional competitions. In his book ‘30 years on and off the box seat’ The Duke of Edinburgh describes the appeal of the sport: ‘I am getting old, my reactions are getting slower, and my memory is unreliable, but I have never lost the sheer pleasure of driving a team through the British countryside. 'I have been fortunate to have had a longer innings than most, and I have no intention of giving up while I have a team of willing ponies and dedicated staff and while I can still cope with the challenges which carriage driving presents me with.’ The prince looked healthy and happy during his trip out in the sunshine earlier this week. The 93-year-old is an avid carriage driver - taking up the sport in 1971 after giving up polo . In recent years, the prince has suffered several bouts of ill-health, however, the most serious of which was over Christmas 2011 when he was rushed into hospital for emergency heart surgery after suffering a blocked artery, which involved him having a stent fitted. He was also forced to pull out of several key engagements to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 having developed a severe bladder infection after being forced to stand for hours in driving wind and rain during a celebratory river pageant.

Yet aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade Philip to slow down, with one saying: ‘No one would ever dare tell him to take it easy - you might as well take your life in your hands.’ 'The Duke cannot bear anyone making a fuss.'","Prince Philip squinted against the sun as horses trotted along the road .

"A primary school headteacher has banned pupils from watching this Friday's solar eclipse on health and safety grounds. In a letter sent to parents, Paul Rooke claimed New Machar  school in Aberdeenshire would not take 'risks around pupil safety and wellbeing' during this Friday's rare cosmic event. Parents have spoken out about the overzealous measures, suggesting the children should be given the chance to see the phenomenon - but the school says the protective glasses are not suitable for children under ten. Ban: New Machar school in Aberdeenshire, above, will not allow children to watch the eclipse on Friday . In Mr Rooke's letter, he wrote: 'It is with disappointment that I need to advise you that we will no longer be purchasing the solar eclipse glasses and viewing the eclipse as a school. 'This is after further careful consideration of the health and safety advice, alongside guidance from Aberdeenshire Council's Health and Safety colleagues. 'Clearly the school will never take any risks around pupil safety and wellbeing. I do hope you understand my decision.' Staring directly at an eclipse carries the risk of permanent damage or even blindness unless specialist lenses or devices are used. Although the moon is expected to block out 98 per cent of the sun's light, even staring at the remainder of it for too long can cause irreparable damage to the eye. Mr Rooke referred to an online report which suggested the protective glasses may be too big to be worn securely by children, and that children under ten should only watch the eclipse on TV or with an indirect viewer. The partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on Friday, March 20, and will be visible for thousands of kilometres . Parents of the pupils at Newmachar Primary in Aberdeenshire said they were disappointed they would miss out on witnessing the phenomenon, which will not reoccur in Britain until 2026. One parent, Euan Pittendreigh, said: 'It just seems like a little bit too much political correctness. 'I understand that it's for the kids' safety, but if the glasses fit my kids correctly I'd let them see it.' Another father, Derek Mathers, added: 'It's a shame. My daughter Kirsty was looking forward to seeing the eclipse, but the school has got to put safety first really.' Maria Walker, Aberdeenshire Council's director of education and children's services, said: 'Schools will decide individually on activities to watch the eclipse and will do so safely.' The last solar eclipse of a similar size took place on 11 August 1999 and had an eclipse magnitude of 1.029. An eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the sun's diameter obscured by the moon. It is based on a ratio of diameters and differs from an eclipse obscuration, which is a measure of the sun's surface area covered by the moon. The value given is taken at the moment when the eclipse is at is maximum. The maximum of two minutes and 23 seconds of totality for the 1999 eclipse occurred close to Ramnicu Valcea in Romania. It was said to have been the first total eclipse visible in Europe since 22 July 1990, and the first visible in the UK since 29 June 1927. Local councillor Fergus Hood added: 'Some might say this is health and safety gone mad but I think the school is doing the right thing to protect the children's eyesight.' New Machar is not the first school to make the ruling. Whitchurch Primary School in Cardiff said it will not let children watch the natural display outside, even if they have bought special glasses with solar filters. Instead, the primary school will show the eclipse on a live feed inside the school premises. The decision came following an email which was reportedly sent to the schools by Cardiff Council. The memo advised schools to read a leaflet from the Royal Astronomical Society on how to observe an eclipse safely. The partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on Friday, March 20, and will be visible for thousands of kilometres. It will be the first time that the astronomical spectacle has occurred during rush-hour in the UK, and there are fears that motorists may take their eyes off the wheel to watch the cosmic alignment. Experts have warned that drivers may be dazzled as they watch the sun or risk a crash simply by letting their concentration falter. The proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near-total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the UK, so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in London, Manchester will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The most 'complete' eclipse in the UK will be see from Lerwick in the Shetland Isles. Timeings will vary, so that in London, the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun's edge - will begin at 8.24am. The eclipse will peak at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. By 10.41am, the moon will leave the sun's edge and the partial eclipse will end. Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine . Do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse? 'It's all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening, but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes, binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight. 'That's not to say that you can't watch the eclipse on Friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection. Many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse - they can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers . 'Dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk. However, unless you already own one, know somebody who does or are looking to get into solar astronomy, they can be a massive investment of several hundred pounds. 'There are cheaper ways to observe the eclipse, though.' Are solar glasses fine to use? 'Many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse. These can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers. 'They work by employing a Mylar film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun's light, allowing you to view the eclipse safely. 'Before using them though, you should make sure that they are not damaged in any way and you should ensure that you have bought them from a reputable dealer. If you're in doubt, don't use your viewers at all.'","Head Paul Rooke sent letter to parents to say pupils couldn't watch eclipse .

"Amanda Knox could receive millions in compensation after being cleared by Italy's top court of murdering Surrey student Meredith Kercher. The 27-year-old and her former lover Raffaele Sollecito both served four years in prison after being convicted of the murder in 2007. But two days after being acquitted, she vowed to return to Italy - just two days after being cleared of murdering the British while living in the country. It is also understood that Knox - who was reportedly paid £2.7million ($4million) for her 2013 book Waiting to Be Heard - will write about the country's judicial system while she is there. Scroll down for video . Amanda Knox has vowed to return to Italy just two days after being cleared of murdering British student Meredith Kercher. She is pictured (left) speaking after Friday's decision and (right) after her initial acquittal in October 2011 . Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Carlo Dalla Vedova, her Italian lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Mr Sollecito’s father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' Mr Dalla Vedova added Miss Knox will go back to Italy after spending some time with her family in America. 'She loves Italy. She always says she wants to come back,’ The Sunday Times reported Mr Dalla Vedova as saying. 'Certainly she will be back in Italy, she always liked Italy, that's why she came here.’ Mr Vedova was speaking after Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, now 31, were cleared of murdering her former roommate. Knox, who served four years in prison after being convicted of the murder of Kercher (left) alongside ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (right) in 2007, 'loves' Italy, her lawyer said . The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation is the final ruling in the seven-year case and definitively ends the gruelling legal battle. The pair always maintained their innocence. Shortly after the verdict, Knox, who previously said she would never willingly return to Italy, released a statement. It said she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal'. She added: 'Throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, friends and strangers. To them, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me.' Sollecito discovered his conviction had been overturned when his lawyer called him from outside court with the news, exclaiming: 'You have your whole life ahead of you now, Raf.' Both Sollecito and Knox were imprisoned shortly after Kercher's body was discovered with 47 separate wounds on November 1, 2007. They were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively. A view of the house where British student Kercher was killed. It is understood Knox will go back to Italy to write a book about the country's legal system . Knox and Sollecito were pictured embracing as police searched the house immediately after Kercher's death . Knox breaks down in tears after hearing the verdict that overturned her original conviction and acquitted her in October 2011 . But after they served four years in prison a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent. Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years. Judge Gennaro Marasca read the decision to finally acquit the pair on Friday after a judicial body had deliberated for ten hours. It was met with stunned silence. The pair could now seek compensation. Although the amount is not known it could reach up to seven figures. Speaking shortly after the verdict Kercher's mother Arline said she was 'shocked' at the decision to overturn the convictions. Knox talks on her mobile phone from her mother's Seattle home just moments after hearing Friday's news. After the verdict she said she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal' She said: 'I am a bit surprised and very shocked if I'm honest. I don't know what to say.' A statement released by the family later said: 'Emotions are naturally raw at this stage. The decision came as a shock but was an outcome we knew was possible, even if it wasn't what we expected.' Rudy Guede is now the only person to be successfully convicted of the murder. The unemployed basketball player was found guilty in October 2008 and was convicted to 16 years after his footprints were discovered in Kercher's blood. The court will publish its reasons for Friday's decision within 90 days.

"A filmmaker is hoping a Kickstarter will help her finish Dennis Hopper's last movie, five years after his death. Director Linda Yellen along side Michael Leeds co-wrote the comedy The Last Film Festival, starring Dennis Hopper, Jacqueline Bisset, JoBeth Williams, Chris Kattan, Donnell Rawlings, Katrina Bowden, Joseph Cross and Leelee Sobieski. They began filming in 2009, but production ended with only five scenes left to shoot when Hopper, best known for his role in Easy Rider, died from cancer in 2010, aged 74. Scroll down for video . Linda Yellen (left) was a co-writer on Dennis Hopper's (right) final film before his death, The Last Film Festival. Five years after Hopper's passing, she decided it's time to finish the project . After Hopper's passing the cast and crew set aside the project until this year, when Yellen decided to pick it up. 'There's a wonderful thing that happens with time - perspective - and it was so hard for us to look at after he had died,' Yellen told Deadline. 'What forced me back into the editing room was the constant chatter on the Internet and emails wondering about the film, and we now feel we could do it without the pain that we once felt. 'That's the beauty of being an independent filmmaker you can put it on hold.' Yellen said she, the cast and crew only found out about Hopper's cancer just shortly before he died. 'He was a picture of health and vitality and he just gives a multilevel comedic act [in the film],' Yellen said. 'He had no idea he was sick; we had no idea he was sick.' Yellen hopes to raise $90,000 to finish The Last Film Festival (pictured above). In the film, Hopper plays a Hollywood producer who's film was rejected by every film festival except the small town O'Hi Film Festival . She turned to Kickstarter with a goal of raising at least $90,000 in hopes of reaching fans directly and using Hopper's idea of 'always looking for ways to go around the system', according to the Queens Courier. Though she reached her goal on Sunday night, the Kickstarter page will be open until April 9. The film is about the life of a Hollywood producer, played by Hopper, who's movie was rejected by every film festival except one: a small festival in the town of O'Hi. Though it takes place in a small town, the movie was actually filmed in Queens, including parts of Astoria and Forest Hills, where Yellen grew up, according to Fox News. The funds raised from the campaign will pay for post-production aspects, including sound, special effects, obtaining rights to use footage from other movies and editing. 'This is a way of [the fans] saying we want this and we want to say we support this film and this comedy,' Yellen told the Courier. 'This picture was made as a labor of love. Just the pleasure of doing good work and wanting it out there and wanting people to laugh a lot.' Visit the Kickstarter page to donate funds toward finishing the film.

"A Florida church that hosted naked paint parties and slumber-party Sundays featuring the 'sexiest ladies on the beach' has lost its tax-exempt status. The News Herald of Panama City reports The Life Center: A Spiritual Community has been operating a seven-day-a-week party called Amnesia: The Tabernacle since February 28 as thousands of college students arrived in the Florida town for the spring break season. A sign on the door says events are alcohol and drug free, but Sheriff Frank McKeithen calls the party atmosphere a 'blatant slap in the face' to taxpayers. He says church officials are 'trying to get around the laws. Scroll down for video . A Panama Beach City, Florida church has lost its tax-exempt status as police investigate the parties held nightly at the religious building for college students on spring break . The company that organizes the events at the Life Center church (called the Tabernacle for parties) says they are completely drug and alcohol free. Above, a view inside The Tabernacle on Saturday . Patrons are charged a 'donation' of $20 at the door. On the walls inside are T-shirts emblazoned with obscene gestures and signs that say 'I hate being sober.' Additionally, Amnesia was staying open until 5am thanks to its church status, which is not under the city ordinance that clubs and bars close at 2am. This led Property Appraiser Dan Sowell to change the tax exempt status. 'A bottle club, charging $20 at the door and selling obscene T-shirts is not being used as a church,' Sowell said. 'A God-fearing, God-honoring church in January does not sponsor this type of debauchery in March.' Mark Q Bishop, the former pastor at Faith Christian Family Church, is the owner of the building. In 2004, Bishop was hit with another tax issue when county officials challenged him listing his 10,000-square-foot house as tax-exempt as a parsonage. The rulings were mostly in favor of Bishop, but he has allagedly changed the tax status of the property. The issue for authorities isn't so much the parties themselves, but the fact that the church continues to not pay property taxes as a religious buildings despite holding several club-like events .

'The primary motivation is a love of history, a love of the beauty and the lore of the coin. 'In the top-tier pieces, some of it is just bragging rights: '""I have something you don't.""' The auction catalog read: 'The Birch cent is, simply, the first of a cultural phenomenon that is known the world over - it is the first American cent.' Stack's Bowers Galleries of Irvine, California, organized the auction and they was happy with the sale price . The buyer was not identified, but the coin - which was engraved the year Congress created the US Mint, and nine years after the American Revolutionary War - was the second Birch Penny to be sold this year. The man who ended up with the coin said he was from Texas. The first was snapped up by a Beverly Hills rare coin dealer in January for $2.585million at an auction in Florida. Kevin Lipton, 55, had the winning bid for that penny. He said: 'It's like our very first penny. 'It's such a spectacular coin. It's so important, so rare. 'They are literally Mona Lisas of our coinage.' The coin Lipton bought was previously sold in 1981 for $200,000. Named for engraver Robert Birch, the penny sold on Thursday depicts Lady Liberty encircled by the words 'Liberty parent of science and industry.' The flip side is engraved with 'United States of America,' 'One cent,' and the fraction 1/100.","Anonymous man from Texas bought pricey coin in Maryland on Thursday .

"Slasher: Richard White, 63, died in hospital Saturday afternoon, the night after he was gunned down while trying to hack a TSA worker to death . The machete-wielding maniac who was gunned down as he tried to hack a TSA worker to death has died in hospital. Richard White, 63, charged at Carol Richel at a security checkpoint inside New Orleans airport Friday evening - but was stopped in his tracks by a female cop. He was carrying a sack of six Molotov cocktails during the attack, but was not able to detonate them. Lt Heather Slyve, of the Jefferson Parish sheriff's department, shot White in the chest, the thigh and the face as he lunged at Richel. He was rushed to hospital Friday evening and went into surgery, but died of his wounds around 4pm Saturday, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Earlier that day Richel had hailed Lt Slyve as her 'hero', saying she would certainly be dead if it weren't for her fatal intervention. Speaking at a press conference, Richel said: 'Officer Slyve is my hero. She saved my life. 'The man was within inches of whacking me with the machete and she did save my life, and saved probably a lot of others.' When he was shot, White was carrying a bag loaded with six Molotov cocktails - Mason jars with cloth wicks soaked in gasoline - Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said. There was also reportedly a barbeque lighter and a letter opener in his bag, while smoke bombs and tanks of acetelyne (an explosive), Freon (an aerosol) and oxygen were discovered in the trunk of White's parked car. Scroll down for video . Saved: TSA employee Carol Richel, above, was inches from being slash by White. She today paid tribute to Lt Heather Slyve, the cop who saved her from the attack at New Orleans's Louis Armstrong International Airport . Dead: White is pictured above last night being wheeled out of the airport. He was in surgery last night but died 4pm Saturday of his wounds . Gunned down: White is pictured above where he fell, not far from the machete . But despite his stash of weapons, he only managed to spray several people with the insecticide, and swing his machete without hitting anybody before he was shot. In the struggle Richel herself was hit by one of Lt Slyve's shots. She later explained that she and her colleagues are trained for such situations, saying: 'It was second nature'. She explained: 'We want to make sure the passengers are safe, so we tell them ""run, run, you've got to get out of here, run"". And with that, we know they're leaving,' according to CNN. However, Richel said that because TSA officials do not carry guns, she was forced to rely on police to save her life, saying: 'They're the ones there with the weapons to be able to protect us.' 'Second nature': During the press conference, Richel (pictured front) said she and her colleagues had been trained how to react in such a situation, saying: 'It was second nature'. She said passenger safety came first . Injured: White was in possession of a bag loaded with six Molotov cocktails when he launched the attack, Sheriff Newell Normand said. Above, Richel is pictured being transported to an ambulance via stretcher . 'Senseless act of violence': This statement was posted on the TSA's Twitter page on Saturday afternoon . After White attacked two security officials and a number of passersby with the wasp spray at the airport's security checkpoint, he drew his machete from the waistband of his pants. He then started swinging the weapon, which a male TSA agent managed to block with a piece of luggage as White ran through a metal detector, Normand said earlier on Saturday. Seconds later, White began chasing Richel, prompting Lt Slyve to fire three rounds at him, striking him the face, chest and leg. White was then rushed to hospital, where he had surgery. According to authorities, residue from smoke bombs was  found near White's body at the security checkpoint. Hurt: An injured man - possibly a passenger who was hurt while fleeing the scene - is pictured at the airport . On guard: Police clear out the area around Concourse B of Louis Armstrong International Airport on Friday evening . Emergency response: Police poured into the airport  and ushered everybody away from the area where the shooting took place . The sheriff suggested that White has had 'mental health' issues. He is a Jehovah's Witness and has refused 'certain types of medical care,' Normand said. His family is cooperating with investigators. 'Fortunately, he didn't seriously injure anybody,' Normand said. Richel, a Supervisory Security Officer for the Transportation Security Administration, was struck in the arm by one of Lt Slyve's rounds while running from White. Her wound was quickly deemed non-life-threatening. She was treated in hospital and released hours later. Earlier reports had wrongly stated that Richel was slashed by White's machete. Photographs from inside Louis Armstrong International Airport Friday showed White laying on the floor with a machete close-by. Another showed a woman in a TSA uniform being stretchered away. Attack: White reportedly began swinging the weapon at the airport's security checkpoint, which a male TSA agent managed to block with a piece of luggag. Above, officers stand at the entrance to the airport . Other images depicted police flooding the area outside the terminal. On Saturday, bystanders described minutes of panic and chaos at the airport in the New Orleans suburb of Kenner. 'Everyone was ducking for cover. It's New Orleans. I knew they (the gunshots) were coming from the security checkpoint area,' said Garret Laborde, 31, a traveler trying to fly to Houston. 'I immediately ducked down... Then we waited.' He called the scene 'instant chaos' with 'screaming, lots of females screaming for a short period of time.' Laborde said he remained down for several minutes, before police began rushing around the airport, telling everyone to get back down. Evaucation sirens also started going off, he said. Disruptive: Long lines of fliers were seen awaiting word of their departures in the airport's ticketing area on Friday evening . Protected: Officers guard the entrance to concourse A and B at the New Orleans International Airport on Friday . Logan Tucker, 26, of Meridian, Mississippi, and Phillip Green, 33, of Houston, both headed to Houston for work as deckhands on a tugboat, said they were close to where events unfolded. 'I heard the gunshots,' Tucker said. 'It was pandemonium after that,' Green said. 'I took cover. I didn't want to become part of the story. The Sheriff's Office said Friday there was no obvious connection between White and the airport. A spokesman said: 'We don't know if he was traveling. We're still piecing together witness interviews.' On Saturday, a statement revealed that White  'had a few minor arrests' to his name. At a news conference outside the airport, Normand described Friday's encounter in detail. A deputy walks through Concourse B at the airport as the sheriff's department investigates the attack . He said: 'He walked down the TSA pre-line, encountered the TSA officer who was checking the boarding passes with the scanning machine to be scanned. 'He was challenged at that time by the TSA officer. The response was, he pulled a can of wasp spray and sprayed the officer in the face. 'He proceeded past that checkpoint and encountered the second TSA officer and a third a third TSA officer almost simultaneously. One was a female, one was a male. 'He sprayed the male in the face.' Describing the shooting, he said: 'The law enforcement officer proceeded down the exit line to come around, coming in very close contact to the individual with the machete, and that officer fired three times, hitting the perpetrator once in the left chest, the left facial area and the left thigh, at that point in time. Scene: The shooting and machete attack took place at Louis Armstrong International Airport on Friday night . 'There was an innocent bystander who sustained a graze wound to the arm and there were a couple of members of the traveling public, while in the scrambling, while shots were fired, that happened to cut some limbs on some of the furniture there while trying to get away from that particular area.'","Richard White, 63, lashed out with machete and wasp spray Friday night .

"The racing driver who was the first Stig on Top Gear has said that the BBC show would lose its 'fire' without the embattled Jeremy Clarkson. Perry McCarthy, who was the show's resident racing driver between 2002 to 2003, said that Top Gear without Clarkson simply 'won't work'. He said: 'I think you're going to have a diluted product. I don't think it will have the value that it did, here and overseas.' 'And God help any soul who takes his place, because that's like signing up for your own firing squad. Scroll down for video . Perry McCarthy, who was the original Stig on Top Gear, said that Top Gear without Clarkson simply 'won't work'. He also said that  the BBC's decision to suspend Jeremy Clarkson and drop the rest of the current series of Top Gear amid allegations Clarkson punched a producer was 'a complete overreaction' The presenter told waiting reporters that he was off to have 'lunch with a friend' as he left his home yesterday . 'The only person who could take it on would be somebody who has nothing to lose.' Clarkson's future at the BBC is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in North Yorkshire. He now faces an interrogation over his row with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon by BBC chiefs, who are said to be 'desperate' to get rid of him. Ken MacQuarrie, head of BBC Scotland, is leading an inquiry into the fracas and is expected to deliver a verdict within days. Mr McCarthy went on to add that Top Gear with a 'neutered' Clarkson would not work either in the Radio Times interview. He said: 'The charm and brilliance of Jeremy are that he is a slightly loose cannon, you're not quite sure what he's going to do next. 'There is an unpredictability  coupled with creative genius. 'I think he is God's gift to British broadcasting, and a brilliant journalist.' He went on to clarify that he wasn't 'puffing him up', and that the pair weren't close, he was just very aware of his talents. Clarkson was suspended by the BBC last week after allegedly shouting at Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) The BBC owns both the Top Gear name and the format of the show, meaning that it could still air without Mr Clarkson. However, many viewers tune in specifically because of the controversial presenter, and would be unwilling to watch it without him. Top Gear averages around 5.5million viewers an episode, but a programme about the Red Arrows airing in the same slot on Sunday night only attracted 1.3million viewers. More than 935,000 people have signed an online petition to reinstate him on Top Gear, whilst Prime Minister David Cameron, a close friend of the television presenter, has said that his children would be ‘heartbroken’ if the show is taken off air on a permanent basis. The series also raises around £50million a year for the Corporation, thanks to its sales overseas. The version featuring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May is aired in some 214 territories around the world – a record for any British programme. It has also been remade for certain markets, including America and France. Some BBC insiders argue that another host could take Mr Clarkson’s place. BBC Radio 2 host Chris Evans has been tipped for the role, although he has ruled himself out of the running. The news comes as the BBC backed Clarkson's use of the word 'pikey'. The word - used as a derogatory term for gipsies or travellers - was part of a 'running gag' between Clarkson and fellow presenter James May about their colleague Richard Hammond's perceived cheap style. A complaint was lodged by the Traveller Movement charity after it appeared on a placard in a Top Gear episode from February last year. And last night Clarkson was at the centre of another controversy after he said in the March edition of Top Gear magazine that foreign taxi drivers in London have 'vehicles smelling of sick'. He also turned on drivers in the North, saying northern roads are overrun with immigrants 'who have never experienced tarmac before'. Mr McCarthy went on to add that Top Gear with a 'neutered' Clarkson would not work either. He said: 'The charm and brilliance of Jeremy are that he is a slightly loose cannon, you're not quite sure what he's going to do next.'There is an unpredictability coupled with creative genius . The inflammatory comments follow a string of racism rows. Last year, Clarkson apologised after he was filmed allegedly using the N-word in the poem 'Eeny, meeny, miney, moe'. Shortly afterwards, he used the racist term 'slope' in a show about Burma. The racing driver who was The Stig on Top Gear for eight years has said that the BBC show could thrive without the embattled Jeremy Clarkson. Ben Collins fell out with the broadcaster when it launched legal action - which it failed to win - over his decision to reveal his identity and publish his autobiography. He told Radio Times magazine that the presenter was not supportive of him in his own clash with the corporation. And he said that the BBC2 show could continue to succeed without him. Claim: Ben Collins (left), the racing driver who was The Stig (right) on Top Gear for eight years, has said that the BBC show could thrive without the embattled Jeremy Clarkson . The stuntman stated: 'Top Gear has achieved huge status and Jeremy has certainly been part of that because he's got such a big personality... he's an unstoppable force. 'But fans of the programme love it for lots of different reasons. Jeremy is certainly one of them, but not the only one,' Collins, who was The Stig until 2011, said. 'The Bond franchise.... changes and moves forward. Top Gear will always continue.... It will carry on and continue to be successful because millions of people watch it.' Mr Collins said that it had become harder for the show 'to reinvent itself', as it was 'possibly starting to strain under the weight of its own success'.","Perry McCarthy was the show's resident racing driver from 2002 to 2003 .

"A man rushed to hospital for a kidney transplant has spoken of the dilemma he faced after learning the donor organ could be infected with HIV. Tony Gartside had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney and pancreas had become available. The transplant window was so small that after putting the phone down at 3am, he was rushed from his home in Plymouth to Oxford for the operation. But upon arriving, he was  told that the organs had come from the victim of a drugs overdose - and it would be two weeks before tests revealed if they were HIV free. Tony Gartside, 40, had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney had become available. But he faced a dilemma after learning the donor organ could be infected with HIV . Mr Gartside, 40, was born with type 1 diabetes, and his kidneys began to fail by the time he was 32. He said: 'They showed me into a room and told me the donor organs had come from a death by drug overdose and asked if I still wanted to go ahead. 'Because the person died by drug overdose, they wouldn't know whether the donor had HIV for two weeks. 'It was a scary process having to say yes or no after sitting in the back of an ambulance for hours. 'I thought: ""Do I risk it and say yes, or do I say no and wait another 18 months, or even longer?"" 'In the end, I went ahead with it.' The kidney transplant surgery took 10 hours and left Mr Gartside with 32 staples in his stomach. After the surgery, he was sick for days, unable to even stand up straight, and was concerned about the risk of HIV. Two weeks later the HIV results came back - and were, to his relief, negative. He has since made a full recovery. Mr Gartside said: 'My diabetes has completely changed - it's amazing - and even that doesn't describe how good I feel. 'It's a second chance and I will be forever grateful to the donor's parents for making that decision.' Two weeks after the kidney transplant, the HIV results came back - and were negative . He has now set up a support group for transplant patients - the Mayflower Support Group - which supports patients going through the transplant procedure. He explained: 'Doctors have the clinical experience and can tell you what's going to happen during surgery, but they don't have a realistic explanation of what is going to happen for the patient. 'It's good to have someone to talk to who has been through what they're about to go through. 'The transplant has made me feel like I really want to give something back.' Last year, two patients in Wales died after being given kidney transplants infected with a parasitic worm. Darren Hughes, 42, and Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were each given a kidney from a transplant donor who was carrying the deadly worm in his organs when he died. Doctors were not aware the donor had the worm - known as Halicephalobus, which lives in soil and is found in horses - when the transplant operations were carried out at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes began to 'deteriorate rapidly' after their surgery and died less than three weeks later. The two men are part of only five cases ever recorded across the world - and all have died from the worm infection. Mr Stuart, of Cardiff, and Mr Hughes, of Bridgend, had kidney transplants in November 2013 but both died before Christmas. A post-mortem examination revealed they both died from infection called Meningeoencephaltis which was caused by the parasitic worm.","Tony Gartside, 40, had waited 4 years for a donor kidney and pancreas .

"Forget girly girls names and macho boys names - unisex is the latest trend when it comes to celebrity babies for 2015. Among the celeb offspring recently welcomed into the world  are supermodel Coco Rocha and husband James Conran's little girl Ioni,   Hollywood heart throb Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively daugher James and Mad Men actress Jessica Pare's son Blues. Rocha, 26, announced the birth of her baby girl on Twitter on Saturday and shared a snap of her bundle of joy, wearing only a nappy and mittens, with the caption: 'James & I are so proud to welcome into the world our healthy and beautiful baby girl, Ioni James Conran! #ioniconran'. Scroll down for video . Coco Rocha and James Conran have named their baby girl Ioni James - her first name means island . Coco Rocha and husband James Conran's daughter Ioni James is the latest celebrity baby with a unisex name . Last week Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively revealed the name of their daughter who was born in December. James is traditionally a boys name meaning 'supplanted', and is derived from the Hebrew name Jacob. In an interview with the Today Show Reynolds ended months of speculation and finally confirmed his daughter's name. He joked: 'It is Butternut Summersquash. No, it's out there! It's out there. It's James. Everyone knows and I told everyone who would listen that.' Coco Rocha with her daughter Ioni James . Finally! Ryan Reynolds revealed he and wife Blake Lively have called their daughter James . James Reynolds, who has been kept tightly under wraps since her birth in December, could be 'Jamie' for short like the actress Jamie King, who answered to James earlier in her career. And as well as choosing a non-gender specific name sports illustrated model Robyn Lawley says she plans to raise her daughter Ripley, born in February, in a 'gender neutral' environment with unisex toys and clothes. In her first interview since Ripley's arrival Lawley told Brands Exclusive magazine: 'I think we separate the genders too greatly by the toys and hobbies.' Actors Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher have gone down the same unisex route by naming their daughter Wyatt, an Anglo-French surname that means 'brave at war'. The couple came up with the moniker at a Lakers Game. Sixteen girls were named Wyatt in America last year compared to almost 8,500 boys, according to the baby name website nameberry.com . Model Robyn Lawley says she plans to raise her daughter Ripley in a 'gender neutral' environment . Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher, left, chose Wyatt for their baby daughter while Kim Kardashian and daughter North West, right, both have unisex names . But reality TV stars the Kardashians trump the lot with four unisex names between them. There's 'momager' Kris, Kim, who shares her name with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, her daughter North West and model half-sister Kendall. And the Kardashians, like Taylor Swift, Cameron Diaz, Reece Witherspoon and Drew Barrymore, prove that having a traditionally male name doesn't hinder future success. Yet baby name experts and nameberry.com founders Pamela Redmond Satran and Linda Rosenkrantz say once boys names are adopted for girls, parents tend to abandon them for boys altogether. The duo told The Huffington Post: 'It's been a truism that once unisex names become widely used for girls, parents abandon them for boys. 'Now we see a welcome reverse of that sexist trend with boys reclaiming names that had long been going toward the girls.' 'Most recent statistics see boys taking back ground on such popular unisex names as Alexis, Carey and  Casey.' And it seems James could become an even more popular choice before the year is out. Ladbrokes have 6/1 odds on James being the name given to the new royal baby when Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge welcome their second child next month. And as we all know, where the Duchess of Cambridge leads, millions follow. Sarah Short with her daughter Robyn, who she says strangers sometimes mistake for a boy unless she is dressed in pink . First time mum Sarah Short, pictured, and her husband Adam, 32, decided to call their daughter Robyn because Robin is Sarah's dad's middle name and Adam's dad is called Robert, which is derived from Robin. But six months after little Robyn was born in September 2014 Sarah, 28, from Rotherfield, East Sussex, says unless she dresses her daughter in anything other than pink strangers think she's a boy. Sarah says: 'I do get asked a lot whether she's a boy or girl, and I've stopped correcting people sometimes when they think she's a boy. 'We didn't even think about that when choosing her name - I just thought Robyn was such a cute name. 'We wanted a name that nobody had and I don't regret our decision.

"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Thursday castigated President Barack Obama for setting a 'tone' that inspires violent behavior in America and advocated for him to emulate Bill Cosby when it comes to talking about black crime. He also told radio host John Gambling during an interview on AM 970 THE ANSWER that Obama is ignoring 'enormous amounts of crime' being committed by blacks. Roughly '70 percent' of homicides in New York City are committed by African Americans, Giuliani said. 'There are many, many extremely understandable' reasons for that both historically and environmentally, he added. 'And if an African-American president stood up and said - I hate to mention it because of what happened afterwards - the kinds of stuff that Bill Cosby used to say. The kinds of stuff that Imam Pasha says at the Malcolm X Mosque: This is our responsibility,' he said, trailing off into an explanation of Pasha's doctrine. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City, waves to public during a conference in Berlin, Germany last Saturday. Fresh off his trip abroad, Giuliani contended on Thursday that internationally, America is considered a 'racist state' Imam Izak-EL Mu'eed Pasha is a black, Muslim leader in New York who Giuliani has been friends with more than a decade. I remember Pasha saying to his congregation, if there were less crime in the community, there would be less police in our community, Giuliani recalled. When referencing Cosby, the retired New York politician was referring to allegations that surfaced last year that black actor raped or otherwise sexually assaulted number of former cast-mates and other women throughout the '60s, 70s and 80s. Prior to that 'America's Dad' had earned a reputation for forcefully encouraging African-American teens to clean up their act and make better use of the educational system their ancestors fought to earn access to. In on memorable - and controversial - address Cosby touched on the perils of stealing and defended police against charges of racism. Now known as 'the Pound Cake speech', Cosby said, 'These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake. 'Then we all run out and are outraged: ""The cops shouldn’t have shot him."" What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?' Cosby asked. 'I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else. And I looked at it and I had no money. And something called parenting said, ""If you get caught with it, you’re going to embarrass your mother.” ' 'America's mayor' has made a few contentious statements of his own as of late, saying late last month he's not sure, based on the president's upbringing and behavior, that Obama 'loves America.' After several days of spinning, and counter claims that he had racist intent when the made the derogatory remarks about the nation's first black president, Giuliani finally ended the media-frenzy by penning an op-ed in which he explained that he simply wishes the president would speak more highly of American exceptionalism. Striving to avoid another kerfuffle, Giuliani was careful to balance out his criticisms of Obama on AM 970 with a note of goodwill to the president. 'I disagree with Barack Obama on almost everything, but I think Barack Obama's a good family man, and he's a good man.' 'This is the model we need,' he said of the positive example Obama is setting for the African American communities as a father and a husband. Earlier in the interview, Giuliani suggested the savage beating of a 15-year-old girl in a Brooklyn McDonald's on Monday, the shooting of two Ferguson police officers this morning and an incident at a city council meeting involving NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, at which 20 protester heckled him until they were led out by the cops, all occurred because Obama hadn't done more to verbally build up America's police. 'It all starts at the top. It’s the tone that’s set by the President,' Giuliani said on radio station AM 970 THE ANSWER. President Barack Obama, pictured here boarding Air Force One today, should seek to emulate Bill Cosby when it comes to talking about crimes committed by blacks, Giuliani contended, prefacing the statement with his loathe to mention Cosby 'because of what happened afterwards' Giuliani, who just returned stateside following a conference in Germany on 'Tolerance and Equality against Fundamentalism and Misogyny and says he spent a large portion of the fall traveling abroad, contended that internationally, America's police are considered to be 'racist.' 'It is the obligation of the President to explain,' to Americans and the global community 'that our police are the best in the world,' he said. They are the best trained and better restrained than police forces in other countries and fire their guns less often, Giuliani argued. 'There are very few incidents that turn out to be bad incidents,' the 2008 presidential candidate said in audio of the interview provided to Daily Mail Online by the radio station. 'And the one they tried to make out into a bad incident, Ferguson, where they all went crazy, was a man who was shot in the commission of a crime. 'And it turned out to be a justifiable homicide,' Giuliani said of the shooting of Michael Brown, citing both the state grand jury's decision not to indite police officer Darren Wilson and the Justice Department's announcement that it wouldn't bring charges against him, either. One person Obama should not be listening to or promoting Giuliani said is Rev. Al Sharpton, who is not respected by America's police of all race. Giuliani said the sentiment among police officers is, 'If you hang around Al Sharpton you must be anti-police.' 'He's gotta lose Sharpton,' Giuliani said.","In one memorable - and controversial - address Cosby suggested that people who steal are asking to get shot by the police .

But tomorrow the 62-year-old former Florida governor will capitalize on elder brother George's relationships with the Texas business community at a fundraiser in Dallas benefiting his expected bid for the Oval Office. George W. Bush, 68, and wife Laura will be the special guest at a fundraiser for his brother's Right to Rise political action committee on Wednesday at the home of billionaire Gerald Ford, the Dallas Morning News reports. Then- President George W. Bush, left, and brother, then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, acknowledge cheering supporters at a fundraiser for the Republican Party of Florida in February of 2006. Tomorrow Jeb will capitalize off elder brother George's relationships with the Texas business community at a fundraiser in Dallas benefiting his expected bid for the Oval Office . Jeb Bush visits with lawmakers after speaking on the Georgia House floor last Thursday. Bush has not formally launched a presidential campaign but is taking the necessary steps to announce a bid . Attendees will pay between $5,000 per person and $100,000 a couple to rub elbows with members of the Bush dynasty, the paper says, at a roundtable, general reception, and for the top donors, a VIP session. The 50-person guest list includes financier T. Boone Pickens, former Commerce Secretary Don Evans, who served in the George W. Bush administration, former Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and former U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler. The host, Gerald Ford is a banking executive and investor who is of no relation to former Republican president Gerald Ford. As the Dallas Morning News notes, several of Jeb's new backers such as David Weekley, the founder of the largest privately held home building company in the country, and Silver Eagle Distributors head John Nau have also donated large sums to likely George W.'s successor at the Texas statehouse - Rick Perry, another likely presidential candidate. Perry, like Bush, has not formally launched a presidential campaign but is taking the necessary steps to compete in the 2016 contest. Texas senator Ted Cruz made his own entry into the race official on Monday during a rally at a Christian college in Virginia. With the Dallas fundraiser on Wednesday Jeb Bush, born in Midland, Texas, will cash-grab in his opponents' backyards as he seeks to bolster his predominately establishment fan base with support from the conservative wing of the Republican Party. Though George W. Bush left office an unpopular president, his approval ratings have ticked upward in the years since he returned to Texas. As of last summer, he was liked nationally by roughly the same number of Americans as the current occupant of the White House, Barack Obama. Regardless of his reputation among the American public, the 43rd President of the United States and former Texas governor has amassed a sizable donor network that will no doubt come in handy for his brother on future occasions, as well. Last week Jeb received a helping hand in the fundraising department from his mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, who sent a message to his PAC's donors informing them that she'd changed her mind about her son's candidacy and is now convinced that he should seek election to the highest office in the nation. 'Jeb is our best chance of taking back the White House in 2016, and I hope that you will join me in pushing him to run,' she said in the email.","Jeb has otherwise sought to distance himself from the legacies of his father and brother while building the case for his own presidency .

"A gang enforcer convicted of beating and strangling a San Antonio woman who refused to pay a Mexican Mafia-imposed tax on her illegal drug sales is set to be executed this week. The lethal injection of Manuel Vasquez on Wednesday evening would leave Texas prison officials in the nation's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply. At least six executions are scheduled in the coming weeks in Texas, where prison officials — like in other death penalty states — have struggled to find providers for drugs for executions. Vasquez, 46, had no appeals in the courts Tuesday and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles rejected a clemency petition filed on his behalf in a 7-0 vote. Gang enforcer Manuel Vasquez, 46, is scheduled for execution on Wednesday for the ordered murder of a San Antonio woman who ignored a 10 per cent street tax on drugs known as a 'dime' Evidence at Vasquez's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra for ignoring the Mexican Mafia's 10 per cent street tax on drugs — known as a 'dime.' After a night of drinking and drugs at a run-down San Antonio motel, Vasquez and two companions barged into the nearby room of Ybarra and her boyfriend, Moses Bazan, early on March 19, 1998, according to evidence presented at his trial. Bazan was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw Ybarra being beaten, heard Vasquez holler that she was biting him and saw Vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle Ybarra. The attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry, stuffed them into a pillowcase and fled. When Bazan regained consciousness, he stumbled to the motel office to summon police. He was able to identify at least one of the attackers, leading to the arrest of all three. One of them, Johnny Joe Cruz, took a plea deal that carried a seven-year sentence and testified against Vasquez. The third man charged, Oligario Lujan, is serving a 35-year prison term. Court records show the three were carrying out orders from Mexican Mafia boss Rene Munoz, who spent years on the Texas Department of Public Safety's 10 Most Wanted List until his arrest in 2012. Joel Perez, Vasquez's lead trial lawyer, recalled last week that the motive for the slaying was 'very detrimental'. 'We have the Texas Mexican Mafia, and anyone selling drugs they collect a dime - 10 percent,' he said. 'And the motive in this case was she wasn't paying.' The lethal injection of Manuel Vasquez on Wednesday evening at Huntsville prison in Texas would leave T officials in the nation's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply . Detectives also found the blood of the victims and Vasquez's blood on clothing left in the trunk of a car he used. 'It put him at the scene when he denied being around there,' Mary Green, an assistant Bexar County district attorney who prosecuted Vasquez, said. 'I recall he was an extremely violent individual. In the punishment phase we proved up two other homicides he'd been involved with.' Vasquez had a lengthy record and had been in and out of prison at least twice. One conviction involved the beating of a man who died after his body was set on fire. Records also show Vasquez' father is serving a life sentence for a 1976 murder, and a brother and cousins are or have been in prison.","Manuel Vasquez, 46, is set for lethal injection on Wednesday evening for carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra in San Antonio, Texas .

"Richard Branson is being sued for £200million following the collapse of a joint venture with former Norwegian Cruises CEO Colin Veitch . Sir Richard Branson and his Virgin Group is being sued for £200million ($300million) by the former chief executive of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd over plans by the British billionaire to launch his own luxury cruise line. The lawsuit has been filed by Colin Veitch in Miami Federal Court, and claims that Virgin muscled him out of a joint venture to break into the industry with massive ships capable of carrying 4,200 passengers each and operating as floating resorts. Veitch alleges he presented  a plan to Virgin in 2011 to launch a new cruise line focused on two 'ultra ships' that would give it a foothold in the hard-to-enter but highly profitable luxury cruise industry, according to the complaint. Sir Richard and the Virgin Group first looked at the cruise market in the late 1970s, 'and our current team has been exploring the opportunity for more than a decade,' Virgin Group said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. 'Over the years, we have been in discussions with a number of parties including the plaintiff, and those discussions ceased in 2012. We strongly believe the claim has no merits.' Virgin in December announced the formation of Virgin Cruises, which intends to sail out of Miami. It's one of the newest of Sir Richard's numerous business ventures, which include airlines, the Virgin Galactic spacecraft, a music label, book publishing, a travel agency, hotels and mobile phone services. As CEO of the new Virgin Cruises Branson hired Tom McAlpine, former president of the Disney Cruise Line, a unit of Walt Disney Co. According to the lawsuit, the plan was initially brought to Virgin by Veitch, who after analysing the cruise industry concluded that a well-known brand such as Virgin could break into the business profitably by building a pair of so-called 'ultra' ships. These vessels, such as Royal Caribbean International's 'Oasis of the Seas' ship, feature a wide array of on-board attractions and command premium prices. Richard Branson announced in December his intention to form Virgin Cruises, that sail out of Miami, US (File Photo) The May 2011 agreement between Virgin and Veitch estimated that Virgin could make between $427 million and $483 million in profits over 10 years if the venture performed as planned. Under this deal, Veitch would get nothing if the ships were not profitable but stood to make $315 million if his projections were met. 'Upon recognizing the potential for Virgin Cruises to be one of Virgin's 'biggest, sexiest businesses,' however, the dark side of Virgin quickly emerged,' the filing says, citing language used by Branson in a video shot in 2012. Veitch claimed that Virgin later began altering the deal to diminish his earnings and leave him as 'an indentured servant whose ownership and rewards depended completely upon Virgin's whims.'","Lawsuit has been filed by former Norwegian Cruises boss Colin Veitch .

"The BBC’s music radio services have been branded too white by the Corporation’s watchdog. A review of the six stations by the BBC Trust has raised concerns that they are failing ethnic minority audiences. Radio 2 was highlighted as having particular difficulties in attracting non-white listeners and the Trust has demanded the station urgently improve and report on progress in six months. The comments echo criticisms made in 2001 by then director-general Greg Dyke, who said the BBC was ‘hideously white’ and had race relations as poor as the Metropolitan Police. While yesterday’s report accepts that the BBC has improved over recent years, it states that, ‘like BBC television, BBC radio serves BAME audiences less well than it does white listeners.’ Popular: Clara Amfo presents the Radio 1 chart show which attracts 23% of black, Asian and minority ethnic people aged 15 to 24 . BAME stands for black, Asian and minority ethnic. It pointed to statistics that show only 34 percent of BAME adults tune in to one of the six music radio stations - Radio 1, 1Xtra, Radio 2, Radio 3, 6 Music and Asian Network – each week. This compares to 49 percent of all adults regardless of ethnicity. Although the BAME figure is up from 29 percent five years ago, the Trust said the BBC must still improve further. It is a problem also faced by BBC television, with the latest figures revealing it reached 74 percent of BAME adults each week, compared with 86 percent of all adults. Radio 2 has a target audience of the over 35s but even in among this group, it failed to attract ethnic minority listeners. It reaches an average of only 12 percent each week, compared to 35 percent for all adults. The Trust said: ‘As Radio 2 has a remit to serve a broad audience over the age of 35, it should address this disparity.’ In the Trust’s previous review of music radio, Radio 1 was flagged up as of particular concern, reaching only 17 percent of BAME people aged between 15 and 24. Struggling: BBC Radio 2, which has presenters Chris Evans (left) and Jeremy Vine (right), was highlighted as having particular difficulties in attracting non-white listeners by its own watchdog . This time, the youth-oriented station has been praised for its progress, with the figure rising to 23 percent. However, this is still far lower than the 40 percent reach it has among young people nationwide regardless of ethnicity. This is not the first time in recent months that the BBC has been accused of failing ethnic minority au-diences. In a speech in December last year, the Corporation’s head of news James Harding said his de-partment better serves ‘rich, old, white people’ than those from poorer backgrounds and ethnic minorities. Yesterday’s review announced that Radio 1 was cutting back on its number of live recordings and its coverage of music festivals as part of a cost cutting drive. Also revealing that there will be ‘a small reduction’ in drama on Radio 3, it praised the stations for being ‘distinctive’ and said they played a ‘wider range’ of music than their commercial rivals. BBC Trustee Nick Prettejohn, who jointly led the review, said it made for ‘positive reading’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We aim to appeal to listeners from all backgrounds by offering a broad range of high-quality services and programming. 'Whilst listening to our music radio stations amongst BAME audiences has grown in recent years, we will continue work hard to make sure our stations represent and reach all audiences.’","Review of six stations found it was failing ethnic minority audiences .

"At least 10 Americans who might have come into contact with the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone are being flown back to the United States for observation, officials said on Saturday. The transfer comes amid concerns the citizens could have been exposed to an unidentified US health worker who recently tested positive for the disease while volunteering in West Africa. The worker was flown in a private jet to a National Institutes of Health (NIH) hospital on Friday. They are said to be in a serious condition. It is not clear how they became infected with Ebola, . The further 10 or more people who are being evacuated to the US are free of Ebola symptoms, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They will be returned on a non-commercial plane.

Above, health workers in the West African country . Treatment: The transfer comes amid concerns the citizens could have been exposed to an infected US health worker, who is now in a serious condition at the National Institutes of Health hospital (pictured) in Maryland . Upon their arrival, the Americans will be housed near the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, or Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, the CDC said. They will follow the center's  monitoring and movement guidelines during the virus's 21-day incubation period. If someone shows symptoms, they will be sent to an Ebola treatment center for evaluation. More than 10,000 people have died from Ebola - mainly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - since December 2013, the World Health Organization says. In total, 24,000 cases have been reported. However, only a handful of these cases have been seen in the United States, Spain and Britain. On Saturday, Thomas Skinner, of the CDC, said an investigation into the infected health worker - and the possible exposure of others - was ongoing, adding more Americans may be evacuated. The NIH, where the unidentified patient is being treated, is one of just four hospitals in the US to have a biocontainment units. It also has infectious disease specialists to care for Ebola patients.

Ms Pham, 26, and another nurse, Amber Vinson, who was also infected have since recovered. On Friday, the CDC sent a team to Sierra Leone to investigate how the latest healthcare worker became exposed to Ebola, and determine who may have been in contact with the infected person. CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said the center was working out a plan with the U.S. State Department to determine who was coming back and where they will be sent on their return.

Four others are being sent to Nebraska Medical Center to be near their special isolation unit in case they develop Ebola symptoms.

"The frontrunner to replace Nick Clegg as Liberal Democrat leader has savaged the way his party has conducted itself in coalition with the Tories – saying it deserves just ‘two out of 10’. In a thinly-veiled attack on the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Farron said the party should have been much braver and blocked the Conservatives’ controversial health reforms. The MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale acknowledged that the party will lose many of his seats at the election – saying he was looking forward to the ‘thrill of rebuilding’. Attack: Tim Farron, right, the front-runner to replace Nick Clegg, left, as Liberal Democrat leader has savaged the way his party conducts itself in the Coalition – saying it deserves a score of ‘two out of ten’ But he said that, despite this fall in Parliamentary strength, he would demand the same number of Cabinet ministers in any new coalition agreement. The arch comments will be seen as the latest stage in Mr Farron’s undeclared bid for leadership of the party should it suffer a catastrophe on 7 May. The Lib Dems won 57 seats at the 2010 election, meaning that when they went into Coalition with the Conservatives, they were able to argue for five Cabinet places. But the polls are so bad now – one even put the Lib Dems on 5 per cent – that the party is projected to lose half his seats in May. Some even expect Mr Clegg to lose his Sheffield Hallam seat. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Farron said the Lib Dems should ‘actively consider’ something short of a full coalition if the general election results in a hung parliament. He told the paper that he believed the party would hang on to well over half of the 57 seats they won in 2010. But he said he was already preparing to pick up the pieces. ‘What I’m absolutely ready for — you may as well be excited by it — is the thrill of rebuilding,’ he said. If Mr Clegg goes after the election, Mr Farron is seen as the front-runner to succeed him. Potential rivals such as Vince Cable, the business secretary, care minister Norman Lamb, and Ed Davey, the energy secretary, are seen as less likely to win. Mr Farron told the FT that while another coalition is possible, the Lib Dems should consider letting David Cameron or Ed Miliband form a minority government. He said the Lib Dems believe that while ‘stable government is absolutely essential’, coalition is not the only answer. ‘You really have got to be ready to walk away,’ he said. Mr Farron said the price for any formal deal should be for the Lib Dems to take ownership of one particular part of government policy. ‘For me it would be infrastructure renewal,’ he said. ‘It’s about the hard development of a kind of Victorian-style infrastructure revolution,. ‘We’re talking about South Korean levels of broadband, 3million new homes — almost all of them affordable — over a 10-year period.’ Defence: Mr Farron insisted that forming the Coalition had been the ‘grown-up’ thing to do and said his party should not be ‘punished’. Above, David Cameron and Nick Clegg outside No 10 after the 2010 election . The former Lib Dem party president said that if the Lib Dems did agree to a coalition, he would expect the party to hold as many ministerial posts as now — even if the party has far fewer MPs. ‘I’m not going to give away any ministerial seats without a massive fight,’ he said. While he said the party deserves ‘eight out of 10’ for the way it handled the coalition negotiations in 2010, he suggested that Mr Clegg should have been more robust with the Tories in government. ‘You’re not going to bring the government down on something like the NHS reforms if you say no, it’s not happening,’ he said. Mr Farron gave the party a score of just ‘two out of 10’ for how it had handled its time in coalition. And he said Mr Clegg should have understood the damage the party’s U-turn on tuition fees would inflict. But he insisted the party was right to go into coalition at a time of national economic emergency in 2010 and says it would be regrettable if the party was now ‘punished for it’. He said the UK Independence party, the Greens and the Scottish National party might draw the conclusion that voters did not reward parties that ‘behaved like a grown up’. He adds: ‘If that is the message that’s communicated — that parties that behave in a decent way get hammered for it — that is a great worry.’","Tim Farron said Lib Dems should have blocked the Tories' health reforms .

"The former first lady of the Ivory Coast was today jailed for 20 years for 'undermining state security' during post-election violence in 2010-2011 that left nearly 3,000 dead. Simone Gbagbo, the wife of former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo was also accused of 'organising armed gangs' after her husband rejected results of the 2010 presidential elections. The court 'unanimously' condemned her to 20 years in jail, court president Tahirou Dembele said. Ivory Coast's former first lady Simone Gbagbo arrives at the Court of Justice in Abidjan last month during her trial for 'attempting to undermine the security of the state' in events leading to 2010-2011 electoral bloodshed . Gbagbo's face hardened as the verdict was read. She was 'a little affected' by the sentence, her lawyer Me Rodrigue Dadje told AFP. 'I am ashamed of Ivorian justice,' he said, adding that they would appeal the sentence. 'We showed that impunity in Ivory Coast must not continue,' said state prosecutor Soungalo Coulibaly. Laurent Gbagbo's son Michel, a French-born dual national from a previous marriage, was also sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the violence. Once referred to by admirers and opponents alike as Ivory Coast's 'Iron Lady,' Simone Gbagbo has been on trial since January with 82 co-defendants accused of varying degrees of involvement in the deadly unrest. A key issue in her trial was whether she played a part in directing the death squads that ran amok in the weeks after the disputed vote. Prosecutors had asked for a lighter 10-year jail term for the 65-year-old Gbagbo. 'Simone Gbagbo most certainly participated in the composition of armed gangs,' state prosecutor Simon Yabo Odi told the court, adding 'her men... participated in an insurrectional movement.' Relatives of victims of the 2010-2011 post-electoral violence in Ivory Coast protest last month in front of the Palace of Justice in Abidjan as they call for the  sentencing of the former first lady Simone Gbagbo . The previous day, the former first lady gave testimony for nearly four hours, confronting witnesses who said they'd seen her distributing arms to youths in Abidjan with flat denials. She told the court that she 'forgives' her accusers, saying: 'I have suffered humiliation on humiliation during this trial. 'But I am ready to forgive... because if we do not forgive, the country faces a crisis worse than what we experienced.' She also said she did not 'know exactly what the concrete actions are that I am being accused of', and insisted her husband had legitimately won the 2010 election. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in months of post-election violence, which was halted by the intervention of international forces acting under a UN mandate and led by former colonial power France. The son of Ivory Coast's former President Laurent Gbagbo, Michel Gbagbo (right), and former Ivorian Foreign Minister Alcide Djedje (left) arrive at the Court of Justice in Abidjan, on March 9 . The defeated regime allegedly used brutal militias to attack supporters of the declared winner of the poll, Ouattara, but some of his backers are equally accused of atrocities in violence that killed thousands. The Gbagbo couple were arrested in April 2011. The former first lady was taken into custody in the north of the west African country, where she testified she was 'beaten with incredible violence'. The former president himself is in The Hague awaiting trial in July for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. Affi N'Guessan, the former head of the first couple's political party, was sentenced to 18 months in jail for his role in the unrest, covered by the two years he has already served in detention.

"A five-year-old girl was reported to have been sexually assaulted by children her own age at a remote community. Detective Superintendent Brent Warren told the ABC that two boys, aged five and six, allegedly led the indecent assault which was reported by a parent at Alice Springs last month. However he said officers were focusing more on the children's home environment to determine what could have led to the behaviour, confirming that the young girl was not taken to hospital. Stock image: Detective Superintendent Brent Warren said officers were focusing more on the children's home environment to determine what could have led to the behaviour . 'Once we investigated and started asking questions about what happened and talking to the young people involved, it became clear that yes there was some sexualised talking and some sexualised behaviour,' Superintendent Warren told the ABC. '[It was] the kind of incident that we have to refer onto other people to provide a more therapeutic involvement.' It comes just a few days after the Northern Territory's chief minister accused the media of ignoring the alleged rape of a seven-year-old Aboriginal girl in the Northern Territory and implied the reporting was racist. The incident was reported  on March 8 by the ABC which reported that an Aboriginal girl at a town camp outside of Alice Springs had been raped. It comes after  NT chief minister Adam Giles (pictured) accused the media of not reporting on the rape of an Aboriginal minor because the child was not 'a blonde-haired, blue eyed little girl' In a two-sentence media release the following day, NT Police media wrote: 'Alice Springs Police have arrested and charged a 29-year-old man following the sexual assault of a minor.' 'He was refused bail overnight, to appear in Alice Springs Magistrates Court today (Tuesday).' No further information was released. However, during parliament on Tuesday the chief minister Adam Giles accused the media of not reporting the story because the child was not 'a blonde-haired, blue eyed little girl.' 'The saddest part is it was a little blip on the media radar. It raised a few column inches and it disappeared,' he said. Opposition Leader Delia Lawrie (pictured) was quick to defend reporters, labelling Mr Giles accusations as 'heinous' and pointing out that minimal information was available about the case . Stock image: The seven-year-old girl was raped by a 29-year-old near Alice Springs. Giles said: 'A little Aboriginal kid in the Hidden Valley town camp ... it's just not been noticed and I think it's quite disgusting' 'One can only think that if it was a blonde-haired blue-eyed little girl it would have made the front page of media around the country. 'But a little Aboriginal kid in the Hidden Valley town camp ... it's just not been noticed and I think it's quite disgusting.' Acting Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw stood by the timing of the sparse media release . Opposition Leader Delia Lawrie was quick to defend reporters, labelling Mr Giles accusations as 'heinous' and pointing out that minimal information was available about the case. 'Don't blame people who weren't provided information from the very government that is now seeking to blame them,' she said. 'I wouldn't be surprised if there's a lot of pressure on police in terms of what goes out in the media domain, that fits with the culture of cover-up in the (Country Liberal Party).' Police Minister Peter Chandler denied the government was leaning on police not to release information on crime if it was politically uncomfortable. 'Absolutely not,' he said. 'If anybody thinks things are being held back or hidden, that's good for nobody.' Acting Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw stood by the timing of the sparse media release. He said police took great care in making sure that when action was taken it was correct and would not prejudice any case before the courts. He would not comment on the chief minister using such a sensitive issue as a 'political football'. Earlier Mr Giles announced the alleged rape had sparked crisis talks on town camps. All government agencies involved in delivering services and law enforcement at town camps across Alice Springs and Tennant Creek will meet at a closed forum on Friday to discuss safety and living conditions and the performance of government and private organisations providing services.

"A man turned up at a police station to confess the murder of his pregnant girlfriend - carrying the victim's head in a carrier bag, it was reported today. Brazilian Jose Ramos dos Santos, 23, said he strangled then decapitated 16-year-old Shirley Souza after she admitted she had cheated on him. But two days after the crime he claimed he felt 'regret' for what he had done and decided to own up to the gruesome killing. Gruesome: Jose Ramos dos Santos, 23, admitted to murdering and decapitating his 16-year-old girlfriend . Murder: Shirley Souza, 16, was pregnant when her boyfriend, right, strangled her to death after she admitted that she had cheated on him . Santos reportedly carried the plastic bag containing the girl's head with him as he took two buses on a two-hour journey to the police station in the centre of Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil. Police officers were reportedly 'aghast' after being handed the severed head after Santos made his murder confession on Saturday night. Santos told police his girlfriend of one year had visited him on Thursday night at the house he shares with his brother. After having sex for more than two hours, he said the couple began arguing over whether each had ever been unfaithful, and Ms Souza confessed to cheating on him with a mutual friend. Santos claimed he strangled Ms Souza in a fit of rage, then went to have a shower, and after he returned realised that she had died. Santos said he sawed off Miss Souza's with a bread knife before hiding her body in a storage cupboard, but dumped her body after a day when his brother began complaining of a bad odour in the house . Santos turned up at a local police station and admitted the crime two days later, and as officers started taking his statement he produced a carrier bag, containing her severed head . He said he sawed off her head with a bread knife before hiding her body in a storage cupboard, but after a day when his brother began complaining of a bad odour in the house he dumped the rest of her body in an alleyway near his home. The body was found by local residents the next day and police were called, and Santos decided to confess to the crime, arriving at the police station at 7pm that evening. A police spokesman said Santos claimed he 'started to feel a growing sense of regret over the course of the day, so decided to hand himself over the police. 'Officers started taking his statement, which is when he produced a carrier bag, containing the evidence. They were aghast, they hadn't expected that.'","Jose Ramos dos Santos, 23, decapitated his 16-year-old girlfriend .

"A husband and wife undertakers scammed elderly victims out of almost £23,000 after convincing them to sign up for pre-paid funeral schemes. Gary Trevett, 54, and Fiona Langdown, 53, preyed on nine victims after agreeing to make funeral arrangements, then betraying their trust. Their con made customers believe they had paid for a complete service which would take care of their funerals - but the cash was then used to save the couple's failing business. Gary Trevett and Fiona Langdown (pictured outside the funeral directors) conned victims out of almost £23,000 . The pair sold pre-paid plans on the basis that the customer's payment believed to be placed securely into one of two trust funds. But Southampton Crown Court heard that between October 2009 and March 2012, money was siphoned off to save the couple's failing business. The con was only uncovered when former employee Linda Connolly started looking through the accounts at Langdown and Trevett Independent Funeral Directors in Woolston, Southampton, after taking over the failing business in July 2012. The full extent of their con was revealed after Langdown, of Southampton, was found guilty of defrauding four victims and handling the stolen cash of another three. Trevett (right) admitted defrauding all nine victims, but a jury at Southampton Crown Court found Langdown (left) guilty of defrauding four victims and handling the stolen cash of another three . She provided literature to some of the customers and helped Trevett to retain some of the money, by receiving it into their bank account and concealing the fact that it was never paid into the trust fund. But it was Trevett who would befriend customers and spend hours helping them to plan funeral details. Victims described him as a 'charmer' who they felt they could trust and said they were left feeling gullible and angry. Trevett, also from Southampton, had already admitted defrauding all nine people - including a friend, who was deteriorating quickly with dementia. Investigations revealed that when customers were handing over money to pay into secure funeral trusts, it was instead being pocketed by the business. The court was told how Langdown and Trevett became equal partners in the business, based in Southampton, in April 2005. Frank and Shirley Decicco (pictured) were conned by funeral directors Langdown and Trevett . Langdown put in the money with her then-husband while Trevett brought in his experience as an undertaker but she divorced and went on to marry Trevett in 2012. One of the pair's victims, Kathleen Crook, 74, from Netley Abbey, Hampshire, paid the pair £2,485 to make sure her husband John had the funeral he deserves, should the worst happen. But instead she has been left penniless and on antidepressants due to Trevett's betrayal. When she started questioning the plan Trevett reassured her, even kissing her on the cheek, but soon the devastating truth was revealed - all the money was gone. She said: 'I am a bit gullible. But I am an old lady and I just didn't think anyone could do something like this. He seemed such a nice little man. I really trusted him.' She added: 'I am absolutely devastated and feel so betrayed. All that I had is gone. 'It is such a wicked thing to do. For me justice will never be done because I won't get my money back.' Langdown told the court that she had no knowledge of her husband conning people, but jurors did not believe her. She was cleared of charges relating to two victims. Detective Sergeant Ricky Dhanda, from Hampshire Constabulary, has been determined to get justice for the victims. He said: 'Trevett and Langdown preyed on their victims when they were at their most vulnerable. 'They betrayed the trust of the elderly who had so carefully saved and planned for when they were no longer here, to spare their own loved ones the heartache. 'The manner in which their trust was manipulated for financial gain is a sickening thought.' Langdown and Trevett will be sentenced next month.","Gary Trevett, 54, and Fiona Langdown, 53, preyed on nine elderly victims .

"A woman who tried to dine out alone on Valentine's Day is suing a restaurant claiming they refused to serve her when she showed up for her reservation. Kathleen Hampton of Portland, Oregon says she was 'distraught' when after a day spent with her husband, she decided to go to dinner alone when he told her he was too full from their lunch date. But when she showed up at Enzo’s Caffe Italiano, she claims that from the moment she arrived the entire staff did everything in their power to get her to leave the establishment. Now, she is suing them for $100,000 and demanding an apology. Scroll down for video . Kathleen Hampton (above) of Portland, Oregon claims she was refused service and asked to leave Enzo’s Caffe Italiano on Valentine's Day . Hampton showed up for her dinner reservation without her husband and claims the staff waited to seat her and eventually asked her to leave . 'I had a strange feeling when I got there but I didn’t think anything about it until the next set of incidences happen,' said Hampton in court documents obtained by KOIN. Hampton said she arrived for her reservation and said she was alone, and was told there would be a wait. Shortly after, she claims, the staff began seating people who had arrived after her to the restaurant. Then, when she finally was seated at her table, things got even worse for the single diner. 'I finally said I was ready to order, she told me that she was not taking my order and I had to leave and give up my table,' Hampton alleges in her lawsuit. She also claims that she does not believe it was solely the fact that she was single that caused this shocking service . 'I didn’t fit their decor in there,' she said. 'I was the only African American.' And so, she ended up leaving the establishment. 'I cried, I’ve never been so embarrassed and humiliated in my life,' she said. Owner Enzo Lanzadoro (above) claims he would never refuse service to a customer, and that they simply asked to move her to the bar . The owner of Enzo's, Enzo Lanzadoro, disputes these statements however, and tells a far different story. He shoots down the claims of racial discrimination and says that they simply asked Hampton to move to the bar and give up the table as it was such a busy night and they needed the space for another couple after her husband failed to show. 'The waiter came over, I’m so sorry, it’s a busy night, we need to move you to the bar because we need the other chair,' Lanzadoro said. 'It’s Valentine’s night.' Hampton says this never happened, and that she was so excited to eat at Enzo's that she would have gladly taken a seat at the bar. Lanzadoro said she is free to stop by the restaurant any time to try and work things out, and that he would never refuse service to a customer.","Kathleen Hampton of Portland, Oregon claims she was refused service and asked to leave Enzo’s Caffe Italiano on Valentine's Day .

"A further four girls who attend the same east London school as three teenagers who travelled to Syria to join ISIS are being monitored by detectives over fears they may seek to do the same. Including the trio who succeeded in leaving Britain last month, it is thought a total of seven girls at Bethnal Green Academy were considered vulnerable to being radicalised as early as December when a fellow female pupil went to join the jihadis. After the 15-year-old managed to board a flight to Turkey the other girls were placed on a government warning list with the aim of preventing them from taking the same path. Left to right: Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-olds Shamima Begum and Amira Abase. Their families fear police action may have pushed them towards leaving for Syria . Bethnal Green Academy, where four girls thought vulnerable to radicalisation are still being monitored . Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and 16-year-old Kadiza Sultana are all thought to now be Syria after last month flying to Turkey and travelling on by bus. The family of Ms Sultana has voiced concerns that letters from counter-terrorism detectives given to the girls but meant for their parents may have prompted them to leave. The letters, in which detectives sought permission to take statements from the trio in relation to the disappearance of their classmate in December, never reached the girls' parents as they were not passed on. The letters are thought to have been sent shortly before the teenagers themselves left for Syria on February 17. Fahmida Aziz, a cousin of Ms Sultana, told Vice News: 'Were they feeling victimised by police? Were they feeling criminalised? 'Did they feel they had done something wrong? My query would be, by giving this letter, how did that make the girls feel?' Dated February 2, the letters made clear the teenagers were 'not under any suspicion of doing something wrong'. Left to right: Ms Sultana, Ms Begum and Ms Abase at Gatwick Airport before boarding a flight for Turkey . CCTV shows the three schoolgirls (circled) at a bus station in Turkey during their journey to join ISIS . The three teenagers are believed to have travelled over ground from Istanbul to Gaizantep, before crossing the border into Syria near the Kilis crossing . Family members claim that as well as not receiving the letters, the girls' parents were not informed they had been spoken to twice in school by officers. Jubeyda Rauf, the 16-year-old sister of Ms Sultana, said she felt like police 'just let them walk out'. There was no evidence the girls were thinking of fleeing to Syria prior to their departure, Scotland Yard said in a statement, adding that their disappearance had 'come as a great surprise, not least to their own families'. The remaining four girls who are under scrutiny also received the letters and are continuing to attend Bethnal Green Academy, which has been told by police there is no evidence radicalisation took place within its walls. It is understood that detectives have examined mobile phones belonging to the quartet to look at their contacts with the three other teenagers prior to February 17. One line of inquiry is believed to be the theory that the girls who travelled to Syria were directly assisted by an ISIS facilitator based in Britain.","Seven girls at Bethnal Green Academy considered open to radicalisation .

"Sadistic ISIS fanatics are turning children into an army of hundreds of murderous monsters willing to blow themselves up, die in battle and execute hostages for their twisted cause. Extremism experts warn children are being indoctrinated and radicalised from birth, leading to a 'whole generation who will know nothing other than ISIS ideology'. Their comments follow the release of a sickening new video that purports to show a boy of about 10 years old shooting dead of a 19-year-old Israeli-Arab who was taken hostage by the terror group. Scroll down for video . Training: Video footage released by the terrorist organisation shows children carrying guns during a training session . Armed: The children learn to fire AK-47s under the guidance of Islamic State militants in an unnamed training school . Young jihadi: It seems there is no age limit to attend an Islamic State school where children are 'brainwashed' Footage purports to show the child raise his gun and aim it at Muhammad Said Ismail Musallam's forehead before shooting him at point blank range . Vile: A new video appears to show a boy of about 10 years old shoot an Islamic State hostage in the head . The footage appears to show the child, now believed to be a French citizen, raise his gun and aim it at  Muhammad Said Ismail Musallam's forehead before shooting him at point blank range. The hostage seems to be shot a further three times on the ground before the boy lifts his gun to the sky in celebration, shouting  'Allahu Akbar!' and appearing to fire one final shot. The footage of a child seemingly carrying out such a brutal execution has sent shock waves around the world, but it came as no surprise to experts who have been following the brainwashing of youngsters by ISIS. Charlie Winter, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank, said: ‘It is something that has been going on for a long time now. 'It’s deeply, deeply worrying because these children are growing up without any outside influence. ‘They are kids that are being indoctrinated and radicalised from birth.' He added: ‘This is going to be a long-term problem – there is going to be a whole generation of kids in Northern Iraq and Eastern Syria who will know nothing other than Islamic State ideology. ‘I don’t think there is a choice in it for the children – they are the biggest victims in all of this.’ ‘I don’t think there is a choice in it for the children – they are the biggest victims in all of this,' said an expert . Indoctrinated: These children are learning to become Islamic State militants at a school run by the terror group . Combat training: Videos released by the group reveal the tough military training children are forced to undergo and the warped curriculum they learn in terrorist-run schools . Two boys wrestle on the floor at an Islamic State training school, where they are also taught to fire AK-47s . ISIS video claiming to show a young boy executing two Russian spies - Mamayev Jambulat Yesenajovich and Ashimov Sergey Nikolayavich . But how does ISIS turn these innocent children into bloodthirsty killers, and how is it able to so effectively? Videos released by the group reveal the tough military training children are forced to undergo and the warped curriculum they learn in terrorist-run schools. Last month, ISIS released a slickly-edited propaganda video showing boys as young as five being indoctrinated at a military-style training camp for 'cubs' in Syria. Children are said to be taught how to use weapons and even show how to behead using dolls. 'They teach them how to use AK-47s,' an Iraqi security official told NBC News. 'They use dolls to teach them how to behead people, then they make them watch a beheading, and sometimes they force them to carry the heads in order to cast the fear away from their hearts.' Other footage shows children being taught in an ISIS school before learning hand-to-hand combat and how to fire a gun. Pictures posted on ISIS-linked social media accounts have included babies posing with firearms and young children holding up the heads of beheading victims. Some propaganda videos attempt to show the 'lighter' side of life under the control of the caliphate, and unsophisticated ploys such as giving sweets to children seem to have played a part in the radicalisation. ISIS-branded clothing has been made for children and even newborn babies. In a nine-minute video, children in camouflage are seen being trained at the Farouk Institute for Cubs, in the Raqqa province in Syria . 'Teacher': In footage released by ISIS, this man teaches a group of children to write Arabic in a classroom . Unsophisticated ploys such as giving sweets to children seem to have played a part in the radicalisation . Islamic State hands out sweets to children in Benghazi, Libya - another ploy to attract even younger recruits . Human Rights Watch, an organisation which defends the rights of people worldwide, interviewed four former  ISIS child and adult fighters, as well as civilians in the terrorist-controlled areas in Syria. It found the militants have actively recruited children to send to military training camps and have used them in operations including suicide bombings. Barbaric: A child holds a severed head in a photograph too gruesome to show . The children, including Bassim, 17, who joined at just 16 after attending ISIS sermons, said they were recruited through public forums. Raed, 17, went to a training camp when he was just 16, after ISIS visited his hometown in Syria. 'I liked what they are wearing, they were like one herd,' he said. 'They had a lot of weapons. So I spoke to them, and decided to go their training camp in Kafr Hamra in Aleppo.' These children and the adults interviewed said there were youngsters aged 13 or younger undergoing the same training and performing the same military duties as adults. Amr, 17, told Human Rights Watch that when he joined the jihadi movement full-time, he was given weapons and equipment, as well as a salary. He even signed up for suicide missions because he felt social pressure to do so, although he was towards the end of the list, several hundred names down. One doctor said he treated a boy aged between 10 and 12 years old whose job it was to whip ISIS prisoners. In November last year, a United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria report found that massacres, the beheading of boys as young as 15, and amputations and lashings in public squares with residents - including children - forced to watch were on the list of crimes. Propaganda: An Islamic State fighter carrying a flag poses with two young children in Benghazi, Libya . Young jihadi: Abu Bakr al-Faransi is believed to be the youngest French child to die fighting for ISIS in Syria . This disgusting Islamic State photograph shows a man forcing a tiny baby to kick a severed head . The research, based on interviews and documents, photographs and video footage released by the group itself, showed there was widespread use of child soldiers, and forcing women to bear children to the fighters. It also discovered children are subjected to violence and are systematically recruited as soldiers - forced to witness and carry out atrocities. The report found ISIS was  trying to indoctrinate minority children and turn them against their families. Speaking to MailOnline, Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said he wouldn't be surprised if  hundreds of children had been recruited. ‘This is about the brainwashing and sexual grooming of our young children,' he said. 'It's very different from what happens when 18+ year olds become radicalised and are recruited into becoming jihadists. They are grown-ups and responsible for what they do. ‘They have been preyed upon by sadistic fanatics.' Speaking to MailOnline, Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said children have been 'preyed upon by sadistic fanatics' An ISIS interviewer asks one child, who is standing alongside an armed companion, what his life is like under the Islamic State caliphate at a fairground north of Mosul in Iraq . He added: 'The prime responsibility for this lies with the radicalisers and recruiters and the internet service providers who provide the links that they follow with such dedication that they turn their backs on their loved ones and the good things that all children should have, whatever their faith or ethnic background. ‘Instead, they have been delivered to those who peddle exploitation and death. We here now have some very tough questions to address. ‘Our laws make it plain that we owe a very clear duty of care to the children. They are kids.’ Just yesterday, it was reported a 13-year-old from France had died fighting for Islamic State in Syria. It's been reported that Abu Bakr al-Faransi, originally from Strasbourg, was killed when Government forces attacked a border post he was guarding. It is believed to be the youngest to die fighting for Islamic State in Syria. And last month, it was revealed ISIS had released a guidebook to help young mothers raise a 'Mujahid child'. 'Don't wait until they are seven to start, for it may be too late by then,' it says. Human Rights Watch has called on ISIS to stop deliberately recruiting children, in particular through weapons training and other military training in school environments.

"An extremist  preacher who defended the Charlie Hebdo massacre just hours after the attacks were carried out has branded taxpayer-funded deradicalisation schemes a 'scam'. Mizanur Rahman, 32, was sent on a programme aimed at turning him away from extreme views after he was released from prison three years into a six-year sentence for soliciting murder. The cleric was jailed in 2007 after calling for soldiers to be brought back from Iraq in body bags but claims he then spent most his time in the Government's deradicalisation programme playing pool. Mizanur Rahman was jailed for six years in 2007 after calling for British soldiers to be killed in Iraq . He told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'Basically I would go there and play pool. There were a couple of people there who were in prison with me. We used to catch up and play pool, then go home. 'Sometimes I wouldn't even do that. I would just show my face then go home. I think I probably had a conversation once or twice in the whole period. 'It's just a scam - the whole thing is a money-making scheme. They are making a lot of money from the Government and actually doing nothing with it.' The outspoken preacher has been responsible for a string of extremist and inflammatory statements. During his trial at the Old Bailey, a film was shown in which he told a crowd of 300 protesters: 'We want to see them coming home in body bags. We want to see their blood running in the streets of Baghdad.' He added: 'We want to see the Mujahideen shoot down their planes the way we shoot down birds, we want to see their tanks burn in the way we burn their flags.' Rahman also had placards calling for the annihilation and beheading of those who insulted Islam. Just recently he backed the Paris massacres hours after the bloody events unfolded and told his followers 'Britain is the enemy of Islam'. He defended the brutal murder of 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo offices, saying: 'Insulting Islam... they can’t expect a different result.' Set up in 2005 in the wake of the London bombings, the Government's Prevent strategy attempts to 'deradicalise' or soften extremist views. However, it has been widely condemned as failing, and with an approximate budget of £40million per year, an extremely expensive one. Under the programme, the Government works with mosques and religious groups to reinforce anti-jihad messages, while social workers, psychologists and medical experts counsel radicals. However, the programme has been widely condemned. Among the issues plaguing the initiative is the impossibility to assess its effectiveness as well as its potential to create an 'us and them' mindset in the communities it targets, and stigmatise Muslims. Experts warned the sermon, which backed the jihadists who killed 17 people over three days in the French capital, could incite further killings. The Government's Prevent strategy, which aims to tackle radicalisation, has come under the spotlight after hundreds of Britons travelled to Syria to fight alongside Islamic State. The Home Office said the initiative was 'fundamentally revised' in 2011. A spokeswoman said: 'As a country, we must consistently challenge the twisted narrative of extremism that has seduced some of our vulnerable young people. 'We have trained more than 130,000 people working on the front line of our public sector to help identify and prevent extremism, excluded more preachers of hate than any other government and successfully taken down more than 75,000 pieces of terrorist-related material from the internet.' The Home Office also highlighted measures in new anti-terror legislation. 'The new Counter-terrorism and Security Act will make Channel, the voluntary programme for people at risk of radicalisation, a legal requirement for public bodies ensuring it is delivered consistently across the country,' the spokeswoman said. 'The Act also creates a new duty to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism. Specified authorities such as police, prisons, local authorities, schools and universities will be required to have due regard to the Prevent duty.'","British hate preacher Mizanur Rahman brands the Prevent strategy a 'scam'

"It's probably not the sort of substance you'd expect bikies to use to smuggle steroids into the country but the body-building drugs market is now considered so lucrative, estimated at a billion dollars in some quarters, that outlaw motorcycle gangs are using 'gay lube oil' to try and hide the ill-gotten gear. Australians spend up to $10 billion on fitness each year and a large chunk of that money now goes on illegal substances - and criminal syndicates have muscled in on the illegal part of the fitness industry, using extraordinary methods to try and avoid detection. Steroid oil in sex lube vials, powders inside green tea packets and ephedrine packed in facial creams, are just some of the methods being used to avoid being caught. With criminal syndicates having had their supply of amphetamines and cocaine severely affected by a record number of busts, they have increasingly focused on the body-building market and are being supplied by underworld gangs in south-east Asia and the Americas. The steroid market is now considered so lucrative, outlaw bikie gangs have muscled in on the illegal industry and they're using extraordinary methods to try and avoid detection, including place the substances inside sex aid packaging like these, labelled 'gay lube oil' Australian Police say bikie gangs have now shifted focus heavily into the steroid market as authorities crack down on cocaine and amphetamine crime syndicates . Some estimate the illegal market in steroids across Australia could be worth up to a billion dollars with Australians spending almost $10 billion on fitness each year . Over the past decade, the number of performance and image enhancing drugs detected at the Australian border has increased 7-fold, with South Australia recording the biggest percentage increase. Motorcycle gangs are trying to avoid detection by putting steroid oil inside products labelled 'sexual lubrication' 'They are getting amongst it more and more, it's a different market for them and we are regularly staging operations targeting them and steroids,' revealed Detective Superintendent Mick Niland, the head of Queensland's Taskforce Maxima. 'They try many different ways to avoid detection, that's for sure.' And that's because there is an increasing demand for the illegal performance enhancing substances, one which continues to grow every year. At one Gold Coast health clinic alone, there have been up to 150 steroid injections reported in one month. Queensland and New South Wales are considered the hot-beds in steroid production and trade with South Australia, reporting the biggest (percentage) increase in the number of seizures in a year, registering just 1 in 2012 and then 30 in 2013. 'Half of our seizures in the past few months have been about steroids,' Dept Supt Niland added. 'They are always trying different ways to avoid detection,' said Mick Niland of Tasforce Maxima as his group battles against the increasing trade in steroids by bikie gangs and the methods used to avoid detection . The Bandidos and Lone Wolf bikie gangs have been targeted in raids by authorities trying to break their hold on the new business of steroids distribution . Queensland police busted a Wavell Heights operation in January, arresting a husband and wife over this haul . Steroid seizures and arrests are climbing every year, they are now at record levels and show no sign of declining, with the trade controlled by the motorcycle gangs, who are increasingly using the back of stores and city garages, instead of gyms and their traditional club-houses, to sell the illicit products. It's not just the 20-something gym junkies they're selling to, recent surveys have revealed that up to 3 per cent of 12 to 17-year-old school students have admitted to using  steroids to bulk up. Taskforce Maxima commenced in October of 2013 and 'initially we did find just small quantities of steroids within the gangs'. 'Since then it has grown, both the local production and trafficking of steroids.' In the past six months alone, Customs has intercepted more than 3000 packages of steroids, from all parts of the globe. Outlaw motorcycle gangs have muscled in on the illegal part of the fitness industry, using extraordinary methods to try and avoid detection of steroid shipments . Customs officials are finding steroids secreted in a variety of manners, including pills and powder inside herbal products and even green tea packaging. They are even importing ephedrine in women's facial creams . Tasforce Maxima, along with officials from the AFP and Customs, raided 10 properties across parts of Queensland, arresting 7 people and locating 200 vials of Human Growth Hormone . Half of our seizures in the past few months have been about steroids,' Detective Superintendent Mick Niland has revealed. He is the head of Queensland's Taskforce Maxima, which investigates the dealings of outlaw bikies gangs . In the past six months alone, Customs has intercepted more than 3000 packages of steroids, from all parts of the globe. During one raid, police answered a knock at the door - it was a courier delivering another package of steroids sent from the US to the same address . One dose of Human Growth Hormone (HGH) can cost about $500, a vial of testosterone for more than $200 but there are other substances which can be bought on the black market for as little as $50 for a 10-week course. Most users find it easier and safer to pay more locally, rather than order the drugs themselves, from overseas. 'They are brought in from all over,' Det Supt Niland said. 'Europe, the US and mostly south-east Asia, quite a lot from Thailand and also China. 'We've set up a close alliance with Customs and other strategic partners, including the AFP and other national anti-gangs units and conducted a number of investigations, and in particular we've seen the trafficking and production linked to the Lone Wolf and Bandidos gangs.' A caes full of PIEDs. Officers seized large quantities of illegal performance and image-enhancing drugs after searching a property in Adelaide's south . Customs uncovered this haul of steroids during an operation at Gold Coast Airport. Bikies are trying to disguise their illicit substances inside sex aid bottles, facial creams and herbal teas . He revealed that the Taskforce most recently busted a major syndicate involving bikies, personal trainers and supplement stores, in 10 raids across Queensland. Over the past decade, the number of performance and image enhancing drugs detected at the Australian border has increased 7-fold, with the 10,356 detections in the year 2012–13. That was a record number, which was exceeded last year and will be again this time around when figures are collated by the Australian Crime Commission in three months. The use of performance and image-enhancing drugs (PIEDs), is now so bad that many gyms have been forced to put syringe disposal bins in place, to ensure the safety of other gym members. The problem for local authorities, is that the local bikie gangs have linked with criminal syndicates overseas. 'It is all  linked to criminal partners off-shore and one major issue, of course, is the accessibility via the internet,' he said. Det Supt Niland revealed that during a recent raid in Brisbane, detectives even took delivery from a courier. 'They were conducting a search when the courier arrived and delivered a package which had been sent form the United States to the same address, where they were making arrests. 'There were 300 ampoules full of injectable steroids inside the package.' Over the past six months, the Queensland Taskforce has made 73 arrests for possession, production and trafficking in steroids .. after raids in more than 50 properties. 'It's very much Gold Coast and Brisbane based where the majority of steroids are being located, but steroids have been located over the length and breadth of Queensland,' he added. Part of the bust at Gold Coast Airport which netted 29,000 steroid tablets . Customs and Border Protection officers in WA found these body-building drugs and weapons inside a case at Perth Airport . 'This is a trans-national crime, there are no borders for the bikies at the present time, there's movement across not just the state, but also national and international borders. 'The trafficking which is occurring ranges from the low level personal use to imported raw steroid powders which are then produced into injectable varieties, from south-east Asia primarily. 'It was once a boutique market, which is growing rapidly and they are not just selling, they are using as well and we are very well aware of the effects it has when they are using.' The Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission reports that: 'There has been an increase in the use of Performance and Image Enhancing Drugs (PIED) by younger people, particularly male adolescents, motivated by body image rather than performance.' 'PIEDs are diverted for misuse and supply through a range of sources, including the internet.' 'The likelihood of the illicit market continuing to expand will be dictated by the demand for the substance and the ability of suppliers (whether they be individuals or organised syndicates) to continue to access and import required quantities. Should this happen, it is likely that there will be an increase in this market.' That market is clearly on the rise, with up to 10 per cent of those using needle exchanges now admitting to injecting steroids - up from 2 per cent just seven years ago.","Bikie gangs have taken control of the illegal substance trade in Australia .
They order cheaper versions of anabolic steroids from south-east Asia off the internet and on-sell to customers .
Drugs are concealed inside everything from sex aids to women's facial creams and even green tea to try and avoid detection at the border .

"North London's bustling borough of Islington just got a whole lot more colourful. On Clerkenwell Road, artists created a 3D art installation that looks as though the side of a building wall has been knocked through to reveal the interiors of a family home. The project, which took over two weeks to paint, is designed to inspire homeowners to be braver with colour. North London's bustling borough of Islington just got a whole lot more colourful thanks to this art installation . Artists have crafted a 3D art project that looks as though the side of a building has been knocked through . The illusory display is a type of artwork known as trompe d'oeil and exposes what looks like a two bedroom household above the revamped Hat & Feathers public house. Anything but a small artistic feat, the entire process took over 160 hours to cover the 1,352 square foot wall, and was created in honour of the UK and Ireland launch of Valspar paint. The thousands of passers-by who frequent the busy street corner each day had to do a double take. The lifelike interiors were brought to life by Poole-based community artist, Nina Camplin, who specialises in large-scale 'trick of the eye' paintings. The project is located on a busy corner on Clerkenwell Road, and attracts the attention of many passers-by . The illusory artwork, painted in trompe d'oeil style, depicts the interiors of a two bedroom family home . The project, which took over two weeks to paint, is designed to inspire homeowners to be braver with colour . In this instance, she used to her skills to create the 3D scene on an otherwise flat surface. The campaign is intended to encourage UK homeowners to inject a bit of colour into their own living spaces. Research shows that, currently, 78 per cent of UK homeowners opt to paint their homes in cream, white or neutral, while a mere 6 per cent of the nation embraces any sort of vivid hues in their interiors. Jane Ryder of Valspar Europe said: 'The reaction from the public so far has been amazing. 'So many people have stopped to take photographs and ask the artists about the project - it's starting to feel like London's latest tourist attraction!' Valspar Paint is available exclusively at B&Q.","Community artist, Nina Camplin, specialises in large-scale illusory artwork .

"Bubbly: But Mathilda soon developed narcolepsy, suffering from terrifying nocturnal hallucinations and excruciating pain . When Claire Crisp agreed to have her three-year-old daughter Mathilda vaccinated against swine flu, she believed she was doing the best to protect her from a life-threatening pandemic. In 2009, all children under five were invited to be vaccinated in a nationwide scheme. Fortunately, the much-feared 2009-2010 outbreak never reached the pandemic scale expected. But Claire is convinced that the vaccine against it has left Mathilda with severe narcolepsy. Mathilda is the youngest known person in the world to be diagnosed with the neurological condition, which causes sufferers to suddenly fall asleep during the day. Mathilda also had terrifying nocturnal hallucinations and excruciating pain.Now she is part of a protracted legal battle against the Government for compensation for vaccine-related narcolepsy. Last week, their case went to court on appeal. This wrangling has continued despite the fact the Government’s scientists admitted two years ago that the vaccine, Pandemrix, could cause narcolepsy, having previously denied any link. In a statistical investigation, published in the British Medical Journal, they found children given the vaccine were 14 times more likely to have developed narcolepsy than unvaccinated children. Claire, 44, a former NHS physiotherapist, thought she was playing safe when she had Mathilda vaccinated. Doctors had suggested her daughter could be at particular risk from respiratory trouble from swine flu because she was born with a minor throat condition, laryngomalacia, which obstructs breathing. Children normally grow out of it by three. ‘We took the swine flu risk seriously since Mathilda had only recently outgrown laryngomalacia,’ says Claire, who also has a son, Elliot, and another daughter, Liberty. NHS clinics administered more than 900,000 doses of Pandemrix in 2009 and 2010. Mathilda’s first troubling symptoms developed within two weeks. Her sleep became disturbed, leaving her exhausted in the day. Then she began to suffer from hallucinations at night, thinking there were demons in her bedroom. ‘The symptoms just got worse — she wasn’t sleeping at night, and sleeping and crying all day,’ says Claire. ‘Nearly every time I turned round in the day, she was asleep. ‘She was slurring her words. She could not walk in a straight line, she suffered excruciating leg pains. She also became incontinent.’ Then she developed cataplexy, where she’d become temporarily paralysed for seconds by emotional triggers such as happiness or surprise, though staying conscious. ‘Her brother would say a joke and she would fall down,’ says Claire. Within six months, Claire and her husband Oliver, a professor of theology, were housebound caring for Mathilda. She was taken to a children’s hospital for what Claire calls ‘a series of failed visits’. Initially, doctors thought she had a brain tumour, but after tests they ruled that out. ‘The doctors quickly wrote us off as an anxious mother and a pain-in-the-a*** child.’ The family was being referred to a psychiatric unit when a locum doctor from India diagnosed narcolepsy, which normally appears at around the age of 15. Doctors had suggested to Claire her daughter could be at risk from respiratory trouble from swine flu because she was born with a minor throat condition . Claire spoke to a friend’s cousin, who has narcolepsy. ‘They warned me that we probably wouldn’t get any help for it in Europe, but said Stanford University in California had the world’s best expertise. I got in touch with them.’ Based on blood samples sent by post, experts at the university confirmed the diagnosis. The acknowledged world expert in the condition, Dr Emmanuel Mignot, is the director of the university’s Centre for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. He is recognised for finding the cause of narcolepsy — the failure of special ‘wakefulness’ cells, called hypocretins, found in the brain’s sleep centre. Dr Mignot has also identified a possible reason why the vaccine has caused narcolepsy: a part of the swine flu virus is similar to a part of the hypocretin cell. The Pandemrix vaccine primes the immune system’s ‘killer’ cells to attack this part of the swine flu virus. But in a minority of patients, the killer cells also mistakenly attack the hypocretin cells, thinking they are swine flu cells. The risk is confined to people with a susceptible genetic make-up, Dr Mignot wrote in the journal Science Translational Medicine in 2013 — with around 20 per cent of the European population having this gene profile. However, he’s had to retract this article because the data could not be reproduced. But Dr Mignot believes another possible link is adjuvants in the vaccine. These chemicals stimulate the immune system to produce a more powerful reaction to the inactive virus in the vaccine. In the U.S., swine flu vaccines have not used adjuvants nor have they been linked with narcolepsy. Dr Mignot says: ‘My opinion is that it was a combination of the adjuvants and the H1N1 [swine flu] virus particles in Pandemrix that made it very nasty for narcolepsy.’ GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the pharmaceutical company which made the vaccine, says 795 people across Europe have reported developing narcolepsy since its use began in 2009. Convinced their daughter needed to be under Dr Mignot’s care — who would provide the expensive drug therapy she needed for free — the family moved to California four years ago. Experts at Stanford University in California confirmed Mathilda's diagnosis . Mathilda began receiving Xyrem, a drug that helps with symptoms of narcolepsy, possibly by affecting chemical messengers in the brain. ‘A course of Xyrem costs £12,000 a year,’ says Claire. ‘Some children in Britain receive it, depending on a postcode lottery. It was not available to us in Bristol.’ The drug treatment has been ‘life-changing,’ she says. Mathilda sleeps restfully at night for three hours at a time. Rarely does she experience hallucinations. Her sleep in the day is condensed to two naps, she no longer collapses when she is happy nor does she slur or wobble when walking. While the Government acknowledges Pandemrix can cause narcolepsy, it has decided the condition doesn’t make people more than 60 per cent disabled, which is the threshold for compensation for any jab under the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme run by the Department for Work and Pensions. The scheme was set up to provide a clear, non-adversarial way of compensating people for damage from mass vaccination campaigns, meaning the government, not the manufacturer, ultimately foots the bill. A spokesman says: ‘Decisions on claims take into account the individual circumstances of each case and the latest available medical evidence. To date, no payment has been made in respect of immunisation against swine flu.’ Claire Crisp says this attitude is born out of ignorance: ‘The condition has destroyed about 70 million neurons within Mathilda’s brain’s sleep centre.’ Over the past four years, the scheme has not paid out anything. However, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says that between 2009 and 2014, it received 191 reports of the Pandemrix vaccine allegedly causing narcolepsy and related conditions. Likewise, no payouts have been made to young girls who have apparently suffered damage from the HPV vaccine campaign against cervical cancer — despite the fact that, according to the MHRA, more than 300 schoolgirls a year are reporting serious side effects. Claire’s lawyers, Hodge Jones & Allen, have 68 people in a narcolepsy class action — two-thirds were children when vaccinated. Lawyer Peter Todd has been pursuing the cases with the Vaccines Damage Payment Scheme. ‘The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) initially refused our application because it would not accept there was a link between Pandemrix and narcolepsy,’ he says. This was before the publication of the BMJ study. ‘Now they are saying narcolepsy is not a severe disability and does not qualify for compensation.’ Mathilda's drug treatment has been 'life-changing' and she sleeps restfully at night for three hours at a time . After a court ruled that the patients could be compensated, a DWP appeal reversed this. Last week Mr Todd took an appeal against this ruling to a higher tribunal. He is also pursuing GSK on the grounds not of negligence, but under consumer protection law that the product wasn’t as safe as consumers could expect. Claire stresses she is not anti-vaccine. ‘The problem is how the Government is dealing with the consequences of Pandemrix.’ This is echoed by Matt O’Neil of the charity Narcolepsy UK. ‘Vaccination campaigns only work if sufficient people volunteer for them,’ he says. ‘Anyone who suffers damage from doing something for the good of society should surely be looked after by society.’ A GSK spokesman told us: ‘While those vaccinated with Pandemrix have been shown in several published studies to be more likely to develop narcolepsy than those who were not, further research is needed to confirm what role the vaccine may have played in the development of narcolepsy among those affected. ‘Pandemrix went through a rigorous approval process . . . throughout the development of our pandemic vaccines there were no data to suggest a potential for an increased risk of narcolepsy among those vaccinated. ‘We continue to support ongoing work from other experts and organisations investigating reported cases of this condition.’ The universal use of Pandemrix in those aged under 20 was stopped in Britain in 2011.

"It is known as El Caminito del Rey (the King's little pathway) and was a popular challenge for adventurers until five people lost their lives while taking on the path between 1999 and 2000. But 14 years after it was closed due to safety fears, the famous walkway - known as the most dangerous in the world - is set to reopen to the public. The narrow gorge in the province of Malaga, El Caminito del Rey is a precarious walkway that rises over 100 metres (328ft) above the river below. The original trail was built to provide construction workers with access to hydroelectric power plants in Chorro Falls and Gaitanejo Falls . The pathway has been reinforced with an extra security fence and  is now entirely safe for the public to use . The trail was built to provide construction workers with access to hydroelectric power plants in Chorro Falls and Gaitanejo Falls between 1901 and 1905. And it earned its royal name after it was crossed by King Alfonso XIII, who went to attend the opening ceremony of the dam Conde del Guadalhorce in 1921. But after five people lost their lives negotiating the pathway between 1999 and 2000, the authorities were forced to close it in 2001. After that the walkway fell into disrepair and people were ordered to stay clear of it with a €6,000 maximum fine for trespassers the deterrent. The pathway was shut in 2001 after five people lost their lives while negotiating it between 1999 and 2000 . The walkers can be seen wearing hardhats as they make their way across the newly renovated trail . However, after an extensive €2.8 million restoration it was recently reopened to the press and will officially open to the public on March 28. A joint effort by the regional government of Andalusia and the local government of Malaga, who shared the costs of the renovation, the project has retained much of the walkway’s original features. The pathway has also been reinforced with an extra security fence and despite offering up some dizzying views is entirely safe. The €2.8 million restoration cost was split between the regional government of Andalusia and the local government of Malaga . King Felipe is said to be among the first guests preparing to negotiaite the rennovated path . In the video walkers can be seen wearing hard hats as they clutch the newly installed handrails on their way along the trail.

"The swarms of insects that plague light bulbs at night could be about to become a thing of the past. Scientists have invented a bulb that emits less blue and green wavelengths, which they claim is 20 per cent less appealing to moths and other bugs. The technology could also save lives in the tropical regions of the world, where insects carry a multitude of potentially fatal diseases. A bright idea: Scientists claim they have invented a bulb that emits less blue and green wavelengths, which doesn’t appeal to insects as much as conventional LED light bulbs (shown) Light emitted by conventional bulbs - particularly the blue wavelengths of LED bulbs – is attractive to a range of insects, drawing them out from the night and straight to people’s homes. The problem with this is that insects such as mosquitoes, sand flies and ‘kissing bugs’ that fly towards the light, increase the risk of catching vector-borne diseases. Six million people worldwide, mostly in Latin America, are infected with Chagas disease, which is transmitted by ‘kissing bugs’ that are attracted to lights. Sand flies infect people with a protozoan parasite responsible for 20,000 deaths annually, while mosquitoes, which are also drawn to the light, carry malaria which kills more than 600,000 people a year. Light emitted by conventional bulbs - particularly the blue wavelengths of LED bulbs – is attractive to a range of insects, drawing them out from the night and straight to people’s homes. Here, a vast number of bugs flock towards a floodlight in Australia . Graphene is set to make its commercial debut in the form of a light bulb in a ‘matter of months’. The bulb contains a filament-shaped LED coated in the super-strong carbon and is set to go on sale late 2015. British researchers behind the bulb claim it will last longer and be cheaper to make than conventional LEDS, as well as slash energy use by 10 per cent. It looks like a traditional light bulb, but the graphene coating enables it to conduct electricity and heat more effectively, to facilitate the improved performance, meaning users won't have to change their bulbs as regularly. It was designed at the University of Manchester, where graphene was discovered, and will be made by Graphene Lighting PLC, a UK-registered company that’s a spin-out from the university. The university said in a statement: ‘It is expected that the graphene light bulbs will be on the shelves in a matter of months, at a competitive cost.’ This implies that the graphene bulbs may cost less than LED bulbs, which can be priced at around £15. While you may imagine that the brightness of a light bulb may dictate how many insects are drawn towards it, scientists from the University of Southern California say it’s the colour of the light that matters most. Travis Longcore, associate professor of spatial sciences at the university, said future LED bulb designs could be customised to be less attractive to specific insect species. All insects are attracted to ‘white’ light, which is a combination of all colours, but different insects are sensitive to particular combinations of these wavelengths. For example, blue, violet, and ultraviolet wavelengths are especially attractive to moths and some other insect groups, so these wavelengths were turned down in experimental light bulb. However, the light it emitted, still appeared white to humans. Professor Longcore led a team, with help from Philips Research in the Netherlands, with the aim of reducing the number of insects an LED bulb can attract while still maintaining white light for indoor use. Dr André Barroso, a senior scientist at Philips, said: ‘For the purpose of this study, we created unique and one-off LED lamp designs that can be customised to emit different colour wavelengths to reduce the attraction of insects. ‘This is where lighting meets health and well-being.’ The bulbs were tested against off-the-shelf commercial LED bulbs, compact fluorescent bulbs and a control with no bulb. Professor Longcore’s research team fixed each bulb over traps in several locations in California – two in the Santa Monica Mountains to represent rural locations and one in the city of Los Angeles. Sand flies infect people with a protozoan parasite responsible for 20,000 deaths annually, while mosquitos, (pictured) which are also drawn to the light, carry malaria which kills more than 600,000 people a year . In just over a month, they collected 5,579 insects in the traps, it was reported in the journal Philosophical Transactions B. The order Diptera, which mosquitoes belong to, represented almost seven in every 10 insects caught. They found that despite the customised bulbs being brighter than the LED bulbs, they attracted 20 per cent fewer insects. He said: ‘The research provides proof in concept that LED lamps can be customised to avoid specific areas of the spectrum that could have adverse environmental consequences, while still providing light for indoor use.’ ‘For places in the world where glass windows and screens are uncommon, reducing insect attraction to indoor lights is a big deal.’ ‘Future research is needed into the light attraction of individual vector species and with the current configurations in the tropics, but the current results indicate a viable path forward.’","Bulb was created by the University of Southern California and Phillips .

"Last week he was the face of Comic Relief, fronting the annual fundraising telethon watched by millions that raised £1billion for good causes. But now the leftwing firebrand Russell Brand has launched an astonishing attack on the very same charity,  claiming he felt 'compromised' by accepting the gig. During his show at London's Proud Archivist on Sunday, Brand, 39, asked: 'Is it right to do Comic Relief? Plus is any f***er watching it?' he said. Scroll down for video . Russell Brand has attacked Comic Relief just two days after he co-hosted the show (pictured) last Friday . Brand, 39, even claimed he felt 'compromised by accepting the job hosting last week's Red Nose Day fundraising telethon which was watched by 8.1 million people and helped Comic Relief breaking the £1 billion barrier . 'Those were the questions I was asking myself as I walked out confidently onto the Palladium stage. And the answer is, 'No, not really'.' He then appeared to launch a scathing attack on British charities, claiming they were 'part of the problem'. The comedian had enraged some viewers on Red Nose day when he joked about sharing syringes. During the charity telethon, Brand said: 'I'm in the unfortunate position of having to ask you to donate money to buy syringes, literally the exact opposite of how I spend most of my time, and the previous two decades of my life,' he said. 'Fighting every instinct of my being. 'Don't make 'em not work again, that's terrible. I'll share. Sharing is caring. Although do watch out for infectious blood diseases.' Met with nervous laughs from the audience he went onto compare the distasteful joke to the controversy involving Jeremy Clarkson;s alleged use of the 'n-word'. The comedian and self-styled revolutionary said: 'Ultimately taking responsibility away from the centralised powers of created government, corporations and alleviating that stress and tensions by placing the burden once more on ordinary people. 'Is charity part of the problem?' Despite his bizarre rant, Brand admitted those behind 'Comic Relief had 'good intentions'. His comments are made even stranger by the fact that vegetarian Brand has been an open supporter of several charities including Amnesty International, David Lynch Foundation, Hillsborough Family Support Group and PETA. He is also the ambassador for The Recovery Group UK, a supportive body for addiction, and has joined protests against austerity cuts. Dr Karl Wilding, director of public policy at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said there had never been a clear answer to where the responsibility lay between state and charities. Just two days after the Comic Relief gig, and asked an audience at his show at London's Proud Archivist (pictured) if charity was 'part of the problem?' The comedian and self-styled revolutionary has been an open supporter of several charities and has joined protests against austerity cuts including Occupy London last October (pictured) 'It's not clear what Mr Brand's proposed solution is. Mr Brand has, in his own particular way, highlighted an age-old philosophical debate about where the boundaries of the state's responsibility should lie, which has never had a clear answer . 'Charities run high-quality, innovative services that are responsive to the needs in different areas. They also create a way for people to help support causes they care about, either through donating or volunteering.' A spokesman for Comic Relief said: 'Russell Brand has been involved in Comic Relief in many brilliant ways over the years and we're enormously grateful. He was a fantastic addition to the night of telly last week, and we're thrilled that he was able to give his time.' Last December, Russell Brand was accused of hypocrisy after he ranted about rising rents in London even though he lives in a £2million bachelor pad owned by a firm based in a tax haven. The millionaire comedian and self-styled revolutionary flew into a rage when it was suggested he was part of the housing problem in trendy Hoxton, east London, where he rents a £5,000-a-month loft. Brand had joined hundreds of residents and supporters of the New Era estate in Hoxton, east London- built as affordable housing for local workers- in a protest over fears that New York-based Westbrook Partners want to hike rents to market levels. Brand had joined hundreds of residents and supporters of the New Era estate in Hoxton, east London- built as affordable housing for local workers- in a protest over fears that New York-based Westbrook Partners want to hike rents to market levels . The star, believed to be worth £9million, was helping deliver a petition on affordable housing to 10 Downing Street to champion the cause. But Brand lost his temper when TV reporter Paraic O'Brien asked him whether the super-rich buying up property in London was driving up prices for everyone else. The incensed star said he is 'part of the solution' and called the reporter a 'snide' for asking how much he pays in rent. Asked about the value of his home, the 39-year-old angrily replied: 'I'm not interested in talking to you about my rent, mate. I'm here to support a very important campaign.' Simon Cowell labelled Brand a 'hypocrite' last year . Accused of being 'part of the problem' of rocketing housing prices, Brand, 39, said: 'I am part of the solution.' He suggested his fame meant he was able to 'amplify the voices of ordinary people'. Asked again about his house, Brand pointed his finger in O'Brien's face and said: 'It's rented. We don't know the value, you would have to talk to my landlord. Blessedly, I can afford my rent and I'm prepared to stand up for people that can't.' Refusing to answer further questions about his own housing costs, Brand terminated the two-minute interview and accused the reporter of trying to wreck his campaign, saying: 'Snides like you, mate, undermine it. You're a snide.' An estate agent who asked not to be named said of Brand's property: 'We had it on at £1,150 per week two or three years ago.' The warehouse conversion last changed hands in March 2007 when it was bought by a property firm in the British Virgin Islands for £1.25million, having sold three years earlier at £730,000. Prices have shot even higher across the capital since. Brand is understood to have sold a previous home, a five-storey house in Hampstead, North West London, for £2.3million in 2010. Westbrook Partners have since sold the development to Dolphin Square Charitable Foundation, an affordable housing group which says it is committed to delivering low cost rents to Londoners on low to middle incomes. Simon Cowell also labelled Brand a 'hypocrite' last year after he accused the comedian of accepting large Hollywood film salaries whilst campaigning against the UK political system. The music mogul told Russell to give up his multi-million pound salary if he was planning to continue his campaigning streak. Russell Brand took part in the protest outside Parliament which was orchestrated by activists who said they intended to cause chaos throughout London . The X Factor boss told Shortlist magazine: 'A revolution? He's getting $10 million a movie. 'I mean come on! Well give your money back then, Russell. I always say that about people. Start off as you mean to go on. 'Donate all the money back to the revolution and then I'll believe it. I'm living in a $10 million mansion and I want a revolution? Give me a break.' The self-styled anti-establishment figure also faced fierce online backlash with social media users labelling him as the 'epitome of a champagne socialist' when it emerged that he left a Bonfire Night protest to take his place alongside a host of celebrities invited to a West End press night . Brand had joined the crowd as thousands of masked anti-capitalist demonstrators descended on Westminster for a protest which saw scuffles with police. But he was later spotted joining celebrities including fellow comedians Jimmy Carr and David Walliams in the West End for the press night of Made In Dagenham at the Adelphi Theatre. One outraged Twitter user wrote: 'Russell Brand loves a revolution but then leaves demonstration early to go to a celeb freebie party'. A number of others pointed out that so-called anti-capitalist Brand had amassed a personal fortune worth millions.'","Comedian Russell Brand has attacked Comic Relief two days after hosting .

"The spokesperson for the Missouri auditor's office has taken his life - just a month after his boss, Tom Schweich, took his own life amid claims he was being politically bullied. Robert 'Spence' Jackson, 44, took a sick day on Friday and shot himself either Friday night or early Saturday, authorities said on Monday. His body was found in his bedroom on Sunday during a well-being check around 7pm after his mother called police when she was unable to reach him. A gun was found near his body. Police spokesman Captain Doug Shoemaker said that investigators also found a note in Jackson's apartment, but he declined to detail what it said. His death comes weeks after his boss, Tom Schweich, shot himself dead minutes after telling a reporter he wanted to go public with allegations he was being bullied by fellow Republicans. Scroll down for video . Double tragedy: Spence Jackson, left, has been found dead just a month after his boss, Missouri state auditor Tom Schweich, right, took his life amid rumors he was the victim of a bullying campaign . Investigation: Jefferson City Police Department Captain Doug Shoemaker answers questions during a news conference on Monday, hours after Jackson was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gun wound . Shoemaker said police were aware of the political issues surrounding the deaths, but that investigators wouldn't comment 'or really entertain questions that might link Jackson to any type of political issue, whether it's perceived or real'. Police said there was no physical evidence of a forced entry or struggle, but that an autopsy is planned for Monday and detectives are continuing to investigate the case. Schweich, who launched his Republican gubernatorial campaign in January and was considered a frontrunner, was targeted by state GOP Chairman John Hancock, according to his supporters. Hancock allegedly told people that Schweich - who was Christian but had Jewish ancestry - was Jewish with the implication that it was a negative attribute in a gubernatorial campaign. The auditor had expressed angst to friends that he believed he was the victim of 'an anti-Semitic whispering campaign'. On February 26, he shot himself at his Clayton home just minutes after telling an Associated Press reporter about the tactics. Schweich, 54, left behind his wife Kathleen and their two young children, Emilie and Thomas. Scrutiny: Schweich supporters accused state GOP Chairman John Hancock, pictured, of falsely claiming he was Jewish to damage his gubernatorial campaign. Police have found no evidence of the bullying . Heartbroken: Schweich's relatives comfort each other outside his funeral on March 3, a week after he shot himself dead. Just moments earlier, he told reporters he wanted to go public with the bullying claims . At his funeral days later, former U.S. Sen. John Danforth, an Episcopal priest, suggested during his eulogy that Schweich had been driven to kill himself by political bullying. Some Schweich supporters called on Hancock to resign or for the Republican state committee to remove him. Jackson was among those who had called for Hancock's resignation. But a week ago, Clayton Police Detective Lt. Don Bass said Schweich left behind no suicide note and that detectives have found no evidence that he was the target of political bullying. 'I think everybody's looking for a rational reason for an irrational act ... but right now we're not finding anything,' Bass said, adding that based on 'the leads and sources that we have heard from, we have not been able to prove that there was a whispering campaign'. Hancock has also denied the allegation and said that he has received support from the state committee to continue in his role. After the death of his boss, Jackson continued to work as the auditor's spokesperson. He had started working as Schweich's media director in May 2011 after holding several key Republican jobs in state government. At work: Jackson, pictured in January 2002, had several key Republican jobs in state government .

Following news of Jackson's death, Blunt released a statement about his 'hard-working, well-liked and quick-witted' friend and former colleague. 'Melanie and I are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Spence Jackson who was a good friend for many years,' it read. 'Spence was a gifted communicator who dedicated his talents in public affairs to public service...He will truly be missed. We mourn his passing and offer our prayers to his family and friends.' After working for Blunt, Jackson moved to the Missouri Department of Economic Development, where he worked for just over two years.","Spence Jackson, 44, was found dead inside his apartment from a self-inflicted gun wound on Sunday after taking a sick day on Friday .

"A former equality chief has branded his years working to stamp out racial discrimination as 'utterly wrong'. Writer and broadcaster Trevor Phillips said efforts made under the Blair government turned anti-racism into an 'ugly new doctrine'. Mr Phillips is the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission and has waged a 30-year campaign to tackle issues around discrimination and equality. In an upcoming Channel 4 documentary, called Things We Won't Say About Race That Are True, he says attempts to stop prejudice instead encouraged abuse and endangered lives as well as contributed to the rise of parties like Ukip. Trevor Phillips, who was the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said efforts made under the Blair government to end racial discrimination were 'wrong' In the 75-minute documentary, he delves into Britain's racial tensions and stereotypes as well as hostilities towards immigrants. He explains: 'It was my job to to make sure that different racial and religious groups got on. 'Campaigners like me seriously believed that if we could prevent people expressing prejudiced ideas then eventually they would stop thinking them. 'But now I'm convinced we were utterly wrong.' Mr Phillips, a Labour party member, says anti-racism began with good intentions but turned into 'thought control'. He says the London 2005 bombing by British Muslims, forced him to do rethink his views. Now, he insists that only a willingness to talk more openly about race, despite risk of causing offence, will help those in need. Mr Phillips interviews Ukip leader Nigel Farage (left) and former prime minister Tony Blair (right) for the documentary, which airs March 19 . In the documentary, which airs on March 19, Mr Phillips asks Nigel Farage whether attempts to embrace diversity have led to the rise of Ukip. He also also talks to Tony Blair about how the work begun by New Labour in support of diversity and equality can be revived. Former England footballer Les Ferdinand will also feature in the documentary to highlight racial issues in the sport. And former home secretary Jack Straw, who is also interviewed, tells Mr Phillips that many MPs are wary of expressing their views for fear of being branded racist. But Mr Phillips insists people should be free to use racial stereotypes, such as that many Jews are rich or that black people are more likely to be convicted for robbery, because they are true. Explaining the issue, he said: 'The dividing lines of race, religion and culture are probably the most dangerous flashpoints in Britain today, but they're also the ones we find hardest to talk about in public. Former footballer Les Ferdinand, who is now Director of Football at Queens Park Rangers, will also feature on the programme, to discuss racial issues in the sport . 'This film points to ways in which we can say what's on our minds without being accused of being bigots.' Channel 4 head of specialist factual David Glover, who commissioned the documentary, said: 'This film contains some very uncomfortable facts about race. 'Trevor Phillips now strongly believes that it's important to get them out there, so ultimately we can understand and tackle them. 'Trevor is arguably the best-qualified person in the country to examine these issues,' he continued. 'What's fascinating is that having thought so deeply about them, he now has a very different approach to the subject than he used to.'","Trevor Phillips was head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission .
