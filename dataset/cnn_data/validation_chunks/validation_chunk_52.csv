"Bookings to Cuba jumped 57 percent for one New York tour operator in the weeks after Washington said it would renew ties with Havana. In February, they were up 187 per cent; and so far this month, nearly 250 per cent. The boom is just one sign that the rush is on to see Cuba now — before, as many predict, McDonald's claims a spot in Old Havana and Starbucks moves in on Cubita, the island's premium coffee brand. The sense that detente will unleash an invasion of Yankee tourists and change the unique character of one of the world's last remaining bastions of communism is shared by many travelers flocking here. Bookings to Cuba have spiked since news of the US government restoring ties with the government in Havana . Bookings to Cuba jumped 57 percent for one New York tour operator in the weeks after it was announced that the US would restore diplomatic ties, despite the fact that the American embargo remains largely in place . 'Cuba has a very authentic atmosphere which you see nowhere else in the world,' Gay Ben Aharon of Israel said while walking through Revolution Square. 'I wanted to see it before the American world ... but also the modern Western world comes here.' Outsiders may romanticize the 'time-capsule' nation, but many on the island are ready for change. Where foreigners see charming, historic architecture, bright 1950s-era American cars and vast stretches of white-sand beaches, locals see decaying buildings in need of repair, new vehicles priced beyond their reach and a lack of economic opportunity. For many Cubans living in dilapidated, multigeneration tenements, change could be good. It may expand access to the Internet and the outside world, creating engagement that could bring brighter economic days and, practically speaking, make it easier to fix a leaky roof. 'We're very excited,' said Yadiel Carmenate, a 26-year-old English major at the University of Matanzas who moonlights as a tour guide. It's unlikely Cuba will see major changes overnight. Talks to take the first steps toward normalized relations are just beginning and there is stiff opposition in the US Congress to lifting the 53-year-old embargo that bars most trade with and travel to the island. Still, the December announcement appears to have sparked an influx of tourism. The  sense that the future will unleash an invasion of Yankee tourists and change the unique character of one of the world's last remaining bastions of communism is shared by many travelers flocking to Cuba . A tourist gets out of a classic American car in Havana, Cuba. The Washington and Havana December announcement that they would move toward arapprochement appears to have sparked an influx of tourism . InsightCuba, the tour operator based in New Rochelle, New York, is adding excursions as its monthly bookings explode compared with early 2014. 'It's a huge surge,' company president Tom Popper said. 'Word's gotten out and people are communicating that they want to go before Cuba changes.' Already this year, more foreigners are roaming the cobblestoned streets of Old Havana. Cuba saw a 16 percent increase in visitors in January compared with a year earlier, a total of about 371,000. Tourism, a $2.6 billion-plus industry, is one of the main engines that has kept Cuba's economy sputtering along. Last year, the country welcomed 3 million visitors, a record. About 600,000 U.S. travelers are estimated to visit Cuba each year, most of them Cuban-Americans visiting family but also tens of thousands coming on approved cultural, religious and educational exchanges. An untold number of others have, for years, skirted travel restrictions by journeying through third countries such as the Bahamas or Mexico. Cuban officials estimate that 1.5 million Americans would travel here annually if all restrictions were removed, supplanting Canada as the No. 1 source of tourism and potentially adding some $2 billion a year to state coffers. However, the island is hardly ready for a Yankee invasion. Already it strains to accommodate travelers during the December-April high season. Tourists pose for a photo while sipping on a cocktail at the Bodeguita del Medio Bar frequented by the late American novelist Ernest Hemingway, in Old Havana, Cuba . Foreigners see charming, historic architecture, classic cars and white-sand beaches, but locals see decaying buildings in need of repair, new vehicles priced beyond their reach and a lack of economic opportunity . Tourists trying to dine at high-end private restaurants are often struggling to find an empty table these days, and it's practically impossible to get a room at Havana's best hotels. Some travel agents report being turned away when trying to book group reservations. Rogelio Gauvin, a tourist from Canada, predicts demand will continue to outpace capacity. 'I see a lot of construction, very nice restorations — that's very good,' he said. 'But there won't be enough hotels. There won't be enough restaurants. There won't be enough services to accommodate the Americans who will come like rats on a ship.' Privately run B&Bs and diners that have mushroomed under President Raul Castro's economic reforms could help ease the load on the government's 64,000 hotel rooms and bland, poorly stocked restaurants. The recently renovated Havana airport is set to undergo a $207 million expansion led by Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht. Several U.S. airlines have talked of launching service to the island; currently all US-Cuba flights are operated by charter companies. Canada-based Cuba Cruise has begun marketing its sea voyages directly to Americans. Already this year, more foreigners are roaming Cuba's cobble stoned streets. The country saw a 16 percent increase in visitors in January compared with a year earlier . Some tour operators hope that the Cuban government creates a quota of capacity for visitors that aren't American . Travel agents that have been doing business here for years are aware that the competition is about to get a lot stiffer. Carlos Javier Rodriguez, head of Argentina-based tour operator Carimar Eventos, expressed hope that Cuba would reserve some quota of capacity for non-US travelers. 'We tour operators,' he said, 'can say that we view the arrival of American tourism with trepidation.' For now, Rodriguez is busy tending to travelers interested 'in experiencing this Cuba, and right away.' Carmenate, the university student and tour guide, dismisses concerns that the island will lose its character. Cubans, he said, eagerly await change but won't allow their country to become the capitalist playground it was before the 1959 revolution. 'It's not going to be that way. Our identity, we will preserve it at all cost,' he said. 'That's why I think that it's going to be really hard for you to find a McDonald's or a Starbucks right down the corner.' Thomas Mieszkowski, a 28-year-old tourist from Leeds, England, however, was among the visitors taking in the experience of seeing Cuba now — before, he said, it risks becoming 'another outpost of Florida.' Some non-US visitors to Cuba are afraid that the US opening up to the island risks it becoming 'another outpost of Florida.' Tourists cross traffic lights in Havana, Cuba.

"Video footage has emerged showing a naked Air Force veteran running around his Atlanta apartment complex before police arrived on the scene and shot him dead. In the footage obtained by WSBTV, Anthony 'Tony' Hill, 27, can be seen walking outside the Heights at Chamblee apartment complex, climbing balconies and crawling around on the floor. Police responded to reports that an unclothed man was running around the complex and banging on people's doors. Officers arrived at the apartments just after 1pm on Monday. One witness told WSBTV that he told Hill to go inside otherwise he was going to get arrested. Scroll down for video . Erratic: A video shows 27-year-old Air Force veteran Anthony Hill walking around an apartment complex naked on Monday afternoon; he was later shot and killed by responding police officers . Concerns: Neighbors called police to report the naked man on balconies and knocking on doors . 'He was acting crazy but he was calm like he didn't know where he was,' said the witness, who did not wish to be identified. 'He was like kind of lost in his face.' An officer approached him and Hill turned towards him, authorities said. 'When the male saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer,' said DeKalb County Director of Public Safety Cedric Alexander. 'The officer called on him to step back, drew his weapon and fired two shots.' Witness Oscar Perez told ABC11Alive: 'The man, he was liked drugged, but he was naked and he was crawling. I think the police officer thought he was going to attack, so he shot him.' Hill was shot in the upper torso. The officer, who is white, is a seven-year veteran of the Dekalb County Police Department. He has not been identified. County police chief Cedric Alexander told reporters that the officer had been equipped with a Taser at the time of the shooting. He would not comment on whether the officer should have used the Taser but said that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation would take over the probe into the shooting. Veteran: Police said it was reasonable to assume that Hill, who was an Air Force veteran who had served in the Middle East, was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the incident . Killed: Hill, pictured with his girlfriend Bridget, was shot after he ran at the officer, police have said . Heartbroken: Bridget took to Twitter on Monday to share her anguish over the death of her boyfriend . Shocked: Bridget said the couple had been celebrating three years together on Monday . He added that he could 'reasonably assume' that Hill was possible suffering from mental illness at the time, given his behavior. On his social media profiles, Hill had used the hashtag '#IAmBipolar'. In his final Facebook post on Monday morning, Hill wrote: 'Where i once saw death i only see life.' Social media also shows Hill was an Air Force veteran who had served in the Middle East. His girlfriend, Bridget Anderson, wrote on Twitter on Monday: 'My boyfriend was SHOT AND KILLED today by an officer. HE WAS UNARMED. Never in a million years did I think this would happen. 'I thought cops were suppose to protect and serve???? THEY TOOK THE LOVE OF MY LIFE AWAY!!!!!' She added on Twitter that Monday had been their three-year anniversary. Scene: Hill was shot twice by a white officer at the Heights of Chamblee apartment complex in Atlanta . Dekalb County police chief Dr Cedric Alexander, pictured last year, said the officer was also carrying a Taser . 'Who will I share my secrets with now?' she wrote. 'Who will I call when something good happens? How will I move on from this? Lord give me the strength.' Police forces across the country have come under fire for their use of lethal force, especially against ethnic minorities, the poor and the mentally ill. Mr Alexander added: 'We have already, as many departments have begun to do, look at how do we expand our mental health training. It appears that we're seeing more and more of these cases across the country in which police are engaging with those who may be in distress.' Hill is at least the third African-American since last Friday who has or has appeared to have been unarmed when killed by police. Police near Denver last Friday fatally shot an unarmed man who was a wanted fugitive. On the same day, an officer in Madison, Wisconsin fatally shot a biracial 19-year-old, prompting some 2,000 students to march in the state's capital on Monday.

"EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker has called for the creation of an EU army . Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker has called for the creation of an EU army in the wake of rising tensions with Russia. The European Commission President said an EU military force would help defend the continent from Vladimir Putin's aggression. He said: 'You would not create a European army to use it immediately. 'But a common army among the Europeans would convey to Russia that we are serious about defending the values of the European Union.' He said a joint EU force would be more economical than each country individually ordering their own military kit. It would also drive further integration of the bloc's 28 member states. 'Such an army would help us design a common foreign and security policy,' the former Luxembourg prime minister said. He insisted the army would not challenge NATO's role defending Europe from Russian aggression. Mr Juncker, speaking to the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, said: 'Europe's image has suffered dramatically and also in terms of foreign policy, we don't seem to be taken entirely seriously.' The proposal is likely to infuriate Conservative backbenchers but has been welcomed in Germany. Germany's Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that 'our future as Europeans will one day be a European army' although she added 'not in the short term'. She said such a move would 'strengthen Europe's security' and 'strengthen a European pillar in the transatlantic alliance'. But Ukip's defence spokesman Mike Hookem said a European army would be 'a tragedy for the UK'. He said: 'We have all seen the utter mess the EU has made of the eurozone economy, so how can we even think of trusting them with this island's defence? 'This is simply a disaster in the making that would see Gibraltar returned to Spain and the Falkland Islands left open to an unopposed invasion by Argentina. 'Even more concerning would be the prospect of British troops under European command operating in the eastern Ukraine.' European Commission President said an EU military force would help defend continent from Vladimir Putin's aggression . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said relations between Russia and the EU are likely to be 'prickly' for many years . It comes amid warnings that relations between Russia and the EU are likely to be 'prickly' for many years. The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned that significant further sanctions could be imposed by the EU unless Moscow abided by the terms of the Ukraine ceasefire. He said under Mr Putin Russia had moved from being a partner of the West to seeing Europe as an 'adversary'. Mr Putin's view of Russia's influence over former Soviet states 'puts him at odds' with the West, Mr Hammond said. Newly mobilized Ukrainian paratroopers wait to board a helicopter as tensions rise with Russia . On BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hammond warned that further aggression by Moscow-backed separatists in Ukraine would trigger an escalation in the sanctions regime. 'We have all made clear that if there is a big assault, for example on Mariupol, that will be responded to with a significant increase in the economic pressure on Russia from the EU,' he said. Asked if that could trigger a new Cold War he said: 'I don't want to talk about cold wars, but we are clear that Russia has decided, it has made the decision that it wants to be in a strategic competition with the West, with Europe. 'It doesn't any longer see us as partners, it sees us as competitors or even adversaries and that means that we are going to have a difficult, prickly relationship with Russia probably for some time to come.' 'We don't think there can be a military resolution to this crisis. The disparity between the size of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Russian armed forces doesn't make that a sensible way to go. 'We have to insist that the rules-based system which says very clearly that you can't change international boundaries by force, is protected.' Although Mr Hammond said it was clear that 'we are not going to fight the Russians in Ukraine', the UK was providing support to Kiev. 'We are providing training, we are providing technical support, we provide them with non-lethal equipment,' he said. 'We have said that we will keep this under review.' He said that under the peace plan agreed in Minsk, Moscow has committed to handing back control of all of Ukraine's territory, including the border with Russia, by the end of this year. 'We have to hold them to that. If that doesn't happen Russia can expect the temperature to be turned up significantly,' he said. A machine gun sits inside a pro-Russian rebel trench along the front lines two kilometers from Ukrainian troops . He stressed that there was a 'hard red line' protecting Nato's Baltic members from Russian incursions, with the option of invoking the alliance's measure allowing for collective defence: 'Mr Putin knows that very well and that is what protects the Baltic states.' Mr Hammond claimed the Russian president believed he had 'some kind of strategic veto' over the freedom of action of former Soviet states. 'That puts him, frankly, at odds with our view of the post-Soviet settlement in Europe,' the Foreign Secretary said. Pressed on the Nato 2% spending target, Mr Hammond said: 'I can't tell you what will be in the Conservative manifesto, but you will find out soon enough, and I can't prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election. 'But David Cameron led the charge on the Nato 2% commitment at the summit in Wales last year.'","The European Commission President called for an EU military force .

"Impeccable style isn't something you'd necessarily associate with someone who crunches numbers for a living - let alone a man living in 16th century northern Europe. However, long before Kim Kardashian turned selfie taking into an art form, German accountant Matthaeus Schwarz was busy piecing together the world's first fashion book. In an incredible project that appears to be unique, style-obsessed Matthaeus - who was born in Augsburg, Germany, in 1497 - commissioned 137 watercolour paintings of himself over a 40 year period. Scroll down for video . Matthaeus Schwartz commissioned pictures of his flamboyant outfits over a 40 year period from the 1520s . The German accountant kept a note of when he wore each look - just as today's bloggers do . Fascinated by clothes, the flamboyant dresser began recording his appearance on parchment paper in 1520, during a time when strict laws governed the kinds of fabrics each social rank and station could wear. He initially commissioned 35 images to document his sartorial choices from childhood up to his early 20s but ended up with 101 more pictures. The extraordinary undertaking ended up spanning over 40 years and only ceased when Matthaeus reached the age of 63. As no other pictorial record like this exists, historians believe Matthaeus created the first ever fashion tome - similar to 21st century online blogs. Unlike today's fashion bloggers, Matthaeus, who spent a large part of his income on clothing, didn't have Instagram filters and Photoshop to rely on. He opted for surprisingly elaborate outfits which were an example of cutting-edge fashion of the time and used his clothes to make a political statement. He bound all his outfit paintings into a volume called the Book Of Clothes . He boldly combined patterns, colours and decoration in a variety outfits in a unique lifetime project . Matthaeus, who was born in 1497, is now regarded as the first fashion blogger . Matthaeus donned a red and yellow outfit (echoing the colours of the Holy Roman Emperor’s flag) when Charles V returned to Germany, as a show of his allegiance to Catholicism. After amassing an extensive collection of paintings, the fashion innovator had the pages bound and made into the ultimate vanity project, a volume titled Book of Clothes. Among the portraits are pictures of him  in festive clothing for the Emperor Maximilian I's visit to Augsburg in 1518, dressed up for a rich banker's wedding in 1527, and in mourning garb for his father's death in 1519. He added comments to each of the images explaining when the outfit was worn along with his Latin motto omne quare suum quiam - every because has a why. Now the tome has inspired a new set of photographs of fictional male dandies by artist and photographer Maisie Broadhead. Maisie, alongside her fashion designer sister Bella Newell and Professor Ulinka Rublack, has created five modern photographic recreations - printed to large scale - telling the fictional story of Matthew Smith, a young man from north London, who is obsessed with clothes. The modern photographs are based upon images commissioned between 1520 and 1560 by Matthaeus. A Young Man's Progress is a free exhibition held at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. It runs from Tuesday 24 March until Sunday 6 September. Artist Maisie Broadhead was inspired by Matthaeus Schwarz's life work to create a series of pictures portraying a modern dandy for an exhibition called A Young Man's Progress . Some of the illustrations captured Matthaeus in everyday activities, like opening a door .

"Pope Francis has not been able to enjoy a slice of pizza since being elected as the head of the Catholic church in March 2013. He laments that he can no longer go out for a quick bite, so one of his loyal supporters brought one to him in the most bizarre circumstance. The pontiff was waving to thousands of supporters in Naples on Saturday when a local restaurant's chef drove alongside his Popemobile and personally delivered him a pizza. Scroll down for video . Special delivery: A pizza-maker in Naples handed a home-made pie to the pontiff who has complained that he can no longer slip out for a quick slice . Grateful: A smiling Pope Francis who was on a day-trip to the southern-Italian city (pictured) accepted the pizza from the Don Ernesto pizzeria . Enzo Cacialli had one of his famous pies on hand as Pope Francis drove by the waterfront of the city revered for its great pizza. His co-worker at the Don Ernesto pizzeria filmed the incredible moment that Mr Cacialli got close enough to hand it directly to the pontiff, as frenzied crowds cheered him on. A smiling Pope Francis accepted the pizza which had 'Il Papa' - or the Pope - spelled out in dough and topped with cherry tomatoes. Cacialli - whose father made a pizza for former US president Bill Clinton in 1994 - said he was 'full of joy that he accepted a pizza straight from my hands'. He told Naples' newspaper Il Mattino that he used yellow tomatoes rather than red to reflect the colours of the Holy See. The heart-warming moment comes shortly after the Pope's interview with Mexican TV station Televista in which he spoke about his sadness at no longer being able to go out for a pizza. He said: 'The only thing I would like is to go out one day, without being recognised, and go to a pizzeria for a pizza.' It was not the only treat the pontiff received on his day-trip to Naples. He was also gifted some biscuits and sweets made by cloistered nuns who affectionately mobbed him as he sat in Naples cathedral. Handmade: The man who made the pizza for the Pope spelled out Il Papa - or the Pope - on it with dough and dressed it with yellow cherry tomatoes to resemble the Holy See . Abstainance: The Pope recently gave an interview to Mexican TV station Televista in which he spoke about his sadness at no longer being able to go out for a pizza . Their behaviour was condemned by Naples' archbishop Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe who made a special dispensation for them to leave the cloister for the papal visit. He did admit that the cookies were very good and he eats them with milk for breakfast every single day. Pope Francis also enjoyed lunch with at least 10 gay, transgender and HIV-positive inmates at a prison in Naples on Saturday. They were among 90 prisoners invited to dine with the pontiff on his day-long trip to southern-Italy. The stop-off at the Giuseppe Salvia Detention Centre in Poggioreale was not originally on his schedule, according to Italian TV station TV 2000. Breaking bread: On his day-trip to southern-Italy, Pope Francis also had lunch with 90 inmates at a local Naples prison . Invitation only: At least 10 of the inmates who dined with the pontiff at Poggioreale prison were gay, transgender or HIV-positive . Gifts: As well as the pizza, the Pontiff received other treats including some cookies specially made for him by cloistered nuns . But the Pope reportedly insisted on the meal which was prepared by the prisoners themselves. The inmates who dined with the pope were chosen by lottery from around 1,900, the Vatican Insider website has reported. And it was a very simple and 'frugal' because the Pope wants to take the time to get to know every prisoner personally, the head of a prison ministry told Vatican Radio. The prison visit formed part of a very busy day for Pope Francis in the Italian city that lies 150 miles south of Rome. Francis began praying at a sanctuary in Pompeii, before holding a string of events which include an outdoor mass and meetings with young people and the sick before heading back to the Vatican this evening.","Francis revealed he hasn't enjoyed a slice pizza since being elected  Pope .

"This shocking picture reveals the mangled wreck of a tandem bike which belonged to the 'perfect couple' who were killed in a tragic crash with a banned driver. Drug addict Nicholas Lovell was speeding in his Citroen Picasso when he ploughed into Ross, 34, and Clare Simons, 30. The couple, who had been riding the bike on the way to visit friends in Hanham, Bristol, were pronounced dead at the scene. This shocking picture reveals the mangled wreck of a tandem bike which belonged to 'perfect couple' Ross, 34, and Clare Simons, 30, who were tragically killed by a banned driver . Mr and Mrs Simons were killed almost instantly when drug addict Nicholas Lovell's speeding Citroen Picasso ploughed into them . Lovell - who has 69 previous convictions - was later jailed for just ten-and-a-half years for causing their deaths. Now relatives of the Simons have released the dramatic picture of the aftermath of the crash as part of their campaign for tougher sentences for banned drivers. It shows how the car snapped the bike clean in half, with the front half getting lodged in the grille. Heroin addict Lovell, 38, had crashed into the couple as he tried to outrun police - with a 16 month old baby and 12-year-old in his vehicle. A court hearing in May 2013 heard that he then left them dying by the side of the road and while awaiting sentencing bragged to other inmates that he would get away 'with four years'. The couple's tandem bike, which they had been riding at the time of the crash, was snapped clean in half by the force of the crash . Jailing Lovell at Bristol Crown Court in May 2013, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: 'This is the worst example one could imagine of this sort of offence. 'You have a serious drug problem but your deep selfishness and disregard for others is breathtaking.' His partner Louise Cox, 35, was jailed for twelve months for trying to cover up the fact he was illegally driving her Citroen Picasso. Lovell - who has 69 previous convictions - was later jailed for just ten-and-a-half years for causing their deaths . Lovell pleaded guilty to two counts of death by dangerous driving and was given the maximum possible sentence under current guidelines. But Ross and Clare's family reckon he will be released after five years - meaning he will serve just two-and-a-half years for each life he took. On Thursday, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling visited the site with local Kingswood MP Chris Skidmore and the family to discuss further changes and lay flowers. One potential change includes making sure sentences for multiple deaths are served one after the other, instead of at the same time. Mr Grayling said: 'I don't like the idea of people like this coming out half way through the sentence. 'It is shocking to walk here in a normal suburban street and see what can happen. I can only imagine the trauma and turmoil the family must have been through.' Kelly Woodruff, 33, Ross's sister, said the family would continue to fight for tougher laws in the hope of preventing future deaths. She thanked Mr Skidmore, who has supported the Justice for Ross and Clare campaign from the start. Mr Skidmore said: 'We have fought the campaign to get laws changed, which could already prevent future deaths but we want to go further. 'We want to keep this at the top of the agenda for whoever is in government to increase maximum sentences further.' The crash happened in Hanham, Bristol, near the couple's home in January 2013. In the run up to the collision a police officer in a patrol car recognised Lovell behind the wheel and knew he was banned. The scene in Bristol where tandem cyclists Ross and Clare Simons died after they were hit by Lovell - who has 69 previous convictions . Lovell failed to stop when the officer switched on his blue light, disappearing from view. Witnesses had described Lovell driving as 'exceptionally erratic, fast and dangerous'- with the speedo hitting 60mph- before they heard a 'loud, horrendous bang.' The court heard that Lovell was seen getting out of the steaming wreckage, followed by Cox who was cradling her baby. But the force of the impact instantly killed Ross and Clare, from Staple Hill, Bristol and left their new tandem bike in three pieces. Lovell fled the scene and left lying Cox to tell police a mystery man in a red sweater had been driving, leading detectives on a wild goose chase before Lovell handed himself in the next day when traces of drugs were found in his body. Despite finally pleading guilty, Lovell has never apologised for causing the couple's death. He also admitted driving while disqualified. Fifteen years ago Lovell warned he would either kill or be killed through his reckless driving. Piles of tributes were left to the popular couple and now their family have been campaigning for tougher sentences for banned drivers . Kelly Woodruff, 33, Ross's sister, said the family would continue to fight for tougher laws in the hope of preventing future deaths . He already had 13 convictions for driving whilst disqualified since 1991 and a further four for dangerous driving since 1995 before he killed Ross and Clare. In one incident he tried to escape police by driving through a subway. On another he sped along a pavement forcing people to leap out of his way. His warning about killing came in 1998 after a 70mph head-on crash with another car in Bristol when he was high on drugs. Lovell only stopped then when his clapped-out Rover lost a wheel. In addition, Lovell has been repeatedly jailed for violent crimes to fuel his lifelong heroin habit. In 2003 he was jailed for five years for an armed robbery at a shop, while in 2006 - within weeks of being released - he committed an aggravated burglary and got another 12 months in prison. In 2009 he was given yet another ban for dangerous driving - but each time he has simply ignored the courts and carried on as before. In sharp contrast, Ross and Clare were described as ‘a perfect couple' by relatives who held candlelit vigils at the scene of their.

Ross' sister Kelly Woodruff said at the time of court case: 'They were two amazing people and so, so loved. To have them taken away from us is heart-wrenching. 'They were the perfect couple. They loved each other unconditionally, they were made for each other.' Ross' father Edwin Simons had added: 'He is going to serve three years for each of our children's lives. 'With his considerable history it needs looking into because this has gone on for years and years.' Kelly Woodruff, Ross' sister said in 2013: 'The people who took their lives will never understand what they have taken away from us and have never shown remorse. 'We and those close to Ross and Clare have been given life sentences. 'We are all truly devastated by the loss.

"A Michelin-starred restaurant in London has become the first in the country where customers will have to pay before they eat. The Clove Club in Shoreditch is implementing a ticketing system in June to reduce the number of cancellations it has to deal with. The system Tock was originally developed by Chicago restaurateur Nick Kokonas who owns Alinea, which frequently appears in the world's best restaurants list. Clove Club in Shoreditch, London is headed by one-Michelin-starred chef Isacc McHale . The Clove Club's Head chef Isaac McHale says the cost of cancellations can be damaging for businesses. 'It's going to ruffle a few feathers,' he said in an interview with Bloomberg. 'But everyone has a problem with no shows and short-seated tables. 'The more ambitious your restaurant, the more money you spend on ingredients and staff, and you want to keep prices down. We tend to have very high break-evens.' The restaurant interior where customers will be able to dine on the £65 five-course menu or . Chicago restaurateur Nick Kokonas developed the booking system Tock . Five Course Dinner Menu . Italian Style Air Dried Ham (Saddleback, September, 2013) £18 . A Selection of Snacks to Start . Flamed Cornish Mackerel, Rhubarb & Toasted Oats . Raw Orkney Scallop, Hazelnut, Clementine & Perigord Truffle (£12 Supp.) Roast Cornish Pollock, Carrots, Seaweed & Orange Butter . Yorkshire Suckling Pig & South Indian Spices . Amalfi Lemonade & Sarawak Pepper Ice Cream . Warm Blood Orange, Ewe’s Milk Yoghurt Mousse & Wild Fennel Granita . £65 . Wine Pairing £50 . According to the Bloomberg, from June onwards diners will be offered a choice of two tasting menus costing either £65 or £95. The entire cost of the meal must be paid for in advance - although drinks and extra items can be settled on the day. The system works very much along the lines of sport, theatre or gig bookings, and will see diners forfeit the price of their meals if they don't show up. 'By the time someone walks into our restaurant we have already spent a lot of money on ingredients and on getting the right amount of staff, so if they cancel it is very expensive for us,' Mr McHale said to The Telegraph. 'Diners used to lose deposits if they didn't show up but we want to give people good hospitality and it offends guests when they have to give their credit card details before they arrive.' On its website, The Clove Club says: 'The Clove Club is a restaurant in Shoreditch Town Hall in East London. 'Built in 1865, the Town Hall was for over 100 years one of the grandest vestry halls in the city. Having ceased to be a home for local government during the 1960s it is now a popular arts and events space, run by Shoreditch Town Hall Trust. 'At The Clove Club we serve an ambitious five course menu and an extended menu, featuring interesting and often overlooked British ingredients and produce. 'In our front room we also have a bar which guests are welcome to drop in for a drink and a snack.'","System will be implemented in June this year at the Shoreditch restaurant .

"France is one step closer to legalising euthanasia after approving a bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die. The bill stops short of recommending lethal injections and avoids the terms euthanasia or assisted suicide, but would give people 'the right to deep, continuous sedation until death'. This must be at the patient's request, but only when their condition is life-threatening in the short-term. Protests: Demonstrators gather near the French National Assembly holding white silhouettes as part of a silent protest against euthanasia in Paris on March 10. Slogans read: 'Let's relieve but do not kill' On March 10. pro-euthanasia demonstrators held signs reading: 'Francois let's act like Holland'. Euthanasia has been taking place in Holland for many years . The proposed measure was passed by a vote of 436 to 34 in France's lower house of Parliament, and it must now be debated by the Senate. Backed by the Socialist government, the bill would also force doctors in France to follow end-of-life instructions expressed by the patients themselves, or written in advance if they are no longer able to state their wishes. Almost one in 20 people in northern Belgium died using euthanasia in 2013, more than doubling the numbers in six years, a study released today showed. The universities of Ghent and Brussels found that since euthanasia was legalised in 2002, the acceptance of ending a life at the patient's request has greatly increased. While a 2007 survey showed 1.9 percent of deaths from euthanasia in the region, the figure was 4.6 percent in 2013. 'Euthanasia has been increasingly accepted by the patients as a valid option at the end of their life,' said Ghent University ethics professor Freddy Mortier. 'Physicians themselves are more inclined to comply with the wishes of the patients."" Euthanasia is legal only in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg . Earlier this month in a speech at France's lower house of Parliament, Prime minister Manuel Valls praised 'a reform that proclaims the right to die peacefully, in dignity and without suffering'. The bill has stirred debate in France and prompted a call for the preservation of 'the prohibition of killing' by five high-profile Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders. It has prompted protests by those claiming the bill amounts to disguised euthanasia, as well as pro-euthanasia campaigners who believe it does not go far enough. Doctors are also divided about the idea. So-called terminal or 'palliative sedation' can involve medicating patients until they die naturally of their illnesses, or until they starve. The method does not actively kill patients, but some doctors say it can mean patients are sedated for weeks before they die, and that it may be more humane to euthanise. French debate over end-of-life legislation resurfaced last year over the case of comatose Frenchman Vincent Lambert. His wife wants doctors to stop life support but his parents disagree. The case is pending at the European Court of Human Rights. Some protesters claim the new bill amounts to disguised euthanasia, while others say it doesn't go far enough .","France approves a bill allowing doctors to sedate patients until they die .

"Teacher Jeremiah Gorman, 35, was being investigated for child pornography posession when he was found dead in a motel room on Saturday . A Maine teacher who was being investigated for possession of child pornography was found dead in a motel room. Jeremiah Gorman, 35, was a social sciences teacher at John Bapst Memorial High School in Bangor and had been placed under investigation just the day before his body was discovered on Saturday. Mel MacKay, the school's head of administration, said law enforcement officials believe Gorman died in an apparent suicide. The private school was informed on Friday that Gorman, who has a son, was under investigation. Detectives had asked for his classroom to be opened for a search,  MacKay wrote in an email sent out to parents and students, according to the Bangor Daily News. Gorman's home had also been searched. MacKay said that Monday's school day would begin with a special assembly regarding the matter and that counseling services would be available to all students, faculty and staff. 'This has been an extraordinarily fast-developing situation in which issues of student and child safety have been at the forefront, as they must always be,' he wrote. 'At the same time, we are aware that the emotional needs of students, parents, faculty and staff, and Mr Gorman's own family call for our attention and support.'

"A company director who shaved her hair off before starting chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer has raised thousands of pounds for charity - by decorating her bald head for daily selfies. Internet sensation Sara Cutting has marked each day of her treatment by posing for a photo in a different hat, including designs made out of bread, cake, coffee cups, a radio, a lampshade and even a carrot. The 46-year-old then uploads the smiling selfies onto her Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page for her friends, family and followers, while urging people to donate to MacMillan Cancer Support. Sara Cutting was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and decided to do a Different Daily Head Gear selfie challenge after shaving off all of her hair for chemotherapy . You would hope Sara didn't get neck ache from carrying this giant radio around on her head . Sara has been seriously inventive when it comes to picking out different head dresses, here she balanced a whole cake on her head . Sara discovered she had breast cancer last year after finding a lump whilst moisturising, before chemotherapy she decided to shave all of her hair off . And now on day 141, she has already raised more than £8,000  for the charity, which she credits for supporting her through her treatment and recovery. Miss Cutting shaved off her shoulder-length blonde hair when she began chemotherapy in October. She has now finished the treatment and begins a four-week course of radiotherapy next Monday. She hopes to raise £10,000 in total and the determined fundraiser, who owns a building and renovation company with her 39-year-old partner Liam Copsey, even took part in the Brighton Half Marathon last month. Miss Cutting, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: 'I shaved my hair off before it fell out because it felt like I would be taking control of the cancer, rather than the cancer controlling me. 'Life has to go on and you have to find a way of coping, so this has been a really good focus for me. It's a reason for me to get my make up on, get dressed and put on a big smile, no matter how I'm feeling. 'I wanted to do something to raise awareness of breast cancer and to thank MacMillan Cancer Support, which has supported me through all of this.' When Sara first started her challenge she was pleased to realise that she had raised £1000 in just two days . Sata has had to be very creative to come up with all of her ideas but she says that they have been helping her get through the process of chemotherapy . This brilliant straw head-dress makes Sara look a little bit like a scarecrow as the straw covers her bald head . During her journey Sara says that her friends have been kind enough to help her out not only with support, but with lending her some of her head gear . Miss Cutting was applying moisturiser to her body after a shower when she discovered a lump on her breast in July last year. She was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer, and within weeks she had surgery to remove the tumour and affected lymph nodes from her right breast. The operation was a success, but in October she began chemotherapy to ensure any stray cancer cells would be caught, too. Miss Cutting said: 'I went to the doctors about something unrelated to all this and just mentioned I'd been getting some dry skin under my arm pit. 'I was told to start using moisturiser after my shower to help prevent it, and one day when I was putting my body lotion on, I lifted my arm up and felt this lump on my breast. 'The following day I went to my GP, who referred me to the local breast care clinic. Within two weeks I was told I had a very aggressive form of cancer. It was such a shock - it still hasn't quite sunk in now.' This look, which features long strands of chain dangling down into Sara's face wouldn't be out of home in Lady Gaga's wardrobe . Sara says that the news that she had cancer still hasn't really sunk in but her friends and family have been a great support . Maybe Sara was hoping to catch some rain water with this hairband complete with a bucket attached to it . She continued: 'Soon after I had the operation to remove the tumour from my breast and remove the affected lymph nodes from there, too. 'The doctors think it went well as they can't see any more cancer there, but they still wanted to do the chemotherapy, just to be on the safe side..' It was then Miss Cutting decided to have her shoulder-length blonde hair shaved off and begin her one year Different Daily Headgear Challenge. She has since been inundated with donations from friends and strangers, and had several hats designed for her. The bubbly fundraiser is also accepting donations of headwear in her bid to reach her target of a daily selfie for 365 days. She hopes that her quirky challenge will help raise awareness and get more women and men to check their bodies for signs of breast cancer. One of Sara's most over-stated headdresses featured giant flowers on what looked like blue playes . Caroline clearly enjoys taking all of her pictures, always smiling happily at the camera as she tries to post a selfie every day for a year . Caroline says her partner has even been helping out and his kind-hearted young daughter offered to shave her head as well . Miss Cutting said: 'The treatment is hard and it absolutely knocks me for six, but it has to be done and I just take it day by day. 'There are always days when I'll feel I can't muster the energy to dress up, take a photo and post it on social media, but I have to and that has been good for me.' She added: 'Within two days of starting the campaign I'd raised 1,000 pounds. 'I have such amazing support from my friends, family and strangers, who have heard about what I'm doing. Liam's daughter Pippa is only 13 and she even offered to shave her hair off, too!' In one of Caroline's more elaborate outfits she decided not only to wear a giant head dress but to wear a matching bikini top as well . Caroline has used her project to encourage other people who may also suffer with breast cancer . Caroline wore this ballet themed head dress of pink fur covered in dancing shoes . And while the challenge was set up to help others, Sara says her daily selfies are also getting her through this difficult time. She added: 'Life has to go on and you have to find a way of coping, so this has been a really good focus for me. 'It's a reason for me to get my make up on, get dressed and put on a big smile, no matter how I'm feeling, and if I can encourage one more man or woman to check their breasts, then it is all worth it.' Caroline always makes sure to make every single picture different, posing at different angles and in different locations . Some of Sara's more silly head-dresses have included a lampshade and this pink shower cap . A Christmas themed post showed Sara with glittering antlers attached to a cosy looking fur hood .","Sara Cutting shaved her head off before started chemotherapy  last year .

"A private Pennsylvania college expelled three students who made racist comments and used a slur during a late-night campus radio broadcast. Bucknell University president John Bravman said in a email that he would share the comments made by the students, a DJ and two guests,  in the 'interest of transparency and candor'. Bravman said one of the students used the N-word during the March 20 WVBU-FM broadcast. Another student said 'black people should be dead' and a third said 'lynch 'em'. Private Pennsylvania college Bucknell University expelled three students who made racist comments, including 'black people should be dead' and 'lynch 'em', and the N-word during a campus radio broadcast . The university has not released the names of the expelled students. Bravman revealed the expulsions in a late-night email sent to students, faculty and staff on Monday. 'Their conduct is an affront to our values, damaging to our community and in clear violation of our community standards,' he wrote . Bucknell spokesman Andy Hirsch said that the incident didn't come to the administration's attention until last Thursday, according to PennLive.com. It was an inmate at the nearby Lewisburg federal penitentiary who heard the students' comments and brought them to light. President John Bravman (pictured) said he'd share the comments made by the students, a DJ and two guests, in the 'interest of transparency and candor' Hirsch said the inmate reported the broadcast to  the Lewisburg Prison Project, a prisoner advocacy group. The group contacted a university faculty member, who then reached out to the student-run radio station's adviser. According to Hirsch, the three students were suspended and interviewed before the dean of students decided to expel them. 'I would emphasize that the context really doesn't matter once you see what was said,' Hirsch said. The spokesman declined to say if alcohol was involved, noting the investigation is not complete. 'I can tell you that there were other people at the station,' he said. 'Whether or not they were there at the time when this happened, we're still looking into all those details.' The Bucknell student body is 79 per cent white, five per cent Hispanic, four per cent Asian and three per cent African-American. After the comments were revealed last Thursday, Bravman sent a message to the entire campus community declaring the behavior 'unacceptable and inexcusable'. 'This is not who we are,' he wrote. 'In fact, it is the antithesis of what so many of our students, faculty and staff are working hard to attain - a more diverse and inclusive environment.' 'I urge you to defy this detestable conduct by not letting it thwart our progress toward a greater Bucknell.' It was an inmate at the nearby Lewisburg federal penitentiary (pictured) who heard the students' comments and brought them to light by contacting a prisoner advocacy group, which then reached out to the university .","Bucknell University president John Bravman said one student used N-word and another said 'black people should be dead'

"It was for years a weekly ritual, marked by teenagers sitting in their bedrooms earnestly pressing the record and pause buttons to capture their favourite tunes while desperately trying to avoid including the presenter's commentary. But now the Sunday night tradition of recording the top 40 on a cassette when dozens of children promised their parents they were in fact doing homework, has come to an end after almost 50 years. The BBC has announced it is moving the top 40 show from its usual Sunday afternoon slot, made famous by presenters including Tony Blackburn and Alan Freeman, to a Friday evening to meet the demands of the global digital music industry. Alan Freeman launched BBC Radio 1's first official countdown show with Pick of the Pops in 1967 and since then the show became a cultural staple on Sunday evenings, known by many children who taped it on cassette - it will now be moved to Fridays as the music industry becomes more focused on digital downloads . The change comes after the music industry agreed a global release date for singles and albums, as digital downloads and streaming replace the traditional music store as a measure of popularity. As well as the change of slot, the show will be shorter, giving less time for all songs in the charts to be played. But station controller Ben Cooper has has denied the move means the chart was being 'downgraded', claiming it had to 'adapt or die.' UK singles currently come out on Sundays and albums a day later, but the The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) - which represents the worldwide record industry - announced last month they were introducing Friday as a global release day from summer. This makes use of digital downloads, which mean music can be downloaded anywhere in the world at the same time. The Sunday night chart has recently started including digital downloads in the top 40 rankings. Radio 1's Greg James, pictured with former presenter Fearne Cotton (left) and presenter Gemma Cairney (right), will present the new top 40 run-down, which will be an hour shorter than the current show on Fridays . Mr Cooper said: 'The days of having your fingers on record and pause with a cassette, taping your favourite songs from the chart, are long gone. Radio 1 now operates in an instant digital world.' A chart countdown has been part of Radio 1's Sunday evening programme since 1967, with Alan Freeman's Pick of the Pops. From 1987 the show was the first to announce the UK's number one each week - but this will now change to Fridays, with the official top 40 compiled on Friday morning. Station controller Ben Cooper said the move did not mean the chart was being 'downgraded' In the 1980s the show attracted more than 4million listeners, with teenagers proudly showing off their recording skills on Sony Walkmans the next day. In recent years the number of listeners has fallen to 1.2million. Mr Cooper said the new show would have to be 'a little more choosy' about which tracks it played but pointed out the current three-hour long show does not play all 40 tracks. He said the top 20 would be played every week. He added: 'If anything this gives the chart a new lease of life, it gives it an exposure to a new audience on a Friday afternoon and it gives it a new presenter and it gives it a new format. It's going to have to be tighter and slicker. 'If we don't adapt we will die.' Starting in mid-July, the new show will be two hours long, focusing on the top 20, and will be accompanied by a live TV programme on CBBC. The IFPI hopes that by synchronising release dates around the world, there will be more excitment built up around new singles and it will decrease piracy. It will mean people will be able to access songs at the same time anywhere around the world and will help artists who wish to publicise their music through social media. Mr Cooper said the Sunday night show, presented by Clara Amfo, attracts around 1.2 million listeners, while Greg James pulls in more than 5 million across the week. James backed the move, saying: 'The chart must feel like it's providing news, not just confirmation of something the listeners already knew.' The Sunday slot is expected to be filled with a new show co-produced with CBBC in a big to bring a younger audience to the station. Alan Freeman launched the countdown to the UK's number one with his Pick of the Pops, airing in 1967. Freeman's show originally featured the top 20 songs and announced the UK's number one, after the full top 40 was announced on the Tuesday the week before. However the show later became known as The Radio 1 Chart Show and now The Official Chart, is the longest running music chart programme in the UK. Tony Blackburn was a popular household name when he presented the top 40 in the early 1980s . In 1987 new technology meant the show could announce the top 40 first, leading to increasing popularity with teenage listeners and the chart show becoming renowned for revealing the nation's music choices. At its height in the 1980s around 4million people tuned in every week to hear the top 40 countdown, which frequently featured interviews with the top three artists before the number one was revealed. The chart show became a 'tea time staple' in the 1980s, with many teenagers holing themselves up in their bedroom to try and record all 40 tracks on cassette tapes. Monday morning was often a time to show off to friends their skills at recording the songs. Alan Freeman started the popular countdown show, with a programme counting down the top 20 singles . It has run every single week for almost 50 years apart from on 31 August 1997, when it was replaced on BBC Radio 1 by news coverage of the death of the Princess Of Wales, Lady Diana. The Top 40 chart is first issued on Sunday afternoons from 4pm to 7pm by BBC Radio 1, before the full Official Singles Chart Top 100 is posted on the Official Charts Company's website. The way the top 40 has been compiled has changed. In 2004 the first UK official downloads chart was launched, and this became integrated with the top 40 in 2007 - showing the importance of downloaded music as well as physical purchases, which reflected the digital transformation of the industry. Jo Whiley became the first female to present the top 40 show in 2002, taking over from Mark Goodier . From July last year audio streaming is included alongside downloads and physical sales on the Singles Chart. Tony Blackburn presented the chart show from September 1979 until December 1982 before moving to BBC London and then BBC Radio 2, where he still presents a regular slot. He also earned renown during this period as the UK presenter of the Eurovision Song Contest. Mark Goodier became a well known figure for presenting the show, hosting it for two stints from September 1990 until March 1992; and from April 1995 to November 2002. Jo Whiley became the first female to present the UK Top 40 on 24 November 2002 , a week after Mark Goodier's departure from the show, as one of a string of one-off presenters each week until Scott Mills presented the UK Top 40 each week from 5 January 2003 until 2 February 2003. The show has been gradually moving from its traditional Sunday night format to embrace the digital music industry. From February 2012 a new look show started with the music videos of the top 10 singles aired live online from 6pm.","BBC's chart show is moving to Fridays for the first time in its history .

"SO YOU'VE BEEN PUBLICLY SHAMED . by Jon Ronson . (Picador £16.99) Shame stalks the land. It wakes us up at three in the morning. It inhabits the most secret corners of our lives. It’s a complete waste of time and energy, but for many of us it’s a lifetime’s work to get shot of it. I think I’ve lost most of mine, but I still have a little spare if you’re running short. At the same time, the real villains of the piece, the people who really should feel shame for what they have done and continue to do, feel none at all. Jimmy Savile was shameless. I know a few bankers, and I don’t know one who feels anything but delight that he and his kind have got away with it. So this is an important subject, and a fascinating one. Two new books consider shame from different points of view. Jon Ronson is a journalist and broadcaster who has built up something of a reputation writing about extremely odd people. For this book, however, he has spoken to normal people who found themselves in distinctly abnormal situations. For these are people who have been shamed, publicly, humiliatingly, horribly. Sometimes what they have done is pretty bad; sometimes what they have done is nothing much at all. But in each case, the judgment of the mob has been merciless. In his book, Jon Ronson insists that there is potential in everyone for this merciless judgment (stock image) Take the case of Justine Sacco, a young New York PR who tweeted this: ‘Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get Aids. Just kidding. I’m white!’ As jokes go, it’s definitely at the bad taste end of the spectrum, and it’s not one I’d make. But the point is: it was a joke. One of Justine’s 130 followers on Twitter retweeted this, then others re-re-retweeted it. When she landed at Cape Town airport, there was a text from her best friend. ‘You need to call me immediately. You’re the number one worldwide trend on Twitter right now.’ The abuse was astonishing. ‘All I want for Christmas is to see @Justine Sacco’s face when her plane lands and she checks her inbox/voicemail.’ ‘We are about to watch this @Justine Sacco b**** get fired. In REAL time. Before she even KNOWS she’s getting fired.’ And worse, much much worse. A man was waiting at the airport, took a photo of her and posted it online. Newspapers ran stories on her. She had to cut short her holiday because hotel staff were threatening to go on strike if she showed up. She was fired from her job and no one else would hire her to do anything. Her life was ruined over a bad joke. Ronson tells this terrible story in his deadpan way, his sympathies clearly with the victim. But he admits that he too has been part of a Twitter mob monstering some poor fool who had done something he didn’t approve of. This is what public shaming amounts to these days. Justice, says Ronson, has been democratised. Not all of his interviewees are so sympathetic. Take the case of Jonah Lehrer, the sharp young American hack who made up one too many quotes and was shamed into unemployment. Given the opportunity to apologise at a conference, he found that the hosts had erected a huge screen with a live Twitter feed behind his head. ‘I am not feeling terribly convinced by the deadpan mea culpa droning on by @jonahlehrer.’ ‘I can’t handle watching the @jonahlehrer apology. He is boring and unconvincing. Time for something else.’ While he was making his speech! Why not just put him in the stocks and throw rotten tomatoes at him? What this all amounts to, of course, is bullying. Worse: self-righteous, vindictive bullying. Jon Ronson’s book isn’t always the easiest read, although his characteristic wit and wonderful, sinuous way of telling a story guide you effortlessly through the horrors within its pages. He is also insistent that the potential for such behaviour is in us all. And while you’re thinking ‘No, not me’, he tells you a story that so incenses you that you can imagine taking action against the malefactor yourself. He is a clever man and this is a magnificent book, subtly argued, often painfully funny and yet deeply serious, and absolutely of the moment. I’m not sure I can recommend it highly enough. IS SHAME NECESSARY? by Jennifer Jacquet . (Allen Lane £17.99) For Jennifer Jacquet, shame is not so much a scourge as ‘a tool that we can put to use to help solve serious problems’. This young American environmentalist wishes to make corporations behave better. If we are to save the planet, then just buying dolphin-friendly tuna and energy-saving lightbulbs isn’t going to do it. No, we have to shame companies into doing what we want them to. We can do this in much the same way that Ronson’s trolls have. Shame is ‘more salient to public life than ever before, since the power to use it has been wrested away from opinion leaders and the state and put increasingly in the hands of citizens’.

"All foreign nurses, midwives and dentists will have to pass tough new English language checks before being allowed to treat patients in the UK. NHS trusts will be required to check the language competency of all their healthcare workers, before they are given licence to practise in the UK. The move marks an extension of legislation introduced early last year, which demands that all foreign doctors are now subjected to tough language checks before treating patients. Since the new law was passed 429 doctors have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Until now only nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the EU were subject to any language competency tests. All foreign nurses, midwives and dentists will be required to pass English language competency tests before treating patients in the UK after MPs voted to extend legislation introduced last year for all foreign doctors . But today MPs voted to extend the rules to cover those from member states. Today health minister Dr Dan Poulter said voting to include all healthcare professionals, as well as doctors, would offer 'better protection for patients'. Debating the final stage of the legislation, he said: 'We all value the contribution that doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals from all over the world make to our NHS, but being able to speak and communicate to a good standard of English is essential to provide high quality and safe patient care. 'These new laws will provide protection for patients and the public.' Currently the Nursing and Midwifery Council is only required to test the language skills of those nurses and midwives coming to work in the UK from outside the EU. Those moving from member states are permitted to begin work without taking a language test. The NMC said there are currently 26,474 nurses and midwives from the EU on their register, while another 66,163 are from non-European Economic Area countries. There are a total of 685,262 nurses and midwives on the register. Under the new powers if an applicant cannot provide evidence of their language competency, the NMC will be able to ask them to take an internationally recognised test. The NMC's new powers are expected to come into effect later this year. A change in the law, which was passed for doctors last year, came after German doctor Daniel Ubani killed his patient David Gray, when he confused two drugs and gave Mr Gray an overdose . Until last year when the law changed, the General Medical Council only had the powers to test the language skills of foreign doctors from outside the EU. Since 1983, the doctors' regulatory body had been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from EU countries. Last year's change in law for doctors was prompted by an 'alarming' number of cases where patients complained about poor treatment from doctors with a poor grasp of the English language. In 2008 German doctor, Dr Daniel Ubani killed his patient David Gray, when he confused two drugs. As a result Dr Ubani, who was working his first shift in the UK providing out-of-hours cover, injected Mr Gray with 10 times the recommended dose of diamorphine. An inquest later found he was unfamiliar with the drug and had poor English. The Nigerian-born medic was struck off by the General Medical Council but was able to continue working in his adopted country of Germany after the authorities there let him off with a nine-month suspended prison sentence and a small fine. In addition, an alarming 66 cases were investigated by senior NHS staff in 2011 after patients complained of inadequate treatment, citing language difficulties. In an attempt to tackle the problem, the Government proposed changing the law in September 2013. The language tests were to be introduced for the first time, for doctors arriving from the EU. Health minister, Dr Poulter added: 'As a practising NHS doctor, I know the importance of good communication skills to ensure the very best patient care. 'And I have seen first hand when poor communication has let down patients. 'As a minister, I am pleased to be using my front line healthcare experience to give our healthcare regulators these important new language testing powers, which will benefit and protect patients and the public.' The bodies that regulate nurses, midwives, dentists and pharmacists will be given the same powers as the GMC. The GMC now has the power to investigate any complaints made about doctors' poor language skills. And as part of their regular appraisals, and the new medical revalidation process for doctors, which they must pass to continue treating patients, the GMC now checks language skills of those medics from overseas.","All healthcare workers from the EU will now have to undergo language test .

"The burden of green taxes on businesses has doubled under the Coalition, according to official figures. The Treasury imposed £2.5billion of levies in 2010-11 – but the takings are predicted to reach £4.6billion in 2015-16, it emerged yesterday. Business groups have warned the taxes could lead to job losses. There are also fears that more of the costs will be passed on to customers. A written statement from Treasury minister Priti Patel stated that the Government is 'committed to increasing the proportion of tax revenue accounted for by environmental taxes' to 'encourage positive behaviour change' and make firms cut carbon emissions. The burden of green taxes on businesses has doubled under the Coalition. Pictured is the Treasury building in London . Environment campaigners say such taxes on firms' energy use set an example to other countries and will help tackle climate change – but critics point out that many of them are specific to the UK, which could encourage businesses that use a lot of energy to move abroad. One cost that has risen substantially over the past five years is the Climate Change Levy, a charge on every kilowatt hour of electricity and gas firms use to generate energy. Two years ago, another tax – the Carbon Price Floor – was introduced on every ton of carbon that firms emit. These two levies now cost businesses a combined £2billion. Larger firms have also been hit by the Energy Efficiency Scheme to further reduce carbon emissions. The charge, introduced in 2010, will bring in £800million this year. Another three green taxes – on landfill and mining, and a European levy on carbon – have remained steady since 2010, costing firms £1.8billion a year. Gareth Stace, of the manufacturers' group EEF, said: 'These figures prove the point that we have been making for some time, namely that UK industry – especially energy-intensive companies – are paying a very heavy price. 'We urgently need to see competitiveness at the heart of energy and climate change policy to place us on a level playing field with even our European competitors who are not facing these bills, let alone the rest of the world. Failure to do this by the next government, if it continues to use carbon taxes as a revenue-raising tool, could only result in lost jobs and investment.' A Treasury spokesman said: 'This Government is committed to creating a tax system that is simple, fair and creates the right conditions... we have backed businesses with lower taxes overall, cutting corporation tax, giving employers up to £2,000 off their National Insurance bill and giving small high street businesses £1,000 off their business rates.'","The burden of green taxes on businesses has doubled under the Coalition .

"Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff faced the biggest challenge of her short but turbulent second term, as hundreds of thousands of protesters took to streets in more than 150 cities to demand her impeachment and an end to corruption. The Sunday protests, organised by right-leaning groups on social media and held across the country, had none of the violence seen in massive anti-government demonstrations that hit the country in 2013 and continued into the following year. They add to the mounting pressure on Rousseff, who is facing both political and economic crises. Brazil's economy has stalled, and dozens of top political figures are being quizzed as part of an investigation into in a 'kickback' scheme at state-run oil company Petrobras, which prosecutors believe may be the largest graft scheme yet uncovered in the country.

The biggest protest was seen in Sao Paulo, where some 210,000 people gathered on a main avenue, according to the polling and statistics firm Datafolha. Large gatherings were also seen in the capital Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and the southern city of Porto Alegre. Rousseff didn't appear in public, but government ministers held a nationally televised press conference in which they said they would introduce anti-corruption measures in Congress, action the president promised during her campaign for re-election in October. 'We are here to express our indignation with the government-sponsored corruption and thieving, and to demand Dilma's impeachment,' said Andre Menezes, 35, protesting on Avenida Paulista in Sao Paulo. 'She may have not been directly involved in the corruption at Petrobras, but she certainly knew about it, and for me that makes her just as guilty and justifies her ouster,' he added.

In Rio, police estimated 15,000 people marched along the golden sands of Copacabana beach, where they waved Brazilian flags and many openly called for a military coup to dissolve the government. In contrast to the widespread violence seen during Brazil's 2013 protests, on Sunday the only conflict reported was police using tear gas and stun grenades to disperse a small group of protesters in Brasilia who authorities said were trying to enter the Congress. In Sao Paulo, police arrested about 20 young men who were carrying powerful fireworks and brass knuckles. Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo defended the government, emphasizing Rousseff's record as a leftist guerrilla who stood up to Brazil's 1964-85 military regime — and who was jailed for three years and brutally tortured because of it. Rousseff has said she fully supports peaceful demonstrations and Cardozo added Sunday night that the rallies 'confirm that Brazil is a democratic state that allows for divergences, the existence of opposing opinions and that we're far from any coup option.' Much protester ire was focused on a kickback scheme at Petrobras, in which at least $800 million was paid in bribes and other funds by Brazil's biggest construction and engineering firms in exchange for inflated Petrobras contracts. Demonstrators march to demand the impeachment of  Rousseff in Sao Paulo . In contrast to the widespread violence seen during Brazil's 2013 protests, on Sunday the only conflict reported was police using tear gas and stun grenades to disperse a small group of protesters in Brasilia . Top executives are already in jail and the attorney general is investigating dozens of congressmen, along with current and former members of the executive branch, for alleged connections to the scheme that apparently began in 1997 before Rousseff's party took power in 2003. Rousseff, a former chairwoman of Petrobras' board, has not been implicated and so far is not being investigated, though top officials from her administration, including two former chiefs of staff, are caught up in the inquiry. The mass marches are another thorn in Rousseff's side, adding impetus to opposition efforts to thwart measures she backs in Congress. Brazilian growth has been weak since Rousseff took office in 2011. The country likely entered a recession in 2014 and most economists surveyed by the Central Bank forecast negative growth this year. Inflation is rising and the currency has plummeted against the dollar in recent weeks, making life more expensive in a nation with a surprisingly high cost of living. Still, Brazil's top opposition political figures say impeachment is undesirable, because the president isn't accused of any connection to the Petrobras scandal, and because it could affect Brazil's stability. Pedro Arruda, a political scientist at Sao Paulo's Pontifical Catholic University, said demonstrators have the right to demand Rousseff's ouster, 'but the impeachment they ... demand has no legal foot to stand on.' At Copacabana, protester Sheila Alcantara said she recently had to close a restaurant she owned because of rapidly rising prices for electricity and food.  'Never in my life have I heard of so much corruption, of so much money lost.'","President Dilma Rousseff faces the biggest challenge of her career .

"A new video shows the terrifying moment a film crew rushed to save the life of Oscar-winner William Hurt. The crew of the Gregg Allman biopic Midnight Rider can be seen dashing to get him off the tracks of a railroad bridge, along with their equipment, as he lay across the railway filming a scene in Georgia while a train rushes towards him and the crew at breakneck speed. The other actor in the scene, Wyatt Russell, can also be seen trying to scramble out of the train's path. Hurt and Russell somehow made it to safety. But,  several crew members  suffered injuries. Camera assistant Sarah Elizabeth Jones was tragically killed. She was just 27 years old. Scroll down for videos . A new video shows the terrifying moment a film crew rushed to save the life of Oscar winner William Hurt (above) from a train . The video shows the moment the cast and crew of the Greg Allman biopic Midnight Rider were forced to scramble as a train approached (above) The crew and actor Wyatt Russell (above with guitar) were filming a dream sequence on a railroad bridge . Camera assistant Sarah Jones (above) was struck by a fuel tank and run over by the train as she tried to flee and was killed instantly . The film's director Randall Miller (above with wife Jody Savin) pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and will serve two years in prison . The video also shows the crew desperately trying to get a bed off the track, which Hurt was laying on during the scene as they filmed a dream sequence while Russell played the guitar. Russell, the son of Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, can be seen clearly in the video as he flees with a guitar still on his back. Footage taken just before the tragic incident unfolded was later edited and cut into a scene. It would have been used in the film if production hadn't been stopped. Two weeks ago, the film's director, Randall Miller, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing and will serve two years in a county jail and eight years probation while also paying a $20,000 fine. Executive producer Jay Sedrish also pleaded guilty to the same charges and received 10 years probation. 'We hope the sacrifice of our daughter's life will continue to change the film industry,' Jones' father, Richard Jones, told reporters outside the courthouse. 'I believe it sends a message, frankly, that if you do not respect those you're in charge of, you may end up behind bars.' In addition, Hillary Schwartz, an assistant director on the film, was also convicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing and also received 10 years probation. Charges against Miller's wife and business partner, Jody Savin, were dropped as part of his plea. Prosecutors said all three defendants knew that CSX Transportation, which owned the trestle spanning the Altamaha River, had denied them permission in writing to film on its tracks. 'It was a horrible tragedy that will haunt me forever,' Miller said in a statement provided by a publicist. 'Although I relied on my team, it is ultimately my responsibility and was my decision to shoot the scripted scene that caused this tragedy.' Hurt (above) won the Best Actor Oscar in 1986 for Kiss of the Spider Woman . Assistant District Attorney John B. Johnson said Miller and the other filmmakers even attempted to rewrite the script to drop the scene they planned to shoot with actor William Hurt, in the role of Allman, in a hospital bed placed on the tracks. Miller decided to shoot the scene anyway, Johnson said, after the owner of the property surrounding the tracks said the movie crew could access its land. He said Miller and his crew went onto the railroad bridge after mistakenly thinking no more trains would pass that day. The train, traveling at 55mph, smashed into a metal-framed bed on the tracks, sending shrapnel flying as crew members scrambled for safety and clung to the bridge's metal railing high above the Altamaha River. After his plea was accepted, Miller followed a sheriff's deputy from the courtroom to begin his two-year sentence at the Wayne County jail. He also agreed to serve an additional eight years on probation and pay a $20,000 fine. Miller's attorney, Ed Garland, said he expects the director could be released from jail within a year. He said Miller accepted the plea deal to prevent prosecution of his wife, who left the courthouse in tears. Garland said the filmmaker never intended to put his crew at risk. The crew was filming a dream sequence that featured Hurt, as Allman, on a bed (above) Russell (above) was playing a guitar in the scene, and can be seen carrying it still as he ran from the train . 'We hope the sacrifice of our daughter's life will continue to change the film industry,' Jones' father, Richard Jones (above), told reporters on Monday . The incident occurred on February 20, 2014, the very first day of filming on the picture. Jones was first struck by a fuel tank and then fell on the tracks, being run over by the train seconds later. Miller recalled the moment he was forced to call her parents and deliver the heartbreaking news that their daughter was dead. Filming was immediately suspended, and many in the industry began a push for better safety regulations in the aftermath of the tragedy. A group called Slates for Sarah also began putting the words RIP Sarah Jones on film slates in her memory on programs including Girls, Scandal, Parks and Recreation, The Leftovers, Parenthood, Glee, The Mindy Project, Revenge and The Vampire Diaries, a show on which Jones had previously worked as an assistant.","A new video shows the moment the cast and crew of the Gregg Allman biopic Midnight Rider were forced to scramble as a train approached .

"Two newly-wed brothers in Pakistan are spending their first weeks of married life behind bars after police arrested them on terrorism charges for letting off firecrackers during their joint wedding ceremony. Officers in Karachi said the grooms went 'too far' during the celebrations, and have charged the brothers and three other people under the explosive provisions of anti-terrorism legislation. If found guilty they could face long prison sentences, or even the death penalty. The brothers set off firecrackers, like the ones pictured, during their wedding ceremony in Karachi, Pakistan, but now face spending their married life behind bars after being charged with terrorism offences . Setting off fireworks and firing weapons into the air is a longstanding custom at Pakistani weddings, but police officer Abbas Golarchi said the wedding party's celebrations scared the community living nearby. He told agency AFP: 'Very powerful crackers were being used during the marriage ceremony creating fear among the neighbourhood, a densely populated area of the city.' The five arrested are in police custody awaiting a remand hearing which is due to take place on Wednesday. A sentence of the death penalty is unlikely, it is thought, before no-one was harmed during the joint wedding celebration. It is customary at Pakistani weddings to set off firecrackers and fireworks, and human rights campaigners have accused the police and judiciary of using anti-terrorism legislation in cases not related to militancy . Human rights campaigners say Pakistan's anti-terrorism legislation and anti-terrorism courts are frequently misused to prosecute cases that have nothing to do with militancy. In their World Report 2015, Human Rights Watch criticised the passing of the Protection of Pakistan Act by the country's government, denouncing it as 'overly broad' counter-terrorism legislation that violates international human rights standards and allows security forces to act without accountability. More generally, Pakistani police are often criticised for their heavy-handed approach. In April last year, police in the eastern city of Lahore booked a nine-month-old boy on an attempted murder charge after his family members allegedly threw bricks at officers trying to collect an unpaid bill. At least 40 people were killed in 2005 after firecrackers exploded on a bus carrying wedding guests back from a ceremony in Lahore, eastern Pakistan, according to a BBC report.","The newly-wed siblings went 'too far' at their joint ceremony, say police .

"The White House committed today to a 'firm' deadline of Tuesday for Iran to make a permanent pact with a group of international negotiators not to build up it nuclear capabilities. 'We’ve been clear that the end of March is a firm deadline, and that’s simply because these negotiations have taken place over the course of more than a year,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Friday afternoon. 'That should be ample opportunity for us to reach an agreement.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, center, lit, talks with members of his delegation after a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and other officials at the Beau Rivage Palace Hotel on Friday. Major powers and Iran were pushing each other for concessions ahead of an end-March deadline for a preliminary nuclear deal, with Tehran demanding an immediate end to sanctions and freedom to continue sensitive atomic research, officials said .

The timetable for the details of the agreement to be set in stone continues to be the end of June. 'But where we need to start, is the outlines of a political agreement,' he said, which 'is something we are aiming to achieve by the end of March.' U.S. officials and their foreign counterparts in the P5 +1 group - the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council along with Germany - were in Switzerland on Friday with Iran's negotiators making a desperate last ditch bid to secure a landmark agreement - 13 years since the country's nuclear program became public. Britain's Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said earlier this week an agreement was 'deliverable' but urged Iran to make 'tough decisions' ahead of the meeting in Lausanne, on the shores of Lake Geneva. Along with five world powers, Britain is seeking a deal that would allow Iran to continue its Uranium enrichment program while reducing the likelihood of it gaining nuclear weapons. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters staking out the talks that he didn't have a strong sense if an acceptable agreement could be made in the next several days. 'The negotiations are difficult and complicated and there . are highs and lows,' Zarif said, according to Reuters. 'We think an agreement is still . possible but when is another story. Our feeling is that we . certainly will be able to reach an agreement, but that will need . political will on the other side.' The White House said Friday that it continued to believe the coalition had a 50 percent chance of convincing Iran to make the required concessions by the last day of the month, Tuesday, March 31. 'It’s still at best 50-50,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday. 'That’s the odds that I have previously given to the likelihood of an agreement being reached before the deadline, and those odds have not changed.' Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, left, talks with the head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization Ali Akbar Salehi after Friday's meeting. An Iranian official told Reuters that lingering issues with the international coalition, which includes, China, Russia and France in addition to Germany, Britain and the U.S., were over research and development and U.N. sanctions . Still 'fluid' next week is Obama's schedule. The White House declined to give reporters a preview on Friday, as is generally expected, of the president's plans beyond a Monday trip to Boston, Massachusetts, leaving him open to take on a more direct role in negotiations. The president has been receiving regular and at least 'daily' updates on the situation, his spokesman said Friday. After the afternoon briefing the White House sent reporters a notice that Obama had called German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the state of negotiations. The statement said the two world leaders agreed that 'Iran must make decisions necessary to resolve several remaining issues.' It did not provide details on what those deal-breaking matters were. An Iranian official told Reuters, however, that lingering issues with the coalition, which includes, China, Russia and France in addition to Germany, Britain and the U.S., were over research and development and U.N. sanctions. Iran reportedly wants an immediate draw down of sanctions, which the U.S. and its partners have said is a deal-breaker. The White House reiterated on Friday that only after it verified, over time, that Iran was keeping up its end of the pact would it ask Congress to ease sanctions on the country. Another Iranian negotiator told AFP on Friday that as far as his country is concerned, 'It all depends on the willingness of the other side. All the solutions are on the table.' 'We have already done what we need to do,' he stated. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reached out directly to the leaders of France, Russia, Britain and China on Thursday in an attempt to break the stalemate and passed on letters to all six members of the international coalition, including President Obama. Elsewhere, the hawkish French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has warned against a soft deal during negotiations. 'Tough decisions': This map helps demonstrate how Iran's nuclear program is spread across the country . Britain's Hammond warned failure to achieve a deal over Iran's nuclear program could trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Iran's nuclear program became public in 2002 when an opposition group revealed secret activity including construction of an uranium enrichment plant and a heavy-water reactor. Enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, while spent fuel from a heavy-water reactor contains plutonium suitable for a bomb. Following that, Iran agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But the IAEA could not confirm whether it had tried to  develop nuclear weapons. This led the P5+1 to press Iran to stop enriching uranium. Talks failed and in 2005 the IAEA referred Iran to the UN Security Council for failing to comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Since then, the Security Council has adopted six resolutions requiring Iran to stop enriching uranium, some imposing sanctions. In 2012, the US and EU began imposing additional sanctions on Iranian oil exports and banks, putting pressure on Iran to negotiate. Tehran insists its program is for civil nuclear power, but the international community has imposed sanctions amid concerns Iran harbors ambitions to create nuclear weapons. In a speech in London, Hammond said he was clear that 'no deal is better than a bad deal' if talks in Switzerland break down this weekend. 'But we should also be clear-eyed about the alternative,' he said. 'No deal means no restrictions on enrichment, no restrictions on research and development, and no independent monitoring or verification. It means a fundamentally more unstable Middle East, with the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the region.' He added: 'So now is the time, with our key allies, to build on the recent momentum, to press Iran where differences remain, and to strain every sinew to get a deal over the finishing line. The door to a nuclear deal is open, but Iran must now step through it.' Iran and the P5+1 agreed an interim accord in November 2013 that saw it cut down on sensitive nuclear activities in return for temporary relief from sanctions that have crippled its economy. A deadline of July 2014 was set to find a 'comprehensive solution', but the talks were subsequently extended by four months to give negotiators more time. Despite 'significant progress' being made, both sides agreed in November that another seven months were needed. Diplomats now hope to reach a rough deal this weekend with all-important technical details decided by June 30.","'We’ve been clear that the end of March is a firm deadline, and that’s simply because these negotiations have taken place over the course of more than a year,' White House spokesman said Friday .

"The lone holdout juror in the Jodi Arias trial says she saved the killer's life because she had 'mental issues.' The Arizona woman known anonymously as Juror 17 says she sought to be as objective as possible in deciding Arias' fate and concluded 'because of her genetic makeup, she didn't have the capability of coping with her tumultuous relationship' with Travis Alexander. Juror 17 told KPNX that journal entries also swayed her. 'There were entries where she could be completely happy and positive in the morning and suicidal later on that day,' Juror 17 revealed. The 33-year-old mother insisted she does believe in the death penalty, just not in this instance. 'I actually do,' she said. 'I think it's necessary, but it's something that shouldn't be taken lightly and it should be a case by case.' Speaking out: The juror who single-handedly saved the life of Jodi Arias this month is speaking out in her own defense after receiving continued threats and ridicule . Mentally ill? Juror 17 has revealed she based her decision to save Jodi Arias's life on what she perceived to be the killer's lapses in mental clarity and her emotional instability . In this case, Juror 17 said the punishment was not warranted because Arias was not emotionally sound--despite the ruthless way she slashed Alexander's throat so deeply he was nearly beheaded. 'She wasn't insane, but there were months spent on showing her mental deterioration,' Juror 17 said of the Arias defense. 'I think she looked a little bit more human to me just by her journal writings.' Juror 17's decision has won her a barrage of social media lashings, ridicule and even death threats, she revealed yesterday. However, she maintains she indeed had Travis Alexander's family in the back of her mind while she decided. 'Travis' life mattered and I was asked to put my personal feelings aside and to just look at the evidence they presented. And to go with my honest belief,' Juror 17 said. However, 17 would not go so far to say that, had Alexander been her son, she would have wanted Arias dead. 'I don't know if I would,' she told KPNX. Juror 17 on Monday denied allegations she was some 'stealth juror' intent on saving the infamous murderer's life--one of many allegations made against her by social media supporters of Alexander's family. She will live: The latest Arias trial became the second to end in a jury deadlock. This one means the killer may not be handed the death penalty . Juror 17 also addressed her past encounters with Arias prosecutor Juan Martinez, facts that would not be revealed until after the March 5 deadlock announcement. 'It wasn't easy, I didn't ask for it, I didn't want it,' she said. 'All I did was answer the questions truthfully. I didn't want to be involved. I didn't want this pressure.' Mostly, those questions revolved around what Juror 17 knew about the case going in, which, she insists, was very little. 'I live in Arizona so I had heard about the case and I had seen just when they would come up on the news,' she told KPNX. 'I would hear people talk about it and it wasn't something I really wanted to get sucked in to.' When she arrived to the courthouse, Juror 17 recalls that there were many cases she could have been called to. In now way, she says, could she have manipulated it so she would. However, her detractors point to her previous connection to Juan Martinez as proof Juror 17 wanted to be in the Arias trial and wanted Martinez to lose. Fifteen years ago, Juror 17's then husband was tried and convicted for robbery by Martinez and then sent to jail. Juror 17 says she only recognized Martinez from television. Besides, she loathed her ex-husband and had been open about his abuse when question during jury selection. 'My struggles and my frustrations were always directed towards him,' she told KPNX. 'It's preposterous to me to hold a grudge or to blame somebody for doing their job.' Nonetheless, the conspiracy theorizing and social media vexation raged on. Grudge? Juror 17 says she was simply fulfilling he civic duty by showing up for jury service in October. However, her critics accuse the 33-year-old of having it out for prosecutor Juan Martinez (center) for his having put her then-husband away for robbery 15 years ago . Meanwhile, it was revealed March 10 that jurors had questioned the holdout's objectivity because she had previously watched a Lifetime movie about the Arias case, and prosecutors were upset at the juror's social media activity as she went on Facebook and liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network. The juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted Arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend Travis Alexander nearly seven years ago. 'My opinion isn't being heard,' the judge quoted the holdout as saying. The holdout's identity was leaked through a Twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about Alexander, while a pro-Arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence Arias to death for the 2008 killing. Outrage: Social media critics have lashed out at Juror 17 with claims she was a 'stealth juror' out to save Arias, that she had it in for the prosecutor and with threats to her and her family . Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial . 'Not recognizing Juan Martinez is like saying you don't recognize Mickey at Disney,' tweeted @Kristyannasmom. '@katiecoolady wrote: 'bad enough my tax dollar$ went to a victim trashing defense, now to see a $tealth #juror17 entered the trial, enough is enough #jodiarias' '#juror17...your lies and deception caused so much pain and heartache that can never be taken back!!!' wrote @tarakelley320. 'Juror safety and the protection of jurors' personal and confidential information are topics the Court takes very seriously,' the Maricopa County Superior Court said in a statement. Dwane Cates, a criminal defense attorney in Phoenix who isn't involved in the Arias case, said the leaks won't change the outcome of the case, noting that mistrial decisions can't be appealed. Arias was convicted of murder in Alexander's death at a 2013 trial that became a global sensation with its revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. A new jury was picked to decide her punishment after the first jury deadlocked on that question. Lifetime movie: Juror 17 admitted to seeing the Lifetime film about the case (above) in 'bits and pieces' while being screened for her service. Her fellow jurors would later use this to try to get her removed from the jury . A mistrial was declared after five days of deliberations, removing the death penalty as a possible punishment for Arias. The judge is scheduled to decide on April 13 whether Arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years. Most of the jurors said last week that they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty. Judge Sherry Stephens had individually questioned some of the jurors, including the holdout, who said she wasn't socializing at lunch with other jurors in an effort to be impartial. Stephens said the holdout had disclosed, before being picked as a juror, that she had seen the Lifetime movie about the Arias case, but never watched it all the way through. The judge said the holdout juror didn't commit misconduct because she clearly disclosed that she had seen the movie. The judge also refused a request by prosecutors to remove the holdout from the jury because she had liked on her Facebook page another film that Arias found influential. And the case's chief investigator said the holdout, who had claimed she had recently been keeping away from Facebook, had liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network.

"Police in Dallas are hunting two people linked to the death of a woman who apparently had a botched cosmetic procedure carried out on her buttocks and another who had holes caused by butt injections patched up with superglue. The suspects, named as Denise Rochelle ‘Wee Wee’ Ross and a transgender person called Jimmy Joe Clarke, also known as Alicia, are wanted for practicing medicine without a licence. Wykesha Reid, 34, was found dead on a massage table inside a business that performs eyelash extensions on February 19, with her pants partially pulled down and a blood-stained gauze on her butt. Suspects: Dallas police are hunting Denise Rochelle 'Wee Wee' Ross (left) and Jimmy Joe Clarke - also known as 'Alicia' - (right) who are linked to botched butt injections carried out on two women, one of whom died . The body was found by Clarke and police believe the victim suffered a medical emergency while having injections in her buttocks. Mrs Reid’s daughter, Keira, told police that her mother had booked a session to have ‘butt injections’ and that a woman who goes by the name of ‘Wee Wee’ and a transgender person were going to carry out the procedure. Police were also told by another witness whose boyfriend rents the business, in the 3800 block of East Side Avenue, that a person called Wee Wee and Clarke used it to perform butt injections, according to Wfaa.com. This witness works at the premises performing eyelash extensions and claims that Ross and Clarke arrived on the evening of February 19 and told her and the client she was with to leave. She also told police that Ross later urged her ‘not to break’ and lie about the fact she uses the premises. Clarke told police that she had no idea how Reid had died. The Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office reported that it found injection marks and a silicone-type substance on the buttocks of Wykesha Reid, 34 . She claims that she arrived at the business on February 18 complaining that she ‘was not well and wanted to lay down’, so she locked her in the building overnight and discovered her body when she returned in the morning. The Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office reported that it found injection marks and a silicone-type substance on the buttocks of Mrs Reid. The death follows a complaint to police by a 27-year-old woman who said that she visited 3800 block of East Side on February 9 and paid $520 to have buttock injections, but ended up screaming in agony when ‘unknown’ substances were used on her. The holes were then closed with superglue, she said. She later identified Ross and Clarke as the people who carried out the operation. The suspects' whereabouts are currently unknown. Neither are registered with the Texas Medical Board.","Denise Rochelle 'Wee Wee' Ross is being hunted by Dallas Police .

"The man accused of murdering Morgan Huxley says he had a consensual sexual encounter with him before an intruder hit him over the head, knocking him sideways. Daniel Jack Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Mr Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore.

Daniel Jack Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday . He said Mr Huxley was smiling during the friendly chat but became more serious as he started talking about how he had had a 'stressful week'. 'He said he had some problems with work,' Kelsall said. 'I said something like, ""Do you want to talk about it?"". 'He seemed a little hesitant about it and then he said, ""Yeah, I could do with someone to talk to"".' Mr Huxley then invited him to his apartment, Kelsall told the jury. Jessica Hall (middle) - the ex-girlfriend of Morgan Huxley - gave evidence at Daniel Jack Kelsall's murder trial in Sydney last week . Rebecca Prins, who was dating Morgan Huxley in the months before his death, is pictured leaving the NSW Supreme Court after giving evidence . After talking for a while about Mr Huxley's work, which 'wasn't going so well', Kelsall said he asked the 31-year-old ""Do you want to do things with me?"" The pair then went upstairs to Mr Huxley's room. 'He (Mr Huxley) came in after me and turned off the lights and he immediately dropped his pants.' With his shoes still on, Kelsall said Mr Huxley lay down on his bed. Kelsall told the court he sat between Mr Huxley's legs and began fondling his penis. 'Then something hit me in the side of the head. It really hurt,' Kelsall said.

'I kind of looked up and there was another person in the room. I got up and ran. 'I knew there was at least one (person there). It could have been more.' He told the court he didn't tell police because he was afraid of having anything to do with the murder. 'I want to make amends and tell the truth for a terrible lie I have told and I want them (the jury) to understand my side of the story,' Kelsall said. The trial continues.

"Every MP in the country is to get a brand new iPad after the general election, costing the tax payer £1million. The House of Commons Commission claimed that offering all 650 ministers a new laptop or iPad Air 2, would actually save money. Liberal Democrat John Thurso, who represents the commission in the chamber, said moving away from Apple's products would be too expensive. Caught in the act: Tory MP Nigel Mills was caught playing Candy Crush on his taxpayer-funded iPad last December . But Shadow Cabinet Office minister Chi Onwurah criticised the decision to lock MPs into the Apple operating system and told Computerworld UK she would have preferred a 'device agnostic' policy. 'As we saw with Nigel Mills and Candy Crush, MPs will be using the games, and the iTunes and other features on the iPad,' she added. 'Locking some of the most powerful people in the country into a platform that most of my constituents can't afford seems like a mistake. And that's without mentioning the tax avoidance issue. I'm pushing for a device independent digital platform for Parliament.' Liberal Democrat John Thurso claimed a move away from Apple's operating system would  incur more costs . Apple iPads have been used across Parliament since a pilot scheme was launched in 2012. Currently 209 MPs have taxpayer-funded tablets with the understanding they use them for working while on the move in Parliament. But last December a Tory MP was caught playing a game on his iPad for more than two hours during a meeting. Nigel Mills escaped punishment after he admitted having a ‘game or two’ of Candy Crush and promised not to do it again. Mr Mills, the MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, was supposed to be listening to experts give evidence at a meeting of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee. He had initially said he would merely ‘try’ not to be diverted by the game again, but yesterday afternoon in a statement he said: ‘I guarantee it will not happen again. In 2013, the House of Commons Commission agreed to a recommendation from the administration committee that 'a tablet and a laptop should be the first pieces of equipment offered to all members after the 2015 election'. The Commission assessed a range of tablets with prices ranging from £100 to £600 and where they decided on the Apple iPad Air 2. The cost of supplying the new iPads would be £200,000 a year over the life of the next Parliament. Mr Thurso said the decision to buy the new gadgets was to avoid spending more money on training staff to use non-Apple systems and to reduce hard copy printing in favour of online publication which was already saving more than £3 million annually. The House of Commons Commission said that buying the 650 MPs an iPad Air 2 each, worth £499, will save money . 'Having been in use across Parliament since 2012, iPads are integrated with current business processes and infrastructure,' he said. 'A move away from the Apple operating system (iOS) at this time would incur costs to change these processes. 'Members are able to access the intranet and intranet hosted services via their iPads, they are able to access and annotate committee papers and can download a number of Office apps to access any content held within Office 365. 'There would be a significant change to move existing members to a different tablet operating system. Any departure from iOS would require re-training for the current members using iOS and new training to be developed for the remaining 441 members and all relevant PICT support staff.'","Every MP in the country is to be offered a brand new iPad worth £499 each .

"The costly legal standoff over Julian Assange took a dramatic turn yesterday when Swedish prosecutors said they were prepared to question the WikiLeaks founder in Britain. For almost three years Assange, pictured, has been claiming asylum in London’s Ecuadorian embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden over rape allegations. The 43-year-old faces arrest if he steps outside, and taxpayers have spent more than £10million on police who monitor him 24 hours a day. Swedish Prosecutors have offered to travel to London to question Wikileaks founder Julian Assange . Swedish officials until now refused to question him in London over the allegations of rape, sexual assault and illegal coercion. But yesterday lead prosecutor Marianne Ny announced that they will now travel to Britain – because time is running out. Under Swedish law they only have until August to pursue the claims relating to sexual assault and illegal coercion. Miss Ny said that an interview conducted at the embassy would be of lower ‘quality’, but added: ‘Now that time is of the essence, I have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies.’ Her team will also seek a DNA swab. Assange, who is currently holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy, is wanted for questioning in Sweden over sexual assault allegations . Today one of the Australian's lawyers welcomed the offer by Swedish prosecutors to travel to the UK and said it was likely their offer would be accepted. 'This is something we've demanded for over four years,' said Per Samuelson. 'Julian Assange wants to be interviewed so he can be exonerated. So of course we welcome this.' However, Assange may stay in the embassy for another five years until the more serious allegation of rape also expires in Swedish law. By then the bill for Scotland Yard’s sentry duty would be around £30million. Assange’s spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson has repeatedly said that the activist – who denies the accusations – has no intention of turning himself in. Yesterday, Mr Hrafnsson called the offer by Swedish prosecutors ‘a victory for Julian’, but insisted the delay had been ‘absolutely outrageous’. He said: 'I assume this is because it is extremely likely that Julian will win a case in the Supreme Court in Sweden, determining that the arrest warrant be dropped. Assange's lawyers welcome the move by the Swedish prosecutors to travel to London to quiz him . The surveillance operation outside the Ecuadorian Embassy has so far cost the UK taxpayers £10million . 'The court has recently announced it will hear the case, and it is quite obvious it will rule in Julian's favour.' Mr Hrafnsson said the Swedish prosecutor had 'done nothing' to move the case forward for years. Assange has been fighting extradition to Sweden since it issued a warrant for his arrest in August 2010. Two years later he was granted political asylum by Ecuador. He believes that if he goes to Sweden, he will be extradited to the US and questioned over classified state documents that were published by WikiLeaks. Last month Stephen Greenhalgh, London deputy mayor for policing, said the cost of guarding the embassy was ‘eye-watering’. Police have been station outside the embassy building in Knightsbridge round the clock since Assange arrived in June 2012. He has been granted asylum by the government of Ecuador but cannot travel there because he will be arrested first. In that time he has given a series of speeches from the balcony of the building and 'attended' conferences around the world by video message.","Swedish prosecutors offer to come to London to question Julian Assange .

"Thousands of angry customers who bought healthy living app The Whole Pantry are demanding their money back after finding out founder Belle Gibson's cancer story could be false. Ms Gibson, 23, is in the spotlight this week after doubts were raised about her remarkable cancer survival story - and the book, Apple Watch app and website that it inspired. Taking to The Whole Pantry's Facebook page, some of the 300,000 people who downloaded the app have called for their money to be refunded and have slammed the mother-of-one for misleading her followers. Young mum: Close friends told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday that Ms Gibson may have departed Australia for the United States this week . 'Lies, Lies and more Lies. I demand a refund,' one unhappy customer said. 'What kind of person fakes illnesses for attention. She has mental health issues and needs help. It scares me to think how many people have died following her natural therapy cancer treatment diet/lifestyle. Disgusting,' another Facebook commenter said. Many others called for the entrepreneur to face up to her lies and do the right thing. Questions have also been raised about her donations to charity. Ms Gibson shot to stardom on social media and gave hope to cancer sufferers worldwide after she revealed that she had prolonged her life despite shunning conventional medical treatment and relying on her own 'whole life' concept. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) is also a popular app, which costs $3.79 to download. The app is slated to appear on the new Apple Watch . She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. It has been reported that Ms Gibson has met with lawyers to fight the claims. School friends of under-fire Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson now query whether the health guru invented stories 'to get sympathy' and warned people against vaccination while she was in high school. Ms Gibson attended Wynnum State High School in Brisbane and former classmates describe the health guru as a 'drama queen' who constantly reinvented herself and backed medical cannabis. Former school friend Chris Green said Ms Gibson was 'a drama queen. There was always something going on with her.' 'At one stage she was an emo, then a skater girl then she was a surfer chick; she was always something different,' Mr Green told The Courier Mail. Mr Green also said that Ms Gibson never mentioned an autistic brother or a mother with multiple sclerosis, who she had previously claimed to be a carer for. One anonymous school friend said that Ms Gibson would often post information advocating against vaccinations and pushed the viewpoint quite hard. Former classmate Meg Weier said that Ms Gibson was quite strange. Doting mother: Ms Gibson, pictured left with her son Olivier, and right with another friend, founded the popular app and cookbook Whole Pantry . Young mother: Ms Gibson, the mother of Olivier (pictured) has established a successful business in Whole Pantry . Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . Friends close to the mum-of-one have said that she may have gone overseas to avoid confronting claims that her remarkable cancer survival story is not all it seems. Another former friend of Ms Gibson has called on her to 'come clean' on her 'misdiagnosis'. Mother-of-two Jayne Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims in various media stories this week, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. The Whole Pantry, a popular app, gained media attention because of Ms Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival . The company she founded, The Whole Pantry, said donations to charities that allegedly failed to arrive had been 'accounted for and not processed' and that promised donations 'would be honoured'. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia she was 'baffled' by this week's allegations and was most upset about the hope Ms Gibson's followers had invested in her program if she was being dishonest. She said Ms Gibson had the 'gift of the gab' and 'needs to answer to these people (her followers), because they are good hearted people who deserve answers'. 'I don't care about exposing Belle. I haven't spoken to her for months, years. 'I just want her to confirm or deny (her diagnoses) so people who put their faith in her, invested in her - they need to know. 'They need to know, if they've rejected conventional medicine on what she's saying. 'It's their lives, it's not a game.' Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want' After three years of sometimes personal exchanges online, Ms Gibson and Ms Smith stopped talking after the development of the Whole Pantry app. 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want. 'I don't want to see her beg people for mercy. I don't want her to beg for forgiveness - I just want the truth. 'Come clean, be transparent, let the world know where you're at. If you were misdiagnosed, own up to it. 'Belle DID create an exceptional application, that is loved by many, but I think she should sell it for what it is, complimentary medicines and a diet - not life saving treatment. 'All people want is the truth from her.' Close friends told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday that Ms Gibson may have left for the United States. Police visited her home on Tuesday night to check on her welfare, but she was not there. Multiple calls to Ms Gibson's mobile rang out. Amid claims that the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry app has fled to country, more details about Belle Gibson's past are coming to light. The young social media personality - who came under fire after claims her 'terminal cancer' and incredible survival story from the life-threatening illness were false - once described herself as a psychopath.

"The home of Manchester United star Angel Di Maria has been put up for sale just weeks after he suffered a terrifying raid while eating dinner with his family inside. Burglars used scaffolding poles to smash their way in to his home through patio doors while the Argentina winger, his wife Jorgelina and one-year-old daughter Mia were at the Cheshire mansion. Now the sprawling home, which Di Maria rents from a private landlord, has been put on the market for £4.1million amid reports that his wife is too scared to return to the property.

Burglars are believed to have used scaffolding poles to smash their way in to his home through patio doors while the Argentina winger, his wife Jorgelina and one-year-old daughter Mia were at the Cheshire mansion . The mansion, which is set in manicured grounds in Prestbury, Cheshire, is now on the market for £4.1million . Di Maria and his family reportedly moved into a luxury hotel after the incident with round-the-clock security keeping them safe. They now look set to move away for good, with the luxury mansion up for sale. It has also been suggested that a recent drop in form can be attributed to the break-in. The Daily Mail's Martin Samuel writes: 'Searching for clues to the recent decline of Angel di Maria, the break-in that occurred at his house in January cannot be overlooked. Di Maria’s form had dropped off before that, true, but not as alarmingly as it has in recent weeks. 'He wasn’t getting hooked at half-time before this event. 'Alvaro Negredo suffered a similarly shattering blow that ended his family’s love for their new country. He was not the same player after it happened. Di Maria is believed to be relocating his family to a new, high-level apartment following their traumatic experience.'

But his future at United remains uncertain, with rumours rife about a return abroad. According to reports, he could be offered an escape route out of Old Trafford by Paris Saint-Germain. Di Maria, however, has maintained he is happy at United. Di Maria's daughter Mia was born three months premature on April 22, 2013 - the night before her father's then team Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in a Champions League semi-final. He missed the game to be with his wife and their baby spent the next two months in intensive care before the couple were allowed to take her home. The footballer has previously said of his little girl: ‘My daughter taught me that everything that appears to be really difficult can end up being easy if you put the effort in and wait for the rewards. ‘She transmitted so much energy to me and it helped me to have the spectacular year that I had.’ Angel Di Maria and his wife Jorgelina.

"A mysterious object has been spotted flying through an Argentinian news broadcast, leading to claims of a UFO. The disc-shaped object was seen moving across a studio backdrop during a live broadcast in Buenos Aires last week. However, several outlets and experts are dismissing the claims of a UFO, pointing out several errors in the short clip. 'Mysterious object': The disc-shaped object can be spotted in the top-left corner of the background . The object was seen moving across what is purported to be a large widow during a studio broadcast from Todo Noticias, aka TN, an Argentinian cable news channel. As the anchors discuss a topic on the daily agenda, a disc-shaped object is seen zooming across the skyline in the background. The 'UFO' was first reported by MysteriousUniverse.org, who writes that the broadcast took place on February 28th before it was posted on Youtube. Unfortunately for alien enthusiasts, there are several indications that the UFO is nothing but a hoax. Several anomalies in the short clip indicates that the background in the studio has been tampered with. UFO? The object zooms across the skyline in the background behind the broadcasters . Myth debunked: The Argentinian UFO has been dismissed as a fake by experts, who has pointed out several flaws in what they call an 'animation hoax' Pie in the sky: The disc-shaped UFO is now in the top left corner having 'flown' behind the skyscraper . 'This was most likely an animation hoax because of some common editing errors that appear to be present,' Ben Hansen, the former lead investigator of the Syfy Channel's 'Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files', told the Huffington Post. Raëlism, also known as Raelianism or the Raëlian movement, is a UFO religion that was founded in 1974. The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human and when having personal contacts with the descendants of the humans they made, they previously misinformed (on purpose) early humanity that they were angels, cherubim or gods. Raëlians believe messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha,Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. Hansen highlights two particular errors, one being proof that the UFO is superimposed on top of wires on an antenna mast at the 33-second mark, and the second that the UFO disappears before it supposedly flies behind a building. He also highlights that if the station really had captured a flying alien vessel, he believes they would have either mentioned it during the live broadcast or used it later for publicity. This comes just  a week after another alleged UFO spotting during a South American broadcast. The production crew in Lima, Peru, were filming a programme when they interrupted it in order to  focus on what appears to be a 'UFO' hovering over the city. The purple-colored disc-shaped object can be seen hovering in the  sky near a construction site, but so far, there has been no official explanation for the object. Thousands of people have taken to social media to discuss what they think the mysterious purple object is and the video has already been viewed more than 100,000 times.","'UFO' seen in flying over Buenos Aires skyline during news broadcast .

"Ex Chancellor Gerard Schroeder, who has a penchant for art, cashmere and cigars, has split from wife number four, it has been reported . Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who was once a figure of fun in the political world for his colourful personal life, has separated from wife number four. He has split from his wife of 18 years, Doris Köpf, and moved out of the family home into a separate apartment, it has been reported. Schroeder earned the nickname the 'Audi Chancellor' during his political career because he he has had as many wedding rings as the car maker's symbol. He wed Ms Kopf, a former journalist, in 1997 but has now left their home in the upmarket area of Hanover. Reports suggest the pair will continue to share parenting duties. They adopted two Russian children from orphanages in St Petersburg in July 2004 and 2006. The cigar smoking former Chancellor, who has also been dubbed the 'Lord of the Rings', has had a busy personal life. In 1968, he married his childhood sweetheart, librarian Eva Schubach, divorcing her three years later as his political career took hold. The following year he wed political activist and teacher Anne Taschenmacher. Schroeder married wife number three Hiltrud Hampel in 1984 - they had met at an SPD conference . He has split from his fourth wife of 18 years, Doris Köpf (pictured), and moved out of the family home . Doris Schroeder-Kopf, 51, a former journalist, was the latest wife of the man who is nicknamed the 'Audi Chancellor' because he has had as many wedding rings as the car maker's prestige symbol . Wife number three, in 1984, was Hiltrud Hampel, a socialite environmentalist. They became known as the Clintons of Saxony: Germany's first celebrity political couple who for 12 years wooed the German public with their various campaigns. While Schröder worked on his role as career politician, Hampel a devoted vegetarian, campaigned for animal rights. When he married Kopf, a pretty blonde 20 years his junior, in 1998, he warned her that he changed his wives every 12 years. 'In that case my successor will have to be able to push a wheelchair,' she is alleged to have quipped in response. The former Chancellor was pictured in a warm embrace with the controversial Russian President last year . Schroeder is a close friend of Putin and he has defended the Kremlin's actions in Ukraine .

Last year, Schroeder was snapped hugging Russian President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg as he celebrated his 70th birthday. Schroeder, who was German chancellor from 1998-2005, has long had close ties to Mr Putin and runs a pipeline venture bringing Russian gas to Germany. He also defended the Kremlin's aggressive actions in the Ukraine by claiming Russia wanted to stay 'big and strong' and an equal to the US. In the past, he has described the Russian President as a 'flawless democrat'. He joined the board of the Russian energy giant Gazprom after losing Germany's 2005 election as leader of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who are now in a coalition with Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).","Former Chancellor has split from his fourth wife of 18 years, Doris Kopf .

"Peter Abetz, a WA state government MLA, expanded on the remarks he made to a West Australian newspaper in an interview with Daily Mail Australia. Gay rights activist Rodney Croome said: 'Peter Abetz is reinforcing exactly the same myths and prejudices that the Safe Schools Program is designed to challenge' A former Christian pastor and politician described an anti-bullying campaign as a 'gay lifestyle promotion program', in remarks blasted by gay rights activists. Peter Abetz, a WA state government backbencher - who first spoke to The West Australian - said he was concerned the Safe Schools Coalition Australia program would elevate LGBTI children to 'celebrity' status. 'I don't believe that any program should go into a school which actually elevates a subset of students - LGBTI - to celebrity status and gives them special privileges which are not afforded to any other sub-group in the school,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Abetz said 'no one' should have to tolerate bullying but campaigns targeting gay, lesbian and transgender students could lead to more bullying in schools overall. He said being gay was 'not normal' - as heterosexuals make up '90 to 95 per cent of the population on a 'distribution curve' and just as 'skinny' or 'obese' people are not the majority. 'Just because it's not the norm in the population doesn't mean they shouldn't be respected and treated with dignity,' he said. Prominent gay rights advocate and Tasmanian of the Year Rodney Croome  blasted Mr Abetz's remarks. 'Peter Abetz is reinforcing exactly the same myths, prejudices that the Safe Schools Program is designed to challenge,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Homophobia and transphobia will not be tolerated. K Thanks': This poster is one of several produced by the Safe Schools Coalition Australia in association with other organisations . This poster here is among several downloadable from the Safe Schools Coalition Australia's website . 'A decade of large-scale studies in Australia and overseas have confirmed that prejudice and bullying against young gay people increases their risk of alcohol and drug abuse, conflict with peers, early school leaving, and suicide.' 'The research also shows that one of the best ways to address this risk is to give teachers the skills and information they need to effectively challenge classroom prejudice and bullying.' The Safe Schools Coalition Australia program, which received a four-year, $8m grant from the Federal government, supports 'gender diversity, intersex and sexual diversity' in Australian schools. The program will be implemented in Western Australia from the middle of this year. Sally Richardson, the program's national director, said in a statement: 'Since the program's official launch last June we have had a lot of interest and support from WA schools, young people and community organisations. 'We are looking forward to supporting WA schools to be safer and more supportive for LGBTI young people, teachers and families. 'All students have the right to feel safe at school - only then can they achieve their very best. Everyone wants that.' Mr Abetz said the Safe Schools Coalition Australia (which produces posters such as those above) program would elevate gay, lesbian, transgender, intersex and bisexual children to 'celebrities' at school .","Former Christian pastor Peter Abetz has described a school anti-bullying campaign as a 'gay lifestyle promotion campaign'

"At least three top Hillary Clinton aides used email addresses hosted on the former secretary of state's private server while she was in office, according to reports from two different news outlets. A conservative magazine reported Wednesday that Clinton's State Department chief and deputy chief of staff both had the private addresses. 'Two of Hillary Clinton's top aides used personal email while they were employed at the State Department,' Weekly Standard senior writer Stephen Hayes said in a Fox News Channel interview, naming 'Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton's chief of staff.' 'The State Department has evidence of this,' Hayes claimed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Abedin (left), shown with then-Secretary of State Clinton during a 2010 diplomatic meeting in Vietnam, was her deputy chief of staff and is expected to play a key roll if Clinton runs for president . The Weekly Standard's Stephen Hayes claimed on Fox News that the State Department has evidence Abedin and Cheryl Mills, Clinton's two top aides, both used private email addresses for government work . Clinton has come under fire for exclusively using her own 'clintonemail.com' address while she was America's top diplomat. She admitted Tuesday during a news conference at the United Nations that she deleted more than 30,000 emails she decided were personal in nature and unrelated to her job. Separately from claims by The Weekly Standard, the gossip website Gawker reported this month that Abedin and Phillippe Reines, Clinton's top communications strategist, had the private addresses. Abedin married into a separate scandal when she wed former congressman Anthony Weiner, whose sexting exploits landed him on front pages and hastened his departure from Congress. Daily Mail Online was able to confirm Abedin's email address through Lexis-Nexis, a commercial service that compiles public records. 'Huma@clintonemail.com' was one of several of Abedin's email addresses Nexis collected in conjunction with other public records. Email addresses typically land in the Nexis database when people list them on credit applications, mortgage paperwork or other legal documents. Cheryl Mills (left) was Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department and reportedly used an off-the-books email address to trade messages with the then-secretary of state, potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators . Searches for similar email addresses belonging to Reines and Mills were unsuccessful, as were searches for email addresses belonging to current and former State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, Jen Psaki and Marie Harf, along with current Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill. Merrill told Gawker this month that Reines 'has never had' an email address on the private Clinton server, 'not for communicating with anyone about anything.' But Merrill wouldn't say whether Reines used a separate private account to conduct government business with Clinton. Hayes said Tuesday that 'the question, I think becomes: Were they emailing with Hillary Clinton from their personal email addresses to her personal email address about State Department business, about Benghazi, including sensitive classified information?' 'Those are questions that I think that Trey Gowdy and the House Benghazi Committee is going to want to look at very carefully.' Rep. Gowdy is a former South Carolina prosecutor now in charge of a congressional inquest into the deaths of three Americans during a 2012 terror attack on a diplomatic station in Benghazi, Libya. Clinton acknowledged Tuesday that she deleted more than 30,000 'personal' emails but insisted she first gave everything work-related to the State Department for inspection . Her first public words about 'email-gate' attracted a crush of reporters at the United Nations . Clinton's State Department was criticized in the attack's aftermath for interfering with CIA talking points which originally made it clear a specific Islamic militant group, Ansar-al-Shariah, was responsible for the bloodshed, which claimed the lives of two security personnel and Ambassador Chris Stevens. At the time, the White House and Clinton personally maintained that a spontaneous protest over a crude anti-Muslim Internet video had spiraled out of control, sparking a riot. Now congressional Republicans want to know if all of Clinton's work-related emails, hosted not on a secure government computer but on a server she personally kept at her Chappaqua, New York home, have been archived as federal law requires. Clinton claimed Tuesday during a contentious press conference, her first on the subject, that when she exchanged emails with staff members who did use official 'state.gov' email addresses, the government archived the messages from the recipients' end of the conversations. But if staffers were using 'clintonemail.com' addresses for sensitive work, including messages about the Benghazi attack, the State Department would have no record of them and Gowdy's efforts to demand them could be meaningless. 'This is the key point,' Hayes said Wednesday. 'Yesterday, she said, ""Look, when I was doing State Department business I was emailing to people who on the receiving end of her emails had .gov email addresses and therefore the emails, the documents would have been retained"",' Hayes recounted. 'What this suggests is that others were using non-.gov emails, their personal emails, and if they communicated with her in that manner those emails with her will be lost unless they're compelled to provide them.' It's unclear if the messages still exist, however. Clinton conceded Tuesday that she had deleted more than half of her own emails, but did not say if staffers and advisers who shared her server did the same. Longtime press aide Philippe Reines (left) insists that he did not have a private Clinton-linked email address, but Gawker reported otherwise . Gowdy seemed to agree with Hayes, saying Tuesday on CNN that emails sent to a '.gov' address 'would be captured by the .gov server.' 'But if you're talking to people private-to-private that will never be captured.' He said his committee would 'seek any private email that relates to official business, and I don't care about wedding cakes, but any work that could have been done on private-to-private accounts for those State Department employees we know had private accounts.' Earlier in the morning on MSNBC, Gowdy demanded that Clinton allow an outside arbiter to examine the email server to determine what deleted information might be salvaged and who was using it. 'I think it's eminently reasonable to ask someone to turn the server over to an independent, neutral third-party,' he said, 'not to the House of Representatives.' 'Turn it over to a retired judge, an archivist, an inspector general, so that we can have some assurance,' he said.","Weekly Standard says State Dept. has evidence Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, Clinton's top two aides at State, used 'clintonemail.com' addresses .

"Disgraced news anchor Brian Williams has shown his face in public for the first time after being yanked off of his slot on NBC's Nightly News. Williams, who was kicked off the show for lying about surviving an RPG attack in the Iraq war, was the guest of honor at a fundraiser for the private Catholic high school he attended as a boy. The shamed newsreader schmoozed with guests at a casino in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in the hope of scraping together $1million to prop up the Mater Dei Catholic prep school in nearby Middletown. Schmoozing: Brian Williams, second from right, showed up at a fundraiser for the Mater Dei Catholic prep school he attended until 1977. He also shelled out $50,000 to a save-the-school fund . Back in the day: Williams is pictured above in the 1970s, when he attended the high school . Budding: Williams, right, was editor of the student newspaper at the New Jersey school . Speaking to the Two River Times, Williams waxed lyrical about his schooldays. He said: 'I had four great years here. I did not know it then, but it was the last degree I’d ever earn. It’s a wonderful school, and it should be open for a long time, for everybody'. 'Four great years': Williams committed to helping save the school just before NBC suspended him . According to the Asbury Park Press, Williams topped off his attendance at the $125-per-head dinner with a $50,000 donation. He handed over the cash without a salary to back it up - as NBC has cut his pay for the duration of his six-month suspension. Williams left Mater Dei in 1977. Afterwards he attended community college and two universities, but never graduated. According to the gala's organizer, Maria Buzzanco, there were 'warm hugs' for the beleaguered anchor at the event, and 'everyone was telling him how much they support him'. He first committed to trying to help save the school days before he was punished by NBC bosses for telling exaggerated tales about covering the Iraq war. Williams had routinely claimed he was on board a Chinook helicopter which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, which miraculously did not explode. He later admitted he wasn't there. His old school has also been struggling in recent months, announcing in February it needed to raise an urgent $1million on top of the $10,000 a year it collects from each of its students. Fundraisers say they now have more than $900,000 of their hoped-for total, some $80,000 of which was raised at the fundraiser Williams attended.

"Arrest: William Lindauer, 31, allegedly set his family's home on fire a year after his divorce . A man has been arrested on arson charges after firefighters raced to his burning Colorado home and found 'my wife is a cheater' scrawled on the outside of the house. William Lindauer, 31, was taken into custody hours after the early-morning blaze on Nelson Street, Arvada on Tuesday, police said. He made his first court appearance in Jefferson County court on Wednesday morning. Jail records show he is being held on investigation of first-degree arson, reckless endangerment, prohibited use of weapons, cruelty to animals and criminal mischief, ABC7 reported. His wife filed for divorce in October 2013 and it was completed on February 18, 2014, the channel reported. Property records list him at the address with Brianne Lindauer, 29. Neighbors said that three young children lived at the home but that they had not seen the woman or her children in weeks, ABC7 reported. The Arvada Fire Protection District said everyone in the home had been accounted for and there were no reports of injuries. After multiple calls from neighbors, the district responded to the home early on Tuesday and found it engulfed in flames.

Crews were initially unable to enter the home because the floor has been weakened by the 'very significant' damage, she said. They also found a name had been painted on the side of the house but it is not clear if he is connected to the fire. After the flames were brought under control, officials covered up the scrawled words with blue tarps. Destroyed: Later on Tuesday morning, firefighters covered the graffiti outside the house with blue tarps . Debris was also found in the street, including patio furniture, fire officials said. Police said that investigations showed the fire had been intentionally set. The Arvada Fire Protection District and Arvada Police Department are conducting a joint investigation into the blaze. Neighbors expressed their shock over the incident. 'It's a younger family,' Fred Holman told KDVR. 'They've lived here about five years, maybe a little longer. They're very nice people, very good neighbors. I would never think anything like this would happen.'","William Lindauer was arrested for arson and other charges hours after the home in Arvada, Colorado was set on fire on Tuesday morning .

"A husband and wife were today found guilty of stashing some £50million worth of stolen Picasso art treasures in their garage for almost 40 years. Pierre Le Guennec, 74, and Danielle, 73, were given a suspended prison sentence of two years by a court in the French Riviera town of Grasse. Both had insisted that they were all 'presents' from the legendary Spanish artist, but the court found they were 'fraudulently obtained' and ordered them to be returned to his family. Pierre Le Guennec (right) and his wife Danielle wait for the verdict of their trial. The court today found the couple were found guilty of stashing the 'fraudulently obtained' artwork . The couple address the media following the verdict, in which they were ordered to return the Picasso treasures and given a suspended prison sentence of two years . It was in November 2010 that 271 lithographs, cubist paintings, notebooks and a watercolour were found at their modest home in Mouans-Sartoux, in the South of France. But six of Picasso's descendants accused them of the crime, and will now take charge of the works. During the trial, all 271 works, created between 1900 and 1932, were beamed onto a giant screen inside the court. Le Guennec claimed he was given the collection by the artist and his second wife, Jacqueline, when he was an odd job man at their home in Notre-Dame-de-Vie in Mougins, near Cannes. Le Guennec, a qualified electrician, installed a burglar alarm at the luxury villa before the artist died in 1973, and said he accepted them as 'thank you' gifts. Referring to Picasso, Mr Le Guennec said he 'often invited me in to have some cake or a coffee. Me and the master talked about all things great and small. 'One evening, I was leaving my work, when Madame handed me a little package saying: 'This is for you'. But Claude Picasso, the artist's son, said that his father was noted for his generosity, but that he always dedicated, dated and signed his gifts, as he knew that some recipients might try to sell the works one day. Two of the newly discovered Picasso drawings, one in a notebook (above left), and the other called 'Nature Morte Verre' (Still life Glass) Jean-Jacques Neuer, Claude Picasso's barrister, said: 'They don't remember whether they received the so called gift in 1970, 71 or 72. If you are given 271 Picassos, you remember it. 'You have to imagine that Picasso kept hold of them for 70 years and suddenly decided to give the lot away. That's doesn't make sense.' The only document with the name Le Guennec on is a signed brochure for a Picasso exhibition, said Mr Neuer. 'When you give a present, you choose something precise that fits the person,' said Mr Neuer. 'Picasso here is giving away works that have nothing to do with each other - notably extremely precious cubist collages that represent 10 per cent of his production,' he said. The couple listen to Judge Jean-Christophe Bruyere give the verdict at a court in Grasse, southeast France . Picasso's son Claude Ruiz (left) and daughter Maya sit in the courtroom today awaiting the verdict . Another Picasso drawing, this time of a horse, from Pierre Le Guennec's collection that he kept in his garage . 'But also two notebooks of drawings, work tools that he would never have given away. The issue is not whether Picasso was generous or not. Picasso wasn't someone who was careless about his works – he didn't give work away just for the sake of it.' Charles-Etienne Gudin, lawyer for the couple, said the works came from the artist's 'Grands-Augustins' studio on Paris's Left Bank. He said that Mr Le Guennec would never have stolen from the Picasso's villa, describing it as a 'fortress' watched over night and day by security guards. The trial comes after Marina Picasso, the artist's granddaughter, said she was selling of the famous villa, along with a selection of his work, for up to £190m. Ms Picasso wrote a memoir 'Picasso: My Grandfather' in 2001, in which she accused him of destroying her childhood. Picasso's works are the most stolen of any artist in history. He has more than 1,000 paintings registered as taken unlawfully, missing or disputed. A painting of a hand by Picasso that was among 271 undocumented, never-before-seen works estimated to be worth at least £50million . A painting 'Still life glass sand' and a drawing 'Nu Assis (Sitting nude)' which feature among the 271 hitherto unseen works by Picasso produced by the artist's odd job man .","In 2010, a French couple revealed they possessed 271 Picasso artworks .

"The mesmerising patterns of our changing climate have been revealed in artistic computer simulations used to analyse global warming. The paint-like swirls depict global water-surface temperatures around the world, with the surface texture driven by the rotation of the Earth. Using data from various climate models, trapped regions of warmer water, shown in red, are seen adjacent to the Gulf Stream off the eastern coast of the U.S. The paint-like swirls of this visualisation depict global water-surface temperatures. Cool temperatures are shown by blues and warmer temperatures by reds. Trapped regions of warmer water adjacent to the Gulf Stream off the eastern coast of the U.S. indicate the model’s capability to simulate eddy transport of heat within the ocean, a key component necessary to accurately simulate global climate change . The model, by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, is used to simulate eddy transportation of heat within the ocean, a key component necessary to accurately simulate climate change. These are circular movements of water, counter to a main current, causing a small whirlpool. ‘Computer models of the global ocean must capture these eddies and their impact on ocean circulation in order to accurately represent the climate system and future climate change,’ LANL says. ‘This is difficult because the small size (10–100 km) of eddies requires high spatial resolution and substantial computing power’. Global ocean surface kinetic - or movement - energy is pictured here. The maximum kinetic energy shown by white with minimum values in black. Color is on a log scale. Observe the prominent jet stream off the eastern coast of the U.S. with adjacent eddy rings . The world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change, scientists have warned. US researchers claim that the fast onset of global warming is set to alter the way people live, even over short time scales. This is according to new evidence which suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25°C per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years. The analysis was based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world . Scientists recently announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central Pacific Ocean and have started to alter wind patterns. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Niño will continue through the summer. However, they say that the El Niño conditions are currently 'extremely weak' and come at a time of the year when the influence of El Niño on weather patterns usually declines. This means that while El Niño conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer, it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring. In another image the ocean surface kinetic energy – or movement energy – is revealed with maximum kinetic energy in white with minimum values in black. The illustration shows the prominent jet stream off the eastern coast of the U.S. with adjacent eddy rings. When winds blow across the ocean, kinetic energy is transferred from the wind to water as a result of the friction between the wind and the sea surface. Sunlight on the oceans also adds thermal energy to the surface layer, and currents carry the thermal energy to other regions of the world.","In one mesmerising image, the paint-like swirls depict global water-surface temperatures around the world .

"The Black Hawk helicopter that crashed in dense fog during a training mission in Florida was carrying seven Marines from Special Operations Command forces based in North Carolina, and four National Guard soldiers from Louisiana. Bad weather  prevented the recovery of bodies and the flight recorder from the wreckage on Thursday, and while the military had not officially released any times, loved one of those on the doomed copter did speak with the press.. Now however, the names and identities of the seven Marines have been revealed. Scroll down for video . Crews lower a piece of a Black Hawk helicopter onto a barge in the Santa Rosa Sound near Pritchard Point in Florida . Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif (left) and Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock (right) Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif was a Silver Star Medal recipient who received the award for facing enemy fire to save a mortally wounded friend in Afghanistan in July 2012. He was born in Fairbanks, Alaska, and lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until middle-school when his family moved to Holland, Michigan, the Marines said. Seif, 26, grew up playing soldier in his backyard and joined the Marines just weeks after graduating from high school, according to an article about his award published this week in the Camp Lejeune Globe, the post newspaper. By 2012, he had spent two years as a special forces operator with the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, which operates from the Middle East to Central Asia. Seif and his teammate, Sgt. Justin Hansen, were closing in on one of western Afghanistan's bomb experts, according to the paper. They came under fire, and Hansen was hit. Seif moved Hansen to safer position and treated his teammate's wounds. Seif returned fire, advanced alone across the compound and found the targeted bomb-maker. 'The fact that (Seif) continued to fight through the objective to get Sgt. Hansen taken care of, putting himself in the line of fire, speaks volumes to who he is and demonstrates that he would never leave a Marine behind,' said Maj. Gen. Joseph L. Osterman. Seif's wife was at his side when he received the medal. Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock, 29, was born in Lake Orion, Michigan, and swam on the varsity swim team. He attended Henry Ford Community College for one year before joining the Marine Corps in 2006. Initially, he was a mechanic in an armored reconnaissance battalion at Camp Pendleton in California. He served two tours in Iraq in 2007 and 2008. His decorations include the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Valor. His home near Camp Lejeune was within earshot of dull booming sounds of artillery or other heavy weapons. Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders (left) and Staff Sgt. Liam Flynn (right) Born in Bonn, Germany, Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders, 33, enlisted in the Marines after graduating from high school in Virginia. Following basic training in 1999, he was assigned to Camp LeJeune. He deployed to Kosovo and served with special operations teams in Iraq and Afghanistan before years before joining a Marine Corps special operations unit in 2010. He spent eight months as a liaison to Army Special Operations Command before joining his Middle East-focused regiment four years ago. He was married to a fellow Marine based at Camp Lejeune, and the couple has one son, according to an award by the Marine Corps Association & Foundation naming Saunders its special forces operator of 2014. Born in Reading, England, Staff Sgt. Liam Flynn, 33, moved to Queens, New York in 2002. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2006. After boot camp, he was assigned to Camp Lejeune. He served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan before joining the Marine Corps' special operations force in 2011 and returning to Afghanistan in 2012. Flynn's heroism was honored by receiving three Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals with Valor and the Bronze Star with Valor. Capt. Stanford Henry Shaw III (left) and Staff Sgt. Marcus S. Bawol (right) Capt. Stanford Henry Shaw III, 31, was from Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and attended Ridge High School, where he was student government president and captain of the varsity lacrosse team. He attended the United States Naval Academy and became a commissioned Marine officer upon graduation in 2006. He graduated from the Infantry Officer Course and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines. He served two tours of duty in Iraq in 2007 and 2009, according to information provided by the Marines at Camp Lejeune. His career took him to Japan, where he became the deputy camp commander of a jungle warfare training center on Okinawa in 2011. He graduated from the Malaysian army's jungle warfare course and then joined the Marine special forces. Staff Sgt. Marcus S. Bawol of Warren, Michigan, ""loved everything about the military,"" said his sister, Brandy Peek. 'He couldn't wait to join. He wanted to fight for our country and was always striving to be the best Marine he could be,' Peek said. The 27-year-old graduated in 2006 from Warren Mott High School. Bawol played baseball and football and was a member of the school's swim team, according to district Superintendent Robert Livernois. Bawol attended Olivet College for a year, where he was a catcher on the baseball team. He had planned to marry his fiancée in October, Peek said. On Thursday, Warren Mayor Jim Fouts ordered flags in the city, just north of Detroit, flown at half-staff. Staff Sgt. Kerry Michael Kemp (above), 27, was the proud father of a baby just shy of her first birthday . Debris: Pentagon officials say the 11 on board are presumed and that the mission is now one of search and recover . Staff Sgt. Kerry Michael Kemp, 27, was the proud father of a baby just shy of her first birthday and loved horsing around with his nephews. 'He would wrestle with them. He really got into that, the wrestling and playing. He'd carry them around on his back,' said his sister-in-law, Lora Waraksa. He was a ""proud Marine, a loving husband and most wonderful father,"" she said. He also loved golfing and the ocean — he often took his nephews out to hunt for sea shells. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Kemp met his wife, Jenna, at Port Washington High School in Wisconsin, where he was voted ""best smile"" by his senior class. He graduated in 2005. He started as an artillery mechanic, and his military merit led to three quick promotions. He completed training in special operations in 2012 and spent seven months in Afghanistan before returning in June. Meanwhile, divers have found the wreckage of the military helicopter in just 25 feet of water. A small memorial stands in the sand along Highway 98 in Navarre, Florida . 'It was certainly a high-impact crash,' said Eglin Fire Chief Mark Giuliano, and 'very, very, very dense fog' was complicating the response. There's almost no visibility at the spot where the wreckage was found, forcing search crews to move slowly to avoid colliding with each other, and the surf is too rough still to pull the wreckage to the surface. Dozens of airmen walked the shores of Santa Rosa Sound Thursday, recovering pieces of clothing and bits of wreckage, but the U.S. Coast Guard suspended its search Thursday afternoon, and will instead focus on helping the Army recover the remaining fuselage and debris, it said. President Barack Obama has promised a thorough investigation into the cause, which is being led by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center out of Fort Rucker, Alabama. The helicopter went down Tuesday night in fog so thick that another helicopter turned back. American flags stand in the median near the bridge entrance to Navarre Beach, Florida . A woman at campground nearby, Kim Urr, said she heard a metallic sound and then two muffled explosions as it disappeared into the narrow waterway separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida panhandle mainland. This dense sea fog, which could persist through Friday, is common when warm southern air meets cold water this time of year, said Jack Cullen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mobile, Alabama. The same fog enveloped a large gathering holding a vigil on a pier Wednesday night. Crashing Gulf waves created a somber backdrop to the songs, tears and prayers of the people, who have strong ties to the military and the sprawling Eglin Air Force Base. 'My heart is really hurt right now knowing these people were here just on training - knowing they went and left their family members and did not give that goodbye, you know, because they weren't going off to war,' said a tearful Dolly Edwards, herself the wife of a Marine.","The identities of the seven Marines killed in a helicopter crash off the coast of Florida this week have been revealed .

"He discovered a passion for flying somewhat late in life. But Harrison Ford embraced it with gusto and claimed to fly his planes as much as he drove his vintage cars. The actor was 52 when he first seriously started flying lessons and over the years the Indiana Jones star has amassed an impressive aviation collection. The experienced and respected pilot keeps the aircraft at the Santa Monica Airport - which is where he was where he had taken off from in his two-seater PT- 22 shortly before he crashed on a nearby Venice golf course on Thursday. Current fave: Harrison Ford has been seen several times lately flying his silver and yellow PT-22 two-seater vintage plane in and out of Santa Monica Airport. He was last photographed taking off in the aircraft last Friday . A real-life action man: Ford, 72, once said that learning to fly gave him freedom and pleasure and he's survived a number of crashes over the years . The Ryan PT-22 Recruit with its silver metallic body and eye-catching yellow trim was built in 1942 and was primarily designed as a trainer for the U.S. Army Air Corps. Ford was regularly seen flying it in and out of Santa Monica Airport and was last photographed in it just a week ago on Friday February 27. In an interview with The Mail On Sunday back in 2010, the Blade Runner and Star Wars actor talked about some of the planes in his collection and the reasons he loves flying so much. 'Flying is like good music: it elevates the spirit and it's an exhilarating freedom.' he said. 'It's not a thrill thing or an adrenaline rush; it's engaging in a process that takes focus and commitment. Aviator: The 72-year-old actor keeps his collection of planes at Santa Monica Airport and routinely flies himself to and from his ranch in Wyoming . Ford, 72, has a long range jet, a Citation Sovereign,  a turboprop aircraft capable of operating on unimproved airstrips; and a de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver single engine bush plane. He also has a 1929 Waco Taperwing open-top biplane, an Aviat Husky, which is a two-seat fabric-covered bush plane, and a Bell 407 helicopter. In 1999, Ford was flying his helicopter along the Lake Piru riverbed, north-east of Los Angeles, when it went down in a hard landing during a routine training session. 'All of my planes are great to fly, and that's why I've got so many of them': The Indiana Jones star's collection includes an Aviat Husky, a Canadian de Havilland Beaver and several Cessnas as well as a 1929 open-top bi-plane and a Bell helicopter . After landing hard the aircraft  began skidding forward in the loose gravel before one of its skids struck a partially embedded log and flipped onto its side . Neither the actor nor his instructor were hurt although the helicopter was severely damaged. He later joked the incident gave him the opportunity to buy a new helicopter. The family that flies together.....: The star often uses his private jet to fly his wife, actress Calista Flockhart and their son Liam from place to place . Ford once described crashing a plane as being like scraping a bumper and said he used his planes as much he used his cars. 'I'm so passionate about flying, I often fly up the coast for a cheeseburger,' he said in 2010. The Hollywood star often flies to and from his  ranch in Wyoming and has used his helicopter there to aid Search and Rescue crews locate missing hikers. It's not a Millenium Falcon but the Han Solo actor still loves flying his own planes and is happy to do it all, even carrying his own bags on and off the aircraft . Ford has twice assisted local search and rescue teams with his helicopter, including one instance in which he picked up a hiker who became dehydrated. He donated his flying skills to non-profit organizations, including Operation Smile and the Special Olympics, and flew medical personnel and supplies to Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. The father-of-five has played leading roles in at least two rescues, helping evacuate a missing hiker and a Boy Scout on separate occasions in 2001. Up in the air: Ford who just confirmed he plans to make a sequel to the 1982 cult classic Bladerunner, is a veteran pilot with 20 years experience . With his need for speed, Ford collects vintage cars and motorbikes, . He has about a dozen motorcycles including several BMWs, a couple of Harleys, Hondas and a Triumph. He has vintage cars too including a rare 1955 forest green convertible  Jaguar XK 140 worth about $150,000. Ford is married to actress Calista Flockhart and they have a teenage son Liam. Not just planes: Ford also has an extensive motorcycle collection as well as some vintage cars .",Back in 1999 Ford walked away unscathed after his helicopter flipped over in hard landing .
"Two brothers have pleaded guilty to starving more than one million chickens after some of the animals resulted to cannibalism due to insufficient food. Veteran chicken farmers Gerry and Chris Apostolatos stopped feeding the chickens across their six farms in Victoria when their business Tip Top Livestock fell on hard times in December 2011, The Age reports. More than 86,000 chickens starved to death under the care of Gerry Apostolatos at six sites, while his brother Chris was responsible for 804,000 chickens on three farms where more than 63,000 died. Veteran chicken farmers Gerry and Chris Apostolatos stopped feeding the chickens across their six farms in Victoria when their business Tip Top Livestock fell on hard times in December 2011 (file photo) When animal welfare officers were alerted to the chickens, they found some of them had turned to cannibalism to survive and others suffered from malnutrition and lameness. The brothers, who had been in the chicken farming business for 30 years, pleaded guilty to multiple animal cruelty charges at Melbourne Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Prosecutor George Georgiou SC said the animal cruelty case was one of the worst to come before the court as he revealed the chickens were starved between December 2011 and February 2012. The company ran into financial difficulty and had trouble making payments for food, the court heard. The brothers' processing plant was shut down by authorities in November 2011 due to hygiene concerns and feed bills grew to $1 million a week because they couldn't keep up. More than 86,000 chickens starved to death under the care of Gerry Apostolatos at six sites, while his brother Chris was responsible for 804,000 chickens on three farms where more than 63,000 died (file photo) Costly conditions were set before it was allowed to reopen and when it did the company was in so much debt it couldn't be saved. A contractor reported claims of animal cruelty in February 2012 and the chickens were seized. Gerry was later declared bankrupt and the company was forced into liquidation. Chris Apostolatos pleaded guilty to six charges each of cruelty and and aggravated cruelty. His brother Gerry pleaded guilty to three each of the same charges. The pair will be sentenced at a later date.","Gerry and Chris Apostolatos pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges .

"A Brooklyn woman who was overdue in her pregnancy and her husband were able to successfully deliver their baby daughter into the world this week ... on the backseat of an Uber car. Zanna Gilbert, 34, an art historian at New York's Museum of Modern Art, woke up around 5am Monday with contractions. Her husband, David Horvitz, 33, opened the Uber app on his phone and saw there was a car available just five minutes from their apartment in Crown Heights. The couple told their driver Germaine Allen, 32, to take them to Mount Sinai Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side, about 12 miles from their home. However, just a few blocks from the hospital, it became apparent they were not going to make it. Happy family: Zanna Gilbert went into labor in the back of an Uber car en route to the hospital Monday morning. Her husband, David Horvitz, delivered their daughter Ela on the backseat . Rider onesie: Following the dramatic birth, Uber paid for the driver's car to be cleaned and sent both the driver and the couple gifts. The latter received an Uber onesie for Ela . 'Zanna was in labor, but we didn't realize it - we thought she was in pre-labor, so we thought, ''We'll go to the hospital now'',' Horvitz, an artist, told Artnet News. 'Zanna told me later that she had the urge to push, but she didn't want to freak anyone out. 'Then she said, ''I think I'm going to have the baby now''. 'It's blurry after that, but I remember picking up the baby. 'I caught it when it was coming out, but it was dark, so I didn't know it was coming out.' Ela Melanie was born on 57th Street and Park Avenue. She weighed in at seven pounds. Have you ever?: New York artist David Horvitz, 33, posted a photo to Twitter Monday after delivering his baby daughter on the backseat of an Uber car en route to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan . According to The New York Post, the driver, Allen, who had pulled over, drove on to the hospital, and Gilbert and the baby was rushed into emergency. 'I just kept telling the driver I was sorry,' Horvitz told The Post. 'But he said, ''Don't worry, that was amazing!''' Horvitz posted a picture to his Twitter of the Uber car where the birth occurred, along with the caption: 'have you ever delivered a baby in the backseat of an @uber ? i have.' Uber paid to have Allen's car cleaned. They also sent Allen, who is a father-to-be himself, tickets to see the Knicks, and the new parents a onesie for Ela with 'Uber Rider' on it. 'This is one of those only-in-New-York stories,' Josh Mohrer, a general manager for Uber in New York, told The Post.

"The robbery of a South African news team has sent shock waves through the country after the brazen muggers were filmed on the crew's camera stealing their equipment at gunpoint. Vuyo Mvoko, a contributing editor for SABC News, was preparing for a 7pm live report outside Johannesburg's Milpark Hospital when the incident occurred. Footage of the robbery shows him standing under lights and in front of the camera, while two men can be seen walking past in the background. Scroll down for video . Presenter Vuyo Mvoko can be seen preparing himself for a live cross when one of the men (far right) approaches from behind . After he is disrupted, two men in full view of the camera begin taking the new crew's valuables . At first he ignores them, but when they double back claiming to have a gun, Mr Mvoko's live cross is disrupted. The men can then be seen demanding Mr Mvoko's mobile phone before also taking a collection of the crew's possessions and their work laptop. In a later interview with a SABC News host, Mr Mvoko said they had spotted his phone, which was still in his hand after just having spoken to his producer in anticipation of going live on the news bulletin. He added: 'So I gave him the phone, then I think they took about two or three phones. And the laptop we were using to do the (live) crossing. Then they just disappeared.' Mr Mvoko also tweeted a link to the video of the robbery, stating: 'I'm Safe & sound. Here's how it all happnd (sic).' Police did eventually arrive and have vowed to track down the men responsible. Lieutenant-general Lesetja Mothiba, the Gauteng Provincial Commissioner, said police were 'shocked at the brazen nature of the crime'. Mr Mvoko later tweeted a link to the mugging video (pictured) and said he was 'safe and sound' A police spokesperson said that minutes after the robbery the news crew spotted and approached a policeman who happened to be driving past. Despite driving around the area in an attempt to find the men responsible, they were unable to locate them and a case of robbery and theft was opened. The South African National Editors' Forum appealed to anyone who recognized the assailants from the video footage to alert police to their identities. 'Every South African lives with the reality of crime, but to see thugs brazenly ignoring television cameras and robbing media workers in the course of their work, yet again brings home the level of criminality in our society,' the editors' group said in a statement.

Blair describes herself as 'Loyal to my babies' on her Facebook page. Blair posted a photo with a message in January . On January 30, the posted a photo with a message. It read: 'There is no greater blessing than being called MOM.' Before she was taken into custody, the mother reportedly said her son was raped and that the sexual assault had been carried out by his siblings. Police have not confirmed that is the case and it is unclear if she was talking about the boy who was found in the freezer. She filed a paternity suit in 1999 which resulted in a man being ordered to pay child support. Blair filed another suit in 2007 against another man which had the same result. She had not been charged as of Tuesday evening. Her brother Marlon Blair said: 'It's too early to even say what this could be, or to make any judgments. 'She didn't have any emotional problems from what I'm aware of. I don't know what to say about this.' Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt said it appeared the bodies had been in the freezer for 'over a year' and that the mother had been living in the apartment 'with other children while the bodies were in the freezer'. 'This is a terrible situation,' he said. According to Craig, Blair has two other children, aged 11 and 17, who are unharmed and currently in 'protective custody'. No weapons were discovered after the apartment was searched and police do not yet have a motive. Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, said Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'. There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official. People did notice that two of her children seemed to disappear about a year ago. Lanier said: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house. 'Or sometimes she'd tell people they stayed inside because they didn't like to be around people.' Craig said the police are still 'trying to determine what happened'. The cause of death won't be known until after autopsies are conducted. Tori Childs, who also lives in the complex, told the Detroit News she often saw the children and sometimes gave them clothes or food. She said they were 'the nicest kids' who were 'so respectable'. 'This is just wrong,' she said in tears. Childs said she saw two bodies on the floor after police arrived at the home. 'It was a little girl and a little boy,' she said. 'The little girl had on a pink jacket.' A neighbor, Tori Childs (center), was led away from the scene as law enforcement investigated on Tuesday . Police said the mother was taken into custody and is a person of interest. Her two other children, aged 11 and 17, are unharmed and in protective custody. No weapons were found when the apartment was searched . Shanetria Lanier, another neighbor in the complex, said her sister received a phone call around 6am on Tuesday from a woman who lives inside the apartment. The woman asked to stay at Lanier's sister's home with her two children that day, according to Lanier, and was there when the bodies were found.

"Scores of protesters gathered around the courthouse  in support of a mother after a judge issued an arrest order on Tuesday for her after she fled with her son to prevent his circumcision and ignored a demand to appear in court. Circuit Judge Jeffrey Gillen signed the order in a seven-minute hearing, three days after finding Heather Hironimus in contempt and warning that she would face imprisonment unless she reported to court with the child. Her attorney, Thomas Hunker, said his client is staying with her 4-year-old son in a shelter for domestic violence victims because the boy was 'scared to death' of undergoing the surgery. Dennis Nebus of Boca Raton, right, sits in court on Tuesday, with his lawyers May Cain and William Snihur, Jr., in a continuing legal battle with Heather Hironimus, the mother of his four-year-old son over circumcision . Warrant for arrest: Circuit Judge Jeffrey Gillen signed the order in a seven-minute hearing, three days after finding Heather Hironimus in contempt and warning that she would face imprisonment . Hironimus and the boy's father, Dennis Nebus, were never married but share custody of their child. 'I was hoping the mother was going to be here,' Nebus' attorney May L. Cain said on Tuesday. 'I was, too,' Gillen replied. The Florida Sun-Sentinel reports that the the judge last week called it 'reprehensible' for the mom to have kept the boy's location hidden from the father since February  20. 'I will allow her to avoid incarceration or get out of jail if she signs the consent to the procedure,' Gillen said Friday. In a parenting agreement filed in court, the two agreed to the boy's circumcision, but the mother later changed her mind, leading to a long court battle. The father said he decided to pursue the circumcision in December 2013 when the boy was 3, after noticing his son was urinating on his leg, reports The Sun Sentinel. The father on Friday said the boy's pediatrician had diagnosed a condition called phimosis, which prevents retraction of the foreskin and that can be cured with circumcision. Circuit and appellate judges have sided with the father, but potential surgeons have backed out after refusing to get the mother's consent or becoming the target of anti-circumcision protesters who side with her. Supporters of Heather Hironiumus gather out side of the South County Courthouse in Delray Beach, Florida where the mother was to face off in court with the father of her child, Dennis Nebus . 'She did this for one reason and one reason only: because the child is scared to death of this procedure,' Hunker told Gillen, launching into a defense that was cut off by the judge. 'So Mr. Hunker, I take it then that the mother is not going to appear today?' the judge said. 'Correct, your honor,' Hunker replied. 'OK, that's all I needed to know,' Gillen said. 'Your honor, if I may,' the lawyer pleaded. 'No, you may not,' the judge shot back. Although circumcision rates have fallen in the U.S., a majority of boys still undergo the procedure to remove their foreskin. Meantime, a movement opposing circumcision has developed, and the case has become a rallying cry for so-called 'intactivists' who deride the surgery as barbaric. A small group of those anti-circumcision advocates gathered outside the court to demonstrate in support of Hironimus, and expressed outrage over the judge's order. 'It's just ridiculous,' said one of the protesters, Jennifer Cote of Pembroke Pines. 'She's protecting her son.' Supporters of Heather Hironiumus, Anthony Mollical and Zeresh Altork, gather outside of the South County Courthouse in Delray Beach where Hironiumus was meant to appear with her child on Tuesday .","Circuit Judge Jeffrey Gillen ordered arrest for mom Heather Hironimus who fled with her son to prevent his circumcision .

"A website which collects together pictures of London's most handsome male commuters has proved a huge hit in China  - but it might not be quite for the intended reason. TubeCrush.net is filled with pictures of the capital's finest looking men on the Underground, uploaded by fellow commuters for others to rate and share. It has proved exceedingly popular since it was set up in 2011, with almost 10,000 likes of Facebook and  8,600 followers on Twitter. But it seems these figures drastically underestimate the actual popularity of the site, because they fail to take into account a massive audience in China. Scroll down for video . Papped: Fellow commuters take pictures of good looking men to share on the website TubeCrush.net . Rating: Fellow users can then rate the men on their 'hotness' - although the website's tone is always positive . Popular: TubeCrush has almost 10,000 likes of Facebook and 8,600 followers on Twitter . TubeCrush has been trending on Weibo, the country's own version of Twitter, revealing that pictures from the UK website are being shared tens of thousands of times. According to BBC Trending, comments include 'I want to take Tubes everyday!' and 'Handsome people really look good in anything'. Some experts have suggested the popularity of the pictures is down to the impression given of all British men being well-groomed and well-mannered - a Chinese cliche. However, it is not always the men's arms, stubble or sharp suits which is making people share the images. It transpires some are more taken with the space available to commuters on London's Tube network. 'You think we like the men; we just like looking at men taking up so much space on the Tube,' The Times reported one commenter as saying. International appeal: The good-looking men of London are also creating waves on the otherside of the world . Thousands: One picture can get 100,000 shares - popularity boosted by the 'Downton Abbey' effect . Room: But some have alleged it is more to do with the space on the Tube, rather than the dashing gentleman . Packed: The two cities driving most of the Chinese traffic to TubeCrush.net are Shanghia and Guangzhou - which have the fourth and sixth busiest metro systems in the world, respectively. Pictured: Shanghai metro . 'Look at where the traffic to this site comes from - it's all from cities where our own underground systems are massively overcrowded.' Tubecrush.net co-founder Stephen Motion, confirmed to the BBC that most of the Chinese traffic was driven by people from Guangzhou and Shanghai. Both cities metro systems are in the top ten busiest networks in the world. Guangzhou Metro had 2.28billion passengers in 2014, putting it sixth in the list, while Shanghai's 2.824billion passengers meant it was the fourth busiest globally, according to RailwayTechnology.com. In comparison, London has just 1.265billion passengers last year. 'I suppose TubeCrush could be misinterpreted,' Motion said. 'Perhaps people who are travelling on the underground system in China are thinking more about space [than good looking men].' He joked: 'It's probably driving the traffic.'","Tubecrush.net collects photos of the Tube's best looking commuters .

"A Christian blogger and mother-of-four who begged fellow cancer sufferer Brittany Maynard not to end her life has died aged 38. Kara Tippetts, an author from Colorado Springs, Colorado, passed away on Sunday after a lengthy battle with breast cancer, a friend wrote on Tippetts' website, Mundane Faithfulness. 'She refused to be defined by cancer and considered every moment a gift and an opportunity to learn more about Grace and trusting God,' friend Blythe Hunt wrote. Last October, Tippetts penned an open letter to Maynard, a terminal brain cancer patient and a physician-assisted suicide advocate who had decided to take her own life before her suffering worsened. Loss: Kara Tippetts, an author and a married mother-of-four pictured undergoing chemotherapy last year, passed away on Sunday following a lengthy battle with breast cancer. She was just 38 . Tippetts wrote to her: 'You have been told a lie. A horrible lie, that your dying will not be beautiful. That the suffering will be too great. 'I pray (my words) reach the multitudes that are looking at your story and believing the lie that suffering is a mistake, that dying isn't to be braved, that choosing our death is the courageous story.' She went on: 'In your choosing your own death, you are robbing those that love you with the such tenderness, the opportunity of meeting you in your last moments and extending you love in your last breaths.' But Tippetts also thanked Maynard for sharing her story and told her she loved her. Speaking in an earlier interview, Maynard had explained: 'There is not a cell in my body that is suicidal or that wants to die. I want to live. I wish there was a cure for my disease but there's not.' Plea: She famously penned an open letter to Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old brain cancer sufferer (pictured) who took her life last November. Tippetts had pleaded with Maynard to die naturally . Maynard, who was married, died on November 1, 2014 aged just 29. After the letter was shared thousands of times online, Tippetts' book, 'The Hardest Peace', soared to number 14 on Amazon's bestseller list. Tippetts said she was shocked. 'I knew I wanted (Maynard) to be able to hear my letter and feel my love, but I never expected to be in this position,' she told the Colorado Springs Gazette. 'I never expected to be this voice, but it's an important conversation so I'm entering it.' Tippetts also leaves behind her husband Jason, whom she married in 1998, and their children Eleanor Grace, Harper Joy, Lake Edward and Story Jane. Her husband founded the Westside Church in Colorado Springs. In December, her publishers confirmed she had entered hospice care. Family: Tippetts, a Christian blogger, is pictured with her pastor husband Jason and their four children . Final post: On March 12, she shared this picture to Facebook showing her with her husband Jason, writing: 'Today I'm fading, I can see it in the tears in his eyes... May we continue to enjoy each moment' In her final blog post on March 10, Tippetts said a nurse had told her she had just days to live - 'News I frankly don't believe,' she wrote. 'I do see where cancer is having it's way with my body,' she went on. 'Where I'm growing weaker or pain is growing stronger. It's been made clear to me I'm fading. I'm just in denial... 'I feel too young to be in this battle, but maybe I'm not in a battle at all. Maybe I'm on a journey, and the journey is more beautiful than any of us can comprehend.' Then on March 12, she shared a photo to Facebook showing her smiling beside her husband. 'Today I'm fading, I can see it in the tears in his eyes,' she wrote. 'There is going to be grace for this... May we continue to enjoy each moment. Will you do the same?'","Kara Tippetts, from Colorado Springs, Colorado, passed away on Sunday .

"Evicence: Police commander David Duckenfield, 70, pictured today, has denied claims he helped cook up a conspiracy to conceal police failings after Hillsborough . The commander in charge at Hillsborough said today he was not behind a police conspiracy to cover up their  part in the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans. David Duckenfield, 70, has admitted his failure to close a tunnel caused dozens of deaths but denied claims he then helped conceal 'very serious professional failings'. The retired chief superintendent from South Yorkshire Police spoke out as he gave evidence for a seventh day at the hearing in Warrington. He admitted that as the man in charge on April 15 1989 'the buck stops with me', but said he was inexperienced and had inherited a safety plan from the previous year. Defence barrister John Beggs QC asked him: 'It has been suggested by some of the barristers sitting in front of me there was some conspiracy to interfere with a fair collection of evidence. Did you have any part in that?' Duckenfield said: 'None at all, sir.' Mr Beggs said: 'Did you know anything about it?' Duckenfield replied: 'I did not'. Mr Beggs asked: 'Did you at any stage even encourage any other police officer or police civilians to change his or her statement?' He said: 'No, sir.' Mr Beggs went on: 'Did you change the content of the statement that the jury know was made by you on or before May 3 1989?' He said: 'No, sir.' Mr Beggs said: 'Did anyone ever ask you to change your statement?' He said: 'No, sir.' He confirmed he had no role in the subsequent investigation by West Midlands Police into the tragedy and had no part either in the direction of the force's case at Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry. Mr Beggs said it had been suggested by a number of barristers at the inquests that Mr Duckenfield alone should bear responsibility for the tragedy. Mr Duckenfield agreed he had nothing to do with previous turnstile 'failures' at Sheffield Wednesday and no one had advised him about them. He had no say on Liverpool being awarded the smaller end of the ground for the match with just 23 turnstiles. In reality, he had 'inherited' the police operation for the match. He also had nothing to do with signage at the ground or previous decisions to install perimeter fences and radial fences, its architectural features or any breaches of stadium safety guidance on crush barrier heights. Mr Beggs asked: 'If supporters turned up later in 1989 than in 1988, for whatever reason, was that something with which you had any control?' 'No sir, ' said Mr Duckenfield. Admissions: David Duckenfield, sketched giving evidence for a seventh day,  admitted he 'froze' during the 1989 football disaster before he ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion . Tragedy: 96 Liverpool fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded Leppings Lane terrace in 1989 . Yesterday Duckenfield, 70, said his decisions were a 'direct cause' of the 96 deaths and claimed he 'froze' as the disaster unfolded. He also admitted being unfamiliar with the layout of the Sheffield Wednesday ground and said the FA Cup semi-final in 1989 was his first time in charge of a match. During questioning by Paul Greaney QC, for the Police Federation, he admitted he had caused the deaths of the fans. Mr Duckenfield, who retired in 1991, accepted he 'froze' before ordering the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion outside the Leppings Lane turnstile. But 2,000 fans then entered Gate C, with many heading straight for the tunnel in front of them which Mr Duckenfield had not ordered to be closed. He said 'yes sir' when asked if the fatal crush would have been avoided if he had closed this tunnel which led to the already packed central terrace pens. Mr Greaney then asked if he had failed to recognise he needed to close the tunnel and Mr Duckenfield again agreed. The inquests continue.

The solitary young bird stands out from the crowd as it wanders among the large group - made up of around 200,000 penguins - at the Salisbury Plain in South Georgia, USA. While the fluffy chick is distinguishable for the rest because of its warm coat of feathers, the other penguins surrounding him are older and have the typical, black and white 'tuxedo' tone. Scroll down for videos . Spot the difference: A young chick wanders through the huge bird colony in South Georgia . Striking: The young bird struts along the older King Penguins, who look like they are dressed in 'tuxedos' Cute: Photographer Sergey Kokinskly said he thought the chick might have been looking for his parents when he ended up in the middle of older penguins . Photographer Sergei Kokinskiy travelled from his home in Tula, Russia, to capture the special moment a young chick walked into the huge colony. The 49-year-old said: 'There are certain rules when visiting this part of the island. 'For example, it is forbidden to approach penguins closer than five metres, otherwise you will frighten the birds. 'One shaggy, brown bird in the photograph is a king penguin chick. 'He waits on the banks for his parents who go to the sea to get food. Returning, the parents seek out their young among the thousands of the same brown lumps. 'Perhaps the penguin was hungry and went looking for his parents and has obviously ended up in the middle of the other older penguins. 'I love the contrast between the single brown chick and the beautiful adult birds, who look like they are dressed in their 'tuxedos'.' Baby penguins, known as woollies, keep their brown downy feathers for a year, while they develop a thick layer of blubber that keeps them warm through the winter. King penguin chicks are cared for by their parents for around 40 days before they join a 'creche' for warmth and protection from predators. Their parents return occasionally during the winter to feed them. Males incubate the eggs much like Emperor penguins, but King penguins do this during the warmer summer season. The female goes to the open sea to feed and return in about 21 days so the male only goes a month without food. Change: The King Penguin chick on the right has patchy brown feathers.

"A bungling Romanian government staffer has been sacked after a minister mistakenly handed a gift to his German counterpart with a map of France, not Germany, inscribed on it. Officials were left red-faced after Germany's foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier received the gift from Romania's  Bogdan Aurescu at the end of a news conference marking 135 years of diplomatic relations. But what was immediately apparent was that the map on the brochure, filled with the colors of the German flag, was that of France, not Germany. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his Romanian counterpart Bogdan Aurescu exchange the gift unaware it shows a map of France filled with the colors of the German flag . Mr Steinmeier unwittingly holds the brochure aloft after it was given to him by the Romanian government . Pictures show the two ministers grinning and posing for photos as Mr Steinmeier receives the gift unaware the obvious error is being displayed to the world. Today the foreign ministry said it had fired spokeswoman Brandusa Predescu, saying the incident 'projected a totally unfavorable image.' Romania also said Mr Steinmeier had responded diplomatically, claiming he hadn't noticed the mistake. Immediately following the mix-up, Romania's Foreign Ministry apologized, saying it had received the brochure in the morning containing the error from national news agency Agerpres. Its statement read: 'Due to a regrettable technical error, exclusively on the cover of the booklet, the border of the maps of Romania and France - with the latter being covered by the German flag - was printed. 'The Romanian foreign minister has directly conveyed profound regret for this situation to his German counterpart.' New agency Agerpres later apologized to both the German and Romanian foreign ministries for the mix-up, as did the printing company. It is the second time in just over a month that Romania's foreign ministry has had to apologise for a mistake. In February the Romanian embassy in Paris sent out invitations for a reception and accidentally attached a spreadsheet with unflattering descriptions of guests such as 'undesirable' or 'ghastly'.","Bungling Romanian government staffer fired for  Germany map mix up .

"The devastated parents of a New Zealand man, jailed for making a joke about Buddha, have revealed the horrific conditions their son is suffering through in a Myanmar prison. Wellington-based Brian and Angela Blackwood have launch an online petition to campaign for Philip Backwood's freedom, insisting that their son and his colleagues have been unjustly convicted. They have revealed their pain they feel as they can not help their son, who is being subjected to the brutal conditions inside Yangon's notorious Insein Prison. He has been sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. He has been held in the jail since his arrest in December. 'He sleeps on a wooden pallet, no bedding is allowed, no mattress, no pillow,' Brian told ABC. He is only allowed to see his fiancé Noemi Alamo and their seven-month-old daughter for an hour every fortnight. Scroll down for video . Philip Blackwood (C) is escorted by police to a court hearing in Yangon. Blackwood and his two Myanmar colleagues were sentenced  to two and a half years in jail for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks . Two weeks ago the bar manager and his two Myanmar colleagues were jailed for two and a half years with hard labour by a Yangon court for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks night. However, Blackwood's hard labour penalty has been lifted as he is a foreigner. The ad posted on Facebook in December caused a stir of outrage in the former junta-ruled country, where surging Buddhist nationalism and religious violence has sparked international concern. Philip Blackwood, who worked at the VGastro bar in Yangon, was found guilty of insulting religion, after the New Zealander posted a mocked-up photo of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook — in reference to a well-known international club brand. The three convicted men have the support of a number of human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The group have condemned the court's ruling and called for the unconditional release of Mr. Blackwood and his colleagues. 'It is ludicrous that these three men have been jailed simply for posting an image online to promote a bar,' a spokesperson for Amnesty International in South East Asia and the Pacific said. “They should be immediately and unconditionally released.” According to International commission of Jurists in the Asia and Pacific, the conviction violates Mynamar's own legal standards. 'The conviction violates international standards for imprisoning people for speech (and) seems to violate Myanmar’s own legal standards which require intent.' Blackwood's loved ones are fighting to help alleviate some of Blackwood's struggles during his sentence. 'He has a hole in the ground for a toilet and he has a bucket of water that he washes in, keeps himself tidy with. 'He is only given broth and rice to eat. 'I don't believe that we understand half of what he is suffering.' Mr Blackwood leaves court after being sentenced to two and half years in prison. He was found guilty of insulting Buddhism . Blackwood, the manager of VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested  after posting a promotional image of a psychedelic Buddha wearing headphones to the bar's Facebook page . Blackwood's parents worry for their son's physical and mental health, as he tries to withstand the heat and poor hygiene. They are particularly concerned as their son suffers from a chest condition and from asthma. The 32-year-old was arrested by Myanmar police in December, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up. The harsh conviction comes despite Mr and Mrs Blackwood's insistence that 'The judge's ruling that the three had 'intentionally plotted to insult religious belief' was not founded on any concrete evidence at all. 'Mr. Blackwood did not have legal representation when he was charged, nor did he have any interpreter to explain what was going on,' the petition reads. 'Three months later, they were found guilty, despite prosecution not having established intent on the side of the three accused.' A Buddhist monk tries to take a photo of New Zealander Philip Blackwood as he gets into a police vehicle outside the court . VGastro Bar employee Htut Ko Ko Lwin is escorted to a police vehicle after appearing in court in Yangon on Thursday. The trio could face two years in jail for breaching Myanmar's Religion Act . In emotional scenes after the verdict, family members of the two Myanmar defendants expressed shock and fury at the sentencing, with the mother of one exchanging barbs with a handful of nationalist monks waiting outside. The case has been watched closely by international observers amid fears that the Buddhist-majority country, which has seen a surge in foreign investment since it began emerging from the grip of the military in 2011, is seeing its much-lauded reforms stalling. The trio were also held responsible for protests that erupted outside the bar over the image. Judge Ye Lwin said that while Blackwood, 32, had posted an apology, he had 'intentionally plotted to insult religious belief' when he uploaded the photo. He added that although the New Zealander had admitted to posting the picture without intending to offend, it was also 'unreasonable only to blame the foreigner' when explaining the guilty verdicts for the Myanmar defendants. Htut Ko Ko Lwin's mother screamed at a group of monks taking photos with smartphones outside the court after the sentencing. The wife of bar owner Tun Thurein said she would consult her lawyer about appealing. 'They just decided everybody is guilty so I'm very shocked. This is very unfair,' Myat Nandar said. Blackwood made no comment as he was bundled into the back of a police truck through a scrum of media cameras. Myanmar has been rocked by several deadly outbreaks of religious violence in recent years, mainly targeting the Muslim minority. The bloodshed has coincided with the rising influence of hardline monks, who have advocated controversial new laws. Rights groups say these would severely curb the freedom of religious minorities and women. V Gastro bar, which opened just two weeks before the incident, swiftly deleted the offending image and posted this apology on its Facebook page . Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday's sentences showed 'freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever' in Myanmar, which is gearing up for crucial elections later this year. 'The authorities should accept the heartfelt public apology of the three men, vacate the conviction, and order them to be released immediately and unconditionally,' he said in a statement. Blackwood's parents told Fairfax Media from their New Zealand home that they were shocked by the decision and their son would consider an appeal. 'We hoped common sense would prevail and he would be found not guilty because it was not a malicious or intentional act...' said father Brian Blackwood. The arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country .","Philip Blackwood sentenced to two and a half years jail with hard labour .

The pop star called for a boycott of the famous brand after designer Domenico Dolce criticised in-vitro fertilization (IVF), which sparked outrage on social media. But Dolce has now insisted his views were private, personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional Sicilian family. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Designer Domenico Dolce (right) has defended his controversial remarks and said he 'respects all the world'. He is pictured with business partner Stefano Gabbana (left) Boycott: Sir Elton John (pictured with his husband David Furnish and their children), spoke out against Dolce and Gabbana and claimed that he will never wear any of their clothes ever again after their comments . In an interview with CNN, Dolce insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure, and said: 'I believe in the traditional family. 'It is impossible to change my culture for something different. It's me...I respect all the world, all the culture.' The fashion designer had previously said: 'You are born and you have a father and mother. At least it should be like that. That's why I'm not convinced by what I call chemical children, synthetic babies.' That sparked a furious reaction from John, who has two children with husband David Furnish through IVF, who fired back: 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as ""synthetic"". 'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana.' His outburst prompted a mass social media campaign, as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand. But Dolce said he would not be not boycotting the artist and added: 'I love the music of Elton John.' He said he believed they could end the dispute and added: 'Every people resolve everything by talk...we start to talk, the problem is resolved. 'Every people [has] freedom for choosing what they want. This for me is democracy. I respect you because you choose what you want. 'I respect me because I choose what I want. This just my point of private view.' Interview: Dolce made his inflammatory remarks in an interview with Italian magazine Panorama earlier this month . The fashion designer also said they respected how people chose to live their lives, including the use of IVF, and said others should also respect differences in opinion. Gabbana insisted the duo were not telling anyone how to live their lives and added: 'We love gay couple. We are gay. We love gay couple. We love gay adoption. We love everything. It's just an express of my private point of view.' And when he was if he supported having children through the in-vitro procedure, he responded: 'Yeah, I don't have anything bad, because the beauty of the world is freedom.' However, Gabbana admitted they could have expressed themselves using better language to the Italian magazine that printed the interview, but said they were shocked by the social media backlash. He added: 'Boycott Dolce & Gabbana for what? They don't think like you? This is correct? This is not correct. We are in 2015. This is like medieval. It's not correct.' Furious: Sir Elton posted a photo of design duo Dolce & Gabbana on his Instagram page and responded to their comments in a strongly-worded attack . Following John's outburst, several Hollywood celebrities tweeted their support including Ricky Martin, former tennis player Martina Navratilova and creator of TV show 'Glee,' Ryan Murphy. Victoria Beckham, a former Dolce and Gabbana ambassador who is now close friends with Sir Elton, led the outpouring of support with the message: ''Sending love to Elton David Zachary Elijah & all the beautiful IVF babies x vb.' Gabbana had fired back on social media, calling for a counter-boycott of John and defending the 'freedom to speak.'","Domenico Dolce described IVF babies as 'chemical children' and 'synthetic'

"One of the crazed gunmen who murdered 23 people during the Tunis museum massacre was at work moments before the attack and asked if he could go on his break. Yassine al-Abidi ate breakfast with his family before going to work in a Tunis travel agency. Around 10am on Wednesday he went on a break and met up with fellow terrorist Hatem Khachnaoui before the lethal attack. Friends and relatives said that al-Abidi did not appear to be a religious fanatic but Tunisian authorities said that both men travelled to Libya in September for terrorist training. Yassine al-Abidi had breakfast with his family as normal on morning he and his fellow terrorist Hatem Khachnaoui attacked the Bardo museum on Wednesday killing 23 people and injuring more than 60 others . Al-Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui pictured were both killed after a four-hour standoff with special forces . Members of al-Abidi's family mourned him at his house, with his uncle claiming that the people his nephew killed were innocent. 'Why did they have to pay the price of a false understanding of Islam . Shortly before he and a friend gunned down 23 people at Tunisia's Bardo museum, Yassine al-Abidi sat down to a breakfast of olive oil and dates with his family and left for work at his travel agency as usual. Relatives said last year al-Abidi began spending an increasing amount of time at a hard-line mosque near his home. His uncle Mohamed Abidi said: 'I am sad for Yassine, but even sadder for the victims that Yassine killed. They were innocent, why did they have to pay the price of a false understanding of Islam. 'They are the victims of terrorism. We are the victims of a demagogic network that wants only death.' Family members said al-Abidi never complained about alcohol being served his his uncle's house or express other extremist views. Terry Burton and Paula Ayres survived Wednesday's terrorist attack because they were on a taxi tour . The couple were passengers on board the MSC Splendida which docked in Barcelona yesterday morning . Sally and Brian Adey  described as ‘avid cruisers’, had been looking forward to their seven-night tour of the Mediterranean aboard MSC Splendida. Mrs Adey was murdered by the terrorists in the attack . His cousin Hanan revealed: 'He was always fun, we danced together at family weddings. He wasn't like hardline Salafists. 'On the last day he had breakfast of dates and olive oil and went to work. At 10 am he asked for a break and went and did what he did. 'He never told us not to watch television, for example.' His mother Zakia added: 'The son I knew could never do what was done.He could not even harm a bird.' Meanwhile, it has emerged that a British couple narrowly avoided getting caught up in the massacre after they decided to go on a taxi tour rather than visit the world-famous museum. The Tunisian health minister Said Aidi, visited some of the survivors recovering in hospital earlier today . Prayers were said for the victims at the Catholic cathedral of St Vincent de Paul in Tunisia earlier today . Terry Burton, 53, and Paula Ayres, 56, from King's Lynn in Norfolk were in the taxi when the driver warned them about the attack and they immediately returned to the ship. Mr Burton said they were in the city of Carthage when the news of the deadly attack was broadcast in Arabic over the radio. Translating from Arabic, their taxi driver told them what had happened before racing them back to their boat telling them: ‘it’s not safe, we need to get out of here.’ Mrs Ayres, a retired teacher, said: ‘He said “eight tourists” and then made this gesture – slitting of the throat. We had a taxi, you pay €60 and he takes you to three different places, five hours maximum. ‘He got the news off the radio. He said “we need to get back straight away”. I was very scared, I wound my window up. He insisted that we got straight back to the boat. Everywhere was closed, the roads sealed off. Overall we were very lucky to miss it all.’ Mr Burton, a carer, said: ‘You think “five minutes this way, ten minutes that way and it could have been you”.’ ‘We have survived our thoughts goes out to the families of those who didn’t.’ There were emotional scenes as passengers disembarked the MSC Splendida in Barcelona . Armed police secured the port area as the cruise ship arrived to reassure the traumatised passengers . The walls and windows were peppered with bullet holes while unused grenades lay scattered among  debris . Meanwhile it has emerged that four armed police officers tasked with protecting the Bordo museum as two terrorists attacked 'were having coffees and a snack' according to one of Tunisia's senior politicians. Abdelfattah Mourou, Vice President of the National Assembly accused four armed police officers of being absent, when in fact they should have been guarding the world-famous institution. Speaking today, Mr Mourou claimed 'two were having coffee' one was 'having a snack' and the final policeman 'could not be found'. The revelations came as hundreds of tourists returned home on board cruise ships which are continuing their Mediterranean tour. Mr Moureau said: 'This was a huge security failure. There had been talks between the army and police about security around the Parliament building the day before the attack.' The lax security revelations emerged as survivors of Wednesday's massacre returned home. There were emotional scenes in Barcelona as passengers who survived the gun attack disembarked the MSC Splendida to be greeted by family members. Some of the passengers complained they did not receive sufficient support on the vessel after the attack . It is understood that 27 people who arrived in Tunis aboard the vessel were not on board in Barcelona . Survivors said nobody was in the mood for dancing as the vessel made the 26-hour journey from Tunisia . Some of the passengers are continuing their cruise through the Mediterranean despite their ordeal . British victim Sally Adey had been onboard the MSC Splendida which docked on Wednesday in Tunis. She and her husband Robert, had boarded a bus with fellow passengers to the Bardo museum. Last night Mr Adey was preparing to fly home to England with her body. Two men, Yassine al-Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui stood outside the museum, watching as the passengers ambled off the coaches. The pair, who had been trained in Libya, raised their Kalashnikov AK47 assault rifles and fired directly at the tourists. The MSC Splendida arrived in Barcelona with 27 fewer passengers after its 26-hour journey from Tunis. Many of the passengers seemed visibly shocked as they assembled on the quayside . Passengers disembarking in Barcelona criticised the ship's crew over the 'very cold treatment' they received after their ordeal. Josep Lluis Cusido, 64, told the Spanish National news agency EFE: 'When we got back to the ship we were completely traumatised and while the other passengers applauded us as everyone was crying, we got virtually no attention from the crew. They were very cold.' Mr Cusido said the ship's captain addressed the passengers inside a theatre and apologised. However, Mr Cusido, who is a Socialist mayor of a small Spanish village said he took the microphone to make his own protest. He said: 'It was a miracle that we were alive, that we were people with feelings and not commercial objects that came to the ship just to spend money, and that we should be looked after. We were treated much better after that.' Passengers had been told prior to the trip to the Bardo Museum, they were told that Tunisia has been a democracy since 2011 and was quite safe. Mr Cusido added: 'We are recovering little by little, but there are some images we won't be able to rub-out from our lives because they were terrible...I'm still thinking about the dead who fell at my side and that I could have been one of them, because they were shooting with total coldness at the people.' Hostages flee the museum during the Tunisian special forces raid which ended in the death of both gunmen . Victoria Bronskaya, a 33-year-old tour guide from Belarus, was on a bus parked outside the National Bardo Museum in Tunis along with her mother when the attackers struck. 'We threw ourselves to the floor and they started shooting at the bus. I wasn't even afraid. You just think about saving yourself. I shouted ""God save me"" in Russian.' As she and others cowered inside, the gunmen shot two other tourists trying to board the bus. The dead bodies blocked the door of the vehicle. She added: 'That is why the terrorist could not get on board.' Ms Bronsakaya said she and her mother were trapped on board the bus for four hours before being eventually led to safety. She said: 'We only started to cry afterwards, when we saw the Tunisian people taking pity on us, saying: ""Forgive us"".' Newlyweds Francisco Buciegas and his wife Inma, from Cordoba, stepped off shocked after their honeymoon was cut short. Inma, who is four-months pregnant said: ''The whole thing was really awful. It made us really anxious. A passenger, Josefa Ramirez, from Malaga in Spain, who was on the boat with her husband Jose Pinto, said she had dined at the same table as that couple on board the Splendida. Mrs Ramierez said: 'Their children had paid for the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary. Seven hundred passengers on the Splendida ended their cruise in Barcelona, while the hundreds of others stayed on board to continue their cruise around the Mediterranean. Piot Henri from the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion said: 'It was very sad last night. Nobody was dancing.' As investigations into the massacre continue, Tunisian security officials have been asked why the world-famous museum was completely unprotected.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"It has taken $70million at box offices across the US in its opening weekend - but Cinderella is facing an online backlash over the lead character's 'unnaturally small' waist. The Disney remake of the classic fairy tale stars English actress Lily James who has revealed she was on a liquid diet at times during filming while wearing a tight-fitting corset for the role. The $95million live-action fantasy ran in to controversy even before its release date amid accusations that digital trickery had been used to alter the 25-year-old actress's waist to make it appear smaller. Scroll down for video . Actress Lily James revealed she was on a liquid diet at times during filming because she was wearing a tight-fitting corset for the role . Hitting back: Last week Miss James (pictured as Cinderella) hit out at 'upsetting' and 'boring' criticism of her tiny waist in the movie . Miss James (pictured at the World Premiere of Disney's Cinderella insisted her slim look was achieved with the use of a corset alone . This was denied by Walt Disney Pictures and the film's director 54-year-old Sir Kenneth Branagh, while a representative for Miss James insisted the look was achieved with the use of a corset alone. But the row continued on Twitter today after the movie's public release, with many people critical of just how effective the item proved to be at shrinking her waist and others even calling for fans to boycott the movie. Rochelle Schattner wrote: 'Boycott #Cinderella by Disney for making Cinderella's waist disturbing to look at and setting up unrealistic expectations.' Another Twitter user, Kyla, said: 'What I gleaned from the new Cinderella is that if you're docile and nice to rats, you too can have a waist the circumference of a Coke can.' Controversy: Twitter users have gone online to question the size of the lead character's waistline . Some have even called for fans to boycott the movie claiming Cinderella's tiny waistline sets up 'unrealistic expectations' Backlash: Some complained that Cinderella's small waist was not 'setting a positive example for girls in today's society . Others described Cinderella's waist as 'nearly non-existent' as the Twitter backlash continued over the weekend . Janelle Walker added: 'Pretty sure Lily James's corset made her waist 4 inches round in #Cinderella. Not setting a positive example for girls in today's society.' A review of the film by vox.com was also critical of Cinderella's tiny waist. 'What's crazy about this version is that Cinderella ends up with a supernaturally thin waist, thanks to a corset that James has complained wouldn't let her swallow whole foods,' the review said. 'Is it just me, or is the animated Cinderella's waist actually slightly larger? And even if it's not, it's still weird to try to get an adult human being down to cartoon proportions. 'The message seems clear. On the most magical night of her life, Cinderella's waist is size negative two.' The row continued on Twitter today with many people critical of how effective the corset proved to be at shrinking Lily James's waist . Cinderella also found success internationally as it made $62.4million overseas including $25million in China, which was a record for a March opening there. Last week Miss James hit out at 'upsetting' and 'boring' criticism of her tiny waist in the movie. The Downton Abbey actress insisted she was healthy and 'always has been' and that she 'shouldn't have to' field questions about her frame. She told E! News that she was keen to be a positive role model for girls telling the website: 'For girls growing up, sometimes I think they get the wrong idea for what women should look like. Lily James (right and left with Cinderella co-star Richard Madden) says she wants to be a positive role model for girls . 'And I think it's so important to be healthy and confident and natural. And not put too much stress on trying to be thin—I don't get the thin, thin thing at all.' Some took to Twitter over the weekend to defend Disney's portrayal of Cinderella. Shannon Ellison wrote: 'When did being thin, or wearing clothes that make your waist look small, cause this self-righteous anger and condescending pity? #Cinderella.'","Cinderella took $70m at US box office on its opening weekend .

"Danielle Pisani (pictured) was a manager at Moors Health and Beauty - but when owner Sharon Moor died Pisani began overpaying herself . A con woman who stole £17,000 from her dead best friend's business while pretending to be a shoulder to cry on to her grieving family is facing jail. Danielle Pisani, 34, of Little Clacton, Essex, was a manager at Moors Health and Beauty and best friends with owner Sharon Moor. Ms Moor, 43, died of acute pancreatitis in March 2013, eight months after a kidney transplant. Later that year Pisani began stealing from the company's accounts by overpaying herself and enjoying shopping sprees on a corporate credit card. She was finally caught out when Miss Moor's grieving mother, Freda, became suspicious. Checks on the accounts revealed Pisani had taken money and goods worth £17,738. Pisani, 34, now faces jail after she admitted six charges of fraud  at Chelmsford Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing Ms Moor's sister Jacqui Volf said: 'In the 10 years she worked with my sister, Sharon was very ill and had been in and out of Addenbrooke's Hospital. 'At times Danielle was Sharon's right hand. 'Sharon's health was so bad Danielle would have to help her out of the bath and help with other personal things. 'They were best friends.' The court heard following her death in March 2013 Ms Moor's grieving family treated Pisani to trips to London and holidays in Spain to thank her for her support running the company's two beauty salons in Clacton and Colchester. Mrs Volf added: 'When Sharon passed away Danielle helped us carry on Moors but she also helped with the grieving process. 'But all the time she was stealing from us - the effect it has had has been unbelievable.' When salon owner Sharon Moor (pictured left) died her best friend stole more than £17,000 from her business. Danielle Pisani was only found out after Ms Moor's mother Freda Moor (right) became suspicious . She said her mother had suffered as a result of the betrayal, losing three stone in weight through stress. She added: 'We would be complimenting Danielle on a new dress and all the time we would have been the ones who had bought it. 'When we looked into it further, she had been so brazen.' Pisani's lies were uncovered when Mrs Moor became suspicious about wages. Checks on the accounts revealed Pisani had been using the company credit card for shopping sprees at Ikea and Primark. Pisani (pictured) was found out when Mrs Moor became suspicious about the wage she was paying herself . The family confronted Pisani who broke down in tears and admitted her guilt to them in October last year. Freda Moor said: 'I checked the holiday wages four times and each time it said she had been overpaying herself. 'Cash had been taken out and the company card was being used in Ikea and Primark. 'At the end of the month we brought her in for a disciplinary hearing and she admitted what she had done and started crying - telling us how much she loved us all and that she had loved Sharon. 'We are a very close family and I treated her like a surrogate daughter.' Ms Moor, of Tendring, Essex, had waited four years for a donor match but within eight months of her transplant she died. Pisani admitted the charges of fraud between December 1, 2013 and October 23, 2014 at a hearing yesterday . She was granted bail and will be sentenced next month.","Danielle Pisani, 34, was a manager at her friend Sharon Moor's salon .

"A mother-of-two has shared she learned her photo was among pictures kept by a serial killer while watching a History Channel documentary, she has revealed. The woman, only identified as 'Mo', was stunned to see the image that her former neighbor, Lonnie Franklin, Jr., had taken of her on the television. The image had been among scores of photos of other women found in his possession when he was arrested in 2010. She then learned that Franklin had been accused of carrying out  10 killings across the Los Angeles area over two decades and was known as 'the Grim Sleeper'. He goes on trial this June. Speaking to ABC7, Mo said she was lucky to be alive following an incident with him in 2006. Scroll down for video . Shock: Mo said she was stunned when she saw her photo on a documentary about her former neighbor . She said Franklin had seemed friendly when they lived beside each other and took a photo of the then-26-year-old outside her home - the image that later showed up among police files. One evening, he asked her to go for a ride in his van and, thinking they were friends, she agreed. But while on the journey he asked to take photos of her naked and showed her other images he had taken of women, she told ABC7. 'When he showed me the pictures I asked him why are they in weird positions, and they look dead,' she said. 'He told me they wasn't, that's just how he have them take pictures.' She said she then noticed a gun and van inside the van so she agreed to the pictures, fearing he would hurt her if she did not. After the incident, she told no one because she was embarrassed about the images and she forced the thought from her mind - until she watched the documentary over the weekend. 'When my picture popped up it was like, ""Oh my God!"" It was shocking,' she said. Chilling: Her picture (circled) was among images of other women believed to have fallen victim to Lonnie Franklin. Jr., who has been accused of 10 murders. The images were all found in his possession . Photo: She posed for the image for Franklin when she was his neighbor in Los Angeles in 2006 . Mo, whose image was among photos of other women who are feared to be his victims, added that she believes she also could have been killed by him. 'He's a monster,' she told ABC7. She has been in contact with the Los Angeles Police Department, who are looking into her story. Franklin, 62, has has pleaded not guilty to ten counts of murder and one count of attempted murder and will stand trial on June 29, it was announced last month following years of delays. Franklin could face the death penalty if convicted of the murder between 1985 and 2007. He was given the nickname 'Grim Sleeper' because of the gap between slayings in 1988 and 2002. Police arrested Franklin in July 2010 after his DNA was connected to more than a dozen crime scenes. They had linked the crimes, but did not have a suspect until a crime lab computer traced the sample to one of Franklin's family members. Accused: Franklin, 62, pictured in court in Los Angeles last month, will go on trial on June 29 this year . Probe: A 2010 photo shows items being removed from his home after his DNA matched with cold cases . An officer posing as a busboy at a pizza parlor got DNA samples from dishes and utensils Franklin had been eating with at a birthday party. As news of the trial date has been announced, attorney Nina Salarno Ashford, a board member of Crime Victims United, said it is not unusual for capital cases to take years to complete. Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman said the case has been plagued by delays and that the judge has failed to hold the defense to strict deadlines to complete their investigation. But defense lawyer Seymour Amster blamed the prosecution, and said his expert found DNA from another man at three of the crime scenes and is seeking to test more material. A firearms expert who tested guns retired last year, so the testing needed to be done again, while medical examiners at the coroner's office have retired and will also need to be replaced.

"A two-year-old California boy who was born paralyzed from the waist down has been denied a wheelchair from his parent's insurance company. Aubrey and Joe Allred, the parents of toddler Crue, said they wanted their son to have a new wheelchair, however Anthem Blue Cross refused to grant him one because he is too young. Aubrey said she was also told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old. Crue, who was born with spina bifida, currently gets around in a $1,100 ZipZac, which is a miniature wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk. Scroll down for video . A California boy, two, who was born paralyzed from the waist down has been denied a wheelchair from his parent's insurance company which would allow him to be more independent (above Crue Allred) Aubrey (right) and Joe Allred (center), the parents of toddler Crue (left), said they wanted their son to have a wheelchair, however, Anthem Blue Cross has refused to grant him one because he is too young. Aubrey said she was told he would be eligible when he is five years old . Aubrey, 29, a mother-of-two, said she is heartbroken because she believes her son should have the freedom to be independent,  according to Fox News. The family submitted a claim for a wheelchair which was rejected in October. They resubmitted the claim which was also rejected a few weeks ago. On March 3, Aubrey wrote on Facebook that the claim had been denied. She wrote: 'I know that our son is only two but his mobility shouldn't be determined by a doctor that works for the insurance company, who has never met him. 'Crue is such an amazing and determined little boy and is capable of a lot more than they think. I don't know where he would be without his little ZipZac chair. That chair has given him his own independence and the ability to explore and learn on his own. 'He's been using that chair for almost two years now (no thanks to the insurance). I just wish that insurance companies would understand that if they gave young disabled children the chance to have mobility at a young age, the difference they'd be making in their lives. 'An able child learns to walk at the age of one so why is it not okay for a young disabled child to learn to use a chair at the age of two?' Crue, who was born with spina bifida, currently gets around in a $1,100 ZipZac, which is a small wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk (Crue pictured above in his ZipZac wheelchair) Anthem Blue Cross has said the child's doctor is at fault for not submitting the required documents ahead of the legal deadline. 'Our records reflect that claim was denied because their doctor, despite efforts by Anthem to obtain this information, did not provide necessary documentation before the legal deadline to process a claim expired,' Darrel Ng, spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross told Fox News. The insurance company also said the family can appeal the decision that the chair is not necessary for Crue, according to ABC. The toddler's parents plan to appeal the decision and keep fighting for their son. Insurance company, Anthem Blue Cross, said the child's doctor is at fault for submitting the required documents in a timely fashion (above, Crue pictured in February during his routine kidney and bladder check up) Crue's parents plan to appeal the decision given by the insurance company and will keep fighting for their son (above Crue pictured in January enjoying sled hockey) Aubrey began sharing her son's story on Facebook, which led a close friend of theirs to start a donation page to help raise funds so that Crue could have a new wheelchair. As their friend, Chanda Clark Steggell, was only intending to raise $10,000, by Saturday $15,995 had been raised in donations. Now Crue will also be able to have a standing walker and standing wheelchair. The donations will also help with many other of his other medical needs that are incurred on both a weekly and monthly basis. Since Aubrey shared her son's story on Facebook, which led a close friend to help raise nearly $16,000 by Saturday. Now Crue will get a new wheelchair, as well as a standing walker and a standing wheelchair (above the Facebook post thanking people for generous donations) Aubrey said she gets teary-eyed thinking about all of the donations, and that she along with Joe are determined to show Crue that he can do whatever he wants in life (above Aubrey and Joe) 'This little boy is beyond shocked and so grateful for all the donations he has gotten,' a recent Facebook post said. 'He just wants to thank each and every one of you for all you love, support, prayers, and kind words. 'We are truly blessed to have such amazing people in our lives.' Aubrey said she gets teary-eyed thinking about all of the donations, and that she along with Joe are determined to show Crue that he can do whatever he wants in life.","Crue Allred, two, was born with spina bifida, and currently gets around in a miniature wheelchair that gets stuck on cracks in sidewalk .

"A deaf boy believed to be 11 years old went on an overnight joyride in his mom's car, driving 20 miles through Oklahoma City before crashing into a curb. The boy snuck out of his home in Moore, in the southwest end of the city, only to end up on the northwest end at about 5.30am. When a driver spotted the boy, who has not been named, running around and the 2012 Kia sedan crashed into bushes, he called 911. An deaf boy believed to be 11 years old went on a 20-mile in his mom's car that ended when he crashed into a curb on the northwest end of Oklahoma City . Police said that the boy snuck out of his house while his parents were sleeping and found himself 20 miles away at 5.30am . Because the boy has a hearing impairment, police had trouble communicating with him. They are unsure as to what his exact route was . To call it a crash, however, would 'almost be an overstatement', Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Gary Knight told the New York Daily News. There was minimal damage to the car, and the boy simply 'drove up the curb and bumped into decorative rocks', the sergeant said. Police said that the boy was not injured and he was standing next to the car when officers arrived. He would have been driving for approximately 25 minutes to end up where he did, according to New York Daily News, but police told KWTV that they are unsure as to what route he took. Police did, however, find out contact information for the boy's parents. His mother (pictured right) spoke in sign language to her son at the scene . Police said that calling it a crash was 'almost be an overstatement', as he only hit decorative rocks and was not injured . Police had trouble communicating with the boy because of his disability, and at one point they were using hand-written notes to converse. When his parents arrived on scene they communicated through sign language.

"Sir Jeremy Heywood, nicknamed 'Sir Cover-Up' has overseen a move that will ban civil servants from speaking to journalists without prior approval . A ban on civil servants talking to journalists without prior ministerial approval will ‘intimidate’ them into silence, critics said last night. The Civil Service Code has been revised, with the threat that officials could be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister. A line has been added to the code, saying: ‘Ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media.’ As well as raising concerns about the transparency of government, there are fears the revision could dissuade whistleblowers from coming forward – meaning scandals could go undetected. The move, which follows a similar clampdown on members of the armed forces talking to the media, has been overseen by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Head of the Home Civil Service. He has been nicknamed ‘Sir Cover-Up’ for preventing the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War from seeing letters and records of phone calls between Tony Blair and George Bush. His influence is such that David Cameron is said to have once joked: ‘Remind me, Jeremy, do you work for me or do I work for you?’ A source at the Cabinet Office – which is in charge of the Civil Service – insisted the move was an attempt to increase ministers’ accountability of civil servants in their department. Francis Maude, Cabinet Office minister, promised to ensure that the right of whistleblowers would be maintained. But Dave Penman of the FDA union, which represents Whitehall officials, said the move was an ‘unnecessary, unworkable and unjustified restriction’. ‘The public has a right to open and transparent public services, yet this change now requires ministerial authorisation before a civil servant can respond or make any contact with the media – from a prosecutor being asked for comment outside of court, to a job centre manager dealing with a local news story,’ he added. ‘Guidance to regulate contact between civil servants and the media is already in place and we can see no justification for this sudden, drastic change, other than intimidating civil servants into silence … this knee-jerk decision seems to have only been made to sate unfounded and misguided ministerial mistrust.’ Mark Serwotka, of the Public and Commercial Services Union, said the ban was an attempt to ‘prevent public servants from telling the truth about government policy, by a minister who has already admitted he wants to do as much damage as possible before he steps down by making his reforms “irreversible”’. Francis Maude, Cabinet Office minister, promised that the right of whistleblowers would be maintained . The extension to the Civil Service Code means the Government has effectively ordered more than 400,000 people not to talk to reporters without its approval. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said the rule ‘clarifies’ an existing requirement that civil servants must ‘clear material for publication in advance’. He added: ‘There is no change to the important rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation which is protected by statute.’ In a letter to the FDA union, Mr Maude said he proposes to include ‘a footnote referencing the whistleblowing legislation within the revised Code’.","Ban prevents civil servants from talking to journalists without approval .

"These shocking pictures show the inside of a squalid drug den littered with needles and packs of methadone in the Cornish town where Poldark is set. The disgusting images of a flat in Bodmin were taken after a woman and her boyfriend were evicted, leaving behind drug paraphernalia, condoms and piles of rubbish. The state of the property paints a darker picture of a town better known for being where the 18th century historical romance was set. Needles and drug paraphernalia were found among the debris at a squalid flat in Bodmin, where Poldark was set . The disgusting images of a flat in Bodmin were taken after a woman and her boyfriend were evicted, leaving behind mouldy food, condoms and piles of rubbish . The state of the property paints a darker picture of a town better known for being where the 18th century historical romance was set . Crisp packets, empty fizzy drinks cans and plastic bags litter the floors of the squalid flat in the Cornish town . Bodmin, also known for its legendary beast, was where Poldark was set during its 1970s television adaptation . The grim photographs show debris piled up against the walls, with the floors of the heroin and crack cocaine den covered in needles, mouldy food and cigarette butts. The popular 1970s adaptations of the Poldark novels were set in the town, and a new BBC series based on the romantic novels was also filmed on Bodmin Moor. The first seven novels, set in the 18th centuries, tell the story of a Ross Poldark, a British Army officer who returns from the American Revolutionary War to find his fiancee, presuming he was dead, about to marry his cousin. The next five books focus on the children of the main characters and is largely set in the 19th century. Widely considered to be the one of the most successful television adaptations, Poldark is set to return to the BBC on Sunday with a new series. Many will be hoping the series encourages more tourists to the town, but the photographs from inside the drug den show it is not idyllic as the television programme makes it appear.

Despite obvious drug use in the house, police did not arrest the tenants after they were kicked out . The 1970s adaptation of Poldark, starring Angharad Rees (right) and Robin Ellis (left), was set in the town . The new series, which starts on Sunday and features Aiden Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson, was also filmed on Bodmin Moor . The two-bedroom flat's landlord Charlie Besenyi, 77, called the police after evicting the pair but was told that officers would not be able to help any further. He said: 'It was disgusting. I had never seen anything like it in my life. I was a good Samaritan and tried to help this woman who was living on the streets and she gave me a £125 a week through housing benefit. 'She stayed for five months with her boyfriend and the flat turned into a drug supermarket. There were always coming and goings and I knew something dodgy was going on. 'I have lived in Bodmin for 40 years and Cornwall is a beautiful place and I love it here. But it does have a darker side and a big problem with drugs that people on the outside probably don't realise. 'Show like Poldark show off Cornwall in a fantastic light which is good for the area. But what has happened here proves that the reality is somewhat different. 'I think this would shock a lot of people, which think of Cornwall as what they see on the television. Bodmin is full of druggies.' Kitchen surfaces were found smeared with grease inside the flat in Bodmin, which is tackling a drug problem . Many will be hoping the Poldark series encourages more tourists to the town, but photographs from inside the drug den show it is not idyllic as the television programme makes it appear . The landlord said Bodmin has a recognised drug problem and that dealers regularly target the town . Dirty clothes were piled up against the walls alongside rubbish, overflowing bins and unwashed pans . Shocking: One of the windows of the flat was smashed when the landlord evicted his tenants . 'After I evicted this woman and her boyfriend I opened the door and I was shocked. They ripped up everything and there was stuff everywhere. It has been disastrous.' There were more than 60 crimes involving drugs in Bodmin in the last year, as well as more than 700 anti-social behaviour offences and nearly 200 reports of criminal damage. A spokesman for tourist board Visit Cornwall said: 'Everywhere has its issues and there are always two sides to every story but Cornwall is incredibly beautiful with a stunning natural landscape and this is showcased wonderfully in the Poldark adaptation. 'The series is expected to offer Cornwall a real boost in terms of tourism which will provide a positive impact on the local economy.'","Disgusting pictures show the inside of drug den in Cornish town of Bodmin .

"A momentous and valuable piece of our evolutionary history has gone on display to the public. The 2.8 million-year-old partially complete lower jaw, uncovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the Homo family. It is significant because it suggests our first human ancestors emerged 400,000 years earlier than previously thought. The fossil is now encased in a glass box at the Arizona University. Scroll down for video . The 2.8 million-year-old partially complete lower jaw (pictured), uncovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the Homo family. The fossilised remains were put on display inside a glass case at Arizona University earlier this week . It was unveiled at a press conference by  Professor Kaye Reed, one of the palaeontologists who made the discovery in January 2013. Scientists say the fossil, which is known as LD 350-1, is recognisably human but also has more primitive features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the Homo family. This would make it the common ancestor for modern humans - Homo sapiens - and their extinct relatives including Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Neanderthals. Researchers who have digitally reconstructed the jaws of other ancient human ancestors say the fossil also matches what they would expect from this common ancestor. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's . 2.8 million years ago - LD 350-1 appeared and may be the first of the Homo family . 2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing . 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa . 1.8 million years ago - Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record . 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation . 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly . 400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia . 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa . 40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe . The discovery, which was found in the Ledi-Geraru area of Afar, has put a new date on the emergence of the first 'man' from our more ape-like ancestors. Dr Brian Villmoare, from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, helped lead the fossil hunters, said: 'In spite of a lot of searching, fossils on the Homo lineage older than two million years ago are very rare. 'To have a glimpse of the very earliest phase of our lineage’s evolution is particularly exciting. 'LD 350-1 reveals that many of the anatomical patterns we see in 2 million-year old Homo were established much earlier in the evolution of the genus. 'At 2.8 million years ago we see relatively evolved Homo traits in combination with other much more primitive anatomical features.' The researchers, whose work on the fossil is published in the journal Science, say the fossil could be a key missing link between the Homo lineage and a more primitive and ape-like rival branch of the hominin evolutionary tree called Australopithecus. Details of the Australopithecus are best known from a fossil named ‘Lucy’, dating back 3.2 million years, which was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. But exactly how Homo habilis had appeared was unclear due to a huge gap in the fossil record. The new discovery has helped to fill that gap. Scientists say it can provide important clues to the changes in jaw and teeth that distinguished members of the Homo family from those belonging to Australopithecus. Until now the earliest evidence of the existence of the first Homo species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million year old fossils. Scientists have been searching for decades for earlier examples in an attempt to understand how our ancestors split from other ape-like hominins. Dr William Kimbel, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University who was also involved in the research, said: 'The Ledi jaw helps narrow the evolutionary gap between Australopithecus and early Homo. 'It’s an excellent case of a transitional fossil in a critical time period in human evolution.' The bone was unveiled at a press conference by Professor Kaye Reed (pictured), one of the palaeontologists who made the discovery in January 2013. Scientists say the fossil, known as LD 350-1, is recognisably human but also has more primitive features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the Homo family . The fossilised lower jawbone, shown above with teeth still in the bone, was found in Ledi-Geraru in Ethiopia . The fossilised jawbone was first discovered by student Chalachew Seyoum from the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage in Ethiopia in January 2013. Until now, the earliest evidence of the existence of the first Homo species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million-year-old fossils. The jawbone is pictured . It is thought to be the left side of an adult's lower jawbone that has canine, premolars and three molars still preserved in the jaw. Mr Seyoum said he was ‘stunned’ when he saw the fossil. ‘The moment I found it, I realised that it was important, as this is the time period represented by few fossils in Eastern Africa,’ he told BBC News last night. Dating of the fossil and the surrounding sediment suggest it is between 2.8 million and 2.75 million years old. Other fossils of antelope, prehistoric elephants and hippos discovered alongside the jawbone suggest that this early Homo species lived in open grassland and shrub habitats. This matches the picture that scientists believe was occurring around this time of climate change creating increasingly arid conditions in Africa. These are thought to be one of the main driving forces that led to the evolution of the Homo lineage and eventually our own species. Australopithecus, by contrast, was thought to inhabit far wetter environments and this may have contributed to their eventual demise. The researchers said that the changes in the new jawbone compared to Australopithecus suggest that evolution of different jaw shapes may have been a key step in the divergence of the two lineages. Professor Kaye Reed, also from Arizona State University, said: 'We can see the 2.8 million year aridity signal in the Ledi-Geraru faunal community, but it’s still too soon to say that this means climate change is responsible for the origin of Homo.' The images above show the jawbone from different angles and how many of the teeth still remain in place . Anthropologists digging tin the Ledi-Geraru, pictured above, discovered the new jawbone in January 2013 . The new fossil has helped fill a huge gap in the evolutionary history (above) of how the Homo family appeared . Another study published in the journal Nature has also provided convincing evidence that LD 350-1 was a common human ancestor to the Homo family. The jawbone was found in the Ledi-Geraru area, marked with a star on the map above, of Ethiopia . They used 3D imaging techniques to scan partial skull of Homo habilis - a human ancestor that lived 1.8 million years ago and is thought to have been among the first to use tools - earning it the nickname 'handy man'. It reveals an unexpectedly primitive structure, indicating that the species may have originated at least 2.3 million years ago and allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about what their ancestors jaw would have looked like. Their findings suggest that three different species of early human existed side-by-side between 2.1 million and 1.6 million years ago - Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Homo rudolfensis. Scientists used 3D imaging techniques to reconstruct the skull of Homo hablis (left) which has provided clues about how this now extinct member of our evolutionary branch would have looked. The image on the right shows an early reconstruction of Homo hablis at the Westfälisches Museum for Archaology in Herne . They found that the ancestor of Homo habilis would have had features similar to those found in the fossilised jawbone LD 350-1. Professor Fred Spoor, a researcher of evolutionary anatomy at University College London and the Max Planck Institute in Germany, said: 'By digitally exploring what Homo habilis really looked like we could infer the nature of its ancestor, but no such fossils were known. 'Now the Ledi-Geraru jaw has turned up as if ‘on request’, suggesting a plausible evolutionary link between Australopithecus afarensis and Homo habilis.' This reconstruction of the jaw of Homo habilis by the UCL team shows that it was more primitive than the jaws of Homo erectus or Homo sapiens and was more similar to the jaw of  Australopithecus afarensis . Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said the discovery of LD 350-1 could help scientists unravel the complex beginnings of our own species. He said: 'It gives us a better understanding of what was happening at the earlier end of the genus Homo. 'Finds like Kenyanthropus (a 3.5 million year old ape-like species) have made it harder to understand the relationship between the Australopithecines and us - in short it’s the replacement of the old fashioned unilinear model of a evolutionary branch with a multiple species based evolutionary bush. 'What’s becoming clear is that we have only a small part of the jigsaw puzzle. This new fossil may well be a member of our genus, an australopithecine or an hitherto unknown genus.'","Jawbone - known as LD 350-1 - was discovered in Afar region of Ethiopia .

"Jailed: Kye Green has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for kidnapping his girlfriend . A jealous boyfriend tied his girlfriend to a radiator and threatened to carve his initials in her face with a razor blade because he thought she was being unfaithful. Kye Green, who has been convicted of more than 100 crimes, was jailed for two and a half years for kidnapping Jade Kershaw and keeping her prisoner for an hour. He tied the terrified woman to a gas pipe and a radiator, and she only managed to escape by cutting her restraints with a penknife and climbing out of the window. Green, 26, became notorious when he was one of the first people get an Asbo in 2003, when he was just 14. He has since racked up 102 convictions, with the latest coming at Grimsby Crown Court this week, when Green admitted kidnapping Miss Kershaw, 20, in August last year. Jeremy Evans, prosecuting, told the court that the pair had been in a relationship for about six months, and they were living together at the time. On August 15, they began arguing and he slapped her. Over the next few days, he bombarded her Facebook account with about 75 messages, some of them threatening, but she agreed to meet him near B&Q in Grimsby. There he pushed her against a wall and held a razor blade near her face, the court heard. 'He accused her of being unfaithful and, despite her denials, told her he would carve his initial in her face to remind her of him every time she looked at her own reflection,' said Mr Evans. 'He told her that no one else would be allowed to be with her.' After he punched her twice in the face she agreed to go with him to their house in Grimsby, and he said he would slit her throat then kill himself if anyone else turned up. 'He produced an iron bar - part of a bicycle seat - from his right sleeve and told her she was lucky he had not used it to assault her,' said Mr Evans. Home: Green tied up Jade Kershaw at the house they shared on this street in Grimsby . At the house, he tied her legs together and used a penknife to tear bindings from an old flag. 'He bound her hands behind her back but she realised that the bindings were loose,' said Mr Evans. 'He threatened her that if she were to escape, it would ""be worse"" when he caught her. He told her that she was fortunate that he was not locking her inside the upstairs cupboard.' Green went out to buy some cigarettes and tied a length of cloth from her feet to a gas pipe, as well as two more pieces to attach the knee bindings to the radiator. He told her: 'I'm sorry I am doing this but I don't trust you. I know you will leave.' After he left, Miss Kershaw realised she was locked inside the house but managed to free her hands and used the knife to cut loose her bindings. A male friend arrived later and she was able to climb out through a window. The victim suffered injuries including a cut lip, bruising and a cut to her cheek, a sore tooth and swelling to her ankles. 'Jade Kershaw was petrified during the incident and said she has ""never felt so scared in my whole life"",' added Mr Evans. 'At times, she could hardly breathe and she did not know what the defendant would do next.' Meeting: The pair initially met up at the Grimsby branch of B&Q before Green started threatening the woman . Green had burned clothes and shoes belonging to her. These were found behind the property. His past offences included attempted robbery and assaults on prison officers in a young offenders' institution. Russell Davies, mitigating, said it was a 'terrifying' incident and the use of a razor blade to threaten to carve Miss Kershaw's face was 'particularly terrifying' for her. 'He believed genuinely that this young girl had started another relationship,' said Mr Davies. They were 'once in love' but he became 'desperate' because he was losing her, he added. After the hearing, the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'This man presents a serious and significant risk of harm to women. 'He is a violent, domestic abuser who intimidated his victim and sought to assert ultimate control over her when she ended their relationship. 'The victim displayed great courage and presence of mind in managing to escape from this situation and report the matter to the police.'","Kye Green kidnapped girlfriend Jade Kershaw and accused her of cheating .

"The president of the University of Virginia has questioned whether the Virginia liquor agency should be able to arrest students, following the fallout from black  student Martese Johnson's brutal arrest. Teresa A. Sullivan said the agency's top priority should be to ensure that people who hold liquor licenses adhere to the law adding 'getting arrested shouldn't involved getting stitches.' Video of the student's bloody arrest by officers was shared on social media and sparked protests on campus after he was seen lying on the ground, hands tied, saying 'I go to UVA, I go to UVA.' Scroll down for video . Questions: UVA president Teresa A. Sullivan, pictured, said the Alcoholic Beverage Control should be to ensure that people who hold liquor licenses adhere to the law and not leaving people needing stitches . Hurt: Lawmakers are calling for change after the fallout from black student Martese Johnson's brutal arrest, seen here, as he lay bloody on the pavement after the scuffle with officers in the early hours of Wednesday . Scene: The incident  occurred as Johnson stood outside Trinity Irish Pub just blocks from the campus but the venue has denied racially profiling patrons in a statement . The 20-year-old, wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt and pink top could also be heard saying: 'How did this happen, you fuc**** racists.' Johnson, a Chicago native who is majoring in Italian and Media Studies, was arrested by Virginia's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) at 12:45 a.m. Wednesday. Cops swooped in and arrested the student - who could be seen on video bleeding profusely - after he was accused of trying to get into Trinity Irish Pub, near campus with a fake ID. Following widespread condemnation of the footage, Sullivan, along with several high-profile lawmakers in Virginia are now calling for a reexamination of ABC's arrest powers. She told The Washington Post: 'As to the other issues, like having a fake ID and underage drinking and son on – both Charlottesville and university police do arrest people for that.' Sullivan is backed by Marcus L. Martin, UVA's vice president and chief officer for diversity and equity. He said he spoke with Johnson, and he was not intoxicated when he was arrested. On Wednesday night, hundreds of students gathered at the University of Virginia campus to demand justice for Johnson. There was also a separate march through the town . Support: Marcus L.

State House Minority Leader David Toscano, right, called the image of the arrest 'very disturbing' Johnson, pictured left, is an honor student at the university, which has seen a string of controversies this year . But video of Johnson's bloodied face, caused by a gash to his head led House Minority Leader David Toscano to call the arrest 'very disturbing.' Meanwhile, Senator Donald McEachin has added his voice to the chorus of disapproval over ABC's   arrest powers. He now wants to consider sponsoring legislation that would give state police jurisdiction of the state's alcohol laws. Johnson, an honor student was charged with public intoxication and or swearing and obstruction of justice for the St Patrick's Day night incident outside the Trinity Irish Pub. He was released Wednesday morning. Protests erupted at the campus following the arrest. On Wednesday night, a thousand students gathered on the prestigious campus to demand justice for their classmate. It has also emerged that contrary to officers' suspicions, Johnson did not have a fake ID and had presented his real identification when a bar employee asked to see it, according to his friend. His roommate Joshua Kinlaw said: 'So the ID that he actually showed to both the bouncer and to the ABC [Alcoholic Beverage Control] officers was his real ID. 'Now because the age on that ID shows him to be 20 years old, I think that's when dispute and discrepancies came in.' Johnson, seen here on Thursday, was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice. He said through his lawyer, right, that he was 'shocked that my face was slammed into the brick pavement' Defense: Joshua Kinlaw, left, pictured speaking to ABC News, said  the ID that Johnson actually showed to both the bouncer and to the ABC was his real ID, but the zip code he gave was for his mother's, right, address rather than the one listed on the ID he gave to Alcoholic Beverage Control officers . On Thursday, his lawyer, Daniel Watkins, backed these claims and said that the student was simply standing on the sidewalk when officers approached him. This led Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a state police investigation into the arrest. Additionally, Attorney General Mark R. Herring said he is now considering a review of arrest data to determine if there was any racial bias involved from the law enforcement agencies. But in a statement, Trinity Irish Pub, (the establishment that Johnson tried to get in) said managers refute claims made by a former employee that staff were instructed to  racially profile. The statement, obtained by WVIR-TV said: 'There have been reports that Trinity engages or engaged, in this incident, in racial profiling in not permitting Mr. Johnson to enter. 'The rationale for allowing patrons to enter — being familiar with the zip code on their own license — is color, gender, race, and ethnicity-blind. 'Comments made by a previous employee by the name of Dante DeVito that Trinity instructs its management to scrutinize persons of color for entry, are patently false. 'Mr. DeVito was employed by Trinity for six months and was terminated by management for cause. His comments are those of a disgruntled former employee and are not accurate.' The pub also said that Johnson was turned away after he gave an incorrect zip code to go with his ID. Yet, the student later said that he gave the ZIP code of the address where his mother currently lives rather than the one listed on the ID he gave to Alcoholic Beverage Control officers. The legal drinking age in Virginia is 21 years old and Johnson has maintained his innocence saying he was not intoxicated, according to CNN. Johnson said his 'head lay bloody, but unbowed.' And: 'One thought raced through my mind: How could this happen?'","President Teresa A. Sullivan said the agency's priority should be to ensure that people who hold liquor licenses adhere to the law .

"Britain's biggest pensions firm has come under fire for exploiting savers after dishing out £49million in pay and perks to its bosses last year. With less than a week before the biggest shake-up in the pensions market for more than a century, insurance giant Prudential was last night accused of ‘greed’ after revealing the extraordinary awards lavished on its senior executives. MPs and pension experts said the scale of the awards would be particularly galling for millions of savers trapped in poor-value annuities or paying excessive charges. Tidjane Thiam (left), the Pru’s Ivorian chief executive, was the highest paid board member, but this was dwarfed by the £15.4million scooped by fund manager Richard Woolnough (right) Tidjane Thiam, the Pru’s Ivorian chief executive, was the highest paid board member, with a total package of £11.8million last year – a 36 per cent pay rise from the £8.7million he received the previous year. This takes the total amount he has collected in five years at the helm to more than £41million. The 52-year-old announced his resignation earlier this month and will shortly become chief executive of Credit Suisse. But his pay was dwarfed by the £15.4million scooped by fund manager Richard Woolnough – who runs almost £35billion of savers’ money for the Pru’s investment arm M&G. Mr Woolnough runs several funds which are widely held in savers’ pensions and investment ISAs. These include the M&G Optimal Income fund, which runs just under £24billion of savers’ money. Prudential’s nine board directors shared a total of £49million in pay and perks last year. Mike Wells, the boss of the insurer’s US arm and the man expected to take over from Mr Thiam, was paid £11.4million. Last night Dr Ros Altmann, a leading pensions expert and a government adviser for older workers, accused Prudential of ‘short-changing’ savers who took out annuities by offering poor rates. Tidjane Thiam, the Pru’s Ivorian chief executive, was the highest paid board member, with a total package of £11.8million last year . She said: ‘Over the last few years Prudential has been one of the worst culprits, offering poor annuity rates. 'I would imagine that any saver short-changed in one of its annuities would feel most uncomfortable to know the extra profit this company has made on their retirement fund has helped bump up the pay for its top bosses to a figure they could only dream of earning in a lifetime.’ Today a 65-year-old man with a £100,000 pensions pot would receive an annual income of just £3,899 from a Prudential annuity. This is more than £400 less per year than they would get if they shopped around for the best deal. Earlier this year an investigation by the City watchdog found the £12billion-a-year annuity market is not working well for customers, with millions of people trapped in poor deals. John Mann, a Labour member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘Savers and particularly pensioners will be incredibly angry at this greed which comes at their expense. The failure in annuities demonstrates why such obscene pay is out of order.’ The payouts are bigger than those handed out to Britain’s biggest banks, which have been the primary focus of anger over fat-cat pay. Lloyds’ chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio was comfortably the highest-paid bank boss in the UK last year, scooping £11.5million. Stuart Gulliver of HSBC was next in the pecking order with £7.6million. In comparison, highly paid pensions bosses have largely managed to avoid the limelight. But the increasingly fierce criticism of the pensions industry – including accusations of excessive charges and poor annuity rates for savers – has contributed to growing criticism over pay. Last night Prudential defended the huge payouts. It said profits at the company jumped 14 per cent last year to £3.2billion, while it paid out £945million in dividends to shareholders, a 10 per cent jump on the previous year. A spokesman said: ‘The remuneration of our leadership team is closely linked to the strong long-term performance of the business.’","Prudential dished out £49million in pay and perks to its bosses last year .

"A popular YouTube beauty guru has come under fire from her viewers after she revealed that she uses her nursing friend's breast milk as a homeopathic remedy for combating eye infections . Jackie Aina, who runs the YouTube channel Makeup Game On Point, shared her bizarre trick for treating eye infections, including pink eye, in a recent video about her favorite beauty hacks - but not all of her 400,000 followers approved of her suggestion that people should put someone else's bodily fluid in their eyes. 'That hack can actually be very dangerous,' one of the video's 450 commenters wrote. 'Breast milk is a bodily fluid that can transmit many infections/diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, CMV, some Herpes viruses and more.' Strange cure: Beauty vlogger Jackie Aina from Makeup Game On Point revealed that she used her friend's breast milk to treat a recent eye infection . Beauty hack: Jackie can be seen demonstrating how she used a cotton swab to put three or four drops of breast milk in her eye per day until the infection was gone . The critic continued: 'Regardless of how close a friendship between you and a friend, you can never be fully aware of all the details of their medical history, so I would strongly advise against it.' In response, Jackie noted that she never suggested people should take breast milk from strangers. 'This was not at all some random chick I went to high school with,' she explained. 'The precautions are something everyone should take heed to but I definitely know better.' She continued: 'I care about my subscribers way too much to just put irresponsible information out there like that, however, if someone does not utilize good judgment on things like this it is not at the responsibility of the YouTuber.' But her explanation failed to convince her critics, with a second person adding: 'There has GOT TO be another option than breast milk... like come on.' 'Ummm of course there is another option than breast milk,' Jackie replied. 'But it works and is efficient.' And while her beauty trick may not have gone down well with all of her viewers, some of Jackie's fans were happy to defend her and her advice. Odd request: Jackie said she asked she asked her nursing friend for a small amount of her breast milk after she researched natural remedies on the internet . 'Come on people. Just stop with the ""breast milk is a bodily fluid"". I'm pretty sure most of us know that. These are just some tips that [Jackie] was trying to share with us from her experience,' one woman wrote. She added: 'You don't HAVE to do any of them. If you don't agree, then don't try any of them. Simple.' In the video, Jackie noted that it was an 'odd' form of treatment that she discovered when she found herself in a desperate situation. 'I am just a huge believer,' she said. 'The body is supposed to heal itself in some ways - in a lot of ways actually.' She continued: 'I will always go for a natural method before anything [else] when it comes to stuff like that.' Jackie came across the remedy when she started to develop an eye infection just days before she was supposed to travel. Many uses: A mother can be seen breast feeding her baby. In addition to supposedly treating eye ear infections, it has been claimed that breast milk is a natural solution for skin conditions such as acne . 'Not to sound vain, but the way that I look is everything,' she explained. 'I need to be on point 24/7. For something like an eye infection, that could put me out of commission.' She admitted that because she didn't have didn't have time to find a doctor to treat her, she began searching the internet for natural remedies to clear up her eye swelling. Breast milk can supposedly treat eye and ear infections when applied to the infected area with a dropper . People also use it as a contact lens solution because of its anti-bacterial properties . Gargling with breast milk can allegedly cure a sore throat . It has been used as a body ointment for the treatment of burning, itching and stinging of skin . Breast milk can be used as a facial cleanser with claims that is a natural solution for acne and other skin disorders such as eczema . It has been used as a substitute for cow's milk in coffee and cereal . And according to Jackie, breast milk was the first solution to come up. She soon called her nursing friend and asked for some of her breast milk. 'Yo this is awkward. I need some pumps, I need some calcium girl. Hook it up,' she said of her conversation with the new mother. After her friend gave her a small amount of breast milk, Jackie used a clean cotton swab to apply it to her eye area three or four times daily. 'The next day the swelling that started was starting to appear in my eye went away completely,' she said. 'It never came back honey,' she added. 'Get you some breast milk.' Breast milk has also become the latest trend in skincare. Mud Facial Bar in Chicago is planning to offer clients breast milk facials with the claim that it can help sooth conditions such as acne and eczema because of its anti-bacterial properties. 'Human breast milk has a lot of antibodies in it that helps fight infection, and since acne is an infection of the skin, that is one that it helps fight,' Spa owner Shama Patel told Daily Mail Australia. 'Additionally, it helps with sun burn, eczema, wrinkles and making the skin's overall appearance smoother.'","Jackie Aina revealed her alleged cure for eye infections in a recent video about her favorite beauty hacks .

"This is the horrific moment a thug slashed a Turkish shopkeeper's neck with a kitchen knife and shouted 'you f*****g foreigners, coming to the UK to poison the British people'. Andrew Jefferson, 52, of no fixed abode, screamed the abuse at Hilmi Uludag before stabbing him at Padiciya Wine in Paddington, London, on October 18 last year. Jefferson had apparently chosen his victim at random and can be seen calmly walking around the till before brutally stabbing the shopkeeper in the neck and arm. Scroll down for video . This is the horrific moment Andrew Jefferson yelled 'you f*****g foreigners, coming to the UK to poison the British people' before stabbing Hilmi Uludag at a shop in London in October last year . Mr Uladag said the assailant left him with slashes to his neck, chin and leg. Southwark Crown Court heard the wounds severed the nerves in his face and he was lucky to survive the frenzied attack. He was also left with injuries to his leg from falling on broken glass. Police attended the scene and arrested Jefferson, who had been detained in the shop by Mr Uludag's colleagues. Turkish national Mr Uludag told the court he had sold Jefferson two cans of beer between 10.30 and 11.00 that evening. 'He said nothing, no words at all,' said Mr Uludag. 'He didn't even say a word, he took the bag he was just looking at me, not even one word and he just walked out.' Jefferson apparently chose his victim at random - he is pictured calmly walking around the till before stabbing the shopkeeper in the neck and arm and hurling xenophobic abuse at him . Mr Uladag was left with slashes to the neck, chin and leg - the court heard he was lucky to survive . Two hours later Jefferson returned with the small black-handled kitchen knife stuffed up his jumper and walked behind the counter of the shop before he attacked his victim. Mr Uludag grabbed Jefferson's arms as he desperately fought him off and the two men crashed to the floor. He said: 'That is the time I realise this guy's serious, he wants to kill me, he wanted to take my head off.' 'I was screaming, I was saying 'I have been stabbed, I have been stabbed',' Mr Uluday told jurors. 'He was saying 'you f*****g foreigners, coming to the UK to poison the British people'.' Mr Uludag was bandaged on the street before being taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington - where Jefferson had also been taken after the unprovoked attack. 'I remember I was just laying down because I was feeling really weak and at the same time very frightened because we both went to the same hospital,' said Mr Uludag. Mr Uludag needed seven stitches and 'glue' to the neck after the savage assault. His nerves were severed from a cut to the chin and he remains unsure if they will grow again. 'For two months I couldn't even eat because my lips, my mouth, everywhere was numb,' he said. Jefferson is pictured stabbing Mr Uladag during the unprovoked attack in London last October . He was also slashed from the ankle to the knee, there may still be glass inside his leg and he said he is 'hardly walking'. 'My little toe is still numb and I want to know what I have done to deserve all this,' Mr Uludag said. Jefferson was found guilty of attempted murder yesterday after jurors deliberated for less than a day. He had previously admitted the lesser charge of wounding with intent. He will be sentenced on April 22. Detective Constable Graham Hillsdon of Westminster CID said: 'The men showed extreme bravery by tackling the knifeman while their colleague called the police, and holding him until officers arrived minutes later. 'If it wasn't for these men, Jefferson may have gone on to kill or seriously injure someone else that night.'","Andrew Jefferson, 52, stabbed Turkish shopkeeper in unprovoked attack .

"Troubled Hollywood star Charlie Sheen has launched a bizarre, racist Twitter rant at Barack Obama where he calls the President 'Barry Satera Kenya'. Sheen, who starred in Platoon, Young Guns and The Three Musketeers, sent the tweet after President Obama chose Kansas for the NCAA college basketball tournament live on ESPN's SportsCenter. The actor wrongly accused President Obama of failing to send official representation to the funeral of Major General Harold Greene who was killed in Afghanistan in 2014. In reality, the administration was represented by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Scroll down for video . Offensive: Charlie Sheen launched a bizarre twitter rant against US President Barack Obama . Prediction: The President was making his annual selection for the NCAA Men's basketball tournament . Bizarre: Sheen claimed the President refused to attend the funerals of soldiers but had time to talk about basketball . The bizarre tweet said, 'Barry Satera Kenya u won't attend a soldier's funeral uhkros da street that u kild yet u hav time 4 brackets? s a d' Mr Obama's father, Barack Snr, was born in Kenya but met his mother while a student in Hawaii, where the future president was born. One Twitter user defended the President, suggesting that Sheen 'avoid drinking the bong water'. Others suggested that mentioning Kenya in his tweet was racist. Sheen, who famously entertains a number of conspiracy theories, has been a vocal critic of President Obama, criticizing his failure to sponsor armed guards in schools to prevent future massacres. Last month, Sheen admitted that he would like to run for President himself, despite his well-chronicled problems with drugs, with his father Martin - who played the President in the well-known television show The West Wing - as his vice-President. He said: 'I conducted a poll - it was like ten guys. In every situation - it doesn't matter the ethics scenario or the social scenario - when I say, ""Hey, what if I ran for president?"" It's a hundred per cent.' 'Guess who my vice president is? My dad. 'It would be Sheen and Sheen 2016. Running on a platform of truth and transparency. Seriously.' Love: President Obama is an avid basketball fan and has been making his annual NCAA selections since 2009 . The actor is a so-called 9/11 'truther' who believes in a range of implausible conspiracy theories surrounding the attacks 2011 attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. President Barack Obama predicted that Kentucky will remain undefeated during the NCAA tournament and will win the title. The President is a massive basketball fan and has delivered his NCAA selections live on ESPN since taking office. However, despite the President's familiarity with basketball, he has not picked the correct national champion since his first year in office when North Carolina won in 2009. In 2010 he backed Kansas, who went out to North Iowa. In 2011, the President once again backed Kansas, who were defeated in the south west final. In 2012, Mr Obama switched to North Carolina, who were defeated by his previous team Kansas. In 2013, he backed Indiana, who were defeated by Syracuse . In 2014, the President threw his support behind Michigan State who were defeated by Connecticut in the eastern regional final . 2015: Kentucky . 'I think Kentucky is going to take it,' Obama said later in the day. 'But, you know, I haven't won since my first year in office. ... So I wouldn't necessarily take my bracket and copy it.' In 2009, he accused the US government of being involved in the attacks which claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people. He said that President Obama should reopen the investigation into the attacks. Sheen accused the commission established to investigate the atrocity as a 'whitewash', claiming that 'the official 9/11 story is a fraud'. He said the attacks were being used 'as the pretext for the systematic dismantling of our Constitution and our Bill of Rights.' Sheen argued that former President George W Bush used the 9/11 attacks as a pretext to justify his subsequent invasion of Iraq. He also accused the CIA of being in league with the then al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. He said: 'We cannot allow governments to continue to advance their political agendas by exploiting forged pretexts... the establishment is upset that the population is waking up to false flag terror.' Sheen first questioned the events of 9/11 in 2006 when he said: 'It seems to me like 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75 per cent of their targets, that feels like a conspiracy theory. It raises a lot of questions.' In 2011, he voiced doubts about whether President Obama was born in the United States. 'For starters, I was f***** born here, how about that? And I got proof! Nothing Photoshopped about my birth certificate,' he said.","Charlie Sheen launched his rant after seeing President Obama on ESPN .

"Testimony heard by a grand jury that declined to indict a police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner will not be released, a judge said Thursday, arguing there wasn't a good enough reason to make the secret information public. The New York Civil Liberties and others had asked the court to order Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan to release the grand jury transcript, including the testimony of the officer involved, Daniel Pantaleo, and dozens of witnesses, detailed descriptions of evidence and other documentation. A similar step was voluntarily taken by the prosecutor in Ferguson, Missouri, when a grand jury there refused to indict an officer in the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Not important enough? New York State Justice William Garnett said the parties who brought the lawsuit did not establish a 'compelling and particularized need' to release it . Both Garner and Brown were black; the officers involved are white. The deaths sparked nationwide protests about the treatment of communities of color by law enforcement and a debate about the role of race in policing. Civil liberties lawyers had argued that the public needed to reconcile the widely watched video of the arrest with the decision not to indict the officer involved. But State Supreme Court Justice William Garnett wrote that the law required the NYCLU and the other parties who brought the lawsuit to establish a 'compelling and particularized need' to release the grand jury minutes. 'What would they use the minutes for? The only answer which the court heard was the possibility of effecting legislative change,' he wrote. 'That proffered need is purely speculative and does not satisfy the requirements of the law.' Donovan argued that the disclosure would damage the credibility of prosecutors seeking to assure both grand jurors and witnesses that details of their participation would be kept from public view. Following the grand jury's decision, Donovan asked for some information to be made public, but it didn't include testimony or exhibits shown to jurors. Caught on camera: Garner, left, died after cops tried to arrest him for illegally selling untaxed cigarettes. The officer who held him in a chokehold, Daniel Pantaleo was not indicted for the death . 'I can't breathe': The heavyset Garner, who had asthma, is heard on tape gasping, 'I can't breathe.' He later was pronounced dead at a hospital . The judge also agreed with arguments by Donovan's office that secrecy was needed to assure witnesses that they would not be subjected to public criticism for their cooperation. 'This concern is particularly cogent in 'high publicity cases' where the witnesses' truthful and accurate testimony is vital,' Garnett wrote. 'It is in such notorious cases that witnesses' cooperation and honesty should be encouraged — not discouraged — for fear of disclosure.' The proponents claimed Donovan was duplicitous for going to court to ask for a partial disclosure of details like the number of witnesses, only to turn around and argue against the release of more meaningful information like testimony and prosecutors' instructions to the grand jury. Pantaleo and other officers stopped Garner on July 17 on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. A video shot by an onlooker and widely watched online shows Garner telling the officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed. Pantaleo responded by wrapping his arm around Garner's neck in what he said was a sanctioned takedown move and not a banned chokehold. The heavyset Garner, who had asthma, is heard on the tape gasping, 'I can't breathe.' He later was pronounced dead at a hospital. Jonathan Moore, who represents Garner's family, said they were 'disturbed' by the ruling. 'We think this grand jury process was deeply flawed,' he said.  'We think the ability for the public to see what that process was like would have been an important step in understanding what happened here.' Battle cry: Daily protests broke out nationwide following the decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo with 'I can't breathe' becoming the demonstrators' battle cruy . Protesters rallying against a grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner gather in Foley Square, Thursday, December 4, 2014 . Police make an arrest as protesters rallying against a grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer.

"Thieves rummaged through an unconscious man's pockets to steal his phone as he lay dying from hypothermia, a court heard. Scott Stephenson, 19, took the iPhone 4 from the 22-year-old victim as he lay in the street in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, while friend Dale Walker, 25, looked on. The next morning the victim's body was discovered close to a playground, and a post mortem examination revealed he had died from hypothermia during the cold December night. Teenage thief Scott Stephenson (left) rummaged through an unconscious man's pockets to steal his phone as he lay dying in an alleyway from hypothermia, while friend Dale Walker (right) looked on, a court heard . Stephenson and Walker are now facing jail after Stephenson admitted theft at South Tyneside Magistrates Court while Walker admitted handling stolen goods. The court was told that the pair had been travelling on the same train as the 22-year-old victim, who was not named in court, and they had all got off at the Chichester Metro station in South Shields. The victim had suggested that they all continued on to one of their homes, but Stephenson and Walker declined and ran away. The 22-year-old is then thought to have tripped and fallen as he tried to go after them, landing in the road. Stephenson and Walker, who are both from South Shields, returned 30 minutes later and found him still lying there unconscious. But instead of helping him or calling an ambulance Stephenson rummaged through his pockets and stole the iPhone 4. The next morning the victim's body was discovered close to a playground in this alleyway in South Shields, and a post mortem examination revealed he had died from hypothermia during the cold December night . It is thought the man tripped and fell as he tried to go after Stephenson (left) and Walker (right). They returned 30 minutes later and found him unconscious . Keith Laidlaw, prosecuting, told the court: 'They found him lying there. Stephenson said he was breathing and snoring. 'He searched his pocket and stole a mobile phone. Walker later said that he watched as Stephenson stole the phone from the victim's pocket. 'Now, the defendants have said as far as they were concerned, they felt he was alive and sleeping at the time the property was taken. 'The victim was vulnerable, he was 22, just a young man. The ramifications of what happened spread far beyond the victim.' District Judge Helen Cousins committed the case to Newcastle Crown Court, where the pair will be sentenced on April 13. 'They have taken away the one thing that would have allowed him to get help if he was able to,' she said.","Scott Stephenson, 19, stole man's iPhone while Dale Walker, 25 looked on .

The mother-of-four, from Burnley, Lancashire, says she has been left with bruises from the ghoul, and on one occasion was pinned down to the bed. In another video taken by Ms Ayres a spoon begins moving around on her kitchen counter (pictured) The spoon appears to be dragged around by some unseen force before standing up on its end and beginning to spin around on its tip . She even claims to have captured some of the hauntings on film, including levitating spoons, light fixtures swinging from the ceiling, and a Ouija board flying across the room. Ms Ayres, who lives with partner Jason Heys, 45, said the disturbances began happening in 2009 around the time her brother Paul passed away. She said: 'Ever since my brother died strange things have occurred in every house I’ve lived in, it’s been a living hell. Among the spooky happenings that Ms Ayres has recorded is a light fixture swinging from the ceiling . 'Probably the worst time was when I was pinned to the bed, I’ll never forget it - it was very traumatic. 'I believe this is happening because death has always followed me, but I have strong suspicions the spirit could be my brother, who died when I was younger. 'We had a very troubled relationship, perhaps that’s why he’s come back to haunt me.' Ms Ayres said she began trying to capture the ghost's movements on film with her camera phone after people began doubting her story. However she now believes she has angered the spirit after the spooky happenings have become more common. She added: 'The paranormal activity first started in 2009 when I began to hear bangs at night, and then scratches appeared on the wall. 'Since these first encounters I've had nothing but rampant paranormal activity in every house I've lived in, I'm just at the end of my tether. 'I have even woke up with bruises some mornings, despite not being in contact with anyone. 'It's hard to get the footage as sometimes the paranormal activity is too quick to film, but I think I've done well to catch what I have with a basic camera phone. The mother-of-four, who lives with partner Jason Heys, 45, says she has moved house five times in order to escape the ghost, but says it is following her from property to property . Ms Ayres said she began recording the incidents (which included a levitating spoon) to convince people of her story, but now fears she may have angered the spirit . 'Given the rocky relationship with my brother, I genuinely believe this ghost is haunting me, not just the house which I live in, which is the most terrifying thing.' The videos have sparked a furious debate on social media, with a swathe of paranormal investigators offering to conduct a thorough paranormal investigation into the disturbances. According to Sefton Paranormal Investigators, if the video footage is genuine, this type of paranormal phenomenon would be classified as a poltergeist - a supernatural being often blamed for physical disturbances. Ms Ayres believes the poltergeist could be brother Paul (pictured) who died in 2009. She described their relationship as 'fraught'","Donna Ayres, 33, says the hauntings began in 2009 after brother Paul died .

"Her beaming face was a rare moment of joy amongst the devastating scenes of Hurricane Katrina. A decade on,  Staff Sgt. Mike Maroney is desperate to trace the beaming little girl he rescued from Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters. The US airman was with an elite Air Force pararescue unit when he plucked her to safety from her family's destroyed home in New Orleans, during the disaster. Moment of joy: Staff Sgt. Mike Maroney rescued the unknown girl and her family from their flood hit home in New Orleans, a week after Hurricane Katrina struck . The little girl and her family were still waiting for help about a week after the storm hit when the specialist team swooped in to help. The joyful image went on to appear on coinage and paper placemats at the base exchange, on phone cards and a magazine cover. For Mr Maroney, it was a brief moment of joy during what seemed like a hopeless mission. 'It had been such a rough week, when she wrapped me up in that hug, I was in la-la land,' he said. 'Nothing else existed. I was just loving that hug.' The veteran, who has since completed tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and was deployed to the Philippines, had arrived with his team a week earlier to do what they could to help the devastated city. A man suffering from an aortic aneurysm who was unlikely to survive and a comatose woman who had not left her own bed for years, were amongst those they assisted. Rescue: A man is hoisted to safety, like the little girl Staff Sgt. Mike Maroney is trying to trace, after being rescued from the top of a vehicle in the flooded streets of New Orleans, Louisiana, in September 2005 . Devastated: Water surrounds homes just east of downtown in this aerial view of damage from Hurricane Katrina, 10 years ago . But the dad-of-two was particularly moved by this girl, whose name he never knew, as he had a child the same age. He told the Airforce Times how he helped save the fearless youngster with her parents and four siblings and remembers how she excitedly pointed out her home and her school from the hoist. She reached out to rub her mother's back and comforted her as she cried saying 'It's OK,' and 'We're safe. Don't worry.' As he dropped her off at New Orleans International Airport with the rest of her family, a colleague captured their hug on camera. 'If I never do anything else again, that hug and that smile made it all worthwhile,' he said. He had no idea how far the image would travel until more than a year later, when he was on a deployment to Iraq. Another airman told him he had seen the image on military coins handed out as change at the base exchange. Disaster zone: Fire and floodwater in New Orleans following the hurricane which left 1,833 people dead . MR Maroney said: 'It was everywhere, on Burger King placemats and AT&T phone cards. I didn't expect that.' A foundation for fallen rescue airmen — So That Others May Live Foundation— used it on their brochures. Now a civilian pararescue instructor at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, he left active duty in August 2006 and has spent the last eight years in the Air Force Reserve, rising to the rank of master sergeant. Since Katrina, he has tried to trace the girl, even sending a letter to Oprah Winfrey but never heard anything back. He has circulated the picture online once a year in the hope someone might recognise her but to no avail. 'I would love to get another hug and see how she's doing. I'd love her to know that there isn't a day I haven't thought of her.' Do you know who the girl is?

"Charlie Hebdo staff are embroiled in a bitter dispute over who gets to control the French magazine, months after eight of its writers and cartoonists were murdered by terrorists. The row was sparked by a sudden increase in the magazine's sales and revenue in the wake of the brutal attacks on January 7, according to the Times. It has reportedly made £21.6million since then after its usual circulation of 30,000-a-week rocketed to hundreds of thousands. Now the surviving staff members want that money and shares of the magazine - 40 per cent of which are owned by its murdered editor's parents - to be divided equally. Six of the Charlie Hebdo staff killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . Terror: On January 7, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi raided the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris and killed 11 people, sparking a string of terror attacks across the city . As many as 11 employees have instructed their lawyers to turn the magazine - which has published cartoons of the prophet Muhammad on its cover - into a workers' cooperative. It would mean they all have a stake in the company but their move has been attacked by another anonymous contributor in a leaked email to French news agency Agence France-Presse. The unnamed contributor accused the plotters of trying to grab the shares that belonged to the magazine's murdered editor Stephane Charbonnier 'before the worms have finished eating him'. 40 per cent of the company is owned by his parents, another 40 by the magazine's new editor Laurent Sourisseau and the final 20 per cent belongs to financial director Eric Portheault. One of the magazine's journalists Laurent Léger said: 'A new distribution of the capital would allow for the incredible influx of funds to the newspaper to be used in the most transparent manner possible.' And Patrick Pelloux - who writes a column for Charlie Hebdo - believes a co-operative would bind contributors to the newspaper. He said: 'When a company has been decimated, you feel completely tied to it. It is not a question of sharing the cake. The money does not interest us.' However a spokesman for Sourisseau and Portheault said: 'All this money is doing more harm than good. Greedy: An unnamed contributor has accused staff of trying to grab the shares that belonged to the magazine's murdered editor Stephane Charbonnier (pictured) 'before the worms have finished eating him' Demand: Since the brutal attack on Charlie Hebdo in January, the magazine's usual circulation of 30,000 a week has boomed to hundreds of thousands . 'It makes you think of those funerals where everyone is fighting over the grandmother's jewellery on the way back from the cemetery.' He added that the owners had promised not to pay themselves dividends for three years and wanted to ensure the £3million received in donations after the attack went to victims' families. 'We note the desire of the staff to be associated with the life of the newspaper. But we are a long way from thinking about the make-up of the shareholders.' This is not the first time that Charlie Hebdo has been split over financial matters. In 2008, it's then-editor Philippe Val faced a backlash when it emerged he paid himself dividends of over £200,000 when sale rose following the controversial publication of issues featuring the Propher Muhammad.","Staff instructed their lawyers to turn the magazine into a workers' cooperative .

"Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have certainly packed a punch while on their tour of the US, cramming in plenty of sights during their four-day visit and attracting visitors from far and wide. And the final day of their tour saw the couple receive a warm message from boxing royalty. Boxing legend Muhammad Ali paid tribute to the Prince as he and Camilla arrived in his home city of Louisville - describing the heir to the throne as 'the greatest'. Scroll down for the video .

Welcome to Kentucky! The Prince of Wales is greeted by by the Governor and First Lady of Kentucky, Steve and Jane Beshear after touching down at Louisville International Airport . The sport star's words came in a letter - not in person - as he was not well enough to join leading figures from the city at a cultural greeting for Charles and Camilla. But the presence of the three-time former world heavyweight boxing champion was still felt when a letter written by him was read to the prince. The 73-year-old sports star, considered by many to be the greatest boxer of all time, retired in 1981 and has suffered with Parkinson's disease since the mid-1980s. A marching band greets the royal couple as they arrive at the Kentucky Center for African American Heritage . The pensive Prince: Charles interacts with exhibitors while touring a cultural festival at the Kentucky Center for African American Heritage .

The royal couple were visiting the Kentucky Centre for African American Heritage - a stone's throw from Ali's childhood home - Louisville's Mayor Greg Fischer welcomed the royal couple. The welcome was, on every level, a traditional one. A choir serenaded with a rendition of 'My Old Kentucky Home' and later the couple toured stands showcasing the state of Kentucky and Louisville's heritage, culture, history and sustainability projects. Mr Fischer reading Ali's words said: '(My wife) Lonnie and I welcome you to our hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, USA. We are honoured that you have come to explore, share and learn about new sustainable initiatives that are so close to your heart.' The former sportsman could not help mentioning the state's successful college basketball team which is on a long winning streak. Ali added: 'Louisville prides itself on being a compassionate city and we are confident that you will leave feeling a sense of our southern hospitality, caring for the environment, and yes - our love for college basketball. 'As you travel back to your homeland, we hope you know how much this city respects and admires the many contributions you have made in the world. 'We think you are the greatest.'

Camilla chats to local children at Neighborhood House and, right, joins a toddler and baby group . Their trip has been full of sporting moments. Yesterday, the Prince of Wales went bowling at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington D.C and managed to knock over four pins - much to the delight of veterans and a watching Duchess of Cornwall. Along with a visit to the bowling alley, the royal couple were also shown the library, which boasts stunning views of the Washington Monument, and the wellness facilities for the pensioners who live there. The couple also took time on their final day to visit the Food Literacy Project at Oxmoor Farm in Louisville where Camilla found herself making pizzas with a group of youngsters who insisted on topping it with carrots and radishes. Camilla joined children from Louisville, Kentucky who were part of a 'from field to fork' group learning not only how to grow their produce but cook it. After helping the youngsters plant a rhubarb plant in a plot at Oxmoor Farm, an 18th century estate, she sat around a table in the open air and helped nine-year-old Fred Meadows create the savoury treat. The children use seasonal produce in their cooking so radishes, kale and carrots were added to the pizza - but they were cooked after the Duchess had left the group. Earlier the Duchess had visited a community project called Neighbourhood House, running since 1896 in a disadvantaged area of Louisville. Originally rich members of the community moved into the neighbourhood, with affluent and poor members living together and raising standards. She chatted to Jason Logsdon, 11, who comes to the centre every day to do homework or sport and he told the Duchess he wanted to join the CIA when he is older. He said: ""I knew who she was but not much about her, but she was awesome, she's cool."" The Duchess ended her visit to Louisville by visiting the home of the world famous Kentucky Derby - the Churchill Downs racecourse - to celebrate the work of the Brooke. Camilla is president of the Brooke a worldwide equine welfare charity and her visit marked the official launch of its American fundraising branch. She also met a pair of donkeys and gave them treats and chatted to jockeys and their mounts. Other highlights from the day included hearing an employee for local spirits maker Brown-Forman Corp. showing how bourbon barrels are made. There was also a brief stop at one of the city's most recognisable landmarks, the Big Four Bridge.","The final day of their four-day visit to the US takes in Louisville, Kentucky .

"The White House, State Department and Hillary Clinton's personal office knew in August 2014 that the former secretary of state was using a private email account to conduct official government business. Clinton's staff, who knew that House Republicans had received information from the private email address, made the decision to keep the information from the public. Her staff waited until after the New York Times published an article on Tuesday about the subject to discuss the email address. Scroll down for video . White House and State Department staff, as well as Hillary Clinton's personal office knew about her personal email address in August, but her office decided to keep the information from the public . Key personnel from the Obama Administration and on Clinton's staff were aware of the address for six months, sources said, according to Politico. And, it is possible that Clinton distributed sensitive information through her personal email, the State Department has admitted, and only a review of her messages will determine if she broke the rules. The State Department first became aware of the email address when responding to a request form the House Select Committee during the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the US consulate based in the Libyan city of Benghazi. When State and White House officials noticed Clinton's private email address on documents, they notified her personal staff and said they should take lead, since she was no longer a government employee. Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said staff believes Clinton's email practices were not a cause for concern, nor did they break rules. 'There was nothing to get ahead of,' Merrill said. 'This was perfectly permissible and the practice of past secretaries, and not only did she turn over all pertinent emails, she has taken the extraordinary step of now asking them to be released to the public. When that’s done, which we hope is soon, it will become clear that it’s all in there and then some.' A State Department official who spoke to The Washington Post, however, acknowledged that some of the correspondence Clinton sent through her private email may constitute a breach of security guidelines. The official said that Clinton didn't directly defy State's policies by using her personal email for government communications, but a manual obtained by news outlets shows that since 2005 State has directed its employees to use its email system because it has the 'proper level of security control.' The former secretary of state's team has responded to a storm of criticism surrounding Clinton's email practices by hunkering down and waiting for it to pass. But top communications gurus are recommending the campaign immediately act to deflate 'email-gate' Top communications gurus are recommending Clinton' steam immediately act to deflate email-gate. Democrats in early states worry the scandal is an early warning sign that Clinton's presumed presidential campaign is on the path to destruction and could 'implode'. From the outset, the State Department has cautiously avoided declaring Clinton innocent of any wrongdoing while encouraging reporters to give her the benefit of the doubt. 'She and her team has said that it was not used for anything but unclassified work,' Marie Harf, deputy spokeswoman for State told reporters on Wednesday, adding moments later, 'I don’t think there was any indication she was doing anything but [that] here, so I don’t think it’s really a pertinent question.' Further pressed to 'definitively' claim Clinton wasn't sending classified information through her personal email – which is against the law – Harf argued that 'you can’t claim that about anyone’s unclassified email'. She also noted in the exchange that the department doesn't monitor its other employees' private communications to make sure that classified information isn't being shared. 'I’m not sure why this would be anything different,' Harf contended. 'I don’t know why this would be held to a different standard.' When Clinton did need to discuss classified information she communicated through her her staff, the State Department spokeswoman claimed. Later asked if Clinton's exclusive use of personal email was 'problematic,' Harf stated that that 'there was no prohibition on this practice.' 'So I’m not going to make a judgment about appropriateness or not,' she said. 'I’m telling you what the regulations say and don’t say. She operated under them, and that’s as much as I can say.' Guidelines published by Politico and other publications on Thursday evening suggest otherwise, however. 'It is the Department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized [Automated Information System], which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information,' the State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual says. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf insists that Mrs. Clinton didn't send any classified material through her private 'clintonemails.com' account while she led the agency . An official who spoke to Politico said that it is true that 'sensitive but unclassified information should be handled on a system with certain security requirements' with the caveat 'except in certain circumstances.' The State Department insider said it's not true that 'by using personal email she is automatically out of step' with the guidelines outlined in the manual. Likewise, the Post's source at State said, 'We are not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of Secretary Clinton’s 55,000 pages of e-mails.' National Democrats aligned with Clinton are blowing off the email squabble as background noise that won't affect voters' perceptions of their party's most formidable presidential candidate. 'Voters do not give a s*** about what email Hillary used. They don't even give a fart,' Paul Begala, confidante of and adviser to Bill Clinton,' said Thursday on CNN. Media Matters founder David Brock said in an op-ed on CNN that the media 'hype' around Clinton's emails is the 'perfect example of 'gotcha' journalism, where reporters will take any bait the Republicans give them without proper vetting.' Brock, whose group American Bridge runs a pro-Clinton fact-checking service called Correct the Record, also argued that the Clintons 'are held to a double standard when it comes to media scrutiny'. 'Their perfectly usual, above board behavior is spun as secretive and unaccountable - while Republicans are left relatively unscathed,' he charged. Regardless, top-level communicators on the left and the right say that Clinton currently risks mishandling the crisis. DUELING TWEETS, PART I: Likely Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush goaded Clinton to be more transparent . DUELING TWEETS, PART II: Clinton responded by saying 'I want the public to see my email' and asking her old agency to hurry up the process . Former Barack Obama senior adviser David Axelrod has said that the longer Clinton and her team wait to respond to the flurry of questions about her use of not only a non-official email for her work at the State Department but also a personal domain name and a private server, the likelier the situation is to get out of hand. 'It’s a ball of wool that won’t go away until the questions are answered,' he told the New York Times on Thursday. Ari Fleisher, a former spokesman for George W. Bush, told Bloomberg, Clinton's team is 'making a big mistake' by not letting her address the issue publicly. 'This is immediately understood and problematic in the eyes of the average voter. Everyone can relate to it and understand it… it cuts through the clutter in a way that hurts her,' he said. 'This is one of those issues that’s not going away anytime soon.' Clinton fired off a tweet on Wednesday night saying she wanted the public to read her emails and had given the State Department permission to publish them once they it finishes its review. And a spokesman for her confirmed to the press at the beginning of the week that all of her emails that pertain to the State Department have been remanded to the federal government. Questions continue to linger, however, and neither Clinton nor her team have given a reasonable explanation for the former Obama administration official's actions. Larry Hogden, chairman of Iowa’s Cedar County Democrats, told Politico the email controversy 'adds more reason' for other politicians in the party to explore presidential campaigns. 'Because, who knows? She could implode totally,' he said.","Staff discovered private emails in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate based in the Libyan city of Benghazi .

"The families of nine people killed in the Newtown elementary school shooting have filed lawsuits against the estate of the gunman's mother. The lawsuits allege that Nancy Lanza incorrectly secured her legally owned Bushmaster AR-15 rifle, which her troubled adult son, Adam Lanza, used to kill 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, the Connecticut Post reported Friday. Adam Lanza killed his mother at their Newtown home before carrying out the school shooting and committing suicide as police arrived. The families of nine people killed in the Newtown elementary school shooting have filed lawsuits against the estate of shooter Adam Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza. The lawsuits reportedly seek to collect on her homeowner's insurance.  Mrs. Lanza's home is seen in this 2014 file photo . The lawsuits seek to collect on Nancy Lanza's homeowner's insurance, the Connecticut Post reported. Bridgeport lawyer Josh Koskoff, representing eight of the families suing, said homeowner's insurance applies when a person is injured as a result of an unsecured firearm in a home being accessed by a third party. 'With this many claimants, the money ends up being a symbolic gesture, but it serves as an important reminder that people who keep firearms in the home must be scrupulous about securing their weapons,' Koskoff said in a statement, adding that the policy is estimated to be worth between $1 million and $1.5 million. Eight lawsuits were filed in Bridgeport, and one lawsuit was filed in Danbury by Angelo Ziotas, the Connecticut Post reported. A status conference for the eight lawsuits is set to take place in Bridgeport Superior Court next month, according to the newspaper. Shooter: Adam Lanza killed his mother at their Newtown home before carrying out the school shooting and committing suicide as police arrived . Attorney John Majewski, who represents Nancy Lanza's estate, is seeking to have all the cases consolidated into one, according to the newspaper. Koskoff, Ziotas, and Majewski did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment from Daily Mail Online on Sunday. A publicist for Koskoff's law firm sent his earlier statement to Daily Mail Online on Monday. Koskoff's law firm also is suing the maker and sellers of the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle on behalf of families of the school shooting victims. The wrongful-death and negligence lawsuit says the rifle should not have been sold for civilian use because of its overwhelming firepower. Bushmaster, which on its website has a warning against improper or careless handling of its firearms, hasn't filed a response to the lawsuit in federal court but has indicated it intends to file a motion to dismiss it. Newtown officials bought the Lanzas' home from Nancy Lanza's estate for $1 and voted in January to tear it down.","The families of nine people killed in the Newtown elementary school shooting have filed lawsuits against the estate of the gunman's mother .

"A Scottish airport has been shortlisted in the hunt to find the world's most iconic and scenic plane landings . Barra Airport, Scotland - and the world's - only regular beach runway has been selected as one of the world's most stunning airport approaches in a competition which sees the small island airport go head to head with some of the best known destinations. The airport is competing for top spot in a poll by PrivateFly.com, the leading private jet booking service, against some of the world's most iconic airports, including Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Venice, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Hong Kong. Scroll down for video... A voter said of Barra Airport in Scotland: 'Where else in the world can you fly over majestic mountains, stunning coastline and turquoise seas before descending over an historic harbour castle and landing on a large silver sand beach? Totally stunning and totally unique. Nothing comes close.' David Scowsill, president & CEO, World Travel & Tourism Council said of Saba in the Caribbean: 'A simply unforgettable and thrilling landing on the world's shortest runway, flanked by cliffs and ocean with a striking view of its active Volcano, Mount Scenery.' 'This perennial favorite is an AvGeek's dream, for spotting and flying in. There's no room for error, with a short beach on final approach and mountains on departure. But it's always a thrill!' (Benet Wilson, aviation journalist, on Saint Martin in the Caribbean). Last year's winner of the most iconic airport landing spot was Nice Cote D'Azur, which was praised by voters for its 'sublime beauty' A a panel of travel industry judges - which include Forbes' Matthew Stibbe, Tiffany Dowd of Luxe Social Media, and Travel Weekly Chairman Clive Jacobs - have chosen 37 airports which they think offer the most stunning views on approach in the world. Barra, which won the award in 2012, says on their nomination: 'Where else in the world can you fly over majestic mountains, stunning coastline and turquoise seas before descending over an historic harbour castle and landing on a large silver sand beach? Totally stunning and totally unique. Nothing comes close.' Barra Airport handled 10,560 passengers last year and is one of the smallest airports in the shortlist. By contrast, Sochi airport handles 2.4 million passengers whereas Amsterdam handles more than 50 million passengers. Planes can only land at Barra when the tide is out and it is the only beach airport which is used by scheduled services. 'A stunning landing to see the Northern lights.'

On the approach, you will see many of the private hotel islands, and you won’t be able to miss the contrast with the semi-organised chaos of Male island.' 'Scenic approach over the desert, flying right over the strip just gets you in the mood for partying!' (Sylvie Peron, aviation journalist on Las Vegas) A voter for the Cape Town, South Africa approach: 'Spectacular views of Table Mountain as you approach. One of the most beautiful cities on earth.' The airstrip was also made famous in the film Staggered starring Martin Clunes. The shortlist gives a fascinating mix of global descents to experience at least once in a lifetime. From major city views such as Las Vegas and London City; to tiny remote airstrips such as Saba in the Caribbean. Bill Prince, deputy editor of GQ said of London City Airport: 'As the city is swept up in its greatest makeover since the Great Fire of London, landing in the beating heart of the world's financial centre takes some beating.'

"Being a member of a boy band is always a risky business but being a member of a tribute boy band is even more uncertain, as the 'Zayn Malik' of the UK's most popular One Direction tribute band found out last week. Jamie Searls, 25, from London, has been part of Only One Direction for the last three years and was preparing to go on tour with the group when the news broke last Wednesday. But despite Zayn's departure from the group, Jamie has decided to carry on with the band in the traditional five-person line-up. Scroll down for video . Aaron Foster (Niall Horan), Henry Allan (Harry Styles), Matt (Louis), Jamie (Zayn) and Matt Brinkler (Niall) who together form the tribute group Only One Direction . He told FEMAIL: 'I guess we’re all a little thoughtful. Nothing lasts forever but the last three years have been unforgettable for us all. 'There’s been tears of joy, tears of pain, hatred, love but when it’s over, we will all leave with a set of friends and I for one, cherish them…. but don’t let them know that . 'But Only One Direction will be gigging as normal as a five piece with Zayn in it - as long as people want to see us, I think we would be silly not to carry on. 'It’s great to be able to do what you love for a living.' Jamie Searls (left) has been playing the part of Zayn Malik (right) in a tribute band for three years . Jamie onstage as Zayn in 2013 . Jamie joined Only One Direction in 2012 after being contacted by an old friend who had signed on to play the part of Harry Styles. He said: 'I knew Henry Allan, who plays Harry Styles - we were in the West End Gospel Choir together. 'He called me and said, ""Hey, I’ve got a really fun opportunity. It’s for a 1D tribute,"" three years later, I’m still here.' Since then the group have toured the UK, Ireland and the UAE. Jamie said: 'It’s been a rollercoaster for us.  It’s complete madness. 'I entered this group thinking that it would be a little pocket money but it quickly became a full time job. 'I was always sheepish about saying, I’m in a 1D tribute but truthfully, I’m very proud of the shows we put on.' Zayn with the rest of One Direction in 2012 . And while they may not be the real deal, it doesn't stopped teenage fans going crazy at shows and meet and greets. Jamie said: 'It can get a little crazy. In Dubai, we had to have security and had to be moved to avoid crushing crowds. 'People remark on a passing resemblance [between Zayn and I]. But the truth is we’re not trying to be lookalike band. That would be a little token tribute. 'No disrespect to the other tributes out there but we’re a theatre show, we like to bill ourselves as an experience.' Jamie onstage as Zayn from One Direction . For the meantime, Jamie is going to continue performing as Zayn, but even if all the members of the real One Direction decide to throw in the towel, he has his own music to fall back on. On Tuesday he releases his debut solo single Doing Time on iTunes. Jamie said: 'I'm inspired by perseverance and learning from those around me.

"A teenage boy has described the bizarre moment he was diagnosed with testicular cancer using a pregnancy test. Byron Geldard, from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was given the test by doctors because the disease can cause the body to make the same hormone produced during pregnancy. After getting a positive result, the 19-year-old was given the devastating news he had the disease and began seven months of treatment . Now, after surgery and intensive chemotherapy, he is in remission - and has become an ambassador for Teenage Cancer Trust. Scroll down for video . Byron Geldard, was diagnosed with testicular cancer using a pregnancy test. The disease can cause the body to produce the same hormone as produced during pregnancy . After the 'positive' result, the 19-year-old began months of treatment at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge . Mr Geldard said: 'It was all very surreal to be honest. 'There I was with a positive pregnancy test and something growing inside me. I thought I was going to end up in a documentary.' Home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta. Experts say beta hCG can also signal testicular cancer. Dr Danish Mazhar, Consultant Medical Oncologist at Cambridge University Hospitals, said: 'The pregnancy hormone (HCG) is often (but not always) produced by testicular tumours. 'Where it is produced, it can used for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. 'In cases where the cancer has spread, the level of the HCG can be very high and if the clinical picture fits with a testicular cancer then a pregnancy test, which effectively is a test for HCG in the urine, can be used to make the diagnosis.' Home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta. Experts say beta HCG can also signal testicular cancer. Rob Cornes, Male Cancer Information Nurse at the charity Orchid, told MailOnline: HCG is one of three blood tests performed in all men with testicular cancer - it identifies how active and possibly widespread the cancer may be. 'It can also be used to help monitor treatment and determine how well treatment is working and to identify men who may need more intensive treatment.' However he stressed there are two types of testicular cancer - and HGC is not present in the majority of cases of the most common form. And any man worried should not use a pregnancy test as a diagnostic tool. Mr Cornes added: 'To be picked up by a urine pregnancy test, the level of HCG has to be very high which will not be the case for many testicular cancers. 'It is not and never has been a standard test . 'HCG can also be raised in the presence of other things such as illegal performance enhancing drugs (used by athletes etc.)' Mr Geldard claims his hospital experience was as bizarre as his diagnosis. 'When I was about to go into surgery, I had to have an epidural like a pregnant woman - it was all very weird. 'It's really hard to describe how it felt - you don't really come to terms with what's going on, you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise what was happening to me. 'I'm relieved to be in remission, and now I want to help raise awareness. 'Cancer is no longer a death sentence, and I would like to spread that message.' Mr Geldard had just returned from a boy's holiday in Kavos last August, when a niggling pain in his side became too hard to ignore. After visiting his doctor, who could feel a mass in his abdomen, he was referred to his local hospital for an ultrasound. He said: 'Before I went to Kavos I'd been getting this weird pain on and off, but I didn't think much of it. 'I went to the GP about it, but because I was going to the gym it was just put down to muscle pain. 'But when I was referred to the local hospital scans showed that I had a tumour that was spreading into my lungs. 'I was told that it was cancer - but they weren't sure what type - and that I would probably need chemotherapy.' Mr Geldard was referred to the Teenage Cancer Trust unit in Cambridge, where doctors tried to determine what type of cancer he was suffering from. It was there that he was asked to provide a sample for a pregnancy test, to determine if the tumour was producing the hormones linked to both pregnancy, and testicular cancer. Looking back, Mr Geldard said: 'It's really hard to describe how it felt - you don't really come to terms with what's going on, you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise what was happening to me' After getting a positive result from the pregnancy test, Mr Geldard was diagnosed with stage four testicular cancer - which had spread to his abdomen and lungs. The news came just a day before he received his A-level results. In 2012, a man credited the popular social news site Reddit with helping him catch his testicular cancer at an early stage. The patient, who was not identified, took the test left in his apartment by an ex-girlfriend as a joke - but was shocked to discover two pink lines indicating pregnancy. The incident was turned into a crudely drawn black-and-white comic strip by a friend, who put it up on Reddit where it attracted more than 1,300 comments from concerned users. 'If this is true, you should check yourself for testicular cancer. Seriously. Google it,' one commenter wrote. The Reddit user who put up the cartoon passed on the concerned comments to his friend on Monday, the man made an appointment with a doctor who diagnosed him with cancer after detecting a small lump in his right testicle. He said: 'I gave the hospital a urine sample, the pregnancy test came back positive, and I started chemotherapy the day after I was diagnosed. 'I would go in for five days in a row and have the chemo constantly. 'It really took it out of me - my brain was muddled and I found it hard to concentrate on long films or books. 'I suppose I did have some thoughts about death, but I didn't want to approach cancer in a negative way. 'For me, the cancer diagnosis was a positive thing, because it meant that a plan could be put in place to get rid of it. 'Throughout my cycles of chemo the hospital would monitor the ""pregnancy hormone"" through blood tests. 'The hormone had been really, really high, but it was gradually declining which was great news, and the tumours in my lungs and abdomen were shrinking.' In December, Mr Geldard had surgery to remove the growth in his abdomen (and the surrounding lymph nodes) and a testicle. In January, tests revealed he was cancer free. He said: 'It was a really strange feeling to be told I was OK again - you're just sort of expected to go back to normal, but my mindset has completely changed. 'Before all this happened I thought my life was pretty much guaranteed until I was about 85. 'But it gave me the realisation of my own mortality - I sort of had an early midlife crisis.' He now plans to  attend university and says he 'just wants to enjoy life'. 'I'm doing stand up comedy about testicular cancer, as I think people need to be educated about it more. After chemotherapy, which caused him to lose his hair (right), Byron is focusing his energy on living life to the full and raising money for the Teenage Cancer Trust . 'I hated hearing people talk about cancer all the time, and I just thought this is a different way to approach it. 'It's something a bit different, and a way to show that cancer doesn't always have to be a death sentence.' Throughout his cancer journey, he was supported by Teenage Cancer Trust. He said: 'The Teenage Cancer Trust ward was great, the ward is kitted out with a TV, pool tables and free WI-FI. 'Everyone is going through the same thing so you get a lot of support. 'I even had the opportunity to meet John Bishop and Stephen Fry when I was there. 'It gave you an aspect of normality through everything that was going on.'

Cancer of the testicles most commonly affects men aged 15 to 45, with around 2,200 cases diagnosed each year. Around 47 per cent of men diagnosed with the disease will be under 35 years old. Despite it being a relatively rare form of cancer, it is one of the more treatable. If caught at an early stage, men can expect a high cure rate with 98 per cent of sufferers disease-free a year after treatment. If caught at any stage, 96 per cent of men will still be alive 10 years after their treatment. Unlike many cancers, there are few known risk factors for testicular cancer. Men born with an undescended testicle, are at a slightly greater risk. Around 10 per cent of sufferers will have a history of this condition. Having a brother or father affected by testicular cancer can also increase a man's risk. Some research has suggested the disease is slightly more common in men with fertility problems and men with HIV are more likely to develop testicular cancer. Signs and symptoms include: .

"Geraldine Alcorn, 28, faces multiple charges for 'obsessively' texting an 11-year-old student . An 'obsessed' elementary school teacher has been arrested after deluging an 11-year-old student 2,400 text messages, gifts and coded notes in her homework in an attempt to get the girl to run away with her, police say. Investigators do not believe that 28-year-old Geraldine Alcorn's interest in the girl was sexual - instead she wanted to steal the child away from her parents and adopt her. The former teacher at Beechwood Elementary School in Pittsburgh continued to contact the student even after she was suspended and told she was being investigated for her behavior by police and Pittsburgh Public Schools, detectives say. Alcorn was arraigned last week on charges of child luring, corruption of minors and attempting to interfere with custody of the child. She was jailed after being unable to post $100,000 bond. She and the girl exchanged 2,400 text messages in the two weeks before the mother discovered the messages, letters and items the teacher gave her, police said. 'On February 13, 2015, school staff were made aware of concerns that a teacher had developed an improper attachment with a Pittsburgh Beechwood student,' Pittsburgh Public Schools spokeswoman Merecedes Howze said Wednesday. 'In keeping with the school district's procedures, the teacher was immediately placed on suspension while those claims were investigated.' Alcorn resigned March 2, Howze said. Police say Alcorn still tried to contact the girl after that despite knowing police and school officials were investigating and having been warned by police to not contact the student. Alcorn was arrested outside her home and held on $100,000 bail over the texting, which took place over the course of several weeks earlier this year . Alcorn continued to contact the student even after she was forced to resign and warned to stay away from the 11-year-old, police say . Alcorn returned to the school on Friday, March 13, to collect her personal belongings, and on the following Monday, the girl found 'gifts and several letters, some encrypted, in her locker and desk,' according to the criminal complaint. 'The letters, written by Alcorn, instructed the 11-year-old female to contact her.' Alcorn hid her phone number on a math worksheet by telling the girl to dial numbers that had been circled, police said. The girl's mother told police Alcorn had visited their home without permission while the mother was working. The mother then found 21 stickers and letters in the girl's school binder, plus two letters the girl wrote to Alcorn with three headings: 'Things Ms. Alcorn and I can do,' 'what we can do,' and 'when we can do it,' the complaint said. The girl told police she and Alcorn kept their relationship secret and, authorities said, after the 'hundreds and hundreds of text messages and several gifts, Alcorn was able to lure the 11-year-old female into her house.' Among other things, Alcorn discussed adopting the girl or taking her from her home, police said. After that, according to the complaint, Alcorn told the girl 'they would 'be on the run' for a while.'","Geraldine Alcorn was charged with child luring, corruption of minors and attempting to interfere with custody of a child .

"Do you dote treat your children to a gadget or give them money when they perform well at school? According to a study, such actions could be detrimental to their development, and cause them to be more materialistic as adults. The study suggests that those who were rewarded and spoiled as children were more likely to think possessions define who we are. A study by the University of Missouri and the University of Illinois at Chicago found gifts could affect development. Adults were more likely to think possessions define who we are (stock image shown) if they were showered with rewards when they were children . The study was published in the Journal of Consumer Research and conducted by researchers Dr Marsha Richins (University of Missouri) and Dr Lan Nguyen Chaplin (University of Illinois at Chicago). 'Using material possessions to express love or reward children for their achievements can backfire,' wrote the authors in the paper called Material Parenting. 'Loving and supportive parents can unintentionally foster materialism in their children despite their best efforts to steer them away from relying on material possessions to find happiness or to judge others.' Where you live could affect how big your shopping habit is, according to new research. US scientists have found that people who live in wealthy neighbourhoods are more likely to have materialistic values and poor spending habits. And they think that young people living in particularly rich urban areas are the worst offenders. San Francisco State University’s study is the first to show a connection between neighbourhood socioeconomic status and materialism. Dr Ryan Howell, Associate Professor of Psychology at the university, believes the reason for the link is because of ‘relative deprivation,’ which is the feeling someone gets when they believe they are less well-off than those around them. The authors surveyed 701 adults to measure the long-term impact of material parenting. They were asked to describe their current life situation and values, and also reported on a variety of childhood circumstances, their relationship with their parents, and the rewards and punishments they received during three critical ages of childhood . Results showed adults who had received more material rewards and punishments as children were more likely than others to use possessions to define and express who they are. And adults who received many material rewards as children were likely to continue rewarding themselves with material goods and defining themselves through their possessions. Parents should therefore be cautious about using material goods to express their love and reward their children for good behavior, warn the researchers. They say an overemphasis on material possessions during childhood can have long-lasting effects. It can pave 'the way for their children to grow up to be more likely than others to admire people with expensive possessions and judge success by the kinds of things people own,' the authors conclude.

"After months of defending Marvin Gaye's work, the late Motown singer's family breathed a sigh of relief in court on Tuesday as a jury decided that the Robin Thicke song 'Blurred Lines' ripped off Gaye's 1977 hit 'Got to Give It Up'. Following the decision, Gaye's ex-wife and children sat down for interviews to describe the emotional legal battle to stand up for his music and how they hold no ill-feelings towards the song's producer, Pharrell Williams. 'It's gratifying, I just felt filled,' ex-wife Janis Gaye told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Winners: Marvin Gaye's family say they are relieved by a court ruling, declaring the song 'Blurred Lines' infringes on the late Motown singer's work.  From left to right: Marvin Gaye's son Marvin Gaye III, daughter Nona Gaye, and ex-wife Janis Gaye . Overcome with emotion: Tears welled in Nona Gaye's eyes as she reflected on the multi-million dollar lawsuit . The success of the family's lawsuit in court is also sparking discussion online as to whether some of Pharrell's other work infringed on Gaye, with many drawing comparisons between his 2013 hit 'Happy' and Gaye's 'Ain't That Peculiar'. 'I'm not going to lie. I do think they sound alike,' Gaye's 40-year-old daughter Nona told Entertainment Tonight. While the family hears the similarities, they say they are not interested in going back to court anytime soon. 'We're not in that space,' Nona added. Furthermore, the Gayes are open to mending ties with Pharrell, and said they would be willing to include him in a tribute show to the late R&B star. In court on Tuesday, Nona Gaye cried in court as a jury decided to award her family$4million in damages and $3.4 million in profits from the song. Thicke will be forced to pay $1.7million from his own pocket and Pharrell $1.6million. Got to give it up: Robin Thicke (left) and Pharrell Williams (right) are seen leaving court last week during the trial. They were not present when the decision was read on Thursday . 'I feel free, free from...Pharrell Williams’ & Robin Thicke’s chains,' said Nona Gaye in an emotional statement outside the courtroom following the verdict on Tuesday . The verdict could tarnish the legacy of Williams, a reliable hit-maker who has won Grammy Awards and appears on NBC's music competition show The Voice. It was previously revealed that the song had made a staggering $16million for Pharrell, Thicke, rapper T.I. and the record company, though T.I. and various record and music companies had previously been cleared of copyright infringement charges. An attorney for Thicke and Pharrell has said a decision in favor of Gaye's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist's sound. All three later released a statement, saying; 'While we respect the judicial process, we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today, which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward. 'Blurred Lines’ was created from the heart and minds of Pharrell, Robin and T.I. and not taken from anyone or anywhere else. We are reviewing the decision, considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter.' 'Right now, I feel free,' an emotional Nona said after the verdict. 'Free from ... Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told.' Tragic death: Gaye, best known for such classics as Sexual Healing, I Heard It Through the Grapevine and How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You), was tragically murdered by his father when he was just 44-years-old . This was no doubt in response to the fact that Pharrell and Thicke had filed a lawsuit against Gaye's estate back in August 2013 in an attempt to stop his family from suing them for copyright infringement. 'Plaintiffs, who have the utmost respect for and admiration of Marvin Gaye, Funkadelic and their musical legacies, reluctantly file this action in the face of multiple adverse claims from alleged successors in interest to those artists. Defendants continue to insist that plaintiffs' massively successful composition, 'Blurred Lines,' copies 'their' compositions,' read the suit. This suit however was thrown out in October of that year, when a judge ruled that the family had made a sufficient showing that the two songs were similar. 'We did not start this fight… Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke started this lawsuit,” Busch said outside of the courthouse. 'We fought this fight with one arm tied behind our back.' Victory speech: Nona Gaye (second from left), daughter of late singer Marvin Gaye, and her lawyer Richard Busch (front right) speak to the media following the verdict on Tuesday . The Gayes' lawyer branded Pharrell and Thicke liars who went beyond trying to emulate the sound of Gaye's late-1970s music and copied the R&B legend's hit Got to Give It Up outright. He also brought up the fact after the verdict that the defense's legal team did everything they could to stop the jury from hearing Gaye's song during the proceedings, allowing them to just listen to certain snippets of the music. For this reason the infringement charge only applied to the sheet music for the two songs, making the case against Thicke and Pharrell that much more difficult for the Gaye family. Busch however pointed out during his argument that Thicke said in interviews while promoting the single that he and Pharrell were trying to write something like Gaye's Got to Give It Up. Thicke told jurors he didn't write Blurred Lines, which Pharrell testified he crafted in about an hour in mid-2012, as he was too high on painkillers and alcohol. 'The biggest hit of my career was written by somebody else, and I was jealous and wanted credit,' said Thicke. He also took time on the stand to play a variety of songs that sound similar in music and tone in an attempt to strengthen his case . Pharrell told jurors that Gaye's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth, but the seven-time Grammy winner said he didn't use any of it to create Blurred Lines and that the songs were alike in genre only. The pair's lawyer maintained their innocence even after the verdict, saying; 'They're unwavering in their absolute conviction that they wrote this song independently.' Heads held high: Busch, far left, walks with the late singer, Marvin Gaye's family members, from left, daughter, Nona, ex-wife, Jan, and son, Frankie, on Tuesday . According to the Los Angeles Times, he song brought in $5.6 million for Thicke, $5.2 million for Pharrell and another $5 million to $6 million for the record company, as well as an additional $8 million in publishing revenue . Gaye's children - Nona, Frankie and Marvin Gaye III - sued the singers in 2013 and were present when the verdict was read. The family had initially asked for $40million in damages, but later lowered that number to $25million. This was based on the amount of money they believed Gaye would have been paid had he signed off on the rights to his song. Gaye's ex-wife Janis testified that as soon as she heard the song she recognized the similarities and was thrilled thinking that this would introduce the music of her late husband to a new generation of music lovers. That quickly turned to anger however when she learned the rights to Gaye's song had not been licensed. Sales of the 2013 song, which has already sold 7.3million copies in the United States alone, are still going strong too, and have seen a drastic increase over the course of the trial this past few weeks. Gaye, best known for such classics as Sexual Healing, I Heard It Through the Grapevine and How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You), was tragically murdered by his father as he tried to break up a fight between his parents and protect his mother in 1984. The singer, just 44-years-old at the time, had been nominated for 14 Grammys at that point over the course of his brilliant but all too brief career, and left the rights to all his music to his three children. An appeal of the ruling is already being considered by Pharrell and Thicke's lawyer. Tom Petty Vs. Sam Smith: Smith's monster hit Stay With Me, a song which earned him three Grammys at this year's ceremony while also contributing to his Best New Artist victory, sounded a little to similar to the Petty classic I Won't Back Down, something the latter's lawyers picked up on and took to court. The two settled the entire thing like gentlemen however, coming to an agreement out of court that gives Petty and composer Jeff Lynne a writing credit on the track and 12.5% of the royalties. The Rolling Stones Vs. The Verve: The Verve became one of the biggest bands of 1999 thanks to their hit Bittersweet Symphony, a song which sampled strings from The Rolling Stone's The Last Time. The band however was told they could only use a five-note sample, and once they song was released were accused of breaking their promise and using more. As a result, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were given writing credits for the track alongside The Verve's Richard Ashcroft, and the group had to relinquish all royalties they received for the song. Queen and David Bowie Vs. Vanilla Ice: While Vanilla Ice remains a one-hit wonder, that hit, Ice Ice Baby, still receives massive play over 20 years after it was released by the rapper. The song clearly borrowed however from the David Bowie and Queen tune Under Pressure, something the rapper initially denied. The case was eventually settled out of court, and the details of the settlement were never revealed, though it is known that Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon and Bowie all now have songwriting credits. Bright Tunes Vs. George Harrison: In the biggest copyright infringement case prior to Tuesday's ruling, Harrison was accused of using the Ronnie Mack song He's So Fine in creating his solo song My Sweet Lord. The case dragged on for five years, ultimately making its way to a United States federal court, where Harrison lost and was forced to pay $1,599,987, a staggering amount at the time. Isley Brothers Vs. Michael Bolton: Bolton used elements of the Isley Brothers song Love Is a Wonderful Thing in his song of the same name, and as a result ended up having to pay $5.4million, when the case went to court, which before Tuesday was the largest amount ever awarded in a copyright infringement case.","On Tuesday, a jury awarded the family of Marvin Gaye $7.4million in their lawsuit against Pharrell and Robin Thicke .

"Vinegar can kill bacteria when new knee joints become infected . Vinegar isn’t just for livening up fish and chips — doctors are now using its key ingredient to treat infections in knee replacements. Surgeons in Cardiff are applying acetic acid to kill bacteria when new knee joints become infected, thereby reducing the need for further surgery. In the UK, 82,000 knee replacement operations take place every year. But bacteria can get inside the knee during surgery, causing infection — sometimes years later — leading to inflammation and swelling. Untreated, this can cause the joint to loosen and eventually collapse. If the infection is superficial, oral antibiotics can be prescribed, but some infections don’t respond. In such cases, surgeons’ only option is to remove the replacement joint, cut away dead tissue, wash out the knee (using saline, to sterilise, or iodine, which has antimicrobial properties) and put in a new joint. Sometimes, they can put in the replacement knee during the same operation, but this is usually done six to eight weeks later. In the meantime, the knee is packed with a special ‘cement’, which releases high concentrations of antibiotics to ensure the infection is killed. Each operation costs £15,000 to £20,000. Now, surgeons at University Hospital of Wales and Spire Cardiff Hospital hope that bathing the site with vinegar when they remove the infected joint means they can replace the joint in just one operation. Tests have shown that soaking the biofilm (the sticky layer of bacteria inside the knee) in this acid solution effectively kills the bacteria better than standard saline, says Rhidian Morgan-Jones, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at both hospitals. ‘We have treated around 25 patients in a prospective trial to show it is safe. 'They had no increase in heart rate, breathing or blood pressure — signs of pain — and no wound complications or delayed healing, suggesting that it was effective.’ Tests have shown that soaking the biofilm (the sticky layer of bacteria inside the knee) in vinegar effectively kills the bacteria better than standard saline . One patient who has benefited is Ron Spree, 69, a retired major in the Royal Army Physical Training Corps. After years of pain, in 2002 he had a left knee replacement on the NHS. But six weeks after the joint was put in, it began to ooze yellow gunge and he was diagnosed with an infection. Three months later, he had surgery to remove the joint and ‘cement’ was packed into his knee. Four months later, Ron had a third operation to give him a new knee joint. In the intervening months, he wore a splint to keep his knee straight and relied on crutches. Keeping the leg straight for so long made his skin shrink, so he needed a skin graft. For the next ten years, he was active as ever — ‘but three years ago, my knee began oozing again. Doctors said the dormant infection was back’. He was put on antibiotics, but these didn’t help. Eventually, Ron was told doctors could remove the infected prosthesis and fuse bones together to keep the leg straight — but, if that failed, they would have to amputate above the knee. Ron was horrified, so he sought a second opinion from Rhidian Morgan-Jones. ‘He told me he could take the infected joint out, bathe the knee in vinegar to kill the infection and replace the joint,’ says Ron. In December 2013, Ron had the two-hour operation privately. ‘Now, the oozing has stopped, my leg has healed and I’m out of pain,’ he says. Mr Morgan-Jones hopes that, in future, acetic acid may be used in all knee replacement operations to prevent infection in the first place. ‘It could also be used in other joint replacements, including hips, shoulders and elbows, to save the NHS large sums,’ he says. Nick London, consultant knee surgeon at Yorkshire Knee Clinic and Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust, says infection in knee replacement surgery is ‘a huge problem, affecting around 1 per cent of patients’. New research from the University of Edinburgh shows adding sugar to the saline solution used to wash out joints in orthopaedic surgery can protect cartilage and lower the risk of osteoarthritis . ‘Revision surgery to replace an infected implant is complex, costing several times more than the initial surgery, and involves longer hospital stays and long antibiotic courses. ‘Any method of making it more effective is welcome, since revision surgery to eradicate infection can fail in up to 20 per cent of cases. ‘A simple solution with vinegar sounds interesting, but this is a small study. We need much larger ones to show it works and does no harm.’ And vinegar’s not the only store cupboard staple finding its way into operations. New research from the University of Edinburgh shows adding sugar to the saline solution used to wash out joints in orthopaedic surgery can protect cartilage and lower the risk of osteoarthritis. Mr Morgan-Jones is planning to use sterile medical honey, Surgihoney, in revision surgery to replace an infected knee joint. ‘There’s evidence sugar can fight bacteria,’ he says. ‘It involves coating bones to create a hostile environment for bacteria, so they don’t stick to the implant initially — though we don’t yet know how long effects will last. ‘Sugar and vinegar have been used in medicine for centuries and don’t create resistance as antibiotics do.’","In the UK, 82,000 knee replacement operations take place every year .
Bacteria can get inside the knee during surgery, causing infection .
Untreated, this can cause the joint to loosen and eventually collapse .
Bathing   with vinegar means surgeons can replace  joint in one operation .
Acetic acid may be used in all knee replacement operations ."
"For years Steve Wozniak dismissed claims that technology, and particularly artificial intelligence, could threaten humans. But in a recent interview, the 64-year-old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human-like computers could be a dangerous reality. He even quipped: 'Will we be the gods? Will we be the family pets? Or will we be ants that get stepped on? I don't know.' Scroll down for video . Steve Wozniak (pictured) admitted he had previously dismissed claims technology will threaten humans in the next 30 years but now realises the predictions are coming true. He even quipped 'Will we be the gods? Will we be the family pets? Or will we be ants that get stepped on? I don't know' The Apple co-founder made the comments during an interview with Paul Smith at Australian Financial Review. He said: 'Computers are going to take over from humans, no question. If we build these devices to take care of everything for us, eventually they'll think faster than us and they'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently. He directly referenced warnings issued by both Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking about the threat AI has on humanity. The pair is part of a group of experts, known collectively as the Future of Life Institute, who recently drafted an open letter saying scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. The authors said there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. The 64-year-old said: 'Computers are going to take over from humans, no question. If we build these devices to take care of everything for us, eventually they'll think faster than us and they'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently.' Aldebaran's human-like robot is pictured . Mr Wozniak directly referenced warnings issued by both Elon Musk (pictured) and Stephen Hawking about the threat AI has on humanity. For example, Tesla boss Mr Musk said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will, instead, be controlled by robots . Earlier this month Tesla boss Mr Musk said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will, instead, be controlled by robots. The entrepreneur claimed that computers will one day do a much better job of driving and that humans are simply ‘too dangerous’ behind the wheel. In a paper called Robots are Us: Some Economics of Human Replacement, lead researcher Seth Benzell  said: 'Whether it's bombing our enemies, steering our planes, fielding our calls, rubbing our backs, vacuuming our floors, driving our taxis, or beating us at Jeopardy, it's hard to think of hitherto human tasks that smart machines can't do or won't soon do.' The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair (pictured) or a floor-level bed to a bath, for example . A recent report by management consulting firm Boston Consulting Group predicted by 2025 the number of 'automatable' tasks will rise to 25 per cent. This will lead to robots replacing many human jobs - and is a trend that has already begun in Japan. Earlier this week Riken-SRK Collaboration Centre for Human-Interactive Robot Research in Nagoya, Japan unveiled its latest Robear. The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but has enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor-level bed to a bath. It weighs 309lb (140kg) with extending legs that stop the 'bear' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms. And at the start of the month, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said it will begin employing a humanoid called Nao in its branches from April, on a trial basis. And if the trial is successful, the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the Japanese bank by 2020. Elsewhere, in China there is a hotel manned entirely by robots. From reception desk staff to security doormen and waiters, the Pengheng Space Capsules Hotel in Shenzhen, China, has built, rather than hired, new employees. Start-up costs and robot maintenance aside, staff bills are minimal and the hotel can pass these savings back to the customer as a night's stay costs just £6.80 per night. With this in mind, Mr Benzell and his colleagues at the National Bureau of Economic Research asked whether 'human replacement' - the act of building better versions of ourselves - will deliver an economic utopia or leave us earning too little to buy the goods the robots are making? Using a simulated economy, they found that the value of coders and developers will increase as the demand for smart machines rise. As processes improve and technology advances, the price to produce these machines will decline, which will deliver a 'tech boom'. This in turn will raise the demand for new code. But over time, the stock of so-called 'legacy code' will grow because so many people are working on the projects, causing an abundance. Plus this code will ultimately cause machines to become smarter and learn how to use the legacy code themselves. Using a simulated economy, a recent paper found the value of coders will increase as demand for machines rise. As tech advances, costs will decline to deliver a 'tech boom'. But over time, the stock of so-called 'legacy code' will grow causing demand for new code and high-tech workers to drop and see them replaced by robots . The eventual decline in jobs will limit what young people can save and invest. This means less capital will be available for the future generations and means production could actually fall over time, despite the fact machines are capable of producing goods more efficiently. A robot hotel employee in China is shown . This will cause demand for new code and, thus for high-tech workers, to drop and see such workers replaced by robot employees. 'The resulting tech bust reflects past humans obsolescing current humans. These robots contain the stuff of humans - accumulated brain and saving power,' said the paper. 'In fact, high-tech workers can start out earning far more than low-tech workers, but end up earning far less.' Artificial intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'. Now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity. The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. Stark warning: Professor Stephen Hawking says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence . The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research. 'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming. The paper uses the example of Junior, the reigning World Computer Chess Champion. Junior can beat every current and, possibly, every future human on the planet. Consequently, his old code has largely put new chess programmers out of business. The eventual decline in high-tech and, potentially, low-tech workers income will limit what young people can save and invest, continued the paper. This means less capital will be available for the future generations and production could actually fall over time, despite the fact machines are capable of producing goods more efficiently. An alternative outcome of this is that high-skilled workers will move into low-skilled, lower paid positions, which will force these low-skilled workers into unemployment. And once people are out of work, welfare costs will rise putting a greater strain on the economy. The authors suggest people start saving for this eventuality .

And once people are out of work, welfare costs will rise putting a greater strain on the economy. The authors even suggest people start saving for this eventuality. 'The long run in such cases is no techno-utopia. Yes, code is abundant. But capital is dear. And yes, everyone is fully employed. But no one is earning very much,' said Mr Bezell. 'In short, when smart machines replace people, they eventually bite the hands of those that finance them.'","Apple co-founder made the comments to Australian Financial Review .

"President Obama has revealed he heard the revelations Hillary Clinton used a private email account to conduct official state business at 'the same time as everybody else' when news reports surfaced. In an interview with CBS News during his trip to Selma, Alabama, he defended the former Secretary of State and applauded her decision to release the emails.

Clinton, seen as the front-runner for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2016, said on Wednesday she wanted the State Department to release the emails quickly. 'I think that the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need,' Obama said in the interview, versions of which will be aired on Sunday morning on CBS. 'The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the Blackberry I carry around, all those records are available and archived,' Obama added.

"A Virginia woman who barked online about her pup's experience at a dog obedience class  is now feeling the bite of a $65,000 defamation lawsuit. Jennifer Ujimori is being sued by Dog Tranquility in Burke, Virginia, after she took her puppy to obedience class and then wrote negative reviews about it on Yelp and Angie's List. Dog Tranquility's owner, Colleen Dermott, filed the suit because she claims Ujimori's reviews were false and they did her business harm. The business owner, Colleen Dermott (center), filed the suit because she claims Ujimori's reviews were false . Jennifer Ujimori is being sued by Dog Tranquility in Burke, Virginia, after she wrote a negative review on Yelp . Ujimori brought her dog Yuki, a Bolognese, to classes at Dog Tranquility because she wanted the then 14-week-old pooch to get more social so it could become a therapy dog, the Washington Post reported. According to Ujimori, her dog was not socialized correctly at the $175 basic obedience class and when she asked for a pro-rated refund, it never came. Ujimori wrote on Yelp: 'In a nutshell, the services delivered were not as advertised and the owner refused a refund.' She decided to make her plight public because she wants Virginia to pass legislation against 'strategic lawsuits against public participation', essentially suits that block free speech. Yelp has removed the review. In her lawsuit, Dermott claims she attempted to satisfy her customer and that the contract Ujimori signed had a no-refund clause. Dermott, 31, has two young children and is married to a solider. Some of the dogs she trains are used to help veterans with PTSD. Since news of the lawsuit leaked, Dog Tranquility's page on Yelp has been filling up with negative reviews . She said the negative reviews had a 'significant impact' on her small business. In a post about the lawsuit on Facebook, she wrote: 'I have attempted on numerous occasions to come to a resolution and avoid a legal suit. 'I understand that I cannot make everyone happy and I do not claim to do that, but her actions clearly show she is trying to drag my business and me through the mud.

"A woman who was raped by Adrian Ernest Bayley has told of her terrifying encounter with the killer, 11 years before he attacked and murdered Jill Meagher. A sex worker who was raped and abandoned naked in a Melbourne street by Bayley detailed the horrific incident. The woman said she had reached an agreement with Bayley, and got into a white van with him, according to the Herald Sun. Scroll down for video . Adrian Bayley, 43, has been convicted of raping and attempting to rape 12 women from 1991 to 2012 . He then punched her in the mouth and raped her, promising to kill her if she did not submit to his disgusting will. He called her a 'f**king slut' and again threatened to kill her if she reported the attack. Bayley reportedly then stripped her naked and dumped her in a lane-way. The woman said she recognised Bayley immediately when the haunting CCTV footage of Jill Meagher flashed across her television screen. A prison psychologist told Victoria County Court Bayley found pleasure in hurting and dominating his victims . 'That's him...that's definitely him,' she reportedly said. Details of the attack emerged after Bayley's horrifying history with sexual assault and violence came to light. On Thursday, he was convicted of a further three rapes committed in 2000 and in the months before Ms Meagher died. The predator - who pleaded guilty to raping and murdering Jill Meagher in 2012 - with a gross sexual appetite may have understood his victims' fear. As a child, Bayley was abused physically and possibly sexually. Bayley was born Adrian Ernest Edwards on July 14, 1971. He grew up in Melbourne with four younger siblings and an abusive father, who once smashed his son's head through a wall. Bayley told a prison psychologist he was also sexually abused from age nine to 15 by an older female, though this claim has not been verified. But he may have understood what his victims' pain as he was physically and possibly sexually abused . 'There is certainly evidence of physical abuse - in my opinion, some evidence of the possibility of sexual abuse,' psychologist James Ogloff later told Victoria County Court. A composite of Adrian Bayley released by police . Professor Ogloff believes Bayley's borderline personality disorder contributes to his impulsiveness and unstable self image. Bayley fantasises about assuming power and control over his victims, and the psychologist believes he derives pleasure from inflicting pain. His criminal record suggests this is the case. In total, Bayley has raped or attempted to rape 12 different women from 1991 to 2012. His first rape was committed just months after he walked down the isle in 1990, and a string of sexual assaults soon followed. Bayley spent almost two years in prison before being released in 1993 when he trained as a pastry chef. Bayley had two children with his first wife before they split. He married again, fathering another two children. He changed his last name from Edwards to Bayley in 2000, but returned to violent sexual crimes. In the early 2000s there were reports to police that a young, fit man was targeting prostitutes in St Kilda. He would drive them to a laneway, park so his victims could not escape, and then brutally rape them. When a judge jailed him in 2002, he said Bayley used threats and violence to satisfy his 'gross sexual appetite'. Bayley was released on parole in 2010, and was working as a labourer in 2012 when he attacked again. This time he killed Jill Meagher who was just 500 metres from her house when she was snatched, raped and brutally murdered by Bayley. The trigger for the murder of Jill Meagher was that she disregarded him. 'She flipped me off,' Bayley told police, in an attempt to limit his responsibility, 'and that made me angry, because I was actually trying to do a nice thing', according to The Age. Jill Meagher went missing in 2012 while she was walking home in Brunswick when she was attacked . Bayley pleaded guilty to the rape and murder of Jill Meagher who is pictured here with her husband, Tom . But Prof Ogloff told the court Bayley did appear to be sorry. The psychologist said it was quite common for people to be very remorseful, but to persist in engaging in that behaviour. Bayley seems to agree with the professor's analysis. 'They should never have let me out,' Bayley told police after confessing to killing Ms Meagher. 'How many chances does a person need?'

"The king of Saudi Arabia has handed his country's most-prestigious prize to a preacher who has previously said the Koran allows Muslims to have sex with female slaves. Indian cleric Zakir Naik, who has also said 9/11 was an inside job, was handed the King Faisal International Prize for Services to Islam at a glittering ceremony in Riyadh. A physician by training, the Mumbai-based 49-year-old has carved out a career as a charismatic television preacher, but his controversial views have led to him being banned from entering the UK. And the winner is... Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz presents Zakir Naik, president of the Islamic Research Foundation in India, with the 2015 King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam . Dr Naik was one of five winners presented a gold medal, a certificate hand written in Arabic calligraphy and an endowment of more than £130,000 by Saudi King Salman during a ceremony at a luxury hotel yesterday. The president of the Islamic Research Foundation in India, Dr Naik was honoured for being one of the most renowned non-Arabic speaking promoters of Islam. He founded the Peace TV channel, billed as the world's only channel specialising in comparative religion, which now reaches an estimated English-language audience exceeding 100million, according to his award citation. 'Islam is the only religion that can bring peace to the whole of humanity,' he said in a video biography aired at the ceremony. It was on a broadcast on Peace TV that Dr Naik suggested that Muslims men may rape their slaves. 'There are many verses in the Koran which say you can have sex with your wife and with whatever your right hand possesses,' he told a mass audience at one event. 'Right hand possesses,' he went on. 'Which means your slaves.' He goes on to qualify his statement by saying the world at the time of the Prophet Mohammed was beset by war, making slavery more common, and that a pious Muslim would marry the slave he wanted to have sex with first. But the remark seems to be a disturbing echo of the doctrines of the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency. Last October, the terror group published an article on its propaganda page stating that the sexual enslavement of captured Yazidis was justified because they are a 'pagan minority'. 'Enslaving the families of the kuffar (non-believers) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia,' the article pronounced. Inside the Islamic State: Last October, the terror group published an article on its propaganda page stating that the sexual enslavement of captured Yazidis was justified because they are a 'pagan minority' 'Inside job': Dr Naik has claimed the then-President George W Bush was behind the September 11 attacks . Dr Naik's controversial comments have extended beyond sexual politics. In a July 2008 Peace TV broadcast he suggested that Al-Qaeda was not responsible for flying hijacked airliners into New York's World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, killing almost 3,000 people. 'Even a fool will know that this was an inside job,' he said in the video, claiming then-President George W. Bush was behind the attacks. In 2010 Dr Naik was barred from entering Britain after the Home Secretary cited 'numerous comments' which showed his 'unacceptable behaviour'. During his acceptance speech at Riyadh's Al Faisaliah Hotel last night, Dr Naik told dignitaries he would be donating his prize money to Peace TV. The annual prizes are a project of the King Faisal Foundation, established in 1976 by the children of King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz who died in 1975. The other prize winners were: .

"Former rap music mogul Marion 'Suge' Knight's collapsed in a Los Angeles courtroom this afternoon after a judge ordered he be held on $25million bail in a murder case. Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher said his client, who is diabetic and has a blood clot, told him that he hadn't received any medication since Thursday. Fletcher said Knight, 49, hit his head on a chair when he fell after the bail hearing. Scroll down for video . Medical emergency: Los Angeles Sheriff's deputies rush to assist Marion 'Suge' Knight, as he suddenly fainted during an appearance in court for a bail review hearing in his murder case in Los Angeles Friday . Purported injury: Knight's attorney said his client hit his head on a chair when he fell . Was it sticker shock? The rap mogul fainted after a judge set his bail at $25million in light of his violent history . On his own two feet: Knight walked unassisted when he was brought to court for his bail hearing . Bailiffs cleared the courtroom after Knight's medical episode and paramedics were seen going into the courtroom a few minutes later. Fletcher said Knight was unconscious when the lawyer left the courtroom and an update on his condition was not immediately available. Knight fell while deputies were bringing him back into the courtroom after Fletcher asked a judge to reconvene a hearing and issue an order that Knight be given his medication. The attorney said Knight is being kept in solitary confinement without proper access to medication. 'He's being treated worse than Charles Manson,' Fletcher said. A prosecutor said she believed the defendant staged the fainting spell 'in front of the cameras,' reported the Los Angeles Times. Earlier this month, Knight was hospitalized after complaining during a court hearing that he was suffering from blindness. In all, he's been taken away from the courthouse by ambulance four times. Since his arrest in late January, Knight has been complaining of his treatment in jail, claiming that he was being kept in solitary confinement, deprived of hot water and blankets, and seldom allowed to bathe. Talking to NBC Los Angeles, Matthew Fletcher said that moments before his client's collapse, Knight appeared ill and said he had not been given his medication. 'He was dripping sweat, like someone poured a bucket of water on him,' the lawyer said. Dripping sweat: Knight, 49, appeared extremely sweaty in court during Friday's turbulent bail hearing . Ailing man: The murder suspect, pictured in court left and right, is diabetic and has a blood clot . Knight stands accused of intentionally running down two men with a pickup truck at a Los Angeles area burger stand January 29 following an argument on the set of a commercial for the film Straight Outta Compton. Terry Carter, 55, was killed after being struck by a Ford F-150, while Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, survived his injuries. The 49-year-old co-founder of Death Row Records has pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen set bail for Knight at a whopping $25million after Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes noted that Knight was on bail in a robbery case at the time of the hit-and-run crash. Knight's attorney argued that his bail should be set at $2million, telling the judge that had his name not been Suge Knight, prosecutors 'wouldn't have filed the case.' In seeking the multimillion-dollar bail, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office filed an extensive motion of 295 pages of legal papers and supporting material portraying Knight as a career criminal and repeated violator of probation and parole dating back to 1987. The motion alleges that Knight is ‘physically incapable of stopping his violent criminal behavior’ and that since being released from prison in 2002 he ‘has continued his repugnant life of crime.’ Claim of mistreatment: Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher said his client told him that he hadn't received any medication since Thursday . Cle 'Bone' Sloan (left) and Terry Carter (right) were the victims of the hit-and-run.

"From Cara Delevingne rocking a suit on the red carpet to Brad and Angelina wearing matching androgynous outfits to the BAFTAS, fashion icons have never been scared to experiment with gender. And one major retailing is jumping on the bandwagon by blurring the lines between men's and womenswear. Selfridges has launched a 'gender-neutral' fashion campaign encouraging consumers to buy clothes without being restricted to men's or women's fashions. Scroll down for video . Selfridges has launched a 'gender-neutral' fashion campaign encouraging consumers to buy clothes without being restricted to men's or women's fashions as it opens the doors to its 'agender' shopping space . The Oxford Street department store has axed its separate women and menswear departments in favour of three floors of unisex fashion. Selfridges believe that shoppers no longer want to be defined or limited by their gender as to what they can wear. Instead, they are able to shop for unisex or 'agender' clothing and the store describe the new concept as a celebration of fashion without definition. As part of Agender, Selfridges has created a unique genderless shopping experience across fashion, accessories and beauty.

Customers are invited to shop for unisex or 'agender' clothing and the store describe the new concept as a celebration of fashion without definition . Devised by renowned designer Faye Toogood, the space is an environment in which shoppers are given the freedom to transcend notions of 'his' and 'hers', as you simply find your most desired item by colour, fit and style. Selfridges has launched five unisex collections and 'agender' pieces from forty of its regular brands. Beauty products and accessories for men and women will also be mixed. Among the unisex lines on offer - many exclusive - is a capsule collection by Bodymap, the U.K. launch of Nicola Formichetti’s collection Nicopanda, a collection from footwear label Underground and Rad Hourani’s made-to-order couture designs.

'For us, Agender is not about harnessing a ""trend"" but rather tapping into a mind-set and acknowledging and responding a cultural shift that is happening now,' explained a Selfridges spokesperson. 'We will explore the relationship between gender and retail physically, digitally and in all of our stores. 'The project will act as a test bed for experimentation around ideas of gender – both to allow our shoppers to approach the experience without preconceptions and for us as retailers to move the way we shop fashion forward.'

Cara Delevingne has long championed androgynous style and rocked cigarette pants and a shirt at the Brits this year, left, whilst Angelina Jolie matched her suit to husband Brad Pitt's at last year's BAFTAS . It comes as Selfridges bosses say they have seen a huge surge in women buying menswear as part of the trends for looser clothing and more masculine tailoring this year. Photography, film, music and design pieces exploring the idea of gender are also on display in all four  stores and on Selfridges.com throughout the campaign. Brands at the store, such as KTZ, Trapstar and Hood By Air, are already popular with women looking for a more androgynous style.

Jane Shepper, chief executive of Whistles, which has collaboration with Swedish company Stutterheim to create unisex raincoats, said the line between men and womenswear was becoming blurred. 'A lot of our men's collection influences our women's and vice versa,' she added. Cos and Gap have all noticed increases in the number of women buying menswear, while men have also been picking up women's knitwear for themselves. While there has been a swathe of high-profile unisex models, such as Elliott Sailors, who work for both mens and womenswear brands.","Selfridges has launched a 'gender-neutral' fashion campaign .

"Rene Enriquez (pictured)  is currently serving two life sentences for murder.The black hand tattooed on his chest is the symbol of the Mexican Mafia . The Los Angeles Police Department used an invalid court order and spent $22,000 to bring an imprisoned killer and former gang leader to speak to an exclusive dinner for business executives, according to a report released Friday. In all, 38 LAPD employees worked about 320 hours to prepare for the January event at a downtown building and protect Rene 'The Boxer' Enriquez, 52, while he was there, the inspector general of the city's police commission wrote. What's more, the department didn't have authority in the first place to remove Enriquez from custody because it used an order from a 2012 murder case that has been closed — and in any case only allowed his release to act as a witness — the departmental watchdog's report said. Enriquez, an ex-Mexican Mafia leader who has been in prison since 1993 and is serving two life sentences for murder, has gained allies in law enforcement. California Governor Jerry Brown has acknowledged Enriquez's past cooperation with authorities but denied him parole last month, saying his history of violence meant he still presented 'an unreasonable danger to society if released'. The decision came despite letters of support from the FBI and several federal prosecutors. Formed in the Californian prison system in the 1950s, the Mexican Mafia has a reputation for extreme violence. Enriquez worked his way up from enforcer to a leader in the organization - which is also known as La Eme - before his arrest and conviction. After two decades in the gang he defected in 2003 and began helping police by describing the hierarchy and methods used by the gang. After the January event, Los Angeles Police Commission President Steve Soboroff has called for an investigation into the incident and called the episode 'embarrassing'. 'There were some decisions made that in retrospect were the wrong decisions,' Soboroff said. The Los Angeles Police Department used an invalid court order and spent $22,000 to bring Enriquez, pictured in an undated file photo, to speak to an exclusive dinner for private executives, according to a report released Friday . He called the LAPD's involvement in the event as 'very, very misconceived and surprising' and a 'giant waste of public resources'. In recent years, Enriquez had talked to various groups of officers and provided valuable information on the transnational criminal enterprise to which he once belonged, Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Michael Downing said in the days after the event. On Friday, the department issued a short statement, saying that Chief Charlie Beck had asked his professional standards bureau to launch its own investigation. Beck already had said the department's role in the event was a mistake. The watchdog agency revealed new details about the event that almost immediately attracted criticism from the mayor and police commission president. According to the report, a commanding officer at LAPD characterized the event in December as a law-enforcement training session in asking Beck to approve the use of department resources, which he did. Those resources would eventually include officers making three visits to Enriquez before he spoke, a police helicopter to scout his route to the building, and SWAT officers who secured the area. The event attracted 175 people invited by a chapter of the Young Presidents' Organization, which describes itself as 'the world's premier peer network of chief executives and business leaders'. Four LAPD officers attended, as did ten other 'high-ranking law-enforcement executives' from other agencies. The invitation promised a once-in-a-lifetime chance to hear a mystery guest, promising that attendees would be 'amazed, shocked, blown away and maybe even a little scared'. Inside the room, the presentation included some theatrics. 'Silhouetted behind a screen, Enriquez described how an organization creates, delivers, and accumulates value economically, socially, and culturally,' the report said. 'It was not until the curtain was lifted that the audience saw Enriquez standing on a small stage, in a black business suit, with his hands cuffed to waist chains and his legs in shackles.' The LAPD headquarters in Los Angeles (pictured). Los Angeles Police Commission President Steve Soboroff  called the episode in which Enriquez was given a police escort 'embarrassing' Once the handcuffs were removed, Enriquez explained who he was and how the Mexican Mafia worked. NBC News reported that a source who attended the session said Enriquez had the air of a 'corporate leader' who provided 'a rare look into life of a criminal corporate executive'. In a statement to NBC News, LAPD said: 'The purpose was to learn how a transnational criminal enterprise was built, branded and marketed. 'It is the hope that we can learn and develop better strategies to counter these threats to our region.' The source who attended the event said Enriquez discussed 'gang franchising, marketing, sales, merchandising and branding.' Afterward, guests went for a buffet dinner. They were allowed, in pairs, to meet Enriquez, who signed copies of a 2009 book about his life. Enriquez rose from low-level thug to a major player in the organization as his reputation for violence grew and he served time in prisons such as San Quentin and Folsom. Just one of his many tattoos, the black hand on his chest is the symbol of the Mexican Mafia. In 1993, Enriquez pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder and is serving life in prison. In a 2008 interview with the BBC he said: 'I believe I'm a cut above the rest. 'As a Mafioso, you have an elitist, arrogant mentality. 'That's how you carry yourself in the Mexican Mafia - you walk into a room and everybody knows you're a leader.' On Friday, Los Angeles Police Commission President Steve Soboroff credited the police chief for taking 'the action necessary to do a thorough personnel investigation.' The commission is an independent civilian board that oversees the department.","Rene Enriquez, 52, known as 'The Boxer' was a leader in the Mexican Mafia .

"A new campaign on Twitter that rallies against the current foodie trend of serving up meals in novelty dishes is gathering momentum. Steaks laid out on slabs of slate, gooey puddings on planks of wood or even dinner on a gardening spade...the backlash against domestic items being used as tableware is being spearheaded by @wewantplates, a Twitter account that is the brainchild of journalist Ross McGinnes. In just a week, Mr McGinnes, from West Yorkshire, has already attracted some 5,000 followers with his series of witty ripostes to restaurants who have dared to inject a large portion of gimmick into their presentation of meals. Scroll down for video . Kitsch? Or just plain irritating? This photo of a mini garden bench was posted on the @wewantplates Twitter account, which is biting back at restaurants who use novelty ways to present food . Who pinched the plate? And the cutlery? A southern feast is served up on a solitary sheet of grease-proof paper with a little shopping trolley full of chips on the side . Fancy that, it's bread in a hat: One Twitter user was left aghast when they were served a selection of bread in a flat-cap, presumably one that hadn't been worn . He says: 'I set the account up a week ago after a friend posted a picture on Facebook of an average-sized steak, which had been served to him on a large chopping board. 'It was captioned, without irony, ""That is a big meal!"" 'It wasn't a big meal - he'd fallen for all this style-over-content nonsense. I searched Twitter for an account which would allow me to vent my spleen with like-minded people, but found nothing. 'We Want Plates was born, and has already topped 5,000 followers.' Diners rankled by the imagination of the restaurants they've eaten in have been quick to send in shots of their own experiences, with bread and butter served in a flat cap, afternoon tea perfectly placed on a mini garden bench and a communal portion of spaghetti served straight on to the table top. Started just a week ago, the Twitter account, run by Ross McGinnes from West Yorkshire, has already attracted plenty of attention from disgruntled diners calling for a return to simple plates . Mamma mia! This Italian restaurant takes the words communal and table to the limit, with diners invited to tuck into a sharing portion of spaghetti and sauce on the bare surface . A crate idea? Tartare sauce in a tiny watering can, peas in a plant pot and fish and chips in a wooden box and (right) a delicate starter is served atop a piece of stone . No it isn't bedtime, yes, this is part of your dining experience. A surprised diner tucks into 'a yoghurt ice cream ""brush"", mint-eucalyptus crème ""paste"" and a gin and tonic' at a restaurant in Germany . He adds: 'I’m certainly not looking to challenge any small businesses by ‘outing’ them for their chopping boards or mini shopping trolleys of chips. The only ones that I’ve named directly, or retweeted, are the bigger chains. I’m sure they can rise above it.' One chef willing to put his head above the parapet, Michael Wignall who runs The Latymer at Pennyhill Park Hotel in Bagshot, Surrey, said that diners would miss the inventive ideas if chefs returned to more simple tableware. 'Why do people want different clothing or cars? Why not all drive around in the same one! After all, they all do the same job don't they? Food is about the whole experience, we all like individuality and chefs are no different.' So how does Mr McGinnes actually think restaurants should present their food? With little fuss, it seems. 'Simple white plates and a well-pressed, clean table cloth. Is that too much to ask?.' Food can look great in mason jars (but is a pain in the @rse to eat) says Ross . Tea time with a difference: This deconstructed brew was served with milk in test tubes . Cheesy feet anyone? Brie balls served in sudded Camper shoes might be one step too far . Looks sharp! Butter slivers served on a broken bathroom tile won't wash with WeWantPlates . Cosy crusts: Switzerland likes to serve bread slippers in restaurants . The chopping board where it all began: Not a terribly big meal, just a 'normal-sized meal inexplicably served on a large piece of wood,' tweeted Ross .

"When you first enter your hotel room, it's tempting to immediately head toward the minibar, brew yourself a cup of coffee or raid the toiletries that have been supplied for you. But, before you get carried away, there are a few things that you should know. Your stately room is likely not as clean as you believe it to be. And those goodies you're eager to try out? They may not actually be free. MailOnline Travel reveals the most important things to know about your hotel room, including those that no one will ever tell you... Hotel rooms may appear clean, but there are certain areas the cleaning staff don't often have time to inspect . Beware when touching the television remotes and light switches . A study by the University of Houston revealed that the most touched places in the room such as television remotes and bedside lamp switches are often the least cleaned. Results found that in some cases, they had as much bacteria as bathroom toilet seats and sinks. That's enough for us to remember to pack our hand santizer whenever we travel! Pack your sanitizer for items like remotes and light switches which are hot spots for germs . Drinking from the bathroom glasses . You may be tempted to quench your thirst when you arrive and use the bathroom glasses for a drink. However in an expose by Fox News, it was revealed that many hotel maids do not wash them out with soap before the next guest checks in. Hidden cameras revealed glasses that were rinsed only with water, or that were wiped down with a cloth that had previously been used for cleaning the room. Use bottled water, or request plastic cups from reception to be safe. Think before you snuggle up in the blankets . Due to a lack of seating area in some hotels, the bed becomes the place where most people sit, eat, and perform other, ahem, intimate activities. Some mothers even change their child's nappies on the blankets, too. While you have no need to worry about items that get washed daily, some of the smaller blankets may not get replaced that often. It is advisable to check user comments before staying at a hotel so that you are aware of the experiences of other guests. Don't assume that everything is free . Everyone loves to stock up on the hotel-provided shampoo, shower cap and biscuits, but guests should never assume that everything is up for grabs. While pens and brochures are often free to use and take, items such as bathrobes, slippers may not be. Travelodge have noted a number of items being taken out their rooms that are supposed to remain. Shakila Ahmed, Travelodge spokeswoman said: 'Since we have introduced our new brand design and modernised our rooms, we have seen a significant rise in our fluffy pillows, snuggly duvets, striped bed runners and contemporary artwork being taken from our 500 UK hotels. 'There have even been attempts to smuggle our new luxurious king size Travelodge Dreamer bed out of the hotels.' Don't threaten to leave a bad TripAdvisor review in change for perks . Unfortunately, some people resort to blackmail to receive upgrades and free perks, in exchange for not writing a negative comment on the hotel's TripAdvisor page. If you are tempted to use this technique, take note: hotels have a way of proactively reporting any threats before a corresponding review is submitted. A spokesperson for the online review site said: 'It is absolutely against the terms and spirit of our site to use TripAdvisor's name to try and claim discounts or freebies that would not be available to other guests. 'Our fraud detection experts will then investigate and, where we find evidence of threatening behaviour, take action to stop their reviews from ever reaching the site.' The mini bar items are extremely over-priced for what you get, bring your own snacks for guilt-free feasting . Keep your name and room number private . Telling other guests your full name and room number can lead to unwanted visitors and charges finding their way to your room. Set your own wake up call . On occasion, the front desk will forget to call you for your 3am flight reminder. Eliminate the risk and set your phone alarm yourself. Take hand santizer . Even if the room passed the cleaning inspection, there are still corners that the staff may not have reached. Keep yourself protected and always carry a bottle on trips. Request the top floor or a corner room . The top floor rooms tend to have higher ceilings, better views and less noise than other rooms. Corner rooms also tend to be larger - regardless of the floor its on. Tip generously . Leaving a little something for the staff gives a great impression and shows that you're grateful for their service. Plus, it doesn't hurt for them to remember your generosity when you have a request during your stay. Don't go crazy with the minibar . When you're nice and cosy, it can be tempting to see what the minibar has to offer, as opposed to leaving the room to explore other snacking options. However, prices of items in the fridges are often exorbitant, and can leave you regretting that last little packet of peanuts when you get the bill. Before indulging, remember this: The 2014 TripIndex Survey found that average price for nuts in Switzerland, France, New York, Canada, Singapore and Sweden was over $10. Topping the leader board was Toronto, where the average bag of nuts cost an unbelievable $18.23. And don't add your own items . For savvy travellers who bring their own items instead of perusing the (expensive) minibar options, beware. You could still be hit with a large charge. Several hotels have a restocking fee to dissuade you from placing personal items in the fridge. Last year it was revealed that hidden fees were set to earn hotels £1.4bn in revenue add-ons, a six per cent increase from 2013. A study by  a professor at New York University's hospitality school noted that although these fees only add an extra two per cent in revenue, most of that money is pure profit for the hotel. Blogger Keri Anderson was horrified to find that there was a charge to placing personal items in the fridge . Be careful when using the coffee machine . An investigation by ABC News showed cleaners simply swirling the pots in water without properly cleaning them, which leads to a build up of bacteria. In Cincinnati, Ohio, one cleaner was found to have cleaned the pot with a bottle of Lysol mildew remover, and another was captured using the same cloth to clean the coffee maker as she had used to clean the bathroom floor. Always clean the machine yourself before use - even if it had been cleaned after the last user, it could have been sitting around collecting dust for a few weeks before you arrive.","Studies show that TV remotes can house as much bacteria as a toilet .
Some minibars will charge you for storing your own items inside .
Using advice sites, like TripAdvisor, to get free perks can actually backfire ."
"Death: Adam Cullen is believed to have accidentally hanged himself by his hoodie in a 'rare' incident . A 17-year-old boy accidentally hanged himself by his hoodie in a ‘rare and freakish’ incident, an inquest has heard. Adam Cullen is believed to have died within seconds after the bow he had tied on the drawstring on his hooded top caught on a latch of his rear garden gate. The teenager’s family found his lifeless body outside his home in Beeston, Nottingham, and his death was said to have left an ‘enormous gaping hole’ in the lives of everyone he knew. Adam was a ‘very happy and fulfilled young man’ and there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death, Nottingham Coroner’s Court was told yesterday. The talented photographer was wearing a sports hoodie with lacy-type threading and had been suffering from a stomach bug. Detective Inspector Elizabeth Rogers, who investigated the incident for Nottinghamshire Police, said it was a ‘tragic accident’. She added: ‘The fashion is currently to have [the hoodie strings] tied in a bow at the neck. Adam and his friends were all wearing their hoodies like that.’ Nottinghamshire Coroner Mairin Casey said: ‘What appears to have happened is that after he had entered the gate of this property, he’s either tripped or - because he was unwell - fainted in some way. ‘In the most rare and freakish event the string of his hoodie caught the latch of quite a high gate, which is about six or seven feet tall.’ A post-mortem examination found he died on February 6 by asphyxiation, caused by hanging. Teenager: Adam, from Beeston, Nottingham, was an 'exceptional' roller skater and talented photographer . Tragic case: A post-mortem examination found Adam died on February 6 by asphyxiation, caused by hanging . Adam - described as an 'exceptional' roller skater - was a student at Bramcote College, where flowers, pictures and personal tributes were left after his death. Miss Casey, recording a verdict of accidental death, said: ‘This is a most unusual situation and probably even more especially tragic on account of this. He was a popular, healthy and happy young man with a fulfilled life, close family and very close friends. ‘His death has left an enormous gaping hole in his community and school environment - all have expressed positive feelings and memories about Adam.' Remembered: Adam, described as a talented inline-skater, was a student at Bramcote College in Nottingham, where flowers, pictures and personal tributes were left after his death last month (above) Adam - who was the son of Jim, 71, and Trish Cullen, 55 - previously attended Beeston Fields Primary School and Alderman White School. He was due to finish college this summer. Bramcote College headteacher Paul Heery said: ‘He was clearly a boy of many talents. In particular he was an exceptional roller skater who had a reputation for excellence that had spread far and wide, and a keen and talented photographer who had built up an impressive portfolio of work. ‘However, as well as this, he was funny, generous, and a true and loyal friend. Everyone who knew him spoke of the pleasure he brought to those around him and how he lit up every group he joined, and everyone is conscious of the empty space that he leaves behind.’","Adam Cullen died seconds after bow on drawstring got caught on latch .

"Jasem Emwazi has been told to publicly distance himself from his son or leave Kuwait . Kuwaiti MPs yesterday called on Jihadi John’s father, Jasem Emwazi, to publicly distance himself from his son’s actions by apologising – or leave the country. Kuwaitis have become increasingly frustrated with the mixed messages coming from 51-year-old British citizen Mr Emwazi, whose family are said to have cost the British tax-payer up to £400,000 in the 20 years they have lived in the UK. Last week, Mr Emwazi told former workmates his son was a ‘dog’ and hoped he would die, yet a few days later, his lawyer in Kuwait suggested there was ‘no proof’ the masked IS executioner-in-chief was in fact 26-year-old Mohammed. Yesterday, Abdullah Yousef Al-Maayouf, a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly and chairman of the country’s Parliamentary interior and defence committee, called for Mr Emwazi to apologise or leave. He said: ‘Kuwait is a safe, peaceful country and does not want to be associated with Mohammed Emwazi. What he has done is not his family’s fault, but they should apologise on his behalf and say they do not agree with it. ‘If they will not say this publicly, they should leave Kuwait.’ Mr Emwazi is believed to have been living in Kuwait with his eldest daughter Asma, 25, for the last two years while his wife Ghaneya and four other children remained in London – now guarded by armed police in a hotel. Westminster council is reportedly still paying the rent on the family’s £600,000 flat even though the rules say housing benefit should normally be stopped after 13 weeks. As members of the stateless Bedoon ethnic group, the Emwazis were granted asylum in the UK, claiming to have fled Kuwait in fear of persecution. Scroll down for video . Former Kuwaiti MP Safa Al Hashem urged Mr Emwazi to ‘speak openly’ about his son and apologise. ‘From what we read, he has said one thing to his friends at work, then another in public,’ she said. ‘Whether an apology from him would be accepted by people is not certain, but he should make one anyway. ‘I think it would be better if he went back to the UK and spoke to the police and security services there about what he knows.’ Meanwhile, Kuwaiti government adviser and security expert Dr Fahed Al-Shelaimi, a retired army colonel, said he believed Mr Emwazi would return to the UK within days. Killer: Mohammed Emwazi, left in the most recent photograph known to have been taken of him before he entered Syria to join ISIS militants. He has appeared in a number of the terror group's films (right) Mr Emwazi has both described his 26-year-old son (above) as a 'dog' and claimed there is no evidence to prove he is the hooded killer shown in ISIS films . ‘Kuwait wants to distance itself from Mohammed Emwazi and officials here consider it a largely British issue. He was born here but brought up in London. ‘His father’s presence in Kuwait is embarrassing for the country. The Kuwaiti government doesn’t want the headache, so will ask him gently to leave the country. ‘Jasem has already quit his job, and people are cursing his son – I doubt he will be able to stand the heat and I expect he will leave soon. In 90 per cent of cases when people are asked to leave here, they go quietly.’ Neither Jasem Emwazi or his lawyer, Salem Al-Hashash, were available for comment yesterday.","Jasem Emwazi has been told to apologise for his son by Kuwaiti officials .

"A Chinese man who was embroiled in a three-way tug of love between his current and ex girlfriends was forced to choose between the two women when they both jumped in a river and demand he save them. Wu Hsia, 21, had broken up with long-term girlfriend Jun Tang, 20, after meeting new love Rong Tsao, 22, in the city of Ningbo in eastern China's Zhejiang province. But Jun had taken the split badly and, over the following three months, engaged in a campaign of harassment in an effort to make her beau leave his new girlfriend. Saved: Jun Tang - the ex-girlfriend - emerges from the river covered in mud alongside Wu Hsia's brother . Fed up with the grief he was getting from both sides, People's Daily Online reports that Wu arranged to meet both women at a local beauty spot to clear the air and make it clear where his loyalties lie. But Jun forced the issue by throwing herself into the river - and Rong quickly followed suit. The incident echoed a common Chinese custom that revolves around men being asked who they would rescue if their mother and their lover both jumped in a river. Wu said: 'I was sick of being nagged from both sides. 'Rong was moaning about Jun and Jun was moaning about her and it all go too much.' Ultimatum: Jun had jumped in the river in the hope her ex-boyfriend would save her . Muddy: But he chose his current girlfriend, leaving Jun to be rescued by his brother and fire services . But when they got to the river, the situation went from bad to worse. A police spokesman said: 'The girls began arguing and the man's ex-girlfriend felt insulted by a comment made by the new girlfriend, and so she jumped into the river calling for her former lover to save her. 'The new girlfriend, fearing that he might indeed jump in to save his ex-lover, then jumped in as well and both of them within calling for him to rescue them from drowning.' Wu settled the matter by jumping in the water to save his current girlfriend, ringing his brother to ask for help in pulling out the ex. According to a firefighter who attended the incident, Jun - stuck up to her waist in mud - calmly rang a friend at this point to tell her she was stuck in the river. The friend then rang emergency services. The fireman said: 'We found a woman mired to her chest in mud - about 20 meters away from the riverbank.' Rescuers were forced to tie a rope round Jun to haul her out of the mud. Judging by the brief conversation Wu and his ex had after the rescue, his problems may not be over. According to the fireman, Wu said to her: 'We broke up 4 months ago. Why you still bother me?' She replied: 'I want to bother you.' Current girlfriend Rong required hospital treatment for minor injuries after hitting a boat as she jumped into the river. The story quickly went viral in China, where there is a chronic shortage of single women because the country's one-child policy meant parents preferred male babies. As a result there is a surplus of millions of single men who will never marry as, normally, they cannot find partners.","Wu Hsia had left long-term girlfriend Jun Tang just three months before .

"The Australian family of Bali Nine drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have made the long journey to visit them on Indonesia’s ‘death island’. Chan and Sukumaran are awaiting their execution by firing squad on Nusakambangan, in Cilacap, off Central Java, while they hold out desperate hope that a last ditch legal appeal will bring them mercy. On Channel 7's Sunday Night it was revealed Sukuraman knows the identity of 'Mr Big' - the ringleader of the heroin syndicate he was convicted of being part of - but has never wanted to name him publicly as he feared for the safety his family.

Indonesian police stand guard to secure the area around Kerobokan prison in Denpasar on Bali island on March 4 . Their deaths triggered Chan to ask: 'I guess sometimes you kinda got to think, what does it take to get a second chance? 'People get second chances within their lives on the outside, but how much can you get when you’re a convicted criminal.' Since they were sentenced to death, Chan converted to Christianity and studied to become a pastor while behind bars.

"The United Nations has withdrawn from Yemen and dozens of diplomats evacuated after a third night of Saudi-led airstrikes blasted rebel positions in the country's east. Ambassadors and international officials were shipped out of Aden to the Red Sea port of Jeddah last night, escaping the city where president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi had taken refuge before leaving for Egypt to shore up Arab support for his crumbling authority. Last night's bombing increased the campaign's death toll to 62 - while the conflict slowly widens in scale as Iranian-allied Houthi fighters attempt to overthrow Yemen's Western and Saudi-backed Hadi. It comes as Yemeni government officials claimed it was 'very possible' ground troops may be needed in the next stage of the coalition's campaign against the fighters. Flames and smoke billow from an arms depot in Aden destroyed by the Saudi-led bombing campaign . The explosions at the depot, aimed a slowing the advance of Houthi rebels, killed at least nine people .

Foreigners stand patiently beside their luggage as they await evacuation flights in the Yemeni capital Sanaa .

More than 100 staff were evacuated yesterday, according to a United Nations source . In the capital Sanaa, which has been under Houthi control since September, more than 100 U.N. staff were evacuated, a United Nations source said. Airport staff said dozens of other foreigners working for international oil companies and NGOs also flew out to Ethiopia and Djibouti. On Friday, the Houthis and allied army units gained their first foothold on Yemen's Arabian Sea coast by seizing Shaqra, 60miles (100km) east of Aden, allowing them to open a new front to march on the south's main city. Riyadh's intervention, a surprise move from a conservative monarchy better known for flexing its muscle in oil markets than through military might, is planned to last a month but could extend for five or six, a Gulf diplomatic source said. He said satellite imagery had shown that the Houthis had repositioned long-range Scud missiles in the north, close to the Saudi border and aimed at Saudi territory. Yemen's Health Ministry said more than 62 people had been killed and 452 wounded in the city since Wednesday, while Human Rights Watch claimed the lives of 'at least' 11 were lost overnight. Meanwhile, explosions rocked Aden's . largest arms depot today, sending flames and smoke into . the sky above the southern Yemeni city, witnesses said. Fire and explosions could be seen at the Jabal . Hadeed compound, which is close to residential and commercial . properties, but there was no immediate word of casualties.

Local residents said the convoy had been stopped, but the Houthis were sending reinforcements to Shaqra and the advance along the main al-Mukalla-Aden road was expected to resume. At an Arab summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Hadi urged Yemen's army to protect state institutions and obey the orders of Yemen's 'legitimate leadership'. He also underlined the regional dimensions of the conflict, calling the Houthis 'Iran's puppet'. Saudi Arabia's intervention is the latest front in its widening contest with Iran for power in the region. Their proxy struggle is also playing out in Syria, where Tehran backs Bashar al-Assad's government against mainly Sunni rebels, and Iraq, where Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias are playing a major role. Many residents are fleeing the city as the proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran intensifies .

Saudi Arabia's King Salman told the summit the operation would continue until Yemen achieved peace and security, while Kuwait's emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, said the Houthi advances 'pose a threat to our security'. After the summit, Hadi flew with King Salman to Riyadh, rather than trying to return to Aden. Iran has denied giving the Houthis military support, but Alaeddin Boroujerdi, head of the Iranian parliament's national security and foreign policy committee, added to the sense of confrontation, saying: 'Saudi Arabia is too small to be able to threaten Iran. 'We utterly condemn Saudi Arabia's attack on Yemen and it will end in failure,' he was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency. A Gulf diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Arab alliance initially planned a month-long campaign, but it could last up to six months. He said Iran was likely to retaliate indirectly, by encouraging pro-Iranian Shi'ite activists to carry out armed attacks in Bahrain, Lebanon and eastern Saudi Arabia.

The official says a U.S. helicopter flew Thursday from neighboring Djibouti to the Gulf of Aden and rescued the airmen. Initial reports said the rescued airmen were 'ambulatory.' The destroyer USS Sterett took lead of the situation after Saudi Arabia requested U.S. assistance Thursday afternoon, coordinating assets from the U.S. naval base in Djibouti and the amphibious transport dock USS New York. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the operation by name and requested anonymity, had no information on the two airmen's status or why they ejected from their plane.","United Nations staff and diplomats have been evacuated from Aden, Yemen .

"A white supremacist who has been charged with three murders entered a plea of not guilty in court on Friday. Frazier Glenn Miller, 74, is charged with capital murder in the April 13, 2014, shootings at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, Kansas, and at the nearby Village Shalom Retirement Center. Miller, also known as Frazier Glenn Cross, is a Vietnam War veteran from southwest Missouri who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party. None of the victims of the 2014 shooting that took place on the eve of Passover, a week-long holiday in which the Jewish community celebrates their freedom from slavery in Egypt, were Jewish. Scroll down for video . Frazier Glenn Miller (above) entered a plea of not guilty for charges of capital murder in the killing of three individuals on April 13, 2014 . Miller, a supremacist, allegedly opened fire outside a Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kansas screaming 'Heil Hitler!' Miller (mugsghot above), who says he is ill and does not have much time to live, also asked for a speedy trial . On Friday, Frazier also asked for a speedy trial and to have Internet access while he is in prison. The judge granted him the right to a speedy trial, which will begin August 17, but denied him Internet access. Miller said he would go to trial in 30 days if he could represent himself. Overland Park police Sgt. Marty C. Ingram testified earlier this month at a preliminary hearing that he heard shots fired at the Jewish Community Center and saw the doors of the center's theater shatter. He said he took cover as more shots hit the building's facade back on April 13. 'Dust, smoke was flying everywhere at that point,' he said. The gunman then drove away. When he heard that fellow officers had arrested a suspect, Ingram accompanied some witnesses to the arrest scene to determine if they could identify him. As they approached the patrol car where Miller was detained, he shouted 'Heil Hitler!' and asked how many Jews he had killed. Miller is accused of killing Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, who were attending a singing contest audition at the community center. He also is accused of killing 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the nearby Jewish retirement home. Miller (above in 80s) was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car . At a December hearing, Miller, who has emphysema, said he was afraid that he doesn't have much time left to live following a trip to the emergency room in March. Miller previously served three years in federal prison on weapons charges and for planning the killing of the Southern Poverty Law Center's founder. He was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car.","On Friday, Frazier Glenn Miller entered a plea of not guilty for charges of capital murder in the killing of three individuals on April 13, 2014 .

Travis Sattler, 18, was working  his shift at Freddy's Frozen Custard and Steakburgers in Katy, Texas when a little boy came up to his register and counted money he hoped would pay for a mini mint Oreo custard .

"The White House claimed today that the United States should be feared by ‘extremists’ in Yemen – even though the last remaining special forces have been evacuated from the country ‘because it is dangerous.' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that ISIS-linked groups will have American to deal with if they carry out more attacks in the war-torn country, which is split between Sunni and Shia Muslims. U.S. officials 'had to relocate from Yemen because its a dangerous country,' Earnest said Monday. 'But I'll tell you, that as of today, Yemen remains a dangerous country for extremists as well.' Earnest said there continues to be continues to be 'ongoing security cooperation' between the U.S. and the 'national security infrastructure' of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whose power has been crippled in recent months after Shia rebels initiated a coup-d'etat. The U.K. also pulled its special forces out of the country, following the United States' lead, leaving Hadi and his loyalists to face extremist and rebel threats to the country on their own. Tribal militiamen loyal to Yemeni President Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi stand on a tank positioned in the southern city of Lahj on Monday. The militiamen have reportedly been deployed around the city of Lahj, along the border with Taiz city which was captured one day ago by Shiite Houthi rebels. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi has called on his supporters to mobilise towards the south of Yemen . Yemeni protesters shout slogans and set alight tires during clashes following a protest against the Houthi takeover of several state facilities in the central city of Taiz, Yemen, on Monday. According to local reports a day after Houthi rebels took over the strategic central city of Taiz, capturing several state facilities including the city's airport, airbase and a court complex, residents took to the streets to protest their presence . In pushing back against claims that the U.S. is flying blind in Yemen now that it's 'temporarily relocated' its special forces the president's spokesman assured reporters that the the country 'continues to have assets and resources in the region that will allow us to take steps where necessary to continue to apply pressure necessary to extremist targets and to keep the American people safe.' House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul had said a day before on ABC News program this week that the result of the complete withdraw is that 'we will have no intelligence footprint or capabilities to monitor' what Sunni al Qaeda affiliates, known in the country as AQAP, ISIS and Shia 'militants are doing in the region.' 'Good intelligence stops plots against the homeland,' he said. 'Without that intelligence, we cannot effectively stop it, that’s what I’m most concerned about.' Earnest said Monday afternoon that its 'true' that he US would be a 'more effective' force against extremists if military personnel were still in the country - but it 'doesn't mean that coordination has been eliminated.' The White House said it has proven its ability to fight threats in other countries, including Syria and Somalia, without troops on the ground and it will do the same in Yemen. The U.S, has already shown that it will take extremists 'off the battlefield in Yemen when they pose a threat to the United States.' 'Those efforts continue, and our capability to carry out those kinds of actions persists to this day as well.' Yemenis carry a coffin during a funeral for the victims of Sanna Mosque Attacks  in Sanaa, Yemen, on Monday. The Yemeni people held a funeral for those who were killed in suicide bombing attacks in Sanaa on Friday. The Islamic State says it launched the bombing attacks that killed at least 154 people and wounded 350 others but the White House disputes that the terrorist group was involved . Yemenis and members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene of a suicide attack on Saturday in Yemen . U.S. officials 'had to relocate from Yemen because its a dangerous country,' U.S. President Barack Obama's chief spokesman, Josh Earnest, said on Monday. 'But I'll tell you, that as of today, Yemen remains a dangerous country for extremists as as well.' The remarks follow the United States' removal on Saturday of special forces from the country . The White House's insistence that its counter terror strategy in Yemen, which the president propped up as a success story last year, and the region is still effective came after the country's security situation took a turn for the worse over the weekend. On Friday four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 people and injured hundreds more when they walked into the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in the capital city of Sanaa and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country. A fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques. ISIS has since taken responsibility for the attack, but the White House said Monday it has not seen evidence to support the group's claims. More likely, it said, is that ISIS is taking credit for the assault 'merely for propaganda value,' not because it had any direct involvement. Hundreds of members of al Qaeda also managed to escape from Yemeni prisons on Thursday and Friday. In addition, Shia rebels that have taken over large parts of the country, the Houthis, issued a call to arms on Saturday to fight Yemenis loyal to embattled President Hadi. The U.S. and U.K. responded to the disturbances by recalling special forces from the country. CNN reports that Navy SEALs and members of the Army's Delta Force are among personnel who were at the Al Anad airbase in Yemen and have since been sent out of the country. The United States had already closed its embassy in Sanaa last month. This after years spent working with Yemen in a quest to topple the terrorist organization al Qaeda, AQAP, in the Arabian Peninsula. AQAP claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shooting earlier this year in Paris. Members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene inside the mosque of one of Friday's suicide bombings . Further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. The Houthis are a Shia group that earlier this year gained power in the country after taking over the government in a struggle that some believe was funded by Iran. The White House says it does not know how much support Iran is providing the Houthis but it does not appear to be controlling their operational movements. In January of this year, the Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace, and by February they had taken control of the government. It was at that point most Americans were ushered out the country and the embassy was shuttered. The Houthis launched a new strike against Hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of Aden, the country's temporary capital. That same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of President Hadi and Houthi rebels battled in the same city. Then on Saturday, the Houthis issued a call to arms to attack supporters of President Hadi following a speech he gave, one of his first in weeks, in which he accused rebels of carrying out 'a coup against constitutional legitimacy.' He also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the Saudi city of Riyadh and announced a plan to place a national flag in the city of Sa'dah, the Houthi base. Above all else he said he wanted unity for the country. Sunday the United Nations' special envoy for Yemen to the international organization's security council that the country was on 'the edge of civil war. 'Following the suicide bombings and fighting, emotions are running extremely high, and unless a solution can be found in the coming days the country will slide into further violent conflict and fragmentation,' the envoy, Jamal Benomar, said. Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yaseen on Monday reportedly asked the country's neighbors to help the government fend off rebels militarily. Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi delivers a speech calling for unity on Saturday . Hundreds of Yemenis chant slogans and hold placards as they protest the suicide bombings on Saturday . The White House reaffirmed its belief on Monday that Hadi is 'the rightful leader of Yemen' and pointed to a United Nations statement issued over the weekend that echoed the policy position. The U.S., Earnest said, hopes along with the international community that the Houthis will stop their rampage 'and participate in the UN-led effort to try to resolve the differences of all the parties there.' Asked if the U.S. had plans to designate the Houthis as a terrorist group, Earnest directed reporters to the State Department. 'What we have been focused on are the serious concerns that we have about the destablizing activity of the Houthis,' he said of the president's advisers, and 'we could encourage both sides, including the Houthis, to put an end to the violence and come to the negotiating table.' Should they decide to participate in the peace process, Earnest said the U.S. and the U.N. would be involved 'so that we can end the bloodshed, that we can end the violence, and try to bring some stability to this nation that's been racked by so much instability over the years.'","U.S. officials 'had to relocate from Yemen because its a dangerous country,' the White House spokesman said. 'But I'll tell you, that as of today, Yemen remains a dangerous country for extremists as as well'

"A Danish tourist has died after trying to save a Michigan mayor from tempestuous waves on a beach in the Virgin Islands. South Lyon Mayor Tedd Wallace was pulled under the water while body-boarding in St Croix last Sunday. Rushing to his rescue was 70-year-old Gvind Matson, a Danish man on holiday with his wife to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their first kiss. Mr Wallace, 63, said Mr Matson also got caught in the choppy waters and as they both tried to cling to the board, he lost grip and never resurfaced. Rescue:  Mayor Tedd Wallace (right) was caught up in waves when a Danish man (not pictured) called Gvind Matson rushed to save him. He too got caught and never resurfaced. Bale Shbaka Kaza (left) came to his aid . Tribute: Mr Wallace posted this tribute to Mr Matson on Sunday afternoon after speaking to his widow . 'He didn't hesitate and took off after me,' Mr Wallace told The Detroit News. 'When he got to me we were both hanging on to the board and trying to paddle towards shore. I don't think we even said anything to each other. Suddenly he let go and went under. I think he had a heart attack right then.' He added: 'I feel so sorry for that man. 'Someone who gave their life for me ... I've been doing a lot of crying this week.' Another man, Bale Shbaka Kaza, eventually spotted Mr Wallace and rescued him from the rocky-based ocean with bare feet. Mr Matson's widow, Annette, said he likely had an epileptic seizure.

Writing on Facebook, Mr Wallace, a retired teacher, said: 'I want to say thankyou to so many unbelievable good wishes sent me and for prayers offered to Danish man Gvind Matson and family in his valiant effort to rescue me from the rip tide. 'I am so sad. 'His widow Annette sent me a kind email and said he may have had epilepsy seizure at the moment he arrived to me explaining his sudden plunge below surface. 'Bale Shakabaka was my other hero who for reasons he can't figure why had climbed up on rocks and spotted the trouble and scaled 200 feet of sharp rocks in bare feet to reach out and save me.

"The mother of a one-year-old Maryland boy found dead inside a backpack in an Ohio creek pleaded guilty Friday to involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering. Dainesha Stevens, 25, is trying to take responsibility for her own inaction when a male friend of hers beat 14-month-old Cameron Beckford, according to her defense lawyer Mark Collins. The man, who has not been charged,was trying to rid the toddler of demons, the lawyer said. Scroll down for video . Mother Dainesha Stevens, 25, pleaded guilty Friday to involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering . Fourteen-month-old Cameron Beckford was found dead in Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, Ohio in 2014 . The little boy wasn't found until New Year's Eve, but he was badly beaten on Christmas and left the next day . The man believed Cameron had demons and beating him was the only way to get rid of them, Collins said. Stevens agreed to cooperate and be truthful in any proceedings against that man, who is expected to be indicted and face prosecution in Franklin County, Collins said. Collins said: 'It was the first step for her taking responsibility for her inactions... and not doing more to protect her child.' She also has a seven-year-old daughter named Cheyenne. The father of Stevens' two children reported them missing after she had fled to Columbus in mid-December to stay with her friend Kurt Flood. Stevens may receive a 12-year prison sentence . Columbus police found Cameron's body on December 31 in Big Walnut Creek. Flood was held on an unrelated misdemeanor charge after the body was found and has not been charged in relation to the child's death at this time. The coroner said the boy had bruises on his lower back, kidneys and lungs, and bruises and scarring on his buttocks. His mother initially told police she left the boy on a stranger's porch but later changed her story, directing police to the creek and providing more information about the man who had beaten her children. The man injured the toddler on December 25, and when Stevens found the boy unresponsive the following day, they put his body in the bag and left it in the water nearby, Collins said. The prosecution and defense are recommending a 12-year prison sentence for Stevens, whose sentencing is scheduled July 23. She would be eligible to seek judicial release after nine years if she has no problems in prison, Collins said. Cheyenne also reported being beaten by the man and is now back in Maryland with her father.","Cameron Beckford was found dead in Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, Ohio .

"Scientists say sharing sad emotions helps women bond. Pictured: Film The Fault In Our Stars . It has long been a mystery to men why so many women enjoy watching tear jerker movies with their friends. But now scientists have come up with a suggestion – sharing sad emotions helps women bond. A research team at Cardiff University found that by sharing their emotions women found the happy parts of films more joyful and the sad bits less sad. Job van der Schalk, a psychologist at Cardiff University, said: ‘Our findings suggest that a negative emotional experience such as watching a ‘weepy’ is more positive when it is shared with a friend. ‘And, at the same time, a positive emotional experience, such as watching a ‘romcom’, should equally be more pleasant when shared.’ The study involved 30 pairs of female friends aged between 20 and 33 who were shown emotionally powerful images and asked to rate them on a scale from ‘very negative’ to ‘very positive’. The scientists put one of each pair in a brain scanner to monitor their reactions, and the volunteers were also asked to view and rate the images while on their own and also while together. The researchers found the images were seen more positively when the pairs were together, The Sunday Times reported. The study, published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, said: ‘When people go to the cinema to watch a film, they ... anticipate a positive subjective impact of sharing this emotional experience.’ And Hollywood success seems to back the theory. The 2008 film Marley and Me, which surrounds a couple’s relationship with their dog, took £160m at the global box office, and last year’s film The Fault in Our Stars - about two teenage cancer patients who find love - took more than £200m. Aggie Romeril, 22, a London beauty manager, said: ‘I think we’re a “stream it and weep” age. You scroll through Netflix, find who’s got the biggest laptop and bundle into a housemate’s bed for a sob session.’ Marley and Me, which surrounds a couple’s relationship with their dog, took £160m at the global box office.

"In the children's wing of any hospital a sick child's smile can be a very rare commodity. Lea Boyce can attest to that after she spent years going back and forth between hospital and home with her young daughter Sophie. When Sophie was only three-years-old she put her delicate hand on a running treadmill and it gave her a nasty friction burn which required years of medical attention. She was referred to the Royal Melbourne Children's Hospital to see a burns specialist but never expected to be treated by a doctor with face paint and pink hair. Scroll down for video . Sophie, right, spent years nurturing a relationship with her favourite clown doctor, left, Doctor Fairy Floss . On her first visit she met Dr Fairyfloss and Dr Fantastic, two colourful clown doctors who spend their days brightening the lives of children who need it the most. 'We were having to drive 5 hours to get to the hospital every week so the fact that you could spend the 5 hours talking about which clown doctor would be there was a great distraction and  therapy for her.' Sophie required painful and constant dressing changes and eventually ended up having surgery to release scar tissue after her middle finger started to retract. Sophie told Daily Mail Australia the clown doctors always went above and beyond doing 'anything they could' to give her and the other kids in the hospital a 'break from reality.' 'There would be some pretty bad things happening to me and it would hurt quite a lot but the clown doctors would totally take that away and make it fun.' 'There's no doubt in our minds that they had a massive impact on her physical healing by first nurturing her heart and emotions.' 'They would play with the equipment or have little things in their pockets that were really gross! They would tell me jokes and sing songs, even play the ukulele.' Doctor Fantastic, left, and Doctor Doctor would do anything in their power to lighten the mood . She said having the clowns around meant she looked forward to hospital visits as opposed to fearing them. After watching her daughter  emotionally connect with the clown doctors during such a challenging time in her life Ms Boyce said she was certain the doctors had a massive influence on Sophie's emotional well being. 'There were days where Sophie was having procedures to her hand and the clown doctor's were having difficultly distracting her so they would start finding medical instruments in the room to play sword fights or even throw water balloons on the roof.' 'There's no doubt in our minds that they had a massive impact on her physical healing by first nurturing her heart and emotions.' Ms Boyce said she found it challenging to describe exactly what the clown doctors did because it was more than just what they did, it was about how they made her daughter feel. 'Each day it was something different. There are times when she needed that big, bold slapstick comedy and there were others where they would sit quietly singing a song.' Sophie,left, was only three-years-old when she started coming to The Royal Melbourne Children's Hospital . The doctors were shocked by how quickly Sophie's hand healed and Ms Boyce attributed this to Sophie's overall happiness during her treatment. When a young child is forced spend a lot of time in hospital the experience can leave an emotional scar but Ms Boyce said, in Sophie's case, that couldn't be further from the truth with her experience really becoming 'a big part of who she is.' 'Sophie is very caring and community minded. She learnt that it's important to care for others and what kind of difference that can make in people's lives,' said Ms Boyce. Blue Steel: Sophie said having the clown doctors around made the experience less harrowing . She said Sophie became so involved with the clown doctors that she even started dressing up and joining in herself. 'It was kind of like I was one of them. You know when you're younger and you dress up as what you want to be when you're older? It was just like that.' 'They're my role models,' she added. Sophie said it can be hard for adults and parents to really understand what the clown doctors do but in her opinion 'they really do change lives.' Lou Pollard, who  goes by the name of Dr Quack, is one of sixty clown doctors prescribing doses of fun and laughter across 22 major hospitals in Australia. Long-time clown doctor Lou Pollard is more commonly known as Dr Quack around Sydney's child wards . She said being a clown doctor is all about 'making a connection' with children who may be going through 'the worst time of their lives.' 'International research has shown the physiological and psychological benefits that laughter brings to patients,' she said. 'It's our job to change the mood by having an open-hearted connection with kids who are often scared and really don't know what's going to happen.' 'If a kid is going to be in hospital, we want that child to go home having had the best experience they can possibly have' In what she calls 'diversional therapy', Ms Pollard and her collegues interject play, adventure and fun into an often bland and sterile hospital environment. 'You can take them on a playful journey and transform their room into a magical place.' 'If the doctor is putting a canular in the left arm, we will stand on the right and take them away from that medical procedure.' She said the added benefit is that it takes a lot of pressure off doctors who can do their job far more efficiently if their patient isn't distressed. 'If a kid is going to be in hospital, we want that child to go home having had the best experience they can possibly have,' Ms Pollard added. After spending years in the business Ms Pollard maintains humor therapy has 'measurable medical effects.' 'We've seen kids become very jaded and bitter about being in hospital and the pain they are going through and a lot of the time they are missing their friends and family back home. 'Bringing them back to a child like state where they can experience fun and joy really reminds them that they're still just little kids.' Some lucky Australian cricketers got the chance to see the good work the Clown Doctors are doing first hand after sending Steve Smith, Brad Haddin and Nathan Lyon to Randwick Children's hospital to test out some of Ms Pollard's terrible dad jokes. Spreading the joy: Some of Australia's best cricketers joined Dr Quack at the Randwick Children's Hospital . Children aren't the only patients the clown doctors end up treating either. Ms Pollard said their presence also gives parents a chance to take a time out of what can be 'an extremely overwhelming situation.' 'Adults are often terrified and worried about what will happen to their kids. If you have an incredibly worried parent and the kids see that and start to wonder what are they keeping from me?' Ms Boyce said she was surprised by the relief she felt every time a Clown Doctor came to visit Sophie. 'When you're in the hospital you are absolutely focused your child. You are frightened and concerned for them and it can be really hard to be the strong one in such a stressful environment.' She said the clown doctors create a sense of calm which gives parents the rare opportunity to see their kid with a smile on their face. Relieved: Ms Boyce said she felt a sense of calm when the clown doctors came to visit Sophie . Sophie and Ms Boyce are so passionate about spreading joy in hospitals all over Australia they have spent a considerable amount of time advocating for the alternative medicine. 'The sort of medicine the clown doctors dispense is just as important as the medicine the hospital is dispensing,' said Ms Boyce. 'As long as there are kids in hospitals, clown doctors need to be in hospitals.' While clown doctors are working in every major children's hospital across the country, they don't always get  to spend as much time there as they would like. Ms Pollard said clown doctors spend three or four days of the week in some major hospitals but some others are lucky to get one day of comedic relief a week. 'The only complaint we hear is why aren't you around more often?' said Ms Pollard. Laughter is the best medicine: Ms Pollard says clown doctors need to be in hospitals full time . The Clown Doctors are a not-for-profit organisation and receive no government or hospital funding so donations are vital to their continued existence. Ms Pollard said she was thrilled to see CommBank come on board to try and get clown doctors into more wards across Australia. Preying on societies obsession with selfies Comm bank have pledged to donate $5 to the Clown Doctors for every silly selfie posted on Instagram or Twitter before April 2 as long as it has the hashtag #ClowningForKids. They are aiming to raise a massive $200,000 to further fund the clown doctor operation. The hastag has already gained momentum with strangers from all over Australia posting pictures of themselves clowning around. Australian cricket great Michael Clarke got involved with this selfie earning the Clown Doctors five dollars . After spending years in the industry Ms Pollard said she goes to work every day knowing her job is a 'privilege.' 'You can’t change what has happened to them but you can change the way they looked at the world that day.’ Donations to the Clown Doctors can also be made at any CommBank branch until the end of March or online at commbank.com.au/clowndoctors.

"Google users will have the right to sue the internet giant in British courts over its 'clandestine' tracking of their browsing, the Court of Appeal has ruled. A group known as Safari Users Against Google's Secret Tracking want to take legal action in the English courts over the way Google tracks users of Apple Safari's internet browser. They accuse Google of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and to target them with personalised advertisements. The group believes a landmark ruling in their favour now opens the door for litigation by millions of internet users. Ruling: Google users will have the right to sue the internet giant in British courts over its 'clandestine tracking of their browsing (file picture) Three  judges have dismissed Google's appeal over a High Court ruling against it and ruled claims for damages can be brought over allegations of misuse of private information. Today's ruling was a victory for Safari Users, including editor and publisher Judith Vidal-Hall, and Robert Hann and Marc Bradshaw, who are both IT security company directors. They say Google's 'clandestine' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and early 2012 led to distress and embarrassment among UK users. They accuse Google of collecting private information without their knowledge and consent by the use of 'cookies' - a small string of text saved on the user's device. Dan Tench, a partner at law firm Olswang, which represents the group, is quoted by the Times the landmark ruling potentially 'opens the door for litigation by millions of British Apple users'. He said the case decides 'whether British consumers actually have any right to hold Google to account in this country'. Mr Tench added: 'This is the appropriate forum for this case - here in England where the consumers used the internet and where they have a right to privacy.' A group of internet users want to sue Google, claiming the internet giant secretly tracked their browsing habits in order to bombard them with targeted adverts. The claimants, known as Safari Users Against Google's Secret Tracking, all used Apple's Safari browser and have accused Google of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and target them with adverts. Google was accused of misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws . They say that cookies, small tracking files, were installed by Google on the Apple computers and mobile devices of those using the Safari internet browser without their knowledge. Cookies are used by advertisers, and owners of other websites, to target advertising based on an individual's internet use. The campaigners also say that Google's 'clandestine' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 led to distress and embarrassment among UK users. The claimants accused Google of misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws. The appeal judges unanimously ruled that misuse of private information was a tort - a civil wrong - for the purposes of the rules governing service out of the jurisdiction, enabling legal action to go ahead. They also clarified the law on the meaning of 'damage' in section 13 of the Data Protection Act. Lord Dyson, Master of the Rolls, and Lady Justice Sharp said in their joint judgment, with which Lord Justice McFarlane agreed: 'On the face of it, these claims raise serious issues which merit a trial. 'They concern what is alleged to have been the secret and blanket tracking and collation of information, often of an extremely private nature... about and associated with with the claimants' internet use, and the subsequent use of that information for about nine months. 'The case relates to the anxiety and distress this intrusion upon autonomy has caused.' Three judges have dismissed Google's appeal over a High Court ruling against it and ruled claims for damages can be brought over allegations of misuse of private information . The appeal judges said Mr Justice Tugendhat, who heard the case in the High Court, was entitled to come to the view that it was 'clearly arguable' that Article 8 (right to private life) of the European Convention on Human Rights was engaged and gave weight to allowing the claims to proceed. The judges also said Google Inc had estimated its trial costs at £1.2million, which seemed 'extremely high' and they could be controlled by the court's management powers. They said some of the technical issues in the case may already have been addressed by litigation against Google in the US over the Safari issue. In August 2012 Google had agreed to pay a civil penalty of $22.5million (£15.1million) to settle charges, brought by the United States Federal Trade Commission that it misrepresented to users of the Safari browser that it would not place tracking cookies or serve targeted advertisements to those users. In November 2013 it also agreed to pay $17million (£11.4million) to settle US state consumer-based actions brought against it by the attorneys general representing 37 states and the District of Colombia. After the latest ruling, a Google spokesman is quoted by the Times as saying: 'We're disappointed with the court's decision and are considering our options.'","Group claims Google bypassed security to track their online browsing .

"A prisoner who overpowered a guard at a Virginia hospital before escaping custody has been caught in Washington D.C. following an eight-hour manhunt. Wossen Assaye, 42, allegedly stole two cars in Virginia before he was recognized by a passerby and apprehended getting off a Metrobus  in southeast D.C.  at 11.30am on Tuesday. He was wearing a hospital gown under street clothes and still had on an ankle chain when he was taken into custody without incident, a source told WUSA9. Assaye had escaped the Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church at 3am. He had been receiving treatment for a broken nose at the hospital after trying to hang himself in his Alexandria City Jail cell last week following his arrest for a series of of bank robberies on March 20. Scroll down for video . Found: Wossen Assaye, left, overpowered a guard at Inova Fairfax Hospital on Tuesday and a massive search was launched. He was tracked down in Washington D.C. about eight hours after his escape . Police had hired a private security company to guard the shackled 42-year-old while he was at the hospital,  but he managed to overpower a female guard while a male guard went to the restroom. During a scuffle, one shot was fired but it is not clear who pulled the trigger. No one was hurt. The hospital was put on lockdown as hundreds of officers searched for him. But the lockdown was lifted after a woman reported being carjacked several miles away around 7am. It emerged that Assaye had fled from the hospital to a nearby residential neighborhood and had broken into the trunk of her car, police said at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. When she got in the car and started driving, Assaye kicked through the back seat and forced her out of the vehicle. Terrified, she crashed the car into a nearby home and got out. The man, who took off in the vehicle, was wearing a hospital gown, she told police after fleeing to a nearby gas station for help. Her car - a 2002 Toyota Camry - was later found on a street nearby with the female guard's stolen firearm inside, police said. Assaye then allegedly stole a second vehicle, a dark gray Hyundai Elantra with Virginia plate XTU-5024, which authorities are still trying to locate. Scene: Assaye had been at Inova Fairfax hospital (pictured) early on Tuesday for treatment after harming himself while in jail. He had been arrested on March 20 in connection with a series of bank robberies . Hunt: A Virginia State Police officer hunts for the accused bank robber in Fairfax after his escape . Dramatic: An officer from the U.S. Marshals fugitive task force hunts for Assaye on Tuesday morning . Crash: After carjacking a vehicle, Assaye allegedly drove across this resident's lawn on Cindy Lane in Annandale - near to the hospital - and smashed into this parked car, its owners said . Police said he also changed into regular street clothes - a dark colored jacket and blue jeans. As they searched for him, Fairfax Police called Assaye 'armed and dangerous'. They initially said he may be with his girlfriend and released her photo early  but later determined that was not the case. But when he reached Washington D.C., he was seen by a civilian who recognized him from media coverage and called authorities. Assaye was then apprehended. Police released this image of his girlfriend and said they may have been together - but they were not . Authorities said they continue to investigate how he managed to get out of his shackles. Assaye had been arrested on March 20 charged with a robbery at Apple Federal Credit Union in Alexandria. But in a court document, an FBI agent suggests Assaye is responsible for a string of 12 bank robberies in northern Virginia over the last year and a half. In court documents about the robberies, the FBI agent said the robber seen in surveillance photographs and video recordings is 'physically similar' in the dozen robberies and the one at the Apple Federal Credit Union. In all, the banks were robbed of approximately $32,000. In most cases, the agent said the robber entered the bank with a cellphone to his ear, demanded money and fled with cash on a bicycle. Following his March 20 arrest, Assaye was booked into the William G. Truesdale Adult Detention Center in Alexandria and remained there until he tried to take his life on Friday. Alexandria deputy sheriffs maintained custody of Assaye for the first 24 hours before turning him over to security officers contracted by the U.S. Marshals, Alexandria Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Amy Bertsch said. Following his escape, police locked down the hospital and closed nearby roads to search for him and asked people in the area to call police with information about anything suspicious. The lockdown at the hospital, which is  10 miles southwest of Washington D.C., was lifted at 8am. Caught: Assaye, 42, has a long rap sheet and is now accused of robbing 12 banks of $32,000 . Armed: A Virginia State Police officer is pictured hunting for the accused bank robber before he was caught . Task force: Virginia State Police, U.S. Marshals and FBI agents searched neighborhoods after his escape . Search: Fairfax County Police stand guard outside the hospital as the manhunt got underway . Schools in the area are on spring break. Kent Knoff, a worker at a nearby Exxon, told NBC that police had swarmed the area. 'There are police cars everywhere,' he said. 'We've been having the door locked and got a message from police to stay inside.' Assaye has an 'extensive criminal record' and 'history of violence,' indicating a 'serious risk to the community', according to a 2012 Virginia Parole Board document seen by NBC. Records show he was convicted for snatching a purse in 1994 and given a recommended 12-month jail sentence and was accused of breaking and entering in 1998, NBC reported. His Facebook page says he lives in Arlington and studied at George Mason University in Fairfax.","Wossen Assaye has been caught  on a Washington D.C. street nine hours after he escaped custody and sparked a manhunt early on Tuesday .

Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture' (e) + 'letter' (moji). Icons . are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as . a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white . flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji . representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese . curry, and sushi. Some . emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them . to be used elsewhere including websites and apps such as Facebook and Twitter. The keyboard is the latest in a long line of apps and services related to emoji. Last year a pair of London-based developers created the Emojli app that only let users communicate using the popular miniature images. Even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons. And with the release of iOS 8 Apple allowed app developers to create emoji-based keyboards for iPhones, iPads and iPhones. A study in April last year found that the top trending word, at that time, was emoji. There are now apps dedicated  to the small images.

"Seven Marines and four soldiers were presumed dead on Wednesday after an Army helicopter crashed during a night training exercise in Florida. A UH-60 Black Hawk crashed in the Gulf of Mexico close to Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday night. The area  was under a fog advisory when the crash took place. Foggy conditions remained on Wednesday morning which was hampering the search, Eglin public affairs specialist Sara Vidoni said. A military spokesperson told Daily Mail Online that human remains had been found during the search but could not confirm the identities or number of people. Debris from the crash washed up on shore Wednesday, including landing gear and the side of the helicopter with the glass from the windows missing. Scroll down for video .

Thick fog: The are was under fog advisory when the crash took place. Military officials who spoke with Daily Mail Online says local pilots are used to the conditions but the pilot who was flying at the time was from Louisiana or North Carolina. Above, a file photo of a UH-60 Black Hawk - not the one that crashed . Hard to see: Military personnel wade in the water and search on the beach under heavy fog at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida on Wednesday . Evidence: A man walks the beach near where debris washed up Wednesday morning following the helicopter crash, and appears to be picking up remnants of the crash . While a Pentagon official said the men were presumed dead, the hunt for the crashed helicopter remains a search and rescue mission and not search and recovery. Base officials said the Marines were part of a Camp Lejeune-based, 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion from Jacksonville, North Carolina. The soldiers were from a National Guard unit based in Hammond, Louisiana. The massive Black Hawk has been the workhorse of the U.S. Army since 1979. They are primarily used to ferry troops to and from the battlefields, and support aircraft, but adapted models carry out medical evacuations with state-of-the-art equipment, search-and-rescue, armed escort and warfare missions. Black Hawks were a central part of the U.S. military attack on Somalia capital, Mogadishu in 1993. They were also used in military operations in the Balkan region and Haiti in the 1990s; and supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The aircraft has also been used prominently by the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq. There are manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft based in Stratford, Connecticut. It flies low to the ground to avoid detection and its twin-turbine engine can deliver a maximum speed of roughly 180mph. During an afternoon press conference, Major General Glenn Curtis of the Louisiana National Guard confirmed that all of his soldiers were male and that three had aided in the Hurricane Katrina response. He described his men as 'tremendous pilots' and 'tremendous soldiers' Two Black Hawks took off together from the base ahead of the crash on Tuesday night. It is unclear how many soldiers were on board the other aircraft. A military spokesperson told Daily Mail Online that training missions usually took off from Eglin on a daily basis and said that it was up to individual units whether to fly in adverse weather conditions such as heavy fog. Fog was common in the region, the spokesperson said, and local pilots were used to the conditions.  The pilot on the Black Hawk which crashed on Tuesday night was from either Louisiana or North Carolina. The helicopter was reported missing around 8.30pm on Tuesday and search and rescue crews found debris from the crash around 2am on Wednesday. Kim Urr, 62, who works at the nearby Navarre Beach campground, said she heard a strange sound, followed by two explosions around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. 'It sounded like something metal either being hit or falling over, that's what it sounded like. And there were two booms afterward, similar to what you hear with ordnance booms, but more muffled,' Urr said. The tail rotor of the helicopter with its ID number was found during the rescue mission, according to military officials. Names of those involved were not immediately released, pending notification of next-of-kin. But Mike Spinks from Eglin Environmental Public Affairs told WKRG: 'There is always hope.' The Army helicopter took off from a nearby airport in Destin and joined other aircraft in the training exercise. The UH-60 helicopter went down during a routine training mission off a remote stretch of beach between Pensacola and Destin. Two helicopters were flying a night training mission, but only one of the helicopters returned. Above patrol boats search the waters near the crash site on Wednesday .

Seven Marines and four soldiers aboard an Army helicopter that crashed over waters off Florida during a routine night training mission were presumed dead on Wednesday . The search for the missing Black Hawk helicopter was being hampered by heavy fog in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday morning . The beach is owned by the military and is used for test missions. The training area includes 20 miles of pristine beachfront that has been under the control of the military since before World War II. Military police keep a close watch on the area and have been known to run off private vendors who rent jet skis or paddle boards without permission. Test range manager Glenn Barndollar said in August that the beach provides an ideal training area for special operations units from all branches of the military to practice over the water, on the beach and in the bay. The military sometimes drops trainees over the water using boats or helicopters and the trainees must make their way onshore. The black helicopter that crashed was a newer model that had a black box, which could shed light on what caused the crash if located.

"Forced into a head brace, bound and held up by police officers, or sitting down with their eyes rolled back in their heads - these are the harrowing faces of mental illness in the Victorian era. Diagnosed with conditions such as ‘imbecility,’ ‘simple mania,’ and ‘acute melancholia’, all of them were patients at the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, Yorkshire, in 1869. its first Superintendent Sir William Ellis, and later Superintendent Sir James Crichton-Browne, actually paved the way for ethical treatment of the mentally ill. Crichton Browne is renowned for bringing science to the asylum when he started a laboratory for anatomy, neuropathology and histology. These pictures, taken in 1869 at the West Riding Pauper Launatic Asylum near Wakefield, Yorkshire, show some of the patients interred there. While some of the treatment looks barbaric to modern eyes, in fact the centre pioneered the way for ethical treatment of the mentally ill . The photographs are part of a 5,000-strong collection of detailed documents on patients taken by Sir James Crichton-Browne, the chief neurologist at West Riding, who helped lead the way in medical treatment of mental disorders . The West Riding Asylum, based near Wakefield, was the sixth institution of its kind in the UK to take those with mental conditions out of the way of regular society to a place of relative protection. To that end, the hospital-come-boarding house was entirely self-sufficient, housing its own bakery, butchery, dairy, shop and laundry. Previously those with mental disorders were exhibited in bedlams, such as the famous one in London, imprisoned in cells, or chained to walls in workhouses. This new, relatively compassionate approach was driven by the asylum's founder, William Tuke, a Quaker who believed in the sanctity of life and of behaving kindly and morally to all of humanity. Mark Davis, author of Voices From The Asylum, a book on the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, said: 'This new, relatively compassionate approach was driven by William Tuke the founder of the York Retreat which opened in 1796 after Hannah Mills, a Quaker, died at the York asylum in 1790. 'Tuke, a Quaker believed in the sanctity of life and of behaving kindly and morally to all of humanity. At that time Dr Samuel Best who superintended York asylum regarded the mentally ill as less than human, and while in the asylum inmates were denied access to religion and God. 'Quakers, who believe there is a spark of divinity in everyone, were appalled by this. The Retreat is still famous today for having pioneered the humane treatment and moral treatment that became a model for asylums around the world.' Alongside each of the pictures are detailed notes including height, weight, religion, and eventual fate of the patient. A diagnosis is also written on some images. The patient on the left is recorded as suffering 'general paralysis', while the woman on the right has 'acute melancholia' The West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum was actually comprised of four different hospitals, this sketch shows the building at Wakefield where these pictures were taken . Mr Davis added that life inside the asylum was still austere, with residents who were able to work given jobs in the laundry, gardens or working on farms that were sometimes attached to the hospitals. Residents were often forced to pick clothes out a pile placed in the middle of a room, finding sizes that best fit them, while treatments were vary basic. One involved a spinning chair, the theory being that spinning a person around would help to cancel out the spinning in their heads. Sir Crichton-Browne also used the security of the asylum to begin his groundbreaking research into mental illness, investigating whether there was a biological cause behind the conditions he help to diagnose. He helped to take some of these portraits of patients, meticulously labelled with notes on the patient’s appearance and ailments, and three years later collaborated with Charles Darwin on his book ‘The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.’ Crichton-Browne pioneered a medical approach to the treatment of mental disorders at West Riding, banning the use of restraints unless necessary, keeping sedation to a minimum, and allowing patients to indulge in leisure activities and take up jobs as part of their healing process. He also published in-depth journals from his time at West Riding containing observations from himself and his team on mental illness, treatments with various drugs known to affect brain function such as cannabis, nicotine, alcohol, and nitrous oxide. West Riding was one of the first institutions to treat the mentally ill. Previously those with disorders would have been locked in cells, put on display in bedlams, or chained up in workhouses (left, a woman suffering from 'senile dementia', right a man with 'mania of suspicion') While West Riding started out as a poor-house for the mentally ill, it eventually became so successful and well-known that it started taking paying residents (left, a woman with 'simple mania', and right another patient with 'mono-mania of pride') The records kept at West Riding were so detailed and extensive that they are now recognised as being of huge historic and medical importance, and are protected by UNESCO. Crichton-Browne (pictured) took over at West Riding in 1866 when he was just 26 years old, and ran it for the best part of a decade. He left in 1875 to become the Lord Chancellor's Visitor in Lunacy . The collection includes over 5000 photographs of patients from the late 1860s onwards, putting a face to thousands of the patient numbers. One patient was Mary Manning, a Bradford domestic servant, who was admitted in 1880. She claimed to be the 'Queen of heaven, possessed of great wealth and had been crowned'. Others case files show patients were suffering from general health problems such as symptoms which would be recognised today as post-natal depression. Sarah Drabble of Wortley was admitted in 1832, aged 37 with 18 children. She was, rather unsurprisingly, 'feeling in a low despondent state ever since her confinement'. Other women were suffering from social problems, including Mary Ellen Yates, a Leeds housewife, who was admitted in 1887 due to insufficient food and mistreatment by her husband. Children were admitted into the hospital from as early as 1820 and until the opening of the separate Stanley Hall facility in 1901. Examples from the Stanley Hall era include Alfred Todd of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who was diagnosed of 'imbecility with epilepsy'. The remarks made on his treatment include an answer to questions regarding name and age, which he replied 'broken window' and on asking him names of surrounding objects he replies 'Alfey'. Another mother of an 11-year-old Leeds boy in 1911, said: 'I cannot manage him. He is destructive, breaks and tears everything he can get to lay his hands on. I am obliged to keep knives out of his way and all windows closed. Children in the neighbourhood are afraid of him.' Under the guidance of Crichton-Browne West Riding Asylum went from being a centre to house the poor and mentally ill to taking paying patients who were afraid of being taken elsewhere. But while the project initially set out to improve the treatment of those with disorders, overcrowding and a lack of funding eventually led to horrible conditions developing, with several patients killed during disease breakouts inside the facility. Sir Crichton-Browne's research helped pave the way of treatment for the mentally ill, including the theory that some illnesses occurred naturally, while others were due to outside factors (left, a man with 'organic dementia, and right a woman with 'constructive dementia') Two men interred at West Riding Asylum are pictured. While the patients were cut off from regular society, they were kept out of restraints as much as possible, allowed to partake in hobbies, and could get jobs at the on site bakery, butcher, or shop .","Photographs were taken at West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum by chief neurologist Sir James Crichton-Browne .

"A 'sadistic' double murderer has been granted clemency by the Indonesia President Joko Widodo, while two of the Bali Nine ringleaders remain on death row. Just weeks after Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were denied clemency, Dwi Trisna Firmansyah had his death sentence reduced to life. The 27-year-old was one of three killers involved in the brutal premeditated murder of a shop owner and his school- aged son in April 2012,News Corp reported. Scroll down for video . A 'sadistic' murderer has been granted clemency in Indonesia, while Australian convicted drug traffickers Andrew Chan (right) and Myuran Sukumaran (left) remain on death row . While the decision, which was apparently signed off by Widodo on February 13 but only reached Firmansyah this week, has been praised by human rights groups, they have also said it highlights the inequalities in the judicial system. The lawyer for Firmansyah hopes he will be out from behind bars in the next few years. The 27-year-old, along with two others, allegedly planned to rob and murder a mobile shop owner in Pekanbaru. The trio broke into the man's shop and hit him over the head with a wooden bat while he was taking part in his morning pair. When the man's son tried to come to his father's aid he was also killed. The pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals . After the murders the group stole the shop owner's car, along with a number of mobile phones and phone credit. Their appeal to the Supreme Court earlier this year failed, but Firmansyah was then shown mercy amid the Indonesian President's tirade against convicted drug smugglers. This comes after it was revealed Chan and Sukumaran could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals. It has been revealed by the Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo that the execution of the Bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row. This could delay the pair's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out. The Indonesian Governor-General has said the death row inmates will be executed 'simultaneously' Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right, will be put through an 'assimilation' process as they prepare to face the firing squad . This means Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran may have months to wait before they face the firing squad. Mr Prasetyo also claims the death row inmates will be put through an 'assimilation' process which he believes will help them mentally prepare for their death. 'They will be accompanied by religious figures until they're truly ready,' he said. The two men are currently being held in isolation cells where they are able talk to each other. Their interaction with other inmates is limited to one Nigerian who is also on death row. Prison authorities claim there's been no order to move Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran from 'Death Island' even though the appeals process may be lengthy. Although the appeals process may be lengthy there have been no orders to transfer Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan from the prison referred to as 'Death Island' President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores . The pair's lawyers will return to Jakarta court on Thursday to challenge President Widodo's decision to deny clemency to all drug offenders. Their last appeal was adjourned until March 20 as the president's representative did not have the required legal documentation. Two weeks earlier, the Administrative Court dismissed their argument that President Widodo failed to consider their rehabilitation. The claim was rejected on the grounds that the court had no authority to overturn presidential decree. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions. Ms Bishop has offered to cover the costs of life imprisonment for the condemned men, if their lives are spared . Ms Bishop is yet to receive a response. The families of the convicted drug offenders have been allowed to visit twice since their transfer to Nusakambangan island last Wednesday, with their next visit scheduled for Monday. This news comes as a prisoner art exhibition and auction featuring Mr Sukumaran's work was dramatically cancelled after Kerobokan prison authorities said they didn't want to associate with the prisoners pending execution. The Kerobokan Jail governor Sudjonggo ordered all 92 prisoner paintings to be removed before the exhibition commenced. He claims that authorities we unaware the event was advertised as a tribute to Mr Sukumaran, a former art teacher at the prison. A chilling self portrait of Mr Sukumaran that would have been displayed alongside other prisoner art at the Kuta exhibition . The exhibition featuring Mr Sukumaran's most recent work was cancelled as prison officials say they didn't want to get caught up in the politicised executions . 'It is cancelled because we do not want to be involved in any matters relating to Myuran. I have conveyed to the organisers about that and they promised that none of Myuran's paintings will be at the exhibition,' Sydjonggo said. 'It doesn't mean that we are forgetting Myuran. No. But we just don't want to be involved in the discourse about the execution which is now already politicised,' he added. The money raised by auctioning off the prisoners artwork was to be used to continue funding the art program at the Kerobokan prison as well as building a gallery intended to showcase the works of ex-prisoners who were mentored by Mr Sukumaran. Mr Sukumaran has been unable to paint since his transfer to 'Death Island' however prison authorities say Mr Sukumaran will eventually be allowed to have his art materials. Mr Sukumaran was a highly respected art teacher while he was detained in Kerobokan prison .","Condemned Bali nine duo to be executed with other death row inmates .

"Oisin Tymon (above), the producer at the centre of the Jeremy Clarkson 'fracas', fears the incident could cost him his career, sources claim . The BBC producer involved in the 'fracas' with Jeremy Clarkson is terrified he is going to lose his job, sources claimed. Oisin Tymon has been working  on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005 and was previously an assistant producer on BBC One's The One Show. But the 36-year-old has been in hiding all week after it emerged he had been punched by the presenter at a Yorkshire hotel after a day of filming on March 4. One insider close to his legal team at Slater and Gordon described Tymon as 'mortified'. 'He is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years. All he wants to do is get back to work,' they told the Sunday Mirror. 'He is mortified by the whole thing.' The comments were made after it was revealed that the producer has become the target of online trolls and death threats. One Twitter user @CurtisBetts wrote: 'If they don't bring @JeremyClarkson back I'll be throwing punches Oisin Tymon.' And @KHJRobinson added: 'If Clarkson is sacked, will Oisin Tymon be the most hated man in the UK?' Details about the incident have ranged in detail. One report claimed the 54-year-old presenter split Tymon's lip after he came back to the hotel to find only a cold meat platter was on offer for dinner. Other sources suggested the 40-minute row was not entirely about the lack of food. Lawyers for both parties will put their cases to an independent inquiry, which starts tomorrow. Tymon, 36, has been in hiding all week after it emerged he had been punched by the presenter at a Yorkshire hotel after a day of filming on March 4. Clarkson is pictured at a Champions League game on March 11 after the incident was made public . Tymon has been working on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005. Clarkson (right) is pictured with some of the crew while filming the popular show in 2011 . Clarkson started the disciplinary process himself after phoning Danny Cohen, director of television at the BBC, to apologise about the row. AA Gill, a friend of Clarkson, confirmed the presenter made the first move in the hope that it would end tension. 'He explained he had lost his rag after a difficult and tiring day,' The Sunday Times reported him saying. Cohen immediately suspended Clarkson and pulled the last three episodes of the popular show. Clarkson is being represented by law firm Olswang, which refused to comment. Paul Daniels, representing Tymon, added that his client did not wish to add a statement. The inquiry will report back to Cohen and Lord Hall, director general, who will decide on the pair's fate. It is not known how long it will take. It has also emerged that Clarkson called BBC director of television Danny Cohen (pictured) after the row  to apologise . An inquiry will be launched tomorrow - until then it is not known what the future is for Clarkson or Tymon. The presenter has changed his Twitter biography to reflect the unknown, adding 'probbably' (sic) to his description . Lord Hall refused to 'speculate' on Clarkson's future after details of the incident emerged and said the BBC's internal investigation would 'get the people who are impacted by this together'. He said: 'There is a lot of speculation, we have got to establish the facts and I intend to do that before we come to a final decision. 'That is what we are about to do.' But BBC management sources have claimed that Top Gear would survive without Clarkson as other shows – including Have I Got News For You and Strictly Come Dancing – have coped with the loss of a much-loved presenter. They added about Tymon: 'We would hope he will continue to be employed by the BBC after this matter is resolved.' Meanwhile, a petition to reinstate Clarkson has gathered more than 870,000 signatures. This evening Clarkson jokingly made reference to the pulled show by tweeting a picture of darkness with the caption 'and tonight on Top Gear'. The BBC launched an astonishing attack on Jeremy Clarkson yesterday, comparing him to sex offender Jimmy Savile and urging him to check into rehab. Blaming the now notorious 'fracas' with a Top Gear producer on 'personal issues', one of the most senior Corporation executives said Clarkson was 'self-destructing' and needed help. Most controversially, the TV chief, who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident, likened Clarkson's supporters – including the Prime Minister – to those who turned a blind eye to Savile's appalling crimes. Last night, friends of the 54-year-old presenter expressed disbelief that the BBC should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy had even begun. 'I am in total shock that someone at the BBC would attack their own talent and deliberately smear Jeremy,' said Perry McCarthy, who was Top Gear's mysterious test driver The Stig. The comments came during a wide-ranging official briefing given to The Mail on Sunday by a senior BBC figure. The executive likened 36-year-old Tymon's position to that of Savile's victims, who feared they would not be believed while he was alive. 'The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,' he said, adding that Clarkson's support from high-level politicians recalled the way Savile was once defended. 'If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile's a real talent, Maria Miller saying Savile will be Savile.' The BBC executive also said that attempts to suggest the ‘fracas’ was part of a wider battle between Clarkson and Danny Cohen, the BBC’s powerful director of television, were misleading.","Oisin Tymon is 'mortified' after row at Yorkshire hotel was made public .

M: He won’t know because he is not coming to see you or will you go in the ambulance and go to the North Pole to see him at his house? O: I don’t know if I can go to his house but I’ve got ways of talking to Father Christmas from here so I can tell him... I can send him a special message. Has anybody knocked on your door yet my darling? M: No . O: Are you still there? M: Yeah . O: Right, the policemen are outside... But they may have to make a noise to come in. M: Ok. (dog barks) Oh, that’s just my dog . Megan stayed with her mother, talked to her to keep her calm, stroked her back and fetched her a cushion and a blanket during the incident on December 15 . Police and ambulance arrived at the address just as Mr Stratton returned home and his wife was given the attention she needed. This week, officers presented Megan with the Chief Constable's Certificate of Appreciation and her mother says she could not be prouder. Mrs Stratton has suffered from seizures in the past and had told Megan what to do if she ever fell ill when nobody else was around. She said: 'Suffolk Police called me back and explained what she'd done and I was a bit stunned and once we knew we were really, really proud. Megan Stratton is  pictured receiving an award and praised for summoning emergency crews to her mother Charlotte, 32 . 'We knew I have seizures regularly so what we do is, on the emergency button on the mobile phone, we have daddy's number programmed and the ambulance, so it was quite easy for her to do.' Call handler Alan Austin added: 'You quite often get young children phone up, but none as calm and composed as Megan. 'It's not very often you get a four-year-old who you can talk with quite so easily, who can guide you while you guide her and it made life so much easier.' Temporary Chief Constable Gareth Wilson also praised the youngster and said the award went some way towards recognising her bravery. He said: 'Megan's call to police was truly exceptional to listen to - it is very rare to hear a child handle a call in such a calm manner. 'Megan gave a lot of information to Alan for a child of her age and our Chief Constable's Certificate of Appreciation goes some way toward recognising her and saying well done.'","Megan Stratton called 999 after mother collapsed at home with a seizure .

"Facebook is to begin supporting virtual reality on its newsfeed, with users able to put on a VR headset and explore a virtual location. The social network announced that users will be able to view videos filmed with multiple cameras, and move the viewpoint in order to explore a location. The innovation is being showcased at the firm's F8 developers' conference in San Francisco under the name Teleportation Station - a name that was leaked via an app notification this morning. Scroll down to see a 360 degree video . Facebook is hosting two-day developers' conference F8, where Mrk Zuckerberg revealed its VR plans . The company is demonstrating the new video format for attendees at this week's F8 conference by showing off a 24-camera-view of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. On a desktop computer, it is controlled by a mouse. 'You're going to be able to put on your Oculus headset,' Zuckerberg said, 'and view spherical videos there too.' The  videos are shot with twenty-four cameras working in parallel. 'You can move around inside the video,' Mark Zuckerberg said, 'and view it from different angles.' The company is demonstrating the new video format for attendees at this week's F8 conference by showing off a 24-camera-view of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. On a desktop computer, it is controlled by a mouse. However,  the company describes its spherical videos as a 'first step' toward even more immersive videos that we'll view through virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift, which straps over your eyes and provide the illusion of stepping inside a digital environment. 'You're going to be able to put on your Oculus headset,' Zuckerberg said, 'and view spherical videos there too.' He also announced that users will soon be able to share content from third-party apps in their Messenger - Facebook's instant messaging service. 'One of the fastest growing and most important members of our family is Messenger,' said Mr Zuckerberg. 'Facebook used to be this single blue app and it did a lot of different things, now Facebook is a family of apps,' he said. 'Moving from being a single service to a family of apps is the biggest shift we've made in our strategy in helping connect people.' The Messenger Platform was also launched, allowing developers to build new services into the app, which is used by 600 million users each month. Mr Zuckerberg said it would give users 'more tools for expression'. The new Platform will give users the chance to communicate directly with businesses, for example to change an order as well as track its delivery. The move will allow users to see 360 degree videos using the Oculus Rift headset (pictured) Facebook's David Marcus, vice president of messaging products, took to the stage to confirm that apps like ESPN have already built apps that will now be supported in Messenger. Over 40 apps will be launched in the coming days, he confirmed. The initial kit for developers to build their software into Messenger will be available from today, though no general release date has yet been confirmed. Mr Marcus also spoke of Facebook's desire to revolutionise online shopping by allowing users to receive real-time shopping updates via Messenger. This will start a message thread with the brand a user has shopped with, so they can track and alter an order via an instant message conversation. Users can then send a thumbs-up to confirm an order. It will begin rolling out in the 'next few weeks', according to Mr Marcus. 'It's time for us to reinvent how people and business communicate,' he said. Ilya Sukhar, from the social media site's Parse department, the area of Facebook made for developers, also announced that the social network will begin supporting software development kits (SDKs) for the 'internet of things'. This is the idea that all a person's smart devices can be connected together, enabling developers to create apps for Facebook that can control part of the home. Facebook is trying to mould its Messenger app into a more versatile communications channel as smartphones create new ways for people to connect with friends and businesses beyond the walls of the company's ubiquitous social network. To pull it off, Facebook is opening Messenger so outside programmers can build features tailored for the service. Messenger will also be adding the ability to display store receipts and shipping information to help consumers keep track of their interactions with merchants and other businesses. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg touted the Messenger expansion Wednesday during his opening speech at a two-day conference for developers in San Francisco. The push to plant more features in Messenger underscores the growing importance of apps that enable more intimate and direct conversations than social networks. The example of receiving a notification when a garage door is opened was demonstrated on-stage. The F8 developers' conference, which is being attended by more than 3,000 Facebook app developers, is the social network's only major live show of the year. The company, which has more than 1.3 billion monthly users, also unveiled a range of new tools for advertisers, including new analytics tools to monitor ad campaigns. 'All of you are the ones building the services that are unleashing this new wave of expression,' said Mr Zuckerberg, as he returned to the stage. 'It's really our honour to serve you and to be on this journey together. Let's go connect the world,' he said.","Facebook recently bought virtual reality headset make Oculus .

"David Duckenfield, 70, accepted he 'froze' during the 1989 football disaster before he ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion . The police chief in charge during the Hillsborough disaster has admitted that his failure to close a tunnel was the 'direct cause' of the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans. David Duckenfield, 70, accepted he 'froze' during the 1989 football disaster before he ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion outside the Leppings Lane turnstile. The retired officer has already made a series of admissions about 'mistakes' he made, confessed that he lied in the aftermath and apologised 'unreservedly' to fans' families. Mr Duckenfield was responding to questions from Paul Greaney QC, representing the Police Federation, during his sixth day of evidence at the new Hillsborough inquests in Warrington, Cheshire. Mr Greaney reminded Mr Duckenfield of his earlier evidence to Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquest, about his state of mind after the opening of Gate C when he told her: 'It was a momentous decision and your decision is such that you do not think of the next step. My mind for a moment went blank.' Asked again if he had 'froze', Mr Duckenfield said: 'It appears to be a distinct possibility.' Mr Greaney said: 'You know what was in your mind and I will ask just one last time. Will you accept that in fact you froze?' 'Yes sir,' said Mr Duckenfield. Mr Greaney went on: 'Do you agree with the following, that people died in a crush in the central pens?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'That if they had not been permitted to flow down the tunnel into those central pens that would not have occurred?' The witness repeated: 'Yes sir.' The barrister continued: 'That closing the tunnel would have prevented that and therefore would have prevented the tragedy.' Mr Duckenfield said again: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney went on: 'That failure was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 persons in the Hillsborough tragedy.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes sir.' Up to 2,000 fans entered Gate C, with many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them which Mr Duckenfield had not ordered to be closed and then on to the already full central pens on the terrace which led to the fatal crushing. He claimed he was unaware of the geography of Sheffield Wednesday's ground, this being his first match in charge. Mr Greaney said: 'Do you agree that never mind a competent match commander it might only take a child of average intelligence to realise what the consequences of your actions might be?' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I did not think of it on the day, sir, because of the pressure I was under.' The inquests have heard that Mr Duckenfield told the 1989 Taylor Inquiry into the disaster that he had made the right decisions on the day but he now accepted that he had made errors - some of which were 'grave'. The inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend Hillsborough was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back-up from dog-handlers . Around 2,000 fans poured in through Gate C (pictured), many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them, which had not been closed off by police . He has told the jury that his serious failings were due to his lack of experience and that others also played their part in the cause of the deaths. Mr Duckenfield agreed with Mr Greaney that it was 'totally unacceptable' that a match commander 'did not have a grip on the geography of that ground sufficient to enable you to understand the consequences of your decision making'. He also accepted that when giving evidence to Lord Justice Taylor it appeared that he was aware that the congested Leppings Lane turnstiles did lead to the central tunnel. Mr Duckenfield said he did not want to go into detail about his 'personal circumstances' - he has previously said he suffered post-traumatic stress - but he may have been 'confused' when giving evidence in 1989. He said he had expected police officers on the perimeter track of the ground and those in the West Stand overlooking the Leppings Lane terrace pens to have kept an eye on monitoring the filling of them. But he accepted they had no received formal instructions to do so. John Beggs QC, representing Mr Duckenfield, outlined what he said were the three failures of his client that would exercise the jury. Some 96 Liverpool fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded Leppings Lane terrace . Firstly, to prevent congestion building up to dangerous levels at the Leppings Lane turnstiles. Secondly, the failure to delay the kick-off at any appropriate time and thirdly the 'most serious failure' was that of failing to ensure the closing of the tunnel leading to the central pens. Mr Beggs went on: 'You accept you could have done more in the aftermath when it became obvious that there was a disaster unfolding.' 'Yes sir,' said Mr Duckenfield. Mr Beggs continued: 'But you do not accept that officers in front of the pens needed any specific direction in relation to the task of getting injured supporters out of the pens.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'That is correct, sir.' Mr Beggs said: 'I think the reason in your view is they would have exercised their natural wish to save life and limb?' 'Yes,' replied the witness. Mr Duckenfield agreed with Mr Beggs that it was his belief he had declared a major incident but accepted there was no record of such a direction. He also accepted that an experienced match commander 'probably would not have made at least some or perhaps any of those mistakes'. Mr Duckenfield agreed that he 'buried his head in the sand' following the tragedy. At the Taylor Inquiry weeks after the disaster he was asked about his reaction when he was told shortly before the hearing that he probably needed separate legal representation from South Yorkshire Police. A young Liverpool fan is carried away from the danger as supporters are forced on to the Hillsborough pitch . He told the jury: 'I felt destroyed. I was quite shocked and extremely disappointed. 'I was of the view that that I was being represented by Mr Woodward (then Queen's Counsel for South Yorkshire Police) and probably I was a little naive. In all honesty it gave me no confidence whatsoever to think that I was walking into Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry somewhat naked, shall I say.' Mr Duckenfield agreed with his barrister that it was only in recent times that he had been able to come to terms with his mistakes and make the admissions he made to the jury last week. Asked whether he had found it easy to admit his 'professional failings which led to the deaths of 96 innocent men, women and children', Mr Duckenfield said: 'It has been the most difficult period of my life.' The jury heard he had not revealed his mistakes to officers from Operation Resolve - the ongoing criminal investigation into the disaster - when he was interviewed last March under criminal caution in relation to 'serious criminal offences'. Mr Beggs asked: 'Rightly or wrongly, did you feel that was a good time to be making the admissions and the apologies that you have made over the last week?' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I didn't think it was the right time, sir.' He told his barrister that in the lead up to the Taylor Inquiry no senior officer had told him he should accept at least some responsibility for the deaths, and that he had even gone on to command two matches at Hillsborough after the disaster. The jury was told by Mr Duckenfield that South Yorkshire Police was not accepting any responsible for the disaster at the time the Taylor Inquiry began. Mr Beggs said: 'To what extent did you Mr Duckenfield, as it were, go along with that corporate line from on high?' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'Sir, I was an employee of South Yorkshire Police.' Mr Beggs told the inquests that his client did in fact apologise at Taylor for giving misleading remarks about the opening of the gates and that fans were to blame for causing disorder. Supporters pay their respects to the deceased at the Anfield gates in Liverpool after the disaster in 1989 . The barrister reminded the jury that Mr Duckenfield had told the Taylor inquiry: 'My deepest sympathy goes out to them. I cannot say enough on that matter.' Mr Beggs asked his client: 'Did that reflect that you were unable to then properly put into words how you were feeling?' 'Yes sir,' said Mr Duckenfield. Mr Beggs continued: 'You understand why the delay in providing a more gracious and more full apology has caused to many both offence and distress?' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I fully understand, sir.' He said he had been in a state of denial and had been drinking heavily ahead of Taylor's inquiry . Following Lord Justice Taylor's interim findings on the tragedy in early August, Mr Duckenfield was suspended from duty on August 4, 1989. He was later medically retired on November 10, 1991. The witness will return to give evidence tomorrow. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","David Duckenfield, 70, was in charge of stadium on day of 1989 disaster .

"An investor and a California winery owner are dead after an apparent murder-suicide in a bucolic Napa Valley vineyard following a business deal gone awry. Napa County vintner Robert Dahl allegedly shot dead Emad Tawfilis in a vineyard overlooking Highway 29, the main route through the region, Monday afternoon as a result of a long-standing dispute over money. Dahl then fled into the wooded hills between Napa and Sonoma valleys, with sheriff's deputies in hot pursuit, and shot himself. Scroll down for video . Murder in a vineyard: Napa Valley winery owner Robert Dahl (pictured) allegedly killed an investor who had sued him for fraud before turning the gun on himself . Shady dealings: Dahl, the owner of Santa Rosa Winery, had been accused of swindling $1.2million in loans . Crime scene: Dahl and his investor Emad Tawfilis had a meeting Monday morning, and less than 30 minutes later Tawfilis called 911 saying he had been shot in a vineyard overlooking Highway 29 . Tawfilis collapsed to the ground at this intersection and was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the head. This image shows his body being removed by officials . Kousha Berokim, a Los Angeles attorney who represented Dahl, told Santa Rosa Press Democrat his client and Tawfilis had met Monday morning at Dahl's winery to discuss a loan dispute. He says Tawfilis was suing his client, claiming Dahl defrauded him out of $1.2million. Beroukim, who took part in a 11am meeting between Dahl and Tawfilis over a conference call, said both parties agreed to work out their differences, and that neither one sounded upset or hostile. Just before noon Monday, Tawfilis made a frantic 911 call from Santa Rosa Winery telling the dispatcher that he had been shot, and that 'someone was coming after him.' Sheriff's deputies raced to the vineyard and arrived just in time to witness two men standing in the middle of the property, one of them holding a gun. The armed suspect was then spotted running to a parked SUV and peeling off in the direction of Sonoma County. Frantic search: Dahl got into his SUV and led sheriff's deputies on a 10-mile chase . Final destination: Dahl's vehicle crashed through a fence and came to rest in the woods. His body was later inside by a SWAT team . A member of Napa law enforcement places markers in a vineyard at a winery, while investigating a crime scene, south of Yountville . One of the responding deputies went in pursuit of the SUV while another rushed to the remaining man, later identified as Emad Tawfilis, who had collapsed to the ground with a gunshot wound to the head. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Meanwhile, multiple sheriff's vehicles followed Dahl's SUV, which was eventually found 10 miles away trapped in some bushes. Believing that Dahl fled the vehicle on foot, officers set up a perimeter and called in a helicopter to help search for the suspect from the air. Nearby residents were urged to stay indoors and call 911 if they noticed something suspicious. It was not until a SWAT team arrived on the scene that Dahl’s vehicle was opened. Inside, they discovered the man’s lifeless body. In vino veritas: A native of Minnesota, Robert Dahl moved to Northern California about five years ago and started several wine-related ventures . Fizzled out: Dahl (center) tried his hand at making beer, but his brewery quickly failed .

"Tory spending cuts will take Britain back to the days when children left school at 14, Ed Miliband claimed today as he launched Labour's general election pledge card. The Labour leader used a speech in Birmingham to warn the election was a choice between a party working for the 'good of some or the good of all'. But he also sought to strike a more optimistic tone, claiming that when working people succeed, 'nothing can stop us as a country'. Labour leader Ed Miliband used a speech in Birmingham to warn the election was a choice between a party working for the 'good of some or the good of all' He unveiled Labour's election pledge card setting out five priorities to voters ahead of polling day on May 7 . Labour has seized on figures which show that under the Tory plan to eradicate the deficit, by 2020 public spending as a share of national income will fall to around 35 per cent, the same level seen in the 1930s. The government insists that according to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, by 2019-20, day-to-day spending would only be at its lowest level since 2002-03 in real terms. Mr Miliband was expected to say: 'The Tories will carry on putting in place their vision of how our country succeeds by stripping public services to the very bone so they hit their target of spending back to levels not seen since the 1930s, before there was a NHS and children left school at 14. 'Be in no doubt what that means: education cut, the NHS undermined, social care devastated, crumbling infrastructure, lower living standards. This is not the future that our great country deserves. This is not the future the great people of our country deserve. Britain can do better than this.' Mr Miliband unveiled Labour's election pledge card, in an echo of the five-point card used by Tony Blair before the 1997 election. Deputy leader Harriet Harman, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves listen to the speech at the ICC in Birmingham . He argued that Britain's economic prosperity rests on the success of the many. He said: 'Today we set out how we can replace a failed, tired, government for the few with a government that is truly for all the people of Britain. Today I tell you how we will change the way our country is run when I am Prime Minister. 'It is based on a different idea of how we succeed, a different idea of how we live together, a different idea of the kind of country we can become - because the choice at this election is not simply between parties and leaders, but between different visions of our country. Labour's election pledge card sets out five promises to voters: . 'The choice is between the pessimists or the optimists, fear or hope, the few or the many, the good of some or the good of all. 'Today I urge the British people to choose optimism, to choose a country for the many, to choose the good of all, to choose hope - and to recognise that when working people succeed, nothing can stop us as a country.' The pledges include repairing the economy, raising living standards, investment in the NHS, some controls on immigration and more help for young people. Mr Miliband said: 'I do not simply say that we should judge our nation's success by the success of working people. I say that only by working people succeeding can we succeed as a country. And it is an idea embodied in our pledges, written through each like a stick of rock,' he will add. But Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'The real choice at this election is between the stability and strong leadership of David Cameron and the Conservatives working to a long-term economic plan, securing a better future for Britain. 'Or Ed Miliband carried into Downing Street in the pocket of Alex Salmond and the SNP - meaning more borrowing, more debt, higher taxes and weaker defences. 'Competence or chaos. That's the choice on 7th May.'","Labour leader says Britain only succeeds when working families succeed .

"Police have been forced to play Prince Charming after numerous residents complained that their shoes had gone missing from their front gardens. However, they were shocked when they found over 1000 pairs of runners and slippers stashed away in a 57-year-old man's Melbourne unit. The Kilsyth thief had been caught on CCTV scouring the area where he lived for the past three months but when he invited police into his home they had no idea as to the extent of his crazy shoe robbing spree. Scroll down for video . Police have been forced to play Prince Charming after numerous residents complained that their shoes had gone missing from their front gardens . The man has stashed the shoes all over his unit, filling up cupboards with the footwear and forming massive piles in corners of his house. In the loungeroom, he hid about 50 pairs of shoes under the table and couch and hid hundreds more in the kitchen and bathroom. Police found about 600 pairs of shoes piled high under his bed and he stacked them so high that the windows in the bedroom could not be opened. However, they were shocked when they found over 1000 pairs of runners and slippers stashed away in a 57-year-old man's Melbourne unit . Police have been trying to sort through 40 bags of shoes they collected from the man's house. The shoes range from women's to men's and even children's shoes. A pair of yellow fluffy Tweety bird slippers stood out, as did a pair of expensive looking runners and some dolphin slippers. While the man has an obvious fascination with shoes, police believe he does not have mental issues. The Kilsyth thief had been caught on CCTV scouring the area where he lived for the past three months but when he invited police into his home they had no idea as to the extent of his crazy shoe robbing spree . The man has stashed the shoes all over his unit, filling up cupboards with the footwear and forming massive piles in corners of his house . Although there were over 1000 pairs of shoes, the man was reportedly only ever seen wearing one pair of shoes. His only explanation to police was that 'he just liked shoes'. 'They were in his kitchen cupboards, under his sinks, they were in the cupboards above the sink,' Leading Senior Constable Baker told The Age. In the loungeroom, he hid about 50 pairs of shoes under the table and couch and hid hundreds more in the kitchen and bathroom . Police found about 600 pairs of shoes piled high under his bed and he stacked them so high that the windows in the bedroom could not be opened . 'It really looks like he's just an old man, who is harmless. He's never been in trouble with the police before and he's just got a fascination with shoes.' 'This is just purely someone who likes shoes,' he said. While police are investigating the incident, they have taken a light-hearted approach to the investigation and are holding an open day at the station so the public can reclaim their shoes. 'If you have had shoes stolen in the Kilsyth and Mooroolbark area you are invited to attend the Mooroolbark Police station on Sunday 29 March between 11am-4pm to see if the shoe fits you,' they said. The shoes ranged from women's to men's and even children's shoes. A pair of yellow fluffy Tweety bird slippers stood out, as did a pair of expensive looking runners and some dolphin slippers .

"If you are struggling to get any mobile phone reception tonight, it may be the fault of the peregrine falcon. Vodafone said three pairs of the world's fastest bird were spotted nesting in and around masts across London and could be slowing down networks. Engineers involved in a £200million 4G upgrading project in the capital found nests on a church, hospital and office block in the last few days. Vodafone engineers discovered the bird of prey nesting in and around masts across London (stock image) Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 it is illegal to disturb the birds while they are nesting . Peregrine falcons became almost extinct in the 1960s after a population crash caused by pesticides. They have been a protected species since 1981. Legislation controlling use of pesticides meant their numbers slowly recovered. Its long, pointed wings and short tail allow it to be fast and agile while flying for prey. They eat medium sized birds, small ducks and pigeons. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds estimates there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. They nest in areas they consider resemble a cliff-face, such as tower blocks and church towers. Phone masts are a popular nesting site for the bird of prey and the company will be unable to remove the nests until the chicks are hatched and leave, which could take up to three months. It is a criminal offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 to disturb the birds while they are nesting. If prosecuted, offenders face six months’ imprisonment and a fine of up to £5,000. Vodafone says this will cause delays to service upgrades and and customers could face disruption to the current network as they reroute mobile traffic from the affected sites to other masts. Simon Gordon, of Vodafone, told MailOnline: 'There are three nests in London. They are in Shadwell, Lewisham and Hammersmith and there is a pair in a small place in Hampshire. 'We have to call in the experts to work out exactly where the nest is and we can then upgrade the network or leave them alone for two to three months.' He added: 'We apologise to any customers who experience a dip in service, but we have to respect the environment and the law. 'This is the first time to my knowledge we've had this in London, so for us it's unprecedented. They can sometimes nest on the mast itself which is like a big metal climbing frame or use the box underneath where the computer stuff sits. There are believed to be around 30 nesting pairs in Greater London, and six more birds have moved in to nest in Hammersmith, Shadwell and Lewisham (stock image) Peregrine falcons - which can reach speeds of 240mph - have enjoyed a revival in the UK in the past few decades after their existence was threatened by pesticides in the 1960s. Stuart Harrington, from the London Peregrine Partnership, told the Evening Standard: 'There are more peregrine falcons in London than there are in the more picturesque areas up north. 'London probably has the highest density of peregrine falcons in the UK, with many flying up from the south coast and settling here.'","Peregrine falcon spotted nesting in and around masts across London .

Please, no more.' The song Cry No More was originally recorded by Orthodox Jewish singer Yaakov Shwekey. It was released in 2012 and became a major hit within the Jewish community. The song details the struggle for peace in the Middle East and ends with the hope in the coming of Redemption. Among the lyrics are the words: 'Many tears have fallen, many years we’re calling, please no more. 'Many broken-hearted, friends lost and departed, please no more. 'Now the time has come, everyone must stand together, and be strong forever more.' In the recording the older children can be heard singing at the top of their voices, with the younger siblings also eager to join in. According to the New York Post, the family are yet to commit the recording  to a CD because it was made so soon before the fire. Today Mr Sassoon is expected to return to New York following the children's funerals. On Sunday, the devastated father and hundreds of mourners attended a memorial for the children at Shomrei Hadas Chapel in Borough Park before a procession of hearses led their coffins to New York's JFK airport where they were boarded onto a flight bound for Israel. His wife Gayle and daughter Tzipora were the only two in his family to survive the blaze, after jumping from the second floor. They both remain in hospital. Mr Sassoon was away from the home at a religious retreat in Manhattan at the time of the fire. He said: 'My wife gave her soul to our children every day, until their last day. 'They were such innocent children. I didn't know there could be such tears. Seven roses, so beautiful and pure.' A fire ripped through the Sassoon family home in Brooklyn in the early hours of Saturday morning . The blaze was sparked by a malfunctioning hot plate left on to keep food warm during the Sabbath . The New York Fire Department said it was the most devastating blaze seen by the city in seven years and confirmed a smoke detector was found in the basement but that there were none others throughout the home. Firefighters received a call at 12.23am about the blaze at a single-family home in Midwood, a section of Brooklyn known for its low crime and large Orthodox Jewish population. More than 100 firefighters responded and brought the blaze under control at around 1.30am. Investigators said the fire started in the kitchen, when a hot plate that was left on caught fire. The hot plate was left on for the Sabbath, which lasts from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. The Sassoons' hot plate apparently malfunctioned, setting off flames that tore up the stairs, trapping the children in their second-floor bedrooms as they slept, investigators added.","Recording reportedly features the children singing the song 'Cry No More'

He is pictured with business partner Stefano Gabbana (left) 'And shame on you for wagging your judgmental little fingers at IVF – a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children. 'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana.' His outburst prompted a mass social media campaign, as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand. Boycott: Sir Elton John (pictured with his husband David Furnish and their children), spoke out against Dolce and Gabbana and claimed that he will never wear any of their clothes ever again after their comments . Equality campaigners and celebrities also weighed in on the dispute - gay rights activist Peter Tatchell has organised a protest outside D&G's London store on Thurday to show the public's opposition to the inflammatory comments. Victoria Beckham, a former Dolce and Gabbana ambassador who is close friends with Sir Elton, offered her support with the message: 'Sending love to Elton David Zachary Elijah & all the beautiful IVF babies x vb.' OMD&G! Elton was seen carrying a Dolce & Gabbana bag only days after launching a feud against the brand . But the designers hit back - Stefano Gabbana told an Italian newspaper: 'It's useless, this is just an authoritarian way of seeing things: if you agree with me, good, otherwise I'll attack. And I wrote to him, in the comments on Instagram: fascist.' Things took a twist when Elton was seen carrying a D&G-branded bag only 24 hours after he entered into a high-profile row with the designers over their criticism of fertility treatments. Caught red handed: The star clearly didn't seem too oposed to the fashion house even though he encouraged others to boycott . Photographers said Sir Elton was seen carrying the Dolce & Gabbana bag on March 16, after being dropped off in his chauffeur-driven SUV. A spokesman for the singer confirmed: ‘Yes he was carrying the bag but he hadn’t been shopping. And it should not detract from their original message or the boycott.’ Elton's comments on-stage in Las Vegas came after Dolce insisted his views were private, personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional Sicilian family. In an interview with CNN, Dolce insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure, and said: 'I believe in the traditional family. 'It is impossible to change my culture for something different. It's me...I respect all the world, all the culture.' Dolce said he would not be not boycotting the artist and added: 'I love the music of Elton John.' He said he believed they could end the dispute and added: 'Every people resolve everything by talk...we start to talk, the problem is resolved. 'Every people [has] freedom for choosing what they want. This for me is democracy. I respect you because you choose what you want. 'I respect me because I choose what I want. This just my point of private view.' Interview: Dolce made his inflammatory remarks in an interview with Italian magazine Panorama earlier this month . Furious: Sir Elton posted a photo of design duo Dolce & Gabbana on his Instagram page and responded to their comments in a strongly-worded attack .","Domenico Dolce called children born via IVF 'synthetic'

"'Divisive': Patients are left in corridors outside wards they should be in while waiting for a free bed . Hospitals are being encouraged to park seriously ill patients on trolleys in corridors to ease the A&E crisis. Doctors say the controversial practice of ‘boarding’ – which amounts to letting wards overflow – is already being used at a number of under-pressure hospitals in England. It involves putting patients on trolleys outside the wards they should be in while they wait for a free bed instead of keeping them in A&E. Rather than criticising the measure, desperate A&E doctors say boarding should be used more widely – even though they concede it is ‘potentially toxic’. They argue it is necessary to free up space in overcrowded casualty units. As a result, doctors at the influential Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) have now given boarding their backing. But critics question its safety, amid fears that giving the green light to boarding could serve to legitimise overflowing NHS wards. Dr Adrian Boyle, an A&E consultant at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge and a prominent RCEM member, argued it was better to have patients waiting on corridor trolleys, after they had been seen and assessed, than languishing outside A&E in queuing ambulances. Between mid-December and mid-January, there were 11,203 occasions across England – more than 350 a day – in which ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because A&Es were full. Casualties are often crammed because patients cannot be shifted elsewhere in the hospital due to lack of beds – a situation called ‘exit block’. Studies show that when A&Es are crowded, patients fare worse and death rates can rise. Dr Boyle said: ‘Boarding spreads the risk across the whole hospital, rather than concentrating and multiplying it in the emergency department.’ He admitted it was ‘potentially toxic and divisive’ but said an ‘exceptional response’ was needed to ‘exceptional circumstances’. Dr Boyle said that ‘a handful’ of hospitals now use boarding during busy periods, but he would not name them. A spokesman for Addenbrooke’s said they did not use the practice. Dr Boyle was speaking at a conference organised by the RCEM, which is advocating greater use of boarding. With hospitals – and A&Es in particular – getting busier every year, he said action had to be taken to better manage the rising flow of patients. ‘If we get a trend like this going on into next winter, it’s going to be like Armageddon,’ he warned. On 11,203 occasions across England – more than 350 a day – ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because A&Es were full . Emergency doctors also see boarding as a way of making their hospital colleagues realise the problems they are facing. Dr Katherine Henderson, an A&E consultant at St Thomas’s Hospital in London, said: ‘It is not acceptable to have people waiting in the emergency department, out of sight of the rest of the hospital.’ But many medics have serious reservations. Dr Chris Whale, clinical director of Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said there was ‘pretty much no evidence’ that boarding was safe in NHS hospitals. He said: ‘For a Royal college to advocate this is fairly hazardous, without the evidence base to support it.’ The Mail on Sunday has been campaigning for almost three years to stop the closure of A&E units.","Doctors at Royal College of Emergency Medicine have backed boarding .

"If you've ever fancied owning a slice of some of the most beautiful countryside England has to offer, then now’s your chance. A stunning mountain lake, a stretch of rocky shoreline and several sites of ancient woodland, home to red deer and red squirrels, are among eight sites being sold by the Lake District National Park Authority. But the sale has provoked anger among locals who say it would have Lakeland poet William Wordsworth ‘turning in his grave’. The possible sale of beautiful countryside in the Lake District such as Blea Brows, an area of shoreline alongside Coniston Water on the market for £90,000, has angered locals . Stickle Tarn, a glacial lake popular with swimmers in Great Langdale, is up for sale with a guide price of £20,000 to £30,000 . They are angry that they were not consulted about the decision to sell the picturesque sites – worth a total of up to £665,000 – and at the ‘sheer speed’ of the sale, which is being rushed through in five weeks. Perhaps the most impressive site is Stickle Tarn, a ‘majestic’ 24-acre glacial lake in Great Langdale, high above Coniston Water and Windermere, which is popular with wild swimmers. It is up for sale with a guide price of £20,000 to £30,000. Forty-one acres of woodland at Waterside Knott, near Newby Bridge, is being sold with a guide price of £130,000. The site has a 215-year-old Grade II listed viewing tower and is home to red squirrels, door mice, and roe and red deer. Blea Brows, a stretch of shoreline along Coniston Water, is for sale with a guide price of £70,000 to £90,000. The ten-acre site has stunning views, a small beach and oak, birch and holly woodland. The Lake District National Park Authority, the Government-funded body responsible for managing the park, insists strict covenants on the land ensure the sites will be protected for the public and rights of way will not be affected. But some locals fear access could be restricted, woodland and historic dry stone walls may not be properly managed and that wealthy buyers may apply for planning permission to build on the land. Majestic: Waterside Knott, a woodland home to red squirrels, is being sold with a guide price of £130,000 . Heidi Halliday, a district councillor for Ambleside and Grasmere, said: ‘Wordsworth would be turning in his grave if he knew what was happening. Everyone is incredibly upset, especially because it has been handled so badly, with no consultation. Stickle Tarn is the only tarn left under the park authority’s ownership. You would think they would want to keep hold of it, not sell it to the highest bidder.’ Last week the House of Lords stepped in to urge the Government to halt the sale. All bids are due in by Thursday but local groups hoping to raise the cash for a community bid say they had no chance to secure enough money in five weeks. The park authority says it has lost £1.56million of Government funding over the past five years and has no option but to sell. It says it has a duty to get value for money for the taxpayer and that a public body need not own the land to be a good custodian of it. Chief executive Richard Leafe described the decision to sell the land as ‘good management’ in ‘the existing financial climate’.","Lake District National Park Authority puts eight stunning sites up for sale .

"Firefighters racing to the scene of an early-morning blaze in a Colorado neighborhood arrived to find the words 'my wife's a cheater' scrawled on the outside of the home. The phrase was sprayed twice across the front of the house in Nelson Street, Arvada when firefighters responded to reports of an explosion at 1.30am on Tuesday. They also found debris in the street, including patio furniture, fire officials said. 7News reported that a name was also painted on the side of the house but it is not clear if he is connected to the fire. Scroll down for video . Accusation: Firefighters in Arvada, Colorado found the words 'My wife is a cheater' scrawled on a side of a home where they responded to a blaze on Tuesday morning . A few hours later, police said they had arrested a man on suspicion of arson in connection with the fire. They said they would release his identity on Tuesday afternoon. Neighbors told KDVR that a couple with three young children live at the home. The Arvada Fire Protection District said everyone in the home had been accounted for and there were no reports of injuries. After multiple calls from neighbors, the district responded to the home early on Tuesday and found it engulfed in flames. 'Upon their arrival, they were faced with a lot of fire that was coming from the front of the house as well as the back of the house,' spokesperson Deputy Fire Marshall Deanna Harrington told the Denver Post. Blaze: They responded to the scene of the fire at 1.30am on Tuesday after multiple calls from neighbors . Blaze: Firefighters were able to put out the flames but the home is significantly damaged by the fire . Destroyed: Later on Tuesday morning, firefighters covered the graffiti outside the house with blue tarps . Crews are unable to enter the home because the floor has been weakened by the 'very significant' damage, she said. After the flames were brought under control, officials covered up the scrawled words with blue tarps. No nearby homes were damaged by the fire. The cause of the fire has not been released and it remains under investigation, the district said. Neighbors expressed their shock over the incident. 'It's a younger family,' Fred Holman told KDVR. 'They've lived here about five years, maybe a little longer. They're very nice people, very good neighbors.

"Battle-weary Ukrainian soldiers have converted a school into a military barracks where they are sent to catch up on their R&R before being shipped back to the front line. Poignant new pictures show soldiers of the Azov Battalion dressed in full military gear as they play basketball in the school gym, climb the playground and sleep on classroom couches.

A dog is patted by one of the soldiers who was sent to the school for a break from front line fighting . It comes as sporadic reports of deaths and violence continue to emerge from the war zone despite a recently-agreed ceasefire deal. At least one Ukrainian serviceman has been killed and three wounded as a result of fighting in separatist eastern territories in the past 24 hours, the military has confirmed. However, attacks have fallen significantly in the past two weeks, but accusations of continued violence on both sides show the fragility of the peace accord agreed in Minsk last month. The deal called for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line, a promise adhered to in parts. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said: 'There is increased activity of sniper groups. The serviceman who was killed died at the hands of a sniper.' He added that while the Minsk agreements were broadly observed along the front lines, and the intensity of provocative attacks had dropped significantly, rebels continued to fire on government positions. Kiev accuses the separatists of using the ceasefire to regroup their forces and rearm for a further offensive, a charge the rebels deny, saying they have withdrawn heavy artillery in accordance with the Minsk peace deal.

'Illegal armed groups are actively involved in combat training, gathering resources and rebuilding technical readiness,' Lysenko said, adding that rebels had been tracked amassing combat equipment around their stronghold of Donetsk. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the pull-back of weapons, has said it cannot fully confirm withdrawal on both sides as it has not been given access to all the locations where some weapons have been moved. However, Germany's foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier claims violence has reduced significantly since the ceasefire deal was agreed. He said: 'A clear beginning was made. There's a significant reduction of violence after hardships at the beginning. Today, we don't have hundreds of breaches of the ceasefire, there are not many question marks regarding it.'

"Manuela Rodriguez attempted to take her own life using the power saw after allegedly murdering her granddaughter, Rose Herrera . A Chicago woman has been charged in the killing of her 7-month-old granddaughter, who had her throat cut with a power saw after being suffocated with a sock and beaten to death. Police have said the baby girl, Rose Herrera, was killed Monday, apparently because she would not stop crying. The Cook County State's Attorney's Office said Tuesday that the baby's 52-year-old grandmother, Manuela Rodriguez, was charged with first-degree murder in baby Rose's death. An autopsy concluded that the baby was already dead when her throat was slashed. It also found that not only was the girl struck in the head with an object, but that she also likely suffocated on a sock that was ‘placed in her mouth,’ according to a county medical examiner's log that includes the infant's death. Rodriguez, who police say attempted to take her own life after the attack, was taken to a hospital for treatment for injuries that were not considered life threatening. The State's Attorney's Office said Rodriguez is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. Police were called at around 9.40am to a multi-family home in the 2800 block of South Avers Avenue in the Little Village section of Chicago, where they discovered the lifeless body of the infant with 'visible trauma.' The child was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators said before the suspect took a circular saw to the child's body, she tried to quiet her down by stuffing a sock down her throat. Following the  killing, Manuela Rodriguez reportedly attempted to take her own life. She was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in a stable condition. Residents of the quiet street in the predominantly Hispanic Little Village neighborhood where Rose was killed said the Rodriguez had some health problems but was always pleasant. Officers found the child, identified by family members as Rosie, after being called Monday morning to a building on the city's West Side (pictured) State child welfare officials said they had no record of ever being called to the brick home. Neighbors said the woman and her family were always polite and did not cause trouble. ‘She would help everybody and if you needed a glass of milk or something she would give it to you,’ said Maria Gentil, who has known Rodriguez for several years and said she was a doting grandmother. ‘When my mother died, she went up and down the street asking for money for her funeral.’ Ben Llamas works with the child's father and drove him to the scene. Mr Llamas told the Chicago Tribune the father was upset but did not talk about what happened. His friend had moved in to that house about a year ago with a woman, Llamas said. The couple had a young child. ‘At first, he was reluctant, but when the baby came, he fell in love,’ Llamas said. ‘He shows us pictures of that baby every day.’ Neighbors said several people live in the home where the baby was found. ‘They were really good people,’ Francisco Arreola told the Chicago Tribune in Spanish. ‘I would always see them and they were very happy. I never heard them fight or anything.’ Tragedy: Police say the child's killer tried to stuff something down the child's throat to make her stop crying before using the saw .","The baby, identified as Rose Herrera, was found by police with her throat cut inside Chicago home .

"A former Pennsylvania cop who retired after 25 years service to start an ammunition manufacturing and wholesale business has now developed vending machines that dispense 'pretty much everything' when it comes to bullets. But while Sam Piccini, of Rochester, says that gun clubs from all over are 'chomping at the bit' for their pay-as-you-go dispensaries, complaints about the machines and their safety seem just as widespread. Piccini has installed two at his local gun club, the Beaver Valley Rifle and Pistol Club, which, like many, refuses to sell 'non-jacketed' rounds of ammunition, making the machines popular among members. Controversial: An ammunition salesman and former cop has installed two vending machines that dispense ammunition at his local gun club in Rochester, Pennsylvania . 'It's not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition': Former cop Sam Piccini says the machines are perfectly legal and that he created them for the convenience of gun club members only . The machines are kept behind locked doors that require a digital key fob - which all members have -to open. The swipe cards grant 24-hour access to the club's grounds shooting ranges, where the ammunition vending machine is located. All members have to be over 18 to get a swipe card. In Pennsylvania, people ages 18 and over can buy long gun ammunition, and people over 21 can buy bullets for handguns. Piccini has defended himself against cries that the devices will allow minors easy access to ammo. 'It's not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition,' he told Fox News. The machines sell nearly every caliber of bullet from .22 to .45. 'The machine sells pretty much everything,' said Piccinini, . 'From .22 long rifle to .45 Long Colt and every standard caliber in between except .32 and .25 automatic. 'It's got 380, 9, 38, 40, 45, .357 SIG. I manufacture all of it myself.' They keys are given to members 18 years and over, meaning people under 21 could possible purchase handgun bullets they are not legally entitled to. However local newspaper The Beaver Countian report receiving 'several tips' from locals raising concerns about the machines. Not candy: This vending machine - operated by Sam Piccini, a candidate for Beaver County Sheriff - which distributes firearms ammunition is raising some eyebrows . A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - which regulates the sale of ammunition - confirmed to the newspaper the machines could provide bullets to minors. 'I don't want to speculate as to what is or is not happening in this particular situation, but a licensee can not sell ammunition to anyone under the age of 18, and importantly you can not sell handgun ammunition to individuals under the age of 21,' ATF Special Agent Stephen Bartholomew told the paper. Piccini said he had the idea years ago, and spent time modifying the machines so they could accept larger bills and credit cards, with the price of bullets much higher than that of candy. Piccini, who is a current candidate for Beaver County Sheriff, said he consulted lawyers about the machines and maintains that operating them is perfectly legal.","Sam Piccini retired from the force after 25 years service to start an ammunition manufacturing and wholesale business .

"A teenager who was searching for her missing pet was relieved when she was told someone had found the dog and taken it to the vet, only to find out the animal had been put down. Kerri Lawson, 18, put an appeal on Facebook when her Labrador Homer sneaked out of the garden of her family home in Washington, Tyne and Wear, and disappeared. Her despair initially turned to joy when she was told it had been found by a member of the public who took the animal, which had arthritis which makes him drag his back leg, to a vet. But she was then told by the vet that they had put Homer down because of his condition - without telling his devastated owner first. Kerri Lawson said she was distraught after she found her missing dog had been handed in by a member of the public to the vet, only for staff to decide to put the animal down - without informing her first . Ms Lawson said: 'Homer did have a few health problems, but he was not as bad as the vet said he was. 'They shouldn't have just gone ahead and done this without our say-so.' After Homer, who was 16-years-old, disappeared he was found by a member of the public and taken to Cestria Vets in Chester-le-Street. Vets said he was having trouble breathing and within 24 hours he was put to sleep. Ms Lawson believes the arthritis in his legs, which caused him to drag his back leg and look ill, was known to the vets after Homer was injured in an accident 12 years ago. The student added: 'The problems were known to the vet and they said it was completely fine and there was no need to worry. 'They should have contacted the dog warden at the council to tell them he had been handed in. 'They could have waited. That way, we would have known he had been found - we would have had a point of contact. Miss Lawson said her pet had arthritis in his legs, but claimed veterinary staff had known about his condition . 'We had no way of knowing he'd been taken to the vets.' Homer was not microchipped but Ms Lawson said he had a docked tail and cauliflower ear, making him more distinctive. He was also not wearing a collar. Veterinary staff said they were forced to take action after the Labrador was found 'thin and experiencing breathing difficulties.' A spokeswoman for the practice said staff take their responsibilities to animals very seriously and said it would not have been ethical for them to have admitted such an unwell animal, thought to have been a stray, in such a 'desperate' condition. She added: 'Our obligation to stray animals is to provide such emergency treatment and pain relief as is appropriate and we treat many strays each year, before either successfully reuniting them with their owners, or passing them on to the relevant authorities. The dog was taken to Cestria Veterinary Centre in Chester-le-street, where the dog was then put down . 'Homer was brought in on Saturday morning by a member of the public. We checked our 'lost' register, in which we record details of missing animals reported to the surgery, but found no matching entry. 'We did not attempt to contact the dog warden, as we had previously been informed that they did not operate at weekends. 'The police no longer have legal responsibility for stray dogs and do not maintain a list.' The woman said the animal was examined by two veterinary surgeons who found he was agitated and distressed. Microchipping dogs is to become compulsory by April 2016, along with ensuring all details stored on the microchip are updated. Owners who don't comply can be fined £500. Recent research by the Dogs Trust found that 57 per cent of owners do not realise microchipping will become a legal obligation in 12 months time. They also found 46 per cent of British dog owners do not update their animal's microchip with address details when they move. This is in spite of 22 per cent of owners admitting their dogs strayed within 48 hours of them moving to a new area. The Dogs Trust estimate there are 1,780,000 dogs in the UK who are not microchipped. Around 72 per cent of dog owners are unaware that they only have seven days to recover a missing dog from a Local Authority before they are rehomed or put to sleep. 'Obviously elderly, he was making clawing, repetitive movements of his front legs, but was unable to stand, even when supported and was barely responsive to his surroundings,' she added. 'His lung and heart sounds were muffled and indistinct, he was very thin and was experiencing breathing difficulties. 'They decided that his condition was terminal and considered his prognosis hopeless. 'No palliative treatment could have been provided which would have rendered his condition comfortable, and accordingly he was painlessly put down. 'It is not acceptable, either legally or ethically, for us to admit a stray animal in such a desperate clinical condition to the hospital, in the hope that an owner comes forward. 'It is always with deep regret that we take this drastic action, which is only done to prevent further suffering, but these few unfortunate animals are put down with a gentle touch and a kind word. 'His owners have our deepest sympathy.'","Kerri Lawson's pet Labrador had arthritis which made him drag back leg .

Stella McCartney attends an event to honour Kate Moss last April. The designer is calling on consumers to be more aware of where their food and fashion comes from . In a new interview with The Business Of Fashion (BoF) magazine, she said: 'The consumption of animals - whether you're wearing them or eating them - is extraordinarily damaging to the planet. 'There are over a billion animals killed a year for food, half of which don't even get eaten. And there's over 50 million animals killed just for fashion.' 'If you're mindful of how you're approaching your life, then you see the connection. You can't avoid the connection. 'The connection between food, illness, environment. I want to see everything as a whole, so that's how I approach life, and that's how it comes into my business.' At the start of her fashion career, many criticised Stella - who helped kick off the vegetarian movement Meat Free Mondays with her father - for her refusal to produce and clothes with leather, fur or feathers. But while the mother-of-four is something of a pioneer in ethical high fashion, she concedes that finding high-quality substitutes is a challenge. Stella and her father Paul following the Stella McCartney Green Carpet Collection during London Fashion Week in September 2014 . ‘Material is hard,' she said: . ‘Clearly leather is a great material. It wears well. It moves. You can wash it. It’s real. One of the hardest things is to design something that is desirable and then to take that design and make it in a way that is not conventional. 'We’re sourcing our own material, developing our own material - we’re not using PVC.’ And, ahead of a lecture she is holding with the magazine tonight in London, Stella said she even feels the need to apologise to her designers  for the limitations of using non-leather alternatives.

"Hillary Rodham Clinton may be the Democratic Party's presidential front-runner, but the former secretary of state's poll numbers don't make her look the part. Her 'favorable' rating – a measure of how many Americans see her in a positive light – is now 'under water,' meaning that she has fewer fans than detractors. A CBS News poll released Thursday found that just 26 per cent see her favorably, compared with 37 per cent who don't. The rest, about one-third of those polled, haven't made up their minds. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE SURVEY RESULTS . UNDER WATER: Clinton's 'positive' poll numbers now trail her 'negatives' by 11 percentage points . READY TO REBOUND? Clinton's favorability numbers are only a few points higher today than when they hit an all-time low, according to a CBS poll – right after her memoir 'Hard Choices' hit bookshelves . Unsurprisingly, Clinton's 'unfavorable' numbers are high among Republicans, registering 78 per cent. Barely half of Democrats, though – just 55 per cent – say they hold favorable views of her. That number is down 8 points since November 2013. Across the entire voting spectrum, Clinton has lost 12 points of support in the intervening 16 months. Her high-water mark in the CBS poll came just two months after she took over the U.S. State Department in early 2009, when 58 per cent of Americans said they liked her. But the wheels fell off shortly after she left the Obama administration: When her memoir 'Hard Choices' his bookshelves, her favorability number bottomed out at 24 per cent. The most recent survey, conducted March 21-24, shows she's barely rebounded since then. WAITING IN THE WINGS: A deep field of Republicans including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (left), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (center) and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (right) is chomping at the bit and waiting for a chance to attack Clinton . There's bad news also for Clinton-backers who hope her 'email-gate' scandal has only temporarily poisoned the public perceptions. Two-thirds of those surveyed said the brewing scandal had no impact on their opinion, giving her precious little ground to make up even if the controversy fades. In addition to Clinton's use of a private, unaudited email server for all her messages while she was the Obama administration's top diplomat, she continues to be dogged by accusations that her family foundation accepted millions of dollars from foreign governments during the same timeframe. CBS pollsters did not ask whether that embarrassing news had an impact on how Americans see her. But her responses to the email kerfuffle have produced mixed results. Americans appear evenly divided over whether Clinton's explanations satisfied their concerns. Forty-two per cent said yes, while 40 per cent said no. LONG MEMORY: Some part of voters' negative impressions of Mrs. Clinton may harken back to her time as first lady . Thirty-eight per cent said they believe Clinton kept the State Department out of the loop on her emails principally to shield work-related communications from the public. Forty-nine percent believed her claim that she did it out of 'convenience.' On balance, Clinton's biggest hurdle may be her own words, stretching back into the 1990s when she was America's first lady. Forty-seven per cent of the people CBS polled said they don't believe she is 'honest and trustworthy' – 5 per cent more than the number who came down on Mrs. Clinton's side.

"Hundreds of viewers have complained that Ed Miliband was given a harder time in the first TV contest of the election campaign. TV watchdogs were inundated with complaints as senior Labour figures accused presenter Kay Burley of intervening 'aggressively' on the Labour leader as he took questions from the studio audience. But Burley brushed off the criticism, insisting she thought Mr Miliband 'did brilliantly' during the programme, as polls showed David Cameron secured a narrow victory over his opponent. Hundreds of people have lodged complaints with TV watchdogs that Kay Burley and Jeremy Paxman were biased against Ed Miliband . Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband faced the wrath of voters - and Jeremy Paxman - last night as they were forced to defend their broken promises, judgement and ability to lead the country in the first prime-time TV contest of the general election. They were interviewed by Paxman for 18 minutes each, and also took questions from a studio audience with Ms Burley acting as moderator on the show broadcast on Sky News and Channel 4. This afternoon Ofcom had received 254 complaints  - all of which were about perceived bias against the Labour leader. It is thought they have been generated by a social media campaign sharing a link to the watchdog's website and urging people to complain. An Ofcom spokesman said: 'We are assessing the complaints before deciding whether or not to investigate.' A Channel 4 spokeswoman said it had received around 300 complaints, but was unable to say specifically what they were about. 'Both politicians, one of whom is likely to be the next Prime Minister, agreed to the format and were prepared for and actively participated in robust questioning about their policies and abilities. Neither party has expressed any dissatisfaction to Channel 4,' she added. Labour insiders privately noted that they thought Burley 'intervened and followed up aggressively a number of times'. At one point Burley told Mr Miliband: 'That's a politicians answer there isn't it?' She also pressed him on the impact of his leadership victory over his brother David. When the Labour leader said family relations had been strained, Burley responded: 'Your poor mum.' In a series of posts on Twitter, Burley took on her critics. Burley took to Twitter to hit back at her critics online, insisting she thought Mr Miliband 'did brilliantly with the audience' While Mr Cameron was asked about treating the elderly with dignity and the depth of spending cuts, Mr Miliband faced a series of aggressive questions. The Tory leader's first question from the audience was: 'What do you think are Ed Miliband’s best qualities?' One of the few off-the-cuff questions from Burley to the PM was: 'Have you ever had three shredded wheat?' When Mr Miliband face the audience, he was frist asked: 'You sound gloomy most of the time, are things really so bad?' Another asked: 'Do you not think that your brother would have done a better job? He was better qualified and better positioned.' Paxman suggested that even Labour MPs considered Miliband a 'liability' and that he was seen as 'a north London geek' by many voters, who thought: 'What a shame it's not his brother' Mr Miliband faced a difficult ride time from both the studio audience and Paxman about whether he is tough enough to lead the country . Former England footballer Stan Collymore said Burley 'Virtually gave Dave a hug and a kiss. Embarrassing.' Mocking him for not using her Twitter handle, she hit back: '@StanCollymore Stan, its @KayBurley if you need to slag me off directly. Surely you remember from when your were direct messaging me.' The live 90-minute show, called Cameron & Miliband Live: The Battle For Number 10 pulled in an average audience of 2.6 million viewers on Channel 4 and a further 322,000 on Sky News. Channel 4 boss Jay Hunt described the show as 'vintage Paxman'. During the Q&A Mr Miliband was challenged over why he is so gloomy, out of touch and not as good as his brother. A snap poll showed 54 per cent of people thought Mr Cameron won on the night, with 46 per cent backing Mr Miliband. In the ICM poll for the Guardian, Mr Cameron narrowly beat Mr Miliband on having the best arguments, seeming more convincing and having the more appealing personality. But out of those who said they may change their minds on which way to vote, 56 per cent said they could move to Labour against just 30 per cent for the Conservatives. The two men vying for the keys to Number 10 on May 7 did not go head-to-head but instead appeared separately to be interviewed by Paxman and questioned by an audience of voters. Jeremy Paxman appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing Prime Minister David Cameron . Mr Miliband was forced to insist that he 'tough enough' to be Prime Minister, including standing up to the likes . But Mr Miliband faced a difficult ride time from both the studio audience and Paxman about whether he is tough enough to lead the country. The Labour leader insisted: 'Am I tough enough? Hell, yes, I'm tough enough.' Paxman suggested that even Labour MPs considered Miliband a 'liability' and that he was seen as 'a north London geek' by many voters, who thought: 'What a shame it's not his brother.' Paxman told him how he had met a man on the tube who said the Labour leader would not survive an encounter with Putin. Mr Miliband insisted: 'I don't care. I don't care what the newspapers say.' Apparently taken aback by the onslaught, Mr Miliband claimed he did not read bad press about himself, adding: 'It's water off a duck's back, honestly. 'The thing I've learnt most in this job is to be yourself. That's what I am. People have to decide - do they want my ideas, do they want my principles when I stood up not just to President Obama, but Rupert Murdoch, the energy companies, the banks, fighting for ordinary people, which is what I believe in and what I came into politics for?'","Ofcom receives more than 250 complaints that TV contest was biased .

"Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders has announced a review of all forthcoming trials or retrials regarding the prosecution of journalists . The prosecution of journalists accused of paying public officials for leaks was in turmoil last night after law chiefs announced a review of all forthcoming trials or retrials. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, made the decision as anger grew that a ‘witch-hunt’ had been conducted to pursue reporters who exposed stories kept secret because they embarrassed those in power. Last week, Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, expressed misgivings that the obscure 13th century law of misconduct in public office was being used to haul journalists before the courts. Police and prosecutors have faced criticism for spending up to £20million of taxpayers’ money on Operation Elveden, an investigation into tabloid newspapers paying for information, rather than concentrating on terrorism and violent crime. Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service have brought to trial 24 journalists as part of the investigation, launched in the wake of phone-hacking allegations. But only three have been found guilty. And of those, a former News of the World reporter had her conviction for paying a prison officer for leaks quashed last week, while fellow journalist Ryan Sabey was given leave to appeal. The NoW reporter was the first journalist found guilty under Elveden and received a six-month suspended jail sentence. But on Friday, Lord Thomas overturned her conviction after finding Judge Charles Wide, who presided over the trial, ‘misdirected’ the jury over the ‘level of seriousness’ required to have committed an offence. Now it has emerged that the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will not face a retrial. Two co-defendants also had their convictions quashed but the prison officer is expected to be tried again. Mrs Saunders made the decision after holding emergency talks about the future of the prosecutions of the Press with senior barristers and the Metropolitan Police. A CPS spokesman said: ‘The Court of Appeal judgment from last week does not call into question the prosecution of the appellants concerned but considered that the jury needed greater direction on how serious offending must be to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust. ‘This ruling has been very carefully considered in relation to the cases against these three individuals and we have informed the Court of Appeal this afternoon of our decisions concerning retrials in each of those cases.’ The spokesman said the CPS would ‘consider the wider implications of last week’s judgment on this case and others within Operation Elveden’. Legal sources said Mrs Saunders had been forced to consider an ‘exit strategy’ after the so-called media crime investigations descended into chaos, with juries showing a reluctance to convict journalists who paid money for stories that were clearly in the public interest. Earlier this month, four Sun journalists  were acquitted of making illegal payments for stories. Former colour sergeant John Hardy, 44, was found not guilty of misconduct in a public office. Pictured left to right: Duncan Larcombe, John Hardy, Geoff Webster, Fergus Shanahan and John Kay . Earlier this month, four Sun journalists – John Kay, Duncan Larcombe, Fergus Shanahan, and Geoff Webster – were dramatically acquitted at the Old Bailey of making illegal payments for stories. And in January, a jury failed to reach verdicts in the trial of four current and former Sun journalists – Chris Pharo, Jamie Pyatt, Ben O’Driscoll and Graham Dudman. Their planned retrial in September will now be reviewed. Two fellow defendants – The Sun’s picture editor, John Edwards, and former reporter John Troup – were cleared of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office after a trial at Kingston Crown Court. Operation Elveden has seen journalists’ homes raided by police at dawn – a practice normally reserved for terror suspects and organised criminals – large numbers of arrests and reporters being kept on bail for up to three years. Critics have described the investigation as a ‘waste of public money’ and accused police and prosecutors of pursuing a ‘vendetta’ against journalists. A new Elveden trial was yesterday adjourned until April 24 in the wake of last week’s ruling. It involves a reporter who cannot be identified for legal reasons and prison officer Alan Hagan, 48, from Liverpool. They deny misconduct in public office. Eight trials and retrials involving tabloid journalists charged under Operation Elveden are scheduled between now and September.

"Mayfair on the Monopoly board may be worth only £400, but with soaring house prices the reality today is eye-wateringly different. A four-storey townhouse in the exclusive London area now sells for £40million, while even a flat in the cheapest Monopoly area of Whitechapel has gone for nearly £5million. In light of such ludicrous prices, one estate agent has now re-imagined the classic board game – set in desirable English market towns. The new Mayfair is picturesque Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, where homes go for more than £872,000 on average. Petworth, in the South Downs National Park in West Sussex, is the second most exclusive town on the board, taking the place of Park Lane. Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road – both worth £60 and often seen as the game’s dud streets unless you can build a hotel on them – have been replaced by Morpeth and Wooler in Northumberland, where average houses sell for about £220,000. Upmarket estate agent Savills has also reinvented Bond Street, Regent Street and Oxford Street as Harpenden, Berkhamsted, and Bushey, all in Hertfordshire, where family homes routinely sell for more than £500,000. Piccadilly, Leicester Square and Coventry Street, priced at between £260 and £280, become Salcombe in Devon, and Chipping Campden and Northleach in the Cotswolds. At the slightly cheaper end, Ilkley in West Yorkshire becomes the new Northumberland Avenue, nearby Wetherby replaces Pall Mall, and Poynton in Cheshire is £120 Pentonville Road. Lucian Cook, of Savills, said: ‘We looked for towns with the highest average value across different regions of the UK.’ The current version of Monopoly was printed by Parker Brothers in 1935, although earlier versions date back to 1904.","Soaring house prices illustrate Monopoly's now outdated property values .

"Amnesty International has concluded that Hamas committed war crimes during the 2014 Gaza conflict by firing rockets 'indiscriminately' at civilian areas and using non-combatants as human shields. 'In launching these attacks, [Palestinian jihadis] displayed a flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law and for the consequences of their violations on civilians in both Israel and the Gaza Strip,' said Philip Luther, Amnesty's director for the Middle East and North Africa. The report concluded that rocket attacks had killed six civilians in Israel, including a child. Other rockets aimed at the Jewish state fell short and killed at least 13 Palestinian civilians, 11 of them children, on the beach in Gaza, in an attack that was wrongly blamed on Israel. Scroll down for video . War crimes: Amnesty International has found that Palestinian militants displayed 'flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law' by firing rockets from civilian areas into civilian areas . Pain: Family members and relatives of four-year-old Daniel Tregerman, who was killed by shrapnel from a Palestinian rocket, mourn during his funeral in 2014 . Deadly: A rocket is fired from Gaza City towards Israel. Amnesty International described them as 'indiscriminate', and said that they killed more Palestinians than Israelis when they misfired . Palestinian witnesses had claimed that an Israeli F-16 warplane had killed Palestinian civilians on the beach. But the Amnesty report has corroborated the Israeli army's account of events, which said that the deaths occurred when militants misfired their own rockets. 'An independent munitions expert who examined the available evidence... concluded that the projectile used in the attack was a Palestinian rocket,' the report said. It confirmed that during the 50-day war, Palestinian terrorists launched unguided rockets and mortars from civilian areas toward other civilian areas, constituting a breach of international law. Figures released by the Israeli army after the war ended on 26 August showed that Gaza militants fired 4,591 projectiles at Israel. Of those, 3,659 struck Israeli territory and 735 were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system, leaving another 197 falling short and landing inside the coastal enclave. Militant groups used unguided projectiles which were 'inherently indiscriminate,' the report said, noting that this is 'prohibited under international law' and 'constitutes a war crime'. Luther demanded that Palestinian armed groups 'end all direct attacks on civilians', and take all feasible precautions 'to protect civilians in the Gaza Strip from the effects of such attacks', including launching attacks 'within or near densely populated areas.' Other war crimes committed by Palestinian terrorists  included storing munitions in civilian buildings and U.N. schools and launching attacks from areas densely populated with civilians, effectively using them as human shields. Luther called on both Israeli and Palestinian authorities to cooperate with U.N. and International Criminal Court probes 'to end decades of impunity that have perpetuated a cycle of violations in which civilians on both sides have paid a heavy price'. Hamas official Taher al-Nounou denied the allegations in the Amnesty report, saying that Hamas did not target civilians. An Islamic Jihad spokesman, Daud Shihab, said that the rocket fire was in self-defence, and did little damage in comparison to Israel's weapons. The 50-day Gaza war claimed the lives of about 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis.","Palestinian jihadis fired rockets indiscriminately at civilians, from civilian areas, which constitutes a war crime .

"An anorexic teenager whose weight dropped to just five stone is fighting back from the condition by setting up a catering business. Faith March, 18 from Maldon, Essex, was surviving on nothing other than coffee when she dropped to her lowest weight in March of last year. After several ill-fated attempts to fight the illness, Faith collapsed in her bathroom where she was found by her boyfriend - and her family told her they feared for her life if she didn't get help. Scroll down for video . Faith March's weight dropped to just five stone when she was suffering from anorexia (left) but she is now in recovery and has set up her own patisserie business (right) After treatment at the Priory Hospital in Chelmsford, Faith is now at a healthier weight and credits the starting of her patisserie business, Whisk of Faith, as kick-starting her recovery. Faith said: 'This business has helped me get out of a massive hole. If I'm honest, it was a hole I never thought I would get out of. It just seemed like a never-ending cycle of problems.' Faith says she has had problems with her stomach which have baffled doctors for most of her life, but at 14 she was finally told her colon had collapsed and had surgery to insert a stent into her stomach. That returned her to some sort of normality, but in March last year her eating problems began to worsen and those around her began to notice. Faith said: 'My boyfriend, mum and dad noticed I had stopped eating again, I was just surviving on coffee,' she said. 'I was doing a cookery course at the time as well as working part time at a pub so I was surrounded by food but I just couldn't bring myself to eat anything.

'I knew I always had problems with food but to actually be diagnosed as anorexic just played havoc with my mind. Faith continued: 'I tried to combat it in so many ways that I look back on now and think 'what was I doing?' such as just staying in bed, working out at the gym all the time and just generally not accepting help. Then, a terrifying episode later that year made it hit home just how bad her problem was. Faith said: 'After one long day working from 11am until 10pm at the pub in which I hadn't eaten, my boyfriend found me collapsed on the bathroom floor. Faith's weight plummeted to just five stone but she is not much healthier (right) Pretty Faith poses with her boyfriend Alex who raised the alarm after he discovered her collapsed on the bathroom floor . 'I can't remember much about what happened but he said I couldn't go back there as I was just too unwell. 'We went on holiday and my family told me they thought I would die if I carried on working in that environment. 'It hit me then. I realised something needed to be done to save my life. Faith quit her job and spent time at home recuperating, which got her thinking about ways to get herself better. 'I always wanted my own business so Mum told me to maybe do some work for myself while I get better,' she said. 'I had been at cooking college and it was something I wanted to do for a living, so I started doing cakes and getting people ordering from me and it's just grown from there.'

Faith says that having her new business has helped her to start eating again after suffering for years with anorexia . Mum Heather has been helping out and Faith said that, while there is still a long way to go for both her condition and her business, she is optimistic for the future. 'I still have to have check-ups twice a week but I'm weighing just over eight stone now which is a lot healthier than I was,' she said. 'My parents have been so supportive by letting me run the business from home and my boyfriend has been a tower of strength as well. 'The business started small but it has just kept growing and growing.

"Alex Salmond suggested that jettisoning an attempt by the Conservatives to govern alone would allow the SNP to prop up a minority Labour administration . Alex Salmond has threatened to bring down a Conservative minority government, even if David Cameron wins more seats than Ed Miliband. The former Scottish First Minister said the Scottish National Party would vote down a Tory Queen's Speech if it holds the balance of power after the general election. Latest polls suggest the SNP will gain dozens of seats in Scotland, depriving Labour of a majority and able to call the shots in Westminster. Mr Salmond suggested that jettisoning an attempt by the Conservatives to govern alone would allow the SNP to prop up a minority Labour administration. The Tories said it was proof the SNP would 'sabotage the democratic will of the British people' to install Mr Miliband in Downing Street. Speaking to the New Statesman magazine, Mr Salmond said the SNP could enter a 'confidence and supply' arrangement with Labour - under which the smaller party would agree not to bring down a minority government in return for concessions on particular priorities. But he said it was more probable that it would offer its support on a vote-by-vote basis and would make amendments to any budget put forward by Ed Balls to introduce 'progressive tax measures'. With opinion polls suggesting the SNP are headed for dozens of gains from Labour and the Liberal Democrats north of the border, Mr Salmond - who is standing in the Gordon seat being vacated by veteran Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce - would say only that he expects the party to win 'a barrel-load' of seats at Westminster. He predicted that Lib Dems would not be 'a big factor' in negotiations on forming the new government, as 'if the Liberals are reduced to half their MPs the last thing they're going to be doing is going into a coalition'. 'The surviving half will want to survive,' he said. This would mean the SNP, unionist parties from Northern Ireland and other smaller parties would be crucial to the outcome. Mr Salmond rejected Labour's argument that the party with the most seats after the May 7 poll will have the opportunity to form the government, insisting that the key question is which leader can command a majority in the Commons. 'The Tories would have to go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course, and we'd be voting against,' said Mr Salmond. 'So if Labour joins us in that pledge, then that's Cameron locked out. And then under the (Fixed-Term) Parliaments Act that the Westminster parliament's passed but nobody seems to have read, you'd then have a two-week period to form another government - and of course you want to form another government because this might be people's only chance to form another government.' The SNP would act to prop up a Labour government with Ed Miliband in Number 10, even if David Cameron wins more seats . Although Mr Cameron would remain incumbent Prime Minister until a new government was formed, the Act - passed by the coalition in 2011 - would restrict his ability to call a new election in the hope of securing a decisive result, said Mr Salmond. The former SNP leader said he had 'no idea' whether a Labour government emerging from such a process would have Mr Miliband as its leader, and suggested that he was wrong to have ruled out formal coalition with the SNP so firmly . 'If I were him, I wouldn't have ruled it out,' said Mr Salmond. 'Nicola (Sturgeon, the SNP leader) has always said that she thought full coalition was unlikely. But she didn't rule it out: she said it was highly unlikely ... It's still highly unlikely.' Asked what he saw as the probable outcome, Mr Salmond said: 'I think probable would be vote-by-vote (support for Labour), and possible would be confidence and supply.' A new poll of voters in Scotland this week put Labour down to just 27 per cent, which Professor John Curtice says could leave the party with just two MPs, the same number as the Tories . Mr Salmond said it was 'bad politics' for Mr Cameron to float the prospect of English votes for English laws on the morning after last year's independence referendum and said it was now 'not a question of if, but when' a second referendum on separation from the rest of the UK would take place. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. 'That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune. The only way to protect Trident, keep Britain together and safeguard the economy is to vote Conservative.'","Ex-SNP leader says he would lead revolt against a Tory Queen's Speech .

"Twenty-five people have been hospitalised after an Air Canada flight made a crash landing at Halifax Stanfield International Airport earlier this morning. It has been reported the Airbus A320 crashed into a power line on landing, and then skidded off the runway. The airline said a preliminary count showed Flight AC624 from Toronto had 132 passengers and five crew members, and had set out from Toronto Pearson International Airport. Scroll down for video . The Airbus A320 skidded off the runway at the Halifax airport in bad weather, and 25 people were taken to a hospital for observation and treatment . It's no wonder why many passengers were treated for injuries as the force of impact was substantial . The crash landing caused extensive damage to the win and nose of the Air Canada plane . A passenger on the plane, Treasure Addison-Mills, speaking to NBC News said there were 'people with bloody faces', and that it 'took a long time being stranded on the runway with snow coming down.' 'We are thankful no serious injuries have been reported,' Halifax Stanfield International Airport tweeted. The airport said its airfield remained closed. Another passenger on the flight Mike Magnus, a businessman, said the plane was at the 'furthest tip of the airport' when it stopped. He says he heard that the plane may have clipped a power line that caused the power outage at the airport. 'It was so chaotic at the time. I'm pretty sure the landing gear broke on it. The engine on my side popped off,' the 60-year-old  from Halifax. The future running of the Air Canada plane could well be up for debate with the damage severe . Passengers Randy Hall, left, and Lianne Clark, from Mount Uniacke, Canada stand waiting at an airport hotel after Air Canada flight 624 left the runway . Magnus believes at least one engine was torn off the Airbus A320. He says the nose of the plane was sheared off and he believes the wings were damaged too. He added that the snow that covered the runway likely deadened any sparks that may have caused a fire and engulfed the plane. 'The snow caused it and the snow saved it,' he said. Mike Magnus was a passenger on board the Air Canada flight that crashed through a power wire . This photo shows the impact the crash landing had on the nose of the plane at Halifax Airport . Magnus was released from hospital after being treated for minor injuries to his shoulder and jaw. 'I'm safe and that's all that matters. I'm going to have a glass of wine,' he said. Airport spokesman Peter Spurway said the aircraft touched down in stormy conditions. 'It came down pretty hard and then skidded off the runway,' Spurway said. He said he didn't know whether runway conditions played a role. Passengers were ushered inside the terminal, where 25 were then taken to hospital . The rescue operation can now begin to remove the stricken Airbus A320 from the Halifax runway .

The Halifax region is currently under a snowfall warning, with an Environment Canada alert stating that 'visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.' Power went off at the airport, which meant an emergency response centre had to be moved to a nearby hotel.

"Police sought answers Wednesday from a retired correction officer after his dispute with a pair of strangers ended with a fatal shooting. Former officer, Willie Groomes, 69, shot Gilbert Drogheo at about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn, police said. Drogheo's uncle declared Groomes to be 'a murderer' on Wednesday night. Scroll down for video... Killed: Victim Gilbert Drogheo, 32, was killed after a scuffle on the 4 train on Tuesday night . Altercation: Cell phone footage taken by a witness and shared with CBS New York shows an older man approaching a younger man at the subway station and getting into a scuffle before a shot is heard . Terrifying: A blurred figure can be seen near to where the altercation occurred on Tuesday evening . He said that his nephew was a dedicated electrician. 'He was a great kid,' the uncle said. 'All he did was work,' he told the Daily News. Investigators took Groomes into custody on Wednesday but later released him without charges. The shooting  spread panic inside a subway station at the height of the evening rush hour when the retired officer, who's 69 years old, boarded a Brooklyn-bound subway train in Manhattan. He was armed with a small Ruger handgun that he was licensed to carry in public. According to witnesses, it appeared that the former officer angered Drogheo, 32, and another man by stepping in between them while they were talking, police said. Emergency: Ambulances carry away an injured man; Gilbert Drogheo was pronounced dead in hospital after he was shot in the torso and the ex-corrections officer was taken away for treatment for a minor injury . The men and the officer argued before they pushed him down into an empty seat on the train, police said. All three men exited the train at the next stop in Brooklyn, where there was a second confrontation on the station's mezzanine level, police said. The retired officer tussled with Drogheo before pulling his weapon and firing one round, which struck the victim in the chest, they said. New York Police Department officers assigned to the station heard the gunshot and quickly detained the shooting suspect. Drogheo, who was from Harlem, died at a hospital. The other man was taken into custody. Television station WCBS broadcast a cellphone video showing a man it identified as the retired officer cornering a smaller man near an exit in the subway station and pushing him. The men are seen struggling before a gunshot is heard and bystanders scatter. Subway passenger Thomas Berry, who witnessed the dispute, told the Daily News the older man had initially tried to avoid trouble. Rush hour shooting: A 32-year-old man was fatally shot by a retired corrections officer during the shooting . Deadly confrontation: Witnesses said the fight began when the older man stepped between two men . The officer told the other two men, ''Leave me alone. Don't talk to me,'' Berry said. 'He was being really calm.' But as the dispute grew more heated, the older man flashed a gun, Berry said. 'Everyone said 'gun' and ran off the train,' he said. 'I was standing there in shock.' A cell phone video obtained by CBS New York revealed the moment the officer allegedly shot and fatally wounded Drogheo. The two exchange words and the older man apparently pushes the younger man, the video shows. Just seconds later, a shot is heard. Drogheo was shot in the torso. Other images captured by witnesses and shared with NBC show a man on the ground. He was rushed to Brooklyn Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead. Fight: The 69-year-old gunman was reportedly heard telling his opponents, 'don't touch me' before the brawl . Tempers flare: The 69-year-old former jail guard got on the crowded train at Bowling Green station and was trying to walk past the duo when some words were exchanged . Witnesses described the chaotic scene after hearing the gunshot ricochet through the station during one of the busiest travel times of the day. Fatima Manuel told CBS she was confused by the sound at first. 'Like a 'pow, pow' sound,' she said. 'Sounded like a firecracker, but then I said: 'No, that's not a firecracker. That's more like a gunshot'.'. Another subway user, Donny Dushi, added: 'It's the scariest thing to even hear about. Wherever you are in the city - regardless if it's Brooklyn, the city, Queens, just knowing the transportation you take every day, it can happen to anybody.'","A person identifying himself as the uncle of slain straphanger Gilbert Drogheo, 32, called retired jailer Willie Groomes ""a murderer""

"Max Clifford has been arrested in connection with allegations of sexual offences by detectives from Operation Yewtree, it has been reported . Disgraced PR guru Max Clifford has been arrested in connection with allegations of sexual offences by detectives from Operation Yewtree, it has been reported. Scotland Yard said a 71-year-old had been questioned at a police station in Peterborough. Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years last May after being convicted of a string of indecent assaults, carried out between 1977 and 1984, using his celebrity connections to lure women. He is currently serving his sentence at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire, which is not far from Peterborough. The former celebrity agent, who branded his accusers 'fantasists', denied the charges, but was convicted at London's Southwark Crown Court. It is understood that today's arrest relates to a number of separate allegations of sex offences. Following Clifford's sentencing last year, Scotland Yard confirmed that other people had come forward with allegations. Police have not named the individual who was arrested today, but did say that the man was 'not new' to the Operation Yewtree investigation. Clifford was named on Twitter by Mark Williams-Thomas, the man who exposed Jimmy Savile's crimes in an award-winning ITV investigation. He posted: 'Max Clifford (71) arrested today re allegations of sexual offences,He was interviewed at a police station in Peterborough. #OP.Yewtree'. Minutes later, he added: 'As previously stated today's arrest of Max Clifford relates to number of separate allegations of sex offences that CPS have been advising on.' Mr Williams-Thomas, a former police officer who specialised in child protection and major crime, was the first person to expose Savile. Operation Yewtree is the police probe set up in the wake of disclosures that former BBC DJ Jimmy Savile was a prolific paedophile. Clifford, pictured, was jailed for eight years last May after being convicted of a string of indecent assaults, carried out between 1977 and 1984, using his celebrity connections to lure women . The investigation has three strands of inquiry. One relates to Savile's crimes and the second relates to allegations against Savile and others. The third strand, under which Clifford is understood to have been questioned, concentrates on accusations unconnected to the Savile investigations but which emerged as a result of the publicity surrounding the late DJ. A Scotland Yard spokesman said it has spoken to 17 people as part of the Yewtree investigation. High-profile: Gary Glitter, left, and Rolf Harris, right, have both been convicted under Operation Yewtree . He said: 'This is not a new individual to Operation Yewtree. This is not an 18th individual.' Inquiries continue, he added. Last month, Gary Glitter, who was the first person to be arrested under Operation Yewtree, became the fourth high-profile figure to be convicted under  the investigation. Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and children's entertainer Rolf Harris have also been found guilty of historic sexual offences.

"Changes to pension rules could result in a flood of spam texts and calls from fraudsters to savers, the privacy watchdog warned last night. The Information Commissioner's Office warned that pension scams could be the 'next PPI' with rogue firms bombarding the public with messages in an effort to get them to sign up to dubious schemes. Yesterday Pensions Minister Steve Webb, architect of the reforms, said anyone cold called by a firm offering them a free pensions review should 'put the phone down'. There is already growing evidence that scammers are gearing up for the April 6 pension 'liberation day' In three weeks Britain will undergo a pensions revolution allowing older workers to cash in their pension pots and spend the money as they wish, rather than having to buy an annuity . 'You can spend years saving into a pension only to find yourself tricked out of your money in the blink of an eye,' he warned. In three weeks Britain will undergo a pensions revolution allowing older workers to cash in their pension pots and spend the money as they wish, rather than having to buy an annuity. But the ICO fears it could be a bonanza for sharks and 'snake oil salesmen' targeting older people with texts and cold calls to try to get their hands on their pension pots. Anyone who hands over their investment as a result of scam messages could be left penniless – and still facing a huge tax bill. Criminals are urging pension savers to invest in scams ranging from dubious wealth funds to overseas homes that do not even exist. There is already growing evidence that scammers are gearing up for the April 6 pension 'liberation day'. Tricks include luring pensioners with the promise of impartial advice. The number of spam calls and texts related to pensions reported to the watchdog rose by 66 per cent in February. Pensions Minister Mr Webb has in recent months admitted he himself was cold called and sent spam texts about pensions. Yesterday Pensions Minister Steve Webb, architect of the reforms, said anyone cold called by a firm offering them a free pensions review should 'put the phone down' Last month he told a conference he had received a text saying: 'If you have a frozen pension prior to 55 you are entitled to a free review. Please call back.' Yesterday the ICO served a legal notice on a company in Swansea, Help Direct UK, for sending nearly 190,000 spam texts including many thousands about pensions. One message said: 'As you have over 10k in your pension, your pension has lost £3,219.43 over the last few years, to get back & find out your payout reply REVIEW.' The message was identified by the ICO as being both deeply misleading and sent to those who had not signed up for direct marketing, as the law requires. They fear claims farmers are using the promise of free advice or a windfall investment to gather thousands of pensioner details to sell on in the wake of the reforms. The ICO said Help Direct UK told a 'web of lies' about how it obtained the recipients' contact details. The enforcement notice requires the firm to stop its activities or it could face court action. New rules which come into force on the same day as the pensions reforms will allow the ICO to impose fines of up to half a million pounds on cold call and nuisance text firms. Andy Curry of the ICO said: 'There is clearly the potential for a huge spike in the number of these scam texts and calls. It has the potential to be the next PPI.' The Pensions Regulator added its voice to the warnings. Chief executive Lesley Titcomb said: 'The people behind pension scams are often agile, sophisticated and organised. We expect the scams to continue to evolve.' Martin Wheatley, chief executive of another regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, said he was seeing an 'accelerating trend' in activity by fraudsters. The reforms were widely welcomed last year as a response to concerns that annuities had become poor value for money. Retirement pots can be used like a bank account, with many restrictions abolished. There have been concerns, however, that some pensioners might squander their savings on cars or holidays. How crooks will target you . Promised pension freedoms herald a bright new dawn for millions of savers. Unfortunately, they will also act as a clarion call for crooks to target millions of pounds about to be unlocked by the trusting and the unwary. The danger lies in scammers' ability to contact you by phone, text or email – and their persistence to wear you down. Their first approach is usually the most enticing. A text might typically offer a 'free pension review', 'one-off investment opportunity' or promise of 'upfront cash'. But the minute you respond to the cold-caller, they'll begin to crank up the pressure. Their prize is your pension pot – and they need you to agree to sign a funds transfer form to get their hands on it. So the promises will come thick and fast. They might suggest juicy returns of 8 per cent or more, talk authoritatively about locking away cash in overseas investments or dangle cashback payments. To soothe fears, they may also claim to be a Government adviser or say they've been endorsed by officials. And while there will be talk of you, at 55, having plenty of time to lock your money away, there will be no mention of the imminent tax bill you'll need to pay. The fee they'll charge, perhaps as high as 30 per cent, will be glossed over. It might take a dozen or so emails and phone calls – or even ten times that – but once you're hooked, they'll then push you to sign a transfer form as soon as possible. This may be sent to you by email as a form to fill in online or even couriered over to your front door. You'll be convinced it's a simple final matter of filling in the details of your existing pension scheme – usually its name and number. Legally, your original pension provider – usually an insurer – can only agree to transfer the money on the condition it will go straight to another registered pension plan.However, the scammers – acting as the broker – do no such thing. They'll take the money and then release only a chunk of it to you as a loan or cash sum. And once your funds are released from your insurer and into a new account – often overseas and outside UK jurisdiction or the arm of the regulator – then your chances of ever seeing the cash again will vanish. You may find the scammer picks up the phone the first time you call to check up on your investment – but they won't be there the next time. As well as the hefty fee, HMRC will then slap you with a tax charge of up to 55 per cent because you've taken out an 'unauthorised payment' from your pension. Always check the credentials of the company and any advisers, who should be registered with the Financial Conduct Authority at fca.org.uk. If you think a company is trying to get you to liberate your pension, report the company to Action Fraud or call it on 0300 123 2040. It can prosecute companies found breaking the law.","In three weeks Britain will undergo a pensions revolution as rules change .

"An aristocratic actress turned environmentalist has halted plans for one of Britain’s first factory pig farms after teaming up with TV star Dominic West. Marchioness of Worcester Tracy Somerset and her campaign group, which included Eton-educated West, star of The Wire, fought for four years against the proposal for an indoor farm to house 25,000 pigs. The Marchioness, 56, whose best-known role was as Tessa Robinson in the 1980s TV detective series C.A.T.S. Eyes, argued that the farming practice is cruel and leaves the animals unwell and stressed. Victory: Tracy, Marchioness of Worcester has won a battle against a factory pig farm in Derbyshire . Enthusiast: The actress turned aristocrat is an outspoken campaigner for animal rights . Midland Pig Producers has now withdrawn its application, saying it did so because the Environment Agency objected to smells that would affect residents near the planned pig farm at Foston, Derbyshire. The Marchioness, whose husband Henry is heir to the Badminton estate in Gloucestershire, said the decision was a ‘victory for all who care about animals’. The peeress, an outspoken campaigner for sustainable farming, said: 'Intensive, indoor animal factories belong to the past. 'We hope this means people are waking up to the importance of knowing where their food comes from as well as the hidden costs of intensive farming. 'There is mounting evidence that industrial, intensive pig-rearing systems not only cause stress and illness in animals but also threaten human health.' The former actress married Henry Somerset, heir to the Duke of Beaufort and the Badminton Estate, in 1987, although the couple separated last year. Star: The former actress is pictured left with  Leslie Ash in C.A.T.S. Eyes, and right as Miss Scarlet in Cluedo . Aristocrat: Lady Worcester married Henry, Marquess of Worcester, in 1987 and recently separated from him . Activist: The campaigner led a protest against a proposed farm which she claimed would be cruel . After retiring from acting following a career which included playing Miss Scarlet in TV game show Cluedo, she became an animal welfare activist. She has previously broken into factory farms in Poland and South America in order to stage protests there, and lobbied spectators at the Badminton Horse Trials held on her own family's estate. Lady Worcester said today: 'Industrial-scale farming threatens the livelihood of high welfare farmers in rural communities. 'The regular over-use of antibiotics in factory farm systems has produced antibiotic-resistant superbugs. 'In addition, they pollute water and air as well as damaging local businesses.' As well as her animal rights advocacy, Lady Worcester has campaigned against Britain's membership of the EU and in support of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Celebrity: TV star Dominic West also joined the campaign against the gigantic farm in Derbyshire . Home: Lady Worcester has previously lobbied spectators at the Badminton Horse Trials, held at her family's ancestral home of Badminton House, pictured . Mr West, the star of acclaimed HBO drama The Wire, was a high-profile supporter of her campaign against the pig farm. 'The proposed factory farming of 25,000 pigs is an abomination,' he said. 'I hope MPP will not just set up somewhere else, so when we buy British we know we are not supporting this type of cruel and dangerous farming. 'The costs are much too high, from the superficial horrors of stench and stressed, unhealthy animals to antibiotic resistance that brings us closer to the end of antibiotics as a cure for human diseases. 'The world must move on, and we can all help by only buying pork from high welfare UK farms.' A spokesman for MPP said: 'The time taken by the Environment Agency to reach its conclusions has drawn out the entire process way beyond our initial estimates, something totally beyond our control. 'But we appreciate the pressure this has placed on the planning authorities and the lengthy period of uncertainty for local residents, both of which we feel could have been avoided. 'We believe that there should be a fundamental overhaul of the planning and permit application process to prevent such a long-winded situation from occurring again.'","Tracy Ward, Marchioness of Worcester, is a former TV actress who became a leading campaigner for animal rights .

"Married couples could get a bigger cut in income tax after the election, David Cameron has signalled as he admitted he must do more to win back disgruntled Tories. The Prime Minister said he wanted to 'expand' the marriage tax allowance, which begins next month and is worth £212-a-year for some couples. He said some of his natural supporters had 'drifted' to other parties, as he vowed to stick to his promise to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands', despite the number soaring to almost 300,000. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to expand the marriage tax allowance to win back disgruntled Tory supportersa . Under the Tory policy, 4million married couples are in line for the new tax break designed to support for stay-at-home parents. The £1,060 transferable tax allowance will particularly benefit couples where one parent does not work or only works part-time. However, if both people in a couple earn more than £10,600 they will not qualify and higher rate taxpayers earning more than £42,385 a year are also excluded. The idea was first promised by Mr Cameron when he ran for the Tory leadership in 2005, and marks the first recognition of marriage in the tax system since the married couples' allowance was phased out in 1999. It will apply to spouses who do not use all of their personal allowance – either because they are at home looking after children, or work part-time and earn less than the threshold for income tax, £10,600 in April. They will now be able to transfer up to £1,060 of their unused personal tax-free allowance to a spouse or civil partner, as long as the recipient of the transfer pays the basic rate of income tax, levied on income up to £42,385. That will save the couple up to £212 a year on their tax bill. At the Tory spring forum yesterday, Mr Cameron was heckled by party member Mike Howson who said the PM had 'betrayed this country on Europe and immigration' The Conservative Party will spend an extra GBP8 billion on the NHS if it wins the general election to fund a five year plan drawn up by its chief executive, Jeremy Hunt has promised. The Health Secretary said the Government would fully fund the plan drawn up by NHS England boss Simon Stevens, which would see £2billion being pumped into the health service every year until 2019-20. The so-called 'Stevens plan' will see a total of £30 billion put into the NHS, with £22 billion found through efficiency savings and £8 billion in extra spending. Until now only the Liberal Democrats had pledged to find the money but Mr Hunt has signed the Tories up to the plan. Asked by the Sunday Times if the Tories would find the full £30billion, Mr Hunt said: 'Yes. We've demonstrated that we're as good as our word. 'At the last election we were the only party that promised to protect the NHS budget. We didn't just protect it, we increased it. 'We said to Simon Stevens, 'How much do you need for your plan next year, the first year of your five-year plan?' He said '£1.7billion', and we actually found him £2billion. 'We're now doing the work as to what the efficiency savings are. The gap might be more than £8bn, it might be less. 'That will all be settled in the summer when we do the spending-round discussions. We will continue to spend more in real terms year in, year out.' However, the idea was mocked by Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who said the state should not lecture people on their private lives. 'We should not take a particular version of the family institution, such as the 1950s model of suit-wearing, bread-winning dad and aproned, home-making mother - and try and preserve it in aspic,' Mr Clegg said in 2011. 'That's why open society liberals and big society conservatives will take a different view on a tax break for marriage.' However, Mr Cameron has signalled that if he is returned to power he wants to increase the amount that married couples could save on their tax bills. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I am very proud to have kept my commitment to introduce the married couples' tax allowance. I think it will prove very popular. 'I think it's absolutely right that we recognise marriage in the tax system properly and I would like to see that expanded.' Mr Cameron suggested that it was part of attempts to win back traditional Tory voters who have switched to other parties, including Labour and Ukip. 'I accept I have a task in the next 41 days to win back people who are instinctively Conservative, who have strong Conservative values and some of them have drifted off to other parties. I need to win them back.' At the Tory spring forum yesterday, Mr Cameron was heckled by party member Mike Howson who said the PM had 'betrayed this country on Europe and immigration'. Mr Cameron has come under fire after promising 'no ifs, no buts' to cut net migration to below 100,000. But latest figures released last week show that a total of 298,000 more people arrived in Britain than left in the year to September, as the numbers arriving from the rest of the EU hit a record high. A record 624,000 arrived in Britain in a year, up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. At the same time, 327,000 left, a figure which has barely changed since 2010. Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . Some senior Tories urged Mr Cameron to ditch the pledge, but he has vowed to repeat it for the general election this year too. He said: 'Britain is facing quite a lot of pressure because the level of migration has been too high for too long. You see that on school places, and you see that in some places on the health service. 'I can absolutely say to people who are concerned about this, 'I hear you, I hear your concern, I get your message. He insisted he sticks to his pledge: 'you can call it an ambition, you can call it a target. That is what I want to achieve.'","Prime Minister suggests £212-a-year cut could be increased after election .

"A chance find in a  thrift store has awakened a whirlwind of emotions for one World War II veteran. Bill Moore, 90, was brought to tears recently when he read a long-lost love letter he sent his future-wife Bernadean Gibson 70 years ago, when he was a strapping young soldier, fighting with Patton's Third Army in Europe. The letter was discovered tucked inside an old record purchased at a thrift store by  Ilene Ortiz of Westminster, Colorado, who worked to reunite the letter with Moore's family. Scroll down for video . Memories: Bill Moore was brought to tears as he read a long-lost letter that he sent his future-wife Bernadean Gibson 70 years ago, while fighting in World War II . Surprise: The letter was discovered recently by a woman in Colorado who found the note tucked into a album case she bought a thrift store . Beautiful words: 'I have never been so homesick for anyone in all my life as I am for you,' the letter ends . 'When you're apart for that reason, not knowing if and when you'd ever see that person again, every chance you got to communicate was just wonderful,' Moore said of the letter. On the left, a picture of Bernadean from the time, and on the right, a picture of her future- husband in his uniform . The discovery took Moore completely by surprise, and he both cried and laughed as he read the flowery note to the girlfriend he met on furlough. 'My darling, lovable, alluring, Bernadean,' the letter reads. 'I ran out of space, but I could have written a lot more adjectives describing you. You are so lovely, darling, that I often wonder how it is possible that you are mine. I'm really the luckiest guy in the world, you know. And you are the reason, Bernadean. Even your name sounds lovely to me.' The letter dated 1945 was a preface to the Moore's 63 years of marriage, in which they raised three children. 'When you're apart for that reason, not knowing if and when you'd ever see that person again, every chance you got to communicate was just wonderful,' Moore told KMGH. However, it is also a painful reminder of Mrs Moore's passing. Bernadean died in 2010, and her husband currently lives in a care home for veterans. Meant to be: Moore sent the letter to is then-girlfriend Bernadean who he met on furlough. When he returned from war, the two got married and stayed together for 63 happy years of marriage. Bernadean died in 2010 . Today: Moore now lives in an assisted-living home for veterans. He says the letter was difficult to read because it's a reminder that Bernadean is no longer with him . 'It's difficult talking out loud about it to other people,' Moore said. 'But I loved her, and she loved me. That's all I can tell you. It’s a heartache not being with her all the time.' Last month, Ortiz spoke out about the search to find the rightful owner of the loving letter. Ortiz purchased the album at a local thrift store and later found the letter back at home - though she can't remember exactly which album the letter was hidden away in. Ortiz contacted ABC affiliate KMGH for help in finding the relatives of the subjects of the letter and together they located the deceased mother Bernadean and elderly father Bill's  daughter Melinda Gale, 48. Melinda Gale held back tears as she read the touching letter from her father to her mother 70 years ago. She told ABC she never could have imagined her father, a mechanical engineer, would use the flowery and loving language that he did. 'It's just when I get so horribly, terribly lonely for you that I write letters like this,' the letter continues. 'I have never been so homesick for anyone in my life as I am for you.' 'My hands were shaking when I finished reading it,' Gale said emotionally. 'It’s truly was a window into how deep their love was. And obviously, they were married for almost 63 years. We knew they loved each other very, very much, but as children you don’t see that. Where it came from, that deep connection, and this was a window into their story. He was a mechanical engineer. I cannot believe he shared these deep emotional words with her,' she shared. Gale and her history teacher sister always had a fascination with their father's experience in the war and in 2000 took a trip to Europe to retrace his steps. True loves: Bill and Bernadean Moore raised three children, now all grown . 'Mom had never gotten to see everywhere he had been. We did this amazing trip so I can picture exactly where he was on December 29 of 1944, sitting in this miserable, cold, dark forest in the northern region where France, Germany and Belgium all meet.' Gale told ABC she thinks her mother may have slipped the letter into the record for safe keeping because it was special to her. Even though Ortiz says she can't remember which record she found the letter in, Gale has her own theory. Gale explained that her mother and father's special song was 'I'll be seeing you,' from the Broadway musical Right This Way. Mom’s song for dad was ‘I’ll Be Seeing You,' she said. 'I’m sure it was in there.' 'What a sweet, wonderful Valentines gift to give our family,' Gale said. 'I didn’t get to meet this wonderful lady who found the letter, but I just can’t thank her enough.' Gales plans to give the letter to her father who lives in a veteran's assisted care facility.","Bill Moore, 90, sent the letter to his future-wife Bernadean Gibson in 1945 .

"A former finance chief and head of department at one of the Government's first free schools have been charged with fraud. Staff at Kings Science Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, were arrested on suspicion of fraud offences such as abusing their positions and false accounting last year. The school's founder, Sajid Raza, who gave David Cameron a guided tour of the academy after setting it up in 2011, was charged with a range of offences including fraud by false representation last week. Three staff members at Kings Science Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, have been charged with fraud offences. Among them is the school's founder Sajid Raza pictured giving David Cameron a tour of the school in 2012 . Today the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed Daud Khan, the school's former director of finance, and Shabana Hussain, a former head of department, would also face charges. All three will appear before Leeds Magistrates Court at a date yet to be fixed. Their arrests came after an investigation by the Education Funding Agency which found that more than £86,000 of funds given to the school had 'not been used for its intended purpose'. Claims included reimbursements for First Class plane tickets, furniture and parties, the report found. 'Having carefully considered all of the evidence presented to us, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence to charge Daud Khan (former director of finance) and Shabana Hussain (former head of department) with a range of offences relating to their involvement with the Kings Science Academy, Bradford, and that it is in the public interest to do so,' Julian Briggs, from CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said. 'Accordingly, I have today authorised West Yorkshire Police to charge Daud Khan with two offences of fraud by abuse of position and three of false accounting, and Shabana Hussain with one offence of fraud by abuse of position and one offence of acquiring criminal property. An Education Funding Agency investigation claimed the school spent more than £86,000 of taxpayers' money on items that were not 'the intended use' Following Raza's arrest in 2014 the Liberal Democrat MP for Bradford East, David Ward, put pressure on the then Education Secretary Michael Gove to address the fact taxpayers' money had been poured into the allegedly corrupt school. He declined to speak about the matter in the House of Commons, telling politicians he did not want to influence any police activity. Kings Science Academy was among the first free schools to be set up by the coalition in 2011. A year after its completion the Prime Minister visited the site to speak with pupils. He was photographed being shown around the grounds by Raza, 41. Last week he was charged with three offences of fraud by abuse of position, three offences of false accounting, two offences of obtaining a money transfer by deception, and one offence of fraud by false representation.

"Three children from a remote mountain village in China travel on horseback for three hours a day in order to attend their nearest school. The eight-year-olds endure the 16km round trip every day accompanied by their elderly grandparents - who walk for six hours a day to ensure their grandchildren get the education they themselves were denied. The grandparents of Huang Shijun, Huang Chenbin and Huang Lingyan  take the children from their remote home in Mudong village to school every day on horseback, leading the animals along the muddy, rocky and winding track 1,300m above sea level. The grandparents take it in turns to lead the horses along the trail, which is 1,300 metres above sea level . The journey can be dangerous, particularly when it is icy - then the children have to stay at home . The children, all from the Yao ethnic minority group, are all 'left-behind children' - which means their parents have left them in the care of their grandparents while they look for work in towns and cities miles from their village homes. The People's Daily Online reports the youngsters have ridden the horses along the muddy and often dangerous road to school for the last three years. All three youngsters are in Grade One at Liuli elementary school. Huang Shijun, Huang Chenbin and Huang Lingyan are all aged just eight - and travel 16km a day to school . Huang Lingyan (left) said she loves going to school by horse - and all her friends are jealous of her transport . The muddy road from Mudong to Liuli village was only built in 2010, supported by government grants and cannot carry cars. The school has just one teacher, who has worked there alone for five years, teaching two classes with 19 students in total. Huang Fengjun, Huang Chenbin's 60-year-old grandfather, has been using a horse to carry his grandson to school since Huang Chenbin started preschool three years ago. He said the three families had three horses and use them to carry their children to school. During busy seasons for farmers one elderly person takes all three children to school on behalf of the three families. The children often get soaked through on their daily excursions as they cannot carry umbrellas when it rains . After arriving at school, the horses are tied in front of the school's field to graze and the elderly people return to their village. At 3pm the grandparents walk back to the school to take the children home. According to Huang Fengjun, their horses are very docile and do not run around or kick people. But at the beginning of March one horse ran into the mountains and disappeared. Now the three children have to share two horses to get to school. The children often get soaked through on their daily excursions as they cannot carry umbrellas when it rains. Huang Fengjun said: 'Rain will wet their clothes and shoes, so we use plastic sheets to cover the kids and then take them slowly on the horses to school.' But when the weather takes a turn for the worst and the mountain pass freezes it becomes too slippery and dangerous to travel on. When that happens the children are forced to stay at home. The school has just one teacher, who works there alone, teaching two classes with 19 pupils . Huang Lingyan's grandmother said that Huang (pictured) is clever, sensible and studious . The tiny school has just one teacher and two classes -  eight-year-old Huang Lingyan came first in her class . Huang Fengjun said: 'We all hope that they study hard and become promising in the future. 'We hope that they can leave the mountains to see the outside world as soon as possible.' At Huang Lingyan's home, there are many certificates of merit on the wall. Huang Lingyan, a straight-A student, came first in her class following an exam last term. Meng Binghua, Huang Lingyan's grandmother, said Huang is 'clever, sensible and studious'. But she added that her granddaughter often asks her questions about her homework - questions illiterate Meng Binghua cannot answer. She said:  'I am an illiterate. What can I do? I feel sad every time  I am asked by my granddaughter for help with her homework. 'Life in the mountain is very hard for an illiterate. I want to send her to school for further study in the future, no matter how hard and tired I become.' Huang Fengji, her grandfather, said: 'Basically, I cannot do other work as long as I need to send her to school. 'I pray that she arrives at school safely without any accident every day. I hope that my granddaughter will be accepted by a good school to win honour for our family.' Huang Lingyan said: 'I like going to school by horse, all my friends are very jealous and want to have a horse as well. 'Sometimes we let them have a ride, when there is time. My horse is also my friend as well.'","Children from remote village in China must travel 16km to nearest school .

"If you've ever given blood, you'll know that even the most skilled nurses and doctors can struggle to locate the vein first time. So hospitals in the US are trialling a device that can locate veins inside a person’s arm using harmless near-infrared light. Called Christie VeinViewer, the device detects veins and then projects the image of them in real-time on top of the arm to help the medical worker know where to put the needle. Scroll down for video . A Memphis-based company has released a system to observe veins. Called VeinViewer (shown) it uses infrared light to look 'under' the skin. It can then project a high-definition image of the veins onto the surface of the skin. The device enables doctors and nurses to find a vein immediately . The medical system was designed by Memphis-based company Christie Medical Holdings. It shows a picture of your veins directly on your skin’s surface, ‘hopefully saving you from the unnecessary pain of multiple needle stings,’ said the company. The device attaches to a movable arm that can be wheeled into position, to keep it steady while observing a patient’s arm. It works by emitting near-infrared light, which is absorbed by hemoglobin in the blood and then reflected by surrounding tissue. The information is processed digitally by the unit, and projected in real-time onto the skin. VeinViewer works by emitting near-infrared light, which is absorbed by hemoglobin in the blood and then reflected by surrounding tissue. The information is processed digitally by the unit and projected in real-time onto the skin. It can see patterns up to 0.6 inches (15mm deep), and veins up to 0.4 inches (10mm) deep .

This can allow a clinician to find turns in a person's veins, called bifurcations, and valves. The user can also take up to 200 static images of patient vasculature - the arrangement of blood vessels in the body. ‘Only VeinViewer can provide pre, during and post-access benefits throughout the entire vascular access procedure,’ said Christie’s president, George Pinho. ‘It is also the only device of its kind that has been shown through clinical studies to increase both first-stick success and patient satisfaction by up to 100 per cent while reducing medically unnecessary [catheter] lines by over 30 percent.’ A fine detail mode also increases the contrast in the image, bringing out more detailed vein formations.

It weighs 309lb (140kg) with extending legs that stop the 'bear' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms.

"Today show host Matt Lauer has finally exacted his revenge on Ellen DeGeneres by filling her car with 20,000 ping pong balls after weeks of being hilariously pranked by the comedian. The 57-year-old journalist shared a video montage of Ellen's past tricks, which included a spoof video which made it look as though Matt had interviewed the stars of Fifty Shades of Grey while wearing a leather harness and not much else, before showing his act of retaliation. 'I vowed I would get revenge, and the moment has finally arrived,' Matt said this morning on the show. Epic prank: Ellen DeGeneres used FaceTime to show Matt Lauer the damage he had done after he had her Porsche filled with 20,000 ping pong balls as a joke . Huge mess: When the 57-year-old opened the door to her car, thousands of ping pong balls came streaming out . Matt explained that he and his colleagues have been the targets of several of Ellen's pranks in the past few weeks, before noting that it all 'ends today'. He then showed some footage of the Today crew filling Ellen's black Porsche Cayenne with 20,000 ping pong balls which had pictures of him posed with Ellen printed on them, while she filmed an episode of her talk show inside. Matt even had the crew place a life-size cardboard cut-out of himself in one of the front seats, so that Ellen would have no doubt about who was responsible for the mischievous prank. They also changed her license plate to read 'Lotta Balls'. In shock: Ellen was in disbelief when she first saw her car that was stuffed to the brim . Next step: She didn't know what else to do except open the door to her car and lets the ping pong balls out . When Ellen walked into the parking lot and saw her car, she yelled: 'Seriously? I mean seriously.' She opened the door of her car and thousands of ping pong balls spilled out, revealing Matt’s cardboard cut-out. 'I'll get you Matt Lauer,' she continued. 'Damn you Lauer! He is littering. This is against the law. Ellen went on to search for the camera that was capturing the hilarious moment. 'You think you can just do this?’ she asked. ‘Uh-uh.' Someone eventually brought Ellen and iPad so she could FaceTime Matt. Act of revenge: While she tried to clean out her car, Ellen vowed to get Matt back for his trick . Starting to worry: While talking to Matt on FaceTime, Ellen told him that her previous pranks were just fun and games. 'Now it's on Lauer,' she warned him . 'Have you seen this?’ she asked him. She added: 'Oh, I am great. We were just about to start a beer pong tournament, so I needed like 20,000 ping pong balls, so the jokes on you Lauer.’ 'You have to admit Ellen; it took a lot of balls to pull off this prank,' Matt replied. Ellen revealed that she had already filmed another spoof video starring Matt that very day and suggested that he watch her show. 'I can't watch the show tomorrow because I am entering the witness protection program in the morning,' he joked. 'Can I just end by telling you the obvious? I adore you.' Buckle up: Ellen tried to get into her car despite it still being filled with thousands of ping pong balls . All ready: She managed to close the door, but she knew that there was no way she could drive her Porsche home in this condition . More fun: Ellen then opted to jump out of the car and swim into the pile of ping pong balls that had fallen out . And while Ellen said that she adored him as well, she warned him that he has raised the stakes – and hinted that he should prepare himself for an impressive round of retaliatory revenge pranks. 'Before it was fun and games. It was jokes,' she said. 'Now it is on Lauer.' Ellen tried to get into her car and drive home, but quickly realized it was impossible, and instead opted to abandon her attempt in favour of swimming through the ping pong balls that surrounded her car in the parking lot. Back in the studio, Matt revealed he was having second thoughts about pulling a joke on the master prankster. Making plans: The Today show crew can be seen filling Ellen's car while she was in the Warner Bros. studios taping her talk show . Personal touch: The ping pong balls even featured a small picture of Matt and Ellen on them . 'You know the definition of a nano second?’ he asked his co-hosts. 'It is the period of time between feeling good about getting her back and fearing for your life.' Savannah Guthrie noted: ' I thought it was on before.' 'That was supposed to be closure for you,' Carson Daly added. And to prove that his prank was all in good fun, Matt revealed that he never intended to leave Ellen stranded. The feud continued: Even before she knew about Matt's prank, Ellen had another trick up her sleeve. Her latest spoof video made it look like 81-year-old Florence Henderson was tearing off his close on the Today show . Sultry interview: Matt can bee seen laughing as he watched Florence Henderson ask 'him' if they could be friends with benefits . Funny moment: At one point during the striptease, Ellen made it look like Florence's bra was flung onto Al Roker's head . He had both a car service and a clean-up crew waiting nearby, so Ellen could get a ride home and her Porsche cleaned. During the segment, Matt and his co-hosts also showed a clip of Ellen's latest spoof video, which showed Matt and 81-year-old actress Florence Henderson tearing each other's clothes off on the Today show. At one point a red bra was flung on to Al Roker's head. 'This is becoming a great feud,' Savannah said before asking Ellen to leave Matt's colleagues, including herself, out of it. But Al wanted to have a united front. 'You prank one of us, you prank all of us,' he said.","Ellen has carried out a number of her own pranks on Matt in the past few weeks .

"A married father of three used an alias on a dating app has been accused of raping a woman (above, Devin Richard Hartman) A married father of three who used an alias account on a dating app has been accused of raping a woman who he met while on a date. Devin Richard Hartman, 40, of Mableton, Georgia used the name 'Zach Anderson' on an OkCupid account, and met up in June with a 26-year-old woman who he met on the app. The woman reported having six beers while with him at a bar before later waking up on her doorstep without her keys, cell phone or underwear, and believes she was also drugged. An exam conducted the day after they met determined she had been sexually assaulted, and Hartman was charged with rape and aggravated sodomy on Monday.

"As more places legalise marijuana, scientists are warning of the potential health risks of eating cannabis-infused snacks. With smoking, the peak blood levels happen within 3-10 minutes, and with eating, it's 1-3 hours, making it easier to overdose on food-related cannabis products. Now experts are warning that legalised marijuana needs to have strong restrictions on the drug's edible products, which are often packaged to appeal to children. Scroll down for video . As more places legalise marijuana, scientists are warning of the potential health risks of eating cannabis-infused snacks.With smoking, the peak blood levels happen within 3-10 minutes, and with eating, it's 1-3 hours, making it easier to overdose on food-related cannabis products . The problem is that marijuana edibles – which often look like candy or cookies and are frequently potent – increase the chances that children will overdose, they say. 'As legalisation of marijuana spreads, new adopters should ensure that their regulatory scheme for marijuana edibles is fully baked,' wrote Robert MacCoun and Michelle Mello of Stanford Law School. Marijuana use for adults over 21 is fully legal in Colorado, Washington and Alaska. Oregon passed a similar law that will take effect in July. Several other states have legalised marijuana for medicinal use or have decriminalised it. A notable feature of state-legalised retail sales of marijuana has been the popularity of edibles. The problem is that marijuana edibles – which often look like candy or cookies and are frequently potent – increase the chances that children will overdose, they say.' As legalisation of marijuana spreads, new adopters should ensure that their regulatory scheme for marijuana edibles is fully baked,' the Stanford experts warned . Professor MacCoun explained that the original marijuana laws 'were not rigorous and detailed in their approach to issues like edibles, . Colorado and Washington put extremely modest rules on edibles, therefore making it easy to sell and market edible products, he said. 'Both states require child-resistant packaging, a warning to 'keep out of the reach of children,' and labelling describing a standard serving size,' wrote MacCoun and Mello . 'Neither requires warnings that ingested marijuana can have different effects from smoked marijuana.' Some of the edibles look like Hershey or KitKat bars, and the drinks resemble the major brands of non-marijuana colas. Motor neurons (pictured) are nerve cells found in the cerebral cortex of the brain stem, and are responsible for giving orders to muscles . Marijuana users can sometimes have difficulty speaking, breathing and swallowing food as a result of muscle weakness. Now researchers in Spain have conducted a landmark study to shed light on how marijuana reduces the activity of motor neurons that lead to these symptoms. Motor neurons are nerve cells found in the cerebral cortex of the brain stem, and are responsible for giving orders to muscles in the body. Researchers at the University of Cadiz, led by Professor Bernardo Moreno, used synthetic analogues of the psychoactive compounds of marijuana to see how they affected these neurons. They looked, in particular, at movements of the tongue and how they responded to the drug. 'During the investigation, we used an animal model in which we studied the alterations produced by synthetic cannabinoids on the activity of the motor neurons,' the researchers wrote. 'In doing so, we discovered that these psychoactive compounds inhibit the information that reaches these neurons via the synapses. 'In other words, cannabinoids hinder the transmission of information between neurons.' All of this could lead to problems speaking, breathing and swallowing food. 'It evokes tobacco companies' use of advertising campaigns with youth appeal,' MacCoun and Mello wrote. They acknowledge that marijuana is associated with a long history of 'public misinformation' about the effects of the drug. But the scientific record is clear on the documented risk of edibles, especially for children. 'Some of these products contain four or more times the level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that is considered to be a safe dose,' they noted. Taken in large doses, THC can produce serious anxiety attacks and psychotic-like symptoms, according to MacCoun and Mello. And strong differences exist in the effects of marijuana when it is eaten rather than smoked. Case reports document respiratory insufficiency in young children who have ingested marijuana through edibles, MacCoun said. A recent study showed that the proportion of ingestion-related emergency department visits by children in Colorado associated with marijuana ingestion increased after legal restrictions were eased. The majority of identified sources in those cases were marijuana edibles.","It takes longer feel impact of eating marijuana compared with smoking .

"It's a dog's life, but for canines in the Northern Territory things started to look up after a monster crocodile was caught that had been eating dogs in the local area. The NT News reported that a 4.38 metre croc that had been eating dogs and threatening locals in a Daly River community was finally caught and removed on Saturday. The Parks and Wildlife Crocodile Management team trapped the creature near Nauiyu and successfully removed him. Senior ranger Tom Nichols said the animal had been in the area for ‘a couple of weeks’. The Parks and Wildlife Crocodile Management load the 4.38m crocodile onto a trailer . ‘It was taking dogs from the community and posing a threat to kids in the area,’ he told the NT Times. ‘A trap was set about a week ago and croc was caught on Thursday.’ It took three members of the croc management team and local police to get the half-ton saltie out of the trap. ‘We gave it some drugs, pulled it out of the trap and loaded it up on our skid trailer,’ Mr Nichols said. ‘Some crocs are worse than others but he wasn’t too bad.' The huge crocodile's jaws are taped shut before it is pulled from the trap up to the trailer . ‘We stopped in Adelaide River to wet him down and that gave the local kids, and adults too, a chance to see the croc and ask questions.’ This was the 58th crocodile removed from Top End waters this year. It was later taken to the Darwin Crocodile Farm at Noonamah.","Parks and Wildlife Crocodile Management team trapped it near Nauiyu .

"A high school has been caught out editing photos of its students to rid them of piercings, acne, freckles and even one boy's monobrow and moustache. Students and parents at Daylesford Secondary College in Victoria were left outraged when they saw their 2015 school photos last week. Year 10 students Jacki Lipplegoes and Annemieke Visser both had nose piercings edited out without warning and claim the shape of their noses was changed in the process. Their 15-year-old classmate, Ethan Brown, had his eyebrows edited to remove his monobrow. Ethan Brown, who is in year 10 at Daylesford Secondary College in Victoria, had his eyebrows edited (right) to remove his monobrow in his school photo . 'I pulled my photo from the folder and saw there was something wrong with my nose. I was really confused. One of my friends noticed they had photoshopped my piercing out,' Jacki told Daily Mail Australia. 'Everyone in my school who had piercings had them blurred out... but we were never told to take them out, there was no warning.' 'It didn't look like me... I was really angry and disappointed. Principal Graeme Holmes  admitted the school's approach to removing piercings was wrong and they will offer students the original photos at no cost. 'Anyone with piercings was photoshopped but they also did freckles too,' Jacki said. 'Someone had his monobrow and moustache photoshopped  - that's a completely different story... (facial hair) is natural. 'It's like they were trying to make the perfect teenager.' Ethan's grandmother said he was left feeling 'very disappointed' when he realised his eyebrows had been edited in his school photo. Year 10 students at Daylesford Secondary College in Victoria, Jacki Lipplegoes (left) and Annemieke Visser (right), say their school photos were edited to rid them of their nose piercings . Jacki Lipplegoes, 15, says her nose ring was photoshopped out and altered her nose in the process . Annemieke Visser was wearing a nose stud as per school policy, but it was still edited out anyway . Mr Holmes said the edits were made because of school policy. 'I acknowledge that we took the wrong approach in photoshopping piercings out of our school photos and I can assure the school community that this will not happen again,' he said. 'We do allow our students to have facial piercings - however, due to safety reasons, those piercings may only be studs, and cannot include rings, sleepers or hoops.' But 15-year-old Annemieke Visser says she did have a stud in and it was blurred anyway. 'My nose ring was photoshopped and my face was airbrushed. My nose isn't the same - there's brown marks near it,' she said. Year 10 students Jacki Lipplegoes (left) and Annemieke Visser (right) both had nose piercings edited out without warning and claim the shape of their noses was changed in the process . 'We've always been told no rings, but I have a stud. I've never been told to take it out and I'm still wearing it today. 'It kind of felt like they didn't like your image so they had to change it. It's sad to think a school needs to alter appearances.' Mr Holmes said students would be offered the original portraits to those who wanted to exchange their photos. 'Next year, we will ensure that students have plenty of notice that they will only be able to participate in school photos if they meet our uniform policy,' he said.

"A financial advisor who swindled £5million from his elderly victims has been ordered to pay back just £1. Terry Warrington persuaded dozens of vulnerable people to part with their life savings, after spending 25 years running a successful investment company with his business partner. But the pensioners were left penniless when their investments were lost, and Warrington was jailed for four-and-a-half years in January 2014 after admitting fraudulent trading, theft and operating while unregulated. Terry Warrington (left) persuaded dozens of vulnerable people to part with their life savings, after spending 25 years running a successful investment company with Malcolm Barber (right) At a proceeds of crime hearing hearing at Preston Crown Court, Warrington, who has now declared himself bankrupt, was made to pay back just £1, despite benefiting from more than £5million. An elderly couple from Morecambe, Lancashire, who lost over £100,000 after investing on the advice of Warrington, said: 'That money was to help the family and give us something to fall back on and that worries us more than anything.' A couple from Heysham, Lancashire, who invested £30,000 following advice from Warrington, said: 'Terry came to our house three times and told us he was having a bit of trouble raising the cash, but he would pay it out of his own pocket. We are still waiting.' For almost 25 years, Warrington and his colleague Malcolm Barber ran an investment company offering fixed bonds and loans to hundreds of investors. At a proceeds of crime hearing hearing at Preston Crown Court (pictured), Warrington, who has now declared himself bankrupt, was made to pay back just £1, despite benefiting from more than £5million . But in April 2007, the scam was uncovered and the business partners were jailed following a lengthy investigation. They were both banned from being company directors for five years. An investigation will now be launched into all Malcolm Barber's assets, to determine how to meet the £5.7million payback. All the money eventually recouped will be paid back proportionately to the victims. A further hearing will take place in September once investigators have analysed Barber's assets. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'Should Terry Warrington come into any money in the future, that will be confiscated.'","Terry Warrington persuaded dozens of victims to part with life savings .

"Britain's most dangerous roads are in Lincolnshire, a new report has revealed. The county was named as the place where more drivers, passengers and pedestrians were killed  than anywhere else in the country. The study also found that residents living in rural communities nationally were more likely to be 'killed or seriously injured' on the roads. This is because vehicles travel faster and there are fewer traffic calming measures, according to the research carried out by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTs) and Direct Line Car Insurance. Grimsby, pictured, had the highest road casualty rate on roads in Britain, according to a new study . This is compared to more urban areas where casualty rates were well below the national average. The report calculated the casualty rates for residents of each parliamentary constituency. Those in the North and East of England had the highest  in Britain, with both Lincolnshire and Lancashire having three constituencies each in the top ten. It concluded that Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire, had the highest road casualty rate in Britain. The town's casualty figures were 53 per cent higher her than the national average. Banff and Buchan in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, had the highest number of people killed or seriously injured, with figures 111 per cent above the national average. By contrast, South Wales had the lowest rates for  casualties killed or seriously injured. Four Cardiff constituencies, along with Torfaen and Newport West, ranked in the bottom 10. In 2013 a total of 183,670 people were reported injured on British roads, including 23,370 killed or seriously injured, at a cost to society of £15 billion. There are three main factors affecting deaths and serious injury on the roads, the report said. The first is the driver's behaviour, including speeding, drink and drug driving, non-use of seat-belts and use of mobiles behind the wheel. Grimsby's casualty figures were 53 per cent higher than the national average. Pictured: Grimsby . The second is the safety quality of the road network itself and the vehicles using it, and the third is the quality of emergency medical system and trauma care in that particular region. David Davies, Executive Director of PACTS said: 'Road collisions remain a major cause of death and serious injury in Britain. 'Traffic danger has a significant negative influence on society, it discourages people from walking or cycling, restricts the freedom of children and means vulnerable road users feel intimidated. 'Despite great improvements in emergency services and trauma care, thousands of victims of road collisions are left with life-changing injuries while the families of casualties also find their lives changed forever.' Mike Holliday-Williams, Managing Director Personal Lines at Direct Line added: 'Good information is an essential basis for effective road safety action. 'Now, for the first time, MPs have specific road casualty information based on their constituency boundaries and its residents. 'We hope the Road Safety Dashboard will provide a catalyst for action aimed at reducing deaths and injury at a local level, as the diversity of results demonstrate there is a no 'one size fits all' solution . 'The Dashboard will become a vital tool in helping improve the safety of Britain's roads.","Study finds Britain's most dangerous roads are in Lincolnshire .

"Police in Oakland, California, say they have found no evidence to link murder suspect Robert Durst to the 1997 disappearance of Charlotte teenager Kristen Modafferi. Durst, the subject of HBO's documentary series The Jinx, was arrested last weekend and was charged on Monday by L.A. officials in connection with the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. In the wake of Durst's arrest, Oakland police revealed that they and the FBI were looking into the possiblility that he was somehow involved in Modafferi's disappearance. Scroll down for video . Police in Oakland, California, say they have found no evidence to link murder suspect Robert Durst to the 1997 disappearance of Charlotte teenager Kristen Modafferi . The 18-year-old student from North Carolina had gone missing after finishing work in San Francisco on June 23, 1997. Durst was rumored to be living in the area around that time, reports The Wrap. 'The Oakland Police Department conducted an investigation with the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the 1997 disappearance of Kristen Modafferi,' said the police in a statement on Thursday. 'The investigation was open and active for several years. At this time we do not have any evidence that indicates Robert Durst was involved in her disappearance.' Police in Eureka, California, do however remain interested in Durst in connection with another missing persons case. Karen Mitchell, 16, was last seen on November 25, 1997 after leaving her aunt's Eureka home. Robert Durst grinned as he was transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on Tuesday . Eureka police said on Tuesday they would like to speak to Durst about his possible connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997 . Durst had reportedly visited the aunt's store dressed in drag. Investigative journalist Matt Birkbeck said on CNN this week that Durst frequented a homeless shelter where Mitchell volunteered, and he drove a car matching the description of one seen near the location where the girl vanished. Durst's arrest in New Orleans came the day before the finale of HBO series, The Jinx, about his links to the three killings. On the final episode, Durst made an apparent confession, saying in an unguarded moment: 'I killed them all, of course.' On Tuesday, Durst was transferred to a prison wing for the mentally ill in New Orleans while he awaits extradition to LA to face the first-degree murder charge. Questions also surfaced over his links to two missing California girls. The troubled real estate heir was moved to the acute mental health facility at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in Louisiana because he is considered a suicide risk, according to the sheriff's office on Wednesday. Durst has been charged with murder over the execution-style shooting of friend, Susan Berman, 15 years ago in LA. He also has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen McCormack, in New York. In 2003, Durst was acquitted of murder after he admitted to killing a neighbor in self-defense, dismembering him and throwing the body parts in Galveston Bay, Texas. He admitted that he had shot neighbor, Morris Black, in the defense but that his actions were self-defense. At the time, Durst was living as an odd and mute woman, named Dorothy Ciner. Durst's lawyer does not believe his client suffers from acute mental illness, according to a brief filed by the sheriff's office on Tuesday. A three-judge panel ruled that the sheriff has sole authority to decide where to house inmates needing mental health treatment.","Police in California say they have found no evidence to link murder suspect Robert Durst to the 1997 disappearance of  Kristen Modafferi .

"Scientologists hold a 'blackmail file' on John Travolta to stop him leaving the faith, which includes 'damaging material' from his sessions with auditors at the church, it has been claimed. A documentary investigating the religion and its secret California-based headquarters features a number of allegations about how members are threatened and tortured in prison-style camps and cut off from their family if they decide to leave Scientology. Others belonging to the most senior order of the faith have been forced to play musical chairs to the sound of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody in a fight to secure a chair to stay in the church, it was claimed. Scroll down for video . A documentary claims to have revealed secrets about the church of Scientology, including that members hold a blackmail file on John Travolta and others have been subjected to hard labour in 'prison camps' The allegations featured in 'Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief', a documentary shown on HBO in America on Sunday evening. The claims have been disputed by the Church of Scientology who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as 'admitted' liars and perjurers and 'professional anti-Scientologists.' Directed by Alex Gibney, Going Clear aimed to expose the secrets behind the mysterious faith followed by thousands of people including film stars John Travolta and Tom Cruise. It included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive claims about punishments endured by members and how followers have been manipulated. These included descriptions of a 'prison camp', revealed by former member Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor. People put into this camp are forced to do around  30 hours of hard labour, broken up by three hour rest breaks. Spanky was once the point of contact between the Church and Travolta and said she was sent to this 'prison camp', known as the Rehabilitation Project Force which, she claims, is where members are 'reindoctrinated.' The documentary also claimed Scientology chiefs hold a 'black PR package' on Travolta, with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions. During these sessions a trained auditor asked pointed questions such as 'What are you willing for me to talk to others about?' Travolta is said to have requested that his sessions were not filmed, but secret cameras were allegedly installed anyway. As well as the claims about Travolta, former senior members of the faith told documentary makers about the various forms of punishment meted out by leaders. The show claimed there is a 'black file' on John Travolta, which includes records of his auditing sessions . Senior members of Scientology, that are part of the higher Sea Org order, apparently are forced to play musical chairs to Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen to vie for a place in the church, as a form of punishment . Another form of punishment involved members of the highest ranking order within the Scientology church, Sea Org, whose members are said to be punished by being thrown in 'The Hole'. As well as beatings in 'The Hole', they are allegedly also subjected to demeaning tasks including mopping up the floor with their tongue to force t them to confess their crimes against the Church. Others are apparently ordered to play musical chairs to the sound of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody - fighting each other for chairs which allow them to remain in the church, with losers being expelled. Being expelled from the Church of Scientology comes at a high price, because all friends and family that are still with the religion are forced to cut any ties with departing members. Scientology is believed to be one of the reasons behind the breakdown of Tom Cruise's marriage to Katie Holmes because he was understood to have wanted to send their daughter Suri to Sea Org, according to reports at the time. In an interview with the New Yorker in 2012, Scientology spokesmen denied the claims. Tom Cruise allegedly worked with the Church of Scientology to wire tap former wife Nicole Kidman's phone . This strictest order of Scientology is run with rigid rules, with members being paid just $50 a week and being forced to leave if they have children. Members must pledge their allegiance to the faith for a billion years. It has also been claimed that the church helped Cruise find a new girlfriend when he opened a new site in Spain and was single. Officials are said to have found scientologist Nazanin Boniadi and had her braces removed, spent $20,000 on clothes and had her hair dyed to Cruise's liking, the Huffington Post reported.  The relationship soon ended. Former senior executive Mark 'Marty' Rathbun was also interviewed for the documentary and made claims about the church's tax requirements. Rathbun was a senior aide to the current leader of the Church of Scientology, and alleged the church's goal was to be recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) in order to be made a fully tax-exempt religion, which it achieved in 1993. Members are said to have filed dozens of lawsuits against IRS and employed private investigators to dig for information in a bid to get the church recognized. Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor - once a member of the Church and the point of contact with John Travolta - described a prison camp where members would be forced to work 30-hour shifts, with around three hours of breaks . Another senior former member interviewed was Paul Haggis, a former director of the church. He said  once members reached a certain level they would see founder L. Ron Hubbard's handwritten account of the creation myth. This states that Zenu, a galactic dictator froze people and dropped their bodies into volcanoes, 75 million years ago. These spirits are said to have jumped into the bodies of newborns and are now used as the explanation for the source of all of our anxieties and fears.  Hubbard is also said to have created 'Ethics' - a series of punishments for auditors who made mistakes. Mr Haggis left the church citing problems with its stance on gay rights, after his two gay daughters told him how they were being treated by members. The Academy Award winning filmmaker wrote an infamous resignation to Tommy Miscavage, Scientology's chairman and Hubbard's successor, saying he was disappointed that he had failed to denounce actions of a San Diego church against gay people. The documentary, based on a book by journalist Lawrence Wright, also claims that when the church thought Cruise was ‘slipping away’ during his marriage to Nicole Kidman, it worked with him to wiretap her phone, a claim that is flatly denied. In an interview with Business Insider Gibney said he took great steps to ensure that those who spoke out were not put into a compromising position and he ensured he never filmed them at their homes or arrived at a meeting point at the same time. He added: 'I often used throw-away phones and encrypted e-mail. People were so frightened.' The Church of Scientology, which is believed to have around 50,000 members, denied the allegations featured in Going Clear and said the statements included were 'entirely false.' Alex Gibney (left) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members and Paul Haggis (right) The documentary was screened in America on Sunday evening and is based on Lawrence Wright's book . In a statement it said: 'The Church has documented evidence that those featured in Gibney's film regurgitating their stale, discredited allegations are admitted perjurers, admitted liars and professional anti-Scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims. All have been gone so long from the Church they know nothing of it today. 'Yet Gibney and HBO stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the Church to offer relevant information about them, with more than 25 individuals with first-hand information eager to speak. To this day, neither HBO nor Gibney can deny that they have yet to present the Church with a single allegation from the film so the Church may have an opportunity to respond. The Church never sought special treatment, only fair treatment.' Since Going Clear premiered at the Sundance Festival in January, the church has created a website dedicated to criticising the film and released its own version, called 'Get the truth.' Representatives also branded the documentary a 'bigoted propaganda piece.' Other famous members have also criticised the show. Danny Masterton, a second generation Scientologist and former star of 'That 70s show', said he thought the book the documentary was based on was full of lies. He told eonline: 'I wonder if Sundance would allow a documentary of, like, eight people who hate Judaism. But you know, my religion's fair game, I guess, ""cause it's new"".' At the end of the documentary Gibney lists the people who refused to be interviewed, which included Miscavige, Travolta, Cruise and Kidman. MailOnline has contacted John Travolta for comment.","Going Clear documentary claims to reveal secrets of Scientology religion .

"Google's 'on-body detection'  users the phone's accelerometer to know when it's being moved and will only lock when placed on a flat surface . Google has already experimented with unlocking phones  using  faces, but for some this just isn't immediate enough. A number of Android owners have spotted a new feature that keeps the phone constantly unlocked as long as it's in a person's hand, resting on their leg or even just sitting in a pocket. The 'on-body detection' feature uses the phone's built-in accelerometer to know when it's being handled or moved, and will only lock the screen when placed on a flat surface. On-body detection was first spotted by  fan site Android Police in the Smart Lock menu of a Nexus 4 running Android Lollipop. But there have since been numerous reports of the phone appearing on other Lollipop devices, and not just Google's own Nexus range. It appears to be linked to the most recent version of Play Services -  a tool used to update Google's built-in apps. The on-body detection menu explained: 'The feature uses your device's accelerometer to detect whether your device is still being carried on the body. 'If your device detects that it's no longer being held, your device won't stay unlocked.' The phone has to be unlocked the first time it is picked up in the morning but once unlocked it will stay open until it is put on a table or similar. But as Google added, if the user unlocks their device and hands it to someone else the phone or tablet stays unlocked as long as the other person continues to carry it. It is also unclear how active the screen will be in a pocket. Google may shut down services but keep the screen unlocked, to avoid opening apps or accidentally calling people, known colloquially as 'butt dialling.' Google offers passwords and PINs to secure its phone, and more recently added Face Unlock (pictured) to phones  running Android Ice Cream Sandwich and above. It recognises a person’s face and can establish whether or not the face being shown to the camera is real, or is a photograph . These services may then be enabled once the phone detects it is in a person's hand. It is also not clear what impact having the screen constantly unlocked will have on battery life. MailOnline has contacted Google for more information. A combination of special hardware and software will be used to accurately verify it is you, not a picture of you or someone trying to impersonate you. The cameras use infrared technology to identify your face or iris and can recognize you in a variety of lighting conditions. These security features are opt-in, meaning that users will be able to still rely on passwords and PINs to unlock devices and features if they so desire.

"Imagine rolling out of bed into your train without even stepping outdoors. Now imagine that bed was in a uber luxurious bedroom suspended  in the rafters of a breathtaking penthouse, and with views over most of London. Sounds like a well-heeled city commuter's dream. That's the reality for businessman Arran Patel, the owner of this breathtaking apartment, built in the attic of the famous London landmark of St Pancras. With a ceiling more than 40ft high and three stepped levels connected by a staircase with glass balustrades, the property has lashings of wow factor. Inside Gothic St Pancras (left) is this modern penthouse (right): All the timber trusses and beams are original . The open plan lower floor has a relaxed kitchen, dining space and TV watching area. With the help of interior architect TG Studio, Patel, who lives between New York, London and South Africa, spent £300 per square foot on renovating the property - one of three penthouses in the 67 unit development. The master bedroom, which is located on the top floor, is open plan and can be closed to the triple-height living room by an electrically operated curtain. Patel describes the room as 'a self-contained hotel suite'. The master ensuite has a cave-like feel and is built using Portuguese Travertine stone.

All about the location: The property, owned by fisherman, Richard Lester, 79, sits in the exclusive Amagansett South enclave, where a home recently fetched $4million. Its new value, $1.2million,  is likely due to the Hamptons's popularity with celebrities and bankers . Another feature: In addition to a trailer, the site also features a blue-colored shed crammed with fishing gear and storage boxes . The property listing at Zillow.com is actually up $100,000 from a month ago. However, the plot originally listed for $1.6million when it hit the market in October. Situated just one mile away from the ritzy Indian Wells Beach, it is surrounded by the rich and famous, including Jerry Seinfeld and Paul McCartney. According to Douglas Elliman Real Estate, which has listed the site, it could easily be transformed into a 4,000sq ft house with a huge swimming pool. On its website, the real estate company tells potential buyers: 'You are not dreaming, this mobile home is over a third of an acre on a private third of an acre flag lot in Amagansett South. Just a mile away from Indian Wells Beach, south of the highway location adjacent to a home that just sold for $4M.' It adds: 'Use as is now, while you plan for your 4,000 square foot new house with 20 foot x 50 foot swimming pool.' Speaking to the New York Post, Mr Lester explained how he had moved the $15,000 wood-paneled trailer to the $300 land in the late 1950s. 'I had to work my a** off to get that,' said Mr Lester, who lives in the small property with his wife, Tess, and still works at sea. He added he was shocked by the site's new value, which is likely due to the Hamptons's popularity with celebrities and bankers.

When asked if he ever thought he would land 'the big one' in the property world, he replied: 'Not in God’s world. I think it’s ridiculous!' Listings agent Ray Lord, of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, said the price of the site is based solely on its exclusive, highly sought-after location. Indeed, the Hamptons is not only a desired location for wealthy homebuyers, but also a popular summer hot-spot for sociable multi-millionaires. There are now a handful of Hamptons owners who each year ask for more than a million dollars to rent out their pads for roughly two months. Neighbors: The site is surrounded by the rich and famous, including comedian Jerry Seinfeld (right) and singer Paul McCartney (left) Homes in the area come with the type of perks you would typically find at a five-star resort, including outdoor swimming pools and tennis courts.

Speaking of Mr Lester's on-sale land, trailer and shed, Mr Lord said: 'Erase the trailer from your mind and it’s $1million for land.' He added that all potential buyers so far have been builders. 'No one, I imagine, would build less than a three-bedroom, three-bathroom house,' he said.","Fisherman Richard Lester, 79, bought site for $300 in 1956 and later added modest one-bedroom trailer for $15,000 .

"Of all the terrible things a single mother has endured since discovering a malignant tumour in her breast, one of the worst was how to explain to her young daughter that she had cancer. Following her diagnosis in May 2014, 42-year-old City worker Ebba worried most about how six-year-old Lene would take the news. Her greatest fear was that Lene would be left without a mother at a young age, just like her own mother had been. Ebba's grandmother had died of liver cancer when Ebba's mother was only 10. Ebba is proud of how daughter Lene, six, has dealt with her breast cancer diagnosis . Ebba, who is originally from Germany and now lives in London, said: 'When I was first diagnosed, I had all the shock, horror and anxiety to deal with and I worried history would repeat itself. 'My grandmother died of liver cancer when she was 33 and my mother was 10. I was told she was in horrific pain and that has always informed my image of cancer.' After finding a lump in her breast, Ebba waited until she had confirmation that it was cancer following a number of tests before broaching the subject with her daughter one bedtime. 'I thought it would be the worst thing ever to tell Lene and I was worried I would dissolve into tears,' she told MailOnline. 'But I forgot that children don't have the same images of people being bald and throwing up. 'Beforehand I was very stressed and tearful at the thought of having to tell Lene but when it happened she was calm. 'She'd never heard of cancer before so her first response was to be puzzled. I didn't get the reaction I'd had from other people that something terrible was happening to me so in the end it was one of the few occasions I didn't cry when telling someone I had cancer.' Mother and daughter pictured after one of Ebba's chemo sessions when she started to lose her hair . Ebba tried to make her hairloss fun for her daughter so it was less traumatic for them both . Since her diagnosis, Ebba and Lena have found 'The Clouds toolkit' a useful resource to help them through the incredibly difficult time. Created by the Fruit Fly Collective using money raised through Red Nose Day, the resource pack provides invaluable guidance to parents on how to talk to their children about what cancer is and the treatments and side-effects involved. Designed by psychotherapists and artists, it includes puppets, photos and illustrations which help families share their emotions and gain a greater understanding of what lies ahead. As Ebba explains, children often need reassurance about issues that adults wouldn't usually consider - like whether cancer is contagious - and are most alarmed by the hair loss caused by chemotherapy. 'When we initially talked about it, Lene was most concerned about hair loss, I still remember her eyes looking big and shocked when I told her my hair would fall out,' Ebba said. 'She was also worried about catching cancer and I found her looking for lumps.' When Ebba did start to lose her hair, she found a way to make it less traumatic for Lene. She said: 'They say it's good to take control before it starts so I looked online for nice head scarves and in a funny way I was looking forward to wearing them. 'It meant that when it happened it was a big event but not too traumatic for me. But Lene found my hair loss very tough to deal with, very disconcerting. Ebba wearing a scarf, left, and wig, right, her daughter helped her choose following her chemo . 'I'd decided I was going to shave my hair off so we had a little party and my daughter cut my hair. I invited a few friends and we had drinks and biscuits. Lene took the scissors and then everyone else got involved.' Thanks to eight gruelling chemotherapy cycles, two operations, and forthcoming radio therapy, Ebba is getting better and hopes to make a full recovery. She said: 'Now from what they can see it looks like the primary cancer is gone and I should be cancer free. But it's hard to say I'm cured because some of the cancer cells may have survived and escaped into the rest of my body so I'll have annual check-ups and hope for the best.' Ebba said it's been a difficult time for both her and Lene but she has felt proud of the way her daughter has adapted and coped. She said: 'I'm amazed at how calm Lene has been all the way through. When I had my first cycle we were all very scared and she papered my bedroom with get well cards. 'She has always tried to cheer me up and encouraged me to look nice. She pressed me to get a wig, to put on a nice dress and make-up so I would feel better. 'She reads to me and when I've been really sick and tired she sits next to me and draws very quietly instead of jumping across the furniture like she normally would. 'Like most mothers, the thought of dying and leaving my daughter is really hard to deal with. But one thing I've learned through all this is that she is extremely adaptable and would be okay.' The Clouds toolkit, pictured, gives parents with cancer information on how to support their children . For any other parents who find themselves in the same terrible situation, Ebba has the following advice: 'I think it's really important to let children get involved and have an active role as much as they can. 'All of the things Lene has done have made her feel part of things. Just like adults, if children feel included and are able do something to help it gives them an important feeling of having some control over their situation.' She added: 'I think being honest is also really important. Children already know when something is up, they sense the emotional temperature and see the hugs and furtive conversations so you can't lie to them, especially if they are older child as they might get upset when they find out. You don't want to fall apart in front of them but don't totally hide what you're feeling either, let them be part of your journey.' She also recommends the The Clouds resource pack which is available via www.fruitflycollective.com. Ebba said: 'It was really brilliant. From a kid's perspective it's like a treasure box and it was nice to have something Lene could open and explore. 'It was a massive help to learn about things and I think it's really important to be honest with children because healthy communications help families get through cancer more easily. Lene kept her mother's spirits up with get well cards like this one she created . Lene wrote her experiences down in a book to hep her deal with them, like when she helped Ebba chose a wig . Lene's story, which she wants to sell to raise money, shows how they coped when Ebba's hair fell out . 'It was a great way to kick off the conversation. I gave this box to my child and she opened it. There were things for her to play with and it really helped to explain to her about the good and bad cells. 'It turned into a game and the whole thing was very relaxed, which is the beauty of it because it doesn't feel like a big deal. It's also been really useful to have something to refer back to when we've been talking about things later on.' One of the ideas suggested in the information pack was for Lene to write down her feelings. So she has created a storybook about her experiences called 'How It Is With Breast Cancer'. The selfless six-year-old wants to get the book published so she can support other children going through what she has experienced and give any money made from sales to charity.

"This is the moment that a Chinese man set up his own mini-kitchen in an airport departure lounge after missing his flight. Wu Jiayong, 46, became an internet hit after he produced the electric rice cooker from his luggage and made his own lunch in the middle of Hong Kong's busy International Airport. The 46-year-old was caught on camera collecting water from the airport's bathroom before plugging the rice cooker into one of the lounge's empty sockets, according to The People's Daily. Wu Jiayong, 46, became an internet sensation after he produced an electric rice cooker from his luggage and started to prepare his lunch in the middle of Hong Kong International Airport . The construction worker was flying home to Shandong, China, after losing his job in Singapore when he fell asleep and missed his connecting flight. 'I had just enough to get a new ticket set to leave on Tuesday two days later, but I didn't have any more money for food,' he said. 'I didn't want to offend anyone but I needed power supply to cook the rice so I had to do it indoors.' Eyewitnesses described the rice cooker as being 'hard to miss' with steam coming from it for over half an hour. After missing his flight the construction worker was left with no money for food and decided to make his own meals . Shocked eye witnesses took pictures after seeing the Mr Jiayong start cooking in the middle of the departure terminal . Mr Jiayong's mini kitchen was soon closed down by airport officials, but fellow travellers and stores within the terminal  helped him with food until he was able to fly home yesterday. He had been forced to travel to Singapore for work to help look after his family and used the rice cooker for preparing meals during his month long employment. Mr Jiayong was soon stopped from tapping into the airports electricity supply, but fellow travellers and terminal stores kept him fed after learning of his plight .","Wu Jiayong, 46, set up a mini-kitchen at Hong Kong International Airport .

"The house where Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza began his murderous gun rampage has been demolished. Councillors in Newtown, Connecticut, decided to knock down the large, picturesque house on Yogananda Drive, and tear apart its foundations, to stop it being a 'constant reminder' of Lanza's brutal 2012 massacre. Lanza, 20, gunned down his mother, Nancy, inside the home before moving on to the Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he murdered 20 first-graders and six members of staff. Demolition: Police watch as wrecking machinery finishes work on Yogananda Drive in Newtown, Connecticut, where Adam Lanza began the murderous Sandy Hook rampage by killing his own mother . Before: The 3,100-square-foot home was set in two acres of its own land in the exclusive town. Newtown authorities were given the house by the bank which acquired it, and voted to destroy it . Killer: Lanza, pictured above in two photos from some time before the 2012 killing, spent most of his time inside the house after dropping out of school . The killer spent most of his life at the home, which his parents bought in 1998 before they divorced. In the years leading up to the horrific shooting, Lanza spent increasing amounts of time inside its walls, where he spent hours playing video games, and would communicate with his mother by email. An exhaustive report into Lanza's life by state officials concluded that he was allowed to slip into a 'padded' world, in which he rarely had contact with the outside world - which may have contributed to the killings. No more: The home, pictured above four days after the December 2012 killing, had already been completely emptied and everything inside burned in the hope of preventing a trade in looted Sandy Hook memorabilia . Gone: Plans by the Newtown council call for the plot to be left empty and greenery planted there . Parents: Nancy Lanza, right, lived with her son in the home. Her ex-husband, Peter Lanza, left, lived in Newtown with them until he divorced Nancy . Lanza, who was on the autism spectrum and had other psychiatric problems, turned on his mother at the start of the December 14 rampage. He then drove to Sandy Hook and rampaged through classrooms, opening fire at young children and the teachers who tried to defend them. Lanza shot himself in the head just as police were arriving at the scene. Once the wreckage of the house, its driveway and foundations are removed, the space will be left empty. Demolition work began Monday, and the house has already been pulled down. Horror: Children are pictured above being led out of the school by their teachers on the day of the massacre . Aftermath: First responders are pictured above at the scene. Lanza shot himself in the head when police arrived . The town was given the 3,100-square-foot home, and its 2-acre lot, by a bank which acquired the property from the Lanzas. Bank officials had already gone inside and incinerated everything they could find, to stop any of the family's possessions becoming sick memorabilia of the massacre. The decision to rip down the house was made in late January, prompted in part by pleas from haunted neighbors. One, Dave Ackart, said: 'Not only is the property a constant reminder of the evil that resided there - those of us who walk, run, drive, ride or otherwise must pass it multiple times a day, are having a hard time moving on.' The plans call for the landscaped lot to be leveled later in spring, and new greenery planted.

"A drug dealer will be paid compensation by the Government for the injuries he suffered in a high speed crash, despite being found with cannabis on him to sell - after a ruling by judges at the Appeal Court. Sean Delaney, of Bedworth, Warwickshire, was left with long term disabilities and personality changes after the Mercedes he was in, driven by an acquaintance, crashed in 2006 near Nuneaton. Delaney, a father of four, had to be cut free from the wreckage of the crash by firefighters and a football sized portion of cannabis - worth around £1,000 - was found in his jacket. The Department of Transport had initially refused to pay Delaney any compensation because he was caught in a criminal act, namely the sale of cannabis. Senior judges at the Court of Appeal have ruled that the Government must pay costs and compensation, likely to run into millions, to a man severely injured in a car crash who had cannabis. Judges said a UK law that allowed insurers to refuse paying people involved in crime compensation contravenes an EU directive . However senior have ruled that the UK policy of refusing to compensate accident victims who have been knowingly involved in crime contravenes EU directives concerning motor insurance. They have ordered the Department of Transport to pick up the bill for the breach. The Government must now pay around £180,000 of Delaney's expected £250,000 costs as well as pay him compensation for his multiple injuries, a sum that is likely to run into millions because of the extent of his injuries. Delaney had 'gone for a spin' with his acquaintance, Shane Pickett, who lost control of the £80,000 Mercedes 500SL sports car at high speed after trying to overtake on a bend in November 2006. The car crashed into a Toyota people carrier. The Mercedes then ended up in a garden and hit a tree. Its roof and passenger door had to be cut off to remove Pickett and Delaney from the wreckage. Delaney suffered severe head injuries and brain damage with nine weeks loss of memory, and multiple fractures and internal injuries, and a changed personality. A fireman found a package of cannabis hidden in Pickett's sock and, when Delaney was pulled out of the car, a block of 240 grams of herbal cannabis fell from his bomber jacket. Pickett was jailed for 10 months at Warwick Crown Court in 2007 after admitting dangerous driving and possessing cannabis. Mr Justice Jay said: 'Readers might think: There must be a rule reflecting public revulsion which bars such a claim. There is not' However, no action was taken against Delaney. Delaney attempted to sue his friend for damages for his injuries, but his claim was thrown out by Judge Gregory at Coventry County Court in January 2011. His claim against car insurers Tradewise Insurance Services and the Motor Insurers Bureau after the policy was declared void, was also thrown out because the judge ruled that the car journey was for the collection and transportation of illegal drugs for subsequent re-sale and was a joint enterprise. The judge also ruled that his claim should be dismissed because he was engaged at the time together with Mr Pickett in conduct 'sufficiently anti-social that public policy prevents him from pursuing a claim arising out of it.' Delaney, who was a vocational tutor for students interested in mechanics, had sought a multi-million-pound award to pay for the lifetime of care he will need. Officials claimed they were covered by the 'crime exception' enforced by the Motor Insurers Bureau (MIB) bans insurance being paid to those who 'knew or ought to have known' that a vehicle in which they are travelling is being used 'in the course or furtherance of a crime'. In December 2011 three Appeal court judges dismissed Delaney's appeal saying he would, or should, have known the Mercedes was being used for 'the furtherance of crime'. However his solicitors then launched a claim against the Government for breach of the 2009 European Motor Insurance Directive which, in the interests of standardisation, allows no exclusions. It was claimed that the insurers' exclusion clause in UK law was incompatible with this European directive. Lawyers for Delaney claimed the breach was sufficiently serious that he was entitled to what is known as 'Frankovich' damages. Sitting at the High Court last year, Mr Justice Jay ruled that the crime exception conflicted with the European Motor Insurance Directive and the DfT should have ensured uniformity. The court found the illegality involved in the journey itself was merely 'scene setting' and not the cause of the accident. Mr Justice Jay said: 'I conclude with little hesitation that the DfT's breach is so serious that... it must pay compensation to Mr Delaney. The law is clear, the Department is in serious breach of it, and there must be judgment for Mr Delaney'. He added: 'Many readers may be wondering how it comes about that a drug dealer is entitled to compensation against Her Majesty's Government in circumstances where he was injured during the course of a criminal joint enterprise. 'The understandable reaction might be: there must be some rule of public policy, reflecting public revulsion, which bars such a claim'. But he concluded: 'The short answer is that there is not'. At the latest hearing at the Appeal Court, three senior judges unanimously rejected an appeal by the DfT. Lord Justice Richards, sitting with Lords Justice Kitchin and Sales, today ruled that Mr Justice Jay was right and dismissed the DfT's appeal. The DfT was refused permission to appeal further to the Supreme Court and was ordered to pay a £138,000 in interim costs. That is only a first instalment on Delaney's legal costs bills which are likely to exceed £250,000. The amount of damages now payable to Delaney has yet to be finally assessed but, given the severity of his injuries and the extent of care and support he will need in the future, it is likely to to run well into seven figures. Peter and Lisa Houston had been in the people carrier at the time of the crash, with their three children. All suffered serious injuries as well but were awarded only £20,000 between them.","Sean Delaney was travelling in Mercedes with his friend in November 2006 .

"She was the fastest vessel in the world's oceans and it seems the RMS Mauretania is still making waves - as a 12ft long model of the ship is set to sell for £50,000. The beautifully-crafted 1:64 scale model of the luxury British liner  was made to celebrate the actual ship's launch in 1906. The model will be auctioned in May - 100 years after Mauretania's ill-fated sister ship Lusitania was sunk by a German U-boat killing 1,198 passengers and crew. Scroll down for video . Set for auction: A beautifully crafted 100-year-old model of the RMS Mauretania is expected to fetch £50,000 at auction when sold in May . The actual ship: The vessel, once the fastest in the world, is seen in a photo taken from its sister ship RMS Lusitania before the First World War . RMS Mauretania held the record for the fastest Transatlantic voyage for 22 years until 1929, making it the world's fastest ship for almost a quarter of a century. She was built in 1906 after the cruise-liner company Cunard won a £2million loan from the Government to construct two vessels. RMS Mauretania made her maiden voyage the following year, setting off from Liverpool for New York on November 16, 1907. Weighing 31,938 tons, the ship had enough space for 563 1st class passengers, 464 in 2nd class and 1,138 in 3rd class. In 1909, just two years after its maiden voyage, RMS Mauretania obtained the Blue Riband title for the fastest eastbound and westbound journeys across the Atlantic. It held the title for 22 years until 1929 when it was surpassed by the German liner Bremen. As part of Cunard's original deal with the Government, the ship was made available to the Armed Forces during times of national emergency. So on August 4 1914 when Britain declared war on Germany, it was redirected from its path to New York and docked at Halifax to be named an armed cruise liner. The following week however the Mauretania and the Lusitania, its sister ship, were relieved of Government duties. She was docked at Liverpool with dwindling demand for transatlantic passages during the war until May 2015 when the Lusitania was sunk by Nazi torpedoes. Returned to service, the Mauretania was used to transport troops during the Gallipoli Campaign before being turned into a hospital ship. Later she was used to transport Canadian troops to France before being laid up on the Clyde until 1918. She resumed commercial passages in 1919, sailing from Southampton to New York via Cherbourg and in 1922 broke its pre-war transatlantic record for the fastest crossing, her average speed above 26 knots. In 1934 she made her final passenger voyage before being laid up in Glasgow following the merger of Cunard and White Star Lines. Now outdated and with the companies' required to reduce their fleet, she was sold for scrap the following year. The wooden replica was loaned by Swan Hunter, the company that built both ships for cruise line firm Cunard, to the Science Museum in London in 1938. The institution displayed it in their Shipping Gallery which was closed in 2012 and the model was removed and put into storage. It is still owned by Newcastle-based Swan Hunter but the company have decided to sell it. The model, which is 17in wide, 42in tall and weighs half a tonne, will be sold in London on May 12. London-based auctioneer Charles Miller said: 'The model is extremely decorative and detailed. It is one of the most glamorous models you will see. 'We are expecting interest from private collectors and museums in this. You can imagine it would make a great conversation piece in someone's home.' Cunard commissioned Swan Hunter to build the Lusitania and the Mauretania in response to the increasing threat of its domination of the Transatlantic passenger trade posed by the White Star Line, which went on to build the Titanic. The Mauretania held the prestigious Blue Riband title for the fastest Transatlantic voyage for 22 years until it was beaten 1929 by the German liner Bremen. A scale model of the Lusitania was also made but after the ship was torpedoed with the loss of 1,198 passengers in 1915 it was turned into a second miniature version of the Mauritania as it was thought it could have brought bad luck. That model still exists and its last known location was on board the QEII. The boat and model were both built by Swan Hunter, and the model was lent to London's Science Museum in 1938, where it stayed until 2012 . The 1:64 scale model of the ship was built by the Swan Hunter to commemorate ithe launch of the RMS Mauretania- which went on to break the record for the fastest sail across the Atlantic .

"Simon Danczuk has lambasted the Labour leader Ed Miliband . Ed Miliband is a 'f****** knob' who costs Labour votes, according to one of his own MPs. Outspoken backbencher Simon Danczuk said the Labour leader was seen as more of a 'toff' than David Cameron because he was too 'aloof' from voters' everyday lives. Ordinary people would rather go for a pint with the Prime Minister than the Labour leader - and any MP who said  otherwise was 'telling lies', Mr Danczuk said. He said: 'I spend four hours knocking on doors on a Sunday – they [constituents] say things like 'you're doing an alright job as MP but I don't want Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, so I won't vote for you'.' Mr Danczuk's bombshell remarks come just 45 days before the general election – and less than two weeks before the official campaign kicks off. The Labour backbencher tore into Mr Miliband for failing to connect with voters outside London and lambasted his decision to apologise for posing with a copy of the Sun newspaper. He said the public couldn't understand the Labour leader's decision to pose for a picture holding the Sun – while also claiming he had been right to apologise after the image sparked fury on Merseyside. Mr Danczuk said: 'It's that sort of double speak from politicians: How could he be right on both counts? That turns people off politics. 'So when somebody hears a politician say that, you know what they think, if you pardon the language: 'What a f****** knob'. That's the reality of it.' Mr Danczuk also blasted Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman for the same 'double speak'. The Labour backbencher said Mr Miliband was harming his chances of re-election. Mr Danczuk only won his seat by 889 votes in 2010, narrowly defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate Paul Rowen. Voters would prefer to go for a pint with the Prime Minister than the Labour leader - pictured in Scotland today - and any MP who said otherwise was 'telling lies', Simon Danczuk said . Mr Miliband  delivered a speech to activists  in Clydebank, Scotland, today as the party's struggles north of the border continue - with the latest polls showing a landslide victory for the SNP in May . Simon Danczuk was only elected in 2010 but has already established himself as one of Parliament's most prominent backbench MPs. The Rochdale MP led the campaign to expose historic child sexual abuse - revealing in shocking detail the crimes of his paedophile predecessor, Cyril Smith. But Mr Danczuk has also launched a series of attacks on his own party - including over immigration, benefits and the lack of working class MPs. He even criticised his own mother for relying on welfare and revealed he had taken drugs. His profile has also been enhanced by his wife Karen, who has risen to fame after posting a series of provocative selfies on Twitter. He said: 'You get it on the doorstep. If we're having a straight conversation about this, he [Miliband] has an image of being more of a toff than David Cameron. That's how the public see it. 'And what they mean by that is that he's seen as more aloof. They'd prefer to go for a pint with David Cameron than they would with Ed Miliband, that's the reality of it.' Mr Danczuk said if the Labour Party knew the cost of electing Mr Miliband in September 2010 they would have chosen another leader. This scathing criticism, in an interview with the New Statesman, comes amid growing concern in the party over Labour's chances in the election in May. But Mr Danczuk said the Labour Party could be in trouble for years to come. He said: 'I do think the party has almost been hijacked by what I've described previously as a north London liberal elite. It's just so disconnected. 'I think Labour has a real problem if they don't realign themselves actually, after the general election. If they don't start thinking afresh about how they approach politics and how they involve people at a community level.' Mr Danczuk added: 'You know, this north London elite view of the world, just doesn't play in Rochdale, Rotherham, Runcorn or anywhere else beginning with an 'r' outside the M25. 'We should be winning Rugby shouldn't we? Why aren't we winning Rugby – we won't win Rugby. Why won't we win Rugby? It's ridiculous. 'So you can't, as leader, just do set piece speeches for three years – hidden behind a lectern – and hope that gets on the 10 o'clock news and convinces loads of people to vote Labour.' The infamous Gillian Duffy (right) - accused by the former prime minister Gordon Brown of being a 'bigoted women' - opens the new office of Labour MP Simon Danczuk (left) in Rochdale in 2010 . The Labour MP used Twitter to insist he had had a 'very difficult day' and was 'feeling emotional' about the election . Mr Danczuk said voters were also unenthusiastic about the Prime Minister David Cameron and insisted he wanted Ed Miliband to win the election . He said he was trying to get across the need for more working-class politicians in positions of power . Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps MP said Mr Danczuk's remarks showed even Labour MPs knew Mr Miliband 'just isn’t up to the job'. He said: ‘He is a weak leader who it utterly out of touch with the lives and concerns of hardworking taxpayers. ‘Not only is Ed Miliband ‘aloof’, his short-term gimmicks would cause chaos and damage the economic security upon which British families depend.’ But Mr Danczuk later tried to clarify his remarks - insisting that he wanted Mr Miliband to be the next Prime Minister. In a series of tweets, the Labour backbencher said he had been 'feeling emotional' after a tough day.","Simon Danczuk said Miliband was seen as more of a 'toff' than Cameron .

"A foreign mother who was jailed for stabbing her baby has been granted the right to stay in Britain. The Bangladeshi woman, who cannot be named, served five years for attempted murder in 2009 after she attacked her daughter in the midst of a marital breakdown. On her release, a tribunal decided not to deport her – as is usually the case with foreign criminals – so she could still see the child. The Bangladeshi woman, from Tower Hamlets, east London, who served five years for attempted murder in 2009, has been allowed to remain in the UK after the Court of Appeal ruled it was a 'truly exceptional’ case . The Government appealed but the woman, of Tower Hamlets, East London, was yesterday granted leave to remain. Court of Appeal judge Lord Justice Pitchford said the case was ‘truly exceptional’. He said: 'The circumstances of the offence, the bitter suffering of [the mother] following the offence and the clear benefit to the victim of the offence of continued face to face contact with her mother rendered this case truly exceptional. 'In short, despite the generic public interest in deportation of foreign criminals, there was no public interest in further punishing the victim of the crime. 'In my view, the combined circumstances of the crime and its consequences were exceptional and the First-Tier Tribunal was entitled to conclude that separation, which was likely to be permanent, would be cruel both to the offender and to the victim.' The judge heard the appeal with Lord Justice Sullivan and Lady Justice King, who both agreed with the decision. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The Bangladeshi woman served five years for attempted murder in 2009 .

"The Green Party is set to unveil its big weapon for the General Election campaign – a sultry, pouting, middle-aged ‘boyband’ comprising David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage. The party, which is languishing at six per cent in the polls, is recruiting lookalikes to portray the four main party leaders in a cringe-inducing party political broadcast due to be screened next month. Strangely, the Greens are even hiring an actress to play their own leader, the gaffe-prone Natalie Bennett, and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates. Strategists stipulate that her doppelganger be in her late 30s to mid-40s – although Bennett is 49 –and be ‘like a schoolteacher, life experience under her belt. She must also be ‘the voice of reason, friendly, warm and approachable but has a message to get across’. The full excruciating details of what the Greens believe is ‘a fun, clever and refreshing idea’ is revealed in a leaked casting brief. Fake that: Our mock-up of (left to right) party leaders David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage as a boyband . It adds that four male party leaders’ lookalikes ‘should be unnaturally intense, emotional and passionate – like a boyband. Loads of smouldering stares, deep thinking and soulful singing. Thick lashings of powerful slow motion movements and pensive gazes will help intensify the drama. ‘They may be leaders of different parties, but they seem to know the same lyrics to the same song and be in perfect harmony. I like the idea that as the song builds and climaxes, they are literally finishing off each others sentences… That is how ridiculously in harmony they are. ‘Above all, they should all look incredibly pleased with themselves. It will be amusing to have disgruntled reaction shots of the other leaders at the end as the Green Party’s common sense message is delivered.’ On the lookalikes, it adds: ‘It would be great if the leaders were slightly better looking, more buff and hunkier than the actual leaders in real life. Kind of how they see themselves inside their own minds. But this is not a priority. First and foremost they need to register as politicians.’ Less kind critics might suggest that the Greens need to register as politicians themselves. Some of the cringe-inducing lyrics of the Green Party’s song spoof . It’s sweeter when we agree, a party political harmony (Oh baby) Lose your voting inhibitions, join the one true coalition (ohh-ahh-lii-shuuuuun) Let’s frack this green and pleasant land. Come on Eddie, join the band . The public won’t know what to do, if they have to pick from me and you-uuuu . The choice between us couldn’t be clearer. Oxford! Cambridge! Diversity for ya . Whether it’s Trident or High Speed 2, the lesser of four evils is up to you . MoS man: how I gatecrashed world's unfunniest send-up . By Adam Lee-Potter . It is unusual enough to be in the same room as Messrs Cameron, Miliband, Clegg and Farage. But to be in a backstreet Soho studio with 13 versions of them gyrating, pouting and cavorting around was beyond bizarre. Welcome to the casting session for what must go down as the most toe-curlingly awful party political broadcast ever. I secretly infiltrated the Green Party audition under the flimsy guise of being an ersatz David Cameron. It was clear they were desperate. I emailed, just hours before the audition, telling them – truthfully – that Gok Wan once told me I looked like the PM. Don't call us: Our reporter Adam goes to the hideously awkward audition for the Green Party broadcast . Did I say they were desperate? I heard back within minutes – and the woman didn’t ask if I was a professional actor or had an agent. I’m not, clearly! I was told that I would be auditioning for Cameron at 2pm the next day and that the fee – just for turning up – was £250. Super. But the email warned I should be prepared to ‘boyband it up’ – possibly the four most upsetting words I have ever received. At the offices of Die-Cast, all 13 of us were told to learn our lines – which seemed a tad rich of the Green Party when its own leader couldn’t remember hers in a ‘car crash’ interview with London’s LBC radio station. I hurriedly attempted to memorise the lyrics of Take That’s Greatest Day – the mawkish pop video for which we were set to recreate. Then five minutes later, it all changed: we were told to forget that and instead mug up on a ‘It’s sweeter when we all agree’ version. This was rapidly becoming more confusing than a Green Party conference, not least because despite being middle-aged and suited, I don’t look at all like Cameron. But then the other three in ‘my’ boyband looked nothing like their supposed doppelgangers either. ‘Give me some smoulder,’ the director implored. ‘Be as seductive as you can. Give me more.’ I’m 44 years old, for pity’s sake. I did try to smoulder, which is hard enough at the best of times, but painfully embarrassing when you’re told to lip-sync to a tepid backing track. I couldn’t help thinking this was part of the democratic system our forebears died for. That the law requires the nation’s broadcasters to actually screen this rubbish. Chaos loomed when some portly chap – I have no idea whose lookalike he was supposed to be – admitted he didn’t have a suit with him. Desperate: The Greens are even hiring an actress to play their own leader, the gaffe-prone Natalie Bennett (pictured), and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates . The sweet woman in charge duly dispatched him to Marks & Spencer, telling him to take it back for a refund ‘after the gig’. Then the internet went down. Oh, and they couldn’t work out how to play the track. Then it was the volume control. I rang my wife at this point. ‘Is this April Fool’s Day?’ came her reply. Finally, after an anxious, 30-minute delay during which the pros gargled noisily and massaged their vocal cords, and I – um – didn’t, we were on. The brief rehearsal was over and this was the real audition. I was in the first batch of hopefuls, which I took as a promising sign. We were escorted into a small, bright room. Behind the camera were an assortment of trendy types in lumberjack shirts and lots of facial hair. We read out our names and posed for profile shots. We then had to mime along to the song. ‘Try to emote like a real boyband,’ said the director patiently. ‘Really go for it. Use your hands.’ I did try to channel my inner One Direction but I ended up looking like I was having a fit in the deep end of a swimming pool. We carried on prancing about, nonetheless. Then, worryingly, the Clegg double cuddled me – I don’t quite know why – as we moved into the second verse. Truly hideous: Reporter Adam described his efforts as 'David Brent at a teenage disco: excruciating and slightly off' Shakespeare it ain’t, but the Greens clearly hope this song will ram home their point: when there’s little to divide the main party leaders, vote for us instead. Next, we were told to ‘seduce’ the camera, one by one. I pouted, foolishly, and even tried a little growl. One of the crew tittered, not unreasonably, as I awkwardly caressed my chest and even smoothed my eyebrow with a licked finger. Yes, it was truly that hideous. Imagine David Brent at a teenage disco: excruciating and slightly off. Finally, we had to mime to camera as if we were making a political speech. We all flapped the air and did that funny pointy thing with our thumbs that Cameron likes to do. The Miliband lookalike – the only one even remotely like his famous ‘double’ – got especially carried away, letting out an impressive glottal volley of gibberish. Eventually, we were done, much to everybody’s relief. ‘You’ll be hearing from us if you’ve been successful,’ said an assistant. We could say the same of the Green Party. They shouldn’t hold their breath.","Cringe-inducing short film will include actors playing all four party leaders .

"Agony: Roy Parker, 67, waited almost an hour-and-a-half for an ambulance to arrive after he broke his shoulder and wrist . A pensioner seriously injured falling from a ladder waited nearly 90 minutes for an ambulance because the paramedics were on a lunch break. As Roy Parker, 67, lay in agony after breaking his shoulder and wrist at around 11.30am, his neighbour dialled 999. But paramedics did not arrive at his home in Solihull, West Midlands, until shortly before 1pm. West Midlands Ambulance Service has written to Mr Parker’s MP, Caroline Spelman, apologising for its ‘error’ last month. It admitted an ambulance should have gone but its crew was sent back for a meal break. Mr Parker’s wife, Dorothy, 69, said: ‘I arrived home about half an hour after his fall. 'My neighbour was with him. She thought he was going into shock.’ Paramedics had phoned to say they would be there as soon as possible but arrived one and a half hours after the 999 call. 'The paramedics were fantastic. They could see how bad the injuries were, but it is deeply concerning that my husband was left in this state for so long ,; Mrs Parker said. In the letter to Ms Spelman, West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'In summary we did have a vehicle to send but it was sent back for a meal break. 'Caroline, we can only apologise for this error and I know the chief has offered to write to the patient to apologise for our mistake. 'Clearly there was an error in handling the call and I am sorry for the distress this has caused. I hope you are reassured that a review is taking place into what happened.' Meal break: It has since transpired Roy, 67, pictured with wife Dot, waited while the crew had their lunch . A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance added: ‘The initial call suggested he had fallen about 4ft and had hurt his arm and shoulder. 'We were dealing with a 25 per cent increase in 999 calls, many of which were of a more serious nature. ‘As well as being the law, it is right and proper that we give our crews a break. If we didn’t... they would work throughout their 12-hour shift which would put lives at risk – both patients and staff.’","999 was called after Roy Parker broke his shoulder and wrist at 11.30am .

"Three Chinese lawmakers have been given heavy fines after one of the eight illegal Siberian tigers they kept as pets fell to its death from the roof of a 11-storey apartment building. The seven-month-old cub was seen falling from the tower block in the city of Pingdu in eastern China's Shandong province by residents watching a Chinese New Year firework display. Two of the animals - which cannot legally be kept as pets in China - were being temporarily housed on the roof of the building by local businessman Yang Wenzheng, who claimed he was looking after the tigers for a friend who could no longer afford to keep them at his mountain park. Tragic: The seven-month-old cub was seen falling from the tower block in the city of Pingdu in eastern China's Shandong province by residents watching a Chinese New Year firework display . Horrifying: Shocked neighbour Hui Tang, 33, who lives on the third floor said: 'My husband and I were standing at the window when we saw this object go flying past'. Pictured is the dead tiger . Height: The tiger jumped to its death from the roof of this 11-storey building after being startled by fireworks . Mr Yang admitted keeping the two Siberian tigers on the roof of the building to help his friend Cui Jinguang, who was struggling to meet the cost of looking after the animals at his mountain park. As well as the adult and cub given to Mr Yang, Mr Cui also kept an adult and cub for himself. Another friend, named by the South China Morning Post as forestry worker Cui Jinguang, was given a third adult tiger and three cubs to look after. The death of the tiger cub in Pingdu saw police launch an investigation in to where the animals had come from, which eventually led to the conviction of the three men, who are all members of the city's People's Congress. Each of the men was subsequently fined 3,000 yuan (£330), according to local media reports. Caged: Two of the animals (one of which is pictured) were being temporarily housed on the roof of the building by local businessman Yang Wenzheng. Tigers cannot legally be kept as pets in China .

'When we looked down to see what it was we couldn't believe it when we saw that it was a tiger. 'At first we thought it was a toy, but then we saw blood coming from its mouth... We were completely shocked as we couldn't work out how a tiger had got onto the roof.' A police spokesman said: 'the man had signed a contract with the park last year to temporarily foster two tiger cubs. 'He kept them on the roof in a cage because his apartment was too small... On the night of the accident, it seems the cub was so scared of the fireworks it forced its way out and tried to get away, blindly running over the top. These tigers are listed as a Class I protected species in China, and only those who are fully licenced can breed or raise them.","Two Siberian tigers were kept on the roof of a tower block in Pingdu city .

The inscription says: 'Found at Paddington station (Great Western Railway), February 1884, in a suitcase filled with dynamite' 'It’s evoking the feel and atmosphere from the start of the Crime Museum.’ Her colleague Jackie Keily told The Guardian: ‘The term ""silent witness"" is often bandied about, but these objects really are the witnesses to generations of crimes, and each has a story to tell.’ She added that a decision was made on what to show at the Museum of London after talks with Metropolitan Police curators, victims' representatives and the London Policing Ethics Panel. The Crime Museum was set up by an Inspector Neame in 1874 so new officers could see tools of the criminal trade, such as guns disguised as walking sticks and umbrellas. Despite being officially closed to the public, a select group of VIPs have been allowed to view the collection - including author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, magician Harry Houdini and comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Several visitors, including serving officers, have been known to faint at the museum - which is currently held in room 101 at the Met's Victoria Street headquarters near St James's Park. Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said: ‘The artefacts held in the museum will provide visitors with an insight into the evolution of crime investigation and criminal justice. ‘The public will view exhibits from some of the most complex and indeed notorious criminal investigations carried out by the Met, and discover how such crimes were solved.’ Officially closed to the public: The Scotland Yard Crime Museum was set up by an Inspector Neame in 1874 so new officers could see tools of the criminal trade, such as guns disguised as walking sticks and umbrellas .","Selection of 500 items from secret museum going on display this year .

Many of the animals were rescued after being found injured, sick or in some cases taken in after their mothers were found dead. 'These animals are very talkative and can be pretty loud, they even have the nickname 'sea canary birds' because they 'talk' so much.

"If you can’t get rid of your pot belly, no matter how hard you try, blame your Plexin D1 gene. Scientists believe the gene tells fat to gather around the middle, rather than the bottom and thighs. In other words, it influences whether someone is an ‘apple’, with a big tummy, or a ‘pear’, who widens out below the waist. It raises the possibility of pills that stop fat from being stored around the waist – meaning an end to pot bellies and muffin tops. Apple-shaped: Scientists have discovered that a gene called Plexin D1 influences whether a person is an 'apple', with a big belly, or a 'pear' with fat on their hips and thighs . And the benefits wouldn’t just be cosmetic. The discovery of the ‘apple-shape’ gene is important because being an ‘apple’ who stores fat around the middle is worse for health than being a ‘pear’. Unlike the fat that pads out pear-shapes, belly fat wraps around the body’s vital organs and produces hormones and other chemicals that tamper with blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar levels. As a result it raises the risk of a host of health problems including heart disease, diabetes and strokes. To get to the bottom of how fat is stored, the US researchers studied zebra fish, tiny tropical fish whose transparent bodies make it see their inner workings. By using a dye that turned fat cells fluorescent, they showed that fish without a gene called Plexin D1 stored less fat around their abdomen than usual. Muffin top: Fat around the middle is dangerous to health as it wraps itself around vital organs, and raises the risk of health problems including heart disease, diabetes and strokes . Instead, the fat was stored in more a pear-shaped pattern, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. The fish without apple-shape gene were also better at processing sugar – something that should cut the odds of diabetes. With the Plexin-1 gene thought to have a similar role in people, the research paves the way for a drug that stops people from growing big bellies. Researcher Dr James Minchin, of Duke University, in North Carolina, said that this could also be good for health.","Plexin D1 gene influences whether a person is 'apple' or 'pear' shaped .

The couple were welcomed to the state by its most famous export, Muhammad Ali, who praised them as 'the greatest'. Too poorly to meet them in person, the boxing legend addressed the heir to the throne in a letter. It was read aloud following a choir performance of My Old Kentucky Home at the Cathedral of Assumption. 'As you travel back to your homeland, we hope you know how much this city respects and admires the many contributions you have made in the world,' Ali wrote in the message read by Mayor Greg Fischer.

Camilla joined children from Louisville, Kentucky who were part of a 'from field to fork' group learning not only how to grow their produce but cook it. After helping the youngsters plant a rhubarb plant in a plot at Oxmoor Farm, an 18th century estate, she sat around a table in the open air and helped nine-year-old Fred Meadows create the savoury treat. The children use seasonal produce in their cooking so radishes, kale and carrots were added to the pizza - but they were cooked after the Duchess had left the group. Earlier the Duchess had visited a community project called Neighbourhood House, running since 1896 in a disadvantaged area of Louisville. Originally rich members of the community moved into the neighbourhood, with affluent and poor members living together and raising standards. She chatted to Jason Logsdon, 11, who comes to the centre every day to do homework or sport and he told the Duchess he wanted to join the CIA when he is older. He said: 'I knew who she was but not much about her, but she was awesome, she's cool.' Jockey Pat Day joined the Duchess at Churchill Down.

"A 14-year-old Chilean girl who asked the government for permission to die has begun reconsidering her decision. Authorities in the country quickly said no after Valentina Maureira's YouTube video pleading to let doctors euthanize her because she is tired of her struggle with cystic fibrosis began spreading on social media last month. Now the girl is reconsidering after meeting others living with her disease. Scroll down for video . Valentina Maureira, 14, has said she is reconsidering her wish to end her cystic fibrosis with assisted suicide after meeting others surviving with the disease. Above, she met with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet . A YouTube video made by the young girl (right) quickly spread through social media in Chile, prompting a response from the government . 'There are people that made ​​me change the way of thinking,' Maureira told the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, . 'It's a difficult decision,' she said, according to 24Horas.Cl. She said that the idea to end her life first began when she heard about the case of Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old American with terminal brain cancer who died by doctor-assisted suicide last year. Maureira then grabbed the  attention of the country after posting on YouTube a video that appeared to have been shot from a hospital bed. 'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.' Fredy Maureira said his daughter was moved by a visit by a family from Argentina, whose children have been stricken by the incurable respiratory illness. He said she also was given hope by meeting someone who had survived beyond age 20 with the disease. Maribel Oviedo and her father Ernesto traveled to Santiago to 'convey a message of hope,' according to La Voz. The young girl met with Maribel Oviedo (right) 22, of Argentina, who watched her sister died of cystic fibrosis but survived herself after receiving a lung transplant for the disease . Oviedo said that she wanted to deliver a 'message of hope' to Maureira and prove that it is possible to live a 'normal life' after struggling with the disease . The Argentine still maintains a Facebook page dedicated to her sister (pictured) who died of cystic fibrosis in 2013 . Maribel, 22, from Cordoba, watched her sister Marisol die of cystic fibrosis in 2013. She received a lung transplant in 2012 and told the girl that she now lives a normal life. The Argentine offered to go to a doctor's appointment with her because she wants to encourage Maureira to live. They also shared contact information for doctors in Brazil. 'Mission accomplished ... the decision was positive. She wants to travel to Brazil,' Oviedo posted on Facebook after meeting with the Chilean. Cystic fibrosis damages multiple organs, especially the lungs, by causing recurrent infections that damage tissue. The young Maureira said she was frustrated by the lack of options and by how the disease had hurt her quality of life. Euthanasia is not legal in Chile. The country's president Michelle Bachelet visited her in a hospital late last month and spoke with the girl and her father for more than an hour at the Catholic University hospital in Santiago. What was said was not released, but the government provided photographs of the visit, including one of Maureira taking a selfie with the president, who is also a pediatrician. Many people reached out to the girl after hearing about her video, including the president (center) and an Argentine family whose children also have cystic fibrosis . A Chilean presidential spokesman said 'It's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish' Fredy Maureira said that his daughter asked for quality hospitals to fight cystic fibrosis, a marathon for the disease and help making a movie and book about her story. The president responded by sending back a tape recorder for her to take down impressions of her experience, according to Univision. Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish.' The girl's father said he supported his daughter's request, though he added that he 'cried through the night' after he first heard about her wish to die. 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' Mr Maureira said. He now says that his daughter is 'thinking about' her choice. The Chilean health ministry began providing Maureira with psychological assistance as well as medical treatment after getting in touch with her. Maurerira asked the president for better hospitals to treat her disease, as well as a marathon and help making a movie, according to her father Fredy Maureira .","Valentina Maureira, 14, posted video on YouTube asking for euthanasia .

"A university student who went on the rampage with a knife on a busy underground train killing four people and injuring more than 20 others has been sentenced to death. The New Taipei District Court in Taiwan sentenced 21-year-old Cheng Chieh 24 death sentences, one for each of his victims, for the rush-hour attack on a commuter train in the capital Taipei in May last year. The ruling also deprived Cheng of his civil rights for the rest of his life. Death sentece: University student Cheng Chieh who went on the rampage with a knife on an underground train killing four people . Cheng Chieh used a 10-centimetre knife to slash passengers in the chest and stomach, in some cases as they slept, whilst travelling in a carriage on the metro system's longest stretch between two stations, the court heard. He was subdued by police and metro staff after the train pulled into its next station. He had complained when interviewed about having too much stress in his life and said he wanted to get the death penalty, but also wanted to do something big before he died. Cheng was set to obtain a master's degree in business administration and international business from NCKU university in Tainan City this summer. When the attack took place, he was in Taipei for a job interview. He has the right to appeal the verdict but even his parents called for him to be sentenced to death for the attack that also left 22 people injured. Bloodbath: People battle to stop the bleeding as victims lie on the floor of carriages on the underground in Taipei. Student Cheng Chieh has been sentenced to death for the killings . Appearing in court, Cheng showed no reaction when his sentences were announced. Family members of the deceased who were present in court also welcomed the verdict, saying that giving Cheng the death penalty met public expectations. Cheng's father Feng agreed, saying: 'Although he is our child, the crime he committed is unforgivable. 'He should be sentenced to death and face it himself. Only by so doing may the pains inflicted on the victims and the wounded and their families be slightly eased. Guilty: Cheng Chieh who went on a knife rampage on the underground in Taipei which left four people dead and scores more injured . Victim: A commuter lies dead on the underground with an umbrella still by his hand. Student Cheng Chieh has been sentenced to death in Taiwan . Bloody carriages: Horrific scenes from busy underground in Taipei following knife rampage which left four dead. Cheng Chieh has been sentenced to death for four murders and injuring 22 others . He urged judges to carry out the sentence as soon as possible saying: 'We hope Cheng Chieh can act in a correct manner during his next life.' He also said that an apology was meaningless and could not ease his pain. He said he can only hope that there will be no recurrences of such an incident in Taiwan. Court spokeswoman Lien Yu-chyun said the New Taipei City district court considered 'the vicious nature of the method that the defendant ... used to kill to be significant'. She cited public outrage over the case and said that Cheng would be 'hard to reform'. Carnage: Police comb the scene gathering evidence at the underground station in Taipei, Taiwan . Police cordon: An umbrella can be seen lying on the bloody station platform following the knife attack in Taipei in May last year . Before the attack, Cheng posted a message on his Facebook page saying he 'wanted to do something big'. He told authorities later that the stabbings felt 'like slicing tofu,' according to local news reports. Ahead of the verdict, Taiwan's Apple Daily newspaper quoted him as saying that he would not mind receiving a death sentence. Taiwanese book publisher and historian Yang Lian-fu said: 'People are likely to support Cheng's sentence, with some considering him 'a monster that rose from hell'.' But Yang added that some Taiwanese worry that the case points to problems in preparing young people for the homework, job searches and family pressures that have intensified over the past 40 years. Frenzy: Media jostle to picture Cheng Chieh who was given 24 death sentences for the bloody rampage on an underground train in Taiwan . Deadly: Cheng Chieh was given 24 death sentences for the murderous spree on an underground train in Taiwan . Cheng has been described as a homebody who was fond of computer games but who complained about the stress in his life for which the only way out was the death penalty. Yang warned however that there may be other instances, saying: 'Cheng Chieh is an isolated case, but his isolated case has its place in today's society. There are people who are lost or there are things in society that make them feel unsatisfied, like they have no goals in life.' The verdict adds to Taiwan's death row total that stands at more than 100. The number of executions, which are carried out by shooting, declined after 2000 due to public opposition, with none between 2006 and 2009. They resumed in 2010 following a change in president and renewed sentiment in favour of the policy.","Wounded 22 passengers in bloody rampage on tube's longest stretch .

"Boasting nothing more than an empty, concrete shell on the top level, the 'Aurora' Soul penthouse has sold for $7 million to property tycoon, Tony Fung. The aim of stripping the property for the sale was to attract a buyer who can stamp their personality on it. The gamble worked. Mr Fung had to beat six other bidders to buy the massive four-floor apartment on the Gold Coast. The apartment with its own opulent pool, luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque, became Australia's most expensive penthouse, in 2006 when an agreement was reached to sell it for nearly $17 million. But the deal with Brisbane businessman Charlie Caltabiano fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute. Since then, the penthouse has been stripped of every piece of furniture, every fitting, the walls, the ceiling and even the kitchen sink. Scroll down for video . Gutted. The living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance, all fittings and furnishings have been removed, even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the Gold Coast, though, is still the same . The previous fit-out is long gone as the Soul Penthouse prepares to go under the hammer . The Soul Penthouse is one of the stand-out buildings along the Gold Coast skyline . The 63-year-old Hong Kong businessman is no foreigner to expanses in need of some love. He is planning to develop an $8.15 billion 'Aquis' casino and resort in Yorkey's Knob, Cairns, causing much controversy among locals. McGrath agent James Ledgerwood told The Courier Mail that this high profile buyer will attract a lot of attention to the Soul building. 'Given the new owner and his expectations, it's safe to say it will become one of the icons of penthouses in Australia.' Ledgerwood also added that spaces like this one are unique due to their versatility. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' James Ledgerwood admitted. The interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting Mr Fung's personal touch . Today: The bare bones living area. 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we stripped it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too' Mr Ledgerwood of selling agents McGrath told Daily Mail Australia . 'It's similar to buying a vacant house lot, but 220 metres up in the sky and with the highest swimming pool in Queensland,' he said. A spokesperson for Mr. Fung said that he was ecstatic with the recent purchase. 'It is a vote of confidence in the Queensland economy and an important addition to his property holdings in the state,' he said. Fung already owns 447 hectares worth of properties in the Gold Coast hinterland as well as an Innisfail farm, a private golf course in Noosa and he purchased Casino Canberra in December. Agent James Legerwood had previously told Daily Mail Australia that this property was a rare gem, particularly on the Gold Coast in Australia. He and co-partner John Natoli were brought in, with a clear brief, take whatever measures are needed to sell it. All cupboards and fixtures have been removed from the 'old Aurora'. It's been gutted after the $17 million sale fell through . McGrath Broadbeach selling agent James Ledgerwood. He says the new appeal of this four-level 1040 square metre property 'is that it is very, very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want, particularly here on the Gold Coast' As it once was. The luxurious pool-side look (above) has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version (below) shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . As it is now. The luxurious pool-side look has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . They took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit-out . 'Look, we had to admit that it (the fit-out) that was there was not very appealing, so we decided that it needed to be ripped up.' 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse, so we began by stripping it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too,' Mr Ledgerwood added. The Soul Penthouse starts on level 70 and winds its way up four levels. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' he said. At least the BBQ is still in place. One of the biggest talking points all along for the Soul Penthouse has been the swimming pool and spa area, the highest of their kind anywhere in Queensland . Eight car spaces are provided down below and even that area had been cleared out prior to the auction . However, Ledgerwood added it had some serious appeal. It's position at more than 220 metres above the ground, four levels (70-73), boasting 'the highest swimming pool and spa in Queensland', no less than eight secure basement car spaces (which have also had fittings removed) and 'full resort facilities including pools, gym and gardens'. 'This will give them (buyers) the opportunity to create their own vision and take advantage of some of the most spectacular views in Australia, and create a residence of world-class standing.' he said. 'You have spectacular views - out to the Hinterland to the west, you look east out to the ocean, then up to Stradbroke (Island) in the north and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice.'

"A follower of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster claims he was discriminated against when he was told he may no longer wear a colander on his head in a driver's licence photo. Last year, Preshalin Moodley, 20, was issued a provisional driver's licence by staff at Service NSW Parramatta, in Sydney's west. He was photographed for the licence wearing the spaghetti strainer on his head after asking staff whether it was OK to wear a religious symbol. Preshalin Moodley, 20, was issued a provisional driver's licence last year while wearing a spaghetti strainer on his head, which he said is a symbol of his religion, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti monster. 'I put my colander on. She just stared at me, didn't say anything,' Mr Moodley recalled . In an apparent poke at organised religion, Pastafarians say they believe in the 'spaghetti monster' and adherents say their religion is as legitimate as any other. Mr Moodley received a letter from Service NSW last Tuesday, March 3, and was informed he would have to have his licence reissued so a 'photograph can be retaken without any item on your head'. 'Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) have advised that this photograph does not meet the current requirements, as you were wearing a colander on your head,' the letter to Mr Moodley said. 'The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is not a recognized (sic) religion and as such the wearing of the colander in this photograph does not meet current requirements.' It warned 'further action may taken' if he failed to comply. Mr Moodley is pictured here with a plastic colander on his head. A 'Pastafarian', the western Sydney resident has started an online petition requesting Roads Minister Duncan Gay . Mr Moodley, a science student at the University of Western Sydney, said he was 'frustrated' and surprised by the demand and has pledged to fight the ruling. 'They don't do this to any other religion,' he said. His supporters have started an online petition calling for Pastafarians to be allowed to 'wear their religious headwear and observe their religion as they see fit'. 'Even though it looks like a joke and (that) we're trying to take the mickey out of them, we're completely serious,' Mr Moodley said. 'To an outsider who doesn't know our goals, we look like a bunch of crazy people wearing colanders, eating spaghetti, and drinking beer. 'We're completely serious about what we're doing and I would not go this far for a practical joke. We really want Pastafarianism to be treated as equally as Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, etc. Mr Moodley secured media attention after managing to obtain his license with the colander on his head last year. 'When it came to getting my photo done, I asked if religious headwear was allowed in the photo. She (the staff member) said yes. 'I put the colander on. She just stared at me didn't say anything. I put it on and that was it.' This a popular artistic interpretation of the so-called 'Flying Spaghetti Monster', who is hailed as a diety in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster - which is generally seen as a light-hearted parody of religion . A Roads and Maritime Services spokeswoman confirmed this letter, sent to Mr Moodley, was legitimate. 'Followers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster movement, known as Pastafarians, are not part of a religion recognised in NSW or other areas of Australia,' a Roads and Maritime Services spokeswoman said.
