"The most expensive home ever listed in the Kansas City area is on the market for a staggering $14 million despite the fact that it is located next door to the largest refuge dump in the area. The property was until recently the home of Ron Deffenbaugh Sr., a self-made multi-millionaire who created Deffenbaugh Industries Inc., a waste management business which operated the Johnson County Landfill next door. Deffenbaugh owned the land and decided to build his dream home it 2009, despite the fact that 1.8 million tons of household waste and other garbage continues to be dumped nearby each year. The RD Ranch was until recently the home of Ron Deffenbaugh Sr., a self-made multi-millionaire who created Deffenbaugh Industries Inc., a waste management business which operated the nearby dump . The Johnson County Landfill can't be seen from the mansion, but neighbors say its presence is evidence when the wind blows the right direction . A freak accident in 2007 left Ron Deffenbaugh almost completely paralysized and doctors told him that he wasn’t likely to live much longer. He died in August . The landfill can't be seen from the mansion, but neighbors say its presence is all too evidence in certain conditions. 'It depends on how bad the weather is,' neighbor Bruce Bird told The Kansas City Star. 'You get some evenings when it’s calm and it’s pretty rank.' Last year, the city of Shawnee fielded 41 odor complaints on 35 different days against the Johnson County Landfill. The location of the mansion – known as the RD Ranch - isn’t the only unusual thing about it. It was also built specially to cope with the fact that Deffenbaugh was a quadriplegic. A freak accident in 2007 left him almost completely paralyzed and so the 21 room, 13,000-square-foot mansion was built especially to cater to his needs. One unusual feature is that every room features a hookup for the air tubes that Deffenbaugh needed to breathe. The 21 room, 13,000-square-foot mansion was built especially to cater to his needs and the wood floors on the main level are Brazilian cherry wood . One unusual feature is that every room features a hookup for the air tubes that Deffenbaugh needed to breathe . Outside are waterfalls and fountains, an indoor-outdoor swimming pool and horse stables . The opulent five-bedroom property includes a built-in saltwater aquarium . The central oxygen system and the backup generator to run it in case the power went out are in an attached garage. The home also has a geothermal heating and cooling system, with tubes supplying warmth under the floors. After his accident, doctors told Deffenbaugh that he wasn’t likely to live much longer, but in fact he lived for another seven years and his passing away last August aged 73. During his final years living in the mansion the twice divorced man was tended to dozens of staff. No expense was spared to ensure that Deffenbaugh's final years were comfortable. All the furniture is custom-built and the wood floors on the main level are Brazilian cherry wood. The opulent five-bedroom property includes a built-in saltwater aquarium and a 120-square-foot screen home theater. The house has five full bathrooms and four half baths and even the towel racks in the master bathroom are heated. Outside are waterfalls and fountains, an indoor-outdoor swimming pool and horse stables. The basement includes a walk-in refrigerator and walk-in freezer, as well as a commercial washer and dryer set. The trustees of Deffenbaugh’s estate have hired Crown Realty to sell the property, they say neighbors have assured them that the landfill odors causes little discomfort.

"The Conservatives are planning a ‘kill Ukip’ campaign in the Kent constituency where Nigel Farage is standing for Parliament after he vowed to quit as party leader if he loses . Tory HQ is planning a ‘kill Ukip’ campaign in the Kent constituency where Nigel Farage is standing for Parliament after he vowed to quit as party leader if he loses. Mr Farage declared yesterday that it would be ‘curtains’ for him if he fails to win the Ukip target seat of South Thanet. He conceded it would be impossible for him to continue to dictate Ukip policy without a seat in the House of Commons. Ukip is aiming to win around half a dozen seats, but Mr Farage appears to face a tougher fight than Douglas Carswell, the Tory defector who won a big majority when he stood for Ukip in a by-election. Polls suggest he is in a three-way battle with Labour and the Conservatives. The Tories hold the seat, while Labour previously held it with slightly different borders. Conservative strategists believe Mr Farage has made a significant blunder by tying his fortunes in South Thanet to his future as party leader. ‘This is a great opportunity,’ said one. ‘We can now make this a decapitation campaign. If voters who have previously backed other parties want to stop Ukip, they can vote for us and cut the head off the snake.’ The strategist said that if Mr Farage stood down after losing the seat, Mr Carswell was likely to take over and ‘that would be the end of Ukip’. Other candidates to succeed the Ukip leader include communities spokesman Suzanne Evans and former journalist Patrick O’Flynn, both Euro MPs. Mr Farage appears at odds over several areas of policy with key members of his team, Mr Carswell, who has expressed concern about the ‘ugly nativism’ of some Ukip supporters and spoken in favour of immigration. The Clacton MP is also seen as lacking in the broad popular appeal of Mr Farage by Tory campaign chiefs. A Survation poll commissioned by a Ukip donor in South Thanet found Mr Farage to be ahead, but one previous survey had him neck and neck with the Tories and another put the Tories ahead. In an extract from a new book by the Ukip leader, The Purple Revolution, serialised in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Farage made clear he would quit as party leader if he fails to become an MP. ‘It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat,’ he wrote. ‘What credibility would Ukip have in the Commons if others had to enunciate party policy in parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest? ‘Was I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms? No – if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.’ Yesterday Ukip won a boost when broadcasting regulator Ofcom awarded it a second party election broadcast on commercial TV and radio on the basis that it is now a ‘major party’. David Cameron's strategists hope that defeating Mr Farage would 'cut the head off the snake' of Ukip . The bodys guaranteed Ukip a minimum of two broadcasts in England and Wales on ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, alongside the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats. But it said the Greens had not demonstrated sufficient electoral support to justify a similar elevation in status. Mr Farage said: ‘This confirms that Ukip is now a major party in British politics. Voters should now know that despite what all the other parties are going to tell them, the truth is self-evident: if you believe in Britain, and want to vote Ukip, you’ll get a Ukip MP. It’s great news.’","Farage declared that it would be ‘curtains’ for him if loses in South Thanet .
Tories plan to appeal to voters from across the spectrum to help defeat him ."
"A prostitute killed her pimp boyfriend then posed as him on Facebook for five years in an attempt to fool his family and get her hands on his money. June Buttle, 56, killed her 'domineering' partner of ten years Thomas Groome, 54, by hitting him over the head with a piece of wood before his body was dismembered and burned, a court heard. She then used his Facebook account to try and convince his family that he had run away to Portugal where he was living the single life and wanted nothing more to do with them. Sheffield Crown Court heard Buttle then tried to access Mr Groome's bank accounts where he had stored 150,000 Euros he was awarded after being abused in a care home as a child. June Buttle, 56 (left), has been jailed for 16 years after admitting killing partner of ten years Thomas Groome, 54, then posing as him on Facebook before trying to steal his money . Today  Buttle was jailed for 16 years after admitting manslaughter, with Mrs Justice Andrews telling her: 'You lied so much and so continually that it is difficult to separate the truth from the fiction.' Mr Groome had been in a long-term relationship with Buttle, but the court heard that it was sexually abusive, and that Mr Groome had often forced her into prostitution. Mr Groome was a car salesman by trade, but often had little to live on, staying in friends' houses and  caravans, often without heating or running water. But in 2009 he was awarded 150,000 Euros compensation by a court after he was found to have been abused in a care home in County Offaly, Ireland. The court heard that Mr Groome had used the money to buy a caravan and two cars, and had planned to use the money to move to Portugal and open a bar. However, three days before he died Mr Groome got into an argument with Buttle after she refused to move abroad, and accused him of keeping the money from her. The court was told he flew into a rage after she refused to have sex with him and stormed off. Three days later, on New Year's Day 2010, Buttle and her son, Jason Thaxter, beat Mr Groome over the head with two pieces of wood, before rolling his body up in a carpet, the court heard. It is not known exactly what became of the body, but Buttle is reported to have told friends that Mr Thaxter cut the corpse into pieces before burning it on a bonfire. However, Buttle has refused to tell police what happened and the Crown Prosecution Service said that there was not enough evidence to charge Mr Thaxter with disposing of the body. After Mr Groome disappeared Buttle began posting status updates on his Facebook page pretending to be him, and claiming he was still alive. She falsely suggested he had run off with a younger woman in Portugal and didn’t want to contact his family because he thought they were after his money. Buttle killed Mr Groome at this house in Doncaster on New Year's Day in 2010 after a row. She is believed to have attacked him with son Jason Thaxter, who is thought to have burned the body . Posts she wrote on his page read: 'Never want to return to England or Ireland, too many bad memories' and 'Enjoying my freedom now I’m single.' Buttle then tried to get access to Mr Groome's money, which she believed was being stored in a UK bank account that she had access to. But unbeknownst to her, the cash was actually being stored in a separate account in Ireland, leaving her with little more than access to Mr Groome's benefits money. Over the next few months she took £800 from Mr Groome, including £400 taken from his body, but was unable to get her hands on the larger haul. In desperation she persuaded another man to go to Ireland and pose as Mr Groome, saying he had lost his debit card, in order to access the money, but failed. Adrian Waterman QC, prosecuting, said: 'Her main aim was to get access to the many thousands of Euros or pounds of the compensation money. Fortunately she was unable to do so.' In the meantime, police began investigating My Groome's disappearance after his family became concerned when they were unable to contact him abroad. Investigators eventually contacted Buttle's friend John Ward, with whom she lived, and Lorraine Kelly, who said she had confessed to the killing. Mr Ward told officers: 'She said: ""We just gave him the one, two, three. We banged him with a baseball bat and he’s been put on a bonfire.”' Miss Kelly added: 'She told me: “All men are bastards. I sorted that bastard. He was a hard bastard to get down but Jason and I got him down.” “He’s cut up and in bits in bins. No-one will ever find him. He’s in bins, burned and cut up.”' Officers first interviewed Buttle in 2013, but she kept up her charade for another two years before finally admitting what she had done. Officers have spent more than £1million in trying to unravel the case and nearly 100 police officers have been involved in the UK, Ireland and Portugal. Doreen Groome, Mr Groome’s sister, said: 'Five years of not knowing what has happened to him and the whereabouts of his body have been mental torture to the family. Sheffield Crown Court was told that Buttle tried to access 150,000 Euros (£110,000) that Mr Groome was paid in compensation after being abused in a care home as a child, but was unable to get her hands on it . 'Not being able to bury Tommy has been indescribable.' Mr Groome's daughter Sinead added: 'The people who did this were meant to care for him. It is heartless and cruel that they knew we would never see him again.' Dexter Dias QC, defending, said the couple’s relationship had been marred by domestic violence and Mr Groome had forced his partner to work as a prostitute since he came out of prison. 'Over a period of years he effectively used to pimp her out,' he said. 'It is an important contextualising matter. When the incident did happen she lost control.' He went on: 'It was something which occurred on the spur of the moment. It was not pre-meditated, she delievered a single blow.' The court also heard that Mr Groome, who had a long history of offending, was himself convicted of manslaughter after stabbing his own son, Christopher, 19, in 1999. Christopher died after the pair got into a 'tussle' in a caravan in County Offlay. Mr Groome previously described how he watched his son die in his arms. He went on the run but was eventually caught sentenced to seven years at Dublin in 2004. The term was reduced on appeal and he was released the following year because of the time he had already served on remand. Buttle was said to have stood by him when he came out and they moved to the UK and were staying with family in South Yorkshire when Groome lost his life.","June Buttle, 56, killed partner Thomas Groome, 54, on New Year's Day 2010 .

"Ed Miliband's insistence that 'hell yes' he is tough enough to be Prime Minister has secured Labour a bounce in the polls. The first full survey since Mr Miliband and David Cameron faced a TV grilling shows Labour has opened up a four-point lead over the Conservatives. But the party's election strategy was in peril tonight after a senior campaign chief admitted that under Labour plans, borrowing would rise. The new YouGov survey has Labour on 36 per cent with the Tories trailing on 32 per cent. The four-point lead puts Labour on course to win 314 seats, with the Conservatives on 251 . 34 per cent of voters still think Mr Cameron would make the best PM, compared to 19 per cent for Mr Miliband, 9 per cent for Ukip leader Nigel Farage and 5 per cent for Lib Dem Nick Clegg . Recent polls have put the Tories and Labour within one or two points of each other. But the new YouGov survey has Labour on 36 per cent with the Tories trailing on 32 per cent. The four-point lead puts Labour on course to win 314 seats, with the Conservatives on 251. But today Labour was accused of 'letting the cat out of the bag' on plans to increase state borrowing. Election campaign vice-chairwoman Lucy Powell said the party 'may use some investment borrowing'. Labour has promised only to eliminate the current deficit on day-to-day spending by the end of the next Parliament, leaving open the option of borrowing money to invest in capital projects. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says Labour's plans allowed them to maintain an overall deficit as high as £30 billion by 2020 - at a time when the Tories aim to be running a surplus of £7 billion.' Ms Powell later insisted she did not recognise the £30 billion figure, telling the BBC's Sunday Politics: 'We are going to balance the books for current expenditure by the end of the Parliament. We may use some investment borrowing for much-needed investment but not for day-to-day spending. 'Those figures are other people's figures. It depends on what the books are like.' Conservative Treasury minister Priti Patel said: 'The cat's out of the bag - Labour have finally had it dragged out of them that they'd borrow more if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street.' In Thursday's TV ocntest, Mr Miliband was called a 'North London geek' who would be torn to shreds by Russian President Vladimir Putin . Jeremy Paxman appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing Prime Minister David Cameron . Mr Cameron is due to visit Buckingham Palace tomorrow to inform the Queen of the official start of the general election campaign. Mr Miliband faced the roughest ride during the Sky News/Channel TV battle, the first of the election campaign. The Labour leader was challenged by the studio audience about why he was so 'gloomy' and told his brother David would have done a better job. During a bruising interview with Jeremy Paxman he was called a 'North London geek' who would be torn to shreds by Russian President Vladimir Putin, and admitted Labour mistakes on spending, immigration and not tackling inequality. But he hit back at Paxman's claim that Labour cannot win a majority, insisting: 'You're important Jeremy but not that important. It's the British people who decide.' And challenged about his ability to take difficult decisions, Mr Miliband shot back: But am I tough enough? Hell yes, I'm tough enough.' The 'hell yes' slogan has bee seized on by the Labour party, which has had it printed on t-shirts for sale to raise money for campaign coffers. A snap poll by ICM after Thursday's contest showed Mr Cameron was the victor, with 54 per cent saying he was the winner to 46 per cent who backed Mr Miliband. But a YouGov survey for the Sunday Times showed 49 per cent thought the Labour leader came across the best as against 34 per cent for the Prime Minister. However, 34 per cent of voters still think Mr Cameron would make the best PM, compared to 19 per cent for Mr Miliband, 9 per cent for Ukip leader Nigel Farage and 5 per cent for Lib Dem Nick Clegg. Mr Miliband launched Labour's election campaign on Friday claiming the race to Number 10 was 'neck and neck'. Labour has also made gains in an Opinium poll for The Observer. The Tories dropped two points to 34 per cent in a week, with Labour unchanged on 33 per cent. The poll showed Ukip down one point on 13 per cent, while the Liberal Democrats were up one on 8 per cent. The Greens were also up one on 7 per cent.","New YouGov opinion poll puts Labour on 36% and Tories on 32% .

"The parents of an eight-month-old girl who died after she became wedged between the bed and wall of a Connecticut hotel room were visiting the area to appear on The Maury Show. They were reportedly there to film an episode that was meant to reveal the identity of the child's biological father. On Wednesday morning the 27-year-old mother woke up at the Stamford Plaza Hotel to find that her baby wasn't breathing and told officers the child must have fallen off the bed in the middle of the night, according to police. The parents of an eight-month-old girl who died after becoming wedged between the bed and wall of a Connecticut hotel room were visiting the area to appear on The Maury Show (file photo) Her story was supported by the 25-year-old man who said he woke up when he heard the mother scream, according to NBC New York. An autopsy revealed there was no evidence the infant had experienced physical or sexual abuse, or neglect. A cause of death has not yet been confirmed, according to Stamford Police Lt. Diedrich Hohn. The couple also have a two-year-old son, who was sleeping in the same bed as his mother was was unharmed. Police said the Department of Children and Families and Child Guidance have been notified. No criminal charges have been filed. Hohn confirmed that the family had traveled from Ohio to film an episode for Maury Povich's daytime talk show, but would not comment on their specific segment would be about. A source, who asked to remain unidentified, told the Stamford Advocate the episode was going to reveal on-air who the infant's biological father was based on the results of a paternity test. The Maury Show is infamous for its dramatic paternity reveals to the point where Maury's big reveal on whether the man is question is the father has become a catchphrase in itself. Hohn revealed to the Stamford Advocate that multiple glasses and bottles of alcohol were strewn across the couple's hotel room, and that they had been drinking in the hotel lobby. But he said investigators were still unsure if alcohol had played a role or if there was an issue of child endangerment in the infant's death. He said the Stamford State Attorney's office will decide whether to file any charges against the couple. An NBCUniversal spokesman said 'everyone at The Maury Show' was 'deeply saddened by this profound tragedy'.

"The burned metal and mangled electronics in these images could belong to the first American aircraft to go down in Syria since the U.S. began airstrikes on ISIS inside the country.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has described a secret meeting with officials last year when Russia decided it would take Crimea — the Black Sea region that Moscow annexed from Ukraine last March. In a trailer for an upcoming documentary, shown on state-owned television late Sunday, Putin said that he met with security officials in February to make plans for saving Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled power after months of pro-European protests in the Ukrainian capital. 'We got ready to get him right out of Donetsk by land, by sea or by air,' he said. 'Heavy machine guns were mounted there so that there wouldn't be much discussion about it.' Scroll down for video . Russian president Vladimir Putin, who has described a secret meeting with officials last year when Russia decided it would take Crimea . Putin said that after the meeting he told the security chiefs that they would be 'obliged to start working to return Crimea to Russia.' The minute-long trailer was overlaid with dramatic music and sweeping shots of the Crimean coast. The channel, Rossiya-1, did not specify when the full film would be released. The Kremlin originally denied that it had sent troops into Crimea, though Putin later announced on state television that Russian troops had been sent in. Yanukovych was safely on Russian soil by late February, when Russia's military was establishing its presence in Crimea. Putin said that he met with security officials in February to make plans for saving Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych, pictured . The virtually bloodless seizure of Crimea - a Black Sea peninsula with an ethnic Russian majority and where Moscow has a naval base - was followed by a pro-Moscow insurgency in the east of Ukraine. About 6,000 people have been killed in the fighting in eastern Ukraine. A fragile ceasefire, greed last month in Minsk, has largely held so far. Western governments have condemned Russia's intervention in Crimea as illegal, with the European Union and United States imposing sanctions on Moscow.

"Horror: Judge Susan Criss has said she believes Robert Durst left a severed cat's head on her doorstep . A judge who oversaw the acquittal of Robert Durst in a murder trial says she believes the suspected killer left a severed cat's head on her doorstep. Judge Susan Criss presided over Durst's trial in Texas when the real estate millionaire was acquitted of shooting and dismembering his neighbor in Galveston, Texas. But now, she has said she believes the real estate millionaire is a 'serial killer' and that he killed his dogs to practice cutting up corpses. Judge Criss told 'Inside Edition': 'This was a perfectly clean and preserved cat head cut up by someone who knew what they were doing laying right there.' When asked who she thought did it, Criss replied: 'I strongly believe it was Robert Durst.' Real estate millionaire Durst was arrested last Saturday in New Orleans for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. Durst has been charged with murder in a Los Angeles killing 15 years ago, and has been suspected — but never charged — in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. His arrest came shortly before the finale of the HBO series 'The Jinx' which detailed his links to the three killings. Judge Criss also said that she believes a young Durst killed his dogs and practiced cutting them up. She claimed: 'He had seven dogs and he named every one of them 'Igor' and they all came to some unnatural deaths. Some very bizarre unnatural deaths. Suspect: Robert Durst was arrested after he seemed to give himself away during a taped interview for an HBO documentary investigating his possible links to three killings . 'He practiced on those dogs and that's where he got some of those skills at cutting people up.' The judge was referring to remarks made by Durst's younger brother, Douglas, last year when he told an interviewer that Robert had a 'series' of seven Alaskan Malamute dogs, each named Igor, who 'all died mysteriously, of different things, within six months of his owning them.' Durst was charged on Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Susan Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. On Tuesday, Durst was transferred to a prison wing for the mentally ill in New Orleans while he awaits extradition to LA to face the first-degree murder charge. The troubled real estate heir was moved to the acute mental health facility at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in Louisiana because he is considered a suicide risk, according to the sheriff's office on Wednesday. Arrested: Durst is pictured being transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on Tuesday . Questions also surfaced over his links to two missing California girls. But police in Oakland, California, say they have found no evidence to link him to the 1997 disappearance of Charlotte teenager Kristen Modafferi. A statement released yesterday said:  'The Oakland Police Department conducted an investigation with the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the 1997 disappearance of Kristen Modafferi. 'The investigation was open and active for several years. At this time we do not have any evidence that indicates Robert Durst was involved in her disappearance.' Police in Eureka, California, do however remain interested in Durst in connection with another missing persons case. Karen Mitchell, 16, was last seen on November 25, 1997 after leaving her aunt's Eureka home.","Judge Susan Criss made the gruesome discovery outside her home .

"Photos of US ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert meeting with the country's leaders have emerged for the first time since the envoy was attacked by a knife-wielding pro-North Korean activist. Lippert is recovering at Severance Hospital in Seoul, and was able to meet with US Navy Admiral James Winnefeld as well as members of South Korea's ruling and opposition parties. Police are charging the activist, Kim Ki-jong, 55, with murder after he slashed the ambassador while screaming demands for Korean reunification. The attack Thursday on Lippert, at a forum about reunification, prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice,' that left deep gashes and damaged the ambassador's tendons and nerves. Scroll down for video . Recovering: US ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert, (left), meets with US Navy Admiral James Winnefeld following an attack by a knife-wielding activist who slashed the envoy's face and arm . Hospital visits: Photos of Lippert meeting with politicians including opposition leader Moon Jae-In (left) emerged on Sunday as the ambassador was recovering at Severance Hospital in Seoul . On the mend: Leaders from the ruling Saenuri party met with Lippert on Sunday as authorities work to investigate activist attacker Kim Ki-jong . North Korean state media said the attack was 'deserved punishment'. Lippert, 42, is recovering well but has complained of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in a televised briefing. Doctors will remove the 80 stiches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and say he could be out of the hospital on Wednesday. Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months. Police, meanwhile, searched the offices of the suspect for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved . Kim was detained on Friday and police seized 30 copies of books and print materials from his home, some of which were pro-North Korea, according to Yonhap News. Dumbfounded: Kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Lippert on Thursday morning, which left the ambassador covered in blood . Taken by surprise: Injured Ambassador Lippert is seen leaving the performing arts center where he was slashed by Kim Thursday morning . Suspect: Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against Kim Ki-jong, who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for Korean reunification . Having material in support of Pyongyang is not illegal, but distributing material propagandizing the isolated communist regime is banned in the South. Authorities plan on charging Kim with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction. A further charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathizing with the North Korean government, was being considered. The anti-US activist has denied that he intended to kill Lippert. As part of their investigation they have also requested Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government. Kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said. While the North seemed to praise the attacks in its previous comments, its Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said Sunday that linking the slashing to its government was part of an 'anti-DPRK smear campaign'. In custody: The 55-year-old Kim reportedly attacked  Lippert before he gave a speech at a breakfast meeting. Above, the anti-US demonstrator being taken into custody on Thursday . Aftermath:  Lippert appeared on Thursday wrapped in a neck bandage after being treated for his injuries, which include slashing wounds and nerve damage . Kim, who has a long history of anti-US protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. He told police it was meant as a protest of annual US-South Korean military drills that started Monday — exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion. Kim said the drills, which Seoul and Washington say are purely defensive, ruined efforts for reconciliation between the Koreas, according to police officials. While most South Koreans look at the US presence favorably, America infuriates some leftists because of its role in Korea's turbulent modern history. Washington, which backed the South during the 1950-53 Korean War against the communist North, still stations 28,500 troops on the peninsula, and anti-U.S. activists see the annual military drills with Seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified Korea. 'South and North Korea should be reunified,' Kim shouted as he slashed Lippert with a 10-inch knife, police and witnesses said. Right before:  Lippert pictured above, seated at the breakfast table just prior to being attacked by Kim Thursday morning . Pro-American: While South Korea is one of America's strongest allies in Asia, there are factions of the country that are against the strong US military presence. Above, US-South Korea alliance supporters . Divided peninsula: South Korean protesters shout slogans as they hold the photos of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center and right, the late leaders Kim Jong Il, second from left, and Kim Il Sung, left . Stained: Police say the ambassador was about to make a speech when Kim pushed him from behind and then started slashing him with a knife. Above, investigators survey the blood-spattered table on Thursday . The attack raised questions about security in a city normally seen as ultra-safe, despite regular threats of war from Pyongyang. Kim is well-known among police and activists as one of a hard-core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes. Police didn't consider the possibility that Kim, who has ties to the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation would show up for the group's breakfast meeting, according to a Seoul police official who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. Outspoken: Kim Ki-jong reportedly has a history of public outbursts. Pictured above in an undated file photo from a prior protest . US ambassadors have security details, but their size largely depends on the threat level of the post. Seoul is not considered to be a particularly high threat post despite its proximity to the North Korean border. It's not clear how many guards Lippert had, but they would have been fewer than the ambassadors in most of the Middle East. Seoul's Foreign Ministry said it was the first time a foreign ambassador stationed in modern South Korea had been injured in a violent attack. However, the Japanese ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when Kim threw a piece of concrete at him, according to police. Kim, who was protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea, hit the ambassador's secretary instead, media reports said, and was sentenced to a three-year suspended prison term over the attack. The website of the Woorimadang activist group that Kim heads describes the group's long history of anti-U.S. protests. Photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul to protest the U.S.-South Korean military drills, which are to run until the end of April. North Korea's state-controlled media crowed Thursday that Kim's attack reflected the South Korean people's protests against the US for driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills. US Secretary of State John Kerry, in Saudi Arabia for meetings with regional leaders, said the US 'will never be intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.' Security: South Korean police stand guard outside Gangbuk Samsung hospital where Ambassador Lippert was taken after the attack. Doctors say he needed 80 stitches for the wound on his face . Protection: South Korean police patrol outside the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on March 5. The protection of foreign dignitaries and embassies is customarily the responsibility of the host country . Activists in Seoul, meanwhile, expressed worries that the attack on Lippert would harm the public image of peaceful protesters, or prompt the conservative government to suppress their activities. Small to medium-sized demonstrations regularly occur across Seoul, and most are peaceful. But scuffles with police do break out occasionally, and the burning of effigies of North Korean and Japanese leaders is also common. Some demonstrators have also severed their own fingers, thrown bodily fluids at embassies and tried to self-immolate. Lippert became ambassador last October and has been a regular presence on social media and in speeches and presentations during his time in Seoul. He's regularly seen walking his Basset Hound, Grigsby, near his residence, not far from where the attack happened. His wife gave birth in Korea and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name. An elderly man offered dog meat to the recovering ambassador, but it was rejected because of hospital safety rules. Canine meat is thought to help heal wounds and is commonly offered to surgery patients. While South Korea is one of the U.S.'s closest Asian allies, America has been partially blamed for the severing of Korea into two countries. In 1910, the Japanese Empire took control of unified Korea which they ruled as a colony through the end of World War II. When the Empire fell IN 1945, it was decided in a United Nations agreement that Korea be split in half at the 38th parallel. The U.S. established a trusteeship in the south while the Soviets took over in the north, leading to the creation in 1948 of two separate countries. Above, American troops board a boat bound for South Korean at the onset of the Korean War in 1950 . However, both sides thought the situation was temporary that that their respective country would ultimately become the sole head of unified Korea. Cold War tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union only fueled these ambitions, and in 1950 the North Korean army invaded the south backed by Chinese and Soviet soldiers. While the South Koreans nearly lost the war in just the first few months of battle, the U.S. helped booster their forces and retake their land. The fighting was disasterous for both countries, which eventually agreed to an armistance in July 1953. Since the Korean War is technically ongoing, the U.S. keeps troops in South Korea at the ready. However, the strong U.S. military presence in South Korean has led to negative sentiments from some citizens who oppose reliance on the West. Still, South Korea remains one of the most pro-American populations in the world. According to a 2013 poll, 77 per cent of South Koreans surveyed said they approved of President Obama's leadership.","Ambassador Mark Lippert injured in a surprise attack at a breakfast meeting .

"The jailed Australian wife of a murdered millionaire podiatrist blew kisses to her supporters during a court appearance in the Bahamas. Donna Vasyli, who is charged with stabbing her husband Phillip Vasyli to death at their Caribbean home in the exclusive gated community of Old Fort Bay, told family and friends: ‘I’ll be out.’ Mr Vasyli, 59, also an Australian, was found lifeless in the dining room of the luxury home with multiple stab wounds. During the court hearing on Monday Chief Magistrate Joyann Ferguson-Pratt told Vasyli, 54, she was ‘not required to enter a plea in this matter’. Flanked by security personnel, Donna Vasyli is taken to court in the Bahamas where she was later accused of her husband Philip's murder . Phillip Vasyli was found with seven stab wounds in his body inside his gated community home in the Bahamas . ‘It is claimed that you, on Tuesday, February 24, at New Providence, by means of unlawful harm, did intentionally cause the death of Phillip Vasyli,’ Chief Magistrate Ferguson-Pratt said, The Bahamas' Tribune newspaper reported. The judge denied Vasyli bail and scheduled her to reappear in the court on May 20, but she could apply to the Supreme Court for bail. Mr Vasyli was the owner of multiple podiatry clinics around the world and also founded an orthotic footwear company that sells Vionic with Orthaheel Technology products. Ms Vasyli has been in custody since the body of her husband was found with numerous stab wounds in the couple's luxury home just west of Nassau, the Bahamas' capital. Donna Vasyli (pictured far right) has two children with Mr Vasyli, including daughter Lauren (pictured far left) Donna Vasyli (third from right) helps her husband run his not-for-profit organisation, Vasyli Foundation . Local police said the married father-of-two had been dead for seven hours before a worker found him. Detectives originally took Ms Vasyli into custody following the discovery, saying she was a person of interest in the investigation. She is now said to have hired the legal services of high profile local lawyers Elliot Lockhart QC and Murrio Ducille. Bahamian newspaper The Tribune's website includes video footage showing a handcuffed Donna Vasyli apparently arriving at court flanked by security personnel. Police removed the 59-year-old's body from his house last Tuesday morning as his wife was questioned . It is believed Mr Vasyli owned two houses in the Old Fort Bay area inside the gated community . Mr Vasyli established three podiatry clinics in Sydney and later founded an orthotic footwear company that sells products in the US, the UK and elsewhere. He set up his first practice in western Sydney and had lived in the Bahamas with his wife and two children for at least 15 years. In his 30-year career, Mr Vasyli has treated more than 50,000 people and established three Sydney practices, according to his website. He has since sold the businesses. The range includes over-the-counter orthotic footbeds, slippers, sandals and walking shoes. A friend left a heartfelt tribute to Mr Vasyli on his Facebook page. The podiatrist had 30 years' experience and had started up three practices in Sydney . Mr Vasyli started up a brand of orthapedic shoes. The range includes  footbeds, slippers, sandals and walking shoes . Local police found his body seven hours after he had died about 8am local time on Tuesday . Mr Vasyli moved to the Bahamas from Sydney and set up a practice at a nearby medical centre . The 59-year-old was found inside his Old Fort Bay home, which was inside an exclusive gated community . The podiatrist would share idyllic pictures of his home on social media . This photo was taken from inside Mr Vasyli's home on Old Fort Bay island . 'RIP Phil, It's comforting to know you are finding peace with the Angels [sic]. You will be missed,' she said. Another woman wrote: 'Devastated to hear of Phil's passing. I'm an old school friend. Praying for comfort for his family. RIP Phil.' Donna Vasyli is the mother of Mr Vasyli's two children, Aron and Lauren. The podiatrist's not-for-profit organisation provides health support to third world countries and Ms Vasyli is a 'kind soul and bright spirit', according to its website. She was a dental technician in Sydney before she met her husband. The mother-of-two works for the Vasyli Foundation, alongside her children. The Sydney man lived in the beautiful beach paradise with his wife for 15 years . A friend of the podiatrist left a heartfelt tribute on his Facebook page following his death .

"Annie Ramsay, 8, was walking to the park with friends when she was attacked by a dog last week . An eight-year-old girl has been left eating through a syringe after she was attacked by a springer spaniel that tore a centimetre off her lip and bit through her cheek. Annie Ramsay was walking with her friends  near her home in Whittle-le-Woods, Lancashire, on Thursday when she bent down to stroke the dog as it made its way out of a park with its owner. Her friend stroked the animal first before Annie did the same but the spaniel, which was known to her, licked her face then sank its teeth into her cheek - puncturing her. She ran back home with blood pouring down her face screaming 'I'm going to die' as her horrified father, John, 47, called for an ambulance. Annie was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery, where doctors used the inside or her lip to rebuild the part that had been torn off. She spent three days being treated before she was allowed back home on Sunday, where she is still recovering. The attack has left her unable to eat and her mother Rebecca Ramsay, 34, has to blend her food and feed it to her through a straw or with a syringe. Mrs Ramsay, who has two older sons, Steven, 14, and Josh, 12, said: 'I was heartbroken when I saw her. It's just awful. 'She was petrified but she's been so brave and we're really proud of her. She's a huge dog lover and so sweet with animals so it was a big shock to her. 'The first day after the attack we couldn't even mention the word ""dog"" around her - she was hysterical. 'But I've been trying to explain to her that you get good dogs and bad dogs because I don't want her to be frightened of them but at the same time part of me never wants her to go near one again.' The schoolgirl had bent down to stroke the dog when it sunk its teeth into her cheek and tore a centimetre of skin from her lip. SHe was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery to fix the damage . The family was struck by tragedy in 2011 when Annie's older brother, Dylan, drowned while swimming in a quarry near their home. 'Since his death I have been campaigning around schools about safety and that's where I was at when Annie was attacked,' said Mrs Ramsay. Annie, who has since returned home to recover, is likely to have a hairline scar as a result of the attack . 'She had been out playing with friends and the owner, who she knows and lives on our road, was coming out of the park and she stroked it like she has done several times before. 'It liked her face and that's when it bit into her cheek and took about a centimetre off her lip. She ran home screaming and my husband shouted for a neighbour to call the ambulance. 'Her brothers were terrified, especially after losing Dylan so recently, about what would happen to their sister. 'I rushed to the hospital as soon as I heard and I couldn't believe it when I saw her. But the doctors are hopeful and we have to share their enthusiasm that she will be okay.' Annie is recovering at home and was even strong enough to make it to a party on Sunday where she met 'Olaf' from Frozen. 'She's in a lot of pain and on lots of antibiotics but she's in really good spirits,' she added. It's likely she will be left with a hairline scar on her face, but her eye is expected to return fully to normal. Lancashire Constabulary confirmed that a warrant under the dangerous dogs act was executed and the dog seized. It remains in kennels and an investigation is under way, which will involve speaking to the victim any witnesses and the dog's owner. Mrs Ramsay, whose own dog - a Staffie cross - died recently, said: 'The police are carrying out interviews and will need to speak to Annie in-depth before anything is done. 'There were lots of witnesses too so I think they need to speak to them as well. We're not sure what is going to happen to the dog but it should be put down after what it's done to my daughter.'","Annie Ramsay was walking with friends when she was attacked by dog .

"British mother Pauline Alpin has not heard from her daughter Emma Venier (pictured) since she prepared to face Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu . An anxious British mother has not heard from her 18-year-old daughter for five days after Cyclone Pam struck the Oceania island of Vanuatu. Pauline Alpin, 54, said she last received a text message from her daughter Emma Venier - a former head girl at Norwich High School - as she prepared to face Cyclone Pam before it ripped across the tiny island. The storm has killed at least 24 people and left more than 3,300 homeless in the South Pacific island. Ms Alpin, from Norwich, said: 'I have to assume that Emma is OK because I don't want to think anything else. 'She let me know that they were boarding up windows and were on red alert. 'As the days go on I'm just getting worse and worse. I should be at work but I can't go because I just can't concentrate.' Miss Vernier flew out to Vanuatu, about 1,250 miles from Brisbane, Australia, last month to take part in a volunteering project in Ambae, one of the little nation's outer islets. She was due to remain in Vanuatu until July. The area was ravaged over the weekend by the cyclone as raging 185mph winds destroyed homes, boats, roads and bridges and wrecked power and phone lines. The remote outer islands are not thought to have been as badly hit as the central areas and Vanuatu's capital Port Vila but radio and phone lines were still down last night. Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 people spread over more than 80 islands. About 47,000 people live in the capital. Miss Vernier flew out to Vanuatu, about 1,250 miles from Brisbane, Australia, last month to take part in a volunteering project in Ambae, one of the little nation's outer islets . Cyclone Pam has destroyed or damaged 90 per cent of the buildings in Vanuatu's capital of Port Vila . This photo taken today shows the widespread devastation caused by the cyclone which struck on Saturday . A boy called Samuel kicks a ball as his father searches through the ruins of their Port Vila home . Vanuatu was in the path of the category five storm when it unexpectedly changed direction . A family who lost their home in the cyclone carry their belongings on the outskirts of Port Vila . The tiny village of Yaohnanen on the southern Vanuatu island of Tanna - where Prince Philip is a divine being - has been 'totally devastated' by the cyclone. Villagers have revered the Duke of Edinburgh after catching a glimpse of him standing on a ship during a royal visit to Vanuatu - known then as the New Hebrides - in the 1970s. In his fine white naval uniform Prince Philip looked like a Deity and so he was 'adopted' as the tribe's personal god. The village, of about 200 people, consisted of little more than wooden huts with thatched roofs - and it was in one of these flimsy dwellings that historic signed photographs, personally sent to the tribe in the 1970s, were being held. Rina George, who has relatives living on the hillside where the village is located, said: 'From what we have heard, everything has been smashed down. Very little has been left.' Ms Alpin, a sonographer, said that she was keeping in contact with the parents of other volunteers that her daughter travelled with. 'We are all as worried as each other. They are so young - one of the other girls is 17 and Emma is only 18', she said. 'They might not even have any idea how bad things are as the lines are all down. 'It has been so sad - people have lost their homes and places are devastated, they need so much help.' Vanuatu's president Baldwin Lonsdale said the storm had 'wiped out' all recent development and his country - one of the world's poorest - and it would have to rebuild 'everything'. He estimated the 'monster' had destroyed or damaged 90 per cent of the buildings in the capital of Port Vila. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are in close contact with the local authorities in Vanuatu. 'We have not yet been asked but we stand ready to provide consular assistance to any British people who need our help. 'Any British person who has been affected by the cyclone can get in touch with us on 020 7008 1500.' A massive international relief effort, involving the Red Cross and UNICEF, has been launched as Vanuatu struggles to get back on its feet.

"A 71-year-old artist from Connecticut was shot to death Tuesday at the hands of her husband, who then turned the gun on himself, according to police. Terry Oakes Bourret was discovered dead from a gunshot wound to the head inside the Durham home she shared with her husband, 74-year-old Donald Bourret, who was also found unresponsive. The couple's pet dog had been shot to death outside the house. Double tragedy: Police in Connecticut say Donald Bourret (left), 74, shot dead his wife, local artist Terry Oakes Bourret (pictured right with her dog Murphy), 71, and their pet before turning the gun on himself . What lies beneath: The elderly married couple were found suffering from fatal gunshot wounds to the head in their Durham, Connecticut, home Tuesday . The medical examiner's office ruled Oakes Bourret's death a homicide and that of her husband a suicide, reported WFSB. State troopers responded to the Bourrets' home at 73 Main Street in Durham at around 7.30pm Tuesday after getting a 911 call about two bodies found inside the residence. Career change: The 71-year-old retired nurse took up painting full time about 30 years ago and set up a studio at the back of her house . Oakes Bourret was a retired nurse-turned painter and art teacher whose works have been exhibited throughout Connecticut. The 71-year-artist took up painting full time about 30 years ago and set up a studio at the back of her house, where students of all ages would come for classes. Her artworks, 300 of them displayed on her website, depict bright and cheerful landscapes, everyday scenes from around Durham, florals and pets. Last year, she won the Connecticut Plein Air Painters Society Gold Medal for a painting titled Sidewalk, adding to her collection of some 100 awards, according to Durham Town Times. Hartford Courant reported Donald Bourret was a retiree who wrote a movie review column for the Durham Library. His final review was of the critically acclaimed thriller Nightcrawler starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a sociopathic cameraman obsessed with grisly crimes. Friends and neighbors of the couple were shocked by the murder-suicide. The Bourrets were universally described as a lovely couple who were active in the social life of their town.","Donald Bourret, 74, shot dead his wife, Terry Oakes Bourret, 71, and their dog before turning the gun on himself .

"Seven-year-old Faith Lennox never thought she needed a left hand; after all, she couldn't remember losing hers when she was only 9 months old. The 7-year-old,  grabbed the replacement as soon as it came off a 3-D printer on Tuesday in Los Alamitos, California. She put it on and raced off on her bicycle. Later, Faith happily showed off the hand to others, flexing its pink and blue fingers as she gripped her small, stuffed 'Finding Nemo' fish. The prosthetic was constructed overnight at the Build It Workspace studio. It represents a breakthrough in small, lightweight hands that are economical and easy for children to use. Scroll down for video . She doesn't need any help: Faith Lennox, 7, right, smiles as she holds an extra plastic prosthetics part with her newly 3-D printed hand at the Build it Workspace in Los Alamitos, California on Tuesday . A new addition: Faith Lennox, 7, adjusts her newly 3-D printed hand which is the result of an emerging technology that is revolutionizing prosthetics . But when it came to getting one custom made in a day by a 3-D printer, that was a different story. Particularly when she got to pick the colors — her favorite pink, blue and purple, like the ones on the tank top she was wearing. It didn't hurt, either, that the appendage, called a robohand, looks a lot like the pair Marvel superhero Iron Man wears. 'It's really cool!' the otherwise shy little girl said with an exuberant grin as she stood surrounded by high-tech computers in the Build It Workspace in this Orange County suburb on Monday. Build It Workspace is a 3-D printer studio that teaches people to use high-tech printers and provides access to them for projects. It also does commercial printing. She had gotten out of school early to go there with her mother, Nicole, to watch in fascination as her new hand began to take shape. She stood for several minutes transfixed as it slowly moved from computer image to hard-plastic reality. The finished product will be the result of an emerging technology that is revolutionizing prosthetics, said Build It's Mark Lengsfeld, especially for children like Faith, who quickly outgrow expensive prosthetic limbs and have trouble even using them because of their size and weight. Many functions: Faith Lennox, 7, rides her bicycle with her newly 3D printed hand outside the Build it Workspace parking lot  on Tuesday . Cool tricks: Greg Lennox holds a 'Nemo' plastic fish as his daughter Faith grabs it with her newly 3-D printed hand as her mother, Nicole and Build it Workspace president, Mark Lengsfeld, looks on . 'It's an amazing thing to be doing,' the company's president and founder said of making a hand that weighs less than a pound out of the same kind of plastic used in automobile parts. Although Lengsfeld's company has printed out everything from pumps for oil and gas companies to parts for unmanned aerial vehicles, this is the first hand he and his three employees have built. Airwolf 3D, whose printers built Faith's hand, recently cranked out 200 hands for children around the world as part of an international competition to see which company could use the most 3-D printers in one space at one time. Airwolf, with 159 printers going, won by one, said the company's creative director, Tyler Caros, who was keeping watch on Monday as the hard plastic going into Faith's hand slowly unspooled. In love with her hand: Faith Lennox, 7, left, forms a heart with her newly 3D printed hand on Tuesday . Going for a ride: Faith Lennox, 7, adjusts her helmet before riding her bicycle with her newly 3D printed hand outside Build it Workspace in Los Alamitos, California . The oldest of three children, Faith had compartment syndrome when her position during childbirth cut off the flow of blood to her left forearm, irreparably damaging tissue, muscle and bone. After nine months of trying to save the limb, doctors determined they had to amputate just below the elbow. Faith's parents were working with the nonprofit group E-Nable to get her a 3-D-printed hand, but the technology is so new there's a waiting list, her mother said. Then she learned of what Lengsfeld's company could do from a friend whose son visited with his Scout troop. E-Nable provides open-source technology for building the hand, Lengsfeld said, making it economical for anyone with the right printer and a set of instructions to create one. Faith's only costs $50, and when she outgrows it she can easily build a bigger replacement. 'It's been an honor to help her,' he said. The little girl who taught herself to swim at age 3 and surfs with her father already knows what she plans to do when she puts that new hand on. 'Ride my bike!'she said with a big grin. Although she's already a competent rider, she noted that making turns with just one hand can be a little tricky.

"Doctors warned that taking the contraceptive Pill triples the risk of developing an incurable disease of the digestive system . Taking the contraceptive Pill triples the risk of developing an incurable disease of the digestive system, doctors warned last night. Cases of Crohn’s disease have exploded since the 1960s, and researchers now believe widespread use of the Pill may be one of the main reasons behind the dramatic rise. They have found sex hormones in contraceptive Pills can weaken the gut, creating the perfect conditions for Crohn’s to develop. The doctors also fear that repeated use of the ‘morning-after pill’ – which contains even higher doses of sex hormones than the daily tablet – might make women still more prone to it. Crohn’s involves the painful inflammation of the digestive system, most commonly the intestines. This makes digesting food difficult, resulting in diarrhoea, fatigue and anaemia. Flare-ups can be so bad that working is impossible, leading to lengthy periods off work. Drugs and surgery can help ease symptoms, but there is no cure, and some sufferers find it so intolerable that they commit suicide. At least two Britons with Crohn’s have travelled to Switzerland to end their lives at the controversial Dignitas clinic. Dr Hamed Khalili, a Harvard gastroenterologist, said Crohn’s cases had risen ‘two or three-fold’ in the past 50 years, since widespread use of the Pill began. It now affects an estimated 100,000 people in Britain – one in every 650 people – although only a fraction of these are officially diagnosed. Changing diets had been touted as a reason for the increase, but Dr Khalili said research into the suspected link had been ‘fairly disappointing’. However, a study of 230,000 American women led by Dr Khalili found the risk was three times higher in women who had used the Pill for five years or more than those who had never been on it. A British study came to a similar conclusion. Exactly why the Pill – taken by around 3.5 million women in Britain, a third of those of childbearing age – seems to raise the risk of Crohn’s remains unclear. But Dr Khalili said changing a woman’s natural sex hormone levels appeared to do three things that could put them at greater risk: it made the gut lining more permeable, reduced levels of ‘friendly’ bacteria in the intestines and affected the immune system. He added he would expect the morning-after pill to increase the risk further, because it contained higher levels of hormones but said there was no hard data yet to back up that hypothesis. Overall, adult women are only a little more likely to have Crohn’s than adult men. But twice as many women as men suffer from one of the main forms of Crohn’s, where the colon is affected. Dr Khalili, who practises at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, stressed a woman was unlikely to get Crohn’s simply by using the Pill, and that genetics played a large role. He said: ‘What’s very clear is that Crohn’s is not caused by oral contraceptive use by itself. It’s a combination of oral contraceptive use among individuals with a strong genetic predisposition to Crohn’s. ‘It’s an interaction between these two that significantly increases the risk of an individual developing it.’ Cases of Crohn’s disease have exploded since the 1960s, and researchers now believe widespread use of the Pill may be one of the main reasons behind the dramatic rise . It was ‘not far-fetched’ to imagine that women will soon be warned not to go on the Pill if they carry certain high-risk genes, he said. Dr Khalili and his colleagues are now looking at this in a study of 1,500 women, a third of whom have Crohn’s. Dr Simon Anderson, a consultant gastroenterologist at London Bridge hospital, said the Pill appeared to act as a ‘trigger’ to developing Crohn’s. He cautioned: ‘If you have a family history of Crohn’s, I would advise against starting on the Pill.’ But he said those without such a family history should not be unduly concerned. ‘You are tripling the risk, but from a low base,’ he explained. ‘Crohn’s is not a particularly common disease.’ Crohn's disease is a painful condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system. Around one in 10,000 people are diagnosed every year with 115,000 current sufferers in the UK. Crohn's disease is one of the two main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).The other common form of IBD is Ulcerative Colitis. It is described as chronic, meaning it is a life-long condition, and can cause redness, swelling and pain. Sufferers will have periods of good health, remission, as well as times when their symptoms flare up or relapse. There is currently no cure for the disease, but drugs and surgery can give patients long periods of relief from their symptoms. Last year a bikini selfie of Crohn's disease sufferer and aspiring model Bethany Townsend, pictured with two of her colostomy bags visible went viral . The cause of Crohn's disease is not well understood. Experts believe the condition is, in part, inherited, while an abnormal reaction of the immune system to certain bacteria in the intestines is thought to contribute. Viruses, bacteria, diet, smoking and stress have all been suggested as environmental triggers, but there is no definitive evidence that any one of these is a cause of Crohn's. Crohn's causes ulcers to form in the gut and inflammation that affects the body's ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste in a healthy way. Symptoms include: . Abdominal pain and diarrhoea . Tiredness and fatigue . Feeling generally unwell . Mouth ulcers . Loss of appetite and weight loss . Anaemia - a reduced level of red blood cells . The disease can cause complications including perforations. They happen when a severe blockage ruptures the bowel, making a hole. The contents of the bowel can leak through and form an abscess. It causes pain and a fever . Junk food and antibiotics are have also been blamed by doctors for the rise in the number of young people developing a serious digestive disorder. Crohn's has a number of high-profile sufferers including Towie's Sam Faiers who was rushed to hospital in 2013 while she was a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother suffering 'agonising cramps'. Shortly after the show she was diagnosed with the disease. Last year a bikini selfie of Crohn's disease sufferer and aspiring model Bethany Townsend, pictured with two of her colostomy bags visible went viral.

"The latest twist in the alleged cover-up of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's private emails involves a former senior diplomat who said State Department officials conspired to prevent investigators from seeing documents related to the 2012 Benghazi, Libya terror attack. Some of those documents may have been emails that went through the now-infamous private email server Clinton kept at her Chappaqua, New York home. If they still exist, they could shed light on Clinton's actions following the deadly Benghazi raid by militants acting with Ansar al-Shariah, an Islamist terror faction linked to al-Qaeda. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three security personnel perished in a hail of gunfire, grenades and mortars. Scroll down for videos . WHISTLE-BLOWER: Raymond Maxwell was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern affairs when al-Qaeda-linked militants stormed a US diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya and killed four Americans . GATEKEEPER: Clinton's then-State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills (left) was accused of setting up a secret operation to segregate Benghazi-related materials that might make Hillary look bad . 'What difference, at this point, does it make?' Clinton famously snapped in a 2013 Senate hearing when confronted with the tall tale that an anti-Islam YouTube video, not a terror plot, sparked the Benghazi death and destruction in Sept. 11, 2012 . Raymond Maxwell, a former deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, last year told The Daily Signal, a news outlet operated by the conservative Heritage Foundation, that a room in the basement of the State Department was converted to a makeshift document review center on a weekend, supervised by Clinton confidantes including some linked to then-chief of staff Cheryl Mills. Maxwell claimed he was scapegoated for objecting to the secret boiler-room operation, which he said was organized in order to keep damning documents from the prying eyes of an internal Accountability Review Board. On a weekend in a basement room, Maxwell recalled to Daily Signal journalist Sharyl Attkisson, employees were instructed to sift through boxes of documents and separate out anything that might make Clinton or her close associates look bad in the wake of the terrorist murders of four Americans including the ambassador to Libya. 'I was not invited to that after-hours endeavor, but I heard about it and decided to check it out on a Sunday afternoon,' Maxwell said. Inside, says Maxwell, employees – including an employee who reported to him – were busily covering up information that suggested higher-ups were responsible for the lax security at the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. ICONIC OR IRONIC? The image of Clinton working her Blackberry while on a plane en route to Tripoli, Libya took on new significance with her admission that she never used a 'state.gov' email account, one that would have automatically archived all her correspondence . Maxwell claimed State Department higher-ups close to then-Secretary Hillary Clinton worked over a weekend to scrub boxes of documents , before giving the remainder to investigators . A senior adviserto Clinton's office explained the operation to him. 'She told me, ""Ray, we are to go through these stacks and pull out anything that might put anybody in the [Near Eastern Affairs] front office or the seventh floor in a bad light"",' Maxwell remembered. The seventh floor of the State Department is the showplace level that houses Clinton's office and those of her closest aides. 'I asked her, ""But isn’t that unethical?"" Maxwell said. 'She responded, ""Ray, those are our orders"",' Minutes later, he said, Mills came into the room and demanded to know, 'Who are you?' ULTIMATE INSIDER: Cheryl Mills has been part of the Clinton inner circle since the 1990s, defending Bill Clinton against impeachment proceedings and even the 'bimbo eruptions' that once threatened to derail the famous womanizer's presidential ambitions . A month after the deadly military-style assault, the Accountability Review Board's leaders demanded to see documents that could help explain what happened. Top officials in the of the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs were instructed to gather anything and everything that could help. Those were the documents, Maxwell told The Daily Signal, that were boxed up and put in the basement room where Clinton insiders would later screen out the most damaging information before giving the ARB the rest. The current controversy over Clinton's emails – she exclusively used a private address instead of one hosted at 'state.gov' – now suggests that emails to and from Clinton may have been among them. Clinton conceded last week that she deleted more than 30,000 of those emails, calling them 'personal' and not 'work-related.' Her attorney claimed Sunday that every deleted email was reviewed by someone. South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, who chairs a special congressional committee tasked with investigating the Benghazi attacks, insists that Clinton and her inner circle can't be trusted to vet the material on their own. National Review linked the Maxwell episode with Clinton's 'email-gate' on Monday, noting that Mills – along with Clinton deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin – had email addresses on Clinton's private server. DEVIL HORNS: Hillary Clinton's reputation has taken a hit over her handling of emails during her tenure as America's top diplomat – leading to more chuckles than outrage at the inadvertent Beelzebub treatment on a TIME magazine cover . Trey Gowdy, a South Caroline Republican congressman at the helm of a special Benghazi investigative committee, is outraged that Clinton and her insiders took it upon themselves to decide which emails were turned over to the State Department for archiving . Maxwell called the review board investigation 'at best a shoddily executed attempt at damage control, both in Foggy Bottom and on Capitol Hill.' State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach has called his accusations 'totally without merit.' Foggy Bottom is the Washington, D.C. neighborhood that hosts the State Department's sprawling headquarters. Ultimately, State's review board cleared Clinton of any wrongdoing, perhaps aided by the absence of incriminating emails – even though it never interviewed her. The September 11 attack more than two years ago followed a separate bombing of the facility's outer wall four months earlier that left a giant hole. Days later, Ansar al-Shariah held two days of open-air rallies and parades including 30 fighting battalions in the city's main square. Speakers at the event warned of 'assassinations' that would come. Clinton – the Democratic Party's front-runner in the 2016 presidential sweepstakes – and others at State have been criticized for denying repeated requests from Ambassador Chris Stevens for more security officers, including some that came after these events. . Ansar al-Shariah, the terrorist group that laid waste to the US diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, held two days of threatening parades and rallies a few months earlier and called for 'assassinations' -- leading to questions about why security at the compound was lacking . Maxwell was one of four officials officially saddled with the blame. He was later cleared of wrongdoing. He was, however, placed on indefinite leave, with pay, while the State Department investigated. Struggling to clear his name, Maxwell met with an agency ombudsman who he says told him, 'You are taking this all too personally, Raymond. ... It’s not about you; it’s about Hillary and 2016.' Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, whose organization has dented the Obama administration's Benghazi armor with a series of Freedom Of Information Act lawsuits, told MailOnline that 'Maxwell’s disclosures are no surprise to those of us who know the Clintons' penchant for illicit secrecy.' 'The Benghazi cover-up was and is about protecting two presidential campaigns – Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign and Hillary’s nascent 2016 campaign,' Fitton said. 'Our Ambassador and three other American personnel die in a terrorist attack and the number one concern at State is protecting Hillary Clinton! First we have the supposedly missing IRS emails and now we may have missing Benghazi documents?' In May 2013 The Daily Beast interviewed American Foreign Service Association president Susan Johnson, who said disciplinary action meted out to diplomats like Maxwell creates 'a feeling that foreign-service officers often end up as scapegoats when scandals rise to congressional or public attention.'","An Accountability Review Board demanded documents related to the 2012 Benghazi terror attack but  important details were kept from them .

"A teenager took pictures of a schoolgirl as she was raped by a friend of an Asian restaurant owner Mohammed Khubaib (pictured), it has been claimed . A teenager took pictures of a schoolgirl as she was raped by a friend of an Asian restaurant owner who allegedly groomed young girls for sex, a court heard. The alleged victim had just turned 16 when she was photographed having sex with Manase Motaung, 32, at a drinking session in Peterborough. Motaung has been accused along with businessman Mohammed Khubaib, 43, of raping and trafficking young girls as young as 12. A friend of the 16-year-old girl, who cannot be named, said she was not concerned after seeing the girl have sex with Motaung and took three photographs on her mobile phone. She even sent one picture to her sister, a jury at the Old Bailey heard. But her 'distraught' friend has claimed she was so drunk she had no memory of the alleged attack and it was only as the months passed that she started to have 'flashbacks' of what happened. She insisted she would never willingly have sex with the two 'vile men' when questioned by defence barrister, Karim Khalil QC. Cross-examining the alleged victim's friend, Mr Khalil said: 'You took a picture, the flash goes off. [She] realised you had taken a photo and was not happy about that. 'The two go upstairs and you send the photo to your sister. It was a big joke.' The witness agreed she believed her friend had consented to sex with Motaung, who denies rape. Letting agent Khubaib, who also owned Peterborough's 'Zaika' restaurant, is accused of grooming young girls to be used for sex by him and his friends. The prosecution allege he enticed vulnerable girls as young as 12 into spending time with him by giving them cash, tobacco, McDonald's meals and even flowers. Pakistani-born Khubaib who owns Peterborough restaurant Zaika (pictured), is accused of driving the vulnerable girls to properties around Cambridgeshire where they were plied with alcohol . The court heard Khubaib (pictured) bought one girl a £40 bunch of flowers for her 15th birthday . Khubaib allegedly drove the youngsters to properties around Cambridgeshire where they were plied with booze. The girls would then be used for the sexual pleasure and satisfaction of himself and any other adult who was with him, it is claimed. Khubaib from Peterborough has denied 11 counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation, and one count of rape. Motaung, also from Peterborough, has denied seven counts of trafficking a child for sexual exploitation and one charge of rape. The offences were allegedly committed between 2007 and 2013. Khubaib was arrested alongside Motaung, known as 'Naz' and a 27-year-old friend at a house in  Peterborough on 27 January, 2013. The men had been giving vodka to two 14-year-old girls in an upstairs bedroom and were playing videos, which appeared to contain 'porn-style scenes', jurors heard at an earlier hearing. The court heard it was the third time that week that Khubaib had been caught in the company of teenagers in similar circumstances. Khubaib first came to the attention of police as far back as August 2007, when he is alleged to have forced a 14-year-old to engage in oral sex, the court heard. Her friend accepted just £5 for her to do so, but when the girl, who cannot be named, refused he forced her to perform the sex act on him, it is claimed. The trial continues.

"The US teenager accused in the 'body in the suitcase' murder in Bali has given birth by cesarean operation after being rushed to hospital when she went into labor. Heather Mack, 19, was taken to hospital from Kerobokan Prison when she started to have contractions, guards confirmed. The baby, whom Mack said earlier would be named Stella, weighs 6.1 pounds. One of her attorneys, Anthony Scifo, said Mack gave birth by cesarean and she and the baby, named Stella, are healthy. Scroll down for video . Break down: Heather Mack, from Chicago, weeps in a courtroom as she witnesses her trial in Bali, Indonesia on Thursday, March 12. Mack, 19, charged with premeditated murder in the death of her mother . The hospital where Heather Mack was rushed to when she went into labour earlier today . Mack, 19, was taken to hospital from Kerobokan Prison when she started to have contractions . The pair (pictured together), from Chicago, Illinois, are being tried separately by the Denpasar District Court . Mack had the baby in the Wings Amerta building of the Sanglah Hospital. Mack had earlier told friends who have been supporting her during jail visits that she was expecting her baby in April. This means the child was born prematurely - but it is not known how long she expects to remain in hospital. It is likely that her scheduled court appearance next week will be adjourned, allowing her time to recover from the birth. A friend who accompanied her to the hospital told nursing staff that Mack will be taking the baby back to the prison with her. Bali pirson rules allow prisoners to keep their babies until the age of two. Mack has said she wants the baby to stay in Bali so she can visit her while in jail. It means that within the first few hours of her life, the baby will be a prisoner, locked in behind bars with her teenage mother. A photographer who was at the hospital said he was able, for a short time, to look into a room where Mack was being prepared for the birth of her first child, fathered, she has earlier revealed, by boyfriend Tommy Schaefer. The photographer said he saw an intravenous drip being prepared by a nurse and a doctor standing nearby. Heavily pregnant Mack (right), 19, and Tommy Schaefer (second from left), 21, sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of von Wiese-Mack . Sheila Von Wiese-Mack's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel . There was speculation that if judges in her trial decide that the proceedings should continue next week, Mack will take the baby to court with her. Unless he is granted special privileges, that might be the first time that Schaefer lays eyes on his baby daughter. Mack and  Schaefer, 21, are being tried separately by Denpasar District Court, where they are charged with premeditated murder of her mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack. They could face a firing squad if found guilty. Last week  Schaefer told the trial that he had been attacked by Wiese-Mack and called a racially offensive name. He said that his relationship with Heather was not endorsed by her mother and he went to Bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant. After meeting with Mack at the hotel, they discussed how to inform von Wiese-Mack that Mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where Mack and her mother were staying. Speaking through an interpreter, Schaefer said Mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl, which he hid under his shirt as a 'precaution'. Asked by a judge why it was hidden, Schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself. According to Schaefer, he arrived in the room and found Mack weeping. He did not know why, but also saw that Mack's mother was screaming. 'She (von Wiese-Mack) was angry at me when she knew that Heather was pregnant,' Schaefer said, while trying to hold back tears. Mack, who was sitting beside her lawyer, sobbed at the testimony. He said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man. He said the situation got heated when von Wiese-Mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby. Schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which von Wiese-Mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds. 'I was angry, I took the fruit bowl and hit her,' Schaefer said, in tears. He added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim. After acknowledging she wasn't breathing, he tried to give her artificial respiration, while Mack, who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes, came back and tried to revive her mother. He said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the United States. 'Troubled': Mack has previously been described as 'troubled' and 'violent' by friends of her family . Heather Mack (left) and boyfriend Tommy Schaefer (right) arrive in court Thursday in Bali . In her first questioning in court on Wednesday, Mack, who is eight months' pregnant, said Schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von Wiese-Mack made the threat in an argument. 'The blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting,' Mack said. 'I asked Tommy to stop and then I ran into the bathroom.' Von Wiese-Mack's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets. The suitcase was later found in a taxi at the posh St. Regis Hotel in August. In February a health scare saw Mack rushed to hospital after she collapsed with stomach pain and started bleeding. She was taken to Bali's Sanglah Hospital, the main medical centre in Denpasar, where tourists and other foreigners are usually treated. Hospital officials later said Miss Mack's baby was safe but she had been taken to hospital for an immediate check-up because she was in pain and had lost blood. In January Mack had said she vowed to bring the baby up in the cramped Bali prison she shares with six others. She has told fellow prisoners in the Wijaya Kusuma cell block of her intentions - but that has not gone down well with several of the other women. 'Make arrangements to get your baby out of here,' one prisoner is reported to have angrily told her. 'We're fed up with being woken by crying babies.' In an adjoining cell a prisoner in her late 30s is raising a baby which cries through the night, waking other inmates. 'This is what your baby is going to be doing - waking us up - and we don't want that,' Heather was told by one woman - according to visitors leaving the prison on Friday after delivering food to relatives in the women's section of the notorious prison.

"A toddler has been dubbed the real-life Elsa from the Disney film Frozen because she faces a daily battle to keep warm. Gracie Hughes, two, suffers from Raynaud's syndrome, and turns blue when she is exposed to the cold. The condition occurs when small blood vessels in the extremities are over-sensitive to changes in temperature, interrupting the blood supply. During an attack, the extremities become first white and dead looking and may then turn blue and finally red and burning when the blood flow is restored. The condition can cause considerable pain, numbness or tingling. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old Gracie Hughes (with her mother Laurie) suffers from Raynaud's syndrome, which means she turns blue when she is exposed to the cold . Raynaud's occurs when small blood vessels in the extremities are over-sensitive to changes in temperature, interrupting the blood supply. Gracie is so badly affected she has been given special gloves for extra protection . During an attack, the extremities become first white and dead looking and may then turn blue and finally red and burning when the blood flow is restored . Most patients can cope by wrapping up warm, although some develop painful weeping ulcers, which can become infected. Gracie is so badly affected she has been given special gloves for extra protection. Her mother Laurie, 27, said: 'When she gets cold, she turns blotchy blue. It starts in her hands then travels up her arms, feet, legs then face. 'She has magic gloves which reflect 95 per cent of the heat back into her body.' Gracie's condition means even normal activities such as going outside can become a challenge, and she is not allowed to eat ice cream or consume very cold drinks. She doesn't leave the house without dressing in thermals, several layers, two pairs of socks and a hat and scarf - as well as her  silver gloves. 'The winter months are awful,' said her mother, who takes Gracie's temperature three times a day to check it doesn't drop too low. 'She can't go outside to play and now she is older can't eat ice cream or cold foods because her hands swell when she handles cold things. 'My heating is constantly on, and I have got her a heated blanket that I plug into the cigarette lighter which helps to keep her warm when we're in the car.' Gracie's condition means even normal activities such as going outside can become a challenge, and she is not allowed to eat ice cream or consume very cold drinks . Her mother said: 'When she gets cold, she turns blotchy blue. It starts in her hands then travels up her arms, feet, legs then face' Gracie also frequently suffers Raynaud's attacks at bath time. Her mother added: 'It's scary. People have stopped me in the street to say she's wrapped up too much and will overheat. 'While I want her to be a ""normal"" child, there are normal things that she just can't do. 'So it's a balance of letting her do all the other things little girls, while I'm permanently worried about her having an attack.' Gracie, from Barry, South Wales, was diagnosed with Raynaud's a year ago when she was 16 months old - despite her mother noticing from birth she was often cold and turning blue. Miss Hughes said: 'The worst I have seen is when her hands went almost black and looked like they were about to drop off. 'I was so worried because I was taking her to the doctor and the hospital but all the tests they were doing were coming back clear. 'They just kept telling me there was nothing wrong but I had a mother's instinct. Gracie is now learning to cope with the condition - helped by snow queen Elsa from the Disney film Frozen. Her mother said: 'Gracie absolutely loves Frozen and when I noticed that she was a bit like Elsa, she thought it was brilliant' Raynaud's condition, triggered by a sudden drop in temperature, causes the blood vessels in the fingers and toes contract, cutting off blood supply. It can also affect the tiny arteries in the nose, ears and tongue. Typically, Raynaud’s causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb. Then, as the blood flow returns, they turn blue and eventually red, accompanied by a burning sensation. Attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour. Nine out of ten cases are in women, with most sufferers having their first attack before the age of 40. Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms can be triggered by everyday tasks such as taking food out of the freezer, air conditioning, or even stress — all of which cause blood vessels to contract. There are two types of Raynaud’s. Primary Raynaud’s, which tends to run in families, is generally quite mild. Most patients can cope by wrapping up warm, although some develop painful weeping ulcers, which can become infected. 'She was finally seen by a rheumatologist at the hospital in Cardiff who told me what it was, which was great.' Gracie is now learning to cope with the condition - helped by snow queen Elsa from the animated film Frozen. Her mother said: 'Gracie absolutely loves Frozen and when I noticed that she was a bit like Elsa, she thought it was brilliant. 'She's getting to the age now where she doesn't understand why she has to wear gloves all the time so I tell her she's like Elsa and Elsa is special, which cheers her up. 'She loves being like Elsa, just like a real-life queen. 'There might be a day where she grows out of it and I hope that when she's older she can go out there and have a normal life. 'In the meantime it's just about teaching her how to deal with it so she can lead as much of a normal life as possible.' Liz Bevins, CEO of the Raynaud's & Scleroderma Association, said: 'Raynaud's can affect anyone of any age - babies, young children, adolescents, mature adults and the elderly. 'Cold hands and feet are frequently overlooked, put up with and considered nothing more than a nuisance but if you do suffer from cold extremities frequently, please don't ignore it. 'Some of the above diseases have silent phases, so you have very few symptoms or know no pain until the disease is in it's later stages. 'A few simple tests may be able to diagnose the above conditions much earlier, so we're encouraging you to go to your local GP and discuss any concerns you have , or get in touch with us for further help . 'Those looking after someone with the condition can also experience distress. We are here to help those people who suffer from the condition but also assist their families and carers to get the help and information they need.'

"From Marlene who requires shots in her eyeballs to Julia who needs an ostomy bag  taped to a hole in her abdomen  - the scenes from this anti-smoking campaign are aimed to make you cringe. The new Tips from Former Smokers ad by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlights two smoking-related conditions macular degeneration, a blinding eye disease, and colorectal cancer. The campaign which originally launched in 2012 will begin running on March 30 featuring five former smokers in a bid to stop people from smoking. Marlene, 68, started smoking when she was 15 years old and now has to have treatments involving shots to her eyeballs . Marlene, 68, of New York began smoking in high school when she was 15, and started losing her vision due to macular degeneration when she was 56 years old. 'Please don't end up like me. Don't sit in a doctor's chair, have a clamp put on your eye, and have needles stuck in your eyeballs. It's horrible,' Marlene told NBC. Apart from quitting smoking, her best chance to slow down her vision loss is a drug that has to be injected through a needle into her eyes. Marlene must get the shots every month which is a stomach-churning process to watch . In the video, the stomach-churning treatment she undergoes every month is revealed just before the needle goes into her eye. So far, she has had more than 100 shots in each eye. 'This will probably go on for the rest of my life,' she said. 'If I'd had a crystal ball many years ago, I would never have put that first cigarette in my mouth.' She added: 'I want to see the sun. I want to see the water. I'm so sorry that I started smoking.' The new Tips from Former Smokers ad by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlights colon cancer, which Julia suffers from . The campaign also features former smokers Mark, 47, of California an Air Force veteran who developed rectal cancer when he was 42. He also has to use an ostomy bag. Julia, 58, of Mississippi smoked for more than 20 years before she developed colon cancer at 49 years old and requires an ostomy bag, while Kristy, 35, of Tennesee smoked until her lung collapsed and was later diagnosed with early COPD, a lung disease. While many of the stories show the heart-breaking aftermath of smoking, some of them have happier endings. Mark, 47, an Air Force veteran who developed rectal cancer when he was 42 and is required to use an ostomy bag . Tiffany, 35, whose mother died from lung cancer when she was 16, decided to stop smoking when her own daughter turned 16 years old. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable illness and death in the United States. It's responsible for the majority of the nation's lung cancer deaths and is a deadly factor in heart attacks and a variety of other illnesses. In 2012, the agency's $54 million campaign was its first and largest national advertising effort. The government deemed it a success: That campaign triggered an increase of 200,000 calls to quit lines. The CDC believes that likely prompted tens of thousands of smokers to quit based on calculations that a certain percentage of callers do actually stop. Like last year, the 20-week campaign spotlights real people who were hurt and disfigured by smoking. She made the decision so that she could be around for the important milestones of her daughter's life. Her ad will run as a public service announcement. 'All the Tips ad participants are heroes,' said Dr. Tim McAfee, director of CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. 'By courageously sharing their painful personal stories, they're inspiring millions of Americans to make the life-saving decision to quit smoking.' The CDC said its campaign has helped prompt millions of smokers to try to quit, and that in 2014 when ads were on air, nearly 80 per cent more contacted the national quitline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW. The campaign in 2013 featured Terrie, a North Carolina woman who lost her voice box, and later died from throat and oral cancer. 'Over a million and a half smokers made a quit attempt because of our 12 week campaign — just a 12-week campaign created this effect,' McAfee told NBC. 'Over a hundred thousand people quit successfully and permanently because of the campaign.' Kristy, 35, smoked cigarettes until her lung collapsed and was diagnosed with early COPD, a lung disease .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Turkish police detained the pair after customs officials made the discovery on Monday, but they were both later released, sent back to Georgia and ordered not to return. The woman told investigators that she had an outstanding ban on her travelling to Turkey after being convicted of an unspecified offence. It was not immediately clear what had attracted customs officials to the 25-year-old Georgian man, but the suitcase in which the woman was hidden was barely large enough to hold a human body. The tight squeeze forced her to curl up into an uncomfortable-looking fetal position. Hidden: The tight squeeze forced her to curl up into an uncomfortable-looking fetal position . The border crossing where the couple had tried to smuggle themselves in Turkey lies near Sarp - a tiny town on the Black Sea, around 50 miles north of the city of Artvin. Although Sarp is home to just 212 people, it is one of only three official border crossings along the 170-mile long Turkey-Georgia border. The Sarp border crossing, in the District of Hopa, Artvin Province, opened in the late 1980s, when Georgia was still part of the Soviet Union. After independence in 1991, post-communist Georgia suffered from civil unrest and economic crisis for most of the 1990s.

"The US Presbyterian Church  has voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples after a decades long debate. The church, which accounts for just under two million members and represents the largest Presbyterian denomination, made the announcement after the majority of its 171 regional governing bodies approved the change. Its revised constitution will now read that marriage is 'a unique commitment between two people, traditionally a man and a woman,' as opposed to just a man and woman previously. Scroll down for video . The Presbyterian Church USA which accounts for just under two million members, voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples ©Alex Wong (Getty Images/AFP/File) 'Finally, the church in its constitutional documents fully recognizes that the love of gays and lesbian couples is worth celebrating in the faith community,' Rev. Brian D. Ellison, executive director of the Covenant Network of Presbyterians, which advocates gay inclusion in the church, told the New York Times. 'There is still disagreement, and I don’t mean to minimize that, but I think we are learning that we can disagree and still be church together.' The new language, which was approved by the church's General Assembly last year, had  to be ratified by more than half its regional bodies. A grouping of congregations in the state of New Jersey became the 86th body to do just that Tuesday. The decision is likely to drive a further wedge between Presbyterian USA members, who have taken opposite sides on the issue. The church has in fact been losing some of its members as it adopts a more liberal stance on social and religious issues. That being said, the fact that some many members who were against same-sex marriage have moved on to other churches made the passage of this new definition far easier for the church. At last year's Presbyterian General Assembly, the church also gave its pastors a green light to marry gay and lesbian couples in states where such marriages are allowed. 'These decisions have been welcomed by some and are a disappointment to others,' Gradye Parsons, stated clerk of the General Assembly, said at the time. The Presbyterians' position stands in sharp contrast to that of the Roman Catholic church, the biggest single denomination among Americans, and fundamentalist Evangelicals who strongly oppose gay marriage. In 2011, the Presbyterian Church USA voted to approve the ordination of openly gay and lesbian clergy. The constitution's new wording will take effect on June 21.","After a debate that has lasted three decades, the US Presbyterian Church has voted to define marriage to include gay and lesbian couples .

"Shoppers could be faced with empty shelves without urgent action to recruit an army of lorry drivers, it was warned today. Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to announce support for training in the haulage industry in the Budget this week, amid warnings of shortage of 45,000 drivers. The crisis in in the industry could mean food shortages at peak times, including this Easter and the summer months. Shoppers could be faced with empty shelves without urgent action to recruit an army of lorry drivers, it was warned today . New training rules mean the logistics industry is thousands of drivers short, according to the UK Commission for Employment and Skills. The Freight Transport Association claims more than 20,000 drivers have quit since September. It comes after a new Driver Certificate of Professional Competence was introduced across the EU, which meant drivers had to complete an extra 35 hours training, costing some £500. Hauliers say the rules mean there are not enough people to drive lorries across the country, raising the prospect of 'empty shelves'. Mr Osborne is being urged to find £150million to increase training for thousands of drivers before the shortages hit vital supplies. A shortage of 45,000 drivers has been caused in part by new rules forcing hauliers to be tested on their driving skills . Richard Burnett, the chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, told the Telegraph: 'We need George Osborne to dig deep and find a way through this. 'The problem isn't going to go away. If it's not tackled in this Budget, then whoever comes in to government are going to have to wake up and recognise that this is a significant issue and it's growing. We've no young people coming through into the industry.' He added: 'There's going to be an impact in terms of getting goods to consumers on time. The expectation in the market is immediate, but we're seeing signs of slowing. We've insufficient drivers to get products there on time. 'That's set to get worse. We will see delivery failure during the peak trading periods. Bank Holiday weekends, during the summer where you see big spikes when the weather starts to improve and there's a massive draw upon driver resource, we're going to see problems — definitely at Christmas this year as we see a further reduction in the number of drivers.' Chancellor George Osborne is being urged to find £150million to increase training for thousands of drivers before the shortages hit vital supplies . Six weeks before Chrismtmas, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin urged people to 'get their shopping done' in case the driver shortage hit the supply of food and presents. He defended the new EU rules, arguing that drivers need to know how to drive their lorries properly. But he urged people not to leave their shopping until the last minute, in case supply lines are affected. 'If you're driving a motor vehicle, with the investment you've got in that motor vehicle, it's no bad thing to know what you're doing,' he told the ConservativeHome website. Asked if there were going to problems with deliveries before Christmas, he replied: 'I hope not. I hope not. I think we'll be all right. But I'd advise everybody to get their shopping done.'","New training rules for drivers have led to thousands quitting the industry .

"A new first-time buyers’ Isa will mean those saving for a deposit will get £50 from the Government for every £200 they put away. The Help to Buy Isa was unveiled by the Chancellor yesterday as a way to help thousands of young people on to the property ladder. Set to be launched by banks and building societies this Autumn, it will give a maximum bonus per saver of up to £3,000. This means that a young couple who jointly save £24,000 could get £6,000 from the Government. Scroll down for video . George Osborne announced a new first-time buyers Isa for those saving for a deposit and looking to get onto the property ladder. It will give them £50 from the Government for every £200 they put away . Groups of friends who buy together would also be able to take out one Isa each and get additional bonuses. The scheme was hailed as a massive boost for first-time buyers, amid claims it could cut the average time taken to save for a deposit by up to a year. David Hollingworth, director at brokers London & Country, said: ‘This is basically free money. ‘It will help combat the issue which really affects first-time buyers who complain that they cannot save as quick as house prices are rising. ‘It is quite a large perk the Government is paying.’ The average UK first-time buyer currently pays around £150,000 for a home, putting down an average deposit of £25,000, according to figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Set to be launched by banks and building societies this Autumn, it will give a maximum bonus per saver of up to £3,000. This means that a young couple who jointly save £24,000 could get £6,000 from the Government . In London, the typical price paid for a first home is £260,000. Last year around 25,000 first-time buyers a month made it on to the property ladder, with an average income of £38,000. However, steep rises in house prices around the country – particularly in London and the South East – mean that it is becoming increasingly difficult for many to save the deposit needed. 76,400 Employment growth in Yorkshire between 2010 and 2013 compared to 66,000 in the whole of France . 2.6% UK growth in 2014 – faster than any other advanced economy including Germany and seven times the level in France . 100,000 Fall in unemployment announced yesterday . 5.3% Expected unemployment rate this year –nearly half the eurozone’s average of 9.8 per cent . 30.94m Number in work – a record . 1.9m Number of jobs created since 2010 . 73.3% Percentage of working age people now in employment – the highest rate since records began . 80% Percentage of jobs created which are full-time . 80% Percentage of jobs created which are skilled . 1,000 Number of jobs created every day . £900 The average amount that households are better off by, compared to 2010 . 0.2% Projected inflation rate this year . £1,000 Interest people will now be able to earn on their savings tax-free . £50 Top-up given to the savings of first-time buyers by the Government for every £200 they save in a new Help to Buy Isa . £35bn Cut in Government interest payments on the national debt thanks to low inflation rate . £5.2bn Projected size of budget surplus in 2018/19 . 71.6% Debt as a share of GDP in 2019/20, down from 80.3% last year . £13bn Expected proceeds from the sale of Government assets in Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley . The Government already has a number of initiatives aimed at those trying to buy their first property. The original Help to Buy scheme, which has proved extremely popular, allows people to buy a home worth up to £600,000 with just a 5 per cent deposit. The Government provides them with a loan – which is initially interest-free – to make up the rest of the down payment. Around 45,000 buyers have benefited from the scheme so far. The new Isa is the latest attempt by the Government to help first-time buyers. The accounts will work like a traditional Isa, with interest paid out by banks and building societies tax-free. They will be available to new account-holders for four years – but once opened there is no limit on how long someone can save for. Savers can make an initial deposit of £1,000 when they open the Isa, but after this can only pay in a maximum of £200 a month. A £50 bonus is then added by the Treasury. The minimum bonus size is £400, and the maximum is £3,000 – which would be payable on a balance of £12,000. The bonus is only paid out when someone buys their first home, and only applies to properties worth up to £450,000 in London and £250,000 elsewhere in the UK. Savers must be 16 or over to open a Help to Buy Isa. They are individual accounts, meaning a group of four friends buying a home together could benefit from a total of £12,000 in Government bonuses. Official figures suggest around £2billion could be paid out in bonuses between now and 2020. Britain’s biggest bank, Lloyds Banking Group, estimated the bonus payouts could slash the average time it takes a first-time buyer to save a 5 per cent deposit from 37 months to 27. Stephen Noakes, the bank’s managing director of retail products, said: ‘We believe this provides a genuine solution to the challenge of raising a deposit. We know that this is the key barrier when trying to buy a first home. ‘This rewards positive savings behaviour and makes a real difference in helping young people get on to the property ladder faster.’ 'Thrilled': David and Laura Picken want to buy their first home and start a family so the Government's new Help To Buy Isa will help them get on the property ladder . Young couple Laura and David Picken are renting a home while they save for a deposit, and were ‘thrilled’ to hear of the Government’s Help To Buy Isa. The new measure, designed to help first-time buyers, will see the Government contribute £50 for every £200 saved. The pair are currently paying £570 a month in rent on a three-bedroom terraced house in Liverpool, but would like to buy a home of their own with a garden so they can start a family. Mrs Picken, 27, takes home £28,000 a year as a violinist while her husband, 26, works in hospitality earning £11,000. They have so far managed to save £2,000 towards a house deposit in Isas with the Royal Bank of Scotland at an interest rate of 0.5 per cent. As Mrs Picken is self-employed, her income varies from month to month and she finds it difficult to put money aside regularly. She hopes the Help to Buy Isa will speed up the couple’s saving. The maximum Government bonus is £3,000 per person, so they could get £6,000 between them from the State. Mrs Picken said: ‘This Help To Buy Isa is going to make a huge difference to us because we’ll be able to save up and get on the property ladder faster. ‘The significance of something like this is monumental for us because it could halve the time it takes us to put enough aside for a deposit. This will speed up our lives, it’s absolutely brilliant and I’m thrilled.’","New first-time buyers' Isa will help thousands  get on to the property ladder .

"Staff at a piggery have been left shocked after arriving for work one morning only to be confronted by an 'ocean' of about 500 dead pigs. It is believed that the pigs at the Pig Improvement Company (PIC) in Grong Grong, NSW, died of extreme heat exhaustion, after an air-conditioning system in the holding shed failed on February 23. According to an anonymous whistleblower's tip-off to The Daily Advertiser, a security company was alerted when the system faltered but they failed to contact on-call employees to notify them in time and all 500 pigs in the piggery baked to death. Over 500 pigs have died in a piggery in NSW due to heat exhaustion after an air-conditioner broke . Pig Improvement Company CEO Paul O'Leary claims the company, who employ 25 staff, are thousands of dollars out of pocket and all the staff are traumatised by the incident. He said that further investigation into the disaster appeared to show that the shed did not have an adequate ventilation system. 'We have 24-hour monitored alarm systems,' Mr O' Leary said. 'In this instance the alert was unable to avert a disaster – a situation every business dreads. 'The consequence was distressed staff arriving onsite the following morning to discover the stock losses.' Mr O'Leary told the newspaper that such a loss has been emotional for the staff, who invest a lot of their time into caring for the pigs. In May last year, Grong Grong piggery came under scrutiny when video footage appeared online apparently showing piglets in pieces and pregnant sows confined to tiny stalls. At the time, Australian Pork Limited told the newspaper that the video footage of the piglets scattered across the ground was clearly staged. Pig Improvement Company CEO Paul O'Leary claims the company, who employ 25 staff, are thousands of dollars out of pocket and all the staff are traumatised by the incident . 'These people have broken and entered in these properties in the dead of night and disturbed and distressed the animals,' Ms Mackintosh said. 'They portray this as the way the pig industry does business and that's not the case. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, animal protection group Voiceless expressed his concern over the fact that the pig deaths had been covered up. 'That these animals reportedly died in such a horrifying way, and the public and relevant authorities have apparently been kept in the dark for weeks, raises serious concerns around the transparency and accountability of this industry,' a spokesperson said. 'This represents a disgusting and unacceptable failure to ensure animal welfare, and one which would have caused those 500 sentient beings unimaginable suffering.' The whistleblower is apparently a member of staff and was reportedly told by management that they would lose their job if they told anyone. However CEO Mr O'Leary has denied this.","500 dead pigs have been found in a NSW piggery .

"A woman who spent 22 years on death row in her son's killing tearfully described on Tuesday how she suffered twin tragedies in losing her young child and being the victim of a 'blatant miscarriage of justice.' Debra Milke spoke out at a news conference in Phoenix, Arizona a day after her case was dismissed in the 1989 killing of her 4-year-old son, who thought he was going to see Santa Claus when he was taken to the desert and shot in the back of the head. Her conviction was overturned by an appeals court that ruled her murder conviction was tainted because of the work of a discredited detective. Scroll down for video . In tears: Debra Milke cries during a news conference in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 24, 2015 as she speaks of the tragedy of losing her child and of being falsely accused of his murder . Debra Milke (pictured in a prison mug shot) denied that she ever confessed to killing her son Christopher (right) who was wearing his favorite outfit when he was murdered by two of her friends . Milke sobbed repeatedly as she read a statement about her ordeal, fondly recalling her son's love of bubble gum and riding his big wheel. 'Losing a child to murder is a devastating tragedy with an indescribable pain no parent should ever have to feel. It is the purest form of anguish imaginable that sears the soul, and the hurt never goes away, ever,' she said. 'The only thing worse is to be falsely accused of participating in your own child's death.' Milke was convicted of murder and sentenced to death based almost entirely on an unrecorded confession authorities say she made to Detective Armando Saldate. Her lawyers  called him a 'dirty cop' with a long history of misconduct. 'She's an innocent woman who never should have been convicted. She was the victim of a dirty cop,' defense lawyer Michael Kimerer said. Debra Milke said in a news conference on Tuesday that losing a child to murder is the 'purest form of anguish imaginable that sears the soul, and the hurt never goes away, ever' Debra Milke looks on in tears during a news conference as she speaks of her painful time on death row for the alleged killing of her 4-year old son and who  was freed this week after her murder case was dismissed . Milke was convicted of plotting with two friends to kill her son Christopher, who was led into the desert and shot three times in the back of the head . Prosecutors insist that Milke had her son killed, but they lost their final appeal last week to have her retried in her son's death. Authorities say Milke's motive was that she didn't want the child anymore and didn't want him to live with his father. James Styers and Roger Scott, the two men who led Christopher to his death, have refused to testify against Milke. While Milke sat on death row, the Arizona Supreme Court had gone so far as to issue a death warrant for her in 1997. The execution was delayed because she had yet to exhaust federal appeals. Multiple rulings in other cases said the now-retired officer either lied under oath or violated suspects' rights during interrogations, according to the federal appeals court. Milke sued the city of Phoenix, Maricopa County and numerous individuals earlier this month, alleging authorities violated her civil rights. She also contends she was denied a fair trial and was a victim of malicious prosecution. James Styers and Roger Scott are on death row for the horrific murder of Christopher. They have both denied that Milke had anything to do with the killing . Milke, whose mother was a German who married a U.S. Air Force military policeman in Berlin in the 1960s, has drawn strong support from citizens of that nation and Switzerland, neither of which has the death penalty. All charges against Debra Jean Milke were dismissed on  Monday -  25 years after she was convicted and sentenced to die for the brutal murder of her four-year-old son. Milke was released from jail in 2013 after 22 years on Arizona's death row, but still faced the possibility of a retrial and remained free on bail with an electronic monitoring bracelet. Dirty cop: Detective Armando Saldate claimed that Milke confessed to him - but never recorded the confession. His testimony sent her to death row. It was later discredited . On Monday, Maricopa County Superior Court before Judge Rosa Mroz found that there was not enough evidence to take the case against Milke to trial. She ordered the charges dismissed with prejudice - meaning she cannot be re-tried. The judge also ordered probation officers to remove her electronic monitoring bracelet and close out Milke's case. The hearing took just two minutes, according to KSAZ-TV. Milke, 51, hugged her lawyer and her supporters and sobbed as she left the courtroom on Monday. Milke's conviction was based almost entirely on Phoenix police Detective Armando Saldate's claims that she had confessed to him that she plotted to killed her son Christopher. Debra Milke, pictured on Monday in court, had murder charges against her dismissed - 25 years after she was convicted and sentenced to die . Milke leaned in for a hug with her attorney Lori Voepel (right) on Monday after she was finally cleared of all charges in the murder of her son . The confession was never recorded and it was later revealed that Saldate had a history of lying under oath and violating the rights of suspects. In December 1989, Milke dressed her son in his favorite outfit and sent him off to the mall to see Santa Claus in the care of her roommate, James Styers. Styers later picked up Roger Scott and the two men drove Christopher into the desert and shot him three times in the back of the head. Prosecutors argued that Milke no longer wanted Christopher, but hated his father so much that she didn't want to give up custody of the boy. At the time of his arrest, Scott claimed that Milke had discussed splitting the boy's $50,000 life insurance policy with him - but later recanted that statement. Styers and Scott were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder. The refused to testify against Milke and now maintain she had nothing to do with the little boy's death. Both men are awaiting execution. In 2013, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned her conviction and sentence of death, finding that the . Judge Mroz, when she ordered Milke's release, said allegations of Saldate's past misconduct 'cast serious doubts on the validity of the Defendant’s alleged confession.' Saldate, who has since retired from the police force, said previously that he would not testify at a retrial of Milke. Prosecutors had tried to force Saldate to testify at the re-trial and set a new trial date for her, but the Arizona Supreme Court rejected the request. Milke has filed a lawsuit against Phoenix, Maricopa County and several officials and investigators involved in her conviction. She says she was the victim of malicious prosecution.","Debra Milke spoke out at a news conference in Phoenix, Arizona a day after her case was dismissed in the 1989 killing of her 4-year-old son .

"A Washington police dog has died after he ingested powdered crystal meth during a massive bust that led to 44 pounds of narcotics being seized by authorities. Barney was serving a search warrant with his handler, Tacoma police officer Henry Betts, when he accidentally inhaled the methamphetamine and became sick. The 11-year-old Labrador mix had a body temperature of 109 and was having seizures when he was brought to BluePearl Veterinary Hospital on Tuesday night. Barney, 11, is dead after he ingested powdered crystal meth during a drug bust in Tacoma, Washington . Barney was serving a search warrant when he accidentally inhaled the methamphetamine and became sick . Barney was becoming more alert and responsive by Wednesday morning and doctors and doctors were 'cautiously optimistic' that he would make a full recovery. He died on Thursday. Officer Betts and Barney had been partnered up since 2010. Betts said: 'He's a phenomenal dog. 'Really just incredible.' Narcotics dogs usually signal when drugs are present by placing their noses on the substance. Barney put his sniffer on the unwrapped drugs and came in direct contact with the meth, Q13 Fox reported. Dr. Kobi Johnson said: ''Methamphetamines are extremely toxic to dogs.' As a result of the canine's courageous actions, three men were arrested. Samuel Tafolla Hernandez, 39, Thomas Servantes Diaz, 34, and Jose Mauricio Lozano-Miranda, 38, were all charged Wednesday with unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said: 'This is one of the biggest drug busts we've seen in Pierce County in the last decade.' In addition to the meth, officers found $225,000 concealed in a book case during the bust. The men are scheduled to make their initial court appearance Thursday afternoon.","Labrador mix Barney ingested meth during bust in Tacoma, Washington .

New Yorker: A pregnant De Matteo is pictured with her then-partner Shooter Jennings and their daughter Alabama Gypsyrose in the East Village - the neighborhood where she had an apartment - in 2011 . Musician Donald Cumming, pictured on stage and right, was seen outside his destroyed apartment in tears . Indie rock star Donald Cumming, who also had an apartment in one of the collapsed buildings, was seen in tears trying to get through a police cordon to the scene of the blast. The 33-year-old singer, from the band The Virgins, was chaperoned by an NYPD officer as he tried to get back home. He declined to speak but confirmed he had been a resident of the building. Fellow musicians from the band Public Access T.V. had lived in a first-floor apartment in 123 Second Avenue - one of the buildings that collapsed - since 2010 but assured their fans they were safe. They are currently on tour on the West Coast. 'We've got a lot of messages about our apartment burning down in New York today,' frontman John Eatherly wrote on their Facebook page. 'We are all safe. Very very lucky. Thoughts go out to everyone else affected by it and the firefighters.' Speaking to the New York Daily News, Eatherly added that as well as living at the apartment, the band used it to rehearse. They lost some gear and tapes but are just relieved they were not inside. Safe: Public Access TV, a New York-based band who lived in a first-floor apartment of one of the buildings, are currently touring the West Coast. They said they feel 'very very lucky' Everything lost: Married couple Nora Brooks, a graduate student, and Matt Brooks, a puppet builder for Henson, lost everything in the blast but were not home at the time. They lost their cat in the fire . Survivors: Friends are now raising money for the couple, pictured, on a gofundme page (link below) 'I was shaking watching it,' he said. 'Just hoping that no one got hurt. It felt like one of those things that you never think is going to happen to you.' Among others who lost their homes and belongings are married couple Nora and Matt Brooks. The couple, who lived on the top floor of 123 Second Avenue, had been visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Mrs Brooks' parents when the building exploded, the Daily Beast reported. They got a call from their roommate - who managed to clamber from the apartment to safety - who broke the horrifying news. She said their cat had run away when she tried to grab it. Matt, a puppet builder for Henson who had lived at the apartment since 1991, lost cameras, other filming equipment and valuable puppets in the blast, according to friends who set up a gofundme page for the couple. His wife is a graduate student at The New School and lost all of her books.

Jessica Veronica of The Veronicas, who lives down the street from the blast, posted a couple of videos showing smoke billowing into the sky. 'An explosion just happened one block from our apartment in NYC. Terrifying,' she captioned one video, adding: 'Courageous Fire Fighters here in NYC. No hesitation.' Intense flames consumed the buildings on Second Avenue and 7th Street following the explosion at 3.15pm on Thursday - about an hour after Con Edison inspectors visited the building and found the gas-related work being done there 'unacceptable,' according to officials.

"Our pillar-box red, open-top Chevrolet would fail its MoT abysmally. The suspension has gone; only the driver's door opens from the inside and there doesn't even seem to be a speedometer. But it's still going and it's a lot of fun. A bit like Cuba, in fact. Everyone says you have to go now before the chicken nugget invasion changes everything following President Obama's decision to lift sanctions after 55 years. A place with a past and a future: Havana is an evocative city, rich in Spanish colonial architecture . For sure, change is needed in a country where almost everyone is denied access to the internet, where most people take home around $20 a month, where there is still rationing and where not believing in the 'Triumph of the revolution' still makes you an enemy of the state. But turning round this old tanker is going to take decades, not years. The real reason to go now is because for all their travails, the Cuban people are remarkably kind, honest and polite - and Havana is like nowhere else on Earth. Everywhere we go, there is a healthy scepticism about the Castro years and what might happen if outsiders are ever allowed to buy land and property. We're in the open-top Chevy (not driving it) on the way to Ernest Hemingway's house, 20 minutes from Havana. We've already downed a daiquiri at Floridita, where a statue of the great man occupies the end of the bar, and we've chased that up with a mojito at La Bodeguita del Medio, another of his hang-outs near the sublime Cathedral Square. Before the day is done, we'll sink more at La Terraza in the fishing village of Cojimar, the inspiration for The Old Man And The Sea, which helped Hemingway win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. At the wheel: Despite various mechanical troubles, Mark managed to take to the road in Cuba . He bought Finca Vigia in 1940 and lived there off and on for 20 years. It's pretty much how he left it. Bullfighting scenes and stuffed animals hang from the walls, his typewriter sits on the desk and rum competes for space with his books. Ask to see Ada and take along a translator. She has looked after the house for more than 20 years. When I ask her what Hemingway would make of Cuba today, her eyes fill with tears. 'I don't know,' she says, 'but Hemingway loved Cuba.' Back in Havana, our guide takes us to the Museum Of The Revolution, where Fidel, naturally, is the star of the show - but George W. Bush has a walk-on part in the rogue's gallery with the caption: 'Thank you cretin for helping us make socialism irrevocable.' Full of character: Trinidad is a touristy - but charming - colonial town  three hours south-east of Havana . What knocks us back is the beauty of the dilapidated grand houses, palaces and squares. It makes you wonder why on earth the British gave Cuba back to Spain in 1763 in return for Florida. Miami or Havana? No contest. A joke that still does the rounds is that the revolution failed on three fronts: breakfast, lunch and dinner. And it's no laughing matter. There's only so much dry fish with black beans on the side that a man in Havana can take. Our best dinner is at Mama Ines, where Fidel's ex-chef has opened his own restaurant. He's an engaging fellow and the walls are hung with black-and-white photos of him and his former boss. You absolutely have to eat at La Guarida, housed on the third floor of a glorious, crumbling building. The food is as dull as anywhere else, but the experience is exquisite: antique wine glasses, nicotine-stained walls, little balconies with room for one table each. There's music everywhere in Havana, of course. What takes us by surprise is the art. We have a tour of two studios where Fidel is caricatured as a false Jesus Christ and a sex maniac. Clutter and colour: Cuba's half-century on a limb has preserved Havana in a dilapidated but beautiful state . There aren't many decent hotels in the capital. We pick the pricey Saratoga opposite the vast Capitolio building (a metre higher than Capitol Hill, of which it is a near-perfect replica) because it has a pool on the roof. On the way to Trinidad, a colonial town three to four hours away, we call in at the Bay of Pigs and watch a 20-minute propaganda film about the failed U.S. invasion, then spend a couple of hours in Cienfuegos, which, frankly, leaves us cold, despite the 30 degree temperatures. Trinidad is charming, but touristy. Two nights here (we stay at the excellent Iberostar Grand) are ample. It was once prosperous thanks to sugar mills. Today, its cobbled streets house restaurants and gift shops. Two courses and a bottle of drinkable wine can be had for £20 a head. One of Cuba's best beaches, Playa Ancon, is eight miles away. We hire bikes and pedal off into the sunset, then persuade a local to bring us back in his rusting banger, bikes in the boot. Hitting the right notes: You can find  - as Mark did - music and art in many corners of Cuba . On the way back to Havana we stop briefly in Santa Clara, where the remains of Che Guevara, the poster boy of the revolution, are housed in a grand memorial building. We don't linger. We've done our bit with respect to Cuba's past and return to Havana, where the future is on everyone's lips. Our last night is in a private apartment on the top floor of a building in the residential Vedado district. After dinner, there's just time to take a horse and cart back to the old town, now a World Heritage site. What is going to happen to Cuba? No one knows. Life, hopefully, will be better for long-suffering Cubans, but it might not be quite such a potent cocktail for the rest of us. The Ultimate Travel Company (020 3051 8098, www.theultimatetravelcompany.co.uk) offers seven-night breaks in Cuba from £3,425 per person on a bed-and-breakfast basis, including four days in Havana, three nights in Trinidad and a final night in Havana at the Penthouse Ydalgo.

"Tough sell? More than two thirds of Americans have said they are not interested in buying Apple's new smart watch . Apple's new . smartwatch may be a tough sell, with 69 percent of Americans . indicating they are not interested in buying the gadget, . according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.

It allows users to check email, listen to music and make . phone calls from their wrist. Apple will sell various versions, . from a $349 'sport' edition to a $17,000 18-karat gold . timepiece. Ipsos surveyed 1,245 Americans online between March 9 and . March 13. The data was weighted to reflect the U.S. population . and has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage . points.

"Behind bars: Peter Mills was sentenced to 21 months for stealing £20,000 by hiding £50 notes in chocolate bar wrappers . A greedy thief used empty KitKat wrappers to smuggle £20,000 out of his workplace. Peter Mills, 68, would eat the chocolate then fill the empty wrapper with wads of £50 notes that he stole from his employers Vaultex Ltd in Tonbridge, Kent. He was caught on CCTV after his employers at the cash handling depot became suspicious. They discovered 97 incidents over 50 days of Mills hiding the money then concealing the wrappers on his body. Suspicious staff searched him and found five £50 notes round a KitKat wrapper, famed for its slogan 'have a break, have a KitKat'. Kent Police was called and further cash was found in Mills's car. And when his locker was searched, police discovered a stash of empty KitKat wrappers inside. Mills from Chatham, Kent, initially denied stealing the money during interviews with police, claiming  the money must have got caught up in the sweet wrappers by accident. But he admitted four offences of theft at Maidstone Crown Court after bank statements revealed £30,000 in cash had been paid in over a four-month period from February to May 2014. Prosecuter Mary Jacobson said: 'He surreptitiously put a bundle of notes into the wrapper. 'He would go off for a break and hide the wrapper in his trouser pocket before leaving the room. Greedy: Peter Mills would eat the Kit Kat then use the wrapper to steal wads of money from his employer, as shown in this mock up supplied by Kent police . 'He would secrete it to remove it from the building at the end of the shift and this was a very consistent pattern that he continued.' Mills, who started working for Vaultex Ltd in 2008, was given a 21 month prison sentence. Judge Jeremy Carey said it was 'very serious offending'. 'You were tempted and you succumbed and that puts a very different complexion on this case,' he said. 'There is a very unattractive feature because you have done everything you can to reduce your culpability. 'It is said you did so because you were ashamed of what you had done.'","Caught on CCTV after colleagues became suspicious of his behaviour .

The court heard that at the time of the accident the driver responsible, Jason Rea was a crystal meth junkie who was driving with five-times the supposed lethal dose of ice in his system after a five day bender . It appears that Mr Rea, in his drug-addled state, became alarmed by the flashing lights of road works. While in Gosford Coroner’s Court on Wednesday, it was suggested that Mr Rea may have feared police. He conducted three U-turns to drive on the wrong side of the road and steer dangerously into oncoming traffic. Evidence stated that Mr Rea intimidated other drivers by aiming for vehicles as drivers tried to swerve out of his way. Many panicked witnesses called Triple 0, describing how the ‘erratic’ driver was driving in the wrong direction and had almost taken out two workers at the construction site. ‘There’s a fri***ng lunatic on the road, he’s just came straight at me,’ one witness told emergency services, in a call that was used as evidence in court. ‘This guy is just on a death mission,’ another astonished caller said. Mr Rea’s Ford Falcon smashed head first into a Holden Captiva, which held a family of four, at 8.30pm as he drove southbound on the northbound road, 200 metres from the Hawkesbury Bridge .

Christine O’Donnell was driving her sons and daughter-in-law home to Kincumber from a dinner when her car was smashed into at great speed. She suffered horrific injuries and has already undergone 13 operations since she was injured. The victim is also still struggling with the mental trauma after the crash. Ms O’Donnell will soon undergo a serious operation that will cause her excruciating pain every time she tries to place her foot on the floor for a period of three months. Christine O’Donnell was driving her sons and daughter-in-law home to Kincumber from a dinner when her car was smashed into at great speed . After the accident, Mr Rea crawled out of the passenger window and crawled to safety. His leg was shattered so he was unable to walk. After he was freed, he was apprehended by a number of construction workers and ‘struggled violently’. Four police officers and a Rural Fire Service member were required to detain Mr Rea as he continued to lash out. Paramedics inserted a catheter in Mr Rea’s arm to sedate him, at which point his heart stopped beating. Although they tried to save his life, he died in the ambulance on route to Gosford Hospital. The counsel argued that the intensively high amount of ice Mr Rea had in his system was the cause of his death, opposed to mishandling during his arrest. The inquest continues on Thursday.

"A tube of Pringles similar to the tin a Mumsnet user found in her son's bedroom filled with urine . Messy teenage boys' bedrooms... they're the stuff nightmares are made of. But a mother on the parenting website Mumsnet has now clarified just how gruesome it can get when clearly out the room of an adolescent, after discovering a Pringles tube full of urine. The mum, who goes by the username 'myotherusernameisbetter' revealed she made the discovering while cleaning out her son's room this weekend. She wrote: 'Today [my second son] (13) was away for the day and I was waiting on hospital visiting time as my Mum is very unwell, I needed something to keep me occupied so I decided to do [his] room as a treat. 'Apart from the dirty laundry I found: 2 empty juice bottles, 1 empty smoothie carton, 1 empty milk shake carton, 6 empty crisp packets, 3 apple cores, a pile of orange peel, a pile of sweet wrappers, some bits of popcorn, 2 plastic bowls, 2 plastic cups......and a Pringle tube full of urine. 'We are going to have to have a talk when he gets home. The lid was on - I reached out to pick it up expecting it to be light.....it was heavy, and full of liquid - i opened and sniffed. 'It's just as well he keeps his windows open and heating off.' The revelation caused some shock to other users on the forum, with some saying that they would be serious consequences for such behaviour in their households. But other mothers, often of teenage boys, were sympathetic, with many sharing their own horror stories of items left to rot in their children's bedrooms. One user called SoupDragonwrite: 'I did [my son's room] whilst he was away over half term. 'I filled 4 kerbside recycling crates with paper, 2 with bottles and cans, 3/4 of the landfill bin and did approximately 47 billion loads of laundry which mostly consisted of odd socks. 'I was a little surprised not to find a dead rat.' Another called BellMcEnd said: 'I mucked out [my eight-year-old son's] bed today. 'Under his pillow I found: 4 books, 52p, a medal from sports day, a weird piece of felt he'd been doing something with at school for art, a lego man and a lip salve. 'I only changed it ten days ago.'

'A box of tissues, a small bin, and a beaker of clean water for temporary cleaning/dunking while the bathroom is occupied by me. 'Apparently our penis beaker is strange and not the done thing.'

"Some academics say such cheating is on the increase because schools are under huge pressure to improve their national league table positions . The shocking lengths cheating teachers go to in order to boost their schools' exam grades has been exposed in a new report. Blatant cases include staff suggesting the correct answers to pupils during exams, scribbling them in pencil on completed coursework so that pupils can then write over them in pen, and whispering to candidates in spoken language tests. Some academics say such cheating is on the increase because schools are under huge pressure to improve their national league table positions. In one extreme case last year, unconnected to the new report, the entire governing body of a school was dissolved and eight members of staff were suspended over allegations of exam irregularities, although five have since been reinstated. The examples of cheating are contained in guidance to exam boards about how to deal with 'malpractice' in this summer's A-level and GCSE exams, published by umbrella body the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ). Examples included: . - A timetable clash that meant several candidates sat an A-level English Literature paper in the morning when it was officially scheduled for the afternoon, allowing a teacher to enter the exam hall, look at the paper and pass information to candidates taking the test later; . - A member of staff who was in the exam room during a GCSE Geography paper suggesting possible answers to pupils when they raised their hands; . - A number of candidates who admitted they had been given information about a confidential GCSE English question papers by the head of the exam centre; . - A teacher who had made additions in pencil to a number of supposedly completed 'high level, controlled' science assessments and returned the answers to the pupils so they could make corrections, which they did in different coloured pens; . - A teacher conducting a GCSE Italian speaking test who was heard on the official recording whispering words in Italian to the candidate and, presumably in an attempt to hide the cheating, pausing the recorder a number of times, in breach of the rules. Blatant cases include staff suggesting the correct answers to pupils during exams and scribbling them in pencil on completed coursework so that pupils can then write over them in pen . Neither the JCQ nor the exam boards were prepared to give further details about the examples yesterday, but the report did record the penalties meted out to the guilty teachers – usually a ban from involvement with exam papers, or access to exam rooms for between two and five years. The Government's exam watchdog Ofqual issued 119 penalties against school and college staff for malpractice in GCSE and A-levels last summer, up from 100 the previous year. Showing how widespread the problem is, schools recently investigated include St John's in Marlborough, Wiltshire, where a teacher was said to have briefed pupils during what should have been a silent coursework assessment, and Small Heath primary in Birmingham, where a now former head changed pupils' SATs papers to improve their results. At Goole High School in Hull, eight members of staff were suspended last September after allegations of exam irregularities. Five have returned to their jobs but two remain suspended pending an internal investigation. Professor Alan Smithers, director for education and employment research at Buckingham University, said: 'Getting good exam results is tremendously important for schools and if they don't they can be in serious trouble. But the exams are not robust enough to withstand clever cheating and worried teachers can be tempted. The evidence is that cheating by teachers is on the rise.' And Professor Rob Coe, an expert on exams at Durham University, warned that teachers were losing their 'professional morality', adding: 'It is kind of seen as OK to do things you know are wrong because everyone else is doing them.' JCQ director general Michael Turner said: 'Having a robust and secure examination system is essential. Awarding organisations take any allegation of malpractice very seriously.'","Cases include staff suggesting right answers to pupils during exams .

"Tennessee prosecutors have made sterilization of women part of plea negotiations so many times in the past five years that the district attorney has banned his staff from offering that as an option. Prosecutors in Nashville have used the invasive surgery as a bargaining chip at least four times in the past five years. Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk, a former defense attorney who took over the office in September, has ordered lawyers in his office not to seek sterilization by defendants. Scroll down for video . Nashville prosecutors have made sterilization of women part of plea negotiations at least four times in the past five years, leading Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk to ban his office from offering that option . Funk said he hadn't heard of it happening before but didn't ask, according to the Tennessean. He said: 'I have let my office know that that is not an appropriate condition of a plea. 'It is now policy that sterilization will never be a condition of deal-making in the district attorney's office. 'The bottom line is the government can't be ordering a forced sterilization.' Funk said people could be ordered to stay away from children and the state wouldn't have to resort to such invasive measures. In the most recent case, a woman with a 20-year history of mental illness had been charged with neglect after her five-day-old baby mysteriously died. Her defense attorney said the prosecutor assigned to the case wouldn't go forward with a plea deal to keep the woman out of prison unless she had the surgery. Defense attorneys say there have been at least three similar cases in the past five years. That figure suggests the practice may not be as rare as people think and may happen more often outside the public view and without the blessing of a court. However, such deals do happen. 224,000 adults experienced serious mental illness in 2012-13. 47,000 children ages 12 to 17 had one major depressive episode in 2012-13. 103,892 adults in Davidson County with mental illness from 2010-12. Nearly 20 per cent of the about 1,700 jail inmates have a mental health issue, according to the Davidson County's Sheriff's Office. Source: The Tennessean . In West Virginia, a 21-year-old unmarried mother of three agreed to have her tubes tied in 2009 as part of her probation after she pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute marijuana. And last year, a Virginia man who fathered children with several women agreed to undergo a vasectomy in exchange for less prison time in a child endangerment case. Forced sterilization came up in a different way in California last year, when Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that banned state prisons from forcing female inmates to be sterilized. The law was pushed through after the Center for Investigative Reporting found that nearly 150 female prisoners had been sterilized between 2006 and 2010. An audit found that the state failed to make sure the inmate's consent was lawfully obtained in every case. The most recent Nashville case involved Jasmine Randers, 36, who had been under court supervision for mental illness when she left her home state of Minnesota. She gave birth in West Memphis, Arkansas, then fled a homeless shelter to come to Nashville, said her attorney, assistant public defender Mary-Kathryn Harcombe. Court records show Randers reported awakening in a motel, where she'd slept in a bed with the baby, only to find the child unresponsive. She reportedly called a taxi two hours later and took the child to a local hospital, where the infant was pronounced dead. There was no sign of injury, and the cause of death was undetermined. Police later learned that in 2004, Randers stabbed herself in the stomach while pregnant, though the fetus was not harmed. She told investigators that it happened when she fell down the stairs while cutting fruit. The assistant district attorney who worked the case, Brian Holmgren, was once a senior attorney with the National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse and serves on the international advisory board of the National Center for Shaken Baby Syndrome. He has been both praised and fiercely criticized for his aggressive courtroom tactics on behalf of children. When Holmgren insisted Randers undergo sterilization to avoid prison, Harcombe complained. The district attorney took over the case, and Randers was not sterilized. The prosecutor agreed Randers was mentally ill and she was institutionalized after being found not guilty by reason of insanity. Harcombe said: 'Any time a woman is given a choice between prison and this surgery, that is inherently coercive, even in cases where there is no mental illness.' Jasmine Randers, who has a history of mental illness, was charged with neglect after her five-day-old baby died. Her defense attorney said the prosecutor wouldn't go forward with a plea deal unless she was sterilized . Harcombe said Holmgren previously asked that another client agree to be sterilized in order to get a plea deal. She refused and it didn't become part of the plea deal reached in that case. Nashville defense attorney Carrie Searcy said Holmgren asked that two of her clients who gave birth to children who tested positive for drugs undergo sterilization. Neither did, Searcy said, because both women had already undergone the procedure. Assistant public defender Joan Lawson said she also had been involved in cases in which a prosecutor had put sterilization on the table. She said she refused the idea and resolved her cases without sterilization. The attorney said: 'It's always been more of 'If your client is willing to do this, then I might be inclined to talk about probation.' Lawson said it was typically not an explicit demand, was not an everyday occurrence and was made off the record. Sterilization coerced by the legal system evokes a dark time in America, when minorities, the poor and those deemed mentally unfit or 'deficient' were forced to undergo medical procedures that prevented them from having children. Paul Lombardo, a law professor and historian who teaches at Georgia State University, said: 'The history of sterilization in this country is that it is applied to the most despised people - criminals and the people we're most afraid of, the mentally ill - and the one thing that that these two groups usually share is that they are the most poor. 'That is what we've done in the past, and that's a good reason not to do it now.'","Nashville prosecutors have offered option four times in the past five years .

"Actress Caitlin Gerard, who plays teenage meth addict Aubry Taylor in the controversial new ABC series American Crime, won the role after producers were blown away by the chemistry between her and her on-screen lover Elvis Nolasco, who plays Carter Nix. But the real sparks  flew when the pretty 26-year-old arrived on set last summer in Austin, Texas to shoot the show's pilot, and was introduced her to 54-year-old co-star Timothy Hutton. Now sources tell Daily Mail Online that the two are secretly living together. 'Even though Caitlin wasn't born until 1988 – seven years after Tim won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Ordinary People – she fell head over heels in love with him,' says a source. Scroll down for video . May/December: Timothy Hutton, 54,  and Caitlin Gerard, 26, take a selfie with Courtney Ray after the 'American Crime' screening in Atlanta last month. Cutie: Caitlin Gerard appeared in Magic Mike and made her mark as a model doing print work for clothing companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Rag and Hollister . 'And after quietly dating for several months, he's asked her to move into his new Austin, Texas home with him and his oldest son. 'This is the first super serious relationship for Caitlin, who portrays a teen on the new series,' says the source. 'Tim, on the other hand, has been married and divorced twice.' His first marriage to actress Debra Winger lasted from 1986 to 1990, and produced their 27-year-old son Noah. His second walk down the aisle was with illustrator Aurore Discard d'Estaing - niece of former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing – and that eight-year union produced another son, Milo, 13. The source says that, as taken as Caitlin was with her 28-years-senior co-star, he was just as smitten with her. 'Tim, [who plays Russ, the ex-husband of a character played by Felicity Huffman] loved Caitlin's wacky sense of humor and was impressed with the fact she's fluent in both French and German,' says the source.

And she's made her mark as a model doing print work for clothing companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Rag and Hollister. 'Caitlin also studied at the French school, the Lycee International in Los Angeles, and attended UCLA, so she's got both beauty and brains.' And while the perky blonde actress has mostly dated non-Hollywood types, Hutton, who is part owner of the New York eatery P.J. Clarke's, and son of the late actor Jim Hutton, is known for having hooked up with a bevy of Hollywood beauties. Hutton's 27-year-old son Noah . 'Tim's dated some very high-profile types,' says the source. 'His romantic conquests include Ronald Reagan's daughter Patti Davis, actresses Diane Lane, Mary Louise Parker, Angelina Jolie, Roseanna Arquette, and Downton Abby star Elizabeth McGovern. 'It's rumored that Angelina was so heartbroken when he called it quits that she had an 'H' tattooed on her wrist because of her love for him.' American Crime is filmed in Austin, Texas. And there are already talks that the series, which won its time slot last week when it premiered, will be picked up for a second season; thus allowing the couple to stay put in the Austin home they now share. 'Tim's son Noah – who ironically is just a year older than Caitlin- stays with the couple when he's in Austin,' says the source. 'He's following in his famous parent's footsteps, working as a producer and director, and is currently involved with a 15-year-long project called Mapping of the Human Brain and everyone says he's brilliant. 'He and Caitlin really hit it off and why shouldn't they… they are basically the same age. 'Tim and Caitlin have been trying to keep their love under wraps,' adds the source, 'but they've been seen out and about in Austin and San Marcos, shopping and dining out at such places as Gil's Broiler in historic old San Marcos.'

Last night, after the resignation of its police chief, two officers were shot and wounded as protesters demonstrated outside the department's headquarters. And  in Austin, an investigation was launched at the University of Texas in Austin, claiming their chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon used the same racist chant that caused the fraternity's University of Oklahoma chapter, to be shut down earlier this week. 'The timing for a show like American Crime is perfect,' says the source. 'And it's nice to hear that amidst all the storylines about murder, drugs and racism that a couple of actors managed to find love on the set.'","Timothy Hutton met Caitlin Gerard last summer in Austin,Texas to when they were shooting pilot for new series .

"Talk show legend Larry King has revealed that he wants his body frozen when he dies so that he can be revived at some later date in the future to continue his TV career. The broadcaster, who is going to be 82 in November, said he doesn't believe in the afterlife and so is considering getting frozen so that he can one day make a surprise return. 'I think I'd like to be frozen and that would be the only hope that I could come back,' he said. 'My wife says, 'What if you come back 200 years from now? You won't know anybody?' I say, 'I'll make new friends.' [laughs] So I fear death.' The broadcaster, who is going to be 82 in November, has said he doesn't believe in the afterlife and is considering getting frozen so that he can one day make a surprise return to our screens . King, who spent 25 years hosting his CNN chat show Larry King Live until it ended in 2010, told The Hill that being frozen felt 'logical' to him. 'They take the body right away. They put it in a compression chamber, they inject you with a fluid that keeps certain things working even while you're dead, it keeps blood flowing and the like. They get you into a chamber. And they don't chop your head off, that's not true, that's just a rumor,' he explained. King, who had clearly done his homework, explained that the procedure costs $130,00 and his body would be placed in a tube in either Arizona or New Hampshire. 'If you died of lung cancer, and they cure it, and they can unfreeze you, and take away your lung cancer, why not? It's better than embalming and then being put in the ground. Or being burned. Come on.' Once King is revived he plans to continue with his career as an interviewer. 'They'll be shows from the moon. My God, would we travel electronically? Don't you wonder about those things? What is the future going to be like?,' he asked. The broadcaster, pictured with Snoop Dogg, currently hosts Larry King Now on Hulu and RT America during the week, and on Thursdays he hosts Politicking with Larry King . 'Yes, I'd want to interview people. I'd want to interview the guy from Mars. And go to other planets and ask questions.' King began his broadcast career in the 1950s as a local journalist and radio interviewer in Florida. He rose through the ranks to become a prominent all-night national radio broadcaster starting in 1978, and then, in 1985, began hosting the nightly interview TV program Larry King Live on CNN. He currently hosts Larry King Now on Hulu and RT America during the week, and on Thursdays he hosts Politicking with Larry King, a weekly political talk show which airs in the evening on the same two channels. Over his expansive career he has earned an Emmy, two Peabody Awards and ten Cable ACE Awards among other accolades.","The broadcaster, who is going to be 82 in November, said he is considering getting frozen so that he can one day make a surprise return to our screens .

"If you're the sort of gentleman who holds the door open for a lady – or the sort of woman who expects him to – then be warned. Such acts of chivalry may actually be 'benevolent sexism' in disguise, according to researchers. Experts say this type of sexism is harder to spot than the 'hostile sexism' we are more familiar with – because it often masquerades as gallantry. It is typified by paternal and protective behaviour, from encouraging smiles to holding doors open. Sexist? Boston researchers carried out a study into types of sexism in men. They say there are two types of sexists, identifiable by their smile (stock image shown) 'Hostile sexist men' were less approachable and less friendly while those who displayed 'benevolent sexism' were nicer and smiled more . US researchers argue that while women may enjoy being showered with attention, benevolent sexism is 'insidious' and men who are guilty of it see women as incompetent beings who require their 'cherished protection'. Professor Judith Hall, of Northeastern University in Boston, said: 'Benevolent sexism is like a wolf in sheep's clothing that perpetuates support for gender inequality among women. 'These supposed gestures of good faith may entice women to accept the status quo in society because sexism literally looks welcoming, appealing and harmless.' Working with a male colleague, Professor Hall paired 27 men with women they had never met before and gave them a quiz game to play and time to chat afterwards. Ladies should behave like men if they want to work in male-dominated industries, according to a controversial study. Research by Professor Ann Marie Ryan, a psychologist at Michigan State University, suggests recruiters prefer more masculine traits to those commonly associated with women. She asked women to apply for leadership roles in male-dominated industries such as engineering in front of a panel of volunteers asked to evaluate the candidates' suitability. Some of the women were asked to emphasise 'masculine-like' traits such as assertiveness, independence and raw ambition. Others were asked to display more 'feminine traits' - warmth, supportiveness and a nurturing nature. The panel, irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it, decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process. The men, who were aged 18 to 22, also filled in a survey designed to detect sexist attitudes. Examples of hostile sexism included agreeing that women tend to exaggerate problems at work, while someone who is benevolently sexist will believe women should be rescued before men from a sinking ship. They found men whose answers led to them being classed as benevolently sexist smiled more while playing the quiz game and chatting. They were more patient while waiting for their female partners to answer the trivia questions and warmer, friendlier and chattier than those who were hostile sexists. Writing in the journal Sex Roles, the researchers said that while such behaviour may be well-intentioned, this doesn't mean it isn't harmful. Men who are guilty of benevolent sexism see women as 'warm and pure, yet helpless and incompetent beings'. Study co-author Jin Goh said: 'Benevolent sexist men hold women in high regard and are willing to sacrifice themselves to save and protect women. However, benevolent sexist men perceive women as the weaker gender at the same time. Thousands marched on 8 March 2015 for International Women's day. More than 1,000 women and men were marching for gender equality in New York City today - pictured here - as millions of people across the world rallied to demand change . 'Unless sexism is understood as having both hostile and benevolent properties, the insidious nature of benevolent sexism will continue to be one of the driving forces behind gender inequality in our society.' But critics have argued that there is nothing wrong with men trying to protect women as they are usually the physically stronger sex. Jill Kirby, a writer on social policy, said: 'There are times when it is very important for women to be protected. We should accept this and not seek to stamp out what is likely a good instinct on the whole.'","Boston researchers carried out a study into types of sexism in men .

"Dozens of Labour candidates were last night under pressure to hand back ‘blood money’ donated by Tony Blair. The former prime minister yesterday confirmed he has donated £1,000 to each of the 106 Labour candidates fighting the party’s target seats. Labour has welcomed the donation, despite unease among some in the party about Mr Blair’s money-spinning links to foreign corporations and dictatorships. Dozens of Labour candidates are under pressure to hand back ‘blood money’ donated by former Prime Minister Tony Blair. He confirmed he has donated £1,000 to each of the 106 candidates . Former Labour adviser Dan Hodges said the money involved was not enough to be worth the potential controversy. ‘Who exactly is meant to benefit from this?’ he said. ‘One hundred and six cash-strapped candidates, I suppose. But even though every little helps, £1000 isn’t going to go all that far. 'And each of those candidates is about to spend every hour between now and polling day being chased around by angry people in ill-fitting multi-coloured jumpers who will shout: “Did you take Blair’s blood money?”’ Tory sources last night confirmed they expect some candidates to make an issue of the Blair donation on local leaflets. The defence minister Anna Soubry yesterday sent a message to her Labour opponent in the marginal seat of Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, saying simply: ‘Blair money, yes or no?’ Defence minister Anna Soubry (pictured left) questioned her Labour opponent in the marginal seat of Broxtowe about the money; SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said it was ‘extraordinary’ that five Labour candidates in Scotland were taking 'bad money' from Mr Blair . Her opponent, the former Labour MP Nick Palmer, a recipient of the cash, did not give an answer. SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said it was ‘extraordinary’ that five Labour candidates in Scotland were taking ‘bad money’ from Mr Blair. He added: ‘The fact that Labour candidates are happy to accept donations from the man who led us into the illegal war in Iraq, introduced tuition fees and started the process of NHS privatisation is extraordinary. ‘Tony Blair’s bad money will do Labour in Scotland no good.’ Rhodri Glyn Thomas, the Plaid Cymru member of the Welsh Assembly for Carmarthen East, challenged Welsh candidates to hand the money back. He added: ‘The former Prime Minister since leaving office has amassed a multi-million pound fortune by doing the bidding of the global banks that created the longest lasting recession since records began with their rotten behaviour. 'He has worked for multinational energy companies who have rigged the energy market created by his Labour Government resulting in inflated energy costs for consumers, and global dictators guilty of human rights abuses. Mr Blair, who has a strained relationship with Ed Miliband, said he was giving the money directly to Labour candidates in marginal seats because ‘this is where the election will be won for Labour' 'It is deeply disturbing that this blood money will now be used by the Labour Party in Carmarthenshire.’ Mr Blair, who has a strained relationship with Ed Miliband, said he was giving the money directly to Labour candidates in marginal seats because ‘this is where the election will be won for Labour.’ The donation represents a relatively modest gesture from Mr Blair, whose personal fortune is estimated at anything up to £100 million following years of lucrative consultancies with big corporations and foreign regimes and a string of high-profile property deals. His intervention will be seen as a sign that the former prime minister is now keen to mend fences with a party leadership that has publicly distanced itself from his own creation, New Labour. Although he has said he has no desire to return to front line politics in the UK, friends say he is distressed by the way the party he led to three election victories has turned its back on him. Mr Blair is known to have backed Mr Miliband’s elder brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010. And he has made little secret of his dismay at the way Mr Miliband has dragged Labour to the left and alienated business.","Candidates under pressure to hand back 'blood money' donated by Blair .

"Her salacious blog about her time as a high-class call-girl formed the basis of the money-spinning Belle de Jour books, and was sensationally challenged in a legal case brought by her ex-boyfriend who said she had never worked as an escort. But now author Brooke Magnanti has released a photograph of herself dressed in racy lingerie and posing seductively, saying it will form the basis of an extraordinary court case in which she will aim to prove she worked as a prostitute. Former lover Owen Morris – known only as The Boy in the books – is suing Dr Magnanti for defamation and breach of privacy, claiming her books destroyed his RAF career and saying he does not believe she worked as a call girl. Scroll down for video . The picture and advert Brooke Magnanti says will prove she worked as a call girl after her former lover said claims she was a prostitute were false . But this week it emerged that Dr Magnanti, 39, is to counter-sue for libel, and is likely to use the photo from the archived page of an escort website Alphababes from October 2003 as evidence of her work as a prostitute. The advert gives her name as Taro – a reference to a restaurant mentioned in her book – and states: 'Check out the pictures of our new addition, a super intelligent petite blonde Taro who is currently studying for her PhD and can provide all the services.' Dr Magnanti – whose books spawned the TV drama Secret Diary Of A Call Girl starring Billie Piper – also has photos of what she claims are bank statements showing payments made by alleged clients of £240 and £260 in October 2003. In 2013, The Mail on Sunday revealed Mr Morris was suing the author, claiming she could not have been a prostitute while they were in a relationship because she was typically clad in 'cute second-hand jumpers' rather than sexy outfits. Dr Magnanti, 39, is to counter-sue for libel, and is likely to use the photo from the archived page of an escort website Alphababes from October 2003 as evidence of her work as a prostitute which gives her name as Taro . Her salacious blog about her time as a high-class call-girl formed the basis of the money-spinning Belle de Jour books . The books about Dr Magnanti's life were later turned into an ITV2 series Secret Diary of a Call Girl starring Billie Piper (right) But Dr Magnanti has hit back with photographs of her wearing a silk red top and a photo of her at Henley Regatta wearing an Austin Reed jacket and a bracelet bought for her by a client. She claims to have an appointment book detailing her clients, as well as Mr Morris's diary in which he allegedly writes about his shock of finding out about her work in the sex trade. On her Belle de Jour blog she has outlined her case, saying Mr Morris's claims were an attack on her integrity. 'When the case goes to trial, I will have to present evidence that I was a sex worker. Starting with this – an archive.org snap of my first escorting ad from October 2003. Readers of the first book may recall this was the session with the grumpy photographer I wrote about. As I have often said, it was that experience – being made to wear terrible lingerie, awkward poses, all the rest – that first made me think, 'Hey, I should be blogging this.' ' In Secret Diary Of A Call Girl, Billie Piper plays Belle, an upmarket London call girl who keeps her profession secret from her family . The couple met in Sheffield in 2001, while Dr Magnanti was studying for her PhD in forensic science. She began writing anonymously as Belle de Jour in 2003 and, in November 2009, outed herself in a newspaper interview. The couple had split earlier that year. In August 2013, The Mail on Sunday revealed Mr Morris would be suing Dr Magnanti. He said: 'The Belle de Jour myth has ruined me and rendered me unemployable. The private lives of me, my family and friends were not only used without my knowledge or consent, but twisted and darkened. I am suing her because I want to stop Brooke destroying my life further.' In a statement, Dr Magnanti said: 'I can confirm a counter-claim has been lodged. 'I have been advised by my QC to offer no further comment pending the resolution of this litigation.' If the case goes ahead, it is believed it will be the first time a woman has sued for defamation for suggestions she was not a prostitute. Last night, Mr Morris did not respond to requests for comment. The case against Dr Magnanti is set to be heard in June. Dr Magnanti's story was sensationally challenged in a legal case brought by her ex-boyfriend who said she had never worked as an escort but another lover has backed her claim . Rowing coach Nick Wilde, 45, is known in the books as main character ‘N’, one of Belle’s best friends and former partners. He confirmed Dr Magnanti told him she was a prostitute – but said details of her books were exaggerated or deliberately altered to protect individuals she knew. ‘I have read the books and I’m familiar with N, who is based on me,’ he said. ‘I know N is an amalgam of characters and that there are things the character said that I never said and events he attended that I was at. 'There are also things I said and places where I was that are attributed to other people.’ He said that Brooke did confess to him that she was a prostitute and he is astonished at the suggestion that she was not. ‘She told me she was a prostitute and I believe that,’ Nick says. ‘Of course, I have no proof one way or another, because obviously I wasn’t there when she did it and I never lived with her. 'But she didn’t throw money around, not that I could see – she wasn’t exactly turning up at the pub in a Bentley.’ Nick, who has had no contact with Brooke for six years, said he believes the books are fiction with  a basis in reality. ‘Characters in the book are based on people. There is truth in it, but where the line is of who is real, who is not, I can’t tell you. Time, place and context are all mixed up. ‘N is said to have had a threesome, but I always say if I was supposed  to have had half as much fun as N, it would be great.’","Brooke Magnanti's blog about her time as a high-class call-girl was the basis for Belle de Jour books .

"Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools and children’s services, said saving youngsters from exploitation required ‘political and moral courage' Politicians were yesterday warned they should never ignore sex crimes against children out of a misguided fear of being called racist. Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools and children’s services, said saving youngsters from exploitation required ‘political and moral courage’ on the part of local leaders. ‘They must never allow misguided beliefs about the impact for certain ethnic and cultural groups to get in the way of confronting this horrific abuse wherever it occurs,’ he added. His warning came amid the row over the failure of social workers, politicians or police to act against gangs of mostly Pakistani men who exploited hundreds of children in Rotherham and Oxford. An inquiry last month said Rotherham councillors shied away from the issue for fear of being accused of disturbing ‘community cohesion’. It added: ‘By failing to take action against the Pakistani heritage male perpetrators of child sexual exploitation in the borough, the council has inadvertently fuelled the far-Right.’ Last week an inquiry into a similar scandal in Oxford, carried out by the head of the local safeguarding board, said there was ‘no evidence of any agency not acting when they should have done because of racial sensitivities’. But the Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner accused it of ‘pulling its punches’. Sir Michael’s warning was contained in an Ofsted report that found most local councils charged with looking after children’s safety are failing at the job. Only ten out of 43 inspected over the course of a year were found to give a good standard of care and protection. Criticised: Rotherham's director of children's services between 2008 and 2014 Joyce Thacker (left) and former Rotherham Council leader Roger Stone (right) were both criticised for their inaction over the scandal . Sir Michael said youngsters who go missing from children’s homes while in council care are disproportionately at risk of abuse but social workers in some areas still fail to take notice of them. He added: ‘We found children and young people who had been missing were either not having an interview on their return or having one that was of poor quality. 'There was no clear understanding of why children had gone missing.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw said ‘political and moral courage’ is needed in future .

"A Washington D.C. tech entrepreneur has recalled his anger at learning his former Playmate wife had died in a hot tub after a night of sex, cocaine and drinking with her lover. Gary Hensley, 37, detailed the heart-wrenching moment he found out his wife Cassandra had died and the challenges he has faced as a single father to her two children from a previous relationship. 'I'll always miss her,' Hensley told the Washington Post. Cassandra Lynn Hensley, who was named a Playboy Playmate of the Month in 2006, had flown from the couple's home to Los Angeles to attend Playboy's 60th anniversary party in January 2014. Family: Gary Hensley is widowed and a single dad to his step-children, Alexis and Devin, pictured, following the death of his wife, former Playboy Playmate Cassandra Lynn, in January 2014 . But after taking part in a photo shoot, the 34-year-old headed to a photographer's apartment, had sex with him and  binged on drugs and alcohol, TMZ previously reported. In the early hours of the next morning, the photographer woke up and found Cassandra unconscious in the bathtub. Emergency responders were unable to resuscitate her and she was pronounced dead. Gary Hensley, who met Cassandra when they were neighbors in 2007, was home with her two children, Alexis and Devin, then 12 and six, when an acquaintance messaged him asking: 'Is it true?' Moments later, two police officers turned up on his doorstep and explained that his wife had been found dead in Los Angeles - although they would not reveal the circumstances. 'I just had this overwhelming sense of wanting to be next to her,' he told the Washington Post's Ellen McCarthy. Questions: Hensley is pictured with his wife, who was found dead in a hot tub after a night of sex, drugs and alcohol with her lover in Los Angeles. He said he is still haunted by questions of how much she loved him . Playmate: Cassandra, pictured with Hugh Hefner, had been named a Playmate of the Month in 2006 . But after calling the coroner, he learned the lurid details of her death. He said his reaction was anger - because he didn't know how he was going to raise the children without her. 'I was so angry at her,' he said. 'I was like, ""What am I going to do? How am I going to raise the kids? How do I get Alexis through prom and her wedding and all those things you're not going to be there for?""' Today Hensley, who has since learned that the affair had been going on for a while, is still haunted by questions of how much his wife loved him. 'A year past all that, I just have come to the resolve that for the five years we were together, she did - to the degree that she could,' he told the Post. 'And nobody's perfect. Neither am I.' He knew Cassandra had struggled with drugs and alcohol when she was younger and, in the months before her death, he noticed that she had started drinking again. Hensley, who launched a tech start-up that was later acquired by Pearson Education, said his job's uncertainty, problems in her own career and their move to Washington D.C., where Cassandra was judged for her past, had been tough on her. Struggles: He said that before her death, Cassandra (pictured in 2007) had struggled with problems in her career and in their new life in Washington D.C., where she was not accepted because of her past . Cassandra, who worked as an event hostess before her death, started drinking again, including the night before she flew to California. They didn't talk that night, Hensley said, but she texted him after heading to the airport to say that she loved him. After her death, he eventually returned to their home with the children, whom he had been raising as his own. Their biological father had not wanted custody, the Post reported. 'It was a very quiet, very lonely, very clean house,' he said. 'Nights were particularly hard.' He took time from work and tried to bring some normalcy to the children's lives, figuring out how to talk to them about the tragedy, and getting through the days with the help of family and friends. He said they've now 'got it down' and the children both call him 'Dad'. 'It always makes me smile,' he said.","Gary Hensley, 37, was at home with Cassandra Lynn's two children when he learned that she had died in Los Angeles in January 2014 .

"While Apple was unveiling its Watch yesterday, some of the biggest names in technology were showing off their own wearable devices in London. The likes of Samsung and Intel are at the annual Wearable Technology Show (WTS) alongside smaller firms and startups. Devices on show include Samsung's virtual reality headset, a Bluetooth medical splint and a bag that warns owners if they've left something at home. The likes of Samsung and Intel are at the annual Wearable Technology Show (WTS) alongside smaller firms and startups. Devices on show include Samsung's Gear virtual reality headset (pictured), a Bluetooth medical splint and a bag that warns owners if they've left something at home . WTS is the industry's largest event, with more than 100 companies displaying their products, and it is taking place at the ExCel exhibition centre in London. Among those at the show is European 10,000m champion Jo Pavey, 41, who is testing the latest in smart training devices. In particular she has been trying out Intel's £130 SMS Biosport earphones that work with a smartphone app to measure running pace and heartbeat. The latter normally means wearing a bulky and uncomfortable device on a chest strap, she said. Elsewhere Samsung has been showing off its Gear VR headset and Gear S smartwatch. The watch has been discussed a lot over the past 24 hours since its main rival Apple launched its own first wearable. The Gear S has a 2-inch curved screen and can be used to show messages and notifications from a connected phone at a glance. There is also a port for a nano SIM that gives the watch its own mobile network, and the screen can be customised - as well as the colour of the straps. Samsung's Gear VR uses the 5.7-inch Quad HD display of a Galaxy Note 4 mounted into the specially designed headset to enter virtual worlds. The Korean firm also recently unveiled it Gear VR Innovator Edition. Both are powered by Oculus Rift technology but the Innovator is 15 per cent smaller than the Gear VR .

Another product on show is a prototype handbag fitted with sensors that can warn a user if an item they usually carry with them has been left at home . Optimised to work with the latest S6 and S6 Edge handsets, the Innovator has reduced pixilation to make images appear more realistic and a wider field-of-view. Samsung has also redesigned the Innovator model to give a better weight balance making it more comfortable to wear. Some of the smaller names showcasing their devices at WTS include Burg, Osteoid and Sunfriend. Dutch firm Burg make a range of smartwatches for children and seniors, created by lifestyle designer Hermen van den Burg. Its latest $129 Burg 31 is fitted with GPS and offers one-touch emergency calls and speed dialing of up to three pre-set numbers without the use of a connected phone. The watch makes and receives calls using a SIM card, but it can also be paired with Android phones, iPhones and other smartphones to place calls via Bluetooth. The water-resistant device additionally lasts for two days on standby. The Osteoid splint, designed by Turkey-based Deniz Karasahin, perfectly fits to a patient's arm using 3D scans. This data is transferred to modelling software, which determines the overall size and geometry of the finished cast. Once printed, a locking mechanism and algorithmically generated ventilation holes are added. The Osteoid splint (pictured) perfectly fits to a patient's arm using 3D scans. A low intensity pulsed ultrasound (Lipus) bone stimulator is then placed directly on a patient's skin. The company said that spending just 20 minutes a day in the cast reduces healing time by up to 38% . Sunfriend's UVA=B wristband is said to negate the need for suncream by monitoring the wearer's exposure to UV rays. Wearers begin by entering their skin tone and skin sensitivity, on a scale of 1 to 11. Sensors monitor UV levels and LEDs light up gradually.

"The family of a 17-year-old California girl who was brutally raped and murdered in 1983 have finally found justice, after a man was found guilty this week of the 'cruel and senseless death'. Christopher Holland, 59, is now facing life in prison without parole and will be sentenced next month for raping, stabbing and strangling San Jose teen Cynthia Munoz over three decades earlier. The jury spent two days deliberating, before handing down the guilty verdict. Munoz was found dead in her bedroom insider her home in Campbell. She had just returned home from visiting her quadriplegic boyfriend in the hospital when she was attacked. Holland and a friend were regular visitors to the home. Guilty: Christopher Holland, 59, is now facing life in prison without parole and will be sentenced next month for raping, stabbing and strangling San Jose teen Cynthia Munoz over three decades ago . However, due to technology at the time, DNA could not link him to the crime, even though proper samples were collected and stored. Investigators were able to arrest Holland after retrieving DNA samples from his brother, David Leonard Holland, and another brother. Y chromosomes are almost always the same among men who have the same father. Rape and murder: Holland was convicted of killing Cynthia Munoz in August 1983 . In a shock twist, David Holland was also arrested, after his DNA linked him to the 2001 rape of an 81-year-old woman, according to reports. David Holland was convicted in that case and is now serving out a sentence in state prison, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. Christopher Holland was arrested in 2007. He was found hiding in the closet of a San Jose apartment. His trial started in January. Holland's lawyers tried to argue that he and Munoz had consensual sex, and that a robber must have killed her after he left. However the prosecution said Munoz was too devoted to her boyfriend to cheat on him, and brought in several women who were former sex partners of Holland to testify. The women - four total - all said Holland used a knife and choked them during unreported rapes. The behavior was similar to the injuries and abuse that Munoz had suffered, the court heard. 'Cynthia Munoz's family has waited 31 years to find justice for her cruel and senseless death,'Christopher Walsh, Santa Clara County deputy district attorney, told The Chronicle in a statement. 'Today a jury held Christopher Holland accountable for her murder and (has) hopefully given Cynthia's loved ones some measure of peace.' Holland has also been charged with the 1983 rape and murder of another young woman, 21-year-old San Jose resident Tara Marowski, who was found dead four months before Munoz. Holland is yet to stand trail on those charges. He refused to be present in court as the verdict was handed down. 'He's scared to death,' his lawyer Michael Ogul, said, according to the San Jose Mercury News. 'He can't handle being out here.'","Christopher Holland, 59, was convicted of the first-degree murder and rape of 17-year-old Cynthia Munoz on August 7, 1983 .

"It’s easy to let your speed creep upwards when driving on a quiet motorway, but being caught on speed camera can be expensive. To solve the problem Ford has introduced a setting in its latest car model to stop drivers accidentally exceeding speed limits. The built-in device, called the Intelligent Speed Limiter, automatically detects road signs and cameras and slows the car down where necessary. Scroll down for video . Ford has introduced a built-in device called the Intelligent Speed Limiter to its new S-Max model, which automatically detects road signs and cameras and slows the car down where necessary. This image shows the system display on the dashboard, where the maximum speed is set at 50mph (80km/h) It does this by using a windscreen-mounted camera to monitor road signs and when the speed limit is lower than that maximum set speed. Drivers have to manually set a maximum speed using controls on the steering wheel, so they might choose 70mph (113km/h) for a motorway, for example. As speed limit rises, from small roads to highways, the system allows the driver to accelerate up to the set speed, providing it does not exceed the new speed limit, or the maximum limit set by the driver. The speed limiter is essentially a variation of a cruise control setting and allows the driver to set a maximum speed for the car. The system, in the S-Max car (pictured) is essentially a variation of a cruise control setting and allows the driver to set a maximum speed for the car . If the on board technology detects a lower speed limit is in place, on a motorway for example, then it slows the car down to that speed  (illustrated) and then increases it if and when the limit goes up again . The Intelligent Speed Limiter can be controlled via controls on the steering wheel. Drivers manually set a maximum speed. The maximum speed is automatically adjusted from the traffic sign recognition system. This uses cameras to read road signs and restrictions that are taken on-board by the instrument. Cars with a built-in GPS can also use map data to support the system, particularly on roads where there are few speed signs. The system controls speed using engine torque, electronically adjusting the amount of fuel delivered, rather than applying the brakes. If the vehicle accelerates past its maximum speed limit on a hill, an alarm sounds so the driver can take action. If the on board technology detects a lower speed limit is in place - on a motorway for example - then it slows the car down to that speed and then increases it if and when the limit goes up again. The Intelligent Speed Limiter communicates with an on-board navigation system to glean extra data in order to help it accurately maintain the appropriate maximum speed when distances between speed limit signs are greater, for example on long country roads. Ford claims the system could save drivers from picking up speeding tickets or getting pulled over by the police for going too fast. ‘Drivers are not always conscious of speeding and sometimes only becoming aware they were going too fast when they receive a fine in the mail or are pulled over by law enforcement,’ said Ford Europe safety supervisor, Stefan Kappes. ‘Intelligent Speed Limiter can remove one of the stresses of driving, helping ensure customers remain within the legal speed limit.’ The limiter works between speeds of 20mph and 120mph and the speed is reduced by restricting the amount of fuel supplied to the engine, making deceleration smoother. The Intelligent Speed Limiter communicates with an on-board navigation system to glean extra data in order to help it accurately maintain the appropriate maximum speed when distances between speed limit signs are greater. The system is designed to stop people being caught by speed cameras (stock image) If the car goes downhill and picks up speed that cannot be restricted this way, then an alarm will sound so that the driver can apply more braking. Drivers can override the system by firmly putting their foot down on the accelerator. The Intelligent Speed Limiter combines two current Ford technologies – the Adjustable Speed Limiter and Traffic Sign Recognition, which are available on Focus, Mondeo and Kuga models. The S-Max model can also detect a person or object in the road ahead and slam the brakes on if the driver does not do so themselves. Ford executive technical leader Pim van dr Jagt said: ‘We’re not just developing cars at Ford, we’re also developing technologies to make driving more convenient, safer, and ultimately help improve mobility around the world.’ The S-Max with the new technology can now be ordered from £24,545.","Device, called Intelligent Speed Limiter comes in the new S-Max model .

"Israel has been accused of spying on White House nuclear talks with Iran and then leaking details to Republicans in Congress in an effort to scupper the deal. President Obama's administration, along with Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain, have been engaged in highly confidential talks with Iran. However, Israel's security services have been accused of relaying information gleaned from the talks to Republicans in Congress. Scroll down for video . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nethanyahu flew to the United States earlier this month to lobby President Barack Obama, right, about Tel Aviv's concerns over any potential deal with Iran over their nuclear ambitions . Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, pictured, said at the weekend  there was 'nothing that can't be resolved' Leading Republican senator Linsdey Graham, pictured, warned President Obama against signing a deal without first bringing the proposal to Congress to allow proper scrutiny of any agreement . Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took time out from his re-election campaign to directly lobby U.S. President Barack Obama and senior members of Congress to highlight Israel's opposition to any proposed deal. Upon his return to Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu said: 'After my short visit to the United States, I return to Israel knowing that many around the world heard what Israel has to say about the impending deal with Iran.' Mr Nethanyahu wanted any proposed deal dependent upon Iran denouncing terrorism world wide and ceasing its ongoing sponsorship of jihadi organisations. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. intelligence agencies discovered Israeli officials discussing information that could have only been gathered from inside the confidential talks. A senior U.S. official told the Wall Street Journal: 'It is one thing for the U.S. and Israel to spy on each other. It is another thing for Israel to steal U.S. secrets and play them back to U.S. legislators to undermine U.S. diplomacy . A White House source said: 'People feel personally sold out. That’s where the Israelis really better be careful because a lot of these people will not only be around for this administration but possibly the next one as well.' A spokesman for Mr Netenyahu rejected the espionage claims. 'These allegations are utterly false. The state of Israel does not conduct espionage against the United States or Israel’s other allies. The false allegations are clearly intended to undermine the strong ties between the United States and Israel and the security and intelligence relationship we share.' This denial was reiterated by the country's outgoing Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman: 'This report is not true. Obviously Israel has security interests to defend and we have our own intelligence. But we do not spy on the United States. There are enough participants in these negotiations, including Iranians. 'We got our intelligence from other sources, not from the United States. The instruction has been clear for decades now: you don’t spy on the United States, directly or indirectly.' U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, has been engaged in the high level negotiations with Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, right, in Lausanne, Switzerland. The talks are expected to resume tomorrow . The Israeli government has strongly denied spying on the talks which are being held in Switzerland . However, reaction in Congress among Republicans to possible deal with Iran has been hostile, with one senior senator warning that the White House faces 'a violent backlash' if it bypasses Washington and instead brings the deal to the United Nations. The negotiations concern a promise to loosen economic sanctions on Tehran if the Iranian administration pledges to cease development of nuclear weapons. Republican senator Lindsey Graham threatened to pass legislation in the Senate in April to require congressional oversight of any deal before it can be brought to the U.N. The deal is being discussed by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and if agreement is reached, it is expected that it will receive the full backing of the United Nations. Senator Graham told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York: 'That would be met with a violent response in the Congress. I don't think that's good for the country - to take a deal that could affect world order to an international body before you take it to your own people.' Republican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced the bipartisan bill to give Congress a vote on any agreement reached. The bill would require the president to submit the text of any agreement to Congress and would prohibit the administration from waiving any of the congressional sanctions for 60 days. During that time, lawmakers could hold hearings and approve, disagree or take no action on the deal. Israel wants any deal to include the dismantling of Iran's nuclear weapon development programme . Senator Corker, who introduced the measure with Democratic Senators Bob Menendez and Tim Kaine of Virginia and Graham, already wrote to Mr Obama warning him not to try to by-pass Congress. In a letter, Senator Corker told President Obama that letting the U.N. consider such an agreement - while at the same time threatening to veto legislation that would allow Congress to vote on it - would be a 'direct affront' to the American people and would undermine the role of Congress. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that substantial progress had been made on a possible deal, claiming 'there is nothing that cannot be resolved'. The talks are taking place in Lausanne, Switzerland, and are expected to resume tomorrow after a two-day break. Israel's Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz has flown to Paris to directly lobby the French over the deal. He said that dialogue with France in the past over Iran's nuclear ambitions have proven 'productive' in the past. He said: 'We don't have a plan B, we only have a plan A and this is to try to prevent a bad deal with Iran or at least to try to make it more reasonable and to close some of the gaps and loopholes that made it even worse.' Israeli diplomats believe that the United States is willing to do a deal with Iran. Israeli officials claim they are only interested d in proposal which 'dismantles, not simply freezes' Tehran's nuclear weapon programme. Former Israeli ambassador to Germany Shimon Stein added: 'It's only natural that given Netanyahu's concern of a deal with Iran that he would turn to France. France is the weak link among the group.'","Israel has been accused of spying on the U.S. over Iran nuclear talks .

"Frustrated users of the App Store, Mac App Store and iTunes around the world were unable to download songs and apps from Apple's sites for much of the day. The services were down for approximately eleven hours and the long outage may have cost Apple millions of dollars in lost sales. Apple has revealed technical problems caused by an internal DNS error - although all service have now been restored. Error: Outage is thought to be affecting would-be customers in the UK, US, Canada, India and other regions . Apple also confirmed in an update on its status page that the issue was global. This morning, the page claimed that all services were functioning well - despite there being problems - but it has now been updated to show that the App Store, iTunes Store, Mac App Store and iBooks Store are all 'unavailable to all users'. This afternoon, Apple issued a statement, saying: 'We apologise to our customers experiencing problems with iTunes and other services this morning. 'The cause was an internal DNS error at Apple. We’re working to make all of the services available to customers as soon as possible, and we thank everyone for their patience.' Currently music, film and TV content is visible in the iTunes Stores, but users can’t  buy it. Some users have seen error messages, while others are simply unable to download the goods they want in the digital stores. The front pages of both the App Store and Mac App Store are accessible, but there are broken pages on the sites when accessing individual apps. Currently some customers simply see a spinning circle indicating that a song is in the process of being downloaded, but nothing happens. Others are shown an error page saying that content cannot be displayed, or that the store is temporarily unavailable and could not complete their request, when they try to download an album. The status page also reveals that some users had problems accessing their iCloud mail this morning and may have been unable to sign in. This morning, Apple's status page claimed that all its services were functioning well - despite there being problems - but it has now been updated to show that the App Store, iTunes Store, Mac App Store and iBooks Store are all 'unavailable to all users' A post from Californian tech giant's Apple Support twitter handle said: 'APP STORE ISSUE: You may be receiving an error this morning. Apple are currently working on this and we do apologise.' In 2014 Apple revealed in that it had made $18.06 billion in revenue from iTunes, including its software and services, making up 10 per cent of Apple's total net sales. If this year's revenues match 2014's, the firm could be losing more than $2 million an hour  - equivalent to $34,000 every minute. London-based social media analyst Tim Grimes tweeted: 'Based on 2014 iTunes Revenue: Apple are losing $34,246 per minute, $2,054,794 per hour the #iTunes store is down.' Seeing as the outage encompasses other services, it could follow that Apple's losses are much higher than this. Tim Cook has previously said that the App Store posted $4.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014, which means that firm could also be losing around $2 million an hour, or almost $35,000 a minute. Frustration: In both iTunes and the App store, users simply see a spinning circle indicating that a song or app is in the process of being downloaded, but nothing happens, as shown in the screenshots above . One person tweeted: 'If iTunes doesn't start working within the next two hours I will literally cry...' while another said 'iTunes store has been down for like 2 hours.' A user called MisterDanD said: ' iTunes, App Store is DOWN worldwide, which is screwing up my morning! has someone hacked them? #apple #iTunes' and a user called lightcap wrote: 'Apple's app store is down (for purchasing, not browsing), but the world's most useless site remains useless as ever...' posting a link to the company's status page. Making a humorous reference to Apple's new MacBook, which was unveiled with just one port earlier this week, Twitter user schwarztech said: 'Maybe someone accidentally unplugged the single USB-C cable that the App/iBook Storer runs off of?' The outage appears to have been ongoing for several hours this morning, according to The Next Web, which said that iBooks and in-app purchases can't be accessed. TestFlight - a service used by developers to test apps - is also down, as well as Apple Support, meaning it is hard for customers to get help in accessing the services. Earlier today the problems seem to be geographically inconsistent. For example, it's been reported that it's possible to download apps from the Indian App Store, but music tracks are inaccessible. But now Apple has said the outage is affecting all its users across the world, but has yet to respond to MailOnline's request for comment. The App Store was last down on Monday, but the move was intentional as Apple prepared to launch its Apple Watch in San Francisco.","App Store and iTunes users have taken to Twitter to complain they are unable to download songs and apps from Apple's sites .

"Ryanair is poised to become the first airline to use a so-called ‘ghost airport’ on Spain’s eastern coast which has been ignored by other carriers. Spanish media said Europe’s largest budget airline will operate flights between Castellon-Costa Azahar Airport and destinations in Britain, Germany and Sweden. A Ryanair spokesperson told MailOnline Travel that an announcement will take place tomorrow. Castellon-Costa Azahar Airport has become a symbol of wasteful public spending and Spain's  debt . The spokesperson said: 'Ryanair does not comment upon or engage in rumour or speculation. However, I can confirm we are holding a press conference in Castellon tomorrow, 11th March.' Castellon-Costa Azahar Airport has barely been used since it opened four years ago, and has become a symbol of reckless government spending and Spain’s debt. It was built at a cost of £130million and declared open in March 2011, even though no airlines were signed on as tenants and it had not received government approval to operate. It received that approval late last year and since December it has been used for charter flights operated by Spanish football clubs Barcelona and Villarreal, but it has not welcomed any commercial flights. Citing unnamed sources, ABC said Ryanair will begin operating from the airport at the start of the Easter holiday season, and local officials are hoping the deal will bring more tourists to the region. The airport was heavily criticised for a 79-ft tall statue built next to the  only runway at a cost of £200,000 . The airport’s operator, Canadian multinational SNC-Lavalin, has set a goal of 250 flights and 35,000 passengers in its first year, the newspaper said. Castellon-Costa Azahar Airport has been plagued with problems and the subject of fierce criticism since the day it was inaugurated in March 2011. Officials were lambasted for a 79-ft tall statue built next to the terminal’s only runway at a cost of £200,000, and for spending £25million on publicity even though the airport had failed to secure necessary permits required for air traffic. The airport was developed by provincial politician Carlos Fabra, who was jailed for tax fraud last year . Its airstrip was found to be too narrow for aeroplanes to turn around, meaning it had to be torn up and widened to meet industry regulations. While it was deserted and facing an uncertain future, there were suggestions that it be transformed into a race track for cars or a shopping mall. Located 60 miles north of Valencia, the airport was developed by Carlos Fabra, the former head of Castellon’s provincial government, who was jailed for tax fraud last year. The airport's operators are have set a target of 250 flights and 35,000 passengers in its first year . The airport's statue is said to be a representation of Fabra. It is found in a region already served by busy international airports in Valencia and Alicante, but SNC-Lavalin, which signed a 20-year, £20million deal to run the facility, predicts that it will host 450,000 passengers in 2019. SNC-Lavalin said Castellon’s government will not make any money on the airport until it exceeds 1.2 million passengers a year, which isn’t expected until 2029.","Castellon-Costa Azahar Airport has been empty since it opened in 2011 .

"David Cameron is facing calls to sack a Tory candidate who dressed up as the convicted killer Oscar Pistorius – complete with fake blood and full South African athletics kit. Gregg Peers, who is standing for the Conservatives in a Cumbria County Council by-election two weeks before the general election, posted the fancy dress picture on his Facebook page. Labour MPs said it was 'stomach churning' to see a prospective Tory councillor making light of a man who gunned down his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day two years ago. Gregg Peers, who is standing for the Conservatives in a Cumbria County Council by election two weeks before the general election, posted the fancy dress picture on his Facebook page . Mr Peers has previously stood for election in Newcastle and is the agent to the Tory parliamentary candidate for Barrow and Furness Simon Fell. A Conservative Party spokesman this afternoon attacked Mr Peers' fancy dress choice. He said: 'This is unacceptable and in poor taste. The candidate has apologised and taken the picture down.' But Labour shadow minister Liz Kendall said the Conservative Party needed to immediately discipline the candidate. She said: 'Oscar Pistorious is rightly serving time in prison for killing Reeva Steenkamp - it is stomach churning to see a man who wants to hold elected office making a joke out of the death of a woman. 'David Cameron must show he takes violence against women seriously by taking immediate action against his candidate, and the Conservatives must explain why they promoted him to senior positions in their party.' Oscar Pistorius is facing a fresh murder trial for the killing of his model girlfriend after prosecutors appealed against his manslaughter conviction . Former Olympian sprinter Oscar Pistorius posing with his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at Melrose Arch in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2013 just a month before he shot and killed her . Pistorius is facing a fresh murder trial for the killing of his model girlfriend after prosecutors appealed against his manslaughter conviction. Prosecutors in South Africa want Pistorius convicted of murder for shooting his girlfriend multiple times in a bathroom in his home on Valentine's Day in 2013. Labour shadow minister Liz Kendal said David Cameron should sack Mr Peers . In December, Judge Thokozile Masipa granted prosecutors permission to take the case to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal and challenge her own ruling to acquit Pistorius of murder and find him guilty instead of a lesser charge comparable to manslaughter. Pistorius's lawyers had argued that the judge should not have allowed that appeal. The Olympian and multiple Paralympic champion is currently serving a five-year prison sentence for culpable homicide, or negligent killing. The 28-year-old could be eligible for release from the jail in the capital, Pretoria, in August to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. If prosecutors succeed in their appeal against the culpable homicide conviction in the Supreme Court of Appeal and have it upgraded to murder, Pistorius would face a minimum of 15 years in jail. Judge Masipa, who presided over Pistorius's seven-month murder trial and the start of the appeal process by prosecutors, made her latest ruling after a short court session in Johannesburg. Pistorius's trial now looks set to be reviewed by a panel of judges at the Supreme Court of Appeal, which sits in the central city of Bloemfontein. No date has been given for that appeal but cases can sometimes take two years to reach the court, legal experts have said.","EXCLUSIVE: Gregg Peers standing for the Tories in council elections .

"Dame Esther (pictured) was giving evidence in trial of Penny Mellor who allegedly sent hundreds of abusive tweets to campaigner Shy Keenan . Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen has denied that she was told about Jimmy Savile's child sex abuse in 1986 while giving evidence in a cyber stalking trial. Dame Esther today discussed allegations by child sex abuse victim and justice campaigner Shy Keenan that were printed on the front page of the Sun under the headline 'Abuse campaigner: I told Esther Rantzen about paedo Jimmy Saville 18 years ago.' She said she 'would have remembered' if she had been told by Ms Keenan that Saville, Gary Glitter and Jonathan King were child abusers. If she had been told of such an 'explosive allegation' Dame Esther said she would have told her to go to the police. Dame Esther was giving evidence in the trial of Penny Mellor, 53, from Coven, Wolverhampton, who is alleged to have sent hundreds of abusive tweets to Ms Keenan. Ms Keenan, from Colchester, Essex, wrote a book in 2008 called Broken, where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather. The revelation led to the conviction of Stanley Claridge and others in 2002 and Ms Keenan set up her own organisation, Phoenix Post, with campaigner Dr Sara Payne, whose daughter was murdered. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Mellor has accused Ms Keenan of repeatedly lying in her book, claiming she was a fraudster and an attention seeker. Mellor called Dame Esther as a witness to challenge Ms Keenan's credibility. Dame Esther, wearing a navy dress and black jacket, spent nearly an hour in the witness box today. She told the jury that she had not met Mellor before today, although Mellor had sent her some unsolicited emails about her discoveries relating to Ms Keenan. Dame Esther told the court she 'would have remembered' if she had been told in 1986 by Ms Keenan that Jimmy Savile (pictured left) and Gary Glitter (right) were child abusers . Dame Esther told the court: 'The Sun journalist told me Shy Keenan told them that I said they were too rich, too powerful and that I, Esther Rantzen, could do nothing about it. 'I said that's absolutely untrue. I never took the view that anyone was too rich or too powerful. I have a track record in this.' Dame Esther told the jury at Chelmsford Crown Court that she did not remember meeting Ms Keenan, who had been a guest on her TV show That's Life . She said she was concerned that the claim would taint and damage Childline's reputation. Dame Esther said she was told when she was a young TV researcher, of 'a rumour' in Fleet Street that Savile was interested in young girls, but that she did not hear anything to justify or corroborate the rumour. She said that the first time she heard evidence of Savile's abuse was on an ITV Exposure documentary in October 2012, a year after his death. She agreed there was a photograph of her with Ms Keenan, taken in the BBC hospitality room in 1986, but said she didn't remember meeting her, and categorically denied the claim. Dame Esther said: 'Eighteen years ago nobody told me anything about Jimmy Savile's predilections. 'Shy Keenan didn't talk to me about Jimmy Savile in the BBC hospitality room when she was a guest.' Dame Esther added she attended the Women of the Year lunch at which Dr Sara Payne and Ms Keenan received an award. Shy Keenan (pictured left) wrote a book in 2008 called Broken, where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather. Penny Mellor (right) allegedly claims that Ms Keenan 'repeatedly lied' in her book . Mellor denies stalking Ms Keenan and causing her serious alarm or distress between January 1 and 16 March 2013 by sending tweets, publishing statements about her in emails sent to work associates and carrying out a course of conduct which had a substantial effect on Ms Keenan's day to day activities. Mellor, who is defending herself, claims that Ms Keenan lied in her autobiography Broken, and alleges that she is making money fraudulently out of the book and is an 'attention seeker, Munchausen by internet'. She also claims that the graphic book is 'titillation for paedophiles', that Ms Keenan should not have written such an account which her own children can read, and ought to be withdrawn. The jury heard the trigger for Mellor's 239 tweets was when Dame Esther was accused in 2012 by Ms Keenan of being 'a liar' and of having known about Jimmy Savile's behaviour. Dame Esther told the court Ms Keenan went to the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC) and Dame Esther was briefly removed from the website as patron before being  reinstated. Dame Esther told the court : 'I am still a patron. Nevertheless Ms Keenan told the press that I had been removed and then the papers ran that but that was not true either.' She said that the allegation was damaging to the work of NAPAC and the NSPCC, as Childline is linked to both. The court heard a fund-raising event for Childline was even cancelled because the organisers believed it 'was in some way involved or was tainted by the allegations made by Shy Keenan'. Dame Esther said she had appeared on ITV's This Morning programme to answer Ms Keenan's allegations but said that Ms Keenan had refused to appear at the same time. Dame Esther said her daughter had defended her on Twitter from attacks by Shy Keenan and her organisation Phoenix Post. Penny Mellor's own campaign group, Dare to Care, supports those falsely accused of fabricating illness, which is known as Munchausen by Proxy. The trial continues.

"A prestigious home in one of Sydney's most exclusive suburbs is on the market for $6 million more than it was asking for just eight months ago. Bought by property investor and dentist Le Tran in June for $14 million, the grand six-bedroom mansion at 9 Hillside Avenue Vaucluse in Sydney's eastern suburbs is now being offered for $20 million following a large-scale renovation. 'There have been extensive renovations done, it has basically been completely rebuilt inside, virtually,' Black Diamondz estate agent Brad Pillinger told Daily Mail Australia. The exclusive mansion at 9 Hillside Avenue Vaucluse in Sydney's eastern suburbs has been put on the market for $20 million . This is despite it last being purchased by dentist and property investor Le Tran only eight months ago for $14 million . Black Diamondz estate agent Brad Pillinger said that extensive renovations had been done to the home's interior since it was purchased . 'The floors, walls, appliances - basically everything. The whole internal layout has been re-done.' When asked if he believed it would snatch-up its multi-million dollar target, Mr Pillinger replied 'It'll go close'. Le Tran purchased the home from property developer Jacques Kurdian whose father bought it in 1976 for less than 1.5 per cent of the cost - $220,000, according to Review Property. But despite Le Tran selling his last home in Hunters Hill for $12.5 million before buying the exclusive, water-front home, Mr Pillinger said he hasn't even moved in. 'They have in mind a particular property they want to buy,' the estate agent said when asked by Daily Mail Australia for the reason of Le Tran's quick re-sale. 'The floors, walls, appliances - basically everything. The whole internal layout has been re-done,' he told Daily Mail Australia . The home features five bathrooms, a resort-style swimming pool, spa, sauna, wide terraces and a pool-side dining patio . When asked if he believed it would snatch-up its multi-million dollar target, Mr Pillinger replied 'It'll go close' Le Tran purchased the home from property developer Jacques Kurdian whose father bought it in 1976 for almost one 10th of the cost . 'The renovation has been finished and they were about to move in but they changed their mind and put it on the market.' With an enormous 1808 square metre land size and panoramic views of Sydney Harbour, it's no wonder that the castle-like home has had 'a lot of initial interest', according to Mr Pillinger. 'It has an unequal view of everything that is iconic in Sydney and it's particularly private.' The home features five bathrooms, a resort-style swimming pool, spa, sauna, wide terraces and a pool-side dining patio. Designed in a classical French provincial theme, it takes full advantage of its hill-top position by including  a stunning panoramic view which stretches right to Bondi Beach in one of the upper level bedrooms.

Though large doses of a puffer's neurotoxinthe can be deadly - 100 times more potent than cyanide - in small amounts it is known to produce a narcotic effect. To release the substance, the bottlenose dolphins were caught chasing the pufferfish along the ocean floor. In a bid to escape attack, footage shows the fish quickly inflating into a ball shape. The playful dolphins then grab the puffer between their teeth and pass it around until it eventually lets out a burst of poison. A brown-colored cloud is seen dispersing and diluting in the water.

Getting in on the act: Though large doses of a puffer's neurotoxinthe can be deadly - 100 times more potent than cyanide - in small amounts it is known to produce a narcotic effect . The footage, from Dolphins: Spy in the Pod, was taken by wildlife filmmaker John Downer - who has previously used hidden cameras to bring the secrets of penguin colonies to television screens. Downer designed underwater cameras disguised as squid, tuna and even other dolphins. Zoologist and series producer Rob Pilley said that it was the first time dolphins had been filmed behaving this way. He added: 'We saw the dolphins handle the puffers with kid gloves, very gently and delicately like they were almost milking them to not upset the fish too much or kill it. 'As a result the fish released various toxins as a defense. The dolphins then seemed to be mesmerized.' He insisted that the scene couldn't have been a one-off encounter, saying: 'The dolphins were specifically going for the puffers and deliberately handling them with care.' The series, which aired on the Discovery Channel on Saturday, follows the success of Penguins: Spy In the Huddle, which used similar tactics of disguised cameras, documentary producer Downer was eager to create a range of cameras disguised as sea creatures to offer viewers unprecedented proximity to their favorite species.

As well as the Dolphincam, the Tunacam, Turtlecam and Squidcam have also been created for different spying roles, with each fitted with HD cameras to capture life under the sea. With the help of the cameras, viewers can watch a mother teaching her calf to catch fish and leap from water, as well as finding themselves at the center of huge megapods with thousands of dolphins swimming around them at once. Some 900 hours of raw footage was collected over a 12-month period from locations including America, Coasta Rica, South Africa, Argentina and Australia. The pufferfish footage was filmed in waters near Mozambique. The film crew also dived some 1,500 times, spending nearly 3,000 hours at sea filming with the Spy Creatures in all types of weather. Speaking of the project, Downer said: 'Unlike Penguin-cams, this time our spy creatures had to keep pace with fast-moving dolphins, often out in the deep ocean. 'The dolphins were very curious about their new neighbors and allowed them into their lives.' Downer's last project, Spy in the Huddle, took viewers inside the world of penguins by deploying 50 cameras to the arctic for almost a year.","Hidden cameras captured a pod in action as they got 'high' from nerve toxins released by a pufferfish in waters off Southeast Africa .

"Air travellers today lampooned Ryanair's plans to offer £10 transatlantic flights by suggesting they may have to stand, pay to use the toilet or even parachute into America  because it is so cheap. The budget airline has announced it  plans to fly to New York, Boston, Chicago and Miami from London Stansted, Dublin and Berlin from 2020.

But despite a largely positive reaction online to the proposed transatlantic expansion, others have also used it to crack a joke at the frugal airline's expense. Some said that Ryanair's New York hub could be in Nova Scotia, Canada, or passengers may have to 'sky dive in and hope you don't land in the Hudson river' so the thrifty company can avoid landing costs. Others pondered how much people would be charged for not printing their own tickets, and if the £10 deal would include any food, leg room, entertainment or any luggage. Jason Bournemouth tweeted: 'It's Ryanair so New York means, at best, landing in New Jersey. Probably Iowa'. Mail columnist Andrew Pierce wrote: 'Ryanair to launch £10 flight to US. Plus £200 for luggage, £200 for seat, £1 to use loo'. Sandie Blicken replied: 'They don't actually land anywhere you just do a sky dive and hope you don't land in the Hudson'. The budget airline’s directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline as part of an ambitious growth strategy at Europe’s largest low-cost carrier over the next five years. The airline has set out proposals for one-way tickets costing from under £10, although some fares would be much higher. Ryanair says it is studying plans to fly between about a dozen European and US cities on a transatlantic service that could start ‘in four to five years’. Ryanair’s chief executive Michael O’Leary has talked over many years about his dream of setting up a transatlantic airline offering cheap ‘ten buck’ transatlantic fares – with $10 currently equivalent to £6.75. But the announcement that his board has now approved initial plans suggests the company is now more serious about going ahead with the ambitious strategy. O’Leary is particularly keen to win a slice of the lucrative long-haul transatlantic trade which is one of the most profitable routes in the world. The company said yesterday: 'European consumers want lower cost travel to the USA and the same for Americans coming to Europe. We see it as a logical development'. Outspoken: Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years. He has seen it through two decades of extraordinary growth . But it is dominated by long-established European and US airlines including British Airways, American Airlines and, on a smaller level, Virgin Atlantic, which is in partnership with America’s Delta. Pay-per-pee . In 2009, Mr O’Leary announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight. 'We’re thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to spend a pound to spend a penny.' When asked if he would charge more than a pound, he replied: 'If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet I would carry them myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver.'Vertical seats . A year later, the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would think of vertical seats, akin to bar stools with seatbelts. His theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 rows of vertical seats, flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers and slash costs by 20 per cent. Who needs co-pilots? Mr O'Leary once remarked that co-pilots were only there to 'make sure the first fella doesn’t fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls'. He said aviation authorities should axe the 'unnecessary' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as 'back-up' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight. Ryanair’s plan has echoes of 1970s cut-price pioneer Sir Freddie Laker whose cheap Skytrain flights to the USA transformed transatlantic travel for the masses, until it was effectively killed off by the established airlines, though it inspired Sir Richard Branson to launch Virgin Atlantic. Norwegian Air started its transatlantic service in 2013 two years ago with a one-way ticket from the UK to New York starting at £149. Ryanair has said it would fulfil its long-expressed promise of offering some bargain-basement transatlantic fares at £10, but other one-way tickets would be priced from £99 or more. In November Ryanair's profits soared by 32 per cent and its loud-mouth boss Michael O'Leary admitted: 'Being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy'. These have included demanding up to £5 to use the toilet and vertical seats to get more people on board. But last year, after two profits warnings, Mr O'Leary's promised that the company would 'stop unnecessarily p****** people off' and treating customers 'like the enemy'. O'Leary agreed to partially end the scramble to get on his planes by offering allocated seating for almost £5, relax the airline's draconian baggage allowance rules and a 'sophisticated' business service. He admitted that  to turn them around he would end the airline's 'over-abrupt', 'go to hell' culture. In 2012 he launched an extraordinary rant against his own customers – branding those who object to paying a penalty for failing to print their own boarding cards as ‘idiots’ who should ‘b***** off’. Her said passengers who arrive for flights without a pass are ‘stupid’ and it is right they are charged £60 a time to have one printed at the check-in desk because it is their ‘f*** up’. Budget: Ryanair’s chief executive Michael O’Leary has talked over many years about his dream of setting up a transatlantic airline . Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years. But in the past 18 month, under pressure over customer service, he has said he wants to change his ways. In Autumn 2013 a charm offensive backfired when the outspoken tycoon was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer session from customers. He posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets. Many customers told Mr O'Leary what an 'a***hole' they thought he was - with user Andrew Riddell asking him: 'Have you by any chance just hired British Gas's former head of publicity you Plum'. The Ryanair boss replied: 'Hey, don't call me plum. Pudding would be more accurate!', before later admitting: 'I'm an a***hole. But they still love me.'","Budget carrier plans to run services between European cities and the US .

"Britain's former tallest man was buried today in a bespoke coffin measuring almost 8ft long and remembered by friends as a 'gentle giant'. Actor Christopher Greener, from Bromley, south London, who grew to be 7ft 6in and a half inches and weighed up to 30 stone, died last month aged 71. More than 60 people attended his funeral today including members of the Tall Cub of Great Britain and eight pallbearers were needed to carry him. His best friend Berry Tolson, who met Mr Greener 50 years ago when they both played for the London Latvian Basketball Klub, said he was so tall he could put the ball into the net with no effort. Britain's former tallest man Christopher Greener was buried today in a bespoke coffin measuring almost 8ft long and eight pallbearers were needed to carry him . Mr Greener, who grew to be 7ft 6in and a half inches and weighed up to 30 stone, died last month, aged 71 . 'Chris, as my wife would say was a 'gentle giant', he was very funny, caring and kind and our whole family will miss him terribly. 'He struggled towards the end of his life with his health and found it increasingly difficult to get around. 'Mowing the lawn and day-to-day chores were extremely difficult for him being so extremely tall but he was always cheery and never stopped making us laugh. 'He even joked to Irene, my wife, that he expected getting a coffin to fit him could be difficult and that he wouldn't mind if we just got someone to 'break his legs'. 'My wife and I are thankful to Chris for all of the great memories that he has provided us with and we will never forget the gentle giant that we loved dearly.' The coffin (right) was made specifically for him and at least 10 pallbearers were needed to carry it as he also weighed 30 stone . Mr Greener had to be buried in a double plot of land, which is normally reserved for two people . Mr Greener had to be buried in a double plot of land, which is normally reserved for two people, at his parish church in Hayes, near Bromley, Kent. He was diagnosed at 27 with a condition known as pituitary gigantism where a tumour had grown on his pituitary gland, an organ that controls bodily functions including release of growth hormones. Surgeons removed the tumour when he was already in the record books for being UK's tallest man and he would have continued to grow if they had not. He played basketball internationally for Great Britain in the late 60s and early 70s and played the circus giant in David Lynch's film The Elephant Man. Mr Greener also starred in The Rainbow Thief and Birdie Blues as well as appearing in several documentaries chronicling the lives of the very tall. Mr Greener held the title of Britain's tallest man for four decades and is pictured  in 1996 outside the Market Weighton house once owned by Yorkshire's 7ft 9ins Giant William Bradley and later by Sylvia France (left) Mr Greener lost his title as Britain's tallest man in 2007. The 71-year-old spent the majority of his life towering over friends and family. He is pictured above at a friend's wedding . Fellow actor and friend Ross Sambridge, 7ft 1in tall, met Christopher at the Tall Club which he founded. Ross said 'He was a great guy, a real gent.' Matthew Uden Funeral Director from W.Uden and Sons said: 'I had the pleasure to find out about Christopher after I had a long chat with his friends, they described him as a gentle giant who had an enormous heart. 'The funeral went very well with some beautiful things being said about his life and antics, I am sure that he would have been pleased with his send off. 'Mr Greener was an extremely tall chap and we had 8 coffin bearers to carry him in to the church as opposed to the usual 4 or 6.' Mr Greener's height afforded him roles in films. Above, he is prepared for an appearance by a make-up artist . Mr Greener was buried at St Mary's Cemetery in Hayes, Bromley, earlier today and his friends described him as a 'gentle giant' Mr Greener towers over his father (left) who is stood on the front step of their home, both pictures talen in the Sixties . He held the title for 40 years and was replaced in 2007 by Neil Fingleton, who measures 7ft 7.56ins tall. Mr Fingleton, from Durham, also played basketball and is now an actor, having recently starred alongside Mila Kunis in Jupiter Ascending. Neither however beat the record of William Bradley, who at 7ft 9ins tall, was known as the Yorkshire Giant until his death in 1820. Last year Leonid Stadnyk, believed to be the world's tallest man at an estimated 8ft 5in tall, was carried to a graveyard on the back of an open truck because his remains were too large for a hearse. Throughout his life Mr Stadnyk, from Ukraine, had refused to be measured to determine his height because he said it would be humiliating. Among the activities Mr Greener was able to take part in was basketball where he shone on the court .

"An 800lb man, whose depression and size once brought him to the brink of suicide, vowed to lose 150lbs in order to qualify for the weight loss surgery needed to save his life after a series of dangerous falls sent him to the hospital 10 times in nine months. When Joe Wexler, 31, first joined TLC's obesity series My 600lbs Life, he was using food as an emotional crutch and consuming roughly 10,000 calories a day. And on last night's episode of the series, a weight loss specialist insisted that, if Joe had to get down to 650lbs, he would be unable to undergo the live-saving surgery he so desperately needed. But despite making the life-changing decision to move from Johnson City, Tennessee, to Houston, Texas, to be close to Dr Younan Nowzaradan, Joe struggled to shed the necessary weight - and actually managed to gain a further 15lbs in just one month. Scroll down for video . No hope: Joe Wexler, 31, can be seen calling an ambulance after he fell at his home in Johnson City, Tennessee.  At nearly 800lbs, he was unable to get up by himself . Team work: It took multiple emergency technicians to lift Joe off of the floor to take him to the hospital . 'I'm mad at myself,' Joe said tearfully. 'Not only did I not lose, but I gained. I am really scared.' During his appointment, Dr Nowzaradan attempted to address his patient's weight gain - however Joe continued to make excuses for his failure to follow orders. He blamed being on the road during the move to Houston, noting that he was forced to eat fast-food at convenient stores and rest stops. Joe alleged that he ate two grilled chicken sandwiches a day, but Dr Nowzaradan told him that his claims were mathematically impossible. 'Joe is still in denial about how much he is eating,' Dr Nowzaradan explained. 'He is still eating just as much, if not more.' He told his patient that he was on 'borrowed time' and 'spiraling out of control'. 'At this rate every day is a question as to whether he is going to make it,' Dr Nowzaradan said. 'Any number of things could [become] a deadly situation with him.' Daily chore: Joe can be seen getting dressed after bathing himself. He said he would rather die than have someone have to do that for him . Best friends: Joe's sister Annie came to visit him and make him lunch . Feeling lost: Annie cried while explaining that she felt unable to really help her brother . Fearing for Joe's safety, Dr Nowzaradan sent him for testing to ensure he was even healthy enough to return to his own home. And after Joe was cleared to leave his doctor's office, he was appointed a nutritionist to help him get his eating under control. During their first meeting, Joe admitted to her that his 'greatest struggle with food is emotional eating'. 'If I feel bad, I go to it,' he said. One of Joe's biggest emotional hardships was feeling rejected by his father. Joe had always struggled with his weight. As a child he longed for his father's attention, but his dad chose to shower him with gifts instead of his love. 'I would have given up every one of those things that I had if he would have paid me any attention,' Joe said. Smiling child: Joe said he was always chunky, noting that he struggled with his weight his entire life . Strained relationship: As a child, Joe longed for his father's attention, but he was given material items instead of affection . Slippery slope: Joe said he eats to deal with his feelings and his father's rejection . His sister Annie noted that he had always been big, but when their parents divorced his weight 'spiraled out of control'. 'If there was some way to fix him myself, I would,' she said tearfully. Joe explained that he had free reign to do whatever he wanted when was younger - and that included eating whatever he wanted. After hitting 777lbs, Joe was unable to walk without falling and his mom said his 'spirit had been broken'. At the start of the episode, he was forced to call an ambulance after his legs gave out and he had fallen to the floor. 'I feel like a prisoner inside this body,' Joe said. 'I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. When I fall I can't just get up on my own, so I have to call an ambulance. It's really embarrassing.' He used to work an I.T. job from home, but after his company told him he had to return to the office or he would lose his job, he was left unemployed. Huge shock: During his visit to weight loss surgeon Dr Nowzaradan's office in Houston, Texas, Joe was sad to learn that he weighed 777lbs . Big goal: Dr Nowzaradan told Joe and his mother Robin that he needed to get down to 650lbs to be a candidate for gastric bypass surgery . Helping hand: After gaining 15lbs, Dr Nowzaradan had Joe meet with a nutritionist who taught him how to read food labels properly . Joe had become a recluse and the only thing he was able to do on his own was bathe himself. 'I refuse to let anyone bathe me,' he said. 'It is the only thing I won't allow,' He added: 'I would rather die than make someone have to do that for me.' Joe admitted that he once considered killing himself after he saw a television program about a morbidly obese man who had died because of his weight. 'I was looking around trying to find some way to off myself,' he said. 'I kept thinking it would be better for everybody. I didn't care anymore.' After meeting with his nutritionist, Joe knew he was 'as good as dead' if he failed to lose weight. And slowly but surely he started to drop the pounds. His next appointment with Dr Nowzaradan showed that he lost 71lbs. Support system: Joe, who has had suicidal thoughts because of his size, met with a therapist to deal with his inner turmoil . Work it out: Joe also hired a trainer and visited the gym for the first time in his life . Although Joe was pleasantly surprised, he was reminded that he still had a long way to go in order to get down to 650lbs. He decided to keeping seeing a therapist in order to gain control of his emotional eating. 'A lot of stuff is coming up to the surface, and it is hard not to get depressed,' Joe explained. 'Last time I got this depressed I thought about hurting myself, and I don't want to end up in a place that dark again.' He added: 'I think about dying and leaving my mother and my sister behind and I refuse to do that to them. I refuse to let them bury me.' Joe, who has a habit of eating his feelings, said it was really good to talk to his therapist because it was something he had never done before. He also took the initiative to meet with a trainer and go to the gym for the first time in his life. 'I have faith that I am going to be able to do this,' he said. 'I just have to stick with it and keep fighting.' Major milestone: Joe was able to get down to 652lbs and was later approved for weight loss surgery . Next step: Dr Nowzaradan can be seen operating on Joe during his gastric bypass procedure . Fresh start: Joe happily walked out of the hospital after learning that he had lost 200lbs since the start of his journey . Because of his new found resolve to lose weight, he stopped asking his mother for food and started cooking himself healthier meals. He noted: 'Food is killing me when it should be doing the opposite of that, so I am trying to eat even healthier.' And his hard work paid off. The next time he met with Dr Nowzaradan he weighed 652lbs. The doctor scheduled his gastric bypass for the following week. 'If I could jump up and down for joy, I would right now,' Joe said. 'I am as happy as can be.' His mom cried tears of joy when she learned the news. Dr Nowzaradan reduced Joe's stomach size by 80per cent during the surgery. A week later, it was revealed that Joe lost even more weight and was down to 592lbs. 'I finally get to put to rest the curse that has followed me around since I was two years old,' he said. 'This begins the new chapter, and I can't wait to see where the book leads.'","Joe Wexler was told he needed to lose 150lbs if he wanted to undergo the procedure on last night's episode of My 600lb Life .

"Spending on the security services could be merged with the defence budget to hit a key Nato target, David Cameron indicated yesterday. The Prime Minister is under intense pressure from both his own MPs and former generals to guarantee that the Conservatives will continue to spend at least 2 per cent of Britain’s national income on defence. A study published yesterday revealed that Britain will miss the target by more than £2billion next year if current spending plans are maintained. Missing this figure would be deeply embarrassing for Mr Cameron, who lectured other Western leaders on the need to maintain defence spending at the Nato summit in Wales last year. But he indicated that he could hit the target by re-badging the £2billion budget for the security services as defence spending. Prime Minister David Cameron is under fire over claims Britain will fail to meet its Nato target of spending at least 2 per cent of its national income on defence next year . He told LBC radio: ‘I have a responsibility to make sure we make the right decisions about defence and other security spending. ‘I look at these things in the round, so I am also concerned about the budget for MI5, the Secret Intelligence Service, GCHQ, counter-terrorism policing. To me all of these things are part of our national defence.’ A study by the impartial House of Commons Library yesterday revealed that Britain will need to spend an additional £2.2billion on defence next year in order to hit the target – and an extra £1billion every year after that. It added that current plans suggest defence spending will otherwise represent only 1.87 per cent of national income next year. But former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth condemned the move as a ‘complete cop-out’. An RAF Typhoon fighter jets was scrambled to escort a Russian Bear bomber when it flew into UK airspace last month. There are fears a defence funding squeeze would leave the UK reluctant to tackle such incursions . He said last night: ‘No amount of fancy footwork or creative accountancy is going to fool anybody. Adding the security budget to defence will not produce a single extra bullet or soldier. ‘It doesn’t address the fundamental problem that the UK and our allies face very real threats – a resurgent Russia, complete turmoil in the Middle East and many other threats around the world. Former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth has condemned the move as a ‘complete cop-out’ 'If this idea goes ahead it will be seen by all for the gimmick that it is.’ Mr Cameron has faced repeated attacks over defence spending from former military leaders. The former head of the army, General Sir Peter Wall, warned that the funding squeeze was leaving the UK reluctant to tackle Russian incursions into its airspace and offshore waters. Another former Army chief, Lord Dannatt, said it would be ‘extraordinary’ for a Conservative government to fail to meet its commitments on defence. Mr Cameron yesterday showed his irritation at the comments – suggesting that some vocal critics were speaking out in order to promote their memoirs. He said: ‘Obviously they have their own book to talk – sometimes quite literally a book to talk – and sometimes they just want to make their views known.’ Tory rebels plan to force a Commons vote on defence spending tomorrow. Many are angered Mr Cameron has pledged to spend 0.7 per cent of our income on foreign aid, but will not make a firm commitment to meet the Nato target.","Britain will miss target by more than £2billion next year, says new study .

"A photographer has delved into the decaying bowels of the New York subway system and emerged with incredible shots of its abandoned tunnels. Gregory Berg, 21, was enticed by the Metro Transit Authority's empty stations and now regularly walks across live tracks to take his stunning glimpses of underground Gotham. The subway's third rail famously carries 625 volts of electricity and touching it means likely death for New Yorkers who don't listen to announcements reminding passengers 'do not go on to the tracks for any reason'. ''Death is a serious option down there,' Mr Berg told Daily Mail Online. However, he prefers taking risks in the subway's less crowded corners  to safely riding along in  busy cars and has been venturing down to the system's unseen parts for two years. Gregory Berg, a 21-year-old photographer in New York City, regularly makes his way into the deep abandoned corners of the metropolis's subway system . The urban spelunker said that his favorite type of shot is where trains create a blur of light as they go past empty stations like the one above . Mr Berg (pictured) goes down onto the tracks of the subway, but makes sure to be careful and avoid touching the third rail, which carries 625 volts of electricity . Some abandoned platforms, such as the unused area underneath 42nd street's ACE train stop, are within earshot of conversations happening at active stations . The urban photographer, who grew up in Manhattan and New Jersey, would not disclose how he reaches the abandoned platforms, though doing so often requires going on to live in-use tracks where speeding trains come every couple of minutes. His destinations are often within earshot of active stations, and he said that he can hear conversations on the 42nd street ACE platform when he is on an unused platform directly below it. Other spots are only reached by long walks on tracks underground. He acknowledged that what he does is 'very illegal' and said that he would never go shoot the tunnels without friends. Mr Berg first met up with a group of underground photographers when he was 19 after seeing one of their pictures on Instagram. His father was a model train enthusiast and now trains continue to be part of his life as he goes around the city with friends such as James Lanning. The snappers regularly receive requests to help hopeful urban explorers reach hidden spots of the subway, which Mr Berg calls 'the bando,' but doesn't offer help to those who don't know what they are doing and seriously hurt themselves. The skilled snapper said that while he may one day shoot commercial photography, though right now he is just focused on sharing his experiences in New York . The photographer said that visitors to the subway tunnels can emerge with their hands and teeth covered in dirt despite not having touched anything . The photographer is not interested in Internet fame, but uses his Instagram as a means of sharing his photos with like-minded people and creators . There is also 'another world' of graffiti artists and urban explorers who use the same tunnels for adventure, though some do not like photographers sharing photos of their secret spots . He has also had close encounters with workers in the subway, and one time narrowly escaped an abandoned platform before an employee with a flashlight called over a group of his coworkers to the spot Mr Berg had been minutes before. Beyond the dreaded third rail and police, there is always the threat of an approaching train in stations that cars still run through without stopping. He  said that fear of the subway's scarier side is 'only mental'. 'The senses are always raised; listening for trains, inhaling the scents of the city, the brain works fast and unimpeded,' he shared on Instagram. Mr Berg, who was homeless four years ago and is now sober after recovering from addiction, said that the adventures and the thrill he gets from his underground photography 'saved his life'. His website houses mementos his bravery, including many shots looking down the barrel of tunnels from which trains will shortly emerge. He said that people, especially New Yorkers, need to see a different side of their city. 'I just want to share my wild experiences with the world, and captivate the city with some truly great people-something photography is perfectly suited for.' Catching blurs of light from passing trains is his favorite type of shot. He said that he is in no rush to make more money by doing commercial photography, even though he has received offers to shoot weddings that could be lucrative. For now Mr Berg continues with the less glamorous realities of what he calls his job. He said that the subways were 'the dirtiest place you've ever been,' with the constant possibility of stepping on dead rats and more live rodents than you could imagine from looking at the critters scurrying around on active tracks. Mr Berg hopes his work lets New Yorkers, and people at large through social media such as Instagram, see a different side to the metropolis . Some hidden parts of the New York City subway system, which has been operating for more than a century, are only reached by long walks . Mr Berg said that his 'brain works fast and unimpeded' when he is down on the tracks and that the fear of oncoming trains or electric shock is 'only mental' The 21-year-old has had close encounters with getting caught after workers with flashlights suspected that someone was up to 'very illegal' activity . The tunnels are stifling hot in the summer and can become cold in the winter, though they are always capable get visitors dirty even without them touching anything. Often his hands and white smile are tainted black by dirt when he emerges after a night of shooting, often in the early hours of the morning. When people hear about Mr Berg's photos they often ask if he has seen the 'mole people' who live in the tunnels,  though he doesn't believe they exist. The strangest thing he has ever seen in the train system's death is a hole in the wall that spurts out water, but will suddenly fire out 500 cigarette butts in repeated intervals. His expertise with the subway has led more than 5,000 users to follow him on Instagram, but he says that the social network is an outlet to express himself and meet others with similar vision rather than achieving Internet fame. He is drawn to the underground because it is 'truly beautiful down there' and that his work has completely changed the way he feels when he rides the subway normally. Mr Berg often rides between subway cars (also very dangerous and illegal) to find unused tracks that will lead to more hidden underground gems. New York City's subway has dozens of closed stations and platforms in addition to more than 400 active ones. The most famous abandoned station is the former City Hall stop in lower Manhattan, Mr Berg's favorite. It was designed by architects Heins & Lafarge and still boasts the tiled archways and chandeliers it had before it was closed at the end of 1945, and very few have gotten to see its beauty up close since. The station sometimes has tours where it is lit up, but Mr Berg prefers to shoot as it is, with minimal light and the blur of passing by with hundreds of unsuspecting passengers who will soon take the stairs back to the world at street level. While Mr Berg has also shot photos dangling his toes from skyscrapers dozens of stories up, he says there is nothing that compares to exploring the underground. 'You would never believe what's right below you're feet,' he said. The photographer once found a hole in the wall that would spit out water punctuated by bursts of 500 cigarette butts at a time .

"Jailed: Matthew Hudson (above), 22, left his friend Mark Bennett with life-threatening injuries after attacking him with a glass at his sister's wedding . A man who smashed a pint glass into a friend's neck during his sister's wedding reception was jailed for three and half years today. Matthew Hudson, 22, left Mark Bennett with life-threatening injuries after  attacking him without warning as they walked out of a marquee set up in the grounds of a luxury farmhouse. Mr Bennett was left with shards of glass in his neck narrowly missing a vital artery and was aided by two trained nurses attending the wedding before being rushed to hospital and operated on. He said he was lucky to survive the attack  given the nature and location of his injuries. In a victim impact statement Mr Bennett said: 'I hope he recognises his reckless actions could so easily have been fatal.' Hudson never gave an explanation for the incident or give any indication as to why he had attacked his friend at the wedding of his sister Chantelle and Brett Gregson. At Preston Crown Court, Lancashire, self-employed plasterer Hudson, of Kirkham, was found guilty of wounding after a trial. The incident took place in May last year at a £500,000 farmhouse owned by the bridegroom's parents in the rural village of Wrea Green. A marquee had been erected at the farm for the guests attending the event following the wedding of Hudson's unnamed sister. The court heard Hudson went after Mr Bennett with a glass and confronted the victim before smashing it against his neck. Prosecutor Mr Richard Haworth said: 'The complainant wishes he could understand why it took place and hopes the defendant is remorseful and regrets what he has done. 'He recounts how he lies in bed at night and relives matters and thinks about the consequences. He expresses his gratitude to the surgeons at the Royal Preston Hospital to remove the shards of glass still in the very vulnerable area of the neck. Random attack: The court heard how Hudson (pictured) went after Mr Bennett with a glass and confronted the victim before smashing it against his neck . 'He describes having problems sleeping, taking prescription sleeping tablets and describes how he awakes often in distress. His self confidence had hit rock bottom and feels very self conscious as to the scar on his neck. He feels on edge when he is out and aware of stares and finger pointing. 'He is paranoid that everyone is looking at him and does from time to time wear clothing to hide it, scarves to avoid people asking questions. He doesn't want to go out at all.' He added that Mr Bennett attends therapy and may need plastic surgery in the future for the 'raised and angry scarring'. He added: 'The impact upon his social life, he avoids get togethers and family meals and hates being the centre of attention. he is embarrassed and vulnerable to questions put to him about how he is.' Mr Haworth added that he had been an avid Manchester City fan and had held a season ticket for many years travelling to home, away and even abroad games. However since the attack he is no longer confident enough to go. Left lasting scars: Since Hudson (pictured) attacked Mark Bennett, the victim has suffered paranoia and has struggled to sleep. He may also need plastic surgery . Mr Haworth added that it was 'a huge change to what his social life used to be' and that his circle of friends has reduced. Mr Bennett also suffered at work and found it difficult dealing with customers, feeling self-conscious and said his business had suffered. Hudson had two convictions in the last six years for battery and disorderly behaviour and nine years ago he was given a caution for assault occasioning actual body harm. His counsel Iain Simkin said the single but 'damaging' blow had occurred whilst he was drunk. He added: 'He does present as a docile character whilst in drink he behaves in a wholly different way. 'There is genuine remorse even though there was a trial, particularly as he considers the victim was a friend. 'His judgement was skewed by drink. He has the support of a loving family, they understand what is going to happen to him and understand he is going to prison for what he has done.' Passing sentence Judge Stuart Baker told Hudson: 'You now realise the enormity of what you did and realise how close Mr Bennett came to possibly losing his life' Passing sentence Judge Stuart Baker told Hudson. 'You now realise the enormity of what you did and realise how close Mr Bennett came to possibly losing his life. 'Quite why you behaved in the way you did, no one is likely to know. Others who speak well of you are at a loss as to why you behaved the way you did. 'Your conduct is not excused by being in drink. Committing an offence whilst fuelled by alcohol is aggravating to the offence, it is not an excuse. 'You committed the offence when Mr Bennett was leaving the premises where the party had taken place. 'He was beyond the gateway, he was on the road walking away from the property when you attacked him when you had a glass in your hand. It may have been that when you left you did not have in your mind attacking him with the glass. 'You went after him, when you did confront him for reasons known only to yourself you struck him with the glass to the side of the neck that caused not only life threatening injuries but very unsightly scarring he will have to live with for the rest of his life long after you have served your prison sentence. 'The effect on his has been quite substantial. He realises how close he came to losing his life. He is troubled at night. Hudson was sentenced to three and a half years at Preston Crown Court, above, today . 'He can't fully understand why it happened. His confidence is at a very low ebb, understandably he is very self conscious. I have no reason to doubt it has had a significant impact upon his social life. 'You used a glass as a weapon, thankfully it was not a weapon which was already smashed but even in its state it was still a weapon.' He added that he must also bear in mind Hudson's previous convictions. 'You have resorted to violence rather than walking away from violence. This incident occurred at what should have been an extremely happy event. 'Many people were present, they would have been understandably shocked by what they saw when Mr Bennett returned in his injured state. 'All those who saw Mr Bennett would have been greatly shocked by the scene.'","Matthew Hudson attacked friend without warning at sister's wedding party .

"A mother jailed for allowing her children to ‘pick and choose’ when they went to school because she thought they would learn ‘more on a beach than in a hot stuffy classroom’ now admits she was wrong. Claudia Ward, 42, said prison was the wake-up call she needed and that her children all now had 100 per cent attendance records. Miss Ward said she initially wanted her six children to have ‘an amount of choice themselves’. She admitted that if her two older children were up late and ‘didn’t fancy’ going to school she would let them stay off. Scroll down for video . Admits her fault: Claudia Ward (centre), pictured with her children Riley (left), six, and Nia (right), nine, had argued that her children would gain more from a ‘free-thinking’ day on the beach or a woodland walk . On other occasions she said she had ‘just wanted some company’. But their schools and her local education authority disagreed with her flexible approach and she was prosecuted five times before being jailed for five months. Miss Ward admitted: ‘When I spent my first night in the cell, the enormity of what I had done hit home. 'I felt so guilty; my stubbornness had meant I was on a prison wing in Gloucester, miles away from my young and vulnerable children. Great outdoors: Miss Ward let her children play truant because she thought they would learn more on day trips. Pictured above are two of her six children - Riley (left) and Nia (right) ‘I accepted that my views on education were not correct and everyone must adhere to the same rules, or there would be anarchy. It was the wake-up call I needed.’ Miss Ward, who is single, has six children: Jack, 24, Amos, 21, Rudy 17, Annie, 16, Nia, nine, and Riley, six. They have four different fathers. She was prosecuted in 2008 and then again in 2011 and 2012. But the court heard her children’s ‘attendance issues’ dated back to 2002. ‘If it was a sunny day and I thought one of my children would have been bored and sat staring out the window of the classroom wishing they were at the beach – I could not see the merit of them not being on the beach looking at rock pools,’ said Miss Ward, a freelance creative writer from Falmouth, Cornwall. ‘I thought they would gain far more from that. I thought they would be far better actually there experiencing it rather than sat in a stuffy classroom. Riley and Nia: The children were looked after by other family members while Miss Ward was in prison . ‘My ideas for education were always more outside the box and free-thinking,’ she added. ‘I was all about the children having an amount of choice themselves. 'This didn’t tally well with the national curriculum. It got to the point where there was no room for dialogue with the school and it was conflict all the way.’ Reflected in her cell: Miss Ward was jailed for five months in 2013 at Truro Magistrates’ Court . During the 2012 court hearing – which Miss Ward failed to attend – magistrates were told that three of the children’s education was suffering through their absences and one had missed a GCSE exam. Liz Mozeley, education welfare officer, told Truro Magistrates’ Court: ‘She felt they could pick and choose when they go.’ On that occasion, after a warrant was issued for her arrest, she was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for 24 months. But the truanting continued and she was jailed for 20 weeks in February 2013. Cornwall Council said it has been working with her for a decade at a cost of about £15,000 and prosecution was a ‘last resort’. Education welfare officer John Heath told the court: ‘Claudia is a capable woman but has a very odd outlook as far as education is concerned.’ The court heard that three of the children; Annie, Nia and Riley, missed more than a third of sessions between September and December 2012 – equalling 73 whole days. Miss Ward served ten weeks of her 20-week jail term. She was released in April 2013. Her children were looked after by other family members. She said: ‘I was shocked and did not for one second did I think they would give me a five-month sentence.’ She said she used her time inside to re-evaluate her principles.","Claudia Ward said her children would gain more from 'free-thinking' day .

"Jailed: Vicky Marks stole £4,200 from vulnerable Joan Groucher while pretending to care for her . A carer stole thousands of pounds from the 90-year-old dementia victim she was supposed to be looking after finding her PIN written in her diary. Vicky Marks left her frail victim Joan Groucher 'heartbroken' by abusing her trust to plunder £4,200 from her bank account over a seven-month period. The victim was so upset by the crime that she has had to leave her home in Croydon, south London and move into sheltered accommodation. Marks, 59, visited Mrs Groucher twice a week and stole her bank card so she could withdraw large amounts of cash, using the code written in the elderly woman's diary. She even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital, Croydon Crown Court heard. Sentencing Marks to 12 months in jail, Recorder Silas Reid told her: 'The victim was in her nineties, had problems with dementia, and, effectively, you inveigled your way into her family.' He added: 'It's still unclear to me why you would do that to someone of that age, why you would cause her that much pain, which, in the end, wasn't really for that much money. 'But time and time again you took her card and took money from her account. It seems almost every time you went to her house you would have taken money.' Mrs Groucher, who has four children and eight grand-children, had lived at the same house for around 30 years, but she was so distressed by the crime that her dementia deteriorated and she had to move into care. 'One of the features of this case which is disturbing is that she had to leave her home,' Mr Reid said. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Groucher said: 'I know Vicky does not have a mother, but that is no reason to do what she did. 'You were trusted by me and I'm heartbroken. It's disgusting what Vicky did to me. It worries me she could have done it to other people.' Paul Fairley, prosecuting, told the court that Mrs Groucher paid Marks £10 every time she visited. The thief's deception was found out when Mrs Groucher's daughter Caroline Baldwin, 70, saw that there was money missing from her bank account in July last year. Hearing: Croydon Crown Court (above) heard Marks even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital . 'She noticed there was £2,000, or £3,000 less than what there should have been,' Mr Fairley said. Mrs Baldwin then took a closer look at her mother's bank statement and noticed 'a pattern of sums of £100 and £200 withdrawn over a significant period of time', he added. She notified the police who checked CCTV footage from the Lloyd's Bank branch in Croydon and identified Marks withdrawing £100 from the victim's account the previous day. Marks, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was arrested and pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing. Speaking outside court today, Mrs Baldwin said her family was 'elated' by the jail sentence, but added: 'It's had a detrimental effect on mum - she has deteriorated badly. 'Part of that is due to her age, but every time I see her she mentions it and says, ""Why did she take it?"" and ""How could she do that?"" 'When I told her about the sentence it was the first time I have seen her smile for a long time.' Mrs Baldwin said she was 'disgusted' by Marks, whom her family had known for around five years, saying: 'If she had been handed a suspended sentence she would have done it again tomorrow. 'I think she has gotten away with it up until now, but we weren't going to let her get away with it.'","Vicky Marks, 59, was supposed to be caring for 90-year-old Joan Groucher .

"This incredible photograph from war-torn Syria shows a remarkable bus barricade built to protect civilians from government forces' sniper fire. Three single-decker buses can be seen turned upright to form a wall in the middle of a street in Aleppo, as a lone child walks past the makeshift barrier. The city has been ravaged by the country's civil war, with forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad controlling much of the north of the settlement while the rebels occupy the south. Scroll down for videos . Bus barricade: Three single-decker buses can be seen turned upright to form a wall in the middle of a street in Aleppo, as a lone child walks past the makeshift barrier . Diplomacy remains stalled between the two sides, with rounds of peace talks between the Assad government and the opposition coming to nothing - including a proposed local ceasefire in Aleppo, the largest city in Syria. An estimated 31,000 people are said to have died in the city, however this number could be far higher, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says at least 215,518 people had been killed throughout Syria since the uprising began four years ago. Aleppo has only 90 minutes of electricity a day and conditions are of 'grave concern', the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Last week the Red Cross evacuated 17 disabled people across frontlines in Aleppo for treatment, as well as restoring a hospital generator. There are fresh hopes that fighting could soon cease, at least temporarily, after US Secretary of State John Kerry said the time had come to 'negotiate' with Assad. Despite earlier insisting the the iron-fisted leader's days were numbered, Kerry said: 'Well, we have to negotiate in the end. We've always been willing to negotiate.' Destruction: Syrian civilians search for survivors in the rubble of a building knocked down by a bomb fired by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad . Rescuers hack through the rubble as they try to find any survivors following a strike by Syrian government forces, who continue to pound Aleppo with bombs . Kerry acknowledged that it would need increased pressure on Assad, 'to make it clear to him that there is a determination by everybody to seek that political outcome and change his calculation about negotiating'. 'That's underway right now. And I am convinced that, with the efforts of our allies and others, there will be increased pressure on Assad.' The conflict began as an anti-government uprising, with protesters taking to the streets on March 15, 2011, inspired by similar revolts in Egypt and Tunisia. But a fierce government crackdown on the demonstrations prompted a militarisation of the uprising and its descent into today's brutal conflict. The UN refugee agency UNHCR says Syria is now 'the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era', with around four million people fleeing abroad. Fight back: The rebels (pictured) control swathes of the south of the city with the help of their own firepower, but pockets of opposition-held territory in the north could soon be captured by the Syrian army . Attack: The rebels (pictured) fire on the Syrian army as the battle for Aleppo continues, four years after the civil war started during the Arab Spring . An estimated 31,000 people are said to have died in Aleppo (pictured), however this number could be far higher as tens of thousands more are missing . More than a million are taking refuge in neighbouring Lebanon, while others are sheltering in Jordan and Turkey - placing a huge strain on those countries. Inside Syria, more than seven million people have been displaced, and the United Nations says around 60 percent of the population now lives in poverty. The country's infrastructure has been decimated, and experts say the economy has been set back by some 30 years. Despite international outrage at the death toll, and allegations that his regime used chemical weapons against its own people in August 2013, Assad has clung to power and does not look likely to be deposed any time soon. His forces have consolidated their grip on the capital Damascus, where 18 more people were killed and more than 100 were injured in air raids yesterday.","Syrian civilians turn three buses upright to form a wall in the middle of a street to protect them from sniper fire .

"Two teenagers convicted of sexually assaulting an elderly woman and then pouring bleach down her throat after breaking into her Southern California home have been sentenced to 30 years in prison. The 87-year-old woman, named as Jane Doe, told Raymond Miranda, 15, and Ruben Melanson, 16, in court on Friday that they terrorized her, as they were sentenced as adults for the crime that occurred last April. The boys will remain in custody of the California Department of Juvenile Justice until they turn 18 and then will be transferred to a state prison. They will remain registered as sex offenders for life. Scroll down for video .

The 87-year-old woman told Raymond Miranda (above), 15, and Ruben Melanson, 16, in court on Friday that they terrorized her as they were sentenced as adults for the crime that occurred last April . The boys (both Miranda and Melanson pictured during court on Friday) will remain in custody of the California Department of Juvenile Justice until they turn 18 years old before being transferred to a state prison . The teenagers pleaded guilty to several charges including robbery last year after forcing their way into the apartment of Doe, a resident at the gated Camelot Retirement Community in Hemet. Miranda and Melanson, who were aged 14 and 15 at the time of the incident, also admitted to rape, elderly abuse and a gang enhancement during the April 17, 2014 attack, according to the Los Angeles Times. Prosecutor Sean Crandell from the Riverside District Attorney's Office said it was one of the worst cases he has worked on during his 17-year career. Both boys were charged with burglary, elder abuse with great bodily injury, sexual penetration with a foreign object by force and rape, according to the Press Enterprise. The teenagers reportedly crawled through a window of the woman's home while she was asleep, tied her up, sexually assaulted and beat her using knives and bottles, and poured two bottles of bleach over her body and down her throat, according to prosecutors. During the sentencing, Doe (above) brought Judge Judith Clark to tears as she told the boys that they did evil things and took away her independence, but said she appreciated Miranda's apology .

Nearly unable to breathe, she pulled a cord that alerted the Camelot complex manager who called authorities for help. Doe had completely stopped breathing by the time responding officers arrived but was revived through CPR. The victim was placed in a medically-induced coma following the crime and now has to use a wheelchair and oxygen tank to help her breathe. Miranda apologized to her for his actions as he cried in court, according to CBS. He said: 'I'm sorry for going into your house. I don't expect you to forgive me. But I apologize for going to your house. I'm sorry. I truly am. I don't expect you to forgive me.'

Doe said: 'Now for the boys, I want them to look at me. I appreciate your apology. 'I want you to look at me and remember me because when you broke into my apartment in April, you terrorized me and also you took away my independence. You did evil things.' Judge Clark said that she admired Doe for having experienced what she did but still having the courage to come and speak before the court. Authorities do not usually identify juvenile suspects in criminal cases, however Hemet officials said they named Raymond  Miranda to protect the public, and aid in the capture of Melanson who was at large following the attack in April, according to CBS. Melanson was eventually taken into custody after being found at a hotel room at the Pechanga Resort and Casino. Both boys will have to register as sex offenders for life, and it is likely that they will not be released until they are 50 years old.","Raymond Miranda, 15, and Ruben Melanson, 16, committed gruesome attack last April in California .

"Over 70 schoolchildren were left screaming in terror after the top deck of the bus they were travelling in was completely sliced off when it slammed into a low  bridge. The youngsters, who were on a school trip to the Thorpe Park amusement park, were forced to duck for cover as the vehicle hit the railway bridge in Staines, Surrey, shortly after 10.20am.

'They obviously managed to duck at the right time. It is quite a miracle that they did not suffer any major head injuries. 'One of the youngsters had glass in his head and a few had minor cuts. Two or three have been taken to hospital as a precaution. 'Thankfully there were no serious injuries but they are very shaken.' South East Coast Ambulance Service declared it as a 'major incident' after the call came in at 10.16am, with a number of ambulances from Surrey and London sent to Chertsey Lane, which is expected to be shut for hours. A total of 58 walking wounded were reported, and 10 people were assessed at the scene. Three were taken to St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey to be treated. Ambulance spokesman Justin Wand said: 'We have robust plans in place for managing incidents of this nature and will be working with our emergency service partners to ensure that we assess and treat anyone who may be injured as swiftly as possible.' The vehicle was operated by Galleon Travel. A spokesman said: 'They left school at 8.30am and we know that the bus struck a bridge at the entrance to Thorpe Park. 'Emergency services were at the scene shortly afterwards. As far as we are concerned there weren't any serious injuries to the passengers inside the vehicle. 'The company were in the process of arranging to take the passengers back to school, I do not think they have gone back to Thorpe Park.' The schoolchildren were on a trip to the Thorpe Park amusement park in Surrey as a reward for good work . A spokesman for Surrey Police said: 'Officers are working closely with the South East Coast Ambulance Service and Surrey Fire and Rescue Service at the scene. 'Police have closed Chertsey Lane at the junction with Riverside Drive and at the Chertsey Lane roundabout while the emergency services deal with the incident. 'The road is expected to remain closed for a significant period and motorists are being advised to avoid the area if possible. '","Youngsters forced to duck for cover as bus slammed into the bridge .

"She was once the largest ocean liner in the world and her sinking caused shockwaves across the globe when 1,198 passengers and crew lost their lives after a U-boat attack. Now a newly discovered image suggests previous claims that the name of RMS Lusitania was painted out to protect her on her fateful final voyage in 1915 were untrue, making her a legitimate target for German submarines. Officials at the time had said everything had been done to try and protect the British boat - including painting out its name - meaning that enemy vessels would have struggled to work out if she was a civilian ship, or an armed merchant cruiser as the Lusitania was. This picture, which has only just emerged, is believed to be the last one ever taken of the RMS Lusitania in New York - and it clearly shows her name had not been painted over as authorities had said . The RMS Lusitania (pictured) was sunk by a German U-Boat in 1915 killing 1,198 passengers and crew . Kent Layton, 35, from New York, said: 'It was said they had done everything to make her less 'findable' to the enemy, camouflaging her for protection, helping protect her from attack. 'It was stated that the ship's name was obscured at the same time, in an attempt to conceal her identity. The photo in question helps to clear up a long standing myth.' The Lusitania was torpedoed by a German U-Boat in 1915, 11 miles off the southern coast of Ireland and inside the declared 'zone of war'. A second internal explosion sent her down in just 18 minutes. Much like the Titanic, the Lusitania did no carry enough lifeboats for all the passengers, officers and crew, and was actually carrying four lifeboats fewer than the Titanic carried in 1912. This was common practice for large passenger ships at the time, as it was believed that in busy shipping lanes help would never be far away. However, due to the lack of life boats nearly 1,200 people lost their lives, making it one of the greatest maritime tragedies of all time. One of the new pictures to emerge of passengers onboard the RMS Lusitania before its sinking . The ship was attacked off the coast of Ireland after leaving New York for Liverpool in May 1915 . She was launched by the Cunard Line in 1906, alongside her sister ship, the Mauretania. It was the incident that helped convince the Americans to enter the First World War. The sinking caused a storm of protest in the United States as 128 Americans were among the dead. President Woodrow Wilson said 'America is too proud to fight' and demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. The ship's sinking provided Britain with a propaganda opportunity and turned public opinion in many countries against Germany. This helped shift public opinion in the US against Germany and influenced America's eventual declaration of war two years later in 1917. The RMS Lusitania became an iconic symbol in military recruiting campaigns of why the war was being fought. In January 1917 Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare. After submarines sank a further seven US merchant ships Wilson finally went to Congress on April 6, 1917, calling for a declaration of war on Germany . The Lusitania and the Mauretania were launched at a time of fierce competition for the North Atlantic trade. The German shipping lines were aggressive competitors in the transatlantic trade, and the Lusitania and the Mauretania were built to outperform their German counterparts. They were fitted with then-revolutionary turbine engines, enabling them to maintain a service speed of 25 knots. They were also equipped with lifts, wireless telegraph, electric lights and provided 50 per cent more passenger space than any other ship. Lusitania was subsidised by the British government, in the hope that she could be converted into a military vessel if needed. A secret compartment was designed for the purpose of carrying arms and ammunition, and when war was declared the Lusitania was requisitioned by the British Admiralty. She began her new role as an armed merchant cruiser, and was put on the official list of AMCs. The Declaration of Paris codified the rules for naval engagements involving civilian vessels. The Cruiser Rules required that the crew and passengers of civilian ships be safeguarded in the event that the ship is to be confiscated or sunk. Popular myth says that to protect the Lusitania, her name was painted over - so that she could not be identified as a military vessel. One of the new pictures to emerge of passengers onboard the RMS Lusitania before its sinking . A survivor of the sinking pictured after being brought back to shore - 1,198 passengers and crew died . The Cruiser Rules mean that she could have been searched, but thanks to her secret compartment her military cargo would have remained undetected. The ship was designed by Leonard Peskett and built by John Brown and Compan in Clydebank, Scotland. She was launched by the Cunard Line in 1906. The ship was 787ft long and featured nine passenger decks. She was kitted out with 25 Scotch boilers and four direct-acting Parsons steam turbines producing 76,000 hp. The ship also boasted four triple blade propellers. Lusitania was fitted with revolutionary new turbine engines and was able to maintain a service speed of 25 knots. She was equipped with lifts, wireless telegraph and electric light. The ship provided 50 per cent more passenger space than any other boat. She held 552 passengers in first class, 460 in second, 1,186 in third class, alongside 850 crew members and 7,000 tons of coal. However, this new evidence shows that immediately before her final journey from New York to Liverpool she was still showing her livery, and Lusitania is clearly visible. With a life-long interest in ocean liners, Mr Layton has a vast knowledge of the subject and has spent a lifetime reading about ships such as the Titanic and the Lusitania. He decided to write a book about the Lusitania, to debunk all the myths that lie around its history, and to illustrate the book he collected photos from other fans of the subject. One of the photo contributors sent Kent an image that came from a collection he had purchased, clearly showing the name 'Lusitania' printed on the side of the boat as it prepares to make its final journey. Kent said: 'My main focus is in trying to sort through a veritable minefield of idiotic conspiracy theories-such as deliberately setting up the ship to be sunk in order to bring the US into the war, the bizarre theories of high explosive cargo causing the second blast. 'About 10 years ago I realized that the history of the Lusitania's early career, which was eminently successful over the course of about seven and a half years, had gone largely unexplored. 'Most authors simply wrote that the ship was big and fast, entered service in 1907, and then the war started. 'This was something that truly needed to be researched and told, and this book followed a lot of leg work in pinning down some of that history's highlights. The Lusitania was subsidised by the government so she could be converted into a military vessel if needed . 'The Lusitania, in particular, has been the victim of a great deal of bad information and even conspiracy theories over the years. 'As far as this particular image, it's currently held in the collection of Lusitania historian Mike Poirier. 'Mike purchased the album some time back, and I think over the years the original information was sadly lost. 'The photograph shows that the ship's name was not painted out. They weren't trying to conceal her identity, as has been claimed. 'Lusitania - An Illustrated Biography',book is published by Amberley Publishing . Captain Raimund Weisbach  was the torpedo officer on the German U-boat, the U20, who saw to the preparation and firing of the torpedo that sank the RMS Lusitania on May 7 1915 .

"A soldier has revealed how he left behind Ugly Betty and came home to Cinderella after seeing his wife's dramatic weight loss. Tracey Desmond, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, wanted to surprise her husband Jason when he returned from a tour of the Falkland Islands this month. The 35-year-old dropped three stone in just two months - going from a size 22 to a svelte size 12/14 and kept her impressive 38lb weight loss a secret from her partner of four years. Tracey Desmond, 35, surprised her husband of four years, Jason, by shedding almost three stone in two months while he was away on tour . Husband Jason compared his wife's look to TV character Ugly Betty (right) before her weight loss (left) Tracey said she was determined to beat the bulge before Jason - a Corporal in the Royal Logistics Corp - returned home and lose the weight with hypnosis. She said she was so committed to keeping her changing figure under wraps she would even make sure Jason couldn't see her when the pair would video chat while Jay was serving abroad with the army. She said: 'I decided after Christmas that I needed to do something - it was getting ridiculous. The weight just seemed to creep up on me and I couldn't believe that I was a size 20. 'I wanted to keep the whole surprise factor and do a big reveal so I would make sure Jay couldn't see me when we Skyped. 'I was just googling weight loss and Easy Loss came up - I had heard of people doing hypnosis to stop smoking so I thought I would give it a go. 'I started at the beginning of January and the weight just seemed to drop off - I've lost 38 pounds in just two months. 'I even went out and bought a new dress, in a size 12, and got dressed up for the occasion. 'And when Jay walked through the door and saw me there was this look of shock on his face.' Jason, 42, said: 'It was a massive shock - I felt like I had left behind Ugly Betty and came home to Cinderella. Before the weight loss: Tracey had started to pile on the pounds after she became seriously ill with polycystic ovaries and comfort-ate to get over having to undergo a full hysterectomy . 'Nothing Tracey has tried before has ever really worked so I was shocked that this worked so well. And it was lovely to see her in a dress for a change. 'I have had to learn to feed myself too as she only eats when she's hungry - so it has probably done me some good too. 'When I get back from tour I have promised her I am going to take her shopping and treat her to some new clothes for our holiday.' The HR and Training Coordinator can now fit her whole body in one leg of her former size 22 trousers . Tracey started to pile on the pounds after she became seriously ill with polycystic ovaries and comfort ate to get over having to undergo a full hysterectomy. But the determined HR and Training Coordinator has now set herself the task of shedding the final two stone by the time Jay's tour comes to an end in 10 weeks time. And she is spurred on by a luxury holiday the pair have booked to the Dominican Republic - with her final goal being to flaunt her new bikini body in a size 12 tankini. The ultimate goal is for Tracey to wear a size 12 tankini on the beach on holiday in the Dominican Republic . Tracey said: 'We always book a holiday for when Jason is off so that we have something to look forward to. 'My goal now is to be able to wear a tankini on the beach - that's what I am pushing towards. And I don't want all the women looking at him while we are away. 'I feel such a huge difference in myself since I started Easy Loss and it is just so easy. It's not a diet and I can still eat whatever I want, whenever I want - but I just eat when I'm hungry. 'It's a way of life and I can't ever see myself going back to how I was before now. I have learned how to listen to my body, and only eat when I am hungry.' Tracey's incredible weight loss story received 900 likes on the hypnosis app's Facebook support group . Sue Peckham, co-founder of the Easy Loss Virtual Gastric Band - Lose Weight Fast App, said: 'Tracey is an absolute inspiration. She has been brilliant and followed the instructions of the app to the letter. She has really done so well. 'And it is such a lovely story that she did it to surprise her husband, it brought a tear to my eye when I spoke to them and he said that he was so shocked when he came home and saw her. They are such a sweet couple. 'Her story got an incredible 900 likes from our Easyloss Facebook Support Group members-one of the biggest responses we've ever had.'

"A report detailing allegations of instances of rape and sexual assault inside Australia's Nauru detention centre has been labelled as 'very concerning' by Finance Minister Mathias Cormann. The 86-page review, released on Friday, included allegations of indecent and physical assault, as well as sexual harassment, at the offshore processing centre. 'The department has accepted all of the recommendations and all of the recommendations will be implemented,' Mr Cormann told Sky News on Saturday. However, Labor have criticised the Federal Government over its initial response to the report after Tony Abbott said these institutions 'aren't perfect.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A review into sexual abuse inside Australia's Nauru detention centre (pictured) has found evidence of rape, sexual assault and guards trading marijuana for sexual favours from female detainees . The ABC  reported that when Mr Abbott was first asked about his response to the report he appeared to dismiss its findings by responding 'occasionally, I dare say, things happen.' Labor's Immigration spokesperson Richard Marles called the Federal Government's response a 'disgrace' and believes Mr Abbott needs to take responsibility for the situation. 'The Moss review finds that the testimony of asylum seekers is convincing and it concludes that the degree of sexual assault within these detention facilities is being under-reported,' Mr Marles said in Melbourne. 'This is quite evidently shocking.' Prime Minister Abbott later said that the Government would adopt the 19 recommendations outlined in the review and called the findings 'very disturbing.' The independent review by former integrity commissioner Philip Moss was released on Friday and has uncovered several dozen cases with guards possibly trading drugs for 'sexual favours' on the Pacific island nation . Work has already begun on implementing the recommendations in cooperation with the Nauru government, service providers and the Australian Federal Police. The report also allegedly found evidence that guards traded marijuana for sexual favours from female detainees. The independent review was ordered by former immigration minister, Scott Morrison following earlier claims that children had been abused while in detention. Detainees had previously complained that two-minute showers were not long enough and had requested four minute showers instead. However when one woman asked if she could turn the water back on to wash shampoo out of her eyes, it's alleged in the review that a male guard said he would give her more time, if she showed him her naked body. The review also alleged that there have been two specific instances of rape at the centre . The 86-page report detailed allegations of indecent and physical assault, as well as sexual harassment, at the offshore processing centre . Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says the content of a review into allegations of abuse against asylum seekers on Nauru is 'very concerning . Mr Cormann would not be drawn on whether more media access should be allowed on the island in the wake of the report, but said he was concerned by its findings . One rape happened in a woman's tent, it's alleged. The woman subsequently asked for the incident to be kept quiet for fear of retaliation from other detainees.  She then changed her mind and asked for police to investigate, according to the report. The Nauruan Government then granted refugee status to the alleged perpetrator and he is now settled in the Nuaruan community, the report stated. The second female detainee reported that she had been raped by a 'contract service provider staff member', according to the report. She also did not report the incident due to cultural and religious reasons. In another instance, a female detainee told the review that a guard had allegedly offered to give her friend chewing gum and a lollipop if she allowed him to see her naked. On another occasion two female detainees recounted a time when a driver and his assistant turned the vehicle's headlights off and propositioned the women with an offer of cigarettes and chewing gum. One transferee told the review that women in the camp could offer sexual favours in return for marijuana. 'Because they (the transferees) are suffering great depression here, and they feel relieved when they smoke the marijuana, the officers have made them addicted for their own reasons,' the detainee said. 'Because the women do not get paid here, so what they need to obtain,they only have to offer sexual - fulfil the requests of the men.'","A new report has found evidence of abuse at Nauru detention centre .

"Britain's courts are ‘seriously weakening’ the fight against terrorism by ‘trotting along’ with politically correct rulings from European judges, a new study claims. UK judges are on an ‘expansionist binge’ which has led them to implementing human rights laws made in Strasbourg on crucial national security issues including deporting terror suspects and control orders. By applying and interpreting Euro legislation, the unelected judiciary is ‘meddling’ in policy decisions made by Parliament which amounts to a ‘denial of democracy’, according to a report by the influential Civitas think-tank. It calls for a shake-up of the Human Rights Act to prevent further ‘power grabs’ by the British courts encroaching into areas that should be left to the Government and MPs. Battle: Muslim cleric Abu Qatada, described as Al Qaeda’s spokesman in Britain, was finally returned home in 2013 after a 12-year legal battle which cost taxpayers millions . The report, published today FRI, blasts Britain’s left-leaning judiciary for being ‘too willing’ to apply rulings from the European Court of Human RIghts in the UK, rather than simply taking them into account. Barrister Michael Arnheim, who wrote the study The Problem With Human Rights Law, said the situation was hampering the Government’s ability to protect our borders by fighting terrorism and illegal immigration – putting innocent lives at risk. In one high-profile case, the Court of Appeal ruled in 2008 that deporting hate preacher Abu Qatada would breach his human rights, because evidence to be used against him on trial in Jordan may have been obtained through torture. The firebrand Muslim cleric, described as Al Qaeda’s spokesman in Britain and who spouted bile on the streets on London, was finally returned home in 2013 after a 12-year legal battle which cost taxpayers millions of pounds. Meanwhile, British judges have been blasted for weakening now-defunct control orders and the replacement Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (Tpims) which were introduced to impose rigid restrictions on terror suspects who could not be prosecuted or deported. It fuelled concern that the judiciary was chiselling away at measures to protect the UK from jihadists. 'Too willing': British judges have been accused of being too willing to apply rulings from EU courts in the UK, rather than taking them into account . There has also been outrage over cases in which criminals have avoided deportation by pleading that their removal would breach the family life clause of the European Convention on Human Rights. Among them was Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, a failed asylum seeker who ran down and killed 12-year-old Amy Houston - and fled the scene - while disqualified from driving. A judge subsequently allowed him to remain here because he had two children with a British woman. In his report, Mr Arnheim said: ‘The domestic courts are on an expansionist binge, which has never been checked by the government or parliament. ‘Continued failure to check this development will result not only in a serious weakening of national defences against terrorism and illegal immigration, but will also amount to a denial of democracy. ‘National security and the public interest actually refer to the human rights of thousands or even millions of individuals. ‘Preventing the government from detaining or deporting potentially dangerous individuals may result in the violation of the individual rights to liberty or even to life of thousands of law-abiding citizens.’ The report says that UK domestic courts tend to ‘trot along’ rulings made by the European Court of Human Rights because it is ‘politically correct’. ‘More and more English judges are now starting to pooh-pooh the age-old British constitutional principle of the sovereignty of parliament and the rule that legislation and policy decisions are no-go areas for the courts,’ Mr Arnheim wrote. But he also criticised successive ‘supine’ governments for ‘lacking the courage’ to stand up to the judiciary. Demanding reform rather than the scrapping of the Human Rights Act, he said it was imperative that ‘clear limits’ are imposed on the ability of judges to interpret and extend the scope of European human rights laws. At last year’s Tory party conference, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has gone further by pledging to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights if the Conservatives win the election. Under explosive plans to seize back sovereignty over human rights from Europe, this would ignore verdicts by Euro judges it does not agree with in a bid to reinstate the primacy of Parliament. He said if Strasbourg objected, the UK would resign from the European Court of Human Rights and ‘walk away’","Think tank says meddling in Parliamentary policy is denial of democracy .

"Two teenage boys have been caught on film performing a dangerous stunt on a speeding commuter train in New Zealand. The boys, who risked their lives to hang off a train carriage in New Zealand, were spotted outside Manor Park Station, north of Wellington, on Sunday afternoon. Footage of the pair’s brazen stunt was posted on Instagram and is now circulating on the internet. Police and rail authorities have condemned the reckless behaviour. Scroll down for video . At speeds of over 90kmh the unidentified teenage boys could have easily fallen to their death during the crazy stunt . Police shift commander John Spence said police were astounded by ‘the crazy stunt’ that could have easily killed the boys. ""Falling off a train travelling at 90kmh would have led to serious if not fatal injuries,"" he told NZ media. The pair abandoned their joy ride before the train reached the next station. KiwiRail zero harm manager, Aaron Temperton, said the train could have been travelling at up to 90kmh, a very dangerous speed when people are outside the carriage. Wellington Metro trains can reach speeds of 110kmh. ""It is hugely irresponsible. People can die and have died from things such as this. We cannot understand why they would put themselves in harm's way,"" Mr Temperton told NZ media outlets. Shocking: Police and rail authorities are shocked by the crazy stunt which was caught on film . He said anyone participating in behaviour like this could be prosecuted for trespassing and slapped with a massive fine. KiwiRail Metro manager, David Shepard, reminded everyone that actions like this can have consequences for a number of people, including staff and other commuters. ""Trespassing on the rail corridor is a huge problem and people who do this, whether it's being on the rail corridor or riding on the back of a train, run the risk of not only killing themselves but also traumatising the people who then have to deal with the consequences of their actions,"" he said to NZ reporters. Not cool: Rail authorities say other commuters and staff could have been traumatised if the stunt went wrong . The video footage was captured by Alexey Zhavoronkov while he was with his family on the road between Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt. He slammed the pairs behaviour wanting to set a good example for his son who also witness the act. ""We're originally from Russia and this kind of madness is more like normal there ... it was a shock to see people here doing it. It's really dangerous ... it was scary,"" he told NZ reporters. The footage has been handed to police and they are searching for the unidentified teens. Last year the number of reported incidents of trespassing on the rail corridor rose from 288 incidents in 2013 to 418. The stunt constitutes trespassing the perpetrators could be slapped with a hefty fine and criminal conviction .","Two boys have been caught on film dangling from rear of a train carriage .

"A young father who strangled his two sons and then sent a picture of a dead body to their mother will not face execution. Gabriel Armandariz, 32, of Graham, Texas was sentenced  to life in prison without parole on Thursday at Young County Court. Armandariz killed his two sons, Gatlin, two, and Luke, who was just eight-months-old in April 2011 before sending  a string of chilling text messages to their mother, Lauren Smith. One of the messages included a graphic image that appeared to show Luke dead, dangling from the closet held by cloth attached to his neck. While he will not be put to death, defense attorneys insist he will have a miserable life in prison. Scroll down for video . Gabriel Armandariz, 32, of Graham, Texas was sentenced on Thursday to life in prison without parole in the capital murder case (above Armandariz pictured in court on March 12 during his sentencing at the Young County Courthouse in Graham, Texas) Prosecutor Lisa Tanners said the state had to allow the citizens to decide if Armandariz should pay with his life or not (above Armandariz as Young County Judge Stephen Bristow read the jury's decision) He was convicted of the murders on February 27 which was followed by four weeks of testimony that the court heard before deciding his fate. However, the jury decided to spare him his life after stating there were mitigating circumstances to not execute him . Armandariz strangled his two sons, Gatlin (right), two, and Luke (left), eight months, in April 2011. Police found their bodies hidden in a crawl space underneath his home . Armandariz was convicted of the murders on February 27 which was followed by four weeks of testimony that the court heard before deciding his fate, according to the Graham Leader. The jury decided to spare him his life after stating there were mitigating circumstances to not execute him. The father was deemed too dangerous to society to live by prosecutors from the attorney general's office, according to the Star-Telegram. Earlier in the trial, prosecutor Tom Cloudt said: 'Gabriel is a lying, manipulating baby killer, and the evidence has shown this. 'Luke is dead, and Gabriel is trying to get a beer. Gabriel is not concerned.' Armandariz was cited as too dangerous to society to live by prosecutors from the Texas attorney general's office including, Tom Cloudt, who said the father is not phased by the killings . The father sent a string of chilling text messages to the children's mother, Lauren Smith, which included a graphic image that appeared to show Luke dead, dangling from the closet held by cloth attached to his neck (above Armandariz, left, pictured with Smith, right and their two sons) Armandariz called police after killing the boys telling them he had done it because Smith had told him to before ending the two-minute call (above Armandariz pictured with his sons) Last month, the text messages Armandariz sent to Smith where he said he was planning to kill the boys were revealed in court. Armandariz said he was doing it because of her partying ways while possibly pretending to be his new girlfriend. In one of the messages Armandariz sent to his ex, just hours before the boys are believe to have died, he wrote: 'I commend the spirits of these two boys to the Lord. I would much rather be with them than to be out partying with friends.' This was quickly followed by another in which he wrote: 'Look, I’m trying to offer you another opportunity to see our children. But as usual you would much rather be with your friends.' According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, prosecutors in the case argued that Smith was not even aware the texts were coming from Armandariz, and actually believed they were coming from the woman he was dating at the time. This seems to be backed up by the her responses to these texts, as she wrote in one: 'If I were you I’d get the hell away from him. Looks can be deceiving.' On the day the boys died, Armandariz sent a photo to Smith that appeared to show Luke dead. This was followed by the final text, which also showed both boys alive and lying next to him, and read: 'We love u, goodbye.' The final message Armandariz sent Smith, which included an image of both boys alive and lying next to him, read: 'We love u, goodbye' In February, Lt. James Reeves (above) revealed that after seeing the picture of Luke hanging from the closet, police rushed to Armandariz's home hoping to save Gatlin. Following the sentencing on Thursday, Lt. Reeves said justice has been serviced and that reliving the case was 'tough on everybody' Armandariz will be transferred to the Texas Department of Corrections to serve his sentence (pictured above leaving court) Once she received the graphic image of her dead son, she called authorities, according to Everything Lubbock. However, Armandariz had already called police telling them he had killed the boys because Smith had told him to before ending the two-minute call. In the bizarre 911 call he told the operator; 'My girlfriend asked me to kill my babies. What was I supposed to do? My girlfriend told me to kill both of them. What was I supposed to do? I hate her, I hate her, I hate her so much. I’m so scared now.' In February, Lt. James Reeves revealed that after seeing the picture of Luke hanging from the closet, police rushed to Armandariz's home hoping to save Gatlin. 'We were operating on the belief that Luke was dead,' said Lt. Reeves. 'We didn’t know about the older son.' However, when officers arrived, they found he bodies inside a tarp found in a crawl space underneath the residence Armandariz shared with his relatives in Graham. Officers went to Armandriz's home after being alerted about the graphic message sent with image of Luke's dead body. When they arrived, they found both bodies inside a tarp found in a crawl space underneath the residence Armandariz shared with his relatives in Graham . 'We saw four little feet inside the tarp,' said Lt. Reeves. 'One of the feet had a shoe on it. It was a little camel tennis shoe and that’s how we knew. We never laid eyes on the bodies other than to see those feet.' Following the sentencing on Thursday, Lt. Reeves said justice has been serviced and that reliving the case was 'tough on everybody', according to Texomas Homepage. While defense lawyers are happy that Armandariz was allowed to live, he will have a 'very miserable life' in prison, said  attorney Terri Moore. 'We have never tried to excuse what Gabriel did,' said Moore. 'What he did was completely wrong and was a criminal act but he’s got life without any possibility of parole and that is a severe punishment. 'It is a harsh punishment. He will have a very miserable life.' Moore added that capital punishment is for the 'worst of the worst human being' and the crime Gabriel committed was horrible, but that he is 'not the worst of the worst human being'. Armandariz will be transferred to the Texas Department of Corrections to serve his sentence.","Gabriel Armandariz, 32, of Graham, Texas, was sentenced to life in prison without parole on Thursday .
He was convicted last month for strangling his two sons, Gatlin, two, and Luke, eight months, in April 2011 .
Hours before killing them he sent text messages to his ex and the mother of the boys, Lauren Smith, threatening to kill them .
He then sent her a photo of what appeared to be the youngest boy, Luke, dead and dangling from a closet ceiling with a cloth around his neck'
After receiving the photo of her son, Smith called police who found the boys dead and wrapped in a tarp in the crawl space under Armandariz's home .

"Do you have any idea how much sugar you're eating? It's probably a lot more than you think. As this shocking graphic reveals, millions of us are unwittingly eating everyday foods packed with sugar - and getting fatter in the process. While some culprits, such as Coca-Cola and ice cream are well known (and used here for comparison purposes), there are many other less obvious foods - such as pasta sauce, soup and so-called healthy granola - that are loaded with the white stuff. For example, a 500g jar of Dolmio bolognaise sauce contains more than six cubes of sugar - the same as a Mars bar. And Heinz tomato soup is on par with Bulmer's cider in the sweetness stakes, with five cubes. Scroll down for video . Danger: As this worrying graphic reveals, millions of us are unwittingly eating everyday foods packed with sugar - and getting fatter in the process . Even a ‘healthy' fruit such as a mango contains nine cubes. However the sugars in milk, vegetables and pieces of fruit (as opposed to fruit juice), including dried fruit, do not wreak as much havoc. So if you’re getting most of your sugar from these sources, you can eat up to 18 cubes daily. More and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic. It is the sheer quantity of sugar that we consume that creates the problem, says Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University. ‘Sugar calories slip down so easily and lead to weight gain.’ The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends no more than 10 per cent of a person's daily energy should come from free sugars - those that are added to processed foods and drinks, but also those found naturally in honey, syrups and fruit juices. That equates to around 50g or 10 cubes a day - easily reached with a bottle of fizzy drink. However, the UN agency advises that people aim for no more than five per cent - 25g or around six teaspoons - to achieve the biggest health benefits. Yet many of us are consuming way in excess of this. A report published by the The World Health Organisation earlier this month revealed the current average intake of free sugars in North and Central America is 95g a day (19 cubes) rising to 130g (26 cubes) a day in South America. Meanwhile in Western Europe the average is 101g (20 cubes). Hidden health threat: A 500g jar of Dolmio bolognaise sauce contains more than six cubes of sugar - the same as a Mars bar. Meanwhile Heinz tomato soup is on par with Bulmer's cider, with five cubes. With the global obesity crisis spiralling out of control, health experts are becoming increasingly vocal about the dangers of 'hidden sugar' in food. Graham MacGregor, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine at Barts and The London Hospital, says the food industry is adding more and more sugar to food, which consumers are largely unaware of, as it is mostly hidden. He said: 'Added sugar in our diet is a very recent phenomenon and only occurred when sugar, obtained from sugar cane, beet and corn, became very cheap to produce. 'It’s a completely unnecessary part of our calorie intake: it has no nutritional value, gives no feeling of fullness and is acknowledged to be a major factor in causing obesity and diabetes both in the UK and worldwide.' The two most common forms of unhealthy added sugars are table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup, a liquid sweetener made from maize. Both are added to countless foods, turning up in everything from fizzy drinks to chicken korma. Sugars in fruit juices and honeys are also the unhealthy ‘added’ type. ‘Added sugars are more likely to do harm as they aren’t safely bound in the structure of a food, as they are in fruit,’ says Sasha Watkins, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. ‘It means they are available to the body in higher concentrations.’ He added: 'While it may not be surprising that a can of Coca-Cola has a staggering seven cubes of sugar (35g), similar amounts can be found in the most unlikely of foods.' These include flavoured water, yogurts, canned soup, ready meals and even bread. Professor MacGregor also cautions against opting for low fat foods that are often full of sugar instead to give them flavour. 'You might opt for 0 per cent fat in your yoghurt, but what if it also comes with five teaspoons of sugar? A bowl of Frosties with semi-skimmed milk only has four.' As Tam Fry, from  the National Obesity Forum, says: 'Stripping out fat from processed foods makes them less appealing to our taste buds. 'The inevitable consequence is that manufacturers increase other ingredients, including sugar, to recreate taste and texture.' Research also shows the huge toll sugar can take on our health. Though we all need some sugar - it is the essential fuel that powers all cells in our body - excess levels have been linked with raised levels of the hormone insulin, which increases the risk of diabetes. Furthermore, the body turns excess sugar into fat, which is stored around the major organs, placing us at risk of liver and heart disease. There are also fears that high sugar diets may promote some cancers. The theory is that glucose, one of the main ingredients in added sugar, creates repeated spikes of insulin. Even a ‘healthy' fruit such as a mango contains nine cubes, while a Muller Light strawberry yogurt has 2.5 . For reasons that are not clear, many tumours seem to have insulin receptors, hence a rise in this hormone fuels their growth. A large population study in the US showed that people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease. That was compared with those people who consumed less than 10 per cent of their calories each day through sugar, independent of other risk factors including weight. Professor MacGregor believes the sugar in our diets should now be gradually reduced, just as salt has been over the past few years. 'Salt content in food products in the supermarkets have now been reduced by 20-40 per cent and as a result, salt intake has fallen in the UK by 15 per cent (between 2001-2011), the lowest known figure of any developed country.' 'Like salt, most of the sugar we consume is hidden in processed food and soft drinks. 'There are also specific taste receptors for sugar, which if sugar intake is gradually reduced, become more sensitive. So over time we don’t notice that sugar levels have gone down.'","Millions of us are unwittingly eating everyday foods packed with sugar .

"The newest weapon in the breakfast fast-food wars is a buttermilk biscuit shaped like a taco. Taco Bell is launching a Biscuit Taco on Thursday in place of its waffle hybrid, which got widespread attention last year when it was included in the rollout of the chain's breakfast menu. The unusual wrap features  fried chicken coated in crushed tortilla chips with either jalapeno honey or country gravy served on the side. Optional extras include sausage, eggs, cheese and bacon. It has between 370 and 470 calories, depending on the fillings, and will cost $2.49 at most restaurants nationwide. Scroll down for video . Novel idea: Taco Bell is launching a 'biscuit taco' this week in place of the 'waffle taco,' which got widespread attention last year when it was included in the rollout of the chain's breakfast menu . Taco Bell CEO, Brian Niccol, told CNBC News that the aim of the breakfast item is to 'make chicken and biscuits portable'. He added that it's 'exciting and tastes great too'. The Biscuit Taco's introduction comes as the chain tries to build on its year-old breakfast business by once again going after the dominant player in the mornings: McDonald's. In a new ad campaign, Taco Bell plans to paint Egg McMuffins as boring, routine food for the brainwashed. In New York and Los Angeles, it is putting up propaganda-like posters for a place called 'Routine Republic,' with one featuring a demonic clown holding what looks like an Egg McMuffin with the words 'Routine Rules.' New addition: Starting Thursday, people can get the baked wrap filled with options like eggs, sausage, cheese or deep-fried chicken and jalapeno honey sauce - it has up to 470 calories, depending on the fillings . Propaganda: In a new ad campaign (above), Taco Bell plans to paint Egg McMuffins as boring, routine food for the brainwashed . National TV ads will feature testimonials from real-life 'defectors' saying things like 'I admit I used to be a McDonald's fan.' It's a continuation of an ad campaign last year that featured real-life people named Ronald McDonald professing their love for Taco Bell offerings. At one point, McDonald's responded by tweeting a photo of Ronald McDonald kneeling down to pet a frail Chihuahua, which was once the mascot for Taco Bell. Some referred to the back-and-forth as 'the breakfast wars.' Whether the biscuit taco has more staying power than the waffle taco remains to be seen. Despite the attention the waffle taco initially generated because of its novelty in the fast-food space, there were early signs it might not last. Not long after it was rolled out, Taco Bell Chief Marketing Officer Chris Brandt noted that 'some of the things on our menu might run out of gas.' Booming business: Already, the launch of a national breakfast menu has helped drive up sales at Taco Bell, which has been trying to redefine itself as a hip brand with its 'Live Mas' slogan . All gone: The biscuit taco at Taco Bell will replace the waffle taco (above) which contained 460 calories and 30g of fat per serving . The chain has also repeatedly said the star of its breakfast menu is the A.M. Crunchwrap, which is a grilled tortilla stuffed with eggs and a hash brown along with sausage, bacon or steak. As for its latest offering, a Taco Bell representative said it's 'more than just a biscuit, it's a warm, fluffy, buttery biscuit, folded in the shape of a taco' and it's here to stay. Already, the launch of a national breakfast menu has helped drive up sales at Taco Bell, which has been trying to redefine itself as a hip brand with its 'Live Mas' slogan. In the latest quarter, the chain's sales rose seven per cent at established locations, driven by breakfast, according to parent company Yum Brands Inc. Taco Bell CEO Brian Niccol said breakfast has been holding steady at about six per cent of sales. That's compared with between 20 and 25 per cent for McDonald's, which has been playing up its own offerings by noting it cracks fresh eggs to make Egg McMuffins. It's not clear what impact Taco Bell's breakfast is having on McDonald's Corp., which has been struggling to hold onto customers more broadly amid intensifying competition. But others have been pushing into the breakfast category more aggressively as well, including Starbucks, which revamped its sandwiches last year.","Starting Thursday, people can get the baked wrap filled with options like eggs, sausage, cheese or deep-fried chicken and jalapeno honey sauce .

"Free to go: Ghoncheh Ghavami, 26, from west London, will not have to return to prison in Iran . A law graduate from west London who was jailed after for trying to attend a men's volleyball game in the Iranian capital will not have to return to prison, her family has said. Ghoncheh Ghavami, 26, was arrested at a Tehran stadium as she tried to attend a volleyball match between Iran and Italy last June. Ghavami, who has dual British and Iranian nationality, was freed on bail in November and has today been told that the remainder of her sentence has been waived. The former law student, from Shepherd's Bush in west London, lodged an appeal against the charges earlier this month. Ms Ghavami spent 151 days in an Iranian prison after being found  guilty of 'propagating against the ruling system'. Her brother, Iman, 28 said: 'As we were celebrating Iranian new year, the Iranian government wiped out the rest of my sister's sentence. 'This means Ghoncheh will not have to spend another day in prison.  This is amazing news. My mum has finally become her old happy self. 'This wouldn't have been possible without the support of everyone who backed my campaign, signed my petition on Change.org and never lost faith that we would eventually bring my sister home.' More than 777,000 people signed a Change.org petition calling for the Ms Ghavami's release. She was taking part in a protest against a ban on women in Iran attending sporting events in the company of men in public stadiums when she was arrested. The Iranian authorities held her in solitary confinement for 41 days in Tehran's Evin Prison from June 30 before moving her to a shared cell. While in prison the University of London's School of African and Oriental Studies graduate staged two hunger strikes, lasting 14 and six days each. In Iran propaganda against the regime is a crime which carries a potential prison sentence of up to one year. Jailed: Ghavami, 26, from Shepherd's Bush, west London, was arrested at a Tehran stadium as she tried to attend a men's volleyball match between Iran and Italy last June . Despite the charges against her being dropped, Ms Ghavami faces a two-year travel ban. Iman Ghavami said that the family had previously heard unconfirmed rumours that his sister was to be pardoned. But it was not until today that she received paperwork confirming that she had effectively been pardoned. Mr Ghavami said: 'My sister now wants to move on with her life. When she was released on bail things were really difficult but they have improved over the last few months. 'She won't be challenging the travel ban because the authorities have been generous but maybe through a dialogue of some sort we can try to have that lifted too. 'The campaign had a tremendous effect from day one. Before it started we were all hopeless and we did not see any other option but to go public. 'When we did, from day one we started to get support and it grew and grew over the months, with people signing the petition from all over the world. 'It has been successful thanks to the support of the people and the press and we will be eternally grateful.'","Ghoncheh Ghavami, 26, was jailed after trying to watch men's match .

"A California high school was brought to a standstill on Monday after staff reported a suspicious package that had been left unattended on the grounds. However after all major precautions were taken - with the campus evacuated and the bomb squad called in to destroy the box - it turned out to be nothing more than some vouchers from KFC. Officials at Willows High School in Glenn County - north of Sacramento -  said they handled the situation a little more drastically than usual after multiple threats were made again the school last week. Suspicious: A package found unattended at Willows High School in Glenn County - north of Sacramento - on Monday and was subsequently destroyed by the bomb squad turned out to be a box of KFC coupons . The threats were allegedly made by three students on social media. Willows High School Principal Holly McLaughlin filed a police report about the three - a 16-year-old male and two females, aged 16 and 17 - after discovering the threats on Twitter. They were posted after a large group staged a protest at the school on Thursday. Instead of going to class at the start of the day, dozens of students took part in a sit-in in the hallway. They were attempting to show support for two popular teachers, Paul Gadbois and Paul Bailey, who had recently lost their jobs. 'Things sort of blew up on social media after the board meeting,' Principal Holly McLaughlin told CBS Sacramento. Administrators say the principal, school board members and their children were threatened on social media. 'It kinda makes you nervous and makes you not wanna go to school at all,' said Willows High junior Ashlynn Geiger, who is the daughter of a school board member. Overly cautious: Willows High School Principal Holly McLaughlin (left) said the situation was handled differently because of recent threats made against her school, while Sgt. Troy McIntrye (right) said the package seemed suspicious upon inspection . Scene: The school campus was evacuated as the bomb squad moved in to inspect the box . Evacuated: Last week, threats were made against the school, after a large group of protested against two teachers losing their jobs . Protest: On Thursday students stayed a sit-in after two popular teachers lost their jobs . On the back of the threats, the staff became worried when they found the unmarked box outside the school entrance on Monday. Police were notified, and initial exams of the package deemed it suspicious. 'It looked suspicious when they did the x-ray,' said Sgt. Troy McIntrye. The premises were evacuated and the bomb squad was called. They destroyed the box, but afterwards realized it was just a collection of coupons from a local KFC. Police do not think it had anything to do with the threats. Principal McLaughlin admitted that, had it been a regular day at the school, a staff member would have likely just opened the box, however they were all on alert.","Unattended package found Monday at Willows High School .

"Colorado's booming marijuana economy saw pot businesses generate a record amount in tax in January 2015. Much of this money is earmarked to be spent on the state's public schools. Data from Colorado's Department of Revenue shows that the Retail Marijuana Excise Tax, which is set at a rate of 15%, raised over $2.3 million in revenue for the public school system that month. In January 2014 the schools pot tax raised only raised $195,318. A public school bus pictured in front of the Colorado State Capitol building. A 15% excise tax on marijuana sales goes towards funding the state's schools . In November 2013 residents of Colorado voted for a 10% sales tax and a 15% excise tax on recreational marijuana sales at licensed stores around the state . Approximately $36.4 million of recreational marijuana was sold in January compared to about $14.69 million sold the same month last year. In November 2013 residents of Colorado voted for a 10% sales tax and a 15% excise tax on recreational marijuana sales. Revenue also comes from a standard sales tax, as well as license fees. The total of all marijuana taxes, licenses, and fees for January 2015 was $ 8,802,295, up from $3,519,756 in 2014. An increase of 150.1%. Revenue not allocated to schools goes to fund police training, substance abuse programs and medical research. Initially only 40 stores were licensed to sell marijuana, but that number has grown to over 320 statewide . The impressive increase in revenue is likely to be most influenced by the number of stores that opened later in 2014.

"Downing Street cynically tried to prevent the release of damaging files exposing the scale of the cover-up over paedophile MP Cyril Smith. The Cabinet Office repeatedly blocked The Mail on Sunday’s attempts to see the bombshell documents – and caved in only after being threatened with High Court action. After the shocking year-long fight, we can reveal the content of the papers, which expose just how much the Establishment knew about the late politician’s sexual and physical abuse of young boys. Scroll down for video . Margaret Thatcher (left) was personally told that police had investigated claims that Cyril Smith (right) indecently assaulted teenage boys in the 1960s . Nick Clegg and David Cameron, both Ministers in the Cabinet Office, have been accused of ‘colluding’ in the latest cover-up of evidence that could expose VIP paedophile rings. The secrecy row will also focus attention on Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, who has become known as ‘Sir Cover-Up’ after blocking the release of dozens of messages exchanged by Tony Blair and George W Bush ahead of the Iraq war. Following The Mail on Sunday’s victory, it can be revealed for the first time that: . - Margaret Thatcher was personally told that police had investigated claims that Smith indecently assaulted teenage boys in the 1960s. - Thatcher was explicitly warned that awarding a knighthood to the 29-stone Liberal MP risked damaging the ‘integrity of the honours system’, but went ahead anyway. - A senior Whitehall mandarin took the ‘exceptional’ step of contacting the country’s top prosecutor and police to find out why Smith was never charged with abusing boys at a hostel he helped run. - Civil servants feared the secret Smith police file might be made public in 1982 – when a burglary at the Fleet Street offices of The Sun newspaper revealed the editor was in possession of a copy. This revelation will lead to speculation that the break-in was linked to attempts to cover up Smith’s crimes. One insider told The Mail on Sunday that the matter is ‘on the Deputy Prime Minister’s desk’. The fact that the Cabinet Office blocked five attempts by The Mail on Sunday to see the papers will deepen fears of a cover-up at the highest levels over the activities of VIP paedophiles. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who exposed the scale of Smith’s abuse in Parliament, said: ‘Nick Clegg and David Cameron have colluded in covering this up. It involves their people and we should not have to learn about this piecemeal because of journalists pestering for information. ‘Both men need to come clean and make a personal commitment to revealing everything that is now held by Government departments. ‘The Prime Minister promised there would be no stone unturned into the inquiry of historic sex abuse in Westminster. But the Cabinet Office seems to be doing the opposite. 'Nick Clegg, who sits in this department, has already written to me refusing to carry out an investigation into who knew what about Cyril Smith in his party and it’s disappointing to see the Cabinet Office continuing this unhelpful approach.’ Smith was knighted in 1988 as recognition of his service as a councillor, mayor and MP in Rochdale, Lancashire. After his death at the age of 82 in 2010, Clegg said he was ‘deeply saddened’ by the loss and said everyone in Rochdale knew him ‘as a friend’. But two years later claims emerged that he repeatedly spanked and sexually abused boys in care homes and hostels, but the authorities saw to it that he was never brought to justice. Nick Clegg (left) and David Cameron (right), both Ministers in the Cabinet Office, have been accused of ‘colluding’ in the latest cover-up of evidence that could expose VIP paedophile rings . The Crown Prosecution Service revealed he had been investigated in 1970, 1988 and 1999 while Greater Manchester Police admitted there had been ‘overwhelming evidence’ that he abused boys both physically and sexually. A year ago, after a battle with campaigners, the Cabinet Office was forced to reveal that former Liberal leader David Steel had proposed Smith for his knighthood. Now The Mail on Sunday has finally been given unprecedented access to the Downing Street files on the case. On April 28 last year, this newspaper put in a Freedom of Information request to the Cabinet Office asking for all No 10 correspondence on Smith’s knighthood, which should have been answered within a month. But officials on four occasions put off providing a response, and then refused a request to review the case. In October we complained to the Information Commissioner’s Office, which ruled last month that the Cabinet Office had broken the law by failing to respond to the original request. The secrecy row will also focus attention on Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood (pictured) The regulator ordered the department provide the information or risk being reported to the High Court where ‘it may be dealt with as a contempt of court’. A Minister in the Cabinet Office would have been called to court to explain why the information had not been disclosed. On Friday the department finally released a 19-page dossier on the-secret discussions that led to Smith being knighted, although other pages were withheld on grounds of national security. The Cabinet Office said: ‘We have released almost all of the information held about this matter. We concluded that the public interest favoured releasing this information rather than applying the usual exemptions that cover honours material. We are sorry that it has taken some time to consult all relevant officials.’ One undated letter, marked ‘secret’, from a leading member of the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee to Mrs Thatcher, warned of ‘the risk that such an award could give rise to adverse criticism’. Lord Shackleton – son of the famous explorer – spelled out that police had investigated Smith in 1970 for ‘indecent assault against teenage boys’ between 1961 and 1966, but that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) had decided ‘there was no reasonable prospect of conviction’. The letter mentions the case was reported in the Rochdale Alternative Press and Private Eye, adding: ‘One may regret this kind of press reporting but it could be revived if an award to Mr Smith were made.’ It also describes a little-known break-in at the The Sun newspaper in 1982 that led police to discover ‘the editor of The Sun had a copy of the 1970 police report’. Lord Shackleton said it would be ‘slightly unfortunate’ if this ‘episode’ stopped Smith being knighted, but added: ‘We felt it right to warn you of our fear that the integrity of the honours system would be at some risk if the award were to be made and announced.’ A second note to the Prime Minister, dated May 1988, admitted the committee had ‘some hesitation’ about the award but concluded: ‘So far as we believe and have been able to ascertain, his past history or general character does not, in all the circumstances, render him unsuitable’. A separate letter from the committee secretary says it decided to give Smith the ‘benefit of the doubt’ as he had never been prosecuted. The secretary had earlier warned Sir Robin Butler, then Cabinet Secretary, that ‘the press might stir up adverse comment’ over Smith’s knighthood ‘if there is fire under this smoke’. To decide the issue they demanded to see the police evidence. Sir Robin wrote to the DPP, saying: ‘The case for taking the exceptional step of writing to you in this way is to protect the Prime Minister (and The Queen) while also being fair to Mr Smith.’ He said the committee wanted to know ‘whether the case against Mr Smith was not well founded: or whether it was a sound case, but that the evidence was not likely to stand up in court’. No reply from the DPP is recorded. The revelations will add to fears that the authorities knew high-profile figures were reportedly child abusers, but tried to keep the allegations secret. The Cabinet Office is still refusing to release even the titles of four recently discovered historic files on child abuse, a decision called ‘disgusting’ by victims’ families. An wide-ranging inquiry into historic allegations of child abuse in Britain has yet to get under way. Last night the Lib Dems said: ‘Cyril Smith’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined. His actions were not known to or condoned by the Liberal Party or the Liberal Democrats.’","Downing Street tried to block release of files exposing scale of cover-up .

"A passing motorist who saw an overturned truck engulfed in flames threw rocks to smash its windshield and ultimately free the driver trapped inside. Larry Coulter told WIVB that he was hauling a load of stones on Monday on the Thruway near Buffalo, New York when one of his tires blew, sending his truck into a guardrail and overturning. The guardrail punctured the fuel tank, igniting a fire that quickly spread threw the truck. With the vehicle's cab on its side, the only door available for Coulter to climb through had been overcome by flames and he quickly realized there was no escape. Scroll down for videos . Terrifying: A burning truck can be seen on the side of the Thruway near Buffalo on Monday. Its driver was saved after a passing motorist threw rocks at the windshield, cracking it and letting him escape . 'The tires were bursting all around me,' he said. 'I just kept thinking it was the end.' He tried to kick out the windshield but the thick smoke made the effort impossible, WIVB reported. Suddenly, a car pulled in front of the truck and its driver, Ed Brunner, jumped out. He attempted to smash the window with a metal bar - but the heat was too much. So instead, he grabbed concrete rocks that had fallen from the truck and started throwing them. To Coulter's disbelief, the man managed to crack the windshield enough for him to kick his way out. 'That guy should have been a professional football player or something,' Coulter said. 'It was just unbelievable.' On footage taken by another passing motorist, Ed Brunner's gray car can be seen, left, in front of the burning truck. The trapped driver, Larry Coulter, thought he was going to die before he saw Brunner approach . Brunner then helped the relieved driver escape. He left the scene before fire crews arrived on the scene and Coulter has not seen his 'guardian angel' since. Coulter, a married father-of-two, was taken to the Erie County Medical Center where he was treated for smoke inhalation. 'He saved my life,' Coulter said of Brunner. 'I owe him eternal gratitude.' But Brunner told WIVB that he's no hero. 'I did it because I saw another man who needed my help,' he said.

"A suspect in a fatal cop shooting was found dead at his home on Wednesday but it was unclear whether he had taken his own life or been killed in an exchange of gunfire with the police. Veteran officer Michael Johnson was shot dead on Tuesday after he responded to a 911 call over a man threatening to commit suicide. The San Jose Police Department said officers were met with gunfire as they approached an apartment building on Tuesday and Johnson was hit by a bullet. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

A witness told KPIX that the gunman was shooting from his balcony, adding: 'He just shot him (the officer) in the head with a rifle.' Police has closed off several streets around the murder scene and authorities enlisted all San Jose police resources in the search. Nearby homes were evacuated and dozens of officers swarmed the areas of Senter and Umbarger to find the gunman, while armored vehicles and a helicopter were summoned from neighboring police agencies. Residents were advised to stay inside as the search intensified, but dozens of people still gathered near the scene, watching as police helicopters circled overhead.

"A dramatic high-speed chase in which police were forced to weave round bales of marijuana hurled out of a speeding SUV has been caught on camera. Officers in Mesa, Arizona, were drawn into the 100mph pursuit after a Chevrolet Trailblazer they were trying to stop took off down the I-8 freeway. Footage from the chase, which took place Wednesday, shows the Trailblazer hurtling along the road as large, green packages are dropped out of the window. Scroll down for video . Abandoned cargo: Sheriff's deputies chasing down suspected drug smugglers had to dodge bales of marijuana they dumped out of their SUV . Arrested: Mario Perez-Paz (left) , 43, and Juan Aguilar-Zavala (right), 21, were booked into jail on drugs offenses and unlawful flight . Deputies from the Pinal County sheriff's department and Gila River police officers chased the SUV, which had two men inside, through a university campus before deflating its tires with spikes in the road. The car then pulled over, and two men fled, but were caught and arrested. Mario Perez-Paz, 43, Juan Aguilar-Zavala, 21, were then booked into jail on drugs possession, smuggling and dealing charges, as well as unlawful flight. The sheriff's office said the men claimed they were offered $1,000 by a woman from Phoenix to make the drugs run. Follow the trail: Deputies say the arrested men then led them to a stash house full of marijuana and illegal immigrants . They also gave officers information that led them to a stash house, where they say they found a huge stash of drugs and 20 illegal immigrants. However, while officers were able to recover 374lbs of marijuana from the house, they admitted that they never got back the bales dumped on the road - which were instead grabbed by drivers passing by. Pinal County sheriff Paul Babeu said: 'These foreign drug smugglers try to outrun our deputies and even throw bales of marijuana from their vehicle. 'We caught these criminals who put our deputies and our local citizens in harm’s way and now they will go to prison for their crimes.'","Officers in Mesa, Arizona, chased fugitives down the I-8 freeway last week .

"A security guard shone a laser pen at the cockpits of passenger planes and a police helicopter while bored on coffee breaks at work. Mark Savage, 27, targeted aircrafts coming in to land at Southampton Airport but claims he was 'was just mucking around' and 'wasn't thinking'. Twice he aimed the beam at passenger planes, one of which was carrying 28 people - but despite risking lives with his reckless behaviour, Savage, of Hampshire, walked free from court today. Spared jail: Mark Savage said he 'was just mucking around' when he shone a laser pen into the cockpits of passenger planes and was spared a prison sentence after a judge heard how he had mental health problems . Sparing him jail, a judge warned how his actions could have caused a crash and stated he 'could not think of anything more dangerous' to do. Recorder Michael Vere-Hodge QC made the decision  after Southampton Crown Court heard how Savage had mental health problems. He shone a beam at a cockpit of a Bombardier Q400 plane on a flight from Jersey that was preparing to land at Southampton Airport just before 9pm on September 9 last year, the court heard . Prosecutor Edward Phillips told the court co-pilot Edward Jarman was reaching a critical point in the landing stage when he saw a light reflecting off the plane's window. Dangerous: Savage aimed the laser beam at several aircrafts including a Flybe plane, which was carrying 28 passengers, forcing the captain to switch off his external lights to land . Mr Phillips said: 'Fortunately the light wasn't in his eyes. He recognised the potential danger but was able to land the plane safely.' A similar Flybe plane behind, captained by Matthew Donnellan, was carrying 28 passengers and three other crew members and was coming in from Paris, France. Mr Phillips said Captain Donnellan had previously suffered temporary blindness and disorientation after a beam had been shone into his eyes so was considerably concerned when he spotted the light from Savage's pen. He made the decision to switch off his external lights, a call he would not usually make, but he considered it less of a risk than being blinded by the laser and was able to land safely. He shone a beam (like the one pictured) at a cockpit of a Bombardier Q400 plane on a flight from Jersey that was preparing to land at Southampton Airport . An image from a previous unrelated incident, in which a laser pen was shone at a helicopter, demonstrates the blinding effect the device can have on pilots . Mr Phillips said the matter was reported to police, who launched the force helicopter and found the source of light was coming from a compound near the Itchen Bridge in Southampton. The pen was discovered under a rock and Savage was arrested and taken to the police station where he admitted being responsible. Savage said he was 'just mucking around' and 'wasn't thinking' and accepted shining it at four or five planes on coffee breaks. Savage, from Totton, Hants, admitted three charges of negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger aircraft. He received a six month suspended sentence with 12 months supervision. David Storry, defending, said his autism and lack of understanding of consequences explains why he shone the light at planes. He said: 'A reasonable person would know the potential consequences of what he was doing. He didn't think through the consequences of his actions and carried on doing it. Also targeted: A Hampshire Police helicopter (like the one above) was called out and officers traced the source of the light and were able to arrest Savage, who admitted responsibility . 'One of his problems is that he gets bored very easily, lacks concentration and acts impulsively. 'He fully understands the case against him. The difficulty is the lack of understanding of the implications of his actions.' Urging the court to impose a suspended sentence, Mr Storry said: 'He is vulnerable and wouldn't take well to a prison regime. He would be a fish out of water.' Recorder Vere-Hodge QC said: 'They were flying over urban areas and if the planes had crash landed, there would have a likely high level number of injuries and damage. 'I cannot think of anything more dangerous in our modern world than shining a beam into the eyes of people flying aircraft. 'I hope you have got it into your head the amount of damage you nearly did and you will never, never put yourself into this kind of situation again.'","Mark Savage targeted aircrafts that were landing at Southampton Airport .

"This amusing video shows a group of Canadian pranksters following customers by dressing up and posing as real Apple Store employees. Introducing themselves at the start of the video, the four men from Toronto explain that they intend to 'quit' their jobs as pretend workers at the computer company. Kyle Forgeard, 20, Jesse Sebastiani, 21, Niko Martinovic, 25 and Marko Martinovic, also 25, are shown speaking to shoppers and giving them advice on the products they are looking to buy. The four pranksters fooled customers after dressing up as Apple Store employees at a Toronto mall . Jesse appears on screen first, where he is approached by a man enquiring about purchasing a new iPhone. After a short discussion, in which the prankster does his best to be as unhelpful as possible, the man turns to leave the shop empty handed. Next to feature in the video is Kyle who is asked a rather technical question regarding an iPad Air. After a little conversation, in which the prankster again chooses to ignore the question, a real employee approaches and asks for the imposter’s name. He says: ‘Sorry, do you even work here,’ before adding: ‘I have never seen you before.’ The pranksters promoted other companies' products when they were questioned about Apple devices . Each prankster drew the attention of customers as they 'quit' their jobs and stormed out of the store . A little discussion ensues, which involves the real employee appearing to call for a manager, until the prankster announces to the room: ‘You know what? Nobody even knows who I am here. I have been here three shifts, I quit.’ Later in the video another prankster is caught talking to a customer and is again approached by a real employee. Interrupting him mid-flow, the man announces to the customer: ‘He doesn’t actually work here,’ to which the prankster retorts that he has done so for the last three months. Eventually he leaves in the same animated way as the previous imposter, with a fellow prankster making his way out of the shop with him. One of the fake Apple Store workers (middle) is kicked out of the store by an employee of the shop . Kyle, right, is confronted by a real member of staff after telling a customer to buy Microsoft products . The video concludes with a prankster talking to a customer about how he thinks he should quit his job before again announcing to the room his intentions and leaving the shop. A number of customers look around and laugh as the two men make their dramatic exits. The four men are known for recording a number of prank videos, which they upload to their YouTube channel NelkFilmz. The last video they filmed, entitled ‘Coke Prank on Cops’, involved the foursome insinuating that they had cocaine to sell. One of the actors storms out of the Apple Store after announcing he is quitting in front of customers . Instead, as the police later discovered after stopping them, the men were actually transporting cans of Coca-Cola. The clip received criticism at the time, with the LAPD telling NBC News that the prank was irresponsible. Commander Andrew Smith of the LAPD said: 'It is dangerous for the participants involved and a huge waste of a police officer's time.' 'The public has a right to have their police officers working and not wasting their time responding to juvenile pranks.'

"The Liberal Democrats were accused last night of using public money to garner votes after it emerged that more than 80 per cent of places to benefit from a new fuel subsidy will be in their own seats. Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander said 17 rural areas would benefit from a 5p a litre cut in fuel duty after a scheme – funded by the British taxpayer – was signed off by the European Commission. But 14 are in Lib Dem seats, including two in Mr Alexander’s own constituency in the Scottish Highlands. Labour suggested there should be an inquiry into so-called ‘pork barrel politics’ by the Lib Dems, who also boast of channelling cash for roads and schools to their own seats. Mr Alexander, MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, has faced repeated claims that he is shoring up votes in his seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere. In the past, cash has been found for a tax break for ski lifts, a bailout for a sleeper train from London to Scotland and green levies scrapped for a tourist train in the Cairngorms. In January, Nick Clegg announced plans for a £300million ‘city deal’ for Inverness, including £2million to promote Loch Ness and its mythical monster to tourists. Shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie suggested the deals should be investigated by the Commons public accounts committee to see if they represent value for money. At the pumps: Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander said 17 rural areas would benefit from a 5p a litre cut in fuel duty after a scheme – funded by the British taxpayer – was signed off by the European Commission . Mr Leslie said: ‘While I’m sure there are many living in rural areas who would love a fuel duty cut, it seems more than a coincidence that this is largely restricted to Danny Alexander’s backyard and those of his small band of Lib Dem colleagues. ‘Taken together with the very convenient tax break for his local ski lift, there’s something very fishy about these decisions, and perhaps the public accounts committee ought to investigate.’ Nick Clegg has promised to create a Cornish Assembly in a bid to shore up his party’s vote in the county. The Deputy Prime Minister (right) made the pledge as he yesterday embarked on a tour of the key Lib Dem battleground. The party is desperately trying to avoid a wipeout in the county where it once held all six seats. Currently, three of the area’s MPs are Lib Dems. Mr Clegg said that he would create a Cornish Assembly, similar to that in Wales, which could allow the Cornish to choose different rules to the rest of England in areas potentially relating to second home ownership and bus services. But the plans dismissed as ‘ill-considered’ and a ‘nonsense’ by Cornish nationalists. Mr Clegg said: ‘When the Cornish Assembly is born, it would be up to those who are elected to shape Cornwall’s destiny. 'We could change planning law and council tax so buying up second homes in Cornwall comes with a greater price.’ Nine areas benefiting from the new ‘rural fuel rebate’ are in the Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency of former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy who is facing a desperate fight with the SNP to hang on to his seat. Two are in Mr Alexander’s seat, and another two are in the constituency of his Lib Dem neighbour John Thurso. Another beneficiary is Lynton, North Devon, in the constituency of former Lib Dem defence minister Sir Nick Harvey, and one of only four seats in England to benefit. Others are in Cumbria, Northumberland and North Yorkshire. Mr Alexander said the move will help up to 125,000 people in areas faced with some of the highest fuel prices in the country. It is the first time the European Union has approved a fuel discount for people living on the UK mainland. Currently, islanders off the coast of Scotland and in the Isles of Scilly are eligible for a 5p discount on petrol and diesel because the cost of transporting fuel there means pump prices are much higher. The scheme will be extended to 17 mainland areas at the end of May. A source close to Mr Alexander denied the scheme was designed to favour Lib Dem seats. He said the selection process had been ‘evidence-based’. ‘This is testament to how hard Danny has fought and campaigned on this issue over many years,’ he said. ‘Danny represents a rural community with many remote areas and so he knows first-hand the extra financial burden this puts on families and businesses facing high fuel costs while relying on cars to travel long distances.’","Danny Alexander says 17 rural areas will benefit from drop in fuel duty .

Jeffrey Williams, who was involved in the demonstrations, is accused of two counts of assault on a police officer, firing a weapon out of a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action in relation to the incident on Thursday. If convicted of the crimes, he faces life in prison. The shooting sent a fresh jolt of tension through a city that became a symbol of racial conflict after black teenager Michael Brown was killed by white officer Darren Wilson last summer . A grand jury later returned no criminal charges. On Sunday, Robert McCulloch, St Louis County prosecutor, said  Williams  admitted to officials that he had fired a gun. However, the suspect claimed he was trying to hit someone else with whom he was arguing, Mr McCulloch said. 'We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,' the prosecutor said at a press conference, adding there might have been other people in a vehicle Williams is accused of shooting from. Mr McCulloch also confirmed that shell casings that were found at the scene have been linked to a handgun that was taken off of Williams. At the time of the shooting there was a warrant out for the suspect's arrest after failing to show up to sessions with his probation officer. He had been convicted for receiving stolen goods. It comes as anti-police protesters have resumed demonstrations outside Ferguson police station. Many were seen arguing with pro-authority demonstrators and officials on Sunday afternoon.

Williams is being held on $300,000 bond. The north St. Louis County resident was on probation in St. Louis County for receiving stolen property, Mr McCulloch said.

Officer Wilson was cleared by the Justice Department's report and a grand jury led by McCulloch declined to indict him in November. The federal report found widespread racial bias in the city's policing and in a municipal court system driven by profit extracted from mostly black and low-income residents.

"Putting on silly voices is just one of the things adults do to bring a smile to a baby’s face. And what’s better than helium for distorting your voice to make you sound like a friendly chipmunk? Well, for baby Lincoln, the answer appears to be anything. Filmed sitting on what seems to be his mother’s lap, Lincoln, who appears to be from America, is joined by his uncle Carson, who holds a purple balloon. After inhaling the helium, Carson says: ‘Hey Lincoln, how are you?’ in a sinister high-pitched voice while looking at his nephew. Reacting in shock to the sudden change in his uncle’s voice, Lincoln immediately looks stunned and his bottom lip begins to tremble. As his uncle starts giggling like a chipmunk it all becomes too much for baby Lincoln and he bursts into tears. So far so good: Lincoln sits on what appears to be his mother's lap while his uncle inhales helium from a purple balloon . Responding sympathetically, the youngster’s uncle says: ‘Oh no, no,’ but his high-pitched voice only makes things worse. Eventually, Lincoln is lifted away from his uncle, who laughs apologetically. Helium makes your voice sound high-pitched because it is lighter than air and sound waves can travel through it faster. When inhaling helium, the type of gas molecules in the vocal tract change and increase the voice’s speed of the sound, making it squeaky. Not impressed: Uncle Carson speaks to his nephew in a high-pitched voice that makes the youngster's bottom lip tremble . Oh dear: Baby Lincoln starts crying and is swiftly lifted away from his uncle who laughs apologetically .","The uncle inhales helium from a balloon and speaks in a squeaky voice .

"A London woman is embroiled in a fight for compensation with Jet Airways after toilets and sinks overflowed and smelly water seeped into the cabin during an eight-hour flight. Passengers, including two families with infant children, were forced to endure the pungent smell for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London. Traveller Amrita Jaurre snapped photos as water flowed into the aisles and rows, and cabin crew scrambled to contain the mess by piling newspapers on the floor. Photos show water trickling into the aisle (left) and newspapers that were used to soak up the mess (right) The 27-year-old office worker told MailOnline Travel: ‘After two hours, myself and other passengers noticed water seeping out from under the two lavatories closest to our seats. ‘We complained to the air steward who took no notice at first but once the overflow become more obvious, he realised we were not over exaggerating. ‘He then told us that the water was overflowing from the toilet and sink in both lavatories, so you can imagine the smell that we then had to endure for the remainder of the flight.’ She added: ‘It was quite difficult to tell whether the liquid contained human waste, but it would not surprise me as … the liquid overflowing from the lavatories definitely had a foul urine-like smell.’ Passengers were forced to cover their mouths and noses with scarves or clothing to escape the stench. However, the airline claims the water was simply leaking from sinks. Passengers used articles of clothing to cover their mouths and noses as water flowed into the cabin . In an attempt to cover the smell a flight attendant sprayed the wet patches with an air freshener. Amrita said: ‘This then led to complaints from a nearby passenger who suffered from asthma and couldn't be near such a strong fragrance without risking an asthma attack. ‘After this, the flight attendant went back to check on the lavatories and almost gagged when he opened the door so I can only imagine the state of the toilets.’ Amrita said the situation became worse over the course of the flight last month as the toilet and sink in the lavatory on the opposite side of the plane began to overflow as well. Passengers were forced to endure the stench for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London . She said she lodged a complaint on Twitter after returning to London, and the Mumbai-based airline offered an apology. She complained again and was offered a 2,000-point credit for Jet Airways’ frequent flyer club. She wasn’t satisfied with the offer, saying: ‘Personally, I have no intention to ever fly with Jet Airways again after that experience. A spokesperson for Jet Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Jet Airways regrets any inconvenience caused to guests on board flight 9W122 DEL - LHR dt.,Feb 15, 2015, on account of reverse drainage from the sinks on board the aircraft. 'As per our investigation, the overflow was only of water from the sink. All human waste is carried by separate system and lines which functioned normally during the flight.' Jet Airways investigated the incident and maintains the liquid leaking was coming from the sinks . Ms Jaurre said: ‘Ideally, I would like compensation from Jet Airways because I feel that their offer of frequent flyer miles isn't sufficient, given that I was already quite ill on the flight and it didn't help then having to sit in that unhygienic and filthy cabin. ‘I'm unsure if any other passengers became ill but as the liquid continued to overflow and the smell became more evident, it gave me a very bad headache and made me nauseous which put me off my in-flight meal.’ She added: ‘I became quite ill after the flight with a combination of throat infection, ear infection and stomach pains and had to take a week off from work to get better. Whether these were a direct result of the situation on-board, I cannot say but it definitely didn't help.’ She is seeking monetary compensation plus a refund to cover the cost of the ticket. ‘Nobody should ever have to sit through such disgusting in-flight conditions and the right checks should have been made to the aircraft to ensure things like this shouldn't have happened.’","Passengers, including infant children, endured the pungent smell for hours .

The biological mother of Rosie O'Donnell's eldest daughter has claimed the controversial comedian took advantage of her drug addiction to 'steal' her newborn child away from her. In an explosive interview, Deanna Micoley, 37, says ex The View host Rosie, 53, should not have been able to take her girl because O'Donnell knew she signed off on the adoption while high on heroin. Speaking to the National Enquirer, Deanna accuses O'Donnell of stealing her baby girl who is now 17 and claims that she is back in contact with her daughter who now hates the multi-millionaire. 'I believe Rosie O'Donnell knew that I was in no condition to sign away my parental rights to my daughter,' said Deanna to the Enquirer. 'She did the worst thing one woman can do to another woman - take her child!' According to Deanna, she was unhappily married when she gave birth in August 1997 to a little girl she named Kayla. She allegedly claims that two months after the birth her husband fed her heroin and forced her to put Kayla up for adoption. 'I may not have been the best mother back then,' said Deanna to the National Enquirer. 'I did drugs and I have a criminal record because of it. But surely I didn't deserve to have my baby stolen from me.' Now recovered from her drug fight and living in Wisconsin, she has re-married and is the mother of four children. However, she is insistent that what she wants most is to welcome home her first child. 'Rosie O'Donnell stole my baby, but I don't want her money. I just want my daughter back.' Mother and superstar: Rosie O'Donnell, center, and her children Parker and Chelsea arrive at the opening night performance of the Broadway musical 'American Idiot' in New York in 2010 . Deanna was stunned to reconnect with the daughter she claims she was forced to give up in November, when Chelsea managed to find Micoley's father - her biological grandfather. O'Donnell's publicist Cindi Berger said that her client absolutely legally adopted Chelsea from the non-profit Children of the World in New Jersey in 1997. 'The agency never would have accepted the baby if the birth mother was under the influence,' said Berger. 'There are notarized adoption papers signed by the birth mother and father that were accepted by both the adoption agency and the court. (My client)'Is unbearably proud of Chelsea and has encouraged and supported Chelsea's desire to communicate with her birth mother. How disappointing that Chelsea's birth mother would go public with this personal story without ever having met Rosie.' 'Chelsea told him that she was his granddaughter,' said Deanna to the National Enquirer. 'He called me and broke the news. It was the moment I'd been waiting and praying for the last 17 years - I'd found my precious daughter.' Over the past few months, Deanna and Chelsea have been in contact through Facebook and text. It was during these exchanges that Chelsea allegedly revealed she is having problems with her adoptive mother. 'Chelsea has told me she had issues with Rosie,' said Deanna to the Enquirer. 'I believe Rosie has abandoned her. Since about the age of 12, Rosie basically shipped off Chelsea to different boarding schools.' When asked why she was given up for adoption, Deanna said she told Chelsea the truth. 'I said her daddy wasn't a good person and she was basically given up to an adoption agency,' said Micoley. Family ties: The resemblance between Chelsea as a young girl and her half-sister (seen right in a picture from Deann's Facebook page) is undeniable . Together: In an undated photo, Blake and Chelsea appear with their adoptive mother Rosie O'Donnell on a balcony . Deanna also claims that O'Donnell is trying to turn her adopted daughter against her biological mom. The Emmy award winning comedian allegedly wrote a message to Deanna saying that her fame was 'superhuman' and that caused her daughter to feel 'overlooked' sometimes. 'Rosie even hired someone to dig up my criminal record and gave it to Chelsea,' said Deanna to the Enquirer. Deanna also shared some of the exchanges she has been having with O'Donnell. In them O'Donnell refutes the adoption was a sham and asks her to stop claiming otherwise. “It was all legal. Like it or not. Now stop.” Deanna claims they had exchanges in which O'Donnell referenced paying for her and her husband's living expenses and even bought them a TV. These revelations are just the latest bombshell to hit O'Donnell and her checkered family history. The outspoken LGBT and adoption advocate first adopted son Parker in 1995 as a single mother. She then adopted Chelsea in 1997. She produced a HBO documentary special called A Family is a Family is a Family five years ago which examined the growth in non-traditional families and societies changing perception of the family unit. In the early 00s, O'Donnell and partner Kellie Carpenter fostered a child who they hoped to adopt. However, at the time, Florida's law prohibited gay couples from adopting - which deeply affected her views on the process across the country. Family picture: Before her split from Michelle Rounds (pictured left) Rosie O'Donnell posed for this picture with Chelsea (bottom left), Vivienne (center) and Blake (right) and posted it to Instagram . In 1999 she adopted her son Blake with her partner Kelli Carpenter - who also gave birth to their daughter, Vivienne via IVF in 2002. The couple married in 2004 and split in 2007. O'Donnell adopted her fifth child, Dakota in 2013, together with her second wife, Michelle Rounds. They split recently just before O'Donnell left The View, just four months after rejoining the cast.","Deanna Micoley, 37, gave birth to daughter Kayla in August 1997 .

"'Monster': Convicted child killer Osvaldo Rivera, 34, Osvaldo Rivera, 34, has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 2-year-old boy . A southern New Jersey man who is in prison for killing a 6-year-old boy has admitted sexually assaulting a 2-year-old in a separate case. Osvaldo Rivera, 34, pleaded guilty to sexual assault Monday. Under terms of the plea deal, Rivera faces 15 years in prison to be served concurrently with the 110-year sentence he is already facing after a jury found him guilty of the murder of 6-year-old Dominick Andujar and the sexual assault of that boy's 12-year-old sister, Amber in September 2012. The sexual assault of the younger child, a 2-year-old boy, was the month before that. The Camden County Prosecutor's Office said DNA evidence submitted to a state database helped link Rivera to the crime. Rivera is scheduled to be sentenced in the toddler assault case April 17. 'Rivera had to be held accountable for the crime he committed against this toddler, regardless of having been previously sentenced to life in prison in another case,' Assistant Prosecutor Christine Shah told Philadelphia Inquirer. In July 2014, a Camden jury found Osvaldo Rivera guilty of the murder of Dominick Andujar, as well as charges of attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault, burglary and weapons violations.

At around midnight on September 2, 2012, Rivera broke into the Andujar family's home in Camden and attacked then 12-year-old Amber Andujar as she slept on the couch. Amber began to scream, which awoke 6-year-old Dominick - and he rushed to his sister's aid. The small boy fought with the attacker and managed to free his sister in the process. Amber, who was bleeding after being slashed in the throat by Rivera, ran to a neighbor's home to call for help. By the time police arrived on the scene, the brave 6-year-old boy was dead after having his throat slashed.

Capture: Rivera was found hiding behind a mattress in a home in Camden after the attack . Defiant: Amber Andujar (left) survived despite having her throat cut so deeply that paramedics could see her vocal chords . Rivera fled the house after killing Dominick, and Amber was later seen running through the neighborhood, screaming for help while bleeding profusely from the throat. Emergency responders said the cuts were so deep they could see Amber's vocal cords. She later helped officers locate her rapist by telling them he was known by the nickname ’Popeye’ and lived in a Camden apartment. Police tracked him down to an apartment in the city and found him hiding between an upturned mattress and the wall. According to investigators, during his questioning Rivera had revealed that he had smoked 'wet,' a combination of marijuana and PCP, prior to the killing. During Rivera's sentencing last December, a defiant Amber Andujar declared: 'Today I stand here as a survivor. Even though he took a part of me away, in the end, you did not win.'","Osvaldo Rivera, 34, faces 15 years in prison to be served concurrently with the 110-year sentence he is already serving .

"A medieval castle in Tuscany set over more than 1,500 acres has gone on sale in Italy making it the largest private home on the market. The stunning estate found slightly east of Siena boasts farmhouses, vineyards, woodland and sunflower fields in its grounds. Built in the early 12th Century it is one of few medieval castles which remain in Europe and is thought to have been the home of Pope Pius II and III at one time. The property, whose owners wish to keep themselves and the castle's name unknown, is being sold by Sotheby's International for 28 million euros - almost £20million. Scroll down for video . A medieval castle in Tuscany set over more than 1500 acres has gone on sale for just under £20million making it the largest private home on the property market . The castle has its own restaurant where wines made from the grapes in its vineyards are served alongside produced farmed from the grounds . While it is not known who first lived in the castle or commissioned its construction the property remained in the hands of one prominent family for centuries. The Piccolomini family are thought to have lived there intermittently from the 15th Century. Two of the family's most notable members, Enea Silvio Piccolomini and Francesco Piccolomini went on to become Popes Pius II and III. Little is known of how the noble family cultivated their wealth other than that many of their riches were acquired through trading. Having spent decades in the ownership of the family, the castle it changed hands sometime in the 1920s. The new owner remained anonymous, selling on the sprawling estate again in the 1980s. It has since remained in the possession of its current owners who refused to disclose why they were moving on. While estate agents are reluctant to reveal exactly where in the rolling Tuscan hills the special property can be found, they promised it to be one of rare value. 'It's very rare in Italy to have a medieval castle, there are so many that came before and after, mostly after, but to find a medieval one is rare,' said John Jonk, who is handling the sale for Sotheby's International. 'All the original fireplaces and ceilings are in tact. It's a very special opportunity.' While in total the estate has more than 100 bedrooms most are found in farmhouses and smaller properties scattered across its grounds. These are rented out as holiday accommodation while its vineyard and restaurant attracts diners. In the castle itself are 10 bedrooms and as many bathrooms, a drawing room and dining room. Elsewhere on its sprawling grounds are sunflower fields and farmland, added Mr Jonk. The villa just east of Sienna is one of few from the early 12th Century which remain in Italy. All its fireplaces and ceilings have been preserved from their original state . Aside from the property's 10-bedroom main castle there are several farmhouses scattered around its grounds from the same era . The Piccolomini family are thought to have lived in the castle intermittently from the 15th Century and two of the family's most notable members, Enea Silvio Piccolomini and Francesco Piccolomini went on to become Popes Pius II and III . The castle is a very rare find in Italy because it dates back to medieval times, according to John Jonk, who is handling the sale for Sotheby's International . Mysteriously the existence of the castle is not widely known and it has never really been filmed or appeared on television . The castle also has its own chapel and vineyard. It belonged to the same family for generations before being sold privately in 1920 . 'There's a lot of woodland, there's a vineyard. 'From some parts of the property there are views of Siena too.' Although the property is one of the few remaining of its kind in Italy it has remained mysteriously off the radar for decades. 'That's the interesting part - there have been television crews that have come from Rome over the years and have interviewed people in the restaurant in the castle but it hasn't really been used for filming or anything like that,' Mr Jonk said. In its restaurant staff serve red wine and food produced on the grounds. With herds of boar and deer roaming its fields too there is no shortage of wildlife to entertain visitors. 'When people talk about organic foods, this is what is meant. In Italy everything is still quite good that way, it's very organic.' Despite its large price tag, Mr Jonk added the property had attracted attention from all over the world. 'We have had interest from European buyers and non-European buyers. 'It's a special opportunity for someone who can afford it but, as I tell my clients, to find an exclusive property in London nowadays wouldn't cost much less.'

The estate has attracted interest from potential buyers across the globe , despite its rather large price tag .

Sotheby's John Jonks said: 'It's a special opportunity for someone who can afford it but, as I tell my clients, to find an exclusive property in London nowadays wouldn't cost much less.' With sprawling grounds, multiple smaller properties and access to your own vineyard, many can see the perks of paying £20million for their own Tuscan castle in Italy. But any hopes of snapping up a similar deal closer to home have been dashed by the ever inflating prices of London flats. For roughly the same price as the castle near Siena, house-hunters can just about afford a three-bedroom flat in the heart of the capital. While One Hyde Park apartments afford owners an exclusive postcode and plush surroundings - set between Harrods and Harvey Nichols in London's Knightsbridge - the glass-fronted flats don't quite offer as much space. In fact the internal floor space of one flat sold last year for more than £20million was less than 4,000 sq ft.

"Disney Channel star Debby Ryan has revealed further details about her relationship with an abusive male friend, just a few months after sharing for the first time the level of abuse she had suffered at his hands. The 21-year-old star of Jessie and The Suite Life on Deck told People how the friend, whose identity is not known, was 'emotionally and mentally abusive' - and how she finally decided enough was enough. 'I was like, ""I'm a powerful woman and I'm a producer"",' she said. 'I never thought that this [would be] happening to me, and it was absolutely happening to me. It was kind of late in the game by the time I realized that this was not healthy.' Scroll down for video . Severing ties: Disney star Debby Ryan, 21, says it took her a long time to realize one of her close friendships was deeply unhealthy . 'It was a couple of years ago,' the Alabama-born actress explained, adding that the abuse first began at a time when her life seemed 'amazing' - she was the star of one hit Disney Channel show and already had another one under her belt. But she says one of her close friends began growing increasingly jealous and demanding of her time and attention. The star described how on one occasion, her obsessive friend followed her to her car, grabbed her wrists, and took her keys, before crawling into her passenger side window so Debby couldn't leave to see her other friends. False friends: Debby says her friend would call her phone up to 40 times a day and would grow angry if she didn't answer his calls immediately . The abusive friend - who Debby insists is not her ex-boyfriend, Twenty One Pilots drummer Josh Dun - also tried to move in with her, so Debby paid for a nearby hotel room to to give him another place to stay. 'That was literally just for sleeping,' she explained, adding that the pair would still see each other 'every day, hours a day, month on month on month'. When her friend threatened to kill himself if Debby didn't spend more time with him, the actress realized that  it was time to put an end to the relationship once and for all. On top of her game: Few of her other friends knew about Debby's struggle; most of the time, like on the set of her show Jessie, the star's life seemed carefree . Back to normal: Now free of her destructive friendship, the actress was all smiles at her show's 100th episode party on February 12 . 'I realized I'd done everything that I could do,' she said. 'It's not my purpose to sacrifice my own happiness and sacrifice my own mental health so that this guy doesn't overdose. 'I called someone and had someone go and be with him, and I removed myself from the situation and realized he's no longer mine to deal with.' Now, Debby has decided to speak up to help other young people cope with abusive relationships. She has teamed up with Mary Kay and Love Is Respect's Don't Look Away campaign, which offers abusive relationship counseling over text message to those who text 'loveis' to 22522.","Debby, 21, says her friend chased her, grabbed her, and wouldn't let her spend time with other friends .

"The top ten list of the most expensive clothes and props from some of the most famous films in movie history has been revealed by memorabilia experts. Sold for  £2.9m ($4.5m), the dress Actress Audrey Hepburn wore in My Fair Lady was the most valuable item  on the list.

Audrey Hepburn's Ascot dress (left), from My Fair Lady (1964), sold in 2011 for £2.9m ($4.5m) - The film based on the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion won eight Oscars . Obvious box office favourites like Star Wars and the Wizard of Oz were on the list, but it was the dress Audrey Hepburn wore in the Ascot scene of the critically acclaimed 1964 musical that topped the lot. Second on the list was James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 which featured in Goldfinger and Thunderball which sold for £2.67m ($4.1m) in 2010. A prop from the all-time classic film Casablanca - the piano from Rick's Cafe Americain - came in third. It sold last year for £2.2m ($3.3m). Original props and costumes from The Wizard of Oz were among the most sought-after and valuable of all movie memorabilia, with the most expensive being the original costume worn by Burt Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. The costume, which was made from genuine lion skin and fur, sold last year for a record £2m ($3.077m).

The list was compiled by Picollecta, an online community for collectors. Dawn Bruce, from Picollecta said: 'I think the reason pieces like these sell so well is because of how iconic the films are. 'The My Fair Lady dress is one of Audrey Hepburn's most popular films, along with Breakfast At Tiffany's, and the style in that film is held in high regard. 'It's the same with pieces from Casablanca and The Wizard of Oz, it represents a time in cinema that seems so far away now, so different from ours.

'A film doesn't have to be award-winning for the memorabilia to do well, it's to do with how much of a following a film has. 'Many people now are much more interested in buying a piece of movie history than say an antique vase. It feels more personal to them as films are a huge part of people's lives. 'I think there is a bit of competition between high end collectors. People with private collections want to own the most iconic, instantly recognisable pieces.' 1.

"Labour MP Simon Danczuk has confessed to watching pornography but insisted voters want politicians who 'live in the real world'. The husband of selfie-loving Karen Danczuk was spotted favouriting hard-core porn on Twitter - but blamed it on a fault with his iPhone. However, the 48-year-old was unembarrassed about the gaffe. He stressed he does not use porn regularly, but insisted: 'I am a man of the world and it is part of life, many people do.' And wife Karen urged people to watch porn, claiming it is 'healthy'. Scroll down for video . Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk, pictured right, the husband of selfie-loving Karen, pictured left, was spotted favouriting hardcore porn on Twitter . It came as Mrs Danczuk was invited to host the UK Porn Awards, although she has apparently turned down the opportunity. Mr Danczuk explained that he accidentally favourited a tweet  linked to an account described as 'an 18+ Erotic account for posting sexy pictures of sexy women'. The Rochdale MP does not follow the account, which features dozens of pornographic pictures of women. Giving a convoluted explanation for the gaffe, he told radio station Key 2 in Manchester: ‘This is genuinely true. It’s what you might call a technological accident. 'I had put my iPhone on charge using one of those uncertified chargers. I went on to Twitter while it was plugged in. 'And when I went on Twitter it started jumping about. It started doing predictive text and moving around the screen everywhere. 'Before I knew it, and unbeknown to me, I had favorited a tweet which related to this porn site image.' He insisted that politicians should not be berated for viewing porn. 'Let’s be truthful about this. If I am being asked have I ever used porn, then the answer is yes. 'I am a man of the world. I wouldn’t deny that sort of thing. I think we should not be too sanctimonious about this. 'I think there is far too much of that in politics and I think don’t put politicians on a pedestal. Let’s just have real conversations about real issues. 'The reality is politicians are under scrutiny and many others have been caught out on this.' MP's wife Karen Danczuk took to Twitter to urge people to watch porn, insisting it is 'healthy' He pointed out that one of David Cameron's official accounts was found to be following a 'high class escort agency' on Twitter while fellow Labour MP Jack Dromey like a tweet from 'some gay porn site'. It’s something that easily happens. We are under a lot of scrutiny,' Mr Danczuk said. Asked if he watches porn regularly, he replied: ‘Not regularly but the point I am making is I am not going to come on this show and say I haven’t. 'I am a man of the world and it is part of life, many people do. Let’s not be sanctimonious about it. Wife Karen, who has made a name for herself posting photos of her cleavage online, tweeted yesterday: 'Anyone seriously offended by a bit of porn favouriting?? Come on,if you're not watching it yourself you really need to. It's healthy.' Mr Danczuk added: 'I have had a real laugh about it. It is not really a massive policy political issue is it? I think the public get that. They want politicians who do live in the real world.' The MP, who has campaigned against child sexual exploitation, hit the headlines last week when he said in an interview in the New Statesman that Ed Miliband was considered more of a 'toff' by voters than David Cameron. A constituent in Rochdale flagged up the blunder by tweeting the MP, pictured above . The interview was brought up by Jeremy Paxman during Thursday's live TV debate with Mr Miliband and David Cameron. Mr Danczuk also clashed with controversial columnist Katie Hopkins on Twitter over race relations. Hopkins has criticised him for posting a picture of himself in Rochdale next to a Pakistani flag. She linked it to the child sex grooming scandal in the town, which led to jailing of a gang of Asian men for 77 years in 2012. But Mr Danczuk accused her of spreading 'vitriol' and of 'racist generalisation'.

"Strewn with filthy sleeping bags, burnt-out beer cans, clothes and shoes, this is the scene left behind as the last migrants move out of an illegal camp in Calais. What was once a sports hall for factory workers resembles a rubbish dump, with mattresses, cardboard boxes and tents all abandoned. The detritus has been left by the 2,000-strong group of migrants who have been sleeping rough on the site for more than a year as they try to reach Britain. Scroll down for video . Eviction: Police patrol the camp yesterday as a few remaining migrants pack their few belongings ready to leave the former sports hall . Bleak: A migrant cycles past the detritus left behind after most of the squatters moved out of the illegal camp which was dubbed the Jungle . They were given until yesterday to vacate their illegal camp – dubbed the Jungle – or face arrest. Many have simply upped sticks and moved half a mile along the coast to a new camp, much to the horror of local residents. The port’s outspoken mayor has already blamed Britain’s benefits system for attracting the migrants, thousands of whom have massed in Calais waiting for an opportunity to sneak into lorries, cars or caravans and enter Britain. And last night, the deputy mayor said he was working to have border checks moved from the town back to England. The migrants were given until yesterday to vacate their illegal camp – which is also known as the Jungle – or face arrest . Police are pictured arresting a migrant inside the new migrant camp in Les Dunes,Calais, which has been dubbed Sangatte 2 . Philippe Mignonet said: ‘I speak to a lot of the migrants, and when I see them, I wish them good luck – I tell them I hope they succeed. They have a dream. ‘I am fed up every morning to see the news, that it is Calais’ problem, that we are responsible. 'The English are hypocrites, their destination is not Calais, it’s England. 'The answer is to move the border back to England.’ He added: ‘Why is David Cameron not coming to Calais? Why? I know he is a busy man but I am sure someone in his government has told him many times what is happening here.’ Yesterday, a handful of migrants yet to leave were gathering their few belongings and walking to their new home. French police sources said they would use force to remove any remaining on the site today. Many migrants have left their tents and rubbish and moved half a mile along the coast to a new camp - to the horror of local residents . The port’s outspoken mayor has already blamed Britain’s benefits system for attracting the migrants branding the UK 'hypocritical' It is going to cost thousands of pounds to clean the tents and rubbish from the site, which was once a sports hall for factory workers . It will cost thousands of pounds to clean the area. Tifa Hussan, a 28-year-old computer graduate from Sudan, had been living at the site since December. ‘The police told us about a month ago that we all had to move to the new camp,’ he said. ‘Most people left within the last week, but I am going to stay. This is my home. I don’t want to move. They can beat me. I am not afraid of them. I want to go England and find a job. ‘It is a good place. I have friends who have gone there and I want to join them.’ The new, official camp provides beds, showers, toilets, a laundry service and medical facilities for migrant women. Dubbed the ‘new Sangatte’, it will offer legal advice for migrants wishing to apply for asylum in the UK and will cost about £6million a year to run. Half of the bill will be paid using a £3million ‘special’ grant from the EU which would include money from UK taxpayers. The other half is paid by the French government. Men are not allowed to stay, but can use the facilities during the day. Many have set up their tents in the sand dunes nearby. The new camp is a few minutes walk from the main road, where migrants jump on lorries bound for the UK. Police pick their way through Jungle camp in Calais after most of the inhabitants moved to a new camp just half a mile down the road . The camp has been left strewn with filthy sleeping bags, burnt-out beer cans, clothes and shoes alongside larger items including tents . Men are not allowed to stay in the new legal camp at night - but many have set up their tents in the sand dunes nearby (pictured) The original Sangatte was used by an estimated 60,000 migrants as a springboard for illegal entry into the UK. After it was bulldozed in 2002, migrants built various makeshift camps in the town including the Jungle, where a British journalism student was raped in 2008. But last summer French officials decided a new centre should be built as the number of people living rough in the port had swelled. Yesterday, workmen from the local public works department were preparing the new site for the migrants, including building a small road for access. Zakir, a 32-year-old from Afghanistan, said: ‘No one wanted to move but the police want us all on one site so they can keep a close eye on us.’ He added: ‘This is not a good place. There is no drinking water or shelter from the wind. At least at our old camp we could keep out of the wind, were able to get water. We have nothing here.’ Yards away, police arrested a young man and led him away in handcuffs after searching his tent. Mr Mignonet said: ‘People living nearby are worried, and understandably so, but what can we do?’ ■ Eleven suspected illegal immigrants believed to be from Syria were yesterday handed over to border force officials after being arrested on the M20. Police were called at 7.15am after the group of men were seen climbing down from a tanker or lorry at the slip road near Folkestone. Once a sports hall the site now resembles a dump, with mattresses, cardboard boxes and tents abandoned alongside clothes and shoes .

"Two people died and two others are in critical condition after a train and car collided in Louisville Kentucky, police said. The Toyota sedan was attempting to cross the train tracks on Saturday at about 4pm and apparently 'disregarded the traffic control signs in the area' before it was struck on the passenger side, according to police. There are no barriers in the area blocking the tracks for when a train passes. Chita Chuwan, 16, and Suk Man Rai, 19, were pronounced dead at the scene at 4.09pm after sustaining multiple blunt-force injuries. Scroll down for video .

I've never seen anything like that,' Collman told WDRB. 'The car did not slow down whatsoever. I did not see any brake lights whatsoever on the car.' Collman added that there should be gates at the crossing and that the lights and signal horns are not sufficient. 'There needs to be crossing gates because of the curvature of this road. There needs to be gates put at this crossing,' he said. Louisville Police and federal investigators are investigating the crash.

"Dave Chappelle was not amused when a drunken man hurled a banana peel at him during a stand-up show in New Mexico Monday night. Christian Englander, 30, of Santa Fe, struck the funnyman in the leg, earning himself a trip to jail on misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct and battery. Englander acknowledged throwing a peel from a banana he had eaten earlier because he took offense to racially insensitive jokes Chappelle made about his companion, police said. Scroll down for video . Not amused: Santa Fe police say a man tossed a banana peel at Dave Chappelle during a show in New Mexico Monday, hitting in the comedian in the leg. Here Chappelle performs last summer . Thrower: Christian Englander, 30, of Santa Fe, was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor disorderly conduct and battery. He told police he was angry at comments Chappelle made about his friend that night . Chappelle was performing a comedy routine at the Lensic theater in Santa Fe when a banana peel struck him . The friend reportedly was drawing in a sketchbook during the show at Lensic theater Monday night when Chappelle noticed and asked the man his name, which he gave as 'Johnny Appleseed,' Santa Fe police spokesperson Andrea Dobyns said. Chappelle then made jokes about the moniker, the police spokeswoman said, 'so that's when Englander got upset.' According to TMZ, the man thought Chappelle's quips were racist, so he decided to throw the peel, which he had in his pocket after consuming a banana and washing it down with a shot of the alcoholic beverage 99 Bananas at a convenience store before the show. Arresting officers said Englander appeared to be intoxicated after event security escorted him outside. Racial attack: Chappelle told police Englander did not seem remorseful, and he believed the banana attack was racially motivated . Englander was in jail Tuesday, and Dobyns said she didn't know whether he has an attorney to speak on his behalf. Chappelle has had his share of run-ins with audience members in the past. Fueled up: Englander said he ate the banana and washed it down with a shot of 99 Bananas liquor before the show . In a 2013 gig in Hartford, Connecticut, Chappelle shut down his act after 10 minutes because of heckling. Known for his sharp commentary on race relations in America, Chappelle has gradually resumed his stand-up career in the past two years, making a long-awaited return after abruptly abandoning a popular Comedy Central show in 2005. Court documents indicate that following his arrest Monday night, Christian Englander 'appeared unapologetic and made several statements that appeared to be racially motivated.’ A criminal complaint cited by the Albuquerque Journal states that while smiling and laughing, Englander said: 'maybe I should have handed you [Chappelle] the banana instead.' Chappelle told police it seemed that his attacker was not remorseful and that the banana toss was 'racially motivated,' according to the complaint. The 41-year-old comedian indicated that he wanted to press charges against Englander. Once Englander was removed from the venue, Chappelle resumed his routine but spent the remainer of his set harping on the fruit fracas. ‘First I'm going to kill him with my comedy then I'm going to kick him in his f***ing face,’ he said, according to an audio recording made by an audience member and shared online. ‘By the way, these are empty threats.’ He later expressed a desire to hurl a tuna casserole in his assailant's face and to choke the life out of him - but noted that he wouldn't do it because it's against the law. The famed comedian took issue with the fact that the fruit hurled at him was not even fresh and marveled at the fact that someone would carry a banana peel in their pocket. ‘Why didn't he throw a good banana at me? Just the brown peel? Where's the rest of it? I am actually offended by the poor quality of the banana. It was brown, man,’ he was quoted as saying by the news blog NewsCastic. But the pugnacious performer said he was not surprised that it happened to him. ‘I wish I could be, “I can't believe this is happening,” but in all honestly, I've been expecting that banana for many years,’ Chappelle told the crowd. ‘I just didn't know tonight was going to be the night.' The former Comedy Central star also used the incident to gently rib the popular comedy duo Key and Peele, who currently have a sketch show on the cable network. ‘Key and Peele probably did that s***,’ he joked, referring to the banana throw. ‘Key and Banana Peel.’ Chappelle is expected to carry on his comedy tour, performing a show in El Paso, Texas, Tuesday night.

"Elena Komleva (pictured) has advertised for a man to get her pregnant . A Russian beauty has advertised for a man to get her pregnant - because she was fed up with her mother nagging her about not having grandchildren. Elena Komleva, from Cheliabinsk in southern Russia, placed the advert on a social media website - and was soon flooded with offers. The 29-year-old toe-nail painting artist described it as a 'contest' adding that her mother would select the winning candidate. Taking to her Vkontakt page - the equivalent of a Facebook profile - she wrote:  'My mother needs grandchildren to give them all the baby clothes she has been collecting. But nobody wants to marry me yet. 'So, if you are young, strong and healthy drop me a line. 'My mother will be in charge of selecting the candidates and announcing the winner. She knows what I need.' She has already been inundated with offers from men, with many posting replies to her advert. Yuri Yuriev, 28, said: 'Hmm, a woman in need - I am here to help.' Kuzma Tretiakov, 25, said: 'I’m young, strong and healthy and ready to go.' But while her Vkontakt friends offered support and congratulations on her idea - with friend Sergey Mironov and others posting 'Happy birthday, all the best and good luck to you' - some were more concerned. Borislav Baranov, 28, said: 'I’d love to help her, but her mother seems a bit of a nightmare.' And Leonid Ponomaryov said: 'What about morals? Can this be right?' Komleva, from Cheliabinsk in southern Russia, placed the advert on a social media website - and was soon flooded with offers . In response Ms Komleva is reported as having said: 'There is nothing for me to be ashamed of. I was in love once, but I was also unhappy. 'I am hoping to find a husband, but if I only find a biological father that’s also ok. At least it will stop my mum going on at me.'

"Woody Allen has been mired in controversy for the past year, following daughter Dylan's accusations that he molested her when she was  7 years old. Now the filmmaker is being hit with even more allegations of misconduct from one of his former leading ladies. Mariel Hemingway was just 16 years old when she starred as Allen's teenage girlfriend in the controversial romantic-comedy 'Manhattan'. May-December: In her new memoir, Mariel Hemingway says Woody Allen asked her to go to Paris with her after filming 'Manhattan' in 1979. She was just 16 years old when the film was shot - to Allen's 43. Above, a still from the film in which Hemingway plays Allen's schoolgirl romance . While the film was considered scandalous at the time, Hemingway has never spoken out against the director and last year even attended the Golden Globes to honor his lifetime achievement award. However, in her new memoir 'Out Came the Sun', she says Allen showed romantic interest in her which made her uncomfortable, according to FOX News. After wrapping filming on the 1979 movie, Hemingway says then 43-year-old Allen flew out to her parent's home in Idaho for a visit, during which he asked her to go to Paris with him. 'Our relationship was platonic, but I started to see that he had a kind of crush on me, though I dismissed it as the kind of thing that seemed to happen any time middle-aged men got around young women,' Hemingway writes. Independent: Hemingway, the granddaughter to literary legend Ernest Hemingway, says she refused Allen's offer when she realized they would not be staying in separate rooms . The teenage granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway told her parents that she 'didn't know what the arrangement was going to be' and 'wasn't sure' if she was going to have her own room. 'Woody hadn't said that. He hadn't even hinted it,' Hemingway remembers. 'But I wanted them to put their foot down. They didn't. They kept lightly encouraging me.' Hemingway recalls waking up in the middle of the night 'with the certain knowledge that I was an idiot'. She then went to Allen's guest room, shook him awake and asked: 'I'm not going to get my room am I?' Controversial: In 1980, Allen started dating Mia Farrow, another leading lady. The couple broke up in 1992 when Farrow found nude pictures of her then 20-year-old adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn in Allen's possession. Allen and Soon-Yi married in 1997 and remain together (pictured above last July) While he fumbled to put on his glasses, Hemingway made up her mind before he could even respond. 'I can't go to Paris with you,' she said. The next morning, Allen ordered a private jet and left the family's ranch. The following year, Allen started dating another one of his actresses - Mia Farrow. The couple stayed together until 1992, when Farrow found nude pictures of her then 20-year-old adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn in Allen's possession. Allen married Soon-Yi five years later and they remain together, with two daughters. In February 2014, Allen's estranged daughter Dylan wrote a scathing essay in the New York Times, claiming he sexually abused her in an attic when she was a child, sometime after his separation from her mother. Allen has fiercely denied the claims.","The actress and granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway played Allen's schoolgirl love interest in the controversial film 'Manhattan'

"The daughter of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov has claimed Vladimir Putin is 'politically' responsible for her father's murder. In an interview in Italy, Zhanna Nemtsova claimed her father was 'a critic of Putin, he fought with Putin, with nobody else', and said she blamed the Russian president for his death. The killing of 55-year-old Mr Nemtsov, who was shot near the Kremlin in late February, has infuriated the opposition, which sees Mr Putin as responsible. Blames Putin: Zhanna Nemtsova, the daughter of murdered opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, has claimed Vladimir Putin is 'politically' responsible for her father's murder . Speaking yesterday, Ms Nemtsova added: 'After his death the opposition is beheaded and everybody is frightened.' Five people have been detained and two charged for the killing, although Mr Nemtsov's colleagues worry that whoever ordered his murder may not be found . The only man to so far confess to the killing has dramatically denied any guilt and claims his confession was forced under torture and threat of death. Zaur Dadayev was said to have admitted to the shooting but he now claims he was told that by confessing, a friend he was with could go free. Suggestion: Ms Nemtsova said her father was 'a critic of Putin and fought with Putin, with nobody else' If he failed to confess he would be killed in a grenade explosion, a fate he alleged another suspect named Bislan Shavanov met in recent days. Dadayev said: 'At the time of the arrest I was with a friend, my former subordinate Ruslan Yusupov. And they said that if I confessed, he would be freed. 'Otherwise the same thing would happen to me as to Shavanov.' The official version is that Shavanov killed himself with a grenade as police came to arrest him. He added he was not guilty and the judge did not allow him to speak, he told Moskovskiy Komsomolets newspaper. Human rights experts who met Dadayev and other suspects in detention found 'traces of torture and beating' on their bodies, it was reported. Zaur Dadayev (pictured) was originally reported to have confessed to the killing, but has now claimed this confession was made under torture and threat of death . Nemtsov was gunned down close to the Kremlin last month as he walked home late at night with his girlfriend . 'We are carefully checking into this,' said chairman of the Moscow Public Monitoring Commission, Anton Tsvetkov. 'There are reasons that lead us to believe Zaur Dadayev confessed under torture,' said Andrei Babushkin, a member of the Kremlin's human rights council. There were 'numerous wounds' on the body of the suspect. Earlier law enforcement sources claimed forensic tests 'give reasons to believe that Dadayev was the man who shot Nemtsov'. However, the source admitted the murder weapon had not been found yet. Nemtsov - a prominent Putin foe - was gunned down close to the Kremlin on 27 February as he walked home late at night with his Ukrainian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya. More startling revelations to be reported today included claims Nemtsov's murder was ordered by a senior security official in Chechnya. The identity of the man - named only Ruslan, and said to be a close relative of top political figures in the region - is known to Vladimir Putin and the FSB, but he has not been detained, reported Novaya Gazeta, Russia's leading investigative newspaper. The Russian president has been told in addition that three other prominent liberal figures are on a chilling Chechen 'hit list'. His body sits in a body-bag as authorities work at the scene of his killing in Moscow last month . They are exiled Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon who was jailed for a decade under Putin but now says he has ambitions to become president; Alexei Venediktov, respected editor of editorially independent Ekho Mosocw radio; and glamorous Ksenia Sobchak, a TV presenter and opposition blogger, daughter of the president's political mentor Anatoly Sobchak, former mayor of St Petersburg. Other media in Russia today named him as Ruslan Geremeev. In sensational claims, the newspaper reported that the man who ordered 55-year-old Nemtsov's murder is a highly decorated major in the same Interior Ministry unit called 'North' in Chechnya in which alleged killer Dadayev served until recently. Novaya Gazeta said it did not name him because of the presumption of innocence, but admitted the alleged mastermind's identity 'is known to dozens, if not hundreds, of members of the FSB and the Investigation Committee'. People walk past flowers left at the site where Nemtsov was killed on the evening of February 27 . Nemtsov was a prominent anti-Putin foe. Pictured is his casket being carried at his funeral . He is said to have been questioned by investigators on Monday, though not detained. His uncle was named as Suleiman Geremeev, a senator for Chechnya in the Russian upper house. Another relative is Russian MP Adam Delimkhanov, a close henchman of powerful Chechen ruler Ramzan Kadryov, a key Putin ally. 'The head of state was informed about the details by the director of the FSB Alexander Bortnikov,' reported Novaya Gazeta, which is part-owned by ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and by Alexander Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent titles and the London Evening Standard. Several reports say the disclosures prevent a major challenge for Putin, because he must allow the prosecution of a key figure from the security services professing total loyalty to him in Chechnya - or snub his Moscow law enforcement cadres who have exposed the murder plot. For some time, there has been a power struggle between those under Kadyrov's command, and those at federal level in Moscow, with claims the Chechens have a free hand to conduct illegal operations. The Kremlin have denied Vladimir Putin has health . For the second time in two days, the Kremlin denied Vladimir Putin has health problems amid claims he has suddenly disappeared from public view and has not been seen since 6 March. His spokesman dismissed as 'spring fever' that the Russian president is ill or that his government had resigned, or a close ally has quit as boss of oil giant Rosneft. Putin's handshake could 'break your hand', he said. The Russian president has been under sustained pressure recently with a sharp dispute with the West over Ukraine, sanctions and low oil prices causing economic misery for Russians, and claims government officials ordered the murder of a key opposition figure. Pusekov implied the 62 year old leader was too busy working behind the scenes to make any public appearances. On Wednesday, Putin cancelled an expected high profile visit to Kazakhstan, with an Astana source saying 'it looks like he has fallen ill'. And several official pictures on the Kremlin website of the strongman at official meetings were claimed to have been taken in advance of when they were posted. The mystery over Putin's whereabouts come amid claims that opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was assassinated on the orders of the Kremlin, and allegations the main suspect was tortured and threatened with death. 'As soon as spring is in the air, then the fever begins,' said his spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissively today. Rumours that close Putin ally and hardliner Igor Sechin had quit were 'dreams' as were whispers of the government resigning. 'We are calm on this fever, and respond to the questions with patience,' Peskov said. A day earlier he had said: 'The president feels fine.' On the Kazakhstan trip postponement when Putin was due to meet Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev and Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, he said: 'We are not giving any explanations as to the reasons. This was the decision of the leaders.' While Putin has been pictured with several regional governors in recent days, there were claims pictures of the meetings were taken on or around 5 March and issued later to make it seem as if the president was working normally. It is claimed that pictures of Putin marking International Woman's Day on March 8 were taken in advance . Pictures of Putin marking International Woman's Day on March 8 were also taken in advance, it is claimed. On 10 March, it was reported that Putin met with Governor of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug Dmitry Kobylkin. However, sources claim the Siberian official was not in the Kremlin on that day. On 11 March, Putin was reported to have met Governor of Karelia Alexander Khudilainen. The local media in Karelia say the session was in fact on 5 March. He was last seen by journalists on March 5 when he met Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, it was reported. Meetings since then were held without journalists present. One blogger quipped: 'To prove that Putin is alive and well, Peskov showed picture from a week ago.' On previous absences, there have been rumours of Putin undergoing plastic surgery treatment. Earlier health alerts over Putin have focused on rumoured back trouble and pancreatic cancer, but no clear evidence has been cited to detract from an action man image he actively cultivates.","Zhanna Nemtsova claimed her father 'fought with Putin and nobody else'

"Pot-smoking country singer Willie Nelson has been accused of stealing a marijuana-inspired song and passing it off as his own. Songwriter Ashley Wilson claims she and her late partner 'Uncle' Mark Reynolds wrote Nelson's Number One hit 'Roll Me Up And Smoke Me When I Die' a quarter of a century ago. And now they want Nelson to give up all his profits from the song, which topped the charts for the 81-year-old country outlaw in 2012, when he sang it along with other famous marijuana users Snoop Dogg, Kris Kristofferson and country star Jamey Johnson. Wilson, 45, has filed a federal lawsuit in her native Georgia, claiming copyright infringement against Nelson, four men listed as the hit's songwriters and a slew of record companies. Lighting up: A well known pothead, Wiilie first recorded Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die in 2012. It topped the charts for the 81-year-old country outlaw in 2012, when he sang it along with other famous marijuana users Snoop Dogg, Kris Kristofferson and country star Jamey Johnson . Songwriter Ashley Wilson claims she and her late partner 'Uncle' Mark Reynolds wrote Nelson's Number One hit a quarter of a century ago. The suit points to versions of the song posted on YouTube. In one,  Reynolds, who died in 2004 aged 44, says he wrote the song for his mother. 'She called and asked me one day, your father and I are filling out some paperwork and she said there's a clause in there, ""if you die before we do."" So I went and thought about this thing and I dealt with it the only way I could and that was in a song."" Wilson, who lives in Woodstock, Georgia, claims she and Reynolds, who sang as a duet called Ashley and Mark, recorded the song on an album released on cassette in 1990. She did not return calls from Daily Mail Online. In the suit, Wilson says Reynolds 'likely' knew John Colgin, one of the four songwriters named in the suit, and listed as having written Nelson's version. She says Colgin lived at the time in Roswell, Georgia, just 14 miles from Reynolds' home in Woodstock. Though the lyrics of the two versions are different, Wilson said they 'contain the same title and dominant line in the chorus…with substantially similar melody, rhythm and cadence, as well as substantially similar lyrical themes.' Ashley Wilson and the estate of Mark Reynolds are suing Willie for copyright infringement . Willie poses after the unveiling of his statue at ACL Live in Austin, Texas. He released the single Roll Me Up on April 20 2012 — a significant day for pot smokers as 420 is slang for cannabis . Nelson's version includes the lines 'Now you won't see no sad and teary eyes when I get my wings and it's my time to fly. Call my friends and tell 'em there's a party, come on by. Now just roll me up and smoke me when I die. The Reynolds/Wilson version lyrics say: 'Now don't you sit around a-weeping, telling tales about how good I was.

"A Florida ex-convict has been arrested and charged with murder and arson in the death of a retired university professor, who had given the suspect and his wife close to $40,000 in financial aid. Dr Thomas Oakland, 75, was initially believed to have died in a house fire, but an autopsy on the retired University of Florida professor found that he'd been bludgeoned and was already dead when fire consumed his Gainesville home Wednesday. Police opened a homicide investigation and began searching for a couple who knew the professor. Late Thursday, the US Marshals Florida Regional Fugitive Task Force apprehended 37-year-old Stephen Underwood Jr. in Jacksonville. Underwood had been released from prison December 22 after convictions for fraud and trafficking in stolen property, according to state records. Arrest: Stephen Underwood Jr (left), 37, has been charged of murder, arson, burglary and grand theft in the death of Dr Thomas Oakland (right), 75, whose body was recovered inside his fire-ravaged home . Inferno: Oakland's body was found by firefighters responding to a call about flames coming from his home in Gainesville, Florida . Underwood, a day laborer who is currently unemployed, is now being held on charges of murder, arson, burglary and grand theft. The suspect and his wife of two years, Sherry Sidell Underwood, 48, had a relationship with Oakland that was ‘financial,’ Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said. Gainesville Fire Rescue got the call at 1.07pm Wednesday about flames coming from Oakland's home at 1921 SW 8th Drive in the Kirkwood subdivision, reported the Gainesville Sun. The man's body was discovered in one of the home's three bedrooms. For years before his death, Oakland had been a ‘Good Samaritan’ who was trying to help Underwood out, police said. Over the year before Underwood went to prison, investigators believe Oakland gave him more than $37,000 in cash. ‘Apparently, Underwood knew Oakland kept cash in the house,’ Tobias said. When Underwood got out of prison, the relationship became a problem for Oakland, police said. The professor contacted police last month to file reports that he'd been defrauded by Underwood. Oakland told officers at the time that he knew Underwood had taken advantage of him, but wanted to help. Beneficiaries: For years before his death, Oakland had been a ‘Good Samaritan’ who was trying to help Underwood (left) and his disabled wife, Sherry Sidell Underwood (right), 48 . Oakland said he ‘just wanted to be a good Christian and help a poor man get back on his feet,’ according to police documents. It wasn't immediately clear how Oakland said he had been defrauded. Police said Underwood's wife, who is disabled, told police that her husband had a large bag of cash she believed he had taken from Oakland. Scholar: Oakland was a prominent professor of education until his retirement in 2010, and a former Fulbright Scholar . ‘She knew he was unemployed and had no funds of his own, and all of a sudden he had a bag of cash,’ Tobias said, adding that the woman is not being charged. Oakland, a former Fulbright Scholar, was a prominent professor of education until his retirement in 2010, and president of the International Foundation for Children's Education, according to the university. He'd also authored or edited 12 book and hundreds of articles. ‘Dr. Oakland was an exemplary world-class scholar in the field of school psychology, and a dedicated teacher, researcher and mentor to his students during his 15 years as a College of Education faculty member,’ said Glenn Good, dean of the school's College of Education. ‘We will continue to be inspired by his extraordinary commitment to the college and his profession, his caring and love for his family, compassion for his students and graduates, and his grace and humor.’ Court records show Underwood Jr. has a long rap sheet dating back to at least 2007. In 2014, he was convicted of swindling, fraud and dealing stolen property. He's also been convicted on drug charges, forgery and grand theft. Jean Crockett, director of the school's College of Education, told the Gainesville Sun that the 75-year-old educator was especially known for working with disabled children and adults both in the US and abroad.","Stephen Underwood Jr, 37, charged of murder, arson, burglary and grand theft in the death of Dr Thomas Oakland .

"No police officers will be disciplined despite failing to properly investigate the systematic rape and abuse of young girls in Rochdale, it was revealed today. Seven Greater Manchester Police officers were served with misconduct notices but after a four year investigation six were given 'management advice' and one was allowed to retire. The Rochdale scandal saw hundreds of vulnerable young girls fall into the hands of Asian grooming gangs because the authorities failed to protect them over at least six years. In 2012 nine Asian men were jailed for a total of 77 years for rape and trafficking after they preyed on girls as young as 13, plying them with drugs, alcohol and money before passing them round the group for sex. No further action: Seven police officers who were served with misconduct notices over the abuse scandal in Rochdale (pictured), will not face disciplinary action . A subsequent report said the girls were allowed to fall into the hands of Pakistani grooming gangs because police and social workers may have been scared of seeming racist. It sparked an investigation conducted by the force's professional standards branch, and supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which today highlights a number of significant failures. Its report, published today, concludes that the officers placed too much emphasis on the credibility of the victims, and not enough on the crime. The seven officers investigated were interviewed about their decision-making, handling of investigations, and victim care. They were the former divisional Chief Supt, John O'Hare, a Superintendent, plus two Det Chief Inspectors, two Detective Inspectors, and one Sergeant. One Detective Inspector was found to have a case to answer for misconduct but retired before the inquiry could be completed. Nine men, including these eight, were jailed for a total of 77 years for rape and trafficking after they preyed on girls as young as 13-years-old . By the summer of 2013 force investigators had identified the Det Insp should attend a formal misconduct hearing but they left the force in January 2014. The investigation - titled Operation Span - exposed flaws across all agencies in response to the challenges associated with child sexual exploitation, including a lack of understanding of the complexity of the issue. Other failures were identified as issues, with information being shared across agencies that used different IT systems, GMP's focus being on addressing serious acquisitive crime, and officers not having the necessary skill set. It also said the 'churn' of staff at Rochdale, particularly in the inspecting ranks, meant that leadership of the issue could not be maintained, and there was little in the way of effective handover. Shame: The abuse of the jailed gang began at two takeaways in the Heywood area of Rochdale, including the Balti House (pictured), which is under new ownership . The investigation identified one detective sergeant who made individual errors in his handling of the investigation, but it found that he had raised concerns about a need for more resources but was not supported by his superiors. Others who were served notices included the former divisional chief superintendent, a superintendent, two detective chief inspectors, and two detective inspectors. They all received management action in respect of their performances. The report was split into two parts, one looking at the handling of the complaints made by two separate children, and the other looking into the wider decision-making by the Rochdale senior leadership . There were signs for many years that men were using vulnerable young girls in Rochdale for sex, but no action was taken. Here we highlight the failures. SOCIAL WORKERS . From the outset, social workers failed to regard the teenage girls being passed around for sex among a gang of Asian men as victims. That was despite more than 100 reports of abuse from the victims, health workers and elsewhere linked to men working in taxi and takeaway businesses dating back to 2004, and involving children as young as ten. Instead the girls were treated as their attackers treated them, 'like prostitutes'. Victims as young as ten were seen as 'making their own choice' and 'engaging in consensual sexual activity'. In one case a parent making a complaint was told his daughter was 'hanging out with a bad crowd'.As a result of this catastrophic  dereliction of duty, information was not systematically passed to the police, and the terrified victims were left at the mercy of a gang of violent sexual predators. POLICE . Just as social workers failed to protect the victims from the rapists preying on them, so the police failed for years to grasp the nettle and launch a serious investigation. As well as reports from social workers, Greater Manchester Police received 44 referrals from the NHS about the abuse. In 2009 one victim, known as 'Suzie', made a detailed complaint about the attacks. Arrests were made but the case was dropped by state prosecutors. It was not until a year later that a full investigation was launched. Police also failed to demand proper bail restrictions on the attackers. Even after the trial, the police refused to acknowledge the racial element of the crimes, saying it was wrong to get 'hung up on race and ethnicity issues'. CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE . An early police investigation in 2009 was passed to prosecutors but astonishingly no action was taken. Instead a senior CPS prosecutor 'refused charge', claiming it was unlikely to lead to a successful trial. That was despite the existence of forensic evidence including DNA swabs from a victim's underwear. It was two years before that decision was overturned. Yesterday's report found prosecutors thought the main victim would be seen by the court as an unreliable witness, and blamed the cost of bringing the case and 'officer workload' for the decision. THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY . Members of the community would  have known about the abuse of white girls being carried out by Pakistani  men but did nothing to stop it. Jack Straw, the former Justice Secretary, said there was 'denial' around the issue. He said: 'These are small communities so people would have a rough idea that there is a group of men who are abusing white girls in this way. That has to be dealt with there, as well as much more effective police and social services action.'","Seven police officers were served with misconduct notices over scandal .

"Extraordinary bugged calls between separatists that suggest flight MH17 was shot down by a Russian-made missile over Ukraine were revealed today by investigators. The intercepted dialogue strongly suggests a Russian military crew was accompanying a BUK missile smuggled into eastern Ukraine shortly before the Boeing 777 was shot out the sky. It also indicates the weapons system was smuggled back over the border to Russia afterwards. The disclosures support an earlier MailOnline story highlighting the use of a Volvo truck to transport the BUK. The revelations came as the Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) probing the Malaysian Airlines crash called for witnesses 'who can tell more about the transport, crew and launch of a BUK rocket in the area in the days before and after the crash,' it said. Their video appeal, carrying images of the BUK weapon system on a flatbed truck and audio recordings of the intercepted telephone conversations, was being aired on television and radio and distributed on websites and social media. Dutch prosecutors released a video appeal for witnesses in eastern Ukraine who may have seen a Russian-made BUK rocket (pictured, above, on a Volvo truck) being fired at Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, saying this was the 'leading scenario' in their  investigation into the disaster last year which killed 298 people on board . The video appeal, carrying images of the BUK weapon system on a flatbed truck and  recordings of bugged telephone conversations, was being aired on television and distributed on websites and social media . All 298 people on board the Malaysia Airlines jet - the majority of them Dutch - died when it was shot down over war-torn eastern Ukraine last year. The call for witnesses confirms that investigators are taking seriously the scenario that the Boeing 777 was shot out of the sky by a Russian-made BUK missile fired from an area of Donetsk region controlled by pro-Moscow separatists. Moscow has strongly denied these allegations. Investigators say it is 'too early to draw conclusions on the disaster', but their appeal for witnesses could not be clearer. It was coupled with the release of an intercepted phone call 'between two separatists on July 17th at 9.08am in which they have discussed the transportation of BUK to Donetsk. 'Apparently, the conversation reveals that the BUK was accompanied by a crew'. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team probing the crash called for witnesses 'who can tell more about the transport, crew and launch of a BUK rocket in the area in the days before and after the crash,' it said . The disclosures support an earlier MailOnline story highlighting the use of a Volvo truck to transport the BUK . The full transcript of the call is as follows: . A - listening to you, Buryatik (probably a nickname suggesting the man can be from Buryatia Republic in Siberia) B - hello! A - yes . B - and where should we unload this beauty? A - which one? this one? B - yes, yes, the one I have brought. I am already in Donetsk. A - Is it what I am thinking about? the one called 'M'? B - yes . A - 'PM'? B - yes, yes, yes. BUK. A - oh, BM, yes, yes, yes. B - BUK . A - I understand . B - BUK, BUK. A - so, so, so, and is it on whatsit, a truck? B - yes, it's on whatsit... it need to be unloaded somewhere in order to hide it. A - is it with a crew? B - yes with a crew. A - no need to hide it anywhere, it will go right there. You understand where to? B - I understand. Well, they need a bit of time to have a look at it. A - who is they? B - hello, hello! A - are you there? Cripes. Wait, wait, Librarian. B - aha. Investigators say it is 'too early to draw conclusions', but their appeal for witnesses could not be clearer . Intercepted phone calls also indicate the missile was smuggled back over the border to Russia afterwards . The appeal from the investigators stated: . 'If you saw this transport in Donetsk or have any information regarding the crew members, or their uniform, please contact us. 'From Donetsk the BUK was transported to Snizhne, passing through Makiivka, Zuhres and Torez. 'The JIT would like to speak with witnesses who have seen this transport or who might have other information that can help the investigation. 'Around midday, the BUK was seen in Snizhne, heading south. The BUK had been unloaded off the Volvo truck and was driving by itself. 'The JIT is looking for witnesses who saw the BUK and the crew on 17 July between 12.00 pm and 4.20 pm . 'At 4.20 pm near Hrabove, the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 crashed which was carrying 298 civilian passengers. 'The JIT is looking for witnesses who have seen any of the following events including transport of the BUK, the launch of the BUK missile, the shooting down of the flight MH17 and those who can identify those who are responsible for this crime. 'Even small pieces of information could assist us in our investigation.' Crash investigator survey the wreckage in July last year. All 298 people on board the Malaysia Airlines jet - the majority of them Dutch - died when it was shot down over war-torn eastern Ukraine last year. Another intercepted call between two separatists which took place on 17 July 2014 at 9.32 pm indicated that the BUK is located at a checkpoint where it was expected and one of the crew members has been left behind. The transcript reads: . A - yes! B - hello, commander. Have you already left, yes? A - me? yes, I have left for my task, you - for yours. B - I got it. are you within that very region or not? A - no, I am not within that region. I am to the other direction. B - (inaudible) - a fighter has got lost there from this one... (inaudible) from this missile launcher... he has f***ed his crew. A - what a launcher? B - from BUK. A - from BUK? B - yes. A - and where is he, f*** him? B - here he is, standing at the checkpoint. A - Take him and bring in here, f***. I'll be waiting for him in Snizhne near the petrol station. B - good. The investigators say 'from the conversation we can conclude that one crew member was forgotten at this checkpoint' and appeal for details of the location of the checkpoint or any information about the missing crew member. 'In the early morning of the 18th of July, around 5 am the Volvo truck transporting the BUK was seen in Lugansk heading in the direction of Krasnodon\Sjeverne. 'Have you seen the transport of this BUK in the morning of July 18th? Please contact the JIT. 'We have recorded and analysed the following intercepted telephone call between two separatists which took place on 18 July at 8am. 'It indicates that missile launching system BUK has left Ukraine and crossed the border to Russia.' Frosty:  Tony Abbott (left), the Prime Minister of Australia, which lost 38 people on MH17, is seen with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been accused of supporting rebels in Ukraine . This third call was transcribed as follows: . B - good morning! A - good morning... Yesterday was , F***, I have nothing to say. B - what's up? A - where is, whatsit... err... yesterday... why did your.... comrade... returned... some incomprehensive movements... what was going on yesterday? you tell me. B - they brought the car till crossroad, left it there, the lads went on themselves. A - well. B - so , the car has gone in the correct direction and arrived successfully. this is it. A - I understand. B - there were strange incoming calls which began suddenly, from 10 persons. A - who are those 10 persons? B - err, some people started calling his phone number, introducing themselves... first one, then second, then third, then forth... he told that he had pissed off... later... then he began to call. A - so? B - He introduced himself. A - so he switched off his phone, F***. and we don't know at all where is the car. B - the car is in Russia. A - and yesterday f***, we don't know, waiting here at night... Twenty minutes later the call resumed. B - yes! A - ... you should take... and come to my place, there is no... car, no one saw it. That one which had gone to meet it, returned back without the car, you know what I mean... of a mess. Where? whom? which way did he bring it? ... disaster, you know. B - and what about Librarian? this is the group of people who transported it . A - well . B - on the lowboy... I have just made a contact with them, they are all in RUssia. they will bring a new vehicle from Russia. A - aha, err.. did he give it to Librarian? B - for sure! A - ok, I understand. 'The JIT would like to speak with witnesses who have seen the whereabouts of the BUK missile system and the Volvo truck at the moment when it crossed Russian-Ukrainian border. 'TO sum up, we are looking for people who saw the BUK system on the 17th or 18th of July 2014 on the route shown here at the territories of Donetsk and Lugansk regions. 'The information in this presentation indicates one of the main scenarios of the MH17 crash the JIT is examining now. THe JIT is putting great effort in finding the truth about the cause of the crash of MH17. 'You can find our contact details on www.jitmh17.com. here you can also upload footage and pictures.'

"Actor Martin Shaw (pictured) believes holding trees allows people to feel an ‘extraordinary energy’ As a child he admits he and his brother ‘ridiculed’ their father for being a tree hugger. But yesterday actor Martin Shaw revealed he believes holding trees allows people to feel an ‘extraordinary energy and force’. The Inspector George Gently star has also blasted rural overdevelopment and fears many areas are in danger of looking like a ‘theme park’. The 70-year-old has become a countryside campaigner and said he is infuriated by inappropriate housing developments and rural areas being ruined by signposts and car parks. He said he learned about the force of nature from his father Frank, who used to place his hands on trees to feel their energy. ‘My love of the countryside was something I got from my father. My brother and I would ridicule him slightly,’ he revealed to Countryside magazine. ‘He would walk past a tree and say, “Oh, can you feel that?” And we would go, “Feel what, Dad?” And he would place his hands on the tree and say that he could feel this extraordinary energy and force coursing up through the tree. My brother and I used to go, “Hmmm, yeah, sure, OK.” But of course he was right. ‘The rural issue that most annoys me is the inappropriate housing development. If people need houses, then absolutely we must have houses, it’s iniquitous that we don’t. However, when those houses are provided, they must be provided with a view to our heritage. ‘The suburbinasation of rural life infuriates and upsets me. You’ll find woodlands where people have found their own ways through, their own walks, for hundreds of years, and suddenly they have gravel paths and signposts and car parks. 'The countryside becomes a theme park rather than something that just is, and of itself.’ He revealed his hobby flying planes has allowed him to witness how the countryside has changed in the modern age. ‘I like to fly old aeroplanes. You really only notice the ravages of the 20th and 21st centuries when you’re close up. If you’re flying over rural areas, you’re really looking at Britain the way it was 100 years ago, or maybe even more,’ he said. The Inspector George Gently star blasted rural overdevelopment and also lamented that his hectic schedule gives him little time to explore the ‘breathtaking’ countryside where the programme is based . But the actor, who has recently been filming a new series of BBC One police drama Inspector George Gently, said his hectic schedule means he has little time to explore the ‘breathtaking’ countryside where the programme is based. He said: ‘Our filming schedule on Inspector George Gently is very intense. A typical day is prob-ably 15 hours. There is very little time to explore the country, but sometimes we are on location and it’s absolutely breathtaking. The Durham countryside has a beautiful atmosphere.’ He also has a second home in an ‘extremely remote’ part of Scotland which he describes as his ‘real retreat’. ‘You can’t even get to it without a four-wheel drive. There’s an absence of mental noise. The re-moteness engenders a sense of calm, the absence of competitiveness,’ he said. Shaw, who has three marriages behind him and had three children with his first wife Jill Allen, has lived in Norfolk for the past two decades. He said: ‘I see wildlife on an almost daily basis. Every morning I come down and there are birds just outside my window on the birdfeeders I put out.’ The 70-year-old has become a countryside campaigner and is infuriated by inappropriate housing developments.

"Fire has destroyed a home owned by the man who is accused of killing a Food Network star and her husband and arson investigators have ruled it suspicious. The double-wide trailer, which is on the property belonging to Robert Jason Owens in Leicester, North Carolina, burned down last Friday. It is about 50 yards from the house where Owens lived, but was not being used as a residence, investigators say. Crews were called to the blaze about 2am. By the time they arrived, it had burned almost entirely to the ground. The trailer burned to the ground about 2am on Friday. It was not being lived in by Robert Jason Owens, who is charged with two murders . Arson investigators have not said what caused the fire, but have ruled it suspicious . Owens has been behind bars since March 16, charged with murdering Cristie Schoen Codd and her husband JT Codd. Mrs Codd had appeared on the reality show 'Food Network Stars' in 2012 . Owens has been behind bars since March 16, when he was arrested for the murders of pregnant Cristie Schoen Codd and her husband Joseph 'JT' Codd. Codd, a caterer who was five months pregnant, was a contestant on season eight of 'Food Network Star' in 2012. Detectives say that Owens, a contractor who did some work on the Codds' home, murdered the Codds and then 'stored and destroyed' their bodies. The sheriff's department revealed on Friday - just hours after the fire - that investigators had found the victims' remains in a wood stove on his property. The remains of Owens' alleged victims were found in a wood stove on his property, according to police. Cristie Codd (right) was five months pregnant when she was murdered . Owens' primary home (pictured) is about 50 yards from the trailer on his property that burned down on Friday . Authorities would not say whether the stove was in the trailer that burned down or in Owens' other home. 'It sure does raise a lot of questions, and it would not be truthful to say that it didn't. But we don't know what we have with that and we continue to work through that and process that scene,' Sheriff Van Duncan told WLOS-TV. Authorities will not say whether they've determined a cause for the fire. A neighbor told the TV station that she fears the fire could mean Owens had an accomplice who is helping him to cover up the crime - even while he sits behind bars awaiting a murder trial.","Double-wide trailer that burned was on property belonging to Robert Jason Owens, though he lived in a different house on the land .

"David Cameron will try to form a second coalition with the Liberal Democrats if he fails to get a majority, a senior Cabinet minister has warned. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted there was ‘no alliance’ between the two coalition parties at the coming election, and said the coalition had made it more difficult for both parties to keep their promises. She stressed that an outright Tory win was still possible - and preferable - but said the Tories would make a new deal with the Lib Dems work. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan suggested the Tories were ready to make a deal with the Lib Dems work . Mrs Morgan told the BBC’s Question Time programme: ‘I think if that’s what the electorate presents us with I am sure we will try and make that work. I work with (Lib Dem schools minister) David Laws in the education department on a day by day basis.’ Her comments are the clearest indication yet that the Tory leadership is laying the groundwork for a second deal with Nick Clegg if, as polls predict, the election produces another hung parliament. The move will prove hugely controversial with some senior Tories, who believe the party should try to go it alone in minority government if it emerges from the election as the largest party at Westminster, rather than accept the inevitable compromises of coalition.. London Mayor Boris Johnson told the Daily Mail last week that Mr Cameron should categorically rule out another deal with the Lib Dems. ‘In my view we should say, “stuff coalition with anyone”, he said. ‘We are there to win, we are there to offer leadership, we are there to be a Conservative government. ‘If we go into this issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party it would be absolutely fatal.’ It raises the prospect of a repeat of the scenes in May 2010 when David Cameron and Nick Clegg entered government together . Tory MP Peter Bone yesterday said Mrs Morgan was wrong to even countenance a second coalition with the Lib Dems. ‘I don’t agree with her – I think we should try with a minority government if we fall short,’ he said. ‘Nobody has said to me, in the thousands of doors I have knocked on, that they want another coalition government.’ But a new poll of MPs conducted by Dods, suggested that almost half of Tory MPs (48 per cent) would prefer to have another coalition with the Lib Dems if the party fails to get a majority. Just 26 per cent said the party should rule out a coalition. Some 17 per cent said they would prefer a deal with Ukip. However, the survey found that just 29 per cent of Lib Dem MPs want to do another deal with the Tories, while 43 per cent would prefer a deal with Labour and 29 per cent would prefer to avoid any coalition at all. London Mayor Boris Johnson last week urged Mr Cameron to categorically rule out another deal with the Lib Dems . The right-wing Spectator magazine reported this week that Mr Cameron has already begun private discussions about forming a second coalition with Mr Clegg. It said it was aware of ‘at least two detailed discussions that Cameron has had on the topic in recent weeks. He said the same in both – no matter what they might hear to the contrary, he does not want to run a minority government.’ However, the annual British Social Attitudes Report found little enthusiasm for another five years of coalition, despite broad acceptance for many of the current Government's reforms. The NatCen survey found backing for the idea of coalition government had slumped to its lowest level for 30 years.","Education Secretary insists a Tory win is still possible - and preferable .

"Orlando’s streets have been paved in purple, and gold, as the city embraces football and its newest sports team. Orlando City face Frank Lampard’s future club New York City in a battle of the MLS debutants on Sunday evening in Florida’s Citrus Bowl stadium. But the night before, the city was gripped with football fever as the club created their own festival downtown. Everything was awash with the purple and gold-trimmed Orland kit. Former Everton midfielder Adrian Heath has guided Orlando City to the MLS after four years of hard work . Sunday's match will take place at Florida's Citrus Bowl, which was a venue at the 1994 USA World Cup . A city has warmly welcomed its newest arrival, coming out in their hoards and spending their hard-earned dollars to don the gear and get behind the team. There was even a band brought in to play live to the thronging masses where a whole street was closed off. At one stage, as an item of clothing was thrown amongst the crowd it caught in a light fixing above. 'That's for the soccer Gods,' the lead singer roared and the audience duly erupted in delight (perhaps not the person who lost their jacket). In a country where American Football, basketball and ice hockey already vie for the nations' attention, he could even be forgiven for calling it 'soccer.' But they might have to start finding a new name for their beloved NFL if football keeps growing over here at this rate. New York City have made their mark off the pitch with stellar signings to impress their fanbase . David Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday for New York City . Brazilian star Kaka will also play in the match on Sunday, for the new MLS franchise Orlando City . Orlando’s main other sports team, basketball’s Orlando Magic, are struggling and in these parts a new rival has waltzed in. The entire city was painted purple leading up to the match; signs, posters and banners everywhere. Americans certainly know how to celebrate a sporting occasion. The pre-match partying went well into the early hours, but they did not let sore heads stand in the way of preparing for the game. The fans were out in force again in the hours leading up to kick-off, the smell of barbecues strong in air around the stadium as they set up marquees and settled in for the long haul. Frank Lampard will join the MLS revolution at New York City in the summer when his loan at Man City ends . Orlando City tweeted this about how Lampard won't be at the game and wrote: 'Sorry, Frank - we're sold out' Lampard and Steven Gerrard are soon to join the league, this summer, but even before then they already have Kaka, once considered the greatest player on the planet, at Orlando City and David Villa at New York City, amongst a growing list of prominent names. Hopefully Saturday night’s celebrations did not keep up the New York City squad staying in a nearby hotel, where just that morning Claudio Reyna, their director of football operations, had sat having a contrastingly quiet and relaxed breakfast with his family. There is a sell-out 63,000-strong stadium to entertain. Kaka - Orlando City SC . The Brazilian won the Ballon d’Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass. Frank Lampard – New York City FC . One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City. Steven Gerrard – LA Galaxy . The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane. David Villa - New York City FC . Villa became New York City’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York’s goals in their debut season. Bradley Wright-Phillips - New York Red Bulls . Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term.","Orlando City take on New York City in their MLS opener on Sunday night .

"Keeping boys and girls apart at school allows them to keep their ‘innocence’ for much longer, the headmaster of Eton has claimed. Tony Little said children today needed ‘pretty graphic’ sex education from just nine years old because of the pressures they encounter day-to-day. But he claimed that children are able to ‘be themselves’ until way into their teens if they are kept apart from the other sex. Eton headmaster Tony Little said children today needed ‘pretty graphic’ sex education from just nine years old because of the pressures of mixed-sex education . Speaking at an education summit in Dubai, Mr Little said: ‘What does strike me is that in a single-sex environment, particularly at the age of 13, 14, 15, there is an opportunity for both boys and girls to be themselves for longer. To be 'boyish' for longer, to be young girls. ‘One of the real challenges we face as parents and particularly in schools, and this has accelerated in the last few years, is the growing apparent sophistication of children at a younger age. ‘The need even at the age of nine now, pretty graphic sex education because of the pressures that are being put on girls particularly, from the age 11 and upwards.’ Eton - the exclusive  boarding school attended by David Cameron, Boris Johnson, Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge - is an all-boys school which costs £30,000-a-year to attend . Tony Little became the first old-Etonian to take over as headmaster of the school in 50 years after being appointed in 2001. Mr Little - who was a pupil at Eton Choir School before moving on to Eton with a bursary - has been outspoken in his criticism of education standards. Last year he said exams had not changed much since Victorian times. He said they oblige students 'to sit alone at their desks in preparation for a world in which, for much of the time, they will need to work collaboratively'. Mr Little also attacked the drive to rank schools, saying: “There is more to education than league tables"". He is set to be replaced as the head of Britain's most famous school by the school's 38-year-old history teacher Simon Henderson. Mr Henderson is believed to be one of the youngest leaders in the 574-year history of the school, founded in 1440 by King Henry VI. Mr Little, who is due to step down this summer as Eton’s headmaster, said it was a ‘sad thing’ that sex education is now needed. After 13 years in the post, Mr Little is due to become chief education officer of the GEMS Education network of schools in Europe, the US and Africa. He told the Global Education and Skills Forum: ‘I guess what I'm saying is in a single sex environment, you can allow innocence to last a little longer.’ The head master claimed single sex schools like his ‘remove some of the pressures’ from children around sex and relationships. He said: ‘There are ways of talking about emotional development and about sexuality with single-gender groups, that oddly, and perhaps perversely, can get you further than in co-ed groups.’ But another headteacher – David Goodhew of the mixed sex private school Latymer Upper School – dismissed the claims. Mr Goodhew, who taught in Eton in the late 1990s, said teaching boys and girls together teaches children to ‘see each other as friends and “real people” rather than fantasy figures from the internet or magazines’. He said: ‘Pupils at co-educational schools spend remarkably little time chasing each other romantically, and quite a lot of time studying hard and excelling in a variety of extra-curricular activities.’ Last month the Commons Education Select Committee said primary school children should be taught about sex and relationships because of new dangers posed by the internet. MPs on the influential committee said sex education should be made a legal requirement in all schools to equip pupils for life in today’s society. In a report, the cross-party group pointed out that children are at a growing risk of harm because of new pressures including sexting, online porn and cyberbullying. They also noted that while many children begin puberty at an early age, some primary schools were only teaching pupils about it at the age of 11. Under the current system, primary schools do not have to provide sex and relationships education (SRE) beyond what is covered in the science curriculum. The select committee’s proposals would mean primary schools across the UK would be legally required to provide sex education to all pupils. While the committee did not specify an age at which sex education should start, it could in theory begin at five under their proposals.","Tony Little said single-sex schools allow pupils to keep their ‘innocence’

"Health experts have accused Coca Cola of ‘health washing’ consumers with the launch of its new ‘lower-calorie’ soft drink as it still contains the full amount of an adult’s recommended daily allowance of sugar. The soft drink giant’s latest product, Coke Life, is partly made from a naturally sweet plant called Stevia, in a bid to target health conscious soft drink lovers. But a 330ml can of Coca Cola Life still has 22g of sugar, equivalent of six teaspoons and 89 calories. When compared to a 330ml can of regular Coca Cola which has 35g of sugar, equivalent of almost 10 teaspoons of sugar and 139 calories, that is 35 per cent less sugar. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults of normal body mass index only eat 25g (six teaspoons) of sugar in total per day. University of Sydney nutritionist Dr Kieron Rooney told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Coke Life should not be considered a healthy option… it should not even have a seat at the table. ‘This is health washing, yes it is less sugar than the original but that is still an excessive amount - it is still a sugar sweetened beverage and is no way part of a healthy life or lifestyle.’ Coca-Cola Life (left) comes in a green can and although it has less sugar than regular Coca-Cola (right) it still contains six teaspoons of sugar . Dr Rooney highlighted research carried out in the eighties where rats were given a sugar solution, a saccharin [artificial sweetener] solution and only drank a certain amount. But when the rats were given both sugar and saccharin mixed together they drank more than they normally would. ‘It’s called a super mix, a little bit of sugar and sweetener drives over consumption… if this translates to the human population then that is fantastic for Coke’s profit line,’ Dr Rooney said. Coke Life has its very own ‘super mix’ of both sugar and Stevia - a type of sweetener. ‘Coke will be pushing more products but we will be doing more detriment to our health,’ Dr Rooney warned. When it comes to the green colour of the Coke Life packet it can give off a ‘healthy vibe’, Dr Rooney said. He noted Coke would have done a great amount of market research before they launched the product. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley launched Coca-Cola Life - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - back in London in September . ‘There would have been some work that went into the association of green with health. I can understand how on some superficial level at least that it is seen as a healthier product. ‘But people should be aware that a sugar sweetened beverage is still an excessive calorie product with no nutritional benefits,’ he said. Dr Rooney explained that ‘liquid calories’ are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food. ‘If you are looking to improve health the very first step is to remove your liquid calories,’ Dr Rooney said. The best drinks to consume are water and milk, he advised. And when it comes to Coke’s claims that they are trying to help battle the obesity epidemic, Dr Rooney said it is ‘disingenuous, duplicitous and highly inappropriate for Coke to frame their products as healthy.’ Dr Rooney said it is 'disingenuous, duplicitous and highly inappropriate' for Coke products to be marketed as healthy . Coca-Cola Life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant Stevia, which has been in Japan as a sweetener for over 30 years . Sugary drinks do not just cause weight gain they rot teeth, increase fat on the liver and fat around the waist, he explained . ‘I think it is deceitful and they are sitting there saying the only health worry is weight, which is absolutely wrong.’ Dr Rooney explained that 'liquid calories' are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food . Professor Amanda Lee of Queensland University of Technology, and former chair of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Dietary Guidelines Working Committee, told the Sydney Morning Herald the launch of Coca Cola Life is an example of ‘greenwashing’. ‘It reminds me of the stage we were up at 30 years ago when manufacturers were making healthy cigarettes. I'm worried, it's trying to make a product that's intrinsically unhealthy, healthy,’ she said. ‘There's a high risk that many consumers could be confused, thinking that it's a low-energy option when it's not.’ The product, which hit Australian shelves on Monday, has more natural ingredients than Diet Coke because it doesn’t use artificial sweeteners like Aspartame. Lisa Winn, Coca-Cola South Pacific Marketing Director, said: ‘Coca-Cola Life truly is another example of us keeping in step with consumer demands. ‘We’re confident that the new product is what consumers have been looking for. We’ve achieved the taste you’d expect from Coca-Cola with 35% reduced sugar and kilojoules, compared to Coca-Cola.’ ‘Coke Life isn’t simply a new product from Coca-Cola – it’s another great choice for people who want a delicious Coca-Cola to fit their lifestyle. There is a Coca-Cola option for everyone,’ she said. It is only the fourth drink to be launched in the Trademark’s 128-year history. Peach flavour Lipton Ice Tea has over eight teaspoons of sugar, while Vitamin Water has seven . V Energy Drinks which promise to give you 'energy' have 13 teaspoons of sugar in them . The new addition to Coke's range of 3,500 beverages, should also not be mistaken for Coke Zero, which is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men who don't like the word 'diet' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic Coca-Cola. Coke Life is roughly inbetween Diet Coke and classic Coca-Cola when it comes to calories – you will still find 27 in a can. However, it has 35 per cent less sugar than classic Coke because it uses the natural plant Stevia and sugar as sweeteners, rather than just sugar. Aspartame is a man-made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages. The safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies. However, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in its 2013 re-evaluation that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure. People with the genetic condition phenylketonuria are however told to avoid it. Coke Zero (left) is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate 'diet' drinks with women. Unlike Diet Coke (right), which is completely sugar free, Coke Life still has sugar . Nutritionist Aloysa Hourigan from Nutrition Australia said that Stevia is not known to have any health risks but that doesn't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink Coke Life. 'Nutrition Australia would still say that while it's safe it's still encouraging people to want to eat sweets. Stevia is the name of the plant from which stevia sweetener (steviol glycoside) is obtained. You can buy stevia in a powdered form as a sugar substitute that you can add to food and beverages at home – or you may find it in icecream, water-based beverages, brewed soft drinks, plain and flavoured soy beverages. It can be used in cooking and baking according to the Stevia Australia website, excepting that it does not caramelise like sugar. It has been used in Japan as the main sweetener for over 30 years and safety reviewed by both FSANZ and many other national food standard agencies in other countries e.g the EFSA and USFDA. FSANZ has concluded that the use of steviol glycosides at proposed levels does not raise any public health and safety concerns. 'The problem with all these artificial drinks is they still have high acidity levels and dental erosion. 'The other thing is there is some research that suggests that cola based colour drinks, whether sweetened naturally or artificially, are potentially impact negatively on insulin resistance meaning you are more likely to gain weight,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is not proven or definite but there is some concern around it. No matter what, the best drink is water and that’s we’d still agree.' If you’re wondering what the need for another low-calorie Coke drink is, the global brand which is worth an estimated $74 billion US dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about artificial sweeteners like Aspartame, one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives. Aspartame is ingested every day by millions of people around the world in more than 6,000 well-known brands of food, drink and medicine. However, it has been the subject of a number of studies that appear to show harmful effects on human health. One study linked diet drinks containing Aspartame to premature births, while another suggested it could cause cancer. However, in December 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed aspartame and confirmed it as safe, so Coca-Cola has continued to use it. Powerade has over eight teaspoons of sugar and Gatorade has nine teaspoons . Coca-Cola Life does not contain Aspartame so may be seen as healthier – but it does contain more sugar than Diet Coke. 'I guess with the other artificial sweeteners there is not a lot of evidence unless they are in very high doses that they are harmful. But because research hasn’t been done checking Stevia it seems to be quiet safe in those respects,’ Ms Hourigan said. Coke Life is meant to taste similar to classic Coca-Cola but some have noted a slightly aniseed taste to the beverage. Rival soft drink brand Pepsi have also brought out a drink that uses Stevia as a sweetener in some markets. They have named it Pepsi Next.","A 330ml can of Coca Cola Life still has 22g of sugar and 89 calories .

"A tribunal hearing has found a midwife failed in her duty of care to a teenage mother who she told to 'keep her legs together' after the young mum suffered a vaginal tear while giving birth. New Zealand's Human Rights Review Tribunal also heard community nurse Natasha Thomson showed up six minutes after the baby was born at her patient's house on January 15, 2012. She did this despite receiving five phone calls in one hour from the mother who described herself to be in 'excruciating pain'. A New Zealand Human Rights Review Tribunal found a midwife did not give appropriate care to a teenage mother after she suffered a vaginal tear while giving birth . At one point, Ms Thomson dismissed the increasingly urgent calls from the woman giving birth, her husband and the womon's mother by saying 'teenage mothers sometimes panic when labour starts,' the tribunal wrote in its judgement. The patient - only known in tribunal documents as 'Ms B' - gave birth to her baby 'on her hands and knees in the bathroom'. Thomson did not bring her scissors to cut the umbilical cord and instead had to use kitchen scissors found by the teenager's partner, Mr B. After examining Ms B's perineum - the area between vagina and anus - Thomson told the mother there was a tear. It was a home birth and the midwife arrived late despite receiving five phone calls in one hour from the mother who described herself to be in 'excruciating pain' The teenage mother gave birth to her baby 'on her hands and knees in the bathroom' She said the tear was not a bad one, referring to it as only a 'tiny tear'. Thomson looked at her patient's perineum again and then advised Ms B to be 'ladylike', and to keep her legs together and change her pads on a regular basis. But tribunal documents say Ms B had to be later admitted to hospital. The midwife also had not told the new parents how to properly care for the wound, which was at risk of infection. Tribunal documents said Ms B only went to hospital weeks later when the midwife should have had her admitted at the time . In the weeks after the pregnancy, Ms B was in so much pain in her perineum that she could barely walk. When Ms B took a step she could feel the tear pull open, and found it very painful when urinating. she told the defendant that she had tried to make a funnel to prevent the urine from touching the tear, and said that she could not bear the pain. Ms B became so desperate she even tied her thighs together with her dressing gown cord so that she would not pull the wound open when she walked. The defendant laughed at Ms B's use of the dressing gown cord, which caused Ms B to feel disparaged. The mother was found to have experienced a second degree vaginal tear that she was successfully treated for at Wairau Hospital . The defendant checked the tear and told Ms B that the tear was 'healing fine'. But Ms B still told the defendant that she was in a lot of pain. At no stage did the defendant refer Ms B to a medical practitioner to assess the perineal tear. Ms B was only finally admitted to hospital weeks later on February 10, 2012, after she went to her GP about an infection on her finger that had spread to her hand and arm. It was then Ms B also asked the doctor to check her perineum. The doctor called an obstetrician to assess her and she was found to have experienced a second degree tear that she was successfully treated for at Wairau Hospital.","Nurse Natasha Thomson showed up six minutes after the baby was born .

"One in three 11-year-olds is still overweight or obese - but an expert has warned that the country’s fat youngsters are now ‘getting fatter’ Britain now has 140,000 ‘super-fat’ children who will need gastric bands as adults if they do not slim down, according to a leading expert. The number of seriously overweight children has soared in recent years as Ministers have failed to tackle the problem, said Professor Paul Gately. Official statistics suggest childhood obesity rates have plateaued in recent years – although one in three 11-year-olds is still overweight or obese. But Prof Gately, who treats obese patients, said the figures disguised the fact that the country’s fat youngsters were now ‘getting fatter’. Speaking at an event to discuss whether people were too worried about childhood obesity, he said the problem was ‘much worse’ than many feared. Overall rates had stabilised, but only because middle-class families had started heeding advice to eat healthily and take more exercise, he said. He added: ‘Unfortunately, those children who are already obese are getting fatter. So more deprived communities are getting more obese.’ He continued: ‘We have 140,000 children in the UK who are so obese that if they were adults they would be immediately eligible for surgery.’ Society had to ‘think very carefully about that’, he told a meeting at the Policy Exchange think-tank in London, because ‘obese children tend to become obese adults’. Under recently published guidelines, adults should be considered for weight-loss surgery if they have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more and ‘very poorly controlled’ type 2 diabetes. A BMI of 30 is equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman weighing 13st 9lb, or a 5ft 11in man of 15st 6lb. Any patient with type 2 diabetes and a BMI over 35 should also be considered for weight-reduction surgery, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Britain now has 140,000 ‘super-fat’ children who will need gastric bands as adults if they do not slim down . Teenagers rarely have fat-loss surgery, with only 60 such operations taking place last year. However, as The Mail on Sunday revealed last month, patients are getting younger, with a 12-year-old boy recently going under the knife. Prof Gately, an exercise and obesity specialist at Leeds Metropolitan University, believes successive governments squandered billions on scattergun attempts to protect all children from obesity – when only some were actually ‘at risk’. Arguing many obese people were victims of circumstance, he claimed the current Government’s policy of emphasising ‘personal responsibility’ over weight led to people feeling blamed, which was counterproductive. rofessor Paul Gately (pictured) says the number of seriously overweight children has soared in recent years as Ministers have failed to tackle the problem . And he accused local councils of spending only minuscule amounts on obesity prevention or on helping those affected, even though the problems ‘dwarfed’ other public health issues that had money lavished on them, such as sexually transmitted infections. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘If we only had a real policy for preventing children from getting fat in the first place, we would not have ridiculous figures like this.’ Mr Fry said he believed more teenagers should undergo fat-loss surgery, adding that gastric bands were proven to help patients lose weight and keep it off. But weight-loss motivator Steve Miller countered: ‘Why should parents expect the taxpayer to pay for their child to go on the operating table, because they have been so irresponsible as to let them get so fat?’ He added: ‘Gastric bands don’t treat the underlying reasons why a child is obese, which could be caused by emotional problems or self-esteem issues.’ Former Tory Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, who also spoke at the Policy Exchange event, said the Government’s health initiatives had helped make food healthier – cutting salt and fat levels, and reducing the nation’s intake by billions of calories a day. And he said it was right to stress personal responsibility because it was important that people realised they could take action to cut their weight.","Britain now has 140,000 'super-fat' children who will need gastric bands .

'There was a time when I was so low and helpless I questioned whether I could go on. 'I was so low I was even hospitalized for 30 days due to malnutrition and depression. 'But now I live and breathe the positivity that Oprah tells us all to channel. 'Thanks to her I am happy, have married my dream man, have put a home over my families heads and am making a living out of making people smile.'

'It is hard to put into words what that feels like.You feel like your entire world has fallen apart. 'I was not close to my family and I felt like I had nowhere to turn. 'One day out of sheer desperation I even sold my wedding ring and used the money to buy a gallon of milk, a loaf of bread and some gas for the car.

A relative in California eventually offered a helping hand to Carol and after moving there, it was then, people began telling her she bore an uncanny resemblance to Oprah. Carol said: 'The first time it happened I laughed it off and said ""How can little old me look like someone as amazing as Oprah?"" 'But then it began to happen more and more. 'And the more I looked in the mirror at myself, the more I began to realize we were so alike it was almost spooky. 'It's not just our faces either, it's our mannerisms, our hands and our lives seemed to mirror each other. 'It was almost as if we were twins, two gloves that were entwined with each other. 'Just like me Oprah had endured a difficult childhood and just like me Oprah struggled with her weight. 'She even seemed to change her hairstyle at exactly the same I would change mine. 'We were living parallel lives and I loved her from the moment I saw her on the screen. 'She is such an amazing woman, who channeled such positivity despite where she came from.' Eventually a friend persuaded Carol to enter a look-alike show on US TV in 2007 and despite not winning, her new career was born. Today Carol is paid to appear as Oprah at anything from 90-year-old birthday parties to corporate events. She makes unpaid appearances at woman's shelters. Carol, who is now married to second husband John, 60, said: 'I'll never forget the day I was paid to appear at a corporate event and surprise the guests by giving away an iPad to ever single one of them. 'I did it exactly like the time when Oprah caused a frenzy by giving everyone in the audience a car. 'I said: ""You get an iPad and you get an iPad and YOU get an iPad"" and the room was jumping. It was so much fun. 'But equally rewarding is the charity appearances I do, when just like Oprah I try to talk to women about channeling positivity and turning your life around. 'Because I am living proof, that dreams do happen, you just have to believe it. 'The more I looked in the mirror at myself, the more I began to realize we were so alike it was almost spooky' 'Some days I just gasp when I look up into the mirror and say 'Well hello Miss Oprah' and laugh to myself' 'I just hope one day I get to meet Oprah so I can tell her face to face just how much she has done for me, without even realizing it.' As she walks, talks and moves her hands everything about Carol exudes Oprah and it is not surprising she cannot even go to the grocery store without people stopping and asking her for her autograph. 'It's hard to go out for a coffee these days as now I have perfected my Oprah look so much, I think half the time I think I am her,' laughs Carol. 'People are always stopping me asking if they can help me with my bags, have my autograph and enquiring how Steadman is and no matter how much I insist I am just a look-a-like they just laugh and say, 'That's what all the celebrities say to have a quiet life.'' Although Carol herself admits she looks so like her idol Oprah that she even shocks herself some mornings when she looks in the mirror. 'I think when you have spent so many hours perfecting her mannerisms, her make-up and her look, then you do start to feel like that person,' tells Carol. 'Some days I just gasp when I look up into the mirror and say 'Well hello Miss Oprah' and laugh to myself.'","Carol Woodle is one of the most sought after celebrity look-a-likes in the business .

Earlier, she had been spotted with husband Mike Tindall with both glued to their smartphones as they arrived for the traditional St Patrick's Thursday at the annual racing event. Tindall, a former rugby player, and Zara were both chatting away on their mobiles although both put their phones away once they got inside and the racing action kicked off. Scroll down for video . Zara Tindall happily posed with fans for some selfies this afternoon as she enjoyed a third day of racing action at Cheltenham . Resplendent in a navy coat with a fur collar and carrying a bag by Irish designer Paul Costelloe Zara smiled for the iPhone camera . The Queen's granddaughter has become a familiar face at Cheltenham this week . The stylish royal ordered four outfits from British designer Paul Costelloe ahead of her favourite week of racing . Zara, 33, has long been a fan of racing and is developing a reputation for training point-to-point racers in her own right, having coached bay gelding Monbeg Dude to a seventh place finish in last year's Grand National. But today, she was happy to take a back seat, smiling and laughing with her husband as they watched jockey Ruby Walsh pilot the hotly tipped Vautour to first place in the opening race of the day, the JLT Novices Chase. The Queen's granddaughter has become a familiar face at Cheltenham this week, having begun it on Tuesday, when she arrived to watch the action in a chic navy coat by Paul Costelloe, from whom she ordered four separate ensembles for the week of racing. Earlier in the day Zara and husband Mike Tindall had been spotted glued to their own smartphones as they arrived at the St Patrick's Day event . Cheerful: Zara and Mike both looked happy to be at the racecourse and smiled as they made their way inside . Ladies' Day saw her return to the races for a second time, although she chose to spend the day with friends rather than join her aunt, the Duchess of Cornwall, in her private box. Despite Zara's chic black and grey checked outfit, it was Camilla who ended up making a splash, after she bumped into glamour model Katie Price in the paddock while presenting jockey Sam Twiston-Davies with his trophy following his win in the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase. Ms Price, 36, was in the paddock with her plasterer husband Kieran Hayler, 27, and her hairdresser when she spied Camilla and promptly sidled up to ask for a photo. Sharing a joke: Later, Zara was spotted laughing happily with friends as she waited for the races to begin . Taking it seriously: Zara is building up a reputation for point-to-point training and last year worked with bay gelding Monbeg Dude .

Unexpected: Yesterday saw the Duchess of Cornwall make headlines after she was accosted in the paddock by glamour model Katie Price . Smile! The model asked for a photo with Camilla, with her daughter, Laura Lopes, also joining the pair for a photo . Having a chat: Camilla also bumped into Riders author Jilly Cooper who partially based cad Rupert Campbell-Black on her ex-husband . Family outing: As well as daughter Laura Lopes, the Duchess was also joined by her son Tom Parker-Bowles for the day . The Duchess, who cheerfully obliged, also bumped into another famous face - the author Jilly Cooper, who famously based her showjumping cad Rupert Campbell-Black on Camilla's ex-husband, Andrew Parker-Bowles. Ms Cooper, who lives in Gloucestershire, is no stranger to the world of racing herself, having immersed herself in it while writing her most recent novel, Jump!, which like all the Rutshire Chronicles, features Campbell-Black. Today, however, Zara, who lives close to the racecourse at Gatcomb Park,  was the only royal in the field and took centre stage while watching the racing with her husband and a group of friends. The presence of the royals notwithstanding, the big highlight of St Patrick's Thursday is the Pertemps Network Final, which will see veteran jockey AP McCoy back in the saddle aboard the hotly tipped Regal Encore. Duchess doppelgangers: Day three of the Cheltenham Festival also attracted more than one Duchess of Cambridge lookalike . Hats you win: Racegoers showed off a wide range of hats, among them headbands, fedoras and feathered cocktail numbers . On trend: A lady arrives in a fashionable graphic print dress while another (right) livens up a classic country coat with pink chinos .

"Lululemon is hoping to boost sales among men with a new genital-friendly range of pants. Lululemon Athletica Inc told Bloomberg on Thursday that its ABC pants - referring to their 'anti-ball crushing' design - have given the company a 16 per cent  sales hike in the men's sector of the business last quarter. The Canada-based company's website describes the pants as 'ABC (anti-ball crushing) engineering gives you and the family jewels room to breathe'. Scroll down for video . Lululemon Athletica were hoping their men's ABC pants - referring to their 'anti-ball crushing' design - would boost sales . The men's pants were described by the company as 'giving you and the family jewels room to breathe' The site goes on: 'A wide paneled gusset and four-way stretch Warpstreme fabric make these pants commute, travel and sweat ready.' The Vancouver-based company made its mark on the sports retail market with yoga clothing . Consumers were divided over the ABCs. One man wrote: 'Despite the waist, the fabric is amazing however the legs were so tight and the fabric so thin. If I wore these out everyone would know what underwear I have on by being able to see the lines, that's how tight the thighs are.' But a happy customer posted: 'I love these pants. I wear them as casual, for work (I am a financial advisor) and I wore them to yoga once just to see how flexible they are and they were excellent. 'They are great as travel pants, very comfortable on the plane or driving the car.' Another added: 'Got the grey initially and was pretty satisfied. I would say there was reduced ball crushing, but they are still pretty snug in the thighs and crotch.' The company, which is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, offers a range of athletic wear for men along with smarter clothing. There are 'sweat, post-sweat and no sweat categories'. The athletic brand, set up by Dennis 'Chip' Wilson in Vancouver in 1998, opened its first men's store in the Soho neighborhood of Manhattan on Black Friday last year. And the company is taking advantage of a boost in sales from men's attire and expanding the ranges in stores. According to the company's 2013 annual report, Lululemon had 211 locations. However despite the launch of the ABC pants, shares in Lululemon slumped almost 6 per cent on Thursday. Even though the company raised its expectations for 2015, Wall Street has been looking for even more and its first-quarter outlook disappointed as well. Lululemon earned $110.9 million, or 78 cents per share, for the period ended February 1. That compares with $109.7 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales at stores open for at least a year climbed 5 per cent in the quarter, but declined 1 per cent for the year. For the year, the Canadian company reported an adjusted profit of $1.89 per share on revenue of $1.8 billion. Shares of Lululemon fell $3.38 to $57.58 before the market had opened. Chip Wilson, the founder of Lululemon Athletica Inc., stepped down from the company board last month. He had resigned as chairman last year after controversy about comments he made about customers' body types. In March 2013, the retailer had to issue a massive recall of its black yoga pants after women discovered they were transparent. The recall, of around 17 per cent of pants sold, had a financial impact on the company.","The innovative design of pants has boosted business for the Canada-based clothing retailer .

"When Lara Kelly started posting pictures on social media to track her weight loss journey, the 21-year-old never thought she would end up as the face of weight loss scams. The corporate receptionist, from Bunbury in Western Australia, had lost 57 kilograms over three years through exercise and carefully planned eating plans. To keep her motivated, Ms Kelly posted photos on her Tumblr and Instagram pages to help others. Scroll down for video . Lara Kelly's pictures started appearing in weight loss advertisements, promoting diet supplements . The ads claims to help people to lose weight by erasing '13 kilos of belly fat in four weeks' 'It's a hard thing, it's a huge task [to lose weight],' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I know for me to see other people who have done this and to achieve these results, it’s very motivating for me. I wanted to share my own experiences. 'For other people, it's good to have someone who's been though it before and ask questions.' So far, her Tumblr blog has attracted about 20,000 followers. Another ad found by Lara Kelly, from Bunbury in Western Australia, which used her photo without permission . The 21-year-old has spent three years, exercising and devising eating plans, to lose a total of 57 kilograms . But her well-documented progress was twisted by online advertisements, who started using photographs of her dramatic transformation without her permission, to promote dieting pills which promised to 'erase 13 kilos of belly fat in four weeks'. It was claimed Ms Kelly had used dieting pills to achieve her new look. She had not been aware of the unauthorised use of her image until friends started tagging her and strangers made contact with her about the drugs she had allegedly used for her weight loss. 'People... asked me what my opinion was of them [the pills]. I had to tell them I'd never used them in my life,' Ms Kelly told Daily Mail Australia. 'When it first started getting messages I was shocked. I was trying to get my friends to report [the ads]. But when you get one taken down, 10 more pop up to take its place.' Ms Kelly started out as 120 kilograms and was a size 18 to 20. She is now a size 8 and weighs 63 kilograms . The photographs used were taken from her Tumblr and Instagram sites, which she used to document her progress to motivate others and herself . Ms Kelly said she had tried to track the people who were taking her photo down but she was unsuccessful. 'It's mainly Facebook pages that post the links to other external sites,' she said. 'I message the pages and report them and they just disappear and then pop up again later, or they just block me.' To help combat her picture being used for scams, Ms Kelly started watermarking her snaps with her Instagram handle. But this did not stop them as it could be cropped out or blurred. Ms Kelly urged people not the believe everything they read on the internet. 'Don't look at the picture and assume someone has taken drugs to lose 20 kilos in two weeks,' she said. 'Everyone wants a quick fix. Weight loss is hard, but it's worth it in the end.' Weight loss scams are described by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Scam Watch as those that 'promise weight loss for little or no effort'. 'The scam may involve an unusual or restrictive diet, ""revolutionary"" exercise or fat-busting devices, or products such as pills, patches, or creams,' the website said. 'Often, attractive people or celebrities are used to sell the products. These may be people with a different body shape and metabolism to you and who use the product in conjunction with an exercise regime and strict diet. 'At best fad diets and products might result in a temporary weight loss in the short term and can be dangerous if followed over a longer period.'","Lara Kelly found out her photos were being used to promote dieting scams .

"A woman who underwent a drastic double mastectomy to reduce her risk of breast cancer was horrified to be told by surgeons she already had the disease. Emma Cunliffe was terrified of contracting the disease and so elected for the surgery ahead of her 31st birthday - the age at which both her mother and grandmother were diagnosed. But she was devastated when doctors revealed they had found cancer in her left breast. Emma Cunliffe, 30, was terrified of contracting breast cancer, after both her mother (pictured)  and grandmother were diagnosed in their early 30s. After having a preventative mastectomy, she was horrified to be told she already had the disease . Mrs Cunliffe, 30, said: 'I went back after the surgery and was told I had a 6cm-long tumour. 'It was a cotton-wool consistency so hadn't been dense enough to show up on previous MRI scans. 'It hit me like a bus, I was in complete shock that this could have happened.' Doctors added that had the grade two cancer been found any later, it would have been too late to treat it. 'If I'd not had the operation, I wouldn't have known about the tumour until it was too late,' said Mrs Cunliffe, from Warrington, Cheshire. 'I felt so lucky and like I had been saved. What if I had left it any longer? 'It scared me that I didn't know it was there.' She added: 'There's no doubt in my mind that the mastectomy saved my life. It's been a whirlwind three months.' The shocking news meant she and her fiance Chris, 26, brought their  wedding forward by 18 months and tied the knot in last November. 'We brought the wedding forwards because I'm proof that you never know what's round the corner,' she said. The civil servant said she felt like a 'ticking time bomb' after being checked for signs of breast cancer from the age of 16. This was due to her mother and grandmother both falling victim to the disease in their early 30s. The devastating news that she had a 6cm-long tumour in her left breast prompted Mrs Cunliffe and her now husband Chris to move their forward by 18 months to November last year (pictured) And Mrs Cunliffe became even more worried about her breast cancer risk when she tested positive for the breast cancer gene. She said: 'I was always thinking about it. It's always been my biggest fear and the closer I got to my 30s, the more worried I got. 'In my head I was thinking if ""I don't have this operation by the time I'm 31, I'm going to get cancer"". 'I had always been assumed as high-risk and they assumed I would have the gene. For the medical people to tell you you're high risk is even more worrying.' For this reason, she had already made the decision to have the mastectomy. 'I didn't want the worry of breast cancer to take over my life,' she said. 'I wanted to have the operation and move on with my life.' 'Now I know that if I hadn't had it things could be so much worse.' Mrs Cunliffe underwent a double mastectomy in October 2014 at Royal Liverpool Hospital. Mrs Cunliffe (pictured left four weeks before her preventative mastectomy) had been worried about her risk of cancer all her life, due to the fact she carried the BRCA gene which increases the risk of disease . Mrs Cunliffe underwent a double mastectomy in October last year at Royal Liverpool Hospital. The procedure involved having her nipples and breast tissue removed and implants inserted beneath her skin . The procedure involved having her nipples and breast tissue removed and implants inserted beneath her skin. Two weeks later, she returned to hospital to have her breasts drained of fluids - only to receive the awful news she had cancer. As a result, she began a 10-day course of radiotherapy in January. She has also started taking hormones to prevent the cancer returning, which she will have to take daily for the rest of her life. While she is still receiving radiotherapy, medics predict she will make a full recovery - and  the couple are hoping to finally start a family of their own. Mrs Cunliffe added: 'I felt like a ticking time bomb waiting for cancer to strike, so as soon as I got the go-ahead to have a preventative op, I went for it. Like Angelina Jolie, who also had a preventative mastectomy and now her ovaries removed, Mrs Cunliffe(with husband Chris) plans to do the same . 'Thank heavens I did - or I wouldn't be here today. Instead, the future is looking positive. I've just got married to the man of my dreams, and I'm on my way to being healthy.' And like Angelina Jolie, who also had a preventative mastectomy and now her ovaries removed, Mrs Cunliffe plans to do the same. She said: 'It's a big decision and it's very brave of Angelina. It's a big thing to do as a woman. 'It's taking away all of her female parts. Your breasts and your ovaries are part of being a woman and they make up your identity. 'But it is removing the risks at the same time and that's the most important thing. 'It's the same as when Angelina had her double mastectomy - by having it done while not suffering from cancer, it's just another operation that she will recover from a lot quicker without all the chemotherapy and side effects that come with it.' She added: 'With the cancer gene, we're 40 per cent more likely to develop ovarian cancer. I will be having my ovaries removed but before I do that I want the chance to have children first. 'It's encouraging to hear of celebrities and big names going through the same things as it makes people who are unaware, aware of it. 'It also gives this type of procedure a more high profile and helps people to understand what we're going through and the reasons for it.' Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at Cancer Research UK, said: 'For women with the BRCA gene fault, having their ovaries removed can significantly reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer. 'It also has an added effect of helping to reduce the chances of getting breast cancer, too. 'However, it is important to remember that only a relatively small proportion of breast and ovarian cancers are caused by one of these gene faults, so only a small number of women will be faced with this difficult choice. 'If you're concerned about a family history of breast and ovarian cancer, you can phone our cancer information nurses on 0808 800 4040.'","Emma Cunliffe has BRCA gene which dramatically increases risk of cancer .

"The People's Liberation Army of China is taking the upcoming Military and Police Sniper World Cup seriously. A group of top snipers have been put under intense training for the past two months for a chance to compete in the competition. Among other tasks, soldiers have been asked to shoot the images of flies hidden among bees and grasshoppers on a target sheet from as far away as 100 metres, according to the People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video . Effort: Chinese army has gathered the best marksmen (pictured) to train for the upcoming Military and Police Sniper World Cup . Precision: Trainees are asked to shoot the images of five flies hidden among five bees and five grasshoppers on a target sheet  from as far as 100 metres away . Determination: Snipers are giving all they can during training as only the top ones can represent China in Hungary for a chance to lift up the World Cup . Meng Qingfeng, one of the coaches for the training, said they have designed the content of the training based on tasks from previous World Cups. Mr Meng said in order to improve the snipers' level of precision, the coaches have asked them to hit five flies on the target within a set time limit. 'The target itself will have not only five flies but also five bees, five grasshoppers and you can only hit five flies to gain the highest scores,' added Mr Meng. Trainees are required to complete a series of other tasks, including hitting targets placed 100 metres away from a moving vehicle, which travels at 30 kilometres per hour, and slicing a bullet in half by shooting at the edge of a knife blade. Each year the trainers will think of new and unusual tests for the snipers .

More task: Soldiers are also asked to slice a bullet in half by shooting the edge of a knife blade as the picture shows . 'There is a huge intensity to the tests, the length of the tests are considerable and the areas to be tested on are varied and the time we have to prepare before the tests are short,' said Han Bin, who is the youngest among the trainees and is hoping to win a place on the team. 'Therefore you must go through each area of the tests in your mind before the test itself,' said Mr Han. The current 13 members in training have been whittled down from an initial 30.

"The man accused of stabbing Sydney man Morgan Huxley more than 20 times has been found guilty of his murder. It took the jury just under three hours to find Daniel Jack Kelsall guilty of indecently assaulting the 31-year-old and murdering him in the early hours of September 8, 2013. Mr Huxley's family and friends let out exclamations when the verdict was handed down. Speaking outside court on Wednesday Mr Huxley's ex-girlfriend Jessica Hall said his 'life had been stolen by a worthless psychopath'. Kelsall remained expressionless in the dock as his mother Lynne and father Mark, who had sat near him throughout the trial, looked on. Scroll down for video . The man accused of stabbing Sydney man Morgan Huxley more than 20 times has been found guilty of his murder . Morgan Huxley (pictured) was fatally stabbed on September 8, 2013 at his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore . Mr Huxley's family and friends let out exclamations when the verdict was handed down . Deirdree Huxley (right), the mother of Morgan Huxley, and ex-girlfriend Jessica Hall, depart the NSW Supreme Court in Sydney on Wednesday . In a statement on behalf of Huxley's family, Ms Hall said her former boyfriend was 'an inspiring, generous and loving young man'. 'Morgan was beginning to make his way in the world,' she said outside court. 'He had hopes and dreams that he will never be able to realise. 'He will never get married and never be able to run around a park with his children. We love you Morgan.' It has also emerged that the killer stalked two other men in Neutral Bay, one just a week after he murdered Mr Huxley in his bedroom. One young man told police that just a week after the murder and just streets away, a man he identified as Kelsall — and wearing the same cook’s uniform — stalked him down Ben Boyd Rd almost to his front door. The young man said he confronted Kelsall, who ran off, according to the Daily Telegraph. Another man also told police he was having a cigarette outside a block of units in Spruson St several months before the murder when a man, who he later identified as Kelsall, jumped out from behind a bush. The ex-girlfriend of Morgan Huxley prepares to read a statement at the court . Deirdree Huxley (right), the mother of Morgan Huxley, and ex-girlfriend Jessica Hall (second left), depart with friends at the NSW Supreme Court in Sydney . Owen Huxley, the brother of Morgan Huxley, leaves the NSW Supreme Court in Sydney on Wednesday . Over the course of two week trial, the jury in the NSW Supreme Court heard how Mr Huxley had been discovered by his flatmate lying in a pool of blood in the doorway of his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore. The crown relied on a string of circumstantial evidence, which crown prosecutor Peter McGrath SC told the jury would leave them to infer only one thing - Kelsall was the killer. The first was CCTV footage which shows an intoxicated and barefoot Mr Huxley leaving the nearby Oaks Hotel around 1.30am with Kelsall breaking into a jog behind him. Kelsall tracked him into his home, indecently assaulted him as he lay on his bed, and then stabbed him at least 20 times, the crown said. His DNA had been found on Mr Huxley's penis and a single print matching his ring finger was on the businessman's bedroom door. Mr Huxley's blood was also found on the shoulder bag Kelsall was carrying that night - which the 22-year-old had tried to clean in an 'amateurish' attempt. But the key to all of this was Kelsall's 2012 confessions that he had intrusive thoughts about killing 'a random' with a knife. The truth, Mr McGrath said, was awful but simple - Kelsall killed Mr Huxley for no reason. Daniel Kelsall (centre) is escorted to a prison transport vehicle on Wednesday . Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore . Mark Kelsall, the father of Daniel Kelsall, at court on Wednesday . 'The truth is simple. It is awful, but it is simple. This man killed Morgan Huxley for no reason,' Peter McGrath SC said yesterday. Looking directly at the jury, the crown prosecutor on Tuesday detailed point by point the aspects of the case against the 22-year-old, that, he said, would leave them to infer only one thing. 'This young man Daniel Jack Kelsall in the early hours of September 8, 2013, indecently assaulted Morgan Huxley and then stabbed him to death in his bedroom,' he said. Urging the jury not to be distracted by 'red herrings', Mr McGrath said the crown case against the former junior chef was straight forward and added up. It was not Kelsall, he said, that was in the wrong place at the wrong time but Mr Huxley. 'Chillingly he just happens to be someone who has expressed intrusive, recurring and persistent thoughts about killing someone with a knife on the way home from work. A total stranger. Some random.' Jessica Hall (middle) - the ex-girlfriend of Morgan Huxley - gave evidence at Daniel Jack Kelsall's murder trial in Sydney last week . Rebecca Prins, who was dating Morgan Huxley in the months before his death, is pictured leaving the NSW Supreme Court after giving evidence . But Kelsall had a different story. Taking the stand, Kelsall quietly described how he had struck up a spontaneous conversation with Mr Huxley while the pair were walking home. Kelsall, who pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore. He said Mr Huxley was smiling during the friendly chat but became more serious as he started talking about how he had had a 'stressful week'. 'He said he had some problems with work,' Kelsall said. 'I said something like, 'Do you want to talk about it?'. 'He seemed a little hesitant about it and then he said, 'Yeah, I could do with someone to talk to'.' Mr Huxley then invited him to his apartment, Kelsall told the jury. During the sexual encounter that followed, an intruder or intruders burst in and assaulted the pair, causing him to flee. He then wove a string of lies in a bid to 'disassociate' himself from an event which had terrified him. With his shoes still on, Kelsall said Mr Huxley lay down on his bed. Kelsall told the court he sat between Mr Huxley's legs and began fondling his penis. 'Then something hit me in the side of the head. It really hurt,' Kelsall said. 'I kind of looked up and there was another person in the room. I got up and ran. 'I knew there was at least one (person there). It could have been more.' He told the court he didn't tell police because he was afraid of having anything to do with the murder. 'I want to make amends and tell the truth for a terrible lie I have told and I want them (the jury) to understand my side of the story,' Kelsall said. Mark Kelsall gave evidence last week at the trial of his son Daniel who is accused of killing Morgan Huxley in 2013 in the victim's Sydney apartment . Paramedics Mark Lenehan and David Rigby, who were the first responders to the home of murder victim Morgan Huxley, were pictured arriving at the NSW Supreme Court last week . Citing personal accounts of Kelsall as a caring and bookish boy, his barrister Christopher Watson reminded the jury how the junior chef had left liquorice treats out for his mother on the night of the murder. 'It doesn't sit with a calculated killer,' Mr Watson had said. Mr Huxley's family who all wore yellow roses - signifying his favourite colour - thanked the crown, the jury and the detectives for their dedication to justice. Kelsall's parents said nothing when they left the court. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Morgan Huxley, 31, was fatally stabbed in his Sydney apartment in 2013 .

"A woman found her fiancé on a Facebook selling page after he jokingly offered himself up for sale. Beckie Bennett, 43, was browsing her local buy and sell Facebook group when an unusual offer caught her eye - a local man had advertised himself as 'house trained' and up for sale. Richard Yardley, 38, had written the post as a joke. But when Beckie commented to check out the goods on offer, he asked her on a date. Beckie Bennett and Richard Yardley met after Richard jokingly advertised himself on a buy and sell Facebook page and Beckie commented on his picture. The pair are now engaged . Following their unusual introduction, the couple are now engaged after Richard proposed, and mother-of-three Beckie says she has bagged herself the best bargain ever - the man of her dreams. She said: 'We're going to tie the knot next August, and it's all thanks to that Facebook page. Richard is the best thing I've ever won on the buy, sell and swap page.' In May 2013, Beckie, of Harbury, near Leamington Spa, logged on to Facebook to search for furniture for her son's new flat. Cheeky blonde Richard had jokingly posted a picture of himself on to the page with the caption: 'man for sale - free to a good home.' Beckie said: 'I saw the picture of Richard with his glasses on and I decided to play along. 'I commented to check out Richard's credentials. It's the first rule of Facebook shopping - make sure what you're buying is up to scratch. ''Do you clean, wash and drive?' I asked. Within seconds he'd replied, 'all of the above.'' From the moment they met Beckie says she and Richard were inseparable, he has now proposed and they plan to get married later this year . Beckie and Richard enjoy a trip with two of her children Daniel 15 (left) and Phoebe, seven (centre) After the exchange Beckie was surprised to see that Richard had deleted the post from the Facebook page. Beckie, who is mother to Ashley, 23, Daniel, 15, and Phoebe, seven, said: 'At first I thought I might have offended him, I was only trying to tease him.' Moments later her notification panel pinged and Richard had sent her her a message. The message read: 'How about this for spontaneity - lets meet for a drink.' The pair met up at a pub the next night and immediately hit it off. Beckie said: 'When I met him I thought he seemed really sweet. It was a brilliant first date. I arrived and like a gentleman he was already waiting outside with a drink for me. 'We laughed all night long. It was a whirlwind. From that moment on we were inseparable.' Richard proposed to Beckie with a ring which he hid in the glove compartment of his car . Beckie posted on the buy and sell wall to tell the rest of the users that she and Richard were engaged . Two months into the relationship another visitor to the site asked what had happened to the man who had advertised himself. Beckie replied, announcing: 'Sorry girls, you know the rules.. I commented first, so first dibs!' Richard popped the question by hiding the ring in his car and asking Beckie to fetch something out of his glove compartment. She said: 'He asked me to go fetch something from the car.. I went out thinking it would be some shopping. 'I ran back inside with the ring shouting 'yes' over and over again. He didn't even have time to ask the question.' The couple plan on getting married in August this year. Beckie wrote on the Facebook page recently to let everyone know that they were getting married. She said: 'I never in a million years thought I would bag a husband from a Facebook page. He is such a romantic but he's a joker as well. The way we got together makes everyone laugh.' This is Beckie's profile picture from Facebook.

"A self-driving car is gearing up for  a 3,500-mile cross-country road trip from San Francisco to New York that begins next week. A person will always be behind the wheel of the autonomous car, developed by Delphi Automotive, in order to take control if there is a situation the vehicle cannot handle on its own. The car will begin its journey on March 22 so that it can reach New York in time for the International Auto Show. Scroll down for video . A self-driving car developed by Delphi Automotive is preparing for a 3,500-mile cross-country road trip next week that will take it from San Francisco to New York . Delphi, a major Michigan-based auto supplier, is planning for the car to drive eight hours a day for eight days. The autonomous vehicle will mainly stick to the highways, where it will be able to pass slower cars and maintain a safe distance from other automobiles all on its own. Delphi CTO Jeff Owens told WIRED the road trip will be the 'ultimate test' for the vehicle, as it will be exposed to a 'range of driving conditions' as well as various types of weather. It's design is based on a 2014 Audi SQ5. According to Delphi officials, the road trip will be the longest automated drive ever attempted in North America. In 2010 an autonomous van created by Italian company VisLab completed an 8,000-mile journey from Europe to Shanghai for three months. Unlike Google's driverless car (pictured), Dephi's vehicle senors are tucked in the car's front, rear and sides and thus cannot be seen. Although it will be the Delphi car's longest journey, it won't be its first. The Delphi vehicle has driven around the company's Silicon Valley office and has already completed a trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles. But the car really earned its stripes when, during a demonstration at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in January, it braked by itself as two drunk men stumbled into the street in front of it. Delphi says the vehicle is capable of making complex decisions, like stopping and then proceeding at a four-way stop, merging onto the highway or maneuvering around a bicyclist or a trash can. When the car wants the driver to resume control, it uses a verbal warning and flashes lights on the dashboard. Although most experts say a true driverless vehicle is at least a decade away, Delphi's autonomous automobile is helping the technology look more like a regular car. Unlike other driverless cars developed by Google and Honda, the lidar sensors on Dephi's vehicle are tucked in the car's front, rear and sides and thus cannot be seen. The car also has cameras throughout, including one that watches the driver. Because lidar systems can cost around $70,000 apiece, they drive up the price of the autonomous prototypes. But Delphi engineer Doug Welk said one of the reasons for the road trip is to help decide what combination of sensors is best suited for the car, which will ultimately help lower costs. Delphi estimates it will cost around $5,000 to make a vehicle almost fully autonomous by 2019. Delphi CTO Jeff Owens said the road trip would be the 'ultimate test' for the autonomous vehicle, as it would be exposed to a 'range of driving conditions' as well as various types of weather .","The Delphi Automotive car will drive eight hours a day for eight days .

"Passengers and crew faced mid-air panic on board an Air Europa charter flight after several travellers fainted while en route to Tel Aviv from Barcelona, according to reports. After landing at Ben Gurion Airport this morning passengers told Israeli media that flight attendants were 'hysterical', there was a strong smell of 'gas' in the cabin during the four-hour journey, and 10 people lost consciousness. One passenger told Israeli news website Ynet: ‘They did not let people get up in the bathroom because they were afraid more people would faint.’ Passengers told Israeli media that 10 people fainted during an Air Europa flight from Barcelona to Tel Aviv . In a statement, an Air Europa spokesperson said passengers were feeling dizzy, but did not faint, after noticing a smell that was believed to be kerosene, which powers the jet's engines. The spokesperson said: 'Around 6 people had temporary indisposition this morning travelling from Barcelona to Tel Aviv on flight Air Europa UX433. 'All of them have recovered quickly by drinking a cola drink. All passengers left the aircraft on their own at destination.' Almost 200 passengers and crew were on board the Boeing 737, leased from a company called Flying Carpet, when the situation unfolded. A passenger named Hilla told Ynet that people on board smelled 'gas' after the pilot started the engines while preparing for take-off in Barcelona. She said she complained to cabin crew but was told that everything was 'OK' and not to worry. An hour later, passengers began to lose consciousness, causing people on board to panic, she claimed. Over the plane’s tannoy a flight attendant reportedly asked if there was a doctor on board to assess the passengers. An Air Europa passenger said people splashed water on her to wake her up after she fainted (file photo) One woman who fainted regained consciousness after water was poured on her, but said she soon lost consciousness a second time after feeling dizzy. She told Ynet that she began to feel weak after the person sitting next to her adjusted the air conditioning control above their seat. The woman said: ‘[They] woke me up with water, and after a few minutes I passed out again. 'Stewards were under pressure … and [would] not even let us go to the bathroom.’ The Air Europa spokesperson said there is 'no gas of any type' on the new generation of Boeing 737 aircraft, so the smell perceived by some passengers came from jet fuel. The spokesperson said: ‘The smell of kerosene that some people perceived during flight is normal when the engines are started with headwind, but after short period of time that smell is always removed by the air conditioning system.’ The spokesperson said no emergency was declared and the flight landed as scheduled. An official from Israel's Ministry of Transport said Spanish authorities are investigating. A spokesman for Israel Airports Authority told MailOnline Travel that he was not made aware of any incident on board the plane. He said the flight crew did not say anything about ill passengers while communicating with air traffic controllers. Air Europa is Spain’s third largest airline, with its headquarters located in Mallorca.","Passengers told Israeli media that 10 people fainted during the flight .

"If you’re a woman in the US and you want the best quality of life, Minnesota is the place to be, according to a new study. It came top of the pile in a study of all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, that looked at over a dozen factors to establish the best and worse for women to live in. To coincide with Women’s History Month, WalletHub looked at, among other things, how much women in America’s states earned, health care standards and employment and poverty levels. Scroll down for video . After Minnesota it found that the next best states to live in are Massachusetts, Vermont, Maryland and New Hampshire. South Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas came bottom of the pile. Number one for women’s health care is Vermont and number one for economic social and well-being is Maryland. The best place for a woman to earn big bucks is the District of Columbia, according to the study, and the state with the lowest unemployment rate for women is North Dakota, with Nevada having the highest number of jobless women. New Hampshire scored very well when the researchers analysed education levels, with the state having the lowest high school dropout rate in the country. Arizona was found to have the highest dropout rate. If you’re a woman in the US and you want the best quality of life, Minnesota (pictured) is the place to be, according to a new study . For a long life, it seems that President Obama’s birthplace of Hawaii is the place to be – it has the highest Life expectancy at birth, with Mississippi registering the lowest. WalletHub said that it drew its conclusions after looking at data from sources including the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Educational Statistics. It said: ‘Much work remains to be done in the name of social progress. In some states, women continue to fall behind their male counterparts in various measures. For instance, women represent nearly two-thirds of all minimum-wage workers in the U.S. And in the 22 states that have refused to expand their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, women comprise the majority of poor uninsured adults.’","Minnesota came top of the pile in study that looked at over a dozen factors .

"Stores are set to cut back on Black Friday discounts this year to avoid another ‘delivery tsunami’. The idea of Black Friday has been imported from America, where retailers offer big discounts to kick start the Christmas shopping season. However, it proved a disaster in Britain last year with long queues and violent scenes which saw the police criticising supermarkets for failing to put in place proper security. The web stores trade body, IMRG, has warned retailers that they will have to fundamentally rethink how they handle Black Friday this year after a catastrophe in 2014 . At the same time, many online stores were simply unable to cope with the rush of orders with the result that a huge delivery backlog was created. Many retailers were also disappointed to find the event merely brought forward sales that would have happened later in December, rather than generating any extra business. The web stores trade body, IMRG, has warned retailers that they will have to fundamentally rethink how they handle Black Friday this year. Significantly, it said: ‘Black Friday can be very profitable for retailers who get it right, but discount rates will need to be rationalised and panic-discounting avoided.’ It suggests stores might want to spread the discounts and promotion over a longer period, perhaps a weekend or week, in order to avoid the spike in orders. Firms should also ensure they have sufficient couriers to cope and warn customers that deliveries may take longer than normal, or set up alternative click and collect services. Scenes of violence: Cutomers fought tooth and nail to make the most of discount deals on black Friday. The scale of the event greatly exceeded everyone’s expectations . For many the scenes of chaos didn't pay off. Some retailers were disappointed to find the event merely brought forward sales that would have happened later in December, rather than generating any extra business . The IMRG said: ‘The scale of Black Friday 2014 greatly exceeded everyone’s expectations, which meant a large number of online orders were compressed into a far shorter period of time than anticipated – triggering an online retail ‘delivery tsunami’. ‘This heavily impacted carrier and retailer fulfilment operations and normal activity suffered for days afterwards.’ Andrew Starkey, head of e-logistics at IMRG, said: ‘The huge surge in demand on Black Friday 2014 was unprecedented and caught everyone in the industry by surprise. Fevered and bullish behaviour in retail outlets saw the police criticising supermarkets for failing to put in place proper security . ‘The exact form of it may evolve in 2015, but at least this time we have a precedent and time to develop strategies to ensure the Christmas peak runs as efficiently as possible. ‘It’s fair to say that Black Friday splits opinion, but the impact of it is so vast that it affects all retailers whether they run campaigns or not. ‘The key points for industry to address are around how to smooth out the spike – even spreading it over a few days would make a massive difference to fulfilment operations – and managing expectation so that customers receive accurate and up-to-date information about the progress of their orders.’ Firms should also ensure they have sufficient couriers to cope and warn customers that deliveries may take longer than normal, or set up alternative click and collect services, the IMRG said.","Shops cut back US retail event to avoid deliveries overload and confusion .

"Jeremy Clarkson's future at the BBC is to be decided next week when a report into a 'fracas' with a producer is handed to the director-general. Clarkson was suspended after allegedly punching producer Oisin Tymon during a row after filming over a hot meal at a Yorkshire hotel. The top-rating show was pulled off air while an inquiry was launched. BBC bosses have today said the report will be handed over to the director-general next week. The BBC could have kept Top Gear on air but James May and Richard Hammond refused to go on without their co-host Jeremy Clarkson, it has been revealed . Clarkson (pictured arriving home today) stayed silent today when asked how he felt about a BBC executive allegedly comparing him to Jimmy Savile . The BBC has postponed the remaining episodes of Top Gear following the incident - a move which has seen it lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints . Asked how he felt about the Savile comparisons as he pulled into his driveway, the suspended Top Gear presenter rolled his eyes . The corporation reportedly put forward proposals for May and Hammond to continue to present live sections of the show, which would be combined with pre-recorded parts featuring Clarkson, but the two co-hosts refused. An executive from the corporation told The Sun that 'the whole thing had been a nightmare'. Clarkson and producer Mr Tymon have both now talked to an internal inquiry into the Top Gear fracas. Senior BBC executive Ken MacQuarrie has been tasked with sorting out what happened during the incident, but a date for the conclusion of the inquiry is not yet known. But James May scoffed at suggestions he and Richard Hammond were offered the opportunity to host the show without their under-fire colleague Jeremy Clarkson. Reports suggested both had rejected the offer to host Top Gear without their suspended co-host. However, speaking briefly from his west London home today, Mr May said he had not spoken to anybody at the BBC about it, so he hasn't had the opportunity to refuse to do it. He said: 'It's not true. No-one has ever asked me if I was going to do it, there was never any suggestion that we were going to do it. So I've never had an opportunity to refuse to do it. 'I haven't spoke to anybody about it, it's completely new to me - I don't know where it's come from.' Asked if he had spoke to Mr Hammond about hosting the show without Clarkson he said: 'No. But I definitely wasn't offered the opportunity, that's all I really want to say for now.' May made light of the scenario again this morning on Twitter saying 'Once I've done the plumbing, I'm going to fire up Little Honda to see if Norman Tebbit's 'on yer bike' philosophy works. #StillUnemployed.' Clarkson stayed silent today when asked how he felt about a BBC executive allegedly comparing him to Jimmy Savile. Asked how he felt about the Savile comparisons as he pulled into his driveway, the suspended Top Gear presenter rolled his eyes. The BBC has postponed the remaining episodes of Top Gear following the incident  - a move which has seen it lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints. The top-rating show was pulled off air while an inquiry was launched. BBC bosses have today said the report will be handed over to director-general Tony Hall next week . Clarkson was suspended after allegedly punching producer Oisin Tymon during a row - which took place after filming - over a hot meal at a hotel. The top-rating show was pulled off air while an inquiry was launched . Sunday night's planned episode was replaced by a Red Arrows documentary which pulled in just one million viewers - compared to the five million who regularly tune in for the popular motoring show. Meanwhile, a petition to Bring Back Clarkson has attracted more than 960,000 supporters. Another petition calling on the BBC to hire Alan Partridge, the fictional broadcaster played by Steve Coogan, as the new presenter of Top Gear has also been launched, with almost 20,000 signatures. A BBC spokesman refused to comment on any developments, saying: 'As we said last week we have an investigation ongoing and we won't comment further until that is concluded.' A petition to Bring Back Clarkson (pictured in his black Mercedes today) has attracted more than 960,000 supporters . Blonde events organiser Phillipa Sage was photographed driving away from his flat in  west London today . Clarkson was accused of having an affair with her in 2011, and was pictured kissing her on holiday in Greece in 2013 . Spokesmen for Tymon and Clarkson also declined to comment. On Tuesday, the BBC Trust ruled that Clarkson was not being racist when he used the word 'pikey' on Top Gear - a decision which has sparked condemnation from the Traveller Movement. The presenter put up a placard with the words Pikey's Peak on the BBC2 series in February last year. But the Trust's Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) concluded that the word had been used to mean 'cheap', rather than as a term of racist or ethnic abuse. A spokesman for the Traveller Movement rejected the decision, saying: 'We are horrified by the BBC's green lighting of the use of the word 'pikey' by the Top Gear presenters.' Jeremy Clarkson (left), who is currently suspended, and producer Oisin Tymon (right) have both now talked to an inquiry over the Top Gear fracas . Clarkson raised more eyebrows this week when it emerged that in his column in Top Gear magazine, he discussed immigrant taxi drivers in London, saying that their cars smell 'faintly of lavender oil and sick'. The presenter is still scheduled to appear alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at four live Top Gear shows in Norway on March 27 and 28 and a decision on whether to go ahead is expected soon. Outspoken Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has been involved in a string of controversies. Most recently, the BBC Trust ruled that Clarkson was not being racist when he used the word 'pikey' on Top Gear - a decision which has sparked condemnation from the Traveller Movement. The presenter put up a placard with the words Pikey's Peak on the BBC2 series in February last year. He and the Top Gear team were chased out of Argentina after angry locals reacted with fury to Clarkson's number plate containing an apparent reference to the Falklands War. The H982 FKL plate  was seen locally as a veiled reference to the 1982 conflict. However, the Top Gear denied their use of it was a deliberate reference to the war, and claimed it had simply been a coincidence. In July, Ofcom ruled Clarkson deliberately used racist language by referring to an Asian man as a 'slope' during a Burma special. The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC in 2012 about a special in which Clarkson travelled round India in a Jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot. Clarkson was also reported to have referred to the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' in 2009. And the year before, the BBC received more than 500 complaints after he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. Clarkson also made a mock Nazi salute while talking about a Mini design that might be 'quintessentially German' and received flak after describing those who jump in front of trains as 'Johnny Suicides'. All three men's contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs, which could render any disciplinary hearings redundant. Clarkson is also expected to record an episode of the BBC's top-rating satire show Have I Got News For You in May. Meanwhile, fellow Top Gear hosts May and Hammond took to Twitter to vent their frustration of being unemployed today. May, 52, tweeted this morning: 'Three light bulbs in our house need replacing. I'm doing it today. #StillUnemployed.' He later continued to make jokes that may have alluded to the fact that the show he hosts alongside Clarkson and Richard Hammond has been put on hold pending an inquiry into the 'fracas'. He tweeted: 'Great news! We also need some new hoover bags. I can spin that out for an hour or two,' followed by a Haiku about his boredom. The motorbike enthusiast, who earlier this week described his co host as a 'knob', wrote: 'Life, once so dazzling Sinks into a grey fog of Not-done-it-yourself'. He continued to make light of the amount of free time on his hands, writing: 'Vegetables peel more easily if you wet them, yes. But why? #Unemployed.' 'Seriously, if you really are unemployed, good luck to you. It's not funny in reality.' Then with a picture of the Ferrari badge he tweeted: 'Oh sod it. I'm going for a 'spin.'' He also made what could be interpreted as dark hints about the future of the show earlier in the week, saying: 'Last night, at precisely the moment Top Gear was due to start, the headlights on my car packed up. Not sure where I'm going with this.' Richard Hammond also joined in with the dark hints today, tweeting a picture of a dog alongside a poem. He added: 'Not trying to be cryptic, just enjoying a gorgeous morning. Off..' Jeremy Clarkson, 54, has not been active on Twitter for the past few days, but did change his profile last week to 'I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show, Top Gear.'","Clarkson was suspended after allegedly punching producer Oisin Tymon .

"A Tennessee waitress found herself wiping away tears on Sunday after a kindly couple left her a big tip on their little check. But it wasn't just the $36 that had 25-year-old Claire Hudson crying. Along with the tip, the couple left a note explaining their generosity. 'I would've liked to have caught them and said 'Hey this is awesome!,'' Hudson told ABC News. 'They did it anonymously and it was really sweet.' Touched: Spring Hill, Tennessee waitress Claire Hudson broke down in tears after a patron on Sunday left her a $36 tip in honor of his late brother's 36th birthday and favorite meal . In the note on the credit card receipt, the patron wrote: . 'Today is my brother's b-day. He would have been 36 today. Every year I go eat his favorite meal (hot dogs) and tip the waitress his age. Happy B-day Wes.' Hudson said the check in total wasn't much more than $30 when the couple settled up at Mac's Grub Shak in Spring Hill. 'It was actually a really slow day,' Hudson told ABC. I was in tears when I read [the note]...I had to go in the back of the restaurant and compose myself before I went out to my other tables.' A man left a waitress at Mac's Grub Shak in Spring Hill, Tennessee, a $36 tip in honor of his dead brother . In addition to Coney Island Dogs, the man ordered two beers and a spicy Dragon's Breath burger at Mac's . According to an enhanced version of the picture, the man also ordered two beers and a spicy burger to accompany his special Coney Island Dogs. In addition to the two pork and beef dogs, which came topped with diced onions, chili, and mustard, the man had a Goose Island IPA, a Country Boy beer and a Dragon's Breath burger. The Dragon's Breath is a half pound of premium Black Angus beef, seasoned with a special spicy blend. It comes topped with Jack cheese, crispy fried jalapenos, Sriracha mayo, and applewood smoked bacon. His bill came to $29.40, including tax. Mac's is operated by a father and son team who also own a catering company. Michael McCray, the son, told Daily Mail Online that he lost his brother as well and that his birthday is coming up soon. He said: 'The server the tip was written to has worked for me for several months. 'On Sunday afternoon she came to my office crying and of course I was taken by surprise.

"A 15-year-old boy fatally stabbed a 52-year-old man in the heart after he accidentally spilled coffee on the teenager while leaving a McDonald's, according to authorities. The teen, who has not been named because he is a juvenile, and 22-year-old James McLamb have been charged in the death. Police are seeking a third suspect but say they know his identity. The group was near a McDonald's in Stamford, Connecticut last Wednesday when Antonio Muralles left the fast-food restaurant with a cup of coffee and accidentally bumped into the boy. 'Words were exchanged and then without warning, he was viciously attacked and stabbed through the heart - a very heinous, tragic incident,' Captain Richard Conklin told the Stamford Advocate. Scroll down for video . Accused: James McLamb, 22, has been charged in the death of a 52-year-old man who was stabbed to death in Stamford, Connecticut last week. McLamb's 15-year-old friend allegedly carried out the stabbing . Police said Muralles was also slapped and beaten with a stick. Lieutenant Deidrich Hohn said that the juvenile was responsible for the stabbing, while McLamb assaulted the man,Fox CT reported. Muralles collapsed on a street corner around 10.15pm and was seen by emergency responders who happened to be passing. He was rushed to hospital but died several hours later. Police said information from a narcotics officer's informant helped them hone in on the attackers. With that information, they looked through hundreds of hours of video surveillance tape from different downtown cameras and were able to place them in the area of the stabbing. Police then received a call from a witness - which they said is rare - and she was able to provide them further information that ultimately led to the arrests. Murdered: Antonio Muralles, left, had accidentally spilled coffee on McLamb, right, and his friends . Police are still seeking a third suspect in the crime. McLamb was arrested on an unrelated weapons charge on Saturday and was transferred to Stamford on Monday to be arraigned. He is being held in lieu of $2 million bond. McLamb didn't enter a plea. His public defender says he hasn't yet read McLamb's arrest warrant for the murder charge. Records show he has minor offenses on his rap sheet, including disorderly conduct, violation of probation, sixth-degree larceny and failure to appear at court, the Advocate reported. The 15-year-old boy was arrested at a home and his arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday. Authorities have said there is a possibility he will be charged as an adult, Fox reported. Relatives and friends have paid tribute to Muralles as a quiet, hard-working man who was employed at a factory. His colleagues were devastated when they heard the news of his death. Scene: Firefighters saw Mr Muralles collapse on a street corner outside this McDonald's in Stamford . 'They all started bawling, it was terrible,' co-worker Matthew Deedon told Fox CT. 'He was like a son to the owner. He was my best friend. He was family - that's the best way to put it.' Family members said Muralles, who lived with his niece and her husband, had hoped to move back to his native Guatemala one day to care for his ailing 92-year-old father. His remains are being flown back to the country after the Guatemalan government offered to cover the cost. His death is the city's first homicide in 2015.","Antonio Muralles was leaving a McDonald's in Stamford, Connecticut last Wednesday when he accidentally bumped into a group of teens .

"Apple’s Watch does what Google Glass and Pebble’s smartwatch failed at - create a beautiful, elegant device that works as a piece of jewellery, without even switching it on. Surprisingly light, the Watch oozes quality and attention to detail in the design and build. Apple has gone to great lengths to show off the specialist materials used to make it, and it shows. Scroll down for video . 'Apple’s Watch does what Google Glass and Pebble’s smartwatch failed at,' says Mark Prigg. 'It creates a beautiful, elegant device that works as a piece of jewellery, without even switching it on.' While in images it looks a little chunky, on the wrist it is a different story. The rounded curve means it fits comfortably on the wrist, and the range of bracelets means there’s one for pretty much every taste. For the record, I used the leather strap with magnetic ‘slap band’ on the Sport model, and also tested the Gold Edition. Using the Watch can be slightly confusing at first - the combination of digital crown, button and touchscreen mean that for your first few tries, you’ll probably press the wrong one. However, after a few minutes it becomes second nature to navigate around, and the digital crown in particular is perfectly weighted, making scrolling through long lists - such as music or your messages - simple. The touchscreen in particular is extremely accurate. I didn’t notice a single press in the wrong place, even on the main screen which has dozens of icons. We were able to try its features, and found even in the beta version we were using, the software is spot on - animation are smooth and fluid, with watch faces such as an opening rose showing off the screen . However, there is undoubtedly an initial confusion factor Apple will have to overcome. The experience of buying one in Apple’s Stores will be key to its success, as the Watch simply isn’t a device you can just pick up and understand instantly. However, once you know how to get around, the Watch is fluid, fast and the screen astonishingly bright. We were able to try all of its features, and found even in the beta version we were using, the software is spot on - animations are smooth and fluid, with watch faces really showing off the screen. Overall, the Apple Watch is by far the best wearable device on the market. Sadly, this is no indicator of success as there’s simply not much in the way of competition for the ‘normal’ consumer, despite Google’s attempts with Android Wear. Apple has taken the iOS software on its phones and tablets and tweaked it to better suit the watch's power, display size and functions. It has also invented a new typeface to make the screen easier to read . However, will people want one? Overall, the selling point from my (admittedly short) time with the watch seems to be its time-saving potential - as a phone addict, I’m constantly checking for messages. Having that on my wrist, along with the ability to easily reply and to see, will make the process faster. As with the Apple phone when it was first introduced, one feels we are only seeing Apple’s apps in any detail. When it ships on April 24th, developers around the world are expected to unleash a raft of apps. Much like the iPhone, these are what could really propel Apple Watch from being an elegant way to see your notifications, to being a true new computing platform Apple hopes it will be. On first impressions, it seems Apple has a very good chance of once again changing the way we interact with technology. The Apple Watch is available in three models: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport (pictured) and Apple Watch Edition . Models: The Apple Watch will be available in three models: the Apple Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition. All models will be sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions depending on which colour the owner chooses. Apple Watch is made of stainless steel with a sapphire crystal Retina display and ceramic back. Apple Watch Sport is made of 7000 Series Silver Aluminum with Ion-X Glass on a Retina display and composite back. Apple Watch Edition has a similar build to the Apple Watch but comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold. Interchangeable straps include fluoroelastomer (rubber), leather, and stainless steel. Prices: Apple Watch is made of stainless steel and prices range between $549 and $1048 for the 1.4-inch model and $599 and $1099 for the larger 1.7-inch version. Watch Sport is made of 7000 Series Silver Aluminum and ranges from $349 to $399. The premium Edition has a similar build to the Apple Watch but comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold. Prices start at $10,000. All of the watches can be pre-ordered from 10 April and goes on sale on 24 April. In the UK, Sport starts at £299, the standard Watch starts at £479 and the Edition model will cost £8,000. Gestures: Following last year's unveiling, Apple admitted the Watch is unlike any device it has ever made. It said it has 'reinvented all-new ways to select navigate and input that are suited to a smaller device worn on the wrist'. The Watch is also said to be able to sense force adding 'a new dimension to the user interface'. Force Touch uses electrodes around the flexible display to distinguish between a light tap and a deep press, and trigger instant access to a range of contextually specific controls - such as an action menu in Messages, or a mode that lets you select different watch faces. The Sport model is pictured left, the Watch is pictured centre and the Edition is pictured right. All of the watches can be pre-ordered from 10 April and will be available in stores from this date . Digital Crown:  On mechanical watches, the crown has historically been used to set the time and date and to wind the mainspring. Apple has adapted this and its 'digital' crown can be used to magnify content on the small display. Rotating the digital crown replaces the typical pinching motion used on iPhones and iPads and allows wearers to zoom and scroll without obstructing the screen. Pressing the crown will also return wearers to the home screen. Watch OS: Apple has taken the iOS software on its phones and tablets and tweaked it to better suit the watch's power, display size and functions. It has also invented a new typeface to make the screen easier to read. On mechanical watches the crown has historically been used to set the time and date and to wind the mainspring. Apple has adapted this and its 'digital' crown (pictured) can be used to magnify content on the  display. Rotating the crown replaces allows wearers to zoom and scroll without obstructing the screen . Sapphire display: Apple Watches have a laminated Retina display made from a 'single crystal of sapphire.' While on the Sport collection the screen has the added protection of Ion-X glass. Glances: The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. For instance, wearers can glimpse the weather forecast, check out what’s next on their calendar, or find their location on a map. They can then swipe through different Glances, or tap on one to go directly to its corresponding app for more details. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. On the back of the Watch's case is a sensor (pictured) that uses infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes to detect the wearer's heart rate . Vibration and notifications: The Watch has a built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. Any notification that appears on the connected phone will appear on the Watch. This is made from a linear actuator, or motor, inside the Apple Watch that produces haptic feedback. The wearer can then respond to these messages directly or swipe down to see the Notification Centre. This haptic feedback could also be used with Apple Maps, for example, to help people navigate. It will produced gentle vibrations to signal when to turn left or right. The Watch additionally understands questions in messages and offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. And this taptic engine means people can get someone's attention with a gentle tap or send their heartbeat remotely. There is no keyboard on the Watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri is also built into the Apple Watch. Heart rate sensor:  On the back of the Watch's case, a ceramic cover with sapphire lenses sits above a sensor that uses infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes to detect the wearer's heart rate. Apple Watch uses this sensor, along with an accelerometer and the GPS and Wi‑Fi in a connected iPhone, to measure physical movement such as steps, distance and calories. Inductive charging: The Watch uses Apple's MagSafe technology with inductive charging. This means it can be charged wirelessly by placing a connector near the back of the watch where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically. MagSafe is the name of the connector Apple uses with its MacBook range. Battery life: Mr Cook was vague about the battery life of the Apple Watch when it was  announced. He confirmed last month that it will last a full day after initially saying it will need to be charged overnight.","We tested the Sport model and the Gold Edition Apple Watch .

"The baby-faced Australian teenager who joined Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East has reportedly blown himself up in a suicide bomb attack. The militants released a photo showing 18-year-old Jake Bilardi inside a white van, which is he thought to have died in. Bilardi travelled from Melbourne to the Iraqi city of Ramadi in the Islamic State stronghold of Anbar last year, saying that he went to ISIS 'chasing death'. He is said to have carried out one of 13 suicide car bomb attacks on Iraqi army and security positions in Ramadi on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Suicide bomber: ISIS leaked a photograph of 18-year-old Australian Jake Bilardi (pictured) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up while driving it . An image of Bilardi sitting in front of an IS flag was posted to Twitter linking him to 13 suicide car bomb attacks on Iraqi army and security positions carried out in Ramadi in the Islamic State stronghold of Anbar . Islamic State militants have claimed Bilardi was involved in the string of attacks that killed at least 10 people and wounded 30 . It also emerged that Bilardi left improvised explosive devices at his family home in Melbourne before he fled to Iraq in August last year, with a blog post revealing that Bilardi was planning a terrorist attack in his home city if his dreams of fighting for ISIS were not realised. Ms Bishop said Bilardi's passport was cancelled in October last year, once authorities were made aware of his activities in the Middle East. On Thursday, an image of Bilardi sitting in front of an Islamic State flag was posted to Twitter with the caption: 'The Australian brother who carried out Martyrdom operation in Ramadi, Al Anbar.' A separate Islamic State Twitter account posted a photo of Bilardi with caption: 'Breaking News: Australian citizen Jake Bilardi aka Abu Abdullah carried the martyrdom operation in #Ramadi, #Iraq.' The Bilardi family has been greatly upset by the news with his aunt, Connie, clearly heard crying from inside the family home after word came through of the suicide bombing. Relatives have hunkered down in their Ascot Vale home, in Melbourne's north-west, refusing to speak on the revelations. A man, believed to be Connie Bilardi's partner, emerged from the family home on Thursday afternoon but would not be drawn on what relatives have been told about the matter nor how Jake's aunt was dealing with the shocking news out of the Middle East. But she had told Daily Mail Australia, in an earlier interview, that the teenager's decision to join the ranks of ISIS 'was devastating, just devastating'. When asked earlier this week how the young man's father was coping with the news his son was fighting with ISIS, his auntie's emotional response was: 'well, he's not'. Australian authorities have yet to confirm the 18-year-old died in the attacks, which killed at least 10 people and wounded 30. Bilardi's aunt Connie could be heard crying from inside her Ascot Vale home on Thursday, where she has placed an Australian flag next to the front door . Relatives have hunkered down in the Ascot Vale home, refusing to speak on the revelations . The aunt of Jake Bilardi, pictured in Ascot Vale Tuesday . A man, believed to be Connie Bilardi's partner, emerged from the family home on Thursday afternoon but would not be drawn on what relatives have been told about the matter . A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: 'The Australian Government’s capacity to confirm reports of deaths in either Syria or Iraq is extremely limited. 'Australians who become involved in overseas conflicts are putting their own lives in mortal danger. 'Any Australians fighting with non-state militia in Syria or Iraq should end their involvement in the conflict now and leave the conflict zone.' BBC Newsnight journalist Secunder Kermani said he interviewed Bilardi - who also used the Arabic name Abu Abdullah al-Australi - late last year. 'Abu Abdullah al Australi told me in December he came to ISIS ""chasing death""... Today it was announced he died in a VBIED attack in Ramadi,' Mr Kermani wrote on Twitter. 'I interviewed him last year and he said this was what he planned.' Extremists: The photograph of a youthful fighter posing with an assault rifle has been identified as Melbourne teen Jake Bilardi (pictured) In December, Mr Kermani alerted Bilardi to the fact that a photo of him - holding an assault rifle in front of an IS flag as he sat in between two armed extremists - was being widely publicised in Western media. 'He had no idea the photo was causing such a stir,' Mr Kermani tweeted on December 28. 'He said he had never agreed for his photo to be published publicly and was surprised it had been. 'When I showed him the photo he said ""It's out now I guess, to be honest my biggest problem is that it's a bad photo of me. hahaha.""' Bilardi has featured heavily on IS-linked social media channels, posing alongside heavily armed insurgents and the notorious black flag used by Jihadi groups. The young man from Melbourne has previously sent a series of sickening tweets to federal police in his native Australia - threatening to carry out attacks on his home country. 'Baby-faced': Jake pictured in a school photo from Year 10 - the year he converted to Islam, according to school friends . In one of the messages, the deceased extremist boasted that the Sydney Lindt cafe siege was 'just the beginning for you dogs'. The tweets reported by Daily Mail Australia in December also revealed he considered returning home to follow an Islamic State leader's order to kill disbelievers - including Australians. 'That's twice now I've seriously considered coming back and following Sheikh Adnani's fatwa in Australia,' he wrote. In December, Bilardi posted that he was in the Iraqi city of Ramadi and said he had 'made hijra [or departed] in August 2014. The former Craigieburn Secondary College student is believed to have converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10, shortly after his mother died of cancer. Footage has surfaced from his school days which appears to show Bilardi was bullied at the school. The video shows him being 'happy slapped' - a cruel social media phenomenon in which bullies would slap their victim and upload the humiliating footage online. Bullied: Friends told Daily Mail Australia that Bilardi was bullied while at high school in Craigieburn in Melbourne's north, and video emerged last night showing him being 'happy-slapped' One of his former school friends Ulus Shefket told Daily Mail Australia that he was an 'outcast' at school. He said: 'He was quiet and barely had any friends. Whenever you tried to joke with him he would react aggressively. 'He left Craigieburn Secondary College for another school because I think he felt like an outcast there.' Another former classmate Josh Green-Mercier added: 'He always looked depressed and was always looking down. 'He never communicated unless it was to do with culture and beliefs or math, he always listened to our conversations. Mot many people knew him and he never opened himself up. But Mr Green-Mercier also said that reports about his links to ISIS came as a 'surprise', adding: 'I didn't think he could join something like that.' Insults: In a series of tweets around Christmas time, Bilardi purportedly threatened more attacks after following the Martin Place siege . Threatening: In this message, Bilardi is referring to a call by an Islamic State religious leaders to commit graphic crimes against Americans, Frenchmen or their allies, including Australians .","Jake Bilardi from Melbourne reportedly blew himself up in suicide attack .

"A portrait of a rare Amur tiger family captured on film in the wild has provided clues that the notoriously solitary male big cats may play a role in rearing cubs. Scientists have long believed that the large adult males tend to leave females to raise their young and they are known to even attack and kill cubs when they come across them. However, in an astonishing new set of images captured by a camera trap in the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve in eastern Russia, a large male Amur tiger is seen leading a family of three cubs and their mother through the snowy forest. Scroll down for video of the tiger family passing the camera trap . The above photograph, captured with a camera trap, shows a family of three Amur tiger cubs and a female being led through a snowy forest by a large male in the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve in east Russia. It was created by stitching together several images . The images could help scientists learn new details of the role male tigers play in rearing their young. Dr Svetlana Soutyrina, deputy director for scientific programs at the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve who set the camera traps, said: 'We have collected hundreds of photos of tigers over the years, but this is the first time we have recorded a family together. Also known as the Siberian tiger, the Amur tiger is one of the most endangered big cats on the planet. They are a subspecies of tiger, that along with the Bengal tiger, are the biggest cats in the world. The largest male measured more than 3.5 metres (11 feet) in length and can weigh up to 318kg (701lbs). Their range once extended right across Siberia and down into China and South Korea. However, heavy poaching and loss of their natural range due to habitat loss has caused their populations to plummet. There are now just 500 left living in the wild. 'These images confirm that male Amur tigers do participate in family life, at least occasionally, and we were lucky enough to capture one such moment.' There have been a few rare examples of male Bengal tigers taking an active role in parenting in the past but it has never been seen in Amur tigers. In 2011 a male was found to be caring for a pair of orphaned cubs in the Ranthambore tiger reserve in Rajasthan, India. However, such behaviour is extremely rare and more commonly male tigers will kill the cubs of another male to reduce competition. After mating male tigers tend to leave a female to rear the cubs herself but will provide protection for them while they remain inside his territory. Large males will often have several females in their territory. In some rare cases they have also been seen to kill prey to feed his family. The pictures were captured as part of a project between the Wildlife Conservation Society's Russia Program, the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve and Udegeiskaya Legenda National Park. Camera traps set up in the forest captured the family in a series of 21 images over a period of two minutes as they walked past. The resulting images were then stitched together to show the family as a whole. Jonathan Slaght, , Russia Program Project Manager for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said: 'Male Amur tigers, which have home ranges that typically overlap the home ranges of several females, try to associate with those females as they patrol their own territories. 'An adult male might pass through a female’s territory every one or two months so, if the male and female were to meet up every time, this behavior might occur 6-12 times per year. 'However, considering that an adult male Amur tiger has a home range between 1,000-2,000 square kilometers, and an adult female has a territory about 400 square kilometers, having a camera trap in the right place at the right time to document this—especially with young in tow—is incredibly rare. 'In fact, this behaviour of an adult male Amur tiger traveling with a family unit of a female and her cubs has never been photographed before.' The large male tiger was the first to trigger the camera trap (above) as he broke the trail for his family through the forest in east Russia . The Amur tiger cubs, two of which can be seen above, followed closely in their parents footsteps, triggering the trap as they passed . Amur tigers are among the most endangered big cats in the world - thee are just 430-500 left remaining in the wild. Dr Dale Miquelle, Russia director for Wildlife Conservation Society, said: 'This is the first time such behaviour has been photographed for Amur tigers in the wild. 'These photos provide a small vignette of social interactions of Amur tigers, and provide an evocative snapshot of life in the wild for these magnificent animals.' The tigers were captured on film using camera traps that were set up in the forests of Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve in eastern Russia .","Extraordinary picture shows male leading female and cubs through Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve in east Russia .
Large adult male tigers usually have several mates within their territory and leave females to raise their cubs alone .
Males are usually highly aggressive and can pose a threat to small cubs - killing those belonging to rival males .
Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are critically endangered with less than 500 thought to be left  in the wild .
The new picture suggests that male tigers may play a far greater role in rearing cubs than was previously believed ."
"This family of wedding crashers risked the wrath of the bride to capture these photos. Brandi and Randy Russell, and their two children, take to the beach in tropical Hawaii to snap photobombing shots with unsuspecting wedding parties who have forked out thousands on the dream ceremonies. The family-of-four, originally from Lenexa in Kansas, lived on the idyllic island for five years and decided to take their quirky photos at the Ko Olina beach lagoon. Brandi and Randy pose with their arms in a heart shape as a couple marries in Hawaii . Smitten couples loved the beauty spot so much that they flocked there almost hourly, giving the family the idea that they could make their way into wedding albums back in 2004. Pediatric occupational therapist Brandi, 36, said: 'It was so frequent it was comical. 'I remember a specific conversation one day, when my husband and I wondered, ""How many random people's wedding photos are we in the background in our bathing suits?"". 'From there, it was a dare to go get in that wedding photo.' In this picture Brandi is seen pulling a funny face, however, she says they stopped directly photobombing wedding parties after some people complained . Brandi and Randy pose on the beach as a happy couple have their wedding snaps taken behind them . Brandi and Randy, 38, as well as kids Kyler, eight and Elle, six, have since turned the hobby into a family tradition. But they have been met with some resistance from happy couples and guests. Brandi said: 'We quickly realised actually photobombing wasn't cool. 'The wedding co-ordinators would shoo us away or we would get scowls from the bridal party. 'It's not our style to be rude. So, we started taking pics of ourselves with the wedding in the background. It was way less invasive and still fun.' In this picture a friend has taken a picture of Brandi and Randy larking about in the background of this happy couple's wedding day . Brandi says she and the family try to think up funny poses for their pictures, here they are hiding behind a tree . The family ditched their desperate clambering to get in the background of the pictures to take centre stage. They have since posed behind trees, made love hearts out of hands and even danced while in full view of wedding parties. Brandi said: 'It was a game we played only on vacation but now we include our kids in the fun and whoever else wants to play. 'This year, we are vacationing in Hawaii with my parents and we have enlisted my mum and dad as official beach wedding photo bomb paparazzi. 'We all start cheering and hi-fiving when we see a white gown and an entourage of bridesmaids on the beach. It is fun to figure out the silliest pose or best angle for our picture.' Brandi waves while in the background a couple stand on the beach having their wedding photographs taken . Sometimes the couple will even get their children involved, this time carrying them across the grass .","The Russell family crash people's wedding photos in Hawaii .

"Shaniqua Cherry wasn't due to deliver her fourth child until late March, but the baby girl came early — forcing Cherry and the plane on which she was a passenger to make an unscheduled stop in North Carolina so she could give birth. Her boyfriend, Hassan Lulu, said he had fallen asleep Tuesday as he and Cherry were flying to Atlanta with two of her three children. 'She just started tapping me,' the 25-year-old Lulu said. 'So I woke up and she told me her water had broke. I really didn't believe it at first. I was like ""Are you sure? Are you OK? You don't think you can wait?"" She said ""No, it's coming now, right now!""' Scroll down for video . Emergency landing: Shaniqua Cherry, 24, sits in bed with her newborn daughter, Nylah, and her daughter, Malaysha, 3, on Wednesday. Cherry gave birth in Greensboro after her water broke on a flight from Philadelphia to Atlanta that was diverted to Piedmont Triad International Airport . Lulu alerted the flight attendants, who used the intercom to ask if there was a doctor aboard the flight. No one stepped forward. The attendants then announced the plane would be making an emergency landing, Lulu said. 'Everybody was looking left to right, looking around,' Lulu said. 'I was looking at people, everybody trying to figure out what was going on.' American Airlines flight 611 from Philadelphia with 90 passengers aboard diverted to Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro. An ambulance met them on the tarmac to rush Cherry to a hospital, but the baby didn't wait. Cherry delivered a 7-pound girl, Nylah, in the ambulance on her way to Women's Hospital of Greensboro. All five family members were doing well Wednesday. Cherry said her contractions began as the plane took off. They were 40 minutes into the flight when her water broke. 'Yeah, I was kind of scared at first because I didn't know what was going to happen. I didn't want to have it on the plane,' Cherry said. 'I was trying to make it to Atlanta. I was like ""I think I can do it."" But it just got worse, so they had to stop.' Lulu said the flight was on the ground within 10 minutes after the flight diversion was announced. 'And then I had her in the back of the ambulance on the side of the road, somewhere. I don't know where,' Cherry said. Advice on the website www.babycenter.com suggests that it's generally safe to fly during the third trimester, but expectant mothers should discuss plans with a doctor or midwife before booking a flight. Cherry said her midwife told her that flying two weeks before her due date was fine. On its website, American Airlines says that on domestic flights under five hours, travel is not permitted within seven days before and after a pregnant woman's delivery date. Cherry and Lulu tried to get some rest in their hospital room with her active 2-year-old son, Lamarion, and 3-year-old daughter, Malaysha nearby. Seven-year-old Dayquan was waiting for his baby sister in Atlanta with relatives. Cherry worked for the U.S. Postal Service in Minneapolis before deciding to move to Atlanta to be with her mother, who was having health issues. Lulu worked with his uncle at a smoke shop. They both said they would be starting fresh, and with a story to tell their youngest child in a few years. 'I'm happy she's safe,' Cherry said. 'She's healthy. I'm exhausted, but happy that we have a baby.' Family: Shaniqua Cherry, 24, sits in bed with her newborn daughter, Nylah, boyfriend Hassan Lulu, 25, her daughter, Malaysha, 3, and her son, Lamarion, 2, at Women's Hospital of Greensboro, N.C., on Wednesday .

"Family doctors across the country will be offered up to £650 to work for three hours on Easter Saturday in a bid to reduce strain on hospitals over the bank holiday weekend. Surgeries in Essex, the West Midlands and London are being offered cash incentives to open during the four-day break. Doctors could be paid up to £650 for just three hours work on Easter Saturday - which includes £150 an hour plus £200 for administrative costs. The incentive is being offered to ensure there is enough cover over the four day Easter holiday - in a similar way to when doctors were persuaded to work on New Year's Day by being offered £80 an hour on top of their normal salary. Doctors are being offered up to £650 to work for three hours on Easter Saturday to ensure there is cover . GPs in Essex, the West Midlands and some London boroughs will be offered the incentive payments. The offer is only being made to those practices that are not already part of the directed enhanced service scheme - an agreement which sees GPs offered an annual payment for increasing cover at weekends. The bonus payments are being offered to cover patients with urgent care needs and will also be paid for doctors to carry out home visits, the Daily Express reported. Earlier this month GPs in the West Midlands criticised the £350 figure and said it needed to be quadrupled for them to consider working over the Easter break. However the offer has now been extended to include London and Essex, as well as in some parts of the north. A spokeswoman from NHS England, for London, confirmed GPs had been offered £650 for the extra hours work. She said the deal, along with the practices that had already signed up to directed enhanced services, meant that around 84 per cent of people would be able to access their GP over the weekend. She said: 'Across London, most boroughs are able to offer access to primary care services on Easter Saturday. GP practices that do not normally offer weekend cover  under the directed enhanced services scheme will be offered the payments . 'For the small number not achieving this level of coverage, we are working with local Clinical Commissioning Groups and will be offering an additional payment called a Local Enhanced Service to cover the costs. 'While the price has yet to be finalised it is likely to be around £650 for a three hour session in line with other areas in England. 'Our estimates show that 84 percent of people in London will be able to access GP services on Easter Saturday. We are determining additional requirements in a small number of boroughs.' The payment being offered is similar to that over New Year, when doctors were offered £80 an hour on top of their normal salary to work on New Year's Day. In the North and East some incentives will be offered, but these areas are understood to have greater cover over weekends. A memo from Barbara Hawkin, NHS deputy chief executive, was sent to trusts and groups of GPs saying there was a need to come up with plans to ensure there was enough cover over Easter. Incentive payments have been offered to cover weekends and bank holidays following Labour's 2004 renegotiation of their contracts. Under this agreement GPs were allowed to hand responsibility for out-of-hours care to private firms.","Doctors are to be offered cash incentives to work over the Easter holidays .

"Multi-millionaire hedge fund boss Martin Taylor who handed £600,000 to the Labour party . A multi-millionaire hedge fund boss who handed £600,000 to the Labour party, also stands to cash in from the privatisation of NHS services. Martin Taylor was unveiled last week as the generous benefactor who has become the party’s fourth largest donor over the past three years. Ed Miliband, who has had at least one private meeting with him, has attacked the Conservatives for being ‘the party of Mayfair hedge funds’, the exclusive part of London where Mr Taylor’s firm is based. And yesterday it emerged that Mr Taylor’s company, Nevsky Capital, advises a fund with a £10million stake in United Health, an American private healthcare giant which has run NHS-funded GP surgeries and is bidding for health service contracts. Tory MPs accused Mr Miliband of being a ‘hypocrite’ for taking his money after Labour have hit out at NHS ‘privatisation’ under the Coalition and claimed they would prevent it if they win office. United Health UK, its arm in this country, has run a number of GP surgeries over the past few years. But the firm was fined tens of millions of dollars in the USA for allegations it over-charged patients. It is also bidding for other NHS work including a controversial £1.2billion contract for cancer and end-of-life care in Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent, described as the health service’s biggest ever privatisation. The deal - for which a number of other private companies including Richard Branson’s Virgin Care Ltd are also bidding - has been opposed by Labour’s Andy Burnham who said all private contracts should be halted until after the General Election. The Nevsky Fund, managed by Mr Taylor’s firm, is based in the Cayman Islands, a secretive tax haven where investors can protect their identities and can avoid paying tax on the hedge fund’s profits. There is no suggestion Mr Taylor - who has said he is domiciled in the UK - or his investors have avoided tax. Tory MPs have accused Ed Miliband of being a ‘hypocrite’ for taking money from hedge fund boss Martin Taylor . Mr Taylor told the Sunday Times it might seem ‘a bit odd’ for a hedge fund manager to support Labour but he believed that ‘everyone should contribute to society and that those who are lucky enough to earn a lot should contribute more.’ Last week Labour faced allegations it had tried to cover up his identity, after it emerged a newspaper had first asked about his identity several months ago. He has given £591,800 since 2012. Parties are required to identify all donors who have given more than £7,500, but because only the person’s name is given it can be difficult to identify those with common names such as Mr Taylor. The party issued a statement from him last week, saying: ‘There is no mystery. This ‘Martin Taylor is me’. I am a born and bred Londoner, who also happens to be a hedge fund manager. And I am proud to support the Labour party.’ A Labour spokesman said yesterday: ‘We are grateful to people from all walks of life who support the Labour Party and our better plan. Unlike David Cameron and the Conservatives who increasingly rely on the money of an exclusive group of donors – the same people who they have rewarded with tax breaks - Ed Miliband will enter Downing Street owing nothing to anybody.’","Martin Taylor unveiled  as  party’s fourth largest donor over past three years .

"Enrolling at university is meant to be a time for widening skill sets academically, but many Brits are using it to broaden their horizons... well, horizontally. According to a new survey by student newspaper The Tab, university pupils in Britain have an average of 8.2 sexual partners by the time they reach the middle of their higher education. 11,549 students were questioned about their bedroom habits for the study, which also asked when people lost their virginity and how often they have sex. A new survey of university students has revealed that they have had an average of 8.2 sexual partners (picture posed by models) According to the answers they received, 22 per cent of students didn't lose their virginity until they were 18 years old, with the second most popular age to have sex for the first time being 16. 19 percent of those asked lost their virginity at 17 and 15 percent lost theirs just before the age of consent - at 15. A shocking 1.66 per cent of students revealed they first had sex when they were 13 years of age or younger. There was still a significant number of young men and women who were still waiting for the right partner though, with five per cent of people declaring that they were still virgins. 22 per cent of students questioned during the survey revealed they didn't lose their virginity until they were 18 years old (picture posed by models) The student newspaper also compiled a list of the universities where people lost their virginity earliest. Seven per cent of people who took part in the study followed by Aston and Ulster with six per cent each. Meanwhile, one in ten students who took part in the from Lancaster University said they were still virgins, followed by nine per cent at both Kent and Royal Holloway University.","New survey by student newspaper The Tab looks at university sex habits .

"Soaring numbers of Paddington Bear fans are trying their hands at making marmalade- thanks to last Christmas' hugely successful film. The British movie, which followed the adventures of the marmalade-loving bear from Peru, became the highest-ever grossing non-Hollywood family film after banking $200million at the box office. The 'Paddington Effect', coined by trade magazine The Grocer in December, has since seen rocketing surges in sales of marmalade- such as Golden Shred which has reported an increase of 24 per cent. Scroll down for video . Soaring numbers of Paddington Bear fans are trying their hands at making marmalade- thanks to last Christmas' hugely successful film (pictured) Now fans, inspired by the film, appear to be making their own preserve at home after one of the oldest names in jam making reported a major hike in their winter sales. Sales of Certo liquid pectin- an essential gelling agent for homemade jams and marmalades made from plant extract- are up 34 per cent year-on-year over the last three months. James Amar, Brand Manager for Certo, the UK's only liquid pectin maker, said: 'While demand for Certo peaks over the summer months at the height of the summer-fruit, jam-making season, we'd typically expect a less pronounced increase in sales December to February with the arrival of Seville oranges. 'This year, sales have rocketed and it seems the bear from deepest, darkest Peru with a passion for marmalade has rekindled the nation's appetite for this distinctive preserve.' The 'Paddington Effect', coined by trade magazine The Grocer in December, has since seen rocketing surges in sales of marmalade (left) and products to make the preserve at home such as Certo (right) the UK's only liquid pectin producters . Waitrose also reported soaring sales in marmalade-related products such as preserving sugar and Seville oranges. The supermarket also found a 282 per cent increase in people downloading the Waitrose Quick and Easy Seville Marmalade recipe. Tim Stevens, fresh fruit buyer at Waitrose, said last month: 'It's great news that more people than ever are discovering the joys of making marmalade at home — perhaps it is the influence of Paddington Bear.' Industry magazine The Grocer had previously shown that British shoppers were falling out of love with marmalade, as consumers turned to nut butters and chocolate spreads instead. But it reported that the release of Paddington shortly before Christmas had provided a boost for traditional British preserve. British film Paddington, which followed the adventures of the marmalade-loving bear from Peru, became the highest-ever grossing non-Hollywood family film after banking $200million at the box office . The film, which cost $55million to produce, saw the duffle coat-wearing bear dispatched from his native jungle by his aunt Lucy following an earthquake . Paddington, which was released in November last year starred Ben Whishaw as the voice of the Peruvian bear, alongside Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Julie Walters, and Nicole Kidman in live-action roles . Directed by Paul King, the independently-made film proved to be a huge hit around the world, finding favour with families and critics alike. The film, which cost $55million to produce, saw the duffle coat-wearing bear dispatched from his native jungle by his aunt Lucy following an earthquake. Before its release, the British Board of Film Classification gave Paddington’ a parental guidance rating, saying it contained ‘dangerous behaviour, mild threat, mild sex references and mild bad language.’ The board said the film's scenes of dangerous behaviour included the bear hiding inside a refrigerator. The rating means some scenes may be unsuitable for children under 8 years old. The development left English author Michael Bond, who created the original Paddington Bear series of books, ‘totally amazed’.

"Bobbi Kristina Brown's aunt has claimed that her boyfriend Nick Gordon is being investigated by police for trying to murder her. Leolah Brown wrote on Facebook that her family has 'strong evidence of foul play' relating to the day in January when Brown, 22, was found face-down in a bathtub. She is currently on life support in Atlanta, Georgia. The dramatic claims are part of a long-running family feud between Gordon and other parts of the Brown clan. Leolah made the claims - which she says law enforcement are aware of and following up - in response to Gordon, 25, being invited on the Dr Phil chat show. Life support: Bobbi Kristina Brown, pictured above with Nick Gordon in 2012, was found face-down in a bathtub in January. Gordon has now been sensationally accused of trying to kill her . In a message addressed to host Phil McGraw, she said: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece Bobby Kristina Brown. 'We have strong evidence of foul play. Until this investigation is completed by law enforcement, I would ask that you or anyone else not provide this individual a platform to spin this situation to his benefit. 'If Nick Gordon does not have the courage to speak with my brother Bobby Brown and/or law enforcement about what happened the day my niece's body was found in a bathtub, he does not deserve to have a platform to speak to anyone of your caliber until this investigation is concluded.' Bobbi Kristina was found in the bathtub at the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia. Police in the town were not immediately able to comment on the attempted murder allegation when contacted by DailyMail.com. It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived. Few other details have emerged. There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub. Leolah kept up the attack in later comments on her Facebook page. She later wrote: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!' The show is describing the episode,  due to air March 11, as an 'intervention'. Accusation: Leolah Brown made the accusation in a Facebook post addressed to Phil McGraw, who has filmed a segment with Nick Gordon for the Dr Phil show . Controversial: Bobbi Kristina's aunt attacked Dr Phil, right, for making the forthcoming program with Nick Gordon, left. The episode, pictured above, is yet to air . A spokesman for the show said Gordon and his mother, Michelle, described him as haunted by what happened to Brown and the similar tragedy that befell the late Whitney Houston. Houston was found face-down and unresponsive in about a foot of water in a bathtub in the Beverly Hilton hotel on Feb. 11, 2012, just before the Grammys. On the show, Michelle said: 'As we sit here right now, my son's life hangs in the balance.  When Whitney was found, he administered CPR to her and called me as he was standing in front of her saying, ""Mom, why couldn't I do it? I couldn't get air into her lungs."" 'He won't let go of the guilt.' Gordon said he has suffered mental anguish and panic attacks since Brown was found, and over Houston's death.","Leolah Brown wrote dramatic accusation against Gordon on Facebook .

"An obese nurse who lost 10st and was left with folds of saggy skin all over her body paid £20,000 to get her sex life back.

In 2009, she had lost two stone naturally but was unable to slim down any further. Karen was not eligible for treatment on the NHS, so in June 2009 she booked in for gastric band surgery at the private Spire Parkway hospital in Birmingham for £5,000. She said: 'After the surgery, my stomach was so small I was on a liquid diet for six weeks and then tiny portions.'

Karen was so pleased with the results she wanted more surgery and taking Mr Smith's concerns on board, she opted to have more serious operations, a tummy tuck and thigh lift, in the UK . In late 2010, Karen made a doctors appointment to start the process of having the skin removed. She said: 'All the procedures I’d need came in at £35,000. I couldn’t afford to have it done privately this time and it was making me severely depressed.' After being turned down for a loan, Karen’s depression caused her to tell Mr Smith to leave her. She said: 'We’d been together 22 years, had spent so long really happy but I couldn’t remember the last time we’d had sex. 'Every time he came close to me, I cringed imagining his secret disgust at how I looked. I knew it wasn’t rational. 'He refused and insisted I looked amazing and he loved me – but I was miserable and just couldn’t seem to pick myself up.'

She said: 'I was impressed by how clean the wards were and the qualifications of the surgeons.' Just a day after the surgery in August 2012, the dressings were removed. She said: 'My bingo wings were gone. In the 30 degree heat, I spent the next few days recuperating in the sun.' In 2009, she had lost two stone naturally but was unable to slim down any further.

"U.S. narcotics agents with Top Secret clearances had wild 'sex parties' with prostitutes hired by Colombian drug cartel members, according to a blockbuster report from the Justice Department's internal investigations arm. The Drug Enforcement Agency has yet to comment on the findings in the exposé from the DOJ's Office of Inspector General. At least seven DEA agents admitted to investigators that they had sex with hookers while on overseas assignments. But instead of firing or prosecuting them, the agency treated their cases as a 'local management issue' and suspended them for between 2 and 14 days. The IG cautioned in the report, released Thursday morning, that U.S. law enforcement personnel who engage in illicit sex – even in places where it's legal or unofficially tolerated – can be vulnerable to 'coercion, extortion, and blackmail.' The Republican chairman of the congressional panel that specializes in inter-governmental investigations lobbed rhetorical bombs at the Justice Department after the report surfaced online, calling its allegations 'truly stunning.' 'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE REPORT . TROUBLE IN COLOMBIA: Drug Enforcement Agency officers had hooker parties allegedly paid for with drug cartel money . NARCO-PERVS: DEA agents had Top Secret clearances when they went on sex romps with hookers . 'We need to hold them accountable and, given the clear evidence in the OIG report, they should be fired immediately,' he said of the offending agents. 'We need to weed out those who risk our national security, embarrass the county, and skirt the law.' Chaffetz promised that his panel, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 'will pursue this vigorously' after next week's congressional recess. In all, the IG report flagged 621 cases where agents in the FBI, DEA, ATF and U.S Marchalls Service were accused of a wide variety of sex-related offenses. They ranged from sexting and sexual liaisons between supervisors and subordinates to the consumption of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors and prison imnates. In the prostitudion cases, the IG wrote, 'DEA supervisors treated the alleged misconduct as a local management issue' even though the 'these special agents held Top Secret clearances.' One case involved agents 'patronizing prostitutes and frequenting a brothel while in an overseas posting. ... It was also alleged that one of the subjects in the supervisors’ group assaulted a prostitute following a payment dispute.' 'The Acting Assistant Regional Director who supervised the two special agents in this case,' investigators wrote, 'was also alleged to have solicited prostitutes ... In that case, the AARD allegedly engaged in sexual relations with prostitutes at a farewell party in the AARD’s honor.' 'There were also allegations operational funds were used to pay for the party and the prostitutes who participated.' In all, six hookers attended that soiree. Supervisors allegedly knew about it but never referred the case to the DOJ for disciplinary action. A tipster ultimately blew the whistle on two of the agents, claiming in an anonymous letter to DEA higher-ups that they had frequented prostitutes on a regular basis while on oversead tour-of-duty assignments. In a separate case, the inspector general describes DEA agents who attended prostitute 'sex parties arranged by a Colombian law enforcement officer and funded with money from drug cartels themselves. The parties, the IG said, happened in the agents' government-leased apartments over a period of several years. Agents' laptops, BlackBerry devices, and other government-issued equipment were typically lying around, creating 'potential security risks' and potentially making agents vulnerable to 'extortion, blackmail, or coercion.' Foreign officers later claimed they held on to the American agents' guns  while they were indulging in the hooker-fests. They also claimed they gave three DEA supervisory agents 'money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members.' Ultimately, 7 of the 10 agents the IG interviewed admitted taking part in the 'sex parties.' They were suspended for between 2 and 10 days, but never prosecuted criminally. Overall, the DEA limited its punishment to a maximum of 14 days, in part because Colombian authorities generally turn a blind eye to the sex trade. 'The DEA Inspector told us that prostitution is considered a part of the local culture and is tolerated in certain areas called ""tolerance zones"",' the GI wrote. 'According to the Inspector, it is common for prostitutes to be present at business meetings involving cartel members and foreign officers.' ANGRY: 'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz . The DOJ's inspector general found a wide range of sex-related offenses in the case files of the FBI, DEA, ATF and US Marshals Service, including sex with prostitutes and sexual assault of minors . The U.S. Marshalls Service also got a black eye in the inspector general report. In one 2010 case described in detail, two deputy marshalls traevled to Thailand to pick up a criminal defendant who was being extradited to the United States. Every time the State Department tried to contact one of the men, one of two women with foreign accents would answer his phone and say he couldn't be disturbed. 'A local investigator for the State Department spoke to one of the women in Thai' and 'confirmed she was a prostitute,' the IG wrote. When he got home, the deputy was forbidden to travel overseas again. But he fuond a way to conduct at least one more extradition mission anyway and kept his security clearance. A nother deputy 'entered into a romantic relationship' with the spouse of a fugitive criminal suspect. When his supervisors told him to break off the fling, it took him a year to do it. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was relatively unscathed by the IG investigation, with one glaring exception. An ATF Director of Industry Operations, investigators wrote, 'solicited consensual sex with anonymous partners and modified a hotel room door to facilitate sexual play.' Management at the hotel caught him disabling a fire detection system; he insisted he had done it before with no problem. Separately, an FBI Assistant Section Chief who trained his fellow agents on child exploitation and human trafficking issues 'engaged in multiple consensual and commercial sexual encounters over a 7-year period,' according to the report. His partners included 'foreign nationals, including prostitutes, strippers, students in his classes, and members of foreign law enforcement.'

"Photographer Reuben Krabbe had been dreaming of capturing the Northern Lights for four years. He finally persuaded a group of skier friends to join him on a risky mission to ski down the snow-capped Tombstone Mountains, in Canada, as the spectacular show glimmered above them. Krabbe and friends, Tobin Seagel, Dave Gheriani, and Joel Jacques, travelled for six days to reach Tombstone Territorial Park in Yukon, braving avalanches and sub zero temperatures. The off-piste skiing location boasts some of the best views of the Northern Lights in Canada. Scroll down for video . Spectacular slalom: Professional ski and mountain bike photographer Reuben Krabbe, 24, travelled with three friends to take pictures of the mystical display . Temperatures at night reached -33 degrees Celsius, but that did not discourage the adventurous group from carrying on with their six day mission . The off-piste skiing location boasts some of the best views of the Northern Lights in Canada, which Krabbe described as 'mesmerising' When the group started the journey to the 1,500ft mountains, they encountered temperatures dropping to a freezing -33 degrees Celsius. They were unperturbed, and remained dedicated to their mission to slalom under the natural light show. Professional ski and mountain bike photogragher Reuben Krabbe, 24, said: 'We all wanted to make the trip happen, and Tobin and I had talked about trying to capture the single photograph of the Northern Lights and a skier. 'We spent a total of six days on the slopes, from leaving our truck to arriving back at it. 'The moment was very unusual and mesmerising. 'It was difficult to concentrate on a specific task when such a beautiful thing is happening above you.' The photographer has been skiing since his parents taught him at the age of four, and it has since become a massive part of his life. All the skiing conditions on the mission were off-piste, and in avalanche conditions, up the high mountains. The team braved avalanche and harsh weather conditions but Krabbe fulfilled his four-year wish to capture the Northern Lights in Canada . Friends Tobin Seagel, Dave Gheriani, and Joel Jacques spent six days with Krabbe traversing the Tombstone Territorial Park in Yukon, Canada . To witness the natural disco in its magnificence, you have to head north towards the Arctic, above latitude 60 degrees . The cause of the stunning Northern Lights is solar wind interacting with the Earth's magnetic field, creating the  beautiful, natural light show. The electrically charged particles are drawn to the Earth's poles and their colours are a result of the different gases in the atmosphere. In the northern hemisphere they are known as the aurora borealis, and many tourists flock to witness the ethereal display, despite the often high cost and cold temperatures. The mysterious show also occurs in the southern hemisphere, the aurora australis, its main audience being the penguins. Krabbe said: 'I love to create images that last in a person's head, and I think about it for a long time before I capture it. 'So, a single shot like the northern lights will always be special.'

"The personal details of 31 world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron were mistakenly leaked by an organiser of Australia's G20 summit, it was reported today. An employee of the Australian immigration department accidentally e-mailed a member of the Asian Cup football organising committee a cache of sensitive data including passport and visa numbers. But in a letter to the Australian privacy commissioner revealing the blunder, the director of the visa services division did not consider it necessary to inform those world leaders of the privacy breach. The personal details of 31 world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron were mistakenly leaked by an organiser of Australia's G20 summit in November (above), it has been reported . The Guardian reported that an Australian immigration official accidentally e-mailed the passport numbers, visa details and other information about world leaders to an Asian Cup organiser on November 7. Other leaders who came to Brisbane for the November 15-16 event and whose information was exposed included German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, it said. The newspaper said details obtained under Australia's freedom of information laws showed data relating to 31 international leaders was mistakenly emailed to the wrong person due to human error. The mistake arose after the immigration worker failed to check that the autofill function on the email system had addressed the email correctly, it said. Breach: Leaders who came to Brisbane for the G20 event in November and whose information was exposed included British Prime Minister David Cameron and Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured above) The immigration officer recommended that the world leaders not be notified of the breach because the e-mail had been deleted and 'actions... taken to limit the further distribution of the email.' Australia's deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to answer why the world leaders were not notified of the breach. 'The prime minister and the immigration minister must explain this serious incident and the decision not to inform those affected,' she told The Guardian. Australia's immigration department today confirmed there had been a data breach, but gave no details and did not say whether the world leaders had since been informed. Australia's deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured, above, with Angela Merkel at the summit) to answer why the world leaders were not notified of the breach . 'The breach was immediately referred to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner,' a spokeswoman for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said in a statement. 'The data was immediately deleted by the recipient and was not distributed further.' Australia hosted the Asian Cup in January. The Australian immigration spokeswoman said the department had reviewed and strengthened its email protocols to limit and contain future breaches.","Immigration official sent data to Asian Cup football tournament organiser .

"A woman who was so self-conscious of her flat chest that she cancelled a girls' holiday has revealed how a breast enlargement operation has given her the confidence she has always craved. Jade Hotchkiss, 22, from Nottingham, said she 'felt like a boy' growing up, and was even too embarrassed of her 34B chest size to go shopping with her friends. At her lowest point, Jade admits that she even pulled out of a trip abroad after getting all the way to the airport because she was too self-conscious to go. Scroll down for video . Now Jade, pictured right, is happy to show off her figure in a bikini, pictured here on holiday with two friends . 22-year-old Jade Hotchkiss- pictured in the khaki trousers - has revealed that before her boob job she was left feeling so self conscious she couldn't go on her girls holiday . Now, four years on, Jade is happier than ever after having a life changing breast operation - taking her to a 34G - at the Transform Cosmetic Surgery clinic two years ago. She said the enlargement has allowed her to enjoy holidays with her friends, and that she has a new job - and has even bagged herself a boyfriend - all down to her new-found confidence. Jade says that before her transformation she didn't even want to go out and would look unhappy in pictures  but now she enjoys heading out with her pals . Jade, who was also bullied at school, said her issues with her body started from a young age. She told Femail: 'I remember in PE at school I would go to the toilets and get changed by myself and I'd always wear baggy jumpers to cover myself up. 'I just didn't feel like I looked like a girl without boobs and I was badly bullied for having a flat chest. 'All my friends had them and I just couldn't understand why I didn't, when you're young you do look at yourself a lot and compare yourself to other people.' Pretty Jade revealed that from a young age she was bullied for her flat chest which left her feeling like a boy . Jade, who used to stuff her bras in order to give herself a fuller bust, said that so low was her confidence that it stopped her doing things with her mates. 'I just had no confidence, I wouldn't go out, or go shopping with my friends. One of the lowest points was when I was 18,' she revealed. 'I was going on a girls holiday and we were at the airport and everyone was there in crop tops and shorts and I was the only one wearing jeans and I just couldn't go through with it.' It wasn't until she was 20 - after three years of saving up her tips as a waitress - that Jade decided to do something to change her body and her life. She said of deciding to have a boob job: 'I was working as a waitress and I saved up all of my tips for three years and I didn't tell anyone that I was going to do it. 'I literally booked it and went by myself. Afterwards I called my older sister, and then I told my parents. 'They were really happy for me but I think they wished I'd told them so they could have been there for me.' Jade (left) would stuff her bra in order to make her breasts look bigger but she still felt self conscious . The difference in Jade is clear to see as she larks about with some pals at a gig . And the change in Jade has been noticeable to everyone she knows: 'Everyone says now that they've noticed the change in my confidence. 'You don't realise just how much these things can affect you, it changes your whole life.' And the pretty brunette no longer feels like she has to hide herself away under baggy jumpers. She said: 'Now I feel like I can wear different clothes. I'm not a real girly girl but I'll wear dresses that show off my figure. 'And I'm not afraid to go shopping with my friends anymore or get changed in front of other people.' Jade's even bagged herself a boyfriend and the pair are planning on moving in together: 'We're looking to buy a house together. I met him a few weeks after I had the operation. 'For years my friends had been asking me to go out with them to the town but I never went, I just didn't have the confidence. They persuaded me to come and I met him on my first ever night out. 'I like to think he would have fancied me whether I had the operation or not but I don't think I would have felt good enough to speak to him.' Jade has also bagged herself a boyfriend and a new job since having the boob job and says it has boosted her confidence massively . Pictured in Thailand Jade now enjoys showing off her figure in a bikini, something she never would have dreamt of doing before the operation . Jade's work life has improved as well: 'I'm now a manager of a restaurant and hoping to be promoted in the next six months. 'Before I was a waitress and I wouldn't have said boo to a goose or even spoken to a manager. I'm also doing a degree online in English Literature and I'd love to be a teacher one day' Jade continued: 'When I look back at pictures of myself now I just don't think it looks like me. You can just see I don't look happy whereas now I look at pictures of myself and I have so many happy memories.' Speaking of choosing Transform Jade said: 'I went to Transform because they were the only people who didn't make me feel pressured. 'I'd been to so many consultations but I kept being made to feel like I had to make a decision there and then. It felt like I was talking to a friend, they actually listened to my needs.' 'I went from and 34B to 34G, before I didn't even wear bras I would just wear like kids crop tops. 'Now I enjoy going underwear shopping, I think as a woman you feel powerful when you're wearing a matching set and it's so nice to feel like nothing's off limits to me.'","Jade Hotchkiss spent years being bullied for her small breasts .

He made a rare appearance on the school run with Daniel and Samuel and invited the TV cameras along as part of the move to present him as a family man . As part of his profile interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain, Mr Miliband took his sons to school, but then let slip that he rarely does it. He said: 'It's a huge pleasure to be able to see them during the day, it's a rare treat for me.' Mr Miliband also admitted that he worries about the impact of his job on his sons. He said: 'Yeah I do worry about that, I do worry about that. It's a constant battle and it's a constant thing that I've got to just be conscious of to make sure whatever job I'm doing now and in the future, that I make sure that I make sure that there's that time for them. 'I don't want them looking back and thinking, 'well Dad was never around' 'Dad was always on the phone', I think they probably would say Dad is on the phone a lot but I don't want them thinking you know I was just, I was never there.'

'We've tried, we've sort of had a bit of a discussion about the red team, we're the red team. We've even talked about the debates a bit, what Daniel calls 'the argument about the arguments'.'

'He's got his own thing that he's doing and I think he wants to carry on focusing on that. One of the reasons he left after the leadership contest was because he didn't want the soap opera.'

"All shops will be allowed to offer ‘click and collect’ services for people to collect their parcels from next month. Ministers say allowing online shoppers to pick up their purchases at local shops, rather than have them delivered at home, will give a boost to the high street. Retailers will no longer have to apply for planning permission – which costs £195 per application– and fill in reams of paperwork before being allowed to offer the service from April 15. Online boost: All shops in the UK will be allowed to offer ‘click and collect’ services for people to collect their parcels from next month . The UK is the biggest user of ‘click and collect’ services in the world - and use is expected to double in the next three years. But planning minister Brandon Lewis said high streets do not have to lose out, because online shopping can bring people into town centres. Many people who are at work all day - and know they will miss the postman – can choose to have parcels delivered to their local shop where they can collect them at a convenient time. Mr Lewis said: ‘Far from threatening the high street, online shopping offers a new opportunity. How we shop is changing radically and I want to help our high streets thrive from online competition. Ministers say allowing online shoppers to collect at local shops will give a boost to the high street . ‘These measures will mean even more retailers can offer ‘click and collect’ services, encouraging shoppers to visit their businesses and pick up their purchases at a time that suits them.’ There was a boom in Christmas shopping via click and collect this year – with John Lewis saying half its customers picked up parcels in store rather than having them posted to their homes in December. Supermarkets and department stores are already using the service, and some allow ebay and Amazon customers to pick up their purchases instore. Ministers also want to make it easier for a bank or estate agent to change use, so it can become a restaurant, cinema or gym without the owners going through undue costs and paperwork.","Shops won't have to apply for planning permission for 'click and collect'

"A married physical education teacher from Tennessee has been arrested and charged with repeatedly having sex with a 14-year-old student.

Bad teacher: Shelley Lott Brown, 32, a middle school PE teacher from Tennessee, has been charged with two counts of statutory rape by an authority figure . According to a criminal complaint, Mrs Brown had sex with the teenage boy at least on two occasions during the summer of 2014, reported The Tennessean. Brown, a mother of two, was taken into custody after an anonymous caller tipped off the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services in October about her alleged tryst with the student.

A five-month investigation into the allegations against Brown culminated with her surrender Tuesday. According to a cached bio on Goodlettsville Middle School's website, Brown, a graduate of Davidson Academy, has been at the school for more than eight years.

"He's considered one of the MLB's most promising prospects, but Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Daniel Norris has chosen to escape the hype surrounding his baseball career by living out of a 1978 Volkswagon van outside a Wal-Mart. Predictably earning himself the nickname 'Van Man', the 21-year-old - who received a $2 million signing bonus -  has currently parked the camper outside one of the mega-stores in the suburbs of Florida, saying it brings him peace of mind. He works out in the carpark, cooks his meals - mostly eggs and stir fries - on a portable stove and likes to go surfing during the day. 'It's like a yin-and-yang thing for me,' he told ESPN in a new interview. 'It's like a yin-and-yang thing for me': Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Daniel Norris has chosen to escape the hype surrounding his baseball career by living out of 1978 Volkswagon camper he bought for $10,000 . Twins: Having traveled all over in the van, Norris has now pulled up stumps at a Wal-Mart in suburban Florida . 'I'm not going to change who I am just because people think it's weird. 'The only way I'm going to have a great season is by starting out happy and balanced and continuing to be me. 'It might be unconventional, but to feel good about life I need to have some adventure.' Norris paid $10,000 for the van in 2011 - straight after high school. He refers to it as 'Shaggy'. Norris doesn't spend all his time outside Wal-Mart. While there, he likes to read Jack Kerouac at night using a torch, but he also goes on trips through the mountains of Tennessee and to surfing destinations along the Carolina coast.

"Police announced Wednesday they had closed an investigation into sexual assault claims by a former University of Missouri swimmer who committed suicide without charging anyone for her alleged rape. Investigators in Columbia, Missouri, 'encountered several obstacles' while looking into claims Sasha Menu Courey made to health professionals that she'd been sexually assaulted by up to three football players as a sophomore. Without DNA evidence, video recordings or a detailed recounting of the alleged assault, police could only rely on witnesses, who would not cooperate with the investigation, spokeswoman Bryana Maupin said. Scroll down for video . Prospect: Sasha Menu Courey was 20 when she died, her swim career cut short after being considered a prospect for the Canadian national swim team and heavily recruited by University of Missouri . After Menu Courey's suicide in June 2011 at the age of 20, an independent investigation found the University of Missouri had failed to properly respond to the swimmer's sexual assault claims. While some of the people Menu Courey told she had been raped were medical personnel bound by confidentiality rules, ESPN reported that the former Mizzou student wrote in a diary that she had spoken about it with an athletic department administrator. A story in the Columbia Daily Tribune in 2012 also noted that Courey mentioned the sexual assault in her journal. Under Title IX rules, an education institute is required to begin an appropriate investigation as soon as a possible sexual assault is known. Menu Courey's parents told ESPN that instead of the university following up on the report of sexual assault, head swimming coach Greg Rhodenbaugh stop speaking with them. Raised in Toronto and once considered a prospect for the Canadian national swim team, Menu Courey had struggled with undiagnosed borderline personality disorder that had led her to attempt suicide when she was 16. Stellar student: While she couldn't swim her freshman year over eligibility concerns relating to her Canadian education, Menu Courey was a straight-A student at Mizzou . Mizzou: Rolandis Woodland, a friend of Menu Courey and a football player, said she sent him a video of the assault, which showed three men involved, though he claims the video has disappeared . In February 2010, when she was in her second sophomore semester, Menu Courey claims she was sexually assaulted after a consensual encounter with a male friend. We 'were falling asleep & then i heard the [door] open & some other guy walked in & locked the door & i couldnt really see who it was & i never saw a face the whole time,' Courey wrote in an online chat with a rape crisis counselor later uncovered in a records request. 'i remember just sitting upright in bed at the sound of someone walking in. & i just remember feeling really scared thinking that the two guys had planned this or something.' 'so my first thought was figure out who this other person was in case so that if i needed the informaton i would have it later... the guy told me his name & then he pulled down his pants & put on a condom & just knew i was screwed ...' 'the guy just lift up my dress & next thing i knew he inserts from behind. by that point tears were falling more but i wasnt loud & didnt anything. and then i just snapped and kind pushed him away & yelled no! and then he just left.' Abandoned: Lynn Courey and Mike Menu said that even after a story about their daughter's alleged rape was published, the university did not take action, and swim coach Greg Rodenbaugh (right) cut off contact . Seeking answers: Rolandis Woodland (right), a University of Missouri football player and friend of Menu Courey's, said she started talking about suicide the morning after the alleged assault by fellow players . A friend, Rolandis Woodland, who played football at University of Missouri, said Menu Courey began speaking about taking her own life the morning after the assault allegedly occurred. Two months later, she entered treatment at the campus hospital to deal with her suicidal thoughts, after which she started seeing counselors and taking anti-depressants. After a back injury, coach Rhodenbaugh asked her not to take part in training and competitions, which he told ESPN was to motivate her to focus on counseling, in spite of records that showed Menu Courey had not stopped going. In March 2011, as she experienced mood swings and anxiety that her scholarship and place on the University of Missouri swim team were in jeopardy, she entered the school's psychiatric center. After being released to her parents, she went to a hotel where she slashed her wrists before a police officer was able to wrest the razor blade out of her hands. It was during a 96-hour hospitalization following this incident that a member of the Missouri athletic department, Meghan Anderson, visited Menu Courey and had her sign a University Withdrawal Form, which coach Rhodenbaugh characterized as a way to prevent her grades from falling. In the aftermath, Menu Courey began worrying more about school. She moved to Boston and was admitted to McLean Hospital for borderline personality disorder, which one doctor there told ESPN had been worsened by the alleged attack. In May, she called Anderson and spoke to her about the rape, according to a journal that she kept, though Anderson claims the conversation was about Menu Courey returning to school. Later that month, she received a letter from the university informing her she was no longer eligible for financial aid, though the university described it as a form letter sent to student who had withdrawn from the school and said it did not apply to Menu Courey's athletic scholarship. In June, the former Mizzou swimmer ingested 100 tablets of Tylenol while still hospitalized, dying two days later from organ failure.","University of Missouri, where Sasha Menu Courey was a student, was criticized for not conducting a full investigation into the assault claims .

"They are not recognised by neighbouring countries, do not know their ages, and have little concept of reading or writing. The Bajau people are known as the 'sea gipsies,' as they spend most of their time living on boats and working in the turquoise Pacific Ocean. Photographer Réhahn spent eight days among the sea nomad children in Borneo, learning about their fascinating aquatic lives. Scroll down for video . Like a fish! The Bajau children in Borneo spend time on boats from an early age, and begin their hunting around the age of eight . French photographer, Réhahn, 35, said the friendly children loved him taking their pictures and seemed happy to see a foreigner . Réhahn uses a Canon 5d Mark III to capture his stunning pictures, and spent eight days living among the tribe to learn about their lives . The Bajau live in small boats or stilted huts, relying on their extensive knowledge of the ocean to make a living through fishing. The young children learn from a young age how to swim or dive, and start their hunting as young as eight years old. Despite many of them not knowing their ages, or written communication, Réhahn described the peace and serenity that emanated from the water tribe. 'The children are like fish in the sea. Young children are sometimes on the boat alone, but all seemed very happy to see a foreigner,' the 35-year-old French photographer said. 'Children were jumping from a wooden bridge and they wanted me to take their photo. They were perfect models.' The Bajau tribe's beliefs centre around a combination of animism and Islam, with their relationship with the ocean and its inhabitants being at the heart of the nomads' existence. Happy and content! Réhahn said the sea gipsies were like fish in the water, and spent a lot of their time jumping happily into the water from a bridge . Due to extended periods under the surface, the sea nomads have an enhanced underwater-vision, perfect for spearfishing . Réhahn said: 'When I arrived, children jumped on the boat to come near me. Some families invited me to their house' Being around water from a young age results in the best divers being able to stay submerged at depths of 20 metres for several minutes, while they hunt for fish. The hunter-gathers mainly use spearfishing to get their produce, but can dive for pearls and sea cucumbers. Studies have shown that  youngsters have exceptionally good underwater-vision due to being constantly in the ocean environment. As diving is such a big part of their lives, often their ear drums rapture at an early age. Regardless of their age, everyone in the Bajau tribe has a place and helps in some way to catch the fish . Splashing around! Bajau children enjoy their water existence and play in the turquoise waves . The best divers are able to stay underwater at depths of 20 metres for several minutes, while they hunt for fish . Réhahn, who has over 180,000 fans of his work on his fan page, said: 'They are very welcoming and friendly. When I arrived, children jumped on the boat to come near me. Some families invited me to their house.' Although some of the seafaring tribe are born on the ocean and never live on the land, more frequently the sea gypsies are heading to the shore for trade and to gather materials to build boats. Réhahn said the Bajau roughly know about age but time doesn't matter much to them, and they live in the present, and live only for and by the water. Some female sea gipsies give birth on their huts with stilts, although many come to land to trade and get supplies, there are a small number who have lived entirely on the ocean throughout their whole lives .

"The chameleon’s ability to change colour may seem magical, but scientists have finally solved the riddle of how the reptile can blend into the background so effectively. Swiss researchers revealed that chameleons use futuristic nanotechnology more advanced than anything humans possess to carry out their extraordinary colour changes. The reptiles are capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival. Scroll down for video . Swiss researchers have revealed that chameleons appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival. A stock image of a colourful panther chameleon is shown . The process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores. Not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage to spectacular mating displays,  they also protect it from overheating. It was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells, allowing the animal to change hues. Like some other reptiles, chameleons display a wide range of colours produced not by pigments but ‘optical interference’ between different wavelengths of reflected light from tiny crystals, the researchers claim. The crystals are arranged in layers within the iridophores. In studies of the panther chameleon, which comes from Madagascar, scientists found that the creature actively controls the way its iridophore crystals generate colour. The reptiles appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival.

Not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage and spectacular mating displays, but they also protect it from overheating. It was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells. It can turn from a camouflaged green to a bright yellow to attract a potential mate, for example. Physicist Jeremie Teyssier, from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, said: ‘We discovered that the animal changes its colours via the active tuning of a lattice of nanocrystals. ‘When the chameleon is calm, the latter are organised into a dense network and reflect the blue wavelengths. ‘In contrast, when excited, it loosens its lattice of nanocrystals, which allows the reflection of other colours, such as yellows or reds."" The scientists also uncovered a second deeper layer of iridophores containing larger and less ordered crystals which reflect infrared light, which they reported in the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. By reflecting back the sun's heat energy, the cells prevent the chameleon getting too hot in the tropical sun. The scientists made their discovery by watching video footage of chameleons changing colour from blue to green then into yellow and orange – a pattern that couldn’t be explained by pigments in the animal’s skin. The process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores. In studies of the panther chameleon (stock image), which comes from Madagascar, scientists found that the creature actively controls the way its iridophore crystals generate colour . They modelled what changes might be produced by shifting the spacing of the crystals and found they could simulate and explain the colour changes. Further bolstering the idea that crystals in skin cells are responsible for the animal’s transformation, they compared a sample of ‘relaxed’ chameleon skin with another when the animal was excited and observed a change in the crystal pattern. Professor Michel Milinkovitch, of the university, told the BBC: ‘Chameleons invented something completely new in evolution. ‘They split the iridophores into two layers, one that is specialised for colour change... and one to reduce the amount of energy absorbed by the animal. ‘That's an amazing toolkit that allows them to choose between being hidden or displaying very spectacular colours for communication - and on top of that they have this ability to control their temperature because of the deep iridophores.’","University of Geneva researchers studied panther chameleons .

"Ed Balls was accused of having ‘lost his marbles’ yesterday after painting an ‘apocalyptic’ picture of Britain under another five years of Conservative government. The Shadow Chancellor launched a Labour dossier suggesting three Government departments – the Foreign Office, Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Transport – would ‘disappear’ if the Tories kept cutting spending at the current rate. Later however, Mr Balls was forced to admit that even he did not believe the Foreign Office would be abolished. Scroll down for video . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls (pictured at a conference yesterday) has been accused of having ‘lost his marbles’ after painting an ‘apocalyptic’ picture of Britain under another five years of a Tory government . The Tories said their plan to eliminate the deficit was necessary and accused Mr Balls of ‘absurd scaremongering’. The 31-page Labour document painted a bleak picture of life under a Conservative ‘35 per cent state’, a reference to plans to reduce public spending as a proportion of GDP. It suggested police cuts would fuel crime, a third of elderly people who receive state-funded social care would have it stopped and the NHS ‘as we know it’ would cease to exist. George Osborne’s ‘1930s plans’ would also mean the Army being reduced to its smallest size since Cromwell, the dossier suggested. Mr Balls insisted a Conservative Government would have to make £70billion of spending cuts to eliminate the budget deficit by 2017/18. He suggested avoiding some of the ‘extreme cuts’ outlined in the document would be possible only by raising VAT, slashing the NHS budget or imposing charges for healthcare. But he declined to set out how much spending Labour would cut if it regains office, or where the axe would fall. Asked if he ‘seriously believed that the Conservatives will close down the Foreign Office or close down the Department for Transport or close down the Department for Work and Pensions’, Mr Balls said: ‘No I don’t think that.’ When asked why such scenarios were included in the dossier, he said: ‘Because what the document says is if the Government was to do those spending cuts, which are bigger in the next parliament than in this parliament, on the same basis as in this parliament, that would mean closing the Foreign Office and the DWP. We don’t think they’ll do that.’ Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts . The Tories accused Ed Balls (pictured above) of ‘absurd scaremongering’ after he launched a Labour dossier which suggested three Government departments could disappear under the a Conservative government . Even the BBC’s assistant political editor Norman Smith described the scenario as ‘an apocalypse’. A Labour aide added that the document had set out an ‘implausible scenario’ to illustrate the difficulty of the Tories achieving their deficit reduction plan. Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said the analysis was ‘nonsense’. He said his party had pledged to cut £30billion in the next parliament – £13billion from departmental budgets, £12billion from welfare and £5billion from closing tax loopholes. It sounds like the politics of the playground. Former Labour star James Purnell claims he and Ed Miliband aren’t friends any more. The ex-culture minister, now the BBC’s strategy chief, gave an interview saying he had always been close to Mr Miliband. But he later called the London Evening Standard journalist to insist: ‘When I said I was friends with Ed, that’s not completely right. I’m not friends with Ed any more.’ The exchange simultaneously raises questions about the BBC’s left wing ties and sheds light on insecurity among its upper ranks. ‘I think Balls has lost his marbles on this,’ he said. ‘He is making up a set of figures today and I think fairly ludicrously already having to back track from his speech in which he claimed the next Conservative government would be closing down major government departments. ‘That’s a sign of how chaotic Labour is.’ Mr Balls insisted that to achieve a budget surplus by the end of the next parliament, Mr Osborne would have to deliver ‘colossal cuts’ to public spending. ‘An unprecedented £70billion of spending cuts would be deeply destructive and close to impossible, even for this Chancellor,’ he said. ‘So George Osborne must surely have an alternative plan in his back pocket. These would lead to the smallest police force since comparable records began, the smallest Army since Cromwell, and over a third of older people receiving social care losing their entitlement to it. ‘There is a real risk that the Chancellor will be forced to break his promise to ring-fence the NHS.’ Labour has committed to only tiny spending cuts such as removing the winter fuel allowance from the richest pensioners. Treasury minister David Gauke said yesterday: ‘Ed Balls has today confirmed Labour’s policy of billions of pounds of tax rises, more borrowing and more debt.’ Labour's doom-laden dossier says the Tories’ ‘extreme plans’ would mean £70billion in cuts and have a ‘crushing impact’ on public services. James Chapman gives his verdict. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls . END OF THE NHS . CLAIM: Labour said Tory plans are ‘so extreme as to make them close to impossible to deliver while maintaining current projections for areas such as the NHS... a 35 per cent state is not compatible with an NHS as we know it. If the Tories were to abandon the ring-fence, this could lead to £10billion being cut from the NHS budget.’ REALITY: The Conservative-led Coalition has repeatedly protected NHS spending from cuts – despite complaints that this has meant more painful reductions elsewhere – and repeated a pledge to ensure real-terms increases until 2020. Elsewhere in the world, the worst health cuts have come in countries that failed to control public spending – such as Portugal, Greece and Italy. FOREIGN OFFICE CLOSED . CLAIM: If cuts fell on government departments on the same basis as they did in this parliament, three of them – the Foreign Office, Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Transport – would ‘cease to exist’. REALITY: Even Ed Balls admitted this scenario was absurd. Questioned afterwards, he said: ‘I don’t think they’re going to abolish the Foreign Office ... I don’t think they’re going to abolish the Department for Transport.’ POLICE CUT TO 1970S LEVELS . CLAIM: In the next parliament, Mr Balls said Tory plans ‘would be equivalent to 29,900 police officers lost and 6,700 PCSOs [police community support officers] lost’. This would take the overall numbers of police on the streets well below 100,000 and well below the levels of the late 1970s. REALITY: Crime is the best illustration of the Conservative mantra that it is possible to do ‘more for less in public services’. Despite Labour’s warning in 2010 that Home Secretary Theresa May was taking ‘huge risks with the public’s safety’ by cutting police funding, crime is down by more than a fifth. SMALLEST ARMY IN 350 YEARS . CLAIM: Labour suggested Tory plans would mean ‘the smallest Army since Cromwell’. There would be 34,500 fewer soldiers and 60,800 fewer personnel, which would ‘fundamentally impact on the UK’s ability to project power around the world at a time when we face multiple threats’. REALITY: Like Labour, the Tories have not guaranteed they will maintain defence spending at the Nato target of 2 per cent of national income, currently met by the UK and only four other Nato countries. But David Cameron has repeatedly pledged the Army will face no further cuts in manpower. He told the Commons in January: ‘As long as I am Prime Minister, the regular Army will stay at its current size.’ ELDERLY DENIED SOCIAL CARE . CLAIM: Labour says it is ‘safe to assume’ that ‘even deeper’ cuts would ‘have to be delivered through further restrictions on eligibility’. It forecasts that the number of older people receiving state-funded social care would fall by 260,000 – a third of the current total. The dossier says services would be withdrawn from people ‘who might struggle with daily living activities such as getting washed or dressed, or making a meal’. REALITY: At the cost of £1.6billion a year to the taxpayer, the Coalition is introducing a cap of £72,000 on the amount people have to contribute towards their own care, and introduced the first national guidelines on who should qualify for free care. Labour has suggested there will be no extra money for social care provided by local authorities under its plans. Ed Balls told the BBC in January: ‘There will be no additional funding for local government unless we can find money from somewhere else, but we have not been able to do that in the case of local government.’","Shadow chancellor says next four years of cuts will be worse than last five .

"Just a few years ago, Lesley Hutchinson was worried her partner Chris Coulter would die in his sleep because of severe breathing problems brought on by his excess weight. Now the couple, from Newcastle upon Tyne, have shed nearly 22 stone between them – with Chris losing more than half his body weight – and have compiled a 'slim list' of things they plan to do to celebrate their amazing achievement. Tipping the scales at 29st 5lbs Chris, 51, suffered with sleep apnoea, which regularly saw him stop breathing in his sleep, and 55-year-old Lesley feared one day he might not wake up. Scroll down for video . Lesley used to fear her partner Chris would die in his sleep due to excessive weight, but the couple went on to lose 22 stone between them . Chris and Lesley Hutchinson pose with lifesize cut outs showcasing how much weight they have each lost . And Lesley weighed 15st 4.5lbs and wore a dress size 22. Since joining Slimming World and losing a combined weight of 21st 11lbs, the pair have been named as the organisation's Couple of the Year 2015. Chris and Lesley, who have been together for 25 years, began to have weight problems around 15 years ago. Chris said: 'We stopped smoking and replaced cigarettes with snacks like crisps, sandwiches and pies. Around the same time we got a second car so didn't need to walk places anymore. 'Then when the kids – I have two daughters and Lesley has one daughter from previous relationships – left home we fell into the habit of eating more takeaways and washing them down with a bottle of wine.' A low point: Chris was left mortified after a wooden chair collapsed underneath him at a family barbecue. At that point, he decided that losing weight was his only option . The couple, pictured before their weightloss, began to have weight problems around 15 years ago when they began to replace cigarettes with snacks . However things changed when, in summer 2010, Chris was left mortified after a wooden chair collapsed beneath him at a family barbecue. The garden furniture broke into pieces and cut into Chris' leg, which became infected with cellulitis and worsened and ulcerated because of his weight. Soon after, Chris suffered further embarrassment when he was unable to fit into a hotel shower and the couple had to request a new room. So when his doctor, who was a Slimming World member herself, recommended Chris join his local group in May 2011, he decided losing weight was his only option. Chris, pictured before his weight loss, used to eat 3 or 4 slices of toast with butter or a sausage sandwich with tomato sauce just for breakfast . Chris, pictured at 29st 5lbs on a camping holiday, regularly stopped breathing in his sleep . Chris said: 'My leg was in a real mess and it was getting to the point where they didn't know what else to do, I started to worry that I might actually lose my leg. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight. I was embarrassed and worried because I thought I'd be the only man in a roomful of women, so Lesley agreed to come with me. 'As soon as we walked through the doors though, we were warmly welcomed and made to feel comfortable – it was nothing like we'd expected. Now I can't wait to go to group every week.' Lesley lost 4st 9lbs, going from 15st 4.5lbs to 10st 9.5lbs, and dropped from a dress size 22 to a 12 . Chris and Lesley, holding an old pair of Chris's jeans - he has since dropped 32 inches from his waist . The pair began following Slimming World's Food Optimising programme and swapped their regular takeaways for healthy home-cooked meals, including their favourite Friday night dinner of homemade cheese burgers and Slimming World-style chips (baked in the oven). In his first week Chris lost 8.5lbs and since then he has gone on to lose a total of 17st 2lbs, going from 29st 5lbs to 12st 3lbs, and dropped 32 inches from his waist. His health problems are gone and he's discovered a passion for healthy eating: 'Our tastes have changed completely since we started slimming. 'We don't even want the foods we used to enjoy because the meals that we make at home are so much nicer. The pair joined Slimming World's programme and swapped their unhealthy diets for home-cooked meals. Chris shed a total of 17st 2lb and Lesley lost 4st 9lbs . 'I've learned so much about healthy eating, and I wanted to share that so I'm in the process of setting up a healthy catering company.' Meanwhile Lesley, who works for a children's charity, has lost 4st 9lbs, going from 15st 4.5lbs to 10st 9.5lbs, and dropped from a dress size 22 to a 12 to fit into her first pair of jeans for more than 20 years. Breakfast: 3 or 4 slices of toast with butter or a sausage sandwich with tomato sauce . Lunch: Pasties, pies or sandwiches with either crisps or chips . Dinner: Spaghetti bolognese with cheese on top and a garlic bread baguette, a takeaway from the local chip shop or a pizza . Snacks: Crisps, sandwiches, cheese and biscuits, pasties . She says the couple are much more active thanks to their weight loss, especially with their four grandchildren: 'We go camping in Wales every year. Before we used to just sit in our extra-large camping chairs and watch the kids running around. 'Now we're running around with them, swimming with them, and it's much more fun. It's really important to us because you don't get those times back.' Chris and Lesley are also keen walkers and have climbed the highest peak in Mid Wales twice, and Chris enjoys cycling and finds a round of golf much easier nowadays. In fact, the pair have so much more energy that they decided to compile a 'slim list' of places they'd like to visit and things they'd like to do minus their extra 21st 11lbs, which includes travelling to Paris, Venice and Dublin and re-visiting the Royal Albert Hall so that they can fit comfortably into the seats. Lesley says: 'We'd never been abroad as a couple, we wouldn't have dreamed of trying to go on a plane because Chris would never have fit into the seats. Chris, pictured before his weight loss, said he would dine on spaghetti bolognese with cheese on top and a garlic bread baguette, a takeaway from the local chip shop or a pizza for dinner . At his heaviest, 51-year-old Chris was 29st 5lb, but went on to lose more than half his original body weight (right). He now tips the scales at 12 stone 3lb . 'Now we've been to Venice and to Paris and we had a brilliant time. It's like a whole new world has opened up for us. 'Before we lost weight we didn't have a life, we just sat around the house. We didn't really go anywhere or do anything, we didn't enjoy ourselves. Now things are completely different. Breakfast: Porridge with berries or a full English breakfast (grilled instead of fried) Mid-morning: A piece of fresh fruit . Lunch: Homemade soup or jacket potato topped with beans and salad . Mid-afternoon: A fat-free yogurt and another piece of fruit . Dinner: Homemade cheese burger with Slimming World-style chips (baked in the oven), peas and pickles or a homemade curry with rice. Snacks: Fresh fruit, fat-free yogurts, homemade frittata, scotch eggs and onion bhajis . 'My only regret is that we didn't do something sooner. I'd been worried about Chris' health for a long time and I dread to think how bad it might have got, but I didn't say anything because I thought it was kinder not to upset him.

"A man has been fined £250 for leaving rubbish in the alleyway behind his house because he claims the council failed to give him a wheelie bin. Kyle Tatton said he had nowhere to put his household waste for five months after Stoke-on-Trent City Council failed to provide him with a bin. The 24-year-old claims he told his local authority about the matter in October 2014 but only received a wheelie bin earlier this month. Kyle Tatton, 24, was fined £250 for leaving rubbish in the alleyway behind his house because he claims the council failed to give him a wheelie bin . He had argued that during those five months he had no alternative but to dispose of bin bags at the back of his home in Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. However, the council disagreed and said they had delivered the bin as soon as they could, and Kyle was hauled before magistrates charged with fly-tipping. Yesterday at Stafford Magistrates' Court he admitted the charge and was fined £35, ordered to pay £200 costs and a £20 surcharge. 'I told the council I hadn't got a wheelie bin in October and they said I would have to dispose of the rubbish,' he said today. 'I haven't got a car to take it to the tip. What was I meant to do with it? I had no alternative but to leave it in the alley at the back of my house. 'They only got me the bin just before I went to court so it would look better for them. It's a disgrace.' The court heard Stoke-on-Trent City Council had received complaints about black bin bags, cardboard and blankets piling up in the alleyway. Correspondence found inside the bags linked the waste to Tatton, who was interviewed last October. He admitted to officers that he had put out the waste but said it was only because he did not have a wheelie bin. The council said that a request for a bin was only logged in February. Tatton argued that between October and earlier this month he had no alternative but to dispose of bin-bags in this alleyway at the back of his home in Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire . The court heard Stoke-on-Trent City Council had received complaints about black bin bags, cardboard and blankets piling up in the alleyway . Councillor Andy Platt, the city council's cabinet member for green enterprises and clean city, said: 'Our records show we received Mr Tatton's request for a bin in February this year and delivered the bin in March. 'We receive hundreds of orders each month for new or replacement bins; we delivered the replacement bin as soon as possible given the number of requests we deal with. 'Not having a wheelie bin is not an excuse to dump rubbish outside your property, and we welcome the conviction, fine and costs imposed by the court. 'Dumping rubbish in the open, even in bags, can quickly bring down the appearance of an area and lead to other problems, including vermin and further fly-tipping.' Steven Pritchard, chairman of Portland and Century Residents' Association, added: 'The council does seem to be cracking down on dumped rubbish but why should anyone have to wait weeks for a wheelie bin?'","Kyle Tatton, 24, claims he requested a bin in October but got one in March .

"A woman with a prosthetic leg is fighting back after a neighbor left a scathing note on her car when she complained they had parked in her reserved space. Ashley Brady, 26, has had to learn how to walk again after losing her right leg in an accident last summer and during the recent snowstorm, she struggled to cross the parking lot. So her apartment complex in Miamisburg, Ohio created a handicapped parking spot  at the bottom of the steps to her home. But on Saturday, two days after the spot was designated for handicapped people only, she found another car there with no placard displayed in its window, WKEF reported. Shock: Ashley Brady, who lost her leg in an accident last year, found a threatening note beneath her windshield after she complained to a neighbor that they had parked in her disabled parking spot . Cruel: The note, which called her 'Handicap', told Brady to keep her hands off the person's car . So she left a note pointing out the error and warning the driver that their car would be towed if they left it there again. She was stunned when she found a note under her own windshield. 'Hey handicap! First, never place your hands on my car again! Second, honey you ain't the only one with ""struggles."" You want pity go to a one leg support group! You messed with the wrong one! I don't care what your note said shove it, but you touch my car again I will file a report, I am not playing! I let the office know the cry baby one leg touches my property I will cause trouble so go cry your struggles to someone who cares cause I'm walking away with both mine! - B****.' 'Hey handicap!' it read. 'First, you never place your hands on my car again! Second, honey you ain't the only one with ""struggles"".' The letter instructed Brady to go to 'a one leg support group' if she wanted pity and warned that the police would be contacted if Brady touched her car again. 'I let the office know the cry baby one leg touches my property I will cause trouble so go cry your struggles to someone who cares cause I'm walking away with both mine!' the letter read. Brady said she was so shocked by how rude the note was that she had to read it several times to process it. Her sister then posted a picture of the note to Facebook to highlight the struggles faced by people with disabilities and it has since been shared more than 1,600 times. Life-changing: Brady said she was relieved to get her own space because of the recent icy weather . New life: Brady shows her prosthetic, which has helped her walk again after losing her leg last summer . On the Facebook post, hundreds of people have given their support to Brady, calling for the writer of the note to be reported to the police or have their car towed. Brady quipped: 'She told me to cry to someone who cares, so I went to the internet and it turns out a lot of people care.' After receiving the note, Brady filed a grievance with the Miamisburg police and notified the management of her apartment complex. The managers said they have not yet decided on a course of action.","Ashley Brady, from Ohio, lost her leg after an accident last summer .

"Tributes continue to flow for the two Australians killed when Germanwings flight 4U 9525 lost altitude and crashed into a remote region of the French Alps. Carol Friday and her son Greig, both from Victoria, were killed when the passenger jet, en route from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight on Tuesday. New photos of the 29-year-old have emerged, showing him as a political activist who campaigned for equality. Scroll down for videos . Carol Friday and her son Greig, both from Victoria, were killed when the passenger jet, enroute from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight . Greig, who was to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering . A statement from the Friday family said Greig was 'a man who loved others and life with a full heart' Greig's Facebook page is now serving as memorial to a caring young man, with posts on climate change, world heritage, and gay rights issues. Greig's former manager at Jacob's engineering Sarah Alper said staff have been left devastated, according to SBS News. 'It's really devastating because our memory of him is that he was so happy and so excited about his adventure. It is just really sad.' Carol, a nurse for more than 40 years, had dedicated her life to helping others. Lisa Fitzpatrick from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation said Carol's work with both Indigenous and refugee communities was testament to her generous spirit. 'She's worked with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. She's a woman who's demonstrated that her social perspective in helping others is not something she's just done in her working life but she has certainly been involved with working with refugees when they came from Kosovo to Australia back in the late 90s,' she said. The Friday family issued a statement through Foreign Minister Julie Bishop  saying they were in 'deep disbelief and crippled with sadness' over the death of the 68-year-old nurse and 29-year-old engineer. 'They were both extraordinary and exceptional people who were loved by many, who they loved in return. They will forever be with us in our hearts, memories and dreams,' it read. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Prime Minister Tony Abbott both offered their condolences to the family of the two Australian victims . Mrs Friday, who turned 68 just two days ago, was on a holiday with her son who was planning to remain in Europe so he could teach English. Greig, who was about to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering. 'He also loved to travel and had just completed a course for teaching English as a foreign language, which he was hoping to do in France in the coming year,' the family said. 'Greig was a man who loved others and life with a full heart.' His mother was described as a devoted wife to her husband Dave and loving mother to Greig and daughter Alex. She was a registered nurse and midwife who regularly travelled. 'Carol loved life! She enjoyed every minute with her family and friends,' her family said. 'She was a talented artist and enjoyed spending time creating with her local art group. She loved to travel and has seen many of the world's greatest sights. 'Carol and Greig were enjoying a few weeks holiday together at the start of his European stay.' The news came as the first pictures of some of those lost emerged - and search teams recovered the black box from the crash site, where wreckage, bodies and personal belongings were strewn across a large area on the mountainside. Part of the writing on the fuselage of the plane is visible on a piece of the wreckage (centre) on the mountainside . 'I don't think it gets any easier announcing the death of Australian citizens in a tragedy overseas,' Ms Bishop said. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this shocking tragedy. We extend our condolences to the governments of Germany, France and Spain and their people who appear to have borne the brunt of this tragedy.' Ms Bishop's prayers were echoed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. 'This incident will be a very painful reminder of other disasters in recent times - whether it's MH370 or MH17 - this will be a very raw moment for many Victorian families who have had to live through those tragedies just in the space of the last 12 months,' Mr Andrews said.","Carol Friday, 68, and her son Greig  among the 150 people killed in crash .

"Prince Charles has praised the way his wife has tackled the challenge of joining the royal family as ‘brilliant’ ahead of their 10th wedding anniversary next month. The heir to the throne also highlighted the Duchess of Cornwall’s ‘charm and charisma’ in an unusually affectionate television interview. Since marrying the prince in 2005, Camilla – once one of the most hated women in Britain - has gone from being a middle-aged mother who lived much of her life out of the spotlight, to taking on a range of charitable patronages and learning about the rigours of royal engagements. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles highlighted the Duchess of Cornwall's 'charm and charisma' during a television interview .

Above, the couple share a private moment . Wedding day: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall pictured after the ceremony on April 9 2005 . In an interview with CNN’s Max Foster ahead of the couple’s joint tour of the US next week, Charles was asked: ‘People cannot believe it's been 10 years. ‘And in that time the Duchess of Cornwall has defined her own public role as well, hasn't she? ‘Has that been a challenge?’ The prince, who was interviewed at Birkhall, his home next to the Queen's Balmoral estate, replied: ‘You can imagine it is a real, real challenge. ‘But she's, I think, been brilliant in the way she's tackled these things.’ The future king, who has rarely spoken publicly in detail about his relationship with Camilla, was also asked about her ‘powerful’ charm and humour. ‘It's a side that doesn't always come across on television, but it's, it's pretty powerful in real life, isn't it?’ his interviewer said. Charles replied: ‘Yes, I think so. ‘It's a peculiar thing ... sometimes the camera ... but also, inevitably perhaps a bit more relaxed when it's, when it's slightly more private or when you're meeting people without being totally surrounded all the time by the dreaded camera.’ Royal visit: The couple (pictured together) will travel to the US next week to meet President Obama and undertake a series of official engagements in Washington and Kentucky . Charles and Camilla began dating in the early 1970s but the prince was said to be ‘heartbroken’ when Camilla married cavalry officer Andrew Parker Bowles after he ‘dithered’ about their future. Charles went on to marry Lady Diana Spencer in 1981 but within a few years their marriage imploded. The prince resumed his affair with his former mistress Camilla while Diana turned to a string of lovers including cavalry officer James Hewitt. Throughout the early 1990s the couple undertook a series of carefully planned public appearances designed to cultivate public acceptance of their relationship. These culminated in their wedding in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall on April 9 2005, since when Camilla has taken her place by her husband’s side on the world stage. Prince Charles has rarely spoken publicly in detail about his relationship with Camilla (pictured with her children Tom, right, and Laura, left, at the Cheltenham Festival on Wednesday) Charles and Camilla began dating in the early 1970s.

"Together: Sacha Newly with his mother Joan Collins in 1999. He described her as a 'narcissist' As Alexis Carrington in the glossy soap opera Dynasty, she was a difficult and controlling mother. But Dame Joan Collins’ portrayal may have been closer to life than audiences realised, according to her only son. Sacha Newley, 49, said he loves the 81-year-old actress ‘deeper than I can process’ but added that he had a strained childhood relationship with her and described her as a ‘narcissist’ who ‘abandoned’ him and his sister Tara, 51. The portrait painter also said: ‘Her life still seems far too dramatic. Too much is happening. She is always dealing with some disaster. As much as she says she longs for a peaceful life, I don’t think she could handle it.’ Mr Newley, whose father was Dame Joan’s second husband, the actor and singer Anthony Newley, has described his early life in a yet to be published memoir, Hollywood Child; the rights have been bought by a film producer. ‘My mother wasn’t a monster, she was a narcissist,’ he said in an interview with the Sunday Times. ‘I can’t remember her hugging me, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. ‘I just wanted mummy to love me, and I wanted a connection with the mummy I found so overwhelming and so dazzling. She nourished me in a way a muse nourishes; at a distance.’ He claimed his mother handed over care of her two children to a nanny because she was ‘overwhelmed’ by being a mother, leading him to feel she had abandoned him. Mr Newley puts his mother’s alleged coldness down to her difficult relationship with her own father. ‘It’s true to say my mother didn’t receive a great deal of affection from her father,’ he said. ‘He was a glacier. My mother didn’t get physical warmth from her father and a girl needs that.’ With his mother and sister Tara in 1968 (left) and with Joan Collins at Heathrow Airport when he was 17 (right) Mother and son at Buckingham Palace in 1997 as she collected her OBE. Mr Newly has revealed they had a strained childhood relationship and he felt abandoned after she left him in the care of a nanny . He also revealed his unusual relationship with the nanny, Sue Delong, who later committed suicide after being fired from a series of jobs. He said how he would get almost sexual gratification from her physical methods of disciplining him. He said: ‘There was a lot of S&M. She wouldn’t just sit on me, but sit and grind me into the carpet. It was like the relationship boys might have with their older brothers, but in my case it was with a woman who was employed, so it had a different frisson about it.’ Mr Newly with his father, Anthony Newly, Joan's second husband (left) and at his mother's book launch (right) The portrait painter also revealed his unusual relationship with the nanny, Sue Delong, who later committed suicide after being fired from a series of jobs . Mr Newley said that he and his mother – who married fifth husband Percy Gibson, 49, in 2002 – are currently ‘recalibrating’ their relationship and have frequent lunches so they can talk. He also gave his assessment of his father, who died in 1999. While describing him as a musical genius, ‘the third in the holy trinity of Sinatra and Sammy Davis’, he put his father’s comparative lack of success down to his womanising. Asked for a comment yesterday, a spokesman for Dame Joan said she had been told by her son that the Sunday Times interview was ‘sensationalised’.","Sacha Newly, 49, said he loves his 81-year-old actress mother in interview .

"The Tories are planning to repeat the 'Labour tax bombshell' campaign that won them the 1992 general election. David Cameron will argue Labour has £15billion of unexplained tax cuts, having voted to back Government plans to save £30billion over five years. Yesterday, the Prime Minister torpedoed Labour's central economic attack by categorically ruling out a rise in VAT. Asked by Ed Miliband at the final Prime Minister's Questions before polling day whether he would rule out a rise in VAT, he replied: 'The answer is yes.' The announcement left Mr Miliband, who appeared unprepared for the 'straight answer' he had demanded, floundering. Scroll down for video . Labour MPs sat stony-faced as Tory MPs roared with laughter when Mr Cameron ruled out a VAT increase . Labour had planned to make the possibility of a Tory VAT rise a key part of the election campaign. It has already drawn up billboards featuring a swinging block of concrete in the shape of the letters VAT. Mr Cameron then challenged Mr Miliband to rule out the prospect of Labour raising national insurance contributions, which it did in 2002. The Labour leader repeatedly declined to do so, saying the Tories would have 'plenty of time to ask questions' after polling day on May 7. However, within two hours of PMQs finishing, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls issued a different message. 'We will make it clear in the manifesto Labour will not be raising national insurance. That will be a clear pledge from us,' Mr Balls said. Later he ruled out any increase in either the basic or higher rate of income tax. 'We have clear pledges. No rise in VAT under Labour, no rise in the basic and higher rates of income tax under Labour, no rise in national insurance under Labour,' Mr Balls said. 'Our plans add up, theirs don't. As night follows day, if people vote Tory VAT will go up. It always does and it will again.' Conservative sources suggested the party had set a trap for Mr Miliband because Chancellor George Osborne had repeatedly refused to rule out a rise in VAT under questioning from Labour MPs. 'Labour has been panicked today into ruling out tax rises left, right and centre,' said a senior official. 'So where is the £15billion tax bombshell going to fall? It is a safe bet that this is going to feature heavily in our campaign.' Conservative sources said the party had set a trap for Mr Miliband because Chancellor George Osborne two days ago (pictured) declined to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT . In an echo of slogans in the 1992 election campaign, when John Major defied the polls to win a majority, Mr Cameron said: 'We know there is a tax bombshell coming from Labour … It would wreck our economy.' The issue is likely to figure in the first leaders' TV interviews of the election campaign tonight, when Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband face a grilling from Jeremy Paxman and Kay Burley on Channel 4 and Sky News. The Tories have claimed they do not intend to raise any taxes, instead saving £13billion from the budgets of Government departments, £12billion from cutting the benefits bill and £5billion from measures to squeeze tax avoidance. However, they have to find £7billion to fund two tax pledges by the end of the next parliament – an increase in the personal allowance for income tax to £12,500 and the threshold for the 40p rate rising to £50,000. The announcements from the Conservatives and Labour severely restrict the room for manoeuvre of both on taxation after the next election because VAT and national insurance raise huge amounts for the Treasury. Raising significant sums elsewhere might require new taxes on businesses. Mr Miliband insisted 'nobody would believe' Mr Cameron's pledge and Labour officials said the party would press ahead with its billboard campaign. They pointed out that Mr Cameron had said before the last election that he had 'no plans' to raise VAT. Mr Osborne raised VAT from 17.5 to 20 per cent in his emergency budget in June 2010. Labour said the Tories had made a similar pledge before the 1992 election, only to break it a year later. Last night, Mr Cameron was cheered as he addressed the last meeting of the backbench 1922 committee of this parliament. 'We've got the song, we've got the tune, we've got the lines, we've got the policies,' the Prime Minister said. 'So let's get out there and sing about it. Let's get out there and win.'","The Tories are planning to repeat 'Labour tax bombshell' of 1992 election .

"Nicola Sturgeon is behaving like Vladimir Putin by 'stoking division in England', a senior Tory warns. In a provocative intervention, Ben Wallace last night accused Scotland's First Minister of trying to break up Britain using the same tactics as the Russian president in the early days of the Ukraine crisis. Miss Sturgeon will use her keynote speech at the SNP's conference in Glasgow today to insist that she will 'demand an end to slash and burn austerity' in return for propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street. A senior Tory  has said Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (right) is behaving like Russia's Vladimir Putin (left) by 'stoking division in England' She will claim to be sending a 'message of friendship and solidarity' to English voters who want an end to spending cuts that 'tear at the very fabric of society'. But Mr Wallace, a serving government whip who was once a Member of the Scottish Parliament, last night accused her of masterminding a plot designed to anger English voters and hasten the break-up of the UK. 'Nicola Sturgeon is intent on stoking division in England in the same way Putin used it to break apart Ukraine,' he said. 'I'm talking about the early days in the Ukraine crisis, before the tanks, when he spread division and fear in order for it to splinter apart. 'Separatists all over the world use division and nationalism to break up countries. Sturgeon may dress it up as friendliness, but that is what she wants – she wants England to tell the Scots to get lost. 'Labour could stop this if Miliband said he would not proceed with legislation... that could not get through without SNP votes. But if Labour's greed for power allows her to succeed, then God help the UK.' Miss Sturgeon has previously provoked anger by saying she would 'lock the Tories out' of Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament – even if they win the most seats. Miss Sturgeon has said she has no qualms about installing Mr Miliband (pictured) in No 10 . She said she would have no qualms about installing Mr Miliband in No 10, despite believing that Scotland should not even be part of the UK. But she warned she would push for 'an end to austerity and the non-renewal of Trident' in return. Treasury figures show the SNP's plans would involve an extra £148billion of spending – leading to higher borrowing and taxes. However polls predict the party could win more than 50 of Scotland's 59 seats at the election – and could potentially prop up a minority Labour government. Miss Sturgeon will claim today that her party's Left-wing stance appeals to millions of voters in England. She will tell activists: 'To ordinary people across these islands who feel just as let down by the out of touch Westminster system as we do, I have a very clear message. 'It is a message of friendship and solidarity. As long as Scotland remains part of the Westminster system, we will be your allies in seeking to reform that outdated system. 'So to people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, I make this promise. The SNP stands ready to work with you. We will demand an alternative to slash and burn austerity.' Former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth accused Miss Sturgeon of 'arrogance' for boasting that she could hand power to Labour even if it loses the election. He said: 'We have had the Scottish referendum, which she lost, and now she wants to dictate policy to England – what arrogance. The SNP has demonstrated that it is deeply socialist – far worse even than Labour.' He said it would be 'catastrophic' for the UK if the SNP held the balance of power, as it would lead to 'more spending and borrowing, higher taxes and weaker defences'. Fellow Tory Michael Ellis said Labour appeared to have been 'taken hostage' by the SNP. 'It is quite clear that Alex Salmond will ride roughshod over Miliband and hold him to ransom for a very high price.'","Senior Tory accuses Scotland's First Minister of 'stoking division' in Britain .

"House prices are up 5.1 per cent on a year ago, a report has revealed - but growth is still slowing and some areas are even in decline. Average UK property values in March reached £189,454 in March compared to £187,964 in February 2014, according to Nationwide Building Society. But the annual pace of house price growth has been slowing for seven months in a row, and has reached less than half the rate of growth seen for much of last summer, when the year-on-year increase was in double digits. A report has revealed house prices are up 5.1 per cent across Britain - but growth has been slowing for seven months in a row . Last June, prices were climbing at a rate of 11.8 per cent year-on-year. On a month-on-month basis, house prices edged up by 0.1 per cent in March, following a 0.1 per cent decrease in February. Nationwide said that all regions except the North of England have seen a further slowing in the annual pace of house price growth during the first three months of this year. London remains the strongest-performing region, with average prices up by 12.7 per cent year on year, taking them to £408,780 on average. But the pace of price growth in the capital has slowed sharply compared with the end of 2014, when the pace of annual growth was 17.8 per cent. Wales remains the weakest area in the UK for annual house price growth. At £139,171 on average, prices in Wales are down by 0.5 per cent year on year. Despite seeing a rise in the average cost of a house, the pace of price growth in London has slowed sharply compared with the end of 2014 . St Albans (pictured) in Hertfordshire was named as the UK's top performing city for house prices over the last year, with average values up by 22 per cent to reach £498,957 . Average UK property values in March reached £189,454 in March compared to £187,964 in February 2014 . Wales is the only UK nation or region where prices have fallen year on year in the first quarter of 2015. St Albans in Hertfordshire was named as the UK's top performing city for house prices over the last year, with average values up by 22 per cent to reach £498,957. Manchester was named as the weakest performing city, with values down by 1 per cent year on year, taking them to £211,571. Reading, Oxford, London and Brighton were among the UK's other top price performers over the last year, while Bradford, Plymouth, Leicester and Cardiff were among the weakest. In Scotland, house prices have increased by 1.3 per cent year on year, taking them to £140,180 on average, and in Northern Ireland they have increased by 5.7 per cent, pushing them to £121,052 typically. The North of England has bucked the general trend seen across the UK, seeing the annual pace of price growth accelerate from 4.4 per cent at the end of last year to 4.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. The average house price in the North of England is £125,299. On the market: London remains the strongest-performing region, with average prices up by 12.7 per cent year on year, taking them to £408,780 on average . Yorkshire and Humberside was the weakest performing region in England, with prices up by 1.3 per cent over the last year, pushing prices there to £141,647 typically. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that, across the UK, average house prices are currently around 2 per cent above the levels seen before the financial crisis. He said: 'Economic conditions have remained supportive, with labour market conditions continuing to improve and mortgage interest rates close to all-time lows. 'Nevertheless, the pace of housing market activity has remained subdued, with the number of mortgages approved for house purchase in January around 20 per cent below the level prevailing one year ago.' Some experts have suggested that the looming general election could have an impact on the housing market, with people putting off their plans to await the outcome. The annual pace of house price growth has been slowing for seven months in a row, and has reached less than half the rate of growth seen for much of last summer . But a report from the British Bankers' Association (BBA) found this week that the number of mortgage approvals being made to home-buyers is starting to see an upward trend. The BBA said that early 2015 is seeing a higher demand for mortgages than the levels seen towards the end of last year. The reform of stamp duty in December has made the tax cheaper for the majority of home-buyers who are liable to pay it. Meanwhile, estate agents have reported receiving inquiries from older people who are considering investing in the buy-to-let market, due to the new pension freedoms which will come into force in April and give people aged 55 and over a greater level of choice over how they use their pension pots. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist for IHS Global Insight, said: 'There are signs that housing market activity may now be slowly turning around after weakening during much of 2014 and we suspect it will gradually improve over the coming months.'","Average UK property values in March reached £189,454, Nationwide reveals .

"A mother and her three children were killed when a small plane she was flying crashed in a field in northwestern France yesterday. The 39-year-old woman, said to be an experienced flyer, had rented the aircraft from a nearby flying club and was with her two daughters and son, aged 13, 11 and nine. Pictures taken at the crash site today capture the twisted and broken remains of the aircraft, which went down near a farm in the small town of Vrigny, near Argentan. Tragic: The 39-year-old mother and her three children, aged 13, 11 and nine, were all killed in the crash . Twisted wreckage: Bent and broken pieces of metal and plastic are seen at the crash site today . The alarm was raised at around 5.30pm after a witness saw the plane falling from the sky and rescue teams discovered the wreckage around 40 minutes later. The plane, a Robin DR 400 which belonged to the Argentan flying club, suffered catastrophic damage in the accident and an investigation into the cause of the crash is now underway, reports Corsematin. A police spokesman said: 'The alert was given by a witness. The plane was found at 6:10pm in the municipality of Vrigny.' A local official, Hugues de Phily, told Corsematin: 'I do not know what the trajectory of the plane was. The debris is all over the place. Unexplained: The aircraft went down in the town of Vrigny, near Argentan, and an investigation into the cause of the crash is now underway . 'It's difficult to say how the plane was going. Mum was in the front.' Mr de Phily said that flying conditions were good and added that the investigation was being entrusted to the research section of the aviation police, who are at the crash site today. The mother of the family was believed to be an seasoned flyer, having flown planes for ten years. The children's father was in severe shock after hearing the devastating news and was being treated at a hospital in Argentan last night, reports France Bleu. The plane was rented from the Argentan flying club and crashed in the town of Vrigny . Emergency services were alerted by a witness who saw the aircraft fall from the sky at around 5.50 pm .

"Lee Smith (pictured) had sex with a female pupil on her 15th birthday before embarking on a four-year relationship with her. He has now been jailed . A teacher who got engaged to a former pupil and fathered a baby wit her when she left school has been jailed after he admitted having sex with her when she was just 15. Lee Smith, 38, of Bedworth, Warwickshire, also fabricated details on job applications to three schools in the early 2000s, before he was employed as an IT and drama teacher. While at one of the schools he began texting and emailing a 14-year-old girl in his class. Warick Crown Court heard their relationship progressed and Smith lured the girl into his office where he kissed and touched her. Smith left his wife and moved out of the marital home and the pair arranged to meet at his flat on her 15th birthday - where she lost her virginity to him. The court heard they went on to have a long-term relationship after the victim left the school, getting engaged and having a baby together but broke up when the girl was 19. In 2013 she underwent counselling and finally reported him to the police. When police investigated the girl's complaints they also discovered Smith had lied on his CV when applying for teaching jobs and had inflated his GCSE grades. Smith pleaded guilty to three charges of sexual activity while in a position of trust and three charges of obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception. The court heard the victim's family became concerned by his relationship with their daughter when she was at the school and asked Smith, who was in his mid-20s, to visit their home. He told them nothing inappropriate was happening but soon after his marriage broke down and he moved into a flat on his own. His relationship with the girl then progressed to kissing and touching and they met at his flat where they regularly had sex. Prosecutor Ian Speed said: 'The complainant describes becoming close to Mr Smith especially after she was 14. They then began spending a lot of time together in the defendant's office after school. 'They developed feelings for each other which moved to kissing and touching each other's bodies. 'The relationship continued and then became a fully sexual one. 'On her 18th birthday they became engaged and had a daughter, but the relationship ended in 2005 to 2006, and apart from child contact, they went their separate ways. 'In 2013 she had counselling and that prompted her to contact the police.' Warwick Crown Court (pictured) heard Smith also fabricated details on job applications to three schools . Matthew Barnes, defending, said: 'Even though it was late in the day, he did bring his head out of the sand eventually and pleaded guilty at the start of his trial. 'His health is a major feature of everyday life. He was diagnosed with severe epilepsy in 1995. 'He suffers even now from mental absences several times a day and has a 'grand mal' seizure about once a month, as well as having diabetes. 'After the relationship with the girl ended, he didn't embark with another relationship with another underage girl. 'He was emotionally immature and vulnerable, because of the deterioration of his marriage. Recorder Christopher Hotten QC said: 'It is not surprising she felt flattered by your interest in her and eventually felt herself to be in love with you. 'The burgeoning of this relationship was all too apparent to your wife and her parents. 'They all tried to discourage you and warn you off, but you lied to them and pursued the relationship behind their backs. 'You left it up to the victim to choose when you first had sex but in reality sex was inevitable. 'You had provided misleading information about qualifications and you shouldn't have been a teacher at all. 'You misrepresented your qualifications because you knew you wouldn't get the jobs otherwise.' The recorder added: 'The victim should have been pursuing sport and academic activities both of which she excelled at, but she was concentrating on you. 'She says you discouraged her academic activities and friendships with friends her own age.' Smith was jailed for 18 months for the three sexual offences, to run consecutively with a six-month jail term for the deception charges.","Lee Smith, 38, began texting and emailing a 14-year-old pupil in his class .

"Italian online fashion retailer Yoox bought Net-a-Porter, its upmarket rival, on Tuesday in an all-share deal for stock valued at about 719 million euros ($775 million) to create the world’s biggest online luxury-goods retailer with combined sales of  1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion). Net-a-Porter (NAP) owner Richemont (CFR.VX) will receive 50 percent of the combined Yoox Net-a-Porter Group but its voting rights will be capped at 25 percent, putting Yoox (YOOX.MI) effectively in charge of the combined business. 'Today, we open the doors to the world's biggest luxury fashion store. It is a store that never closes, a store without geographical borders,' said NAP founder Natalie Massenet, who will oversee editorial content and advertising of the new group as executive chairman. NAP founder: 'Today, we open the doors to the world's biggest luxury fashion store. It is a store that never closes, a store without geographical borders,' said NAP founder Natalie Massenet . Biggest online luxury retailer: Italian online fashion retailer Yoox has bought Net-a-Porter, its upmarket rival, in an all-share deal that creates an industry leader in the booming online luxury market . Yoox boss, founder and minority shareholder Federico Marchetti will become chief executive and shape strategy. 'Between us, we have changed the fashion industry somehow and we will continue to change it,' Marchetti told journalists in a conference call on Tuesday. The online luxury goods industry is still in its infancy, making up only around 5 percent of total luxury sales because many brands put off Internet expansion, worrying it would not offer customers the same high-end experience as their stores. The online luxury goods industry is still in its infancy, making up only around 5 percent of total luxury sales because many brands put off Internet expansion, worrying it would not offer customers the same high-end experience as their stores. But many executives now believe the Internet will be key to driving future sales, particularly among the so-called Millennials, web-savvy customers born between 1980 and 2000. Net-a-Porter stock: Yoox SpA agreed to buy Cie. Financiere Richemont SA’s Net-a-Porter business for stock valued at about 719 million euros ($775 million) to create the world’s biggest online luxury-goods retailer . Yoox stock: Yoox shares, which gained already nearly 10 percent on Monday after Yoox and Richemont confirmed the new purchase, values Yoox at 1.56 billion euros . Online luxury is not yet very profitable: Both Yoox's and NAP's operating margin is less than 5 percent compared with more than 25 percent for most big luxury brands such as Gucci or Prada. But the pair hope their bigger size will help cut warehouse, logistical, back-office and distribution costs, lifting margins. Yoox operates the online sales of fashion brands such as Ermenegildo Zegna and Kering (PRTP.PA)'s Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent and also sells items at a discount. Analysts said the deal could help boost Yoox's chances of retaining luxury brands that might otherwise have wanted to take their online operations in-house once they gained experience. 'I'm positive on the outlook for the online luxury market. I believe it's a structural change that will gain traction as younger generations of more 'digitally minded' managers get to the top,' said Gian Luca Pacini at Intesa Sanpaolo in Milan. NAP, which is regarded as having helped make online shopping an entertainment experience, specializes in current season and off-the-runway items and advises customers on what to wear them with. It also published the fashion magazine Porter. Luxury moving online: The online luxury goods industry is still in its infancy, making up only around 5 percent of total luxury sales but many executives now believe the Internet will be key to driving future sales . Marchetti said NAP would have the same valuation as Yoox once the deal was completed in September. Analysts valued NAP at around 1.5 billion euros, above Yoox which stood at 1.32 billion euros on Friday before news of the potential deal came out. Yoox shares, which gained already nearly 10 percent on Monday after Yoox and Richemont confirmed Reuters reports they were in talks, were up more than 8 percent by 0501 EDT at 25.14 euros, valuing Yoox at 1.56 billion euros. The combined business will generate adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around 108 million euros in 2014 and annual synergies of around 60 million euros by the third full year, the two companies said. If Yoox shareholders approve the deal in June, the new group will launch a rights issue of around 200 million euros ($216 million) in the fall to fund growth, with Richemont expected to fund around half the sum, a spokesman for the Swiss group said. Marchetti said strategic investors keen to participate in the capital increase could include luxury brands but gave no further details. Richemont has agreed to a lock-up period of three years regarding half of its stake, or 25 percent, which analysts said they would expect the Swiss group to eventually sell. The group will appoint two members of 12-member board. Marchetti, who currently owns over 7 percent of Yoox, said he planned to remain a shareholder.","Italian online fashion retailer Yoox bought Net-a-Porter, its upmarket rival, in an all-share deal for stock valued at about $775 million .

"Opening GP surgeries at weekends would mean two million fewer patients waiting in A&E every year. Research shows the number of visits to casualty has dropped by 8 per cent in areas where patients can see family doctors seven days a week. Academics say there is a huge decrease in the numbers going to emergency departments with mild or moderate ailments such as colds, sprains and back ache. They also believe the NHS should pay GPs more to open routinely at weekends – possibly by using cash saved from the reduction in visits to A&E. Research shows that if GP surgeries were open at weekends would mean two million fewer patients waiting in A&E every year. File photo shows ambulances parked outside St Thomas's Hospital in London . Over the past decade the numbers of patients arriving in casualty has soared by 50 per cent with 21.7million in 2013/14. The rise has partly been blamed on a contract introduced by Labour in 2004 which enabled GPs to opt out of working evenings and weekends. These services are now subcontracted to private firms which patients either do not trust or do not know how to get hold of, instead going to A&E. Professor Peter Dolton, an economics expert at Sussex University, looked at the A&E attendances at Central London Clinical Commissioning Group, an NHS body covering 34 GP practices. Four of the surgeries offer weekend appointments to all patients as part of a Government pilot project launched in 2013. The research found that, on average, the number of patients arriving at A&E dropped by 8 per cent – up to a 10 per cent reduction at weekends. If this were true for all surgeries across England, then an estimated 1.736million fewer patients would have gone to casualty last year. The scheme – called the Prime Minister’s Challenge Fund – involves 1,147 English GP surgeries which were each given a slice of £50million to ensure several practices in the area stay open seven days a week. Draft research by NHS England last month found that, since the scheme was established in Birmingham, the number of A&E patients had dropped by as much as 25 per cent at one practice. Research shows the number of visits to casualty dropped by 8 per cent in areas where patients can see family doctors seven days a week. File photo . They fell by more than 10 per cent in Arden, Herefordshire and Worcestershire and by 10 per cent in North West London. Professor Dolton, speaking at the Royal Society of Economics conference in Manchester, said: ‘It’s having a significant effect on A&E and it’s very important.’ He said the Government should consider giving GPs extra funding to open their surgeries at weekends permanently. The money provided under the current scheme is only a one-off. One way of doing this, he said, would be to use money saved from the reduction in A&E visits which are very costly to the NHS. The average cost of an A&E visit is £114 compared to a GP appointment which is just £25. But Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘For the vast majority, seven-day opening remains an aspiration and telling patients that they can walk into their local surgery in the evenings or at weekends risks raising expectations that general practice cannot live up to with current resources. ‘Investing in longer opening hours may not be the best route to improving care in every area.’","Casualty visits dropped in areas where patients can see doctors every day .

"Dal Babu, who left Metropolitan Police in 2013, said there was a 'lack of knowledge' among officers around race and faith issues . A Muslim former police chief yesterday condemned the government’s flagship anti-radicalisation strategy as a ‘toxic brand’. Dal Babu said most Muslims are suspicious of the Prevent scheme and think it is used for spying on them. The former chief superintendent, who retired from the Metropolitan Police in 2013, said the force's counter-terrorism command was ‘virtually all white’ and insisted there was a ‘lack of knowledge’ among officers around race and faith issues. The Prevent programme, which has an annual budget of £40million, is designed to identify people at risk of being radicalised and potentially turning to terrorism. They are then encouraged to speak to moderate Islamic preachers and turned away from extremism. But the programme has come under scrutiny because of the 600 Britons who are believed to have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State (IS), including the three London schoolgirls who fled the UK last month. Mr Babu, who was chairman of the Association of Muslim Officers within the Met, said: ‘There's been a lot of concern about the Prevent strategy in the Muslim community over the last few years. ‘Prevent was bought in with good intentions but over the years it has alienated the Muslim community who see it as spying. ‘It's a toxic brand in the same way the Big Society idea was brought in but we don't about hear about it much any more.’ Mr Babu called for ‘greater diversity’ in safeguarding boards aimed at protecting children and among senior police figures. ‘It's virtually all white in the counter-terrorism command,’ he said . ‘There's a lack of diversity in the police and, equally important, a lack of diversity in children's services. I'm not aware of a single ethnic minority director of children's services or independent chair of a safeguarding board.’ Anyone who comes under scrutiny as part of Prevent can also see their details shared with counter terrorism officers. Last year it emerged some 77 such reports were passed to the police. Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy defended the scheme and said parents must take responsibility for ensuring their children do not become radicalised. The programme has come under scrutiny because of the 600 Britons who are believed to have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State (IS), including the three London schoolgirls who fled the UK last month (above) Sir Peter said it would ‘obviously help’ to have more Muslims working in the police but defended the programme . ‘Over the past year a number of Muslim leaders have recognised that they need to give a stronger message against extremism and against travel to Syria,’ he said. ‘The prime responsibility for stopping young people thinking of travelling to Syria or other warzones must be with their families and carers, who know them and are able to spot the early signs of radicalisation. ‘I understand it is a difficult challenge for parents between allowing freedom and protecting young people from harmful material on the internet but the responsibility cannot be transferred to schools and the police.’ Sir Peter said it would ‘obviously help’ to have more Muslims working in the police but officers on the Prevent programme had developed an ‘extensive knowledge of minority groups and the different facets of the Muslim religion’, he said. He added: ‘It is difficult to measure success because, in counter-terrorism, success is ultimately that attacks don't take place. Nevertheless thousands of people have received help from projects supported by Prevent following concerns being raised about their behaviour and attitudes.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘As a country, we must consistently challenge the twisted narrative of extremism.’ ‘This Government fundamentally revised the Prevent strategy in 2011 to ensure it challenges terrorist ideology, supports people who are vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism and works with sectors and institutions where there are risks of radicalisation.’ ‘Most importantly, we changed Prevent's objectives so it also deals with non-violent extremism.’","Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent, left Metropolitan Police in 2013 .

"There may still be more to come in the Darren Wilson case. Just days after the Department of Justice released the findings of their probe into the shooting of Michael Brown by Wilson, an officer with the Ferguson Police Department, a member of the Missouri grand jury that decided not to indict Wilson has filed a memorandum hoping to speak publicly about the case. And among other things, the juror claims that Robert McCulloch, the attorney who prosecuted the case, lied to the public. Scroll down for video . An individual filed papers on Friday claiming the prosecutor in the Darren Wilson case, Robert McCulloch (above), misled jurors and lied to the public . The juror says during the Wilson (above) case, McCulloch made it seem as throughout officer was right to shoot Michael Brown . The 21-page memorandum, filed ,on Friday, states that McCulloch was not truthful when during a press conference immediately following the decision he said that 'all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges.' This is just one of the reasons why the juror is asking to be able to speak out about the case. In Missouri, only nine of the twelve jurors are need to make the decision on whether or not to indict an individual. 'This case is about Doe’s First Amendment rights,' said the lawyer for the unnamed juror. 'The claim that a citizen with information on a matter of public concern should be permitted to challenge the government’s narrative without going to jail is a cognizable First Amendment claim.' The papers says McCulloch was not being truthful when he announced the jury all jurors decided not to indict Wilson for shooting Brown (above) The lawyer also noted; 'McCulloch speaks freely and purportedly openly about the very content about which Doe wishes to speak, just from a different viewpoint.' The juror is also claiming in these papers that McCulloch presented evidence over the course of the trial that suggested Brown was the aggressor and Wilson did nothing wrong and was simply acting in self-defense. 'McCulloch has given his view of the grand jurors’ thoughts. The twelve who know the answer are silenced by the challenged laws,' said the juror's attorney.","An individual who served on the grand jury that decided not to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael Brown is fighting to speak publicly .

"If you’re a Saturnian, it’s time to reset your clocks because it’s been discovered that a day lasts just 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds - seven minutes shorter than previously thought. Saturn’s rotation period - the time it takes to rotate once around its axis - has been notoriously difficult to estimate in the past because of the planet’s unique properties. But using measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, scientists have determined a more exact value for a day on the planet. Scientists in Israel have revealed a new estimated rotation speed for the ringed planet (shown). Previously it was thought to rotate in 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22 seconds. But new figure of 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds is more accurate. This is based on measuring its gravitational field, shape and density . The research was carried out by scientists at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft had estimated Saturn's day at 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22.4 seconds in the 1980s. In 2006, astronomers used more advanced equipment to measure the planet's rotation ending up with a measurement of about 10 hours and 47 minutes. But an estimate that was 12 minutes shorter in 2009 only added to the confusion. Mercury: 58 days and 15 hours . Venus: 243 days . Earth: 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds . Mars: 24 hours, 39 minutes, 35 seconds . Jupiter: 9.9 hours . Saturn: 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds . Uranus: 17 hours, 14 minutes and 24 seconds . Neptune: 16 hours, 6 minutes and 36 seconds . The new method, though, provides what might be the most accurate reading so far. Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found. The same formula came up with the correct rotation period of Jupiter - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field. Saturn’s magnetic pole is aligned with its rotational axis and this means - unlike Jupiter - its rotation period cannot be calculated using the magnetic field alone. But verifying the method with Jupiter allowed scientists to apply the same technique to Saturn. Alternative methods such as measuring Saturn’s radio emissions or wind field, or tracking the planet’s clouds, had only served to increase uncertainty and resulted in a rotation period of between 10 hours and 32 minutes and 10 hours and 47 minutes. The same method came up with the correct rotation period of Jupiter (pictured) - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field. Verifying the method with Jupiter allowed scientists to apply the same technique to Saturn and come up with the revised estimate . Scientists used measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, some of which was gathered by the Cassini spacecraft in orbit (artist's illustration shown) ‘The alignment of Saturn’s magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period,’ said planetary scientist Dr Ravit Helled of Tel Aviv University. ‘Here we report a period of 10 hours 32 minutes 45 seconds (plus or minus 46 seconds) based upon an optimisation approach using Saturn’s measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles. ‘To validate our method we applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known rotation period.’ Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found. The study, published online in Nature, could be used in the future to derive the rotation period of other giant planets and planets outside our solar system.","Scientists in Israel have revealed new rotation speed for the ringed planet .

"It is a secretive nation that is not known for its open and transparent nature. But French photographer Eric Lafforgue was among the first visitors to be allowed to visit the North Korean fishing village of Jung Pyong Ri - a model community so remote it is not located on any maps. The rural outpost is part of a project to create homestays for tourists, allowing them a glimpse of life in North Korea, albeit a very sanitised version of reality. Photographer Eric Lafforgue experienced life in the beautiful North Korean fishing village of Jung Pyong Ri, which is opening the doors for tourists to witness rural life . He stayed in a well-kept homestay, home of the Chief of the village. There are only 23 families in the area, which is so remote it is not located on a map . The decor inside included an assortment of plush toys, plants, coloured mats and photographs of the country's leaders . The village is open for homestays and is a far cry from the poverty surrounding it, with its air conditioned facilities and houses equipped with three televisions. Described by Lafforgue as an Airbnb-style local property that tourists can visit, he also admits the conditions of a stay can be somewhat restrictive. Lafforgue explains that the fleeting view from the bus windows is very different to what he finds at the homestay. He explains: 'The roads on the east coast are very muddy and filled with potholes that workers have tried their best to fix. 'I see an electric fence lining the beach as an attempt to stall possible Japanese invasion. 'The poverty in these rural villages is palpable. From the comfy seat in my bus, I see old, dilapidated houses with roofs ready to collapse. 'Only huge murals of the smiling Kim Il Sung bring color to these bleak landscapes. My guide informs me that most tourists do not journey this far into the countryside, and that I may be the first European to ever visit this area.' However, the journey to the village and views from the house windows reveal traces of the surrounding hardship experienced by locals. 'It's a good opportunity to show tourists a flattering image of rural life, the fragile pillar of the country's economy,' Lafforgue said. 'The beautiful portrayal of rural life provides the North Korean government a flattering image to capitilise on.' The photographer travelled to the Myongchon county, situated in the North Hamgyong province, wary of what he would discover. 'Only 23 families resided here. Immediately, I fear I'm in a North Korean tourist trap, complete with actors portraying reality.' Lafforgue stayed with the village Chief, in a well-kept house, which, although it came complete with ensuite bathrooms, had a bed consisting of a futon on the floor. Each house in the village is identical. Lafforgue describes the decor as 'kitschy', with huge plush toys, plastic flowers, large plant pots being watched by the propaganda portraits lining the walls. And the village is still reeling from a visit 11 years ago by Kim Jong Il, when the community was first unveiled as a model village. The house the General entered was a two-storey building with the best view of the local sandy beach, and his visit is immortalised by a plaque above the door documenting the occasion. His visit still brings sobs to the homeowner, and she emotionally relayed the encounter to Lafforgue, explaining: 'I did not know General Kim Jong Il would come. It was a great surprise for me. 'The neighbors were so jealous. As we took a picture together, which I will forever treasure, he told me the house was nice. This made me so happy,' she said. French photographer Eric Lafforgue pictured  during his homestay with the smiling village chief in the village of Jung Pyong Ri . The sign at the top says: 'Kim Jong Il visited this house on December 12, 2004.' The village proudly remembers the occasion and said it inspired them to work harder for their leader's country . The junior suite Lafforgue stayed in has a private bathroom complete with a toilet, which is quite a luxury in the area. The water is heated by placing an antique electrical warmer in it . Lafforgue was treated to a sumptuous meal of duck for dinner, although he learned that the village members sometimes go hungry during the winter months. Americans are banned from visiting, but the French photographer asked if any Americans arriving would be welcomed to the homestay. The smart response was: 'Americans are our enemies, but I would welcome them in the name of legendary North Korean hospitality.' Despite the built-up houses, when asked about cell phones, his question was met with confusion, and electricity only runs until 9pm daily. The village members require a permit to travel within their country, and they are kept as treasured possessions when granted. Foreign tourists are hosted in the village, where locals can be seen collecting wood, flowers, and food. Lafforgue has been banend from North Korea for his photographs revealing the reality of life in the secretive country . Stunning location: The beautiful fishing village where tourists can experience rural life. 'It's a good opportunity to show tourists a flattering image of rural life, the fragile pillar of the country's economy,' Lafforgue said . As a present to the local boys Lafforgue offered them a French football magazine. Inside, they find photos of their national team and beam with excitement . The Chief proudly showed Lafforgue a photograph of his son, encased in a Mickey Mouse frame. He is serving his army conscription, which is mandatory for between three and five years for males, and selective for females. Other children in the village similarly aspire to be soldiers, with one mother stating to Lafforgue her sons were destined for the army. 'Our main goal is to defend our country, and for that, we need soldiers, not only musicians or doctors.' Lafforgue gathered that the area had received government funding and support to become as developed as it is today. Despite being impressed by the homestay, and the stunning beaches and landscapes in the fishing village, Lafforgue could not help but notice the poverty of the surroundings creeping in when they thought he wasn't looking. 'The guides wanted to hide from me the reality of this life, but from my bedroom window, I can see emaciated oxes with carts full of wood and women carrying heavy loads. I also see some girls picking flowers for a bouquet, and others picking grass in Red Cross bags to eat for lunch.' The photographer has been banned for his work depicting the realities of life in North Korea, and had to smuggle photographs out of the country on memory cards, after his camera was confiscated. Lafforgue spoke candidly to the Chief of the village, who explained what life was like in the rural outpost, which was completely cut off from the retsof the ocuntry until the 1990s. 'Life is very hard in the winter and sometimes the food supply is low,' the Chief told Lafforgue. Eighty per cent of the tourists here are from China. The Chinese, especially those from Beijing, are amazed by the cleanliness of the air. 'They wonder how laborers like us can afford such luxurious houses! he continues. 'I tell them that it is because the North Korean regime is more successful than the American government!' The Chief laughs. The Chief also recounts the best day of his life. 'It was when the Great Leader Kim Il Sung visited the village. We all wept. 'He was already quite old at this time, and it was such a great honor to meet him. Coming from a poor family, it motivated me to work harder for my leader’s country.' The Chief's son, serving in the army as a sergeant until the reunification of North and South Korea. When asked when he had last spoken to his son, he was told it was a long time ago . The visit of Kim Jong Il in 2004 still brings sobs to the woman of the house who hosted him. 'As we took a picture together, which I will forever treasure, he told me the house was nice. This made me so happy,' she said . Soldiers walk along the sandy beaches of the fishing village which is in Myongchon county, situated in the North Hamgyong province . North Korean agriculture works under quite difficult conditions, most of North Korea's territory is occupied by mountains and is thus not arable, the little land that is left faces many problems. Floods have washed away rice and corn fields in previous years, destroying a good part of the crops . As is tradition in North Korea, the night ended with music. Two twins perform, but their guitars strings are so old that they cannot be tuned.They have never heard Western music, according to Laffague . A North Korean woman collects picks grass in a Red Cross bags to eat for lunch. The Chief stated that life is very hard in the winter and sometimes the food supply is low . The guide informed Lafforgue that most tourists do not journey this far into the countryside, and that he may be the first European to ever visit this area . Lafforgue was able to communicate with the locals thanks to the help of a guide who provided a fluid translation for conversations . 'There is a disparaging difference between the attitudes of the children in metropolitan areas and those of the children in the rural areas. Many wave hello and gaze at me with astonished faces,' Lafforgue said . Children are playing on the beach in the Chilbo region, which is on the North East border with China. They are part of the national karate team and enjoy holidaying at the beach. A sign reading 'stop' is shown . Of the tourists who visited the village, 80% are from China, and they are amazed by the cleanliness of the air. 'They wonder how labourers like us can afford such luxurious houses!' the Chief said. 'I tell them that it is because the North Korean regime is more successful than the American government!' Lafforgue reported on the the tourists’ impact on the food supply during the winter, as the boats cannot go out to sea as often . A Korean girl picking a bouquet of flowers. Lafforgue learned that until the 1990s, the area was fairly cut off from the rest of the country . Women pull sacks through the village. One woman stated it remained a mystery as to why foreigners would want to visit her village. She admited the community enjoys a better standard of living than the average North Korean village thanks to the tourists .","Photographer Eric Lafforgue stayed in the fishing village of Jung Pyong Ri at a homestay open for tourists to visit .

'I did modelling campaigns growing up but my mum made me wait until I was 17 to sign with an agency and I didn't move to New York and start working full-time until I was 18.

"The final moments of a gunman's day before murdering a star surgeon at Boston's Brigham Women's Hospital have been detailed in a chilling new profile the reveals how the man's sanity was consumed by a plot for revenge. Cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Michael Davidson, 44, from Wellesley, Massachusetts, was shot by Stephen Pasceri, 55, on the morning of Tuesday, January 20, and passed away late that evening. Pasceri's relatives suggested that he was angry over the death of his mother, whom Dr Davidson had treated. Scroll down for video . Vendetta? Accountant Stephen Pasceri (left) opened fire on Dr. Michael Davidson (right) at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday, blaming Davidson for his mother's death . Now a lengthy investigation at The Boston Globe has taken readers inside Pasceri's life and final hours. He had left his Millbury home telling his wife he was on his way to work at the Waters Corporation, despite calling in sick to his accountant job. He left behind a thumb drive with his last thoughts to be sent to his brother. Pasceri has become obsessed with the idea that his mother, Marguerite Pasceri, 78, was killed by a post-operative drug prescribed by Davidson. He death certificate lists the official cause as 'cardiovascular collapse.' Referencing Pslams in his final thoughts, Pasceri wrote: 'The doctor is dead. I am dead. There is nothing more anyone can do.' Davidson left behind his wife, who is a plastic surgeon, and their three other children, two girls aged seven and nine and a two-year-old son, his father-in-law told the Boston Herald. It later emerged the couple was expecting their fourth child. Left behind: Davidson and his wife Terri, pictured, have two daughters, seven and nine, and a son, two . Pasceri wandered the hospital for an hour before coming upon the doctor and firing. Security footage shows him calmly strolling by gift shops and the cardiovascular clinic. Though Pasceri was known as a husband and father, a man who regularly attended church and even started a men's group to help with home repair projects, those close to him said there had long been a dark side. 'Really deep down, inside, he must have known that he was wrong for some of the things he did,' sister, Marguerite Joly, told the Globe. 'I think he slowly lost his mind.' Brother John Pasceri did not think mental illness was a factor but agreed that Pasceri could be unforgiving. 'When you were wrong, you had to suffer the judgments of Steve,' he told reporters. A man with a troubled past, he had been arrested at 17 for stealing guns from a neighbor's house. But his mother got a good lawyer who cut a deal for counseling and military service, and he spent three years in the Army until finally coming home in December 1980. It was that dark side that emerged at the hospital when he approached secretary Cheryl Cantalupo demanding to see Davidson without an appointment. 'No, you don’t understand,' he said. 'I’ve traveled a long way. I have to see Dr. Davidson. I’m not leaving without seeing him.' Finally, Pasceri was taken back to Exam Room 15. Davidson was later reported to have remarked on the way to the meeting: 'Watch this, he’ll probably shoot me.' Mourning: Brigham and Women's Hospital doctors, from the left, Charles Morris, Andrew Eisenhauer,  Daniel Wiener and Pinak Shah appear emotional as they face members of the media to speak about Davidson . After what witnesses described as a long, repetitive argument over the effects of the drug Pasceri blamed for his mother's death, the bereaved son pulled out a gun. Davidson was hit first in the left hp, then in the back as he spun and reached for the door. His last moments were spent warning others. 'Run, run, he’s shooting, he’s shooting!' he was said to have cried out as he ran from the exam room. After shooting the surgeon, Pasceri went into another room and shot himself. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said officers conducting a room-by-room search found the gunman dead in an exam room with the weapon. Later, four of Davidson's colleagues paid tribute to him during a news conference at the hospital, and remembered him as 'almost always the smartest man in the room'. Blame game: Marguerite E. (Olofson) Pasceri passed away on November 15, 2014 and it is thought that her son and executor, Stephen Pasceri blamed Dr. Davidson at Brigham and Women's Hospital for her passing . 'You all should be absolutely assured that Michael Davidson was one of the kindest, best possible men that ever walked on this earth,' colleague Dr. Andrew Eisenhauer said, ABC News reported. 'We knew that and his patients knew that and his family knows that.' His colleagues also recalled his 'silly side' and how he played guitar in a band with other doctors from the hospital. Dr Davidson's heartbroken father-in-law told the Herald how Dr Davidson had yelled for patients and staff to flee before he was shot. 'He was a hero - he told everybody to get out,' he said. 'He started yelling, ""Get out. Get out."" He knew it was coming.' He recalled how much he cared for his patients, and added: 'He loved his family. He loved his kids. He loved my daughter to death.' A fund has been set up for the family here. Pasceri, who was licensed to carry a firearm, may have also been holding a vendetta because of the health care his father Greg received during a fatal hear attack in December 2011. Somber: A memorial and lowering of the the flag took place near the hospital on Wednesday for the doctor . The Worcester Telegram reported that in 2012, Pasceri became so furious that his mother had been left with a $8,000 medical bill, he wrote to Senator John Kerry and US Rep. James McGovern to demand an investigation. However, the newspaper noted that the Pasceri family had no issue with the level of care received by their father at Massachusetts General Hospital. Pasceri's sister said she was stunned that her brother had attacked the doctor. Heartbroken: Administrators and staff at a leading Boston hospital mourned the death of  Davidson . Sadness: The hospital's logo flag was lowered to half-staff during a Wednesday ceremony to honor Davidson . Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he was 'deeply saddened' by Davidson's death. 'This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City,' he said in a statement early Wednesday . 'Everything seemed to be going really well. I have no idea why he snapped like this,' said Marguerite Jolym, according to the Boston Herald. According to Joly, her brother 'deeply loved' his mother and said her 'warm, compassionate, generous and understanding personality was a gift and example to the world'. 'I think it comes down to the fact that my brother thought it was the doctor's fault that my mother died,' Joly said. 'I don't know why my brother would blame him. I really don't know why.' 'We can't even wrap our brains around this,' Marguerite Joly said. 'There was no indication whatsoever that he would ever do anything like this... All his ducks were in a row,' she said. 'This was not a bad, evil man. Something happened, and I don't know what.' Response: Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief William Gross, (center left), walks through a revolving door as he departs the Shapiro building at Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday after the shooting . Security: The hospital has a well-drilled evacuation procedure for an active shooter situation and put that plan into action . Evacuation: Medical personnel walk past law enforcement officials, (right), as they depart the Shapiro building after the cardiologist was shot . In the aftermath of Dr. Davidson's death, staff at Brigham and women's entered into a period of mourning according to NECN. Hospital officials  lowered a flag outside the hospital to half-staff in honor of Davidson. 'Dr. Davidson was a wonderful and inspiring cardiac surgeon who devoted his career to saving lives and improving the quality of life of every patient he cared for,' said a statement issued by the hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. 'It is truly devastating that his own life was taken in this horrible manner.' Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he was 'deeply saddened' by Davidson's death. 'This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City,' he said in a statement early Wednesday. Global reputation: Brigham and Women's in Boston is world renowned for its emergency surgeries and facial reconstructions . Multiple agencies: The FBI, Boston Police Department and the ATF all arrived at the hospital after the incident on Tuesday morning . Checks: A man in medical scrubs ducks under crime scene tape as he leaves the building at Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday morning . Shortly after the shooting, one witness said that the Shapiro building had been placed on lockdown and dozens of emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene. 'Once we were clear of the waiting room, there were police officers with their weapons drawn yelling, 'Get down! Get down,'' said one man to WCVB. Hospital employees are well-drilled for the nightmare scenario of a shooter inside the building. In November 2013, doctors and nurses and other staff at the world-famous institution underwent training for an active shooter situation and viewed a video for a so-called 'Code Silver' event. Crime scene: Boston Police officers, including Commissioner William Evans (C), work inside the building where a shooting occurred at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston, Massachusetts . 'I am extremely proud of the way our staff responded,' said hospital president Dr. Elizabeth Nabel according to the Boston Globe. Boston police had at one stage mistakenly tweeted that Pasceri had been apprehended and was in custody. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said that because the doctor was surrounded by colleagues medical help was administered immediately. 'We are looking at a possible motive. We know (the gunman) came into the hospital on the second floor looking for this particular doctor. There was a reason he targeted this doctor,' Evans said according to WMUR.Com. 'Our prayers go out to the doctor's wife,' Evans said.","Dr. Michael Davidson was shot twice by Stephen Pasceri at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston on Tuesday and later died from his injuries .

"Police in Florida are searching for a 27-year-old man suspected of killing his grandmother and stealing her car Wednesday. Patrick Campbell was named a person of interest after his grandmother, 64-year-old Darlene Robertson, was found beaten and stabbed to death in her New Smyrna Beach home. According to police, the victim suffered blunt force trauma to the head and cuts to her abdomen. Scroll down for video . Wanted man: Patrick Campbell, 27 (left), has been named a person of interest in the murder of his grandmother, 64-year-old Darlene Robertson (right), who was found beaten and stabbed to death . Grisly end: Robertson's son found her lying in a pool of blood in her living room in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, when he went to check up on her . Evidence: Police found Campbell's bike on Robertson's property, leading them to believe that he was at the house around the time of the slaying . Investigators say they found no evidence of a forced entry at Robertson’s home in the 400 block of DeSoto Drive. They believe her grandson, who has been described by friends as mentally unstable, may have been staying with her. Darlene Robertson was discovered lying in a pool of blood in the middle of her living room at around 10am Wednesday by her son, who came to check up on her after she failed to show up for work at a condominium association, according to WFTV. On a 911 call the son told the dispatcher: 'I think she's been stabbed... I think I can see a wound on her stomach.' Responding officers established that Robertson, who lived alone, was last heard from at around 8.30pm Tuesday. Police have found evidence placing Campbell at his grandmother’s home on the night of the murder. His bicycle was found on the property. On Wednesday, police were waiting for a search warrant to enter Campbell’s apartment. They also have reviewed surveillance video from a neighbor’s home, reported The Daytona Beach News-Journal. Armed and dangerous: Campbell is described as unstable and mentally disturbed. Anyone who encounters him is urged to call police . Local authorities have issued a nationwide alert to help locate Patrick Campbell, who is considered armed and dangerous. Anyone who recognizes him is asked to call police right away, as the 27-year-old is believed to be unstable. ‘I think that it’s safe to say that he is not of his right mind,’ New Smyrna Beach Police Chief Mike Coffin said. Henry Toland, a long-time friend and former roommate of Campbell's, described the man as delusional to the station WESH-TV. Other people familiar with the 27-year-old suggested that he may be schizophrenic. Detectives are also searching for Darlene Robertson' missing car, a 2006 beige or tan Nissan Altima with Florida tag 803MBW. A $1,000 reward is being offered for information leading to Campbell's arrest. The person of interest has a past criminal record, which includes at least four arrests since 2011 on charges of trespassing, DUI and marijuana possession.","Patrick Campbell, 27, named a person of interest in murder of his grandmother, 64-year-old Darlene Robertson .

"Charged: Kevin C. Matthews, pictured, is accused of sexually abusing a 3-year-old boy on a plane . Federal prosecutors in Utah have charged a man accused of sexually abusing a sleeping 3-year-old boy on a plane. Investigators say in court documents filed Tuesday that the child was seated next to Kevin C. Matthews on the flight from Chicago to San Diego with a layover in Salt Lake City. Charging documents say that the boy's mother was concerned about being seated across the aisle from her son Monday. However, their family was flying standby and Matthews appeared to be friendly, according to the documents. Prosecutors say other passengers saw Matthews touch the child inappropriately after the boy fell asleep and reported the groping to flight attendants, who moved the child to his mother's lap. The Deseret News reported that Matthews is 48 and from Illinois. He is facing an abusive sexual contact charge over the alleged incident on the Delta flight, according to the newspaper. In an affidavit obtained by the Deseret News, a FBI agent said Matthews said he'd drank several glasses of wine, but denied being drunk. Matthews also reportedly denied touching the child's groin with his hand. Matthews told the agent 'it was possible that he touched (the boy), but if he did touch (him), it was an accident,' according to the affidavit. Defense attorney Susanne Gustin did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

"A six-year-old girl was taken to hospital after drinking from a bottle of milk which her parents said was contaminated with glue. Jessica Bamford of Devonport, Plymouth, was drinking the full fat milk when a 'white hardened substance' formed in and around her mouth, according to her mother. She screamed and spat it out and was taken to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital. There, doctors said the mystery substance 'smelt like false nail glue'. Six-year-old Jessica (left) with her father Dwain (right), who had bought the milk from Iceland the previous day . Jessica's mother Samantha, 31, who has five other children, said she was left with glue all over her fingers after the incident. The youngster was understandably shaken up afterwards and was left with red marks where the substance had been. Fortunately Jessica didn't swallow any of the mystery substance. Her father Dwain had bought the milk from an Iceland store in Plymouth the previous day. Samantha, from Devonport, Plymouth, said: 'It's just disgusting. She freaked out and was very shaken. 'She remembers spitting it out in the sink the second she felt something was wrong. It's just lucky she didn't ingest it because this could have been a completely different situation.' Jessica unscrewed the blue top and took a sip straight from the carton, when the milk began solidifying in her mouth, her mother said. Iceland has said it was sorry to hear about the incident but the frozen food chain wishes to investigate further . Jessica is back to her usual self but her mother Samantha wants an apology from Iceland where she was a frequent customer . 'I've tried contacting the Iceland store and Trading Standards. Iceland said I have to have a hospital note and then I can send the milk back and they will check for contaminants. 'But thousands of people buy from Iceland every day and the milk is still on the shelves. Surely that can't be just. Jessica no longer has milk and cereal for breakfast and has switched to toast . 'I would recommend people check their milk beforehand to be sure.' Disgusted Samantha said she has also contacted the dairy but told to contact Trading Standards. Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon, have told the family it will take seven days from Jessica being admitted to send out an official note confirming she was treated there. She said: 'By then the milk will be gone off and it will be contaminated anyway. 'I have six children and I am constantly buying from Iceland to save money. It's easy and convenient. 'I always go there, but it's just disgusting and it puts you off. 'If she had swallowed, it would have been a really major situation. I just want an apology but I haven't even had that.' Jessica has now returned to full health but has now swapped her normal breakfast of cereal for toast. A spokesperson from Iceland said: 'We are sorry to hear about this issue, but we would like the chance to investigate. 'We would advise she call our customer call team so they can investigate the matter further.'","Six-year-old Jessica Bamford of Plymouth seemed to find glue in her milk .

"A listed Victorian rectory is in danger of collapse after its millionaire cocaine addict owner allowed it to become overgrown and delapidated. The home in Columb Major, Cornwall is considered one of the most important buildings from the Gothic Revival movement, but it is now uninhabitated and has fallen into a state of extreme disrepair. Its owner, a property dealer who was jailed for drugs possession, has refused to renovate it - but the local council has not exercised its legal powers to force him to take action. Overgrown: The Old Rectory in Columb Major, Cornwall is almost inaccessible because it is so neglected . Rubbish: The house is full of old furniture and other debris despite its Grade II* listing from English Heritage . Damage: Holes in the roof and ceiling are causing water damage to the historic Victorian structure . The Old Rectory, which is Grade II*-listed, was built in 1851 by architect William White, who trained with the great Gothic Revival master George Gilbert Scott. It was originally designed to be a palace for a bishop, before being downgraded to a rector's home and later becoming a hotel in recent years. But despite the building's heritage, it is now derelict, filled with piles of rubbish and surrounded by overgrown plants, while major water damage has been caused by holes in the roof. Photographs taken a few years ago show broken furniture piled up inside, with peeling walls and exposed ceiling beams. Greenery has grown up all around the outside of the house, potentially threatening its structure. Cornwall Council has not taken legal action against the Old Rectory's owner, property tycoon James Brown, who was sent in prison in 2012 after police found a large haul of cocaine hidden in his Bentley convertible. Neglected: The home was built in 1851 by William White and is considered a Gothic Revival masterpiece . Warning: Campaigners are lobbying Cornwall Council to force the rectory's owner to make repairs . Debris: Photographs taken a few years ago show the shocking state of the listed building . The Victorian Society, which promotes the cause of 19th-century architecture, recently launched a campaign to save the building from its 'shocking state of disrepair'. Director Chris Costelloe said: 'Cornwall Council must take action now or this irreplaceable Grade II*-listed example of domestic Gothic Revival architecture will be lost. 'Further delay will result in much of the historic fabric being unsalvageable and the repairs will become enormously expensive.' The society claims that Cornwall Council has been aware of the threat to the building for at least four years, but has failed to act. Officials insisted that they could not take action while Brown was in prison, because it would breach his human rights. Peeling: Paint is coming off the walls in the 19th-century home, which was built as a bishop's palace . Abandoned: No one is living in the house and plants are climbing up around the walls . Heyday: This historic postcard shows how the Old Rectory looked in its prime . Owner: Property tycoon and cocaine addict James Brown is the legal owner of the Old Rectory . The council has the power to impose an 'urgent works notice' which would force the owner to repair the house, but it has done nothing more than try to talk to the owner. A spokesman said: 'The council is once again trying to make contact with the proprietors of the building to open a dialogue in regard to its current state. As yet the council has not had a response from the proprietors of this building.' English Heritage has joined the calls to save the Old Rectory, calling it 'an incredibly important site and an architectural gem', and has been urging the council to take action. Inspector Simon Hickman said: 'The site is on our English Heritage South-West Heritage At Risk register and we are doing everything we can to ensure it is saved. 'Now the owner is no longer in prison we have advised Cornwall Council serve a repairs notice as soon as possible. We have offered to underwrite the repairs notice and to support them any way we can.' Locals in the small village say they are scared to speak out about the derelict house - one told MailOnline that he had been harassed on the Internet after raising awareness of the issue. Brown retired at the age of 26 after making millions of pounds as a property developer, but his life spiralled downhill when he became addicted to cocaine. The businessman took so much of the drug that his nose collapsed, and in 2012 he was sentenced to five years in prison for possession of class A drugs and a collection of handguns.","Old Rectory in Columb Major, Cornwall was built in 1851 by William White .

'If he — or anyone — knows anything, please come forward so we can have some answers,' pleaded Allison, who is expecting a daughter in June. 'It's been nearly 18 years so as a family we would welcome anything that could put our minds at rest,' she added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Before they retired Bob was an engineer and Debbie an elementary school teacher, have both now retired . Durst, who is worth an estimated $100 million, was arrested in New Orleans last weekend. Police believe he was preparing to flee the country as he was found in a hotel room with a latex mask, false ID, a loaded Smith & Wesson .38 caliber revolver with one spent shell casing and $42,000 in cash. The family of Kristen (right) want him to help end their agony . 'We hope that one of these days we will get some answers as to what happened to Kristen.' Kristen disappeared from San Francisco in 1997. Oakland Police now say there is no hard evidence to suggest that Durst was involved, even though he was living in the city at the time. But In a statement, issued through family friend Joan Scanlon-Petruski, parents Bob and Debbie Modafferi pointed out that the FBI, which had investigated Durst before, could come up with new evidence now.Cops in the northern California town of Eureka are probing whether he could have been involved in the disappearance of another teen, 16-year-old Karen Mitchell who vanished just five months after Kristen. Durst, 71, was sensationally acquitted of the 2001 murder of neighbor Morris Black and has long been suspected of killing his first wife, Kathie, and then murdering long-time friend Susan Berman because she knew too much. He was shockingly caught on tape saying 'I killed them all,' at the end of the HBO documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst. Durst, who is worth an estimated $100 million, was arrested in New Orleans last weekend, shortly before the finale of the series aired. Police believe he was preparing to flee the country as he was found in a hotel room with a latex mask, false ID, a loaded Smith & Wesson .38 caliber revolver with one spent shell casing and $42,000 in cash. A small amount of marijuana was also discovered. He is now on suicide watch as he awaits trial in Louisiana on gun and drug possession charges and extradition to California to face a murder trial in the Berman case. Home sweet home: Last December the family sold the five-bedroom, four-bath family home in an upscale development south of Charlotte where Kristen and her three sisters had grown up . Summer in the city: Kristen during her freshman year at North Carolina State University. She moved to San Francisco on her 18th birthday, June 1, 1997. She planned to spend the summer in the City by the Bay before returning to her sophomore year at North Carolina State University where she was studying design . But as new interest has been aroused in Durst, he finds himself linked to cases in at least four states, including the disappearances of Modafferi and Mitchell. Kristen Modafferi moved to San Francisco on her 18th birthday, June 1, 1997. She planned to spend the summer in the City by the Bay before returning to her sophomore year at North Carolina State University where she was studying design. The previous year she was one of the inaugural recipients on the now-highly regarded Park Scholarships which put a premium on travel and service. Within days she started work at Spinelli's coffee shop in the Crocker Galleria in San Francisco's financial district to help pay for a photography course she was due to start at UC Berkeley the day after she vanished. On the day of her disappearance she asked a co-worker for directions to Baker Beach. After she went missing police dogs tracked her scent to the water's edge at nearby Land's End Beach. The last sighting of Kristen was walking through the upscale mall with a blonde woman, who has never been identified. Speculation has risen in recent days that it was in fact Durst, a noted cross-dresser. 'That blonde woman has never come forward and no-one has ever found her,' said Allison Modafferi. Scholar: Kristen at her high school graduation. She was one of the inaugural recipients on the now-highly regarded Park Scholarships which put a premium on travel and service. This is not the first time that Durst has been linked to Modafferi or to Mitchell, who was 16 when she was last seen in Eureka, California, five months after Kristen's disappearance. Durst owned a house in San Francisco at the time Kristen vanished and he was known to be living in Trinidad, California, some 25 miles north of Eureka when Karen went missing after getting into a car. A police sketch of a man driving that car bears an uncanny likeness to the troubled New York property heir. Author Matt Birkbeck first connected Durst to the two missing teens in the 2003 paperback edition of his book A Deadly Secret: The Strange Disappearance of Kathie Durst. The FBI checked Durst out at the time but could not prove that he was connected to either woman. Allison Modafferi is also skeptical even now that Durst, who was found not guilty of the 2001 murder of Black, his neighbor in Galveston, Texas, despite admitting that he chopped his body up and threw it in the sea, will be charged in connection with her sister's disappearance. 'There is just not a lot of evidence,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'The FBI looked at him a few years ago and came up with nothing. 'We have had so many leads over the years that have led nowhere.' The family has never given up hope that Kristen, who would now be 35, is still alive, despite the fact there has been no trace of her for nearly half of her life. They dismiss the possibility that she might have staged her own disappearance. 'We were a very close family — we still are a very close family,' said Allison. 'And there are no signs that she wanted to disappear. She hadn't packed her bags or withdrawn money or anything like that.' But still the family clings to the hope that she is still alive. In obituaries placed in the Charlotte Observer after the deaths of her grandfather Tony Modafferi in 2002 and his widow Lillian in 2006, the family wrote that they left 'four granddaughters, Allison, Kristen, Lauren and Meghan.' Joan Scanlon-Petruski of The Kristen Foundation, a non-profit set up to help find missing adults, told Daily Mail Online that the family is hoping that the Durst link may finally bring some closure to their 18-year ordeal . 'Of course we live with that hope,' said Allison, 38. 'But it has been a very long time.' And as for the chance that she has been held captive for a dozen and a half years, she added: 'There is a part of each of us that hopes for something like that, but it is hard to imagine what the past 18 years would have been like for her if that were the case.' Kristen's parents, Bob, an engineer and Debbie, an elementary school teacher, have both now retired. Last December they finally sold the five-bedroom, four-bath home in an upscale development south of Charlotte, that Kristen and her three sisters had grown up in, and moved to Florida. In a statement, issued through family friend Joan Scanlon-Petruski, Bob and Debbie Modafferi pointed out that the FBI had investigated Durst before. 'It is possible though that the ongoing interrogation of Durst by law enforcement that's taking place right now could uncover new information that could be of value and lead to the truth about what happened to Kristen,' they added. Scanlon-Petruski, who runs The Kristen Foundation, a non-profit set up to help find missing adults, told Daily Mail Online that the family is just hoping that the Durst link may finally bring some closure to their 18-year ordeal. 'Robert Durst is crazy and he has shown he is not willing to admit anything,' she said. 'I certainly want it to be him,' Scanlon-Petruski added. 'Then we would be able to find out at least something, but we have been disappointed so many times in the past.' But police in Oakland, California say there is nothing new to link Durst to Modafferi. 'The Oakland Police Department conducted an investigation with the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the 1997 disappearance of Kristen Modafferi. The investigation was open and active for several years. At this time we do not have any evidence that indicates Robert Durst was involved in her disappearance.' The department said in a statement.","Kristen Modafferi, 18, from Charlotte, North Carolina, disappeared in San Francisco without a trace in 1997 .

"They were just ten and seven when their beautiful TV presenter mother, Caron Keating, lost a long battle with breast cancer at just 41. A decade later, they have transformed from angelic-looking boys into strapping, handsome young men. Charlie is currently enjoying a year out from his advertising degree to complete internships and Gabriel, his gentle younger brother, is in his final year studying his A-levels. Scroll down for video . All grown up: Gloria Hunniford pictured with her grandsons Gabriel (far left) and Charlie (far right). The boys were just ten and seven when they lost their mum, Caron Keating, to breast cancer . As they were: Doting Gloria, pictured with her grandsons as young children, says she feels disappointment that her daughter isn't here to watch her sons' achievements . The days when she could cradle them in her arms have long passed but their achievements leave their grandmother, Gloria Hunniford, bursting with pride. However she admits her happiness hides traces of disappointment that their mother has missed sharing their milestones. The Loose Women panelist and TV presenter, 74, said: ‘The only time I do get frustrated is when I think about all the brilliant moments Caron’s missing as the boys grow up. 'When Charlie first went to university, I felt really quite disturbed by that. Caron had an understanding of English literature that I don’t have. She would have loved to sit down with Charlie and now with Gabriel to discuss whatever it was that they were studying. ‘From the research I’ve done, it seems that a child misses a parent most when he graduates, when he gets engaged, when he marries and particularly when he has his first child. You want to show your child to your parents. And Charlie and Gabriel will never be able to do that with their mother.’ What bolsters Miss Hunniford, who is married to hairdresser Stephen Way, is the warm and loving relationship she has with her grandsons. They tease her mercilessly, which she plainly adores, calling her a variety of names from Glo, to G-Dog, G-Lo or Big G. She said: ‘What helps to sustain me now is that they’ve turned out to be such fine young men. And I think it’s lovely that they’re still very huggy with me, very demonstrative which isn’t always the case with boys of their age and they rib me all the time. ‘They’re part of my healing. I see Caron’s spirit living on in them and that’s a comfort to me. Charlie has her wicked sense of humour and Gabriel looks so like her. They’ve been in my life from the moment they entered the world, quite literally. Caron asked me to be there as each of them was born. So the bond between us has always been exceptionally tight and was made even more so because of her loss.’ Miss Keating was a popular Blue Peter presenter and was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997. She was initially told she would be lucky to survive more than 18 months but went on to live for seven years before she died in her mother’s arms in 2004. Unbreakable bond: Gloria keeps the memory of Caron, who passed away in 2004, alive with regular fundraising events for the Caron Keating Foundation . Soon after, Miss Hunniford, backed by the rest of the family, set up the Caron Keating Foundation which has now raised millions, given away in small grants to hundreds of deserving causes for all types of cancer. At the end of November (2014), a glitzy dinner at the Dorchester was organised to celebrate Caron’s life and to talk about the foundation. A succession of famous faces, both in person and on screen, paid their tributes. Ant and Dec, Cliff Richard, Janet Ellis, Rod Stewart, Michael Ball, Neil Diamond, Rob Brydon – all shared recollections of the popular TV presenter. The Blue Peter presenter lost her battle with breast cancer when her sons, Charlie and Gabriel, were just 10 and seven . Charlie joked: ‘And I learnt a few things about Mum - I didn’t know that Phillip Schofield could have been my dad. Apparently, he and Mum went out together for about a year which was something no one had ever told me.’ There were insights for Gabriel, too, about his quirky dress sense: ‘I didn’t realise me and my mum shared the same shopping habits. She also tended to buy clothes that a normal person might not. 'For example, I got it into my head recently to buy a completely white puffa jacket which is totally impractical as I discovered today when a girl gave me a big hug and got foundation all down it. Glo tells me Mum was into grunge before it had been invented. She had a really wacky dress sense. And she was a hoarder like me.’ Gloria on Caron's wedding day to the boys' father Russ Lindsay. He's since gone on to remarry, to television presenter Sally Meen, and have two daughters . Their father Russ Lindsay went on to marry breakfast presenter Sally Meen, 49, in 2006 and the boys have two half-sisters they adore: Tilly, six and Flora. Charlie and Gabriel are committed to running the foundation in the future but for now Miss Hunniford is more than happy to carry on, for keeping Caron’s memory alive is a source of comfort: ‘I have a little saying,’ she said: ‘People never die if they live on the lips of the living.’ For more information, www.caronkeating.org .","Caron Keating lost a seven-year battle with breast cancer in 2004, aged 41 .

"Cleared: Lloyd Erp was acquitted after being accused of murdering his wife Lori in a suicide pact. The scars from where he shot himself are visible . A man charged with murdering his wife during a double suicide pact that went wrong has been dramatically acquitted by a jury. Lloyd Erp has spent more than two years in jail waiting to come to trial over the death of his wife Lori. The court heard how the couple, from Portland, Oregon, had both signed a suicide note saying they wanted to to die on March 2, 2013. Mr Erp told the court that his 52-year-old wife shot herself twice in the head in their bedroom, before he took the rifle and tried to kill himself. He shot himself twice in the head, but survived. Police were called and Lori was found in bed. Mr Erp was arrested and charged with murder, and during the trial prosecutors claimed a post-mortem examination of Lori's body suggested she had been shot by someone else. But on Wednesday Mulnomah County jurors cleared him of murder, after deliberating for less than a day. During the trial, a defence lawyer told jurors the Erps were deeply in love but suffered health problems and addictions to painkillers. They also faced losing their home because neither of them were in work. Mr Erp told the court he still missed his wife terribly, and some days still wants to die, according to a report by OregonLive. An earlier trial saw the jury reach deadlock - because they could not decide whether Mr Erp had shot and murdered his wife - and a mistrial was declared. But during the latest court appearance, prosecution lawyer Tom Cleary urged jurors to follow Oregon law, which said that if they believed Mr Erp fired the fatal shots they must find him guilty of murder. 'This is not a Death With Dignity case,' the prosecutor said. The judge also instructed jurors that Oregon law doesn't define murder as assisting another in committing suicide, such as handing someone a loaded gun. But state law does define murder as committing the actual killing, the judge said -- actually pulling the trigger even if the person wanted to die. Dr Christopher Young, deputy state medical examiner, testified that he determined Lori Erp didn't shoot herself but died by someone else's action. Mr Erp's 52-year-old wife Lori (pictured) was found dead at her home in bed with two shots to her head. Prosecutors alleged Mr Erp had tried to kill her, but he successfully argued that she had shot herself . However defence expert and former medical examiner Dr Michael Propst, said it was unclear whether the woman died by her own hand. Lawyer for the defence Kasla Rutledge added: 'People who are murdered in their sleep by their husbands don't leave suicide notes.' The report in OregonLive added that Mr Erp had not been allowed to attend his wife's memorial service. 'This has been two long years that Lloyd has been in custody, waiting to be exonerated,' Ms Rutledge said. 'He has not been able to grieve. He has not been able to process what happened and his survivor's guilt. And now he gets a chance to do that.'","Lloyd Erp was accused of shooting his wife in Oregon while she was in bed .

"Texas police on Wednesday discovered the long-dead body of a man slumped in his SUV in a Walmart on Sunday. Authorities in Deer Park say a manager from the store followed a foul odor to a silver Dodge Durango. Inside was the body of a Native American male, Chron.com reports. Investigators would later determine he'd been dead for over a week. Followed an odor: The body of a Native American man was found in this silver SUV on Sunday in a Walmart parking lot after an employee followed a foul odor to the vehicle . Shopping center: Police say the man had been dead at least a week in the Deer Park, Texas shopping center . Police say the man's vehicle had been in the parking lot since the time of his death. No foul play is suspected but police said Monday they were treating the SUV as a crime scene. The unidentified man was transported to the Harris County Medical Examiner's for further examination. While startling, this is hardly the first body found in a parking lot of the retail mega-chain. Just last month,  29-year-old New Hampshire mother Maura Laughlin was found dead in her car in a Walmart parking lot after recently becoming homeless, the Concord Monitor reported. On March 2, a homeless man was found dead in the car in which he lived in Brevard County, Florida after dying from what appeared to be natural causes, Florida Today reported. That body, too, was discovered because of its foul odor after the man had died days earlier. The same was true at another Florida Walmart, this one in Orlando, where a man's body was discovered after decaying for several days back in 2011. Crime scene? Police say they've seen no indication of foul play but are treating the SUV as a crime scene, nonetheless .","Police in Deer Park, Texas say a Native American man was found slumped in his silver Dodge Durango on Sunday ."
"Tony Blair has insisted he was right to let hundreds of thousands of Eastern European migrants move to Britain. The former Prime Minister said it was not a 'mistake' to open Britain's borders to eight former Communist countries in 2004, despite the decision being criticised by the Labour leader Ed Miliband. Mr Miliband said the former PM had 'got it wrong' when he allowed people from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to work in Britain without restrictions. Tony Blair has insisted he was right to let hundreds of thousands of Eastern European migrants move to Britain . Britain was almost alone in the EU in not imposing transitional controls to slow the rate of migration. The decision to allow freedom of movement into Britain sparked a mass wage of migration - with around 170,000 eastern European migrants moving to the UK every year. Mr Miliband said the party under Mr Blair 'became too disconnected from the concerns of working people'. The Labour leader has pledged to ban immigrants from claiming benefits for two years and to tackle rogue employers exploiting migrant labour. But Mr Blair said political leaders needed to stand up and defend freedom of movement in Europe. He said the only way to defeat Ukip and other anti-immigration parties was to expose their 'ridiculous' plans. Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Blair had 'got it wrong' when he allowed people from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to work in Britain without restrictions. Mr Blair said migrants would have come sooner or later even if transitional controls had been imposed. He said: 'I don't agree it was a mistake. All we did was bring forward what would have happened anyway. In 2004 the economy was booming and we had a requirement for skilled workers from abroad. 'Supposing you put all those people from Eastern Europe back out of Britain again would we be a stronger better country? The answer is no.' Tony Blair said political leaders should attack Nigel Farage instead of pandering to his party's views . Mr Blair made the remarks in an interview with Trevor Philips, the former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, for a Channel 4 documentary to be broadcast on Thursday. He said Labour MPs should argue back against people like Rochdale voter Gillian Duffy – the infamous Labour-supporting pensioner dismissed as a 'bigot' by Gordon Brown in the run up to the 2010 election for complaining about the levels of immigration. Mr Blair said: 'I would have said to her, I understand why you feel as you feel and why it's difficult. 'But here's the other side of the picture. So if we want to keep all those people out of the country let's look at what their impact has actually been on our country and let's look at why the idea in the European Union that people are able to move freely across frontiers is a good idea. 'I mean, you have just got to put the argument. She probably wouldn't agree and she might vote for someone else as a result.' Political leaders have a 'duty' to say that UKIP's proposals to end free movement are 'ridiculous', he said. He said: 'If Britain wrenched itself out of the European Union, this idea that Nigel Farage would go off - can you imagine anything more ridiculous than the idea that he would negotiate a bespoke agreement between Britain and the European Union? 'I mean that would be an interesting negotiation to be a fly on the wall on.' 'I'm not saying you don't have to deal with it with a real understanding of the anxieties that people have but your job as the leader is to say 'Well, look, this is where I think we should go.' 'If you believe in the UKIP thing then say it, but don't indulge their rhetoric, their sentiment around the issue, because what you do then is you effectively you give them a greater credibility.'","Former Prime Minister said it was not a 'mistake' to open Britain's borders .

"It had started as a joyful day. Joy Veron, 30, Texan schoolteacher, was on vacation with her family in the Colorado mountains. The trip had been idyllic, and they were preparing for one last swim before driving home to Texas. Then disaster struck. Her three small children, then aged between two and seven, ran ahead and got into the family SUV, which had its engine running and was parked next to a cliff leading down to a deep canyon. In seconds, the car slipped into gear and started to roll. Scroll down for video . Guts: Joy Veron speaking to Oprah Winfrey on the Oprah: Where are they now? show in March 2015. She survived the accident and battled for years to regain her ability to walk, before eventually being forced to accept that she would never walk again . Happiness: Joy Veron and her three children, L-R: Chloe, 7, Elliot, 2, Annie, 5, in 1999, before the tragic accident that left Joy unable to walk. She threw herself underneath the wheels of a runaway SUV to stop it rolling over a cliff with her children inside . Struggle: After the accident, Joy Veron travelled to Portugal to undergo intensive rehabilitation. She had a stem cell transplant and surgery in an effort to walk again. Tragically, she eventually had to accept that she would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life . 'I just saw complete fear,' she told the Oprah Show. 'I remember their little eyes were huge, looking at me just like, ""help me, do something"".' Without thinking, she rushed over and threw herself between the vehicle and the canyon, refusing to let her children die. She continued to struggle with the car even as she found herself being dragged under the wheels. 'I just was throwing myself in front of it just to put something in its path,' she said. 'I remember thinking, ""I didn't make it in time and I'm getting run over. I'm going to hear a crash pretty soon.' 'I tried to stop it with my hands, which, of course, I couldn't,' she told PBS. 'And I remember feeling it begin to run over me. I fell backwards, and the front of the car caught me by the heels. 'I did like a somersault under the car and the third time it hit I knew that it broke my back. I was 30-years-old and the whole life I knew was gone.' But she had already done enough. Her sacrifice had slowed the car's momentum just enough to allow her father to rush over and activate the brake. Her children were safe. Deadly: The family SUV. It had been left parked with its engine running on the edge of a cliff over a canyon, while the family got ready to drive home to Texas from Colorado. Disaster struck when the three children jumped into the car and it slipped into gear, rolling towards the cliff . However, Joy was so severely injured that everybody thought she was going to die. Her children stood around her crying as the emergency services were called. 'The back tire basically went this way, and just crushed everything, my lungs, my ribs, my clavicle,' she recalled, speaking to PBS. 'I had my head tilted, and they said that's what saved my life as the tire went this way. My father put his hand on the brake before it went over the canyon and said, ""Joy, Joy, I got it!"" And then I remember hearing my mother scream, and then they ran to the back of the car and found me. 'I couldn't see because the blood vessels had broken in my eyes from the pressure of being run over, and so I told my dad. I said, I don't want to live, I said I'm blind and I'm paralyzed, I just want to die. 'And he said, no, no, no, don't say that, you don't want to die, don't say that. And so the next thing I remember is in a helicopter being flown. My family, they were a huge support. They're the reason I basically survived. They gave me the desire to keep living and to go on. 'It was like this voice said, ""you've got a choice here,' she told Oprah Winfrey. 'You can go in if you want to tell your kids goodbye and say those parting words, but if you want to fight, you've got to fight. 'And when I heard them screaming, I knew I had to fight.' This took place in 1999 - she first spoke to Oprah in 2004 - and since then much has changed. Her children, Chloe, 22, Annie, 20, and Elliot, 17, are thriving; Chloe has just graduated from Harvard, and Elliot says that his mother is his 'inspiration'. But Joy herself, now 46, will never walk again. 'After the show I went to Portugal because I'd really been searching for a cure,' she told Operah Winfrey this week, 11 years after the accident, on Oprah: Where are they now? (Sundays, 9 p.m. ET on OWN). 'That was pretty much my focus. I had a stem cell transplant and I went through surgery... But it didn't make me walk again.' After years of arduous rehabilitation, there came a moment of realisation. 'I remember lying in my bed one day and being depressed and hearing my children playing outside,' she said. 'I remember thinking then, it's my choice. I can lie here and I can be depressed and I can miss out a lot in life. 'Or I could learn to walk again. Maybe not walk in the physical sense, but walk in life.' Happy ending: The family are trying to put the pain of the accident, and the subsequent divorce, behind them and focus on the positive things in life. Joy Vernon, second from right, says 'I could learn to walk again. Maybe not walk in the physical sense, but walk in life' Proud: Joy Veron with her daughters Chloe, 22 (left), and Annie, 20 (right). Both girls are incredibly proud of their mother, and Annie says that she 'does more than most moms do' That was exactly what she did. Her younger daughter, Annie, 20, said this week that her mother was more active than most other parents. 'Honestly she hasn't let her wheelchair stop her from anything,' she said. 'I actually think she does more than most moms do.' The accident continues to cast a long shadow over their lives, however. When she was going through rehabilitation, Joy recalled, a doctor told her that 99.2 per cent of marriages 'do not make it' after the woman suffers a serious injury. After 23 years of marriage, Joy and her husband also become two more victims of this statistic. Recalling their recent divorce was the only moment that Joy broke down in tears during the interview. 'I'm hurt,' she said. 'I think that in the beginning, we should have had major counselling. That would have helped a lot. 'Unfortunately, we didn't. I think we were so caught up in my rehab and trying to get me better than we didn't pay enough attention to what he was going through.' But if there is one thing she has learnt from her experience, it is guts. 'It's life,' she said. 'I know it's something I'll make it through.' Then again, her heroic act of 11 years ago shows that she was full of guts already. Together: Joy Veron, centre, with her daughter Annie, 20, left, and her son Elliot, 17, right.

"Apology: David Duckenfield says he never had the chance to say sorry over the Hillsborough disaster . The police chief on duty during the Hillsborough disaster today said that he had never previously apologised for lying to officials because he had 'never found an opportunity' to do so. David Duckenfield told the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans during the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989 that he had not spoken out because was worried about being misrepresented. The former officer also admitted he was 'possibly in denial' over his misleading statement that a gate had been forced open by fans, leading to a deadly crush on the terraces of the Sheffield stadium. He told the jury he was a Freemason at the time of the accident, but said he hoped that was not a factor in his promotion to the position of chief superintendent. And he denied taking part in a 'cover-up' designed to divert blame from the police by ascribing the disaster to Liverpool fans' bad behaviour. Yesterday, Mr Duckenfield said he 'apologised unreservedly' to the families of the victims who were killed in the opening minutes of the game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Shortly before kick-off the officer - who had never previously overseen a major football match - ordered a gate to be opened in order to ease overcrowding outside the ground, but this allowed fans to rush into to already packed terraces. When fans started dying, Mr Duckenfield told Football Association officials that 'some fans have got in through a gate', which he now admits was a 'terrible lie'. Rajiv Menon QC, lawyer for the victims' families, asked him why it took him 26 years to 'come clean' over his 'critical mistakes'. Mr Duckenfield, 70, replied: 'I was possibly in denial and I never found a venue or an opportunity where I could meet with someone and speak to them honestly and openly and ensure that my thought and my feelings would be reported fairly. 'Yesterday this court gave me the opportunity to sit here and apologise fully for the first time without fear of anybody misrepresenting what I was saying.' Crush: 96 Liverpool fans were killed by being pushed up against barriers on the overcrowded terrace . He denied saying anything inaccurate to FA officials Graham Kelly and Glen Kirton, but confessed he had told a 'lie by omission' for failing to mention that he gave the order to open the gate, and added that it was his family who told him what he had done. He said: 'I have spoken to my family, who are genuine people, and I have said I am troubled by this situation and they said to me, ""Well you obviously lied because you didn't tell the whole truth.""' Mr Duckenfield, who was promoted to be an area commander at South Yorkshire Police two weeks before the semi-final, told the jury that he was not a 'reasonably competent match commander' due to his lack of experience. Asked if he was a member of the Freemasons at the time of the disaster, Mr Duckenfield said, 'I was,' adding that he had joined the organisation in 1975 and was made Worshipful Master of his local lodge in 1990. He said he did not know whether the chief constable of his force or other senior officers were in the Masons because it was not seen as 'acceptable' to be a senior policeman and a Freemason. Mr Menon asked if Mr Duckenfield's promotion to chief superintendent in March 1989 was anything to do with his membership of the Masons. He replied: 'I would not know but I would hope not. Nobody ever spoke to me about it.' At one point Mr Menon put it to Mr Duckenfield that there had been a 'false narrative' after the disaster which sought to blame Liverpool fans for what had happened and conceal the truth about police failings. After pausing to consider his answer, Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I disagree. There was no conspiracy as far as I am concerned.' Rejecting claims that he suspected there were fatalities by the time he spoke to Mr Kelly, Mr Duckenfield added: 'I don't think I was involved in any cover-up whatsoever. 'My main objective was a rescue operation and to do the very best I could for all concerned. It was chaotic, hectic, stressful.' Chaos: Fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster . After claiming that no one in the court room would understand the position he found himself in, Mr Duckenfield was asked why he had concealed the truth from Mr Kelly. 'Sir, I said yesterday, I don't know,' Mr Duckenfield responded. Mr Menon then said to the former officer: 'That's not the way that a competent match commander behaves, is it Mr Duckenfield, lying to the chief executive of the Football Association when people are dying on the pitch feet away?' Mr Duckenfield answered: 'Sir, under normal circumstances, as I have said, outside in the street or in an office, it is not the normal way you would expect. 'But we are not talking about normal circumstances, we are talking about a massive tragedy and me doing my best under very difficult circumstances.' Asked if he had always been consistent in his account of what he said in the control box, the former chief superintendent said: 'It may be that my recollections over 26 years, or what I have said about Mr Kelly, may vary, and, dare I say it, understandably.' Mr Menon later asked: 'Your negligence caused disaster and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, didn't it?' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I would not use the word negligence. Mistake, oversight. Sir, I did not foresee the consequence.' Mr Menon said that the former officer's failure to close the tunnel before opening the gates was a, 'blunder of the first magnitude.' Mr Duckenfield said, 'I can't deny it,' adding: 'I'm not making excuses, I have nothing to cover up, I have put my hands up and admitted my failings and I will continue to do so.' The officer told jurors he 'came clean' about giving the order to open the gate at about 4pm after returning to the control box from a visit to Hillsborough's boardroom. Whilst in the boardroom - in the presence of directors from Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool - Mr Duckenfield again failed to mention that he had authorised the gate to be opened. After leaving the ground and travelling to South Yorkshire Police headquarters on the evening of April 15, Mr Duckenfield said he was summoned to brief Chief Constable Peter Wright. Mr Menon asked Mr Duckenfield how the chief constable had reacted when he was informed that the head of the FA had been lied to. Mr Duckenfield said: 'Sir, I think the best answer to that is that he was very unhappy overall. I remember walking into his office. 'He was sat behind his desk and he wasn't best pleased about the events. I just remember having related my story to him and being dismissed like a schoolboy out of the headmaster's office.' Asked about the testimony he gave to the initial Taylor Inquiry into the disaster, a few months after the match, Mr Duckenfield said he 'should not have been giving evidence' because he was traumatised. He also suggested that post-traumatic stress disorder had affected his memory of events. The hearing continues tomorrow.

"British families now have more cash to spend  after tax than before the Coalition came to power, official figures revealed this morning. The boost, just 37 days before the election, came as separate figures showed that Britain's economy grew faster than any other major rich country in the world last year. People's confidence in their own finances also jumped to complete a 'hat trick of good news' for David Cameron and George Osborne this morning. Scroll down for video . In the final three months of the year, families had £4,187 to spend or save – finally overtaking the £4,187 families had left over at the time of the last election . Britain's economy grew faster than any other major rich country in the world last year, official figures revealed this morning . The Office for National Statistics said the UK economy grew 0.6 per cent in the last three months of the year – 0.1 per cent more than previously thought. But over the whole of 2014, the economy boomed by 2.8 per cent –  faster than America, Germany, France and every other country in the G7 group of rich countries. Mr Osborne said the revised figures show the UK is 'clearly fastest growing major advanced economy' in the world. Separate figures released this morning revealed that in the final three months of the year, the average voter had £4,187 left over after tax, up 1.8 per cent on the previous quarter. Mr Osborne said this meant that living standards were now officially higher than at the last election, when real disposable income was £4,187. The Chancellor said: 'Today we've got a hat-trick of good news about the British economy and with 37 days to go the election it's another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk.' The Chancellor George Osborne, pictured at a Pizza Express restaurant in Hove this morning, claimed the economic figures were a triple dose of good news . David Cameron was out campaigning at a building site at Sainsbury's head office in Holborn, central London, this morning . The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew 0.6 per cent in the last three months of the year – 0.1 per cent more than previously thought . He added: 'We've had a significant upgrade to GDP, the highest consumer confidence for over 12 years and confirmation that living standards are higher than they were at the last election. 'This is good news for families and businesses across the country. 'So voters now face a stark choice: do we stick with a plan which is working, delivering growth and jobs, or do we put all that at risk with Ed Miliband whose policies of more spending, more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos.' GDP per head – the wealth of each Briton rather than the economy as a whole – was also estimated to have increased in the last three months of the year – jumping by a healthy 0.5 per cent. Lib Dem Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander added: 'As we approach the General Election, this upward revision in GDP is further evidence that our recovery plan is working.' But the shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Tory claims that the economy was fixed would 'ring hollow with working people'. He said: 'A small upward revision today in the GDP figures doesn't change that overall record. This has been a disappointing recovery and it didn't have to be this way. 'If the Conservatives want to go round and say 'Our plan is working, look at the GDP figures; our plan is working, look at the figures on disposable income' then we say bring it on because the reality is that this is the toughest squeeze on people's living standards in a parliament since the early 1920s.' He added: 'I don't think that just crossing your fingers and hoping for the best is good enough.'","British families now have more cash to spend after tax than in 2010 .

'It was bittersweet - a really good time, but very sad,' she said of her last day on set. 'Lots of tears.' While she will no doubt miss her co-stars Jon Hamm, who plays her dad Don Draper, and January Jones, who plays her mom Betty Francis, on set, Kiernan is especially sorry to leave her own on-screen alter-ego behind. 'Sally is very strong and independent. Very perceptive too.' she said. 'I don't think she'd want to be friends with me, but I'd love to be friends with her!' Family drama: The show has followed Sally Draper's personal story more as the character has gotten older, giving Kiernan increasing screen time over the course of the whole show . Growing up in the spotlight: Viewers have watched Kiernan grow from a little girl, seen here in 2009, into a teenager . She even takes getting mistaken for Sally in real life as a compliment; the actress says many fans will tell her they hate her parents or want to give  Kiernan - meaning Sally, her oft-emotionally-neglected character - a hug. But while on-screen Kiernan is meticulously dressed in vintage-style clothing by Mad Men costume designer Janie Bryant - who the actress describes as 'so brilliant' - off-screen the star likes to experiment with clothes and accessories on her own. She describes her personal style as 'fun and simple,' but will switch out her everyday overalls and sneakers for glamorous designer dresses and heels on the red carpet. Designer darling: The actress wore a Miu Miu dress, shoes and bag to a party celebrating the final seven episodes of Made Men on March 25 . 'I really, really love Miu Miu. It’s so fun and youthful,' Kiernan, who regularly attends A-list fashion industry events, said of one of her favorite designers. Luckily, the actress will still have plenty of occasions to dress up for the red carpet even after the last seven episodes of Mad Men end this spring, with several more projects on the horizon. Later this year, Kiernan will star in Fan Girl with Meg Ryan and February alongside Emma Roberts.","The actress, 15, has been reminiscing about the 'bittersweet' last days on set .

"A Chinese woman whose knees bent the wrong way has been able to take her first steps - at the age of 26. Chen Tuanzhi was born with congenital genu recurvatum disease, or 'backward-bending knee,' which left her unable to walk or lie down straight. Her family Xiamen, in southeast China's Fujian Province, were too poor to pay for corrective treatment so she would use her hands to pull her body along the ground. Rare: Chen Tuanzhi has serious congenital gen recurvatum disease which left her legs pointing in an L-shape . Major strides: She was able to take her first steps at the age of 26 after charities paid for a series of medical procedures . Villagers even referred to her as the 'crawling girl,' the People's Daily Online reports. But after local media covered her story, enough money was raises to pay for medical treatment to be carried out by specialists in Taiwan. Chen's mother said before her daughter's treatment, she had grown used to the disability but was still upset by the comments and stares of people in public. Straight at last: Chen Tuanzhi was born with congenital genu recurvatum disease which caused her knees to bend backwards. She had several operations to make them straight . On her feet: Chen Tuanzhi was known in her village as the 'crawling girl' as she could not walk. She spent months recovering after several operations . Proud moment: Chen Tuanzhi, who was born with a serious deformity that left her unable to walk, takes her first steps in front of delighted onlookers . Despite her disability, she managed to gain a place and graduate from her local school and is now at college studying social work and management. Genu recurvatum loosely translates as 'backward-bending knee.' It is a rare condition with an incidence rate of approximately 1 per 100,000 live births and is characterised by congenital hyperextension of the knee with limited flexibility . It occurs more often in females than in males. Untreated, it leads to increased tissue damage and can cause permanent deformity, making timely diagnosis and treatment are essential. Depending upon the type and severity of the condition, it may be treated with physical therapy, a knee support, leg braces or surgery. Her studies caught people's attention and the Xiamen Charity Federation and Taiwan's Tzu Chi foundation offered to fund her treatment. She underwent seven operations and 10 months' treatment at Taiwan's Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital before going home to walk for the first time. 'To be honest, I never really dreamed that I would one day be able to stand on my own two feet and even walk like other people,' she said. 'It is more than a dream come true, it is a miracle. 'I was so happy when I had people to see me off at the airport and I was able to tell them I was now ready for the walk back home.' Chen Yinghe, honorary President of the Taiwan's Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, said that Chen's disease, which has been reported only twice in the world so far, had posed a great medical challenge. He said: 'The girl's legs have never been normally used since she was born so there are lots of factors that are out of our control in the wound healing process.' Simple pleasures: Chen makes a peace sign while riding in her family's car. She was not able to sit straight before her surgery . Time to go: Chen poses for the camera while sat on a toilet - something she could not do while her knees were back-to-front . Grateful: Chen stands proudly with the team of doctors who helped her walk for the first time in 26 years . Chen  now proudly stands at 4ft tall, 30 centimetres taller than she measured previously. A volunteer from the foundation said she showed a lot of courage throughout the treatment, which would have been incredibly painful. He said: 'Chen always smiled at others and never complained about the pain caused by the surgeries, including several that involve breaking her bones.'","Chen Tuanzhi, 26, was born with 'backward-bending knee' condition .

"A U.S. Air Force veteran . has been charged with attempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS after watching their online propaganda videos, the Department of Justice announced today. Tairod Nathan . Webster Pugh, 47, was indicted by a grand jury in Brooklyn on Monday for allegedly attempting to provide material support to the group and attempting to obstruct justice. Pugh is an American citizen who previously served as an avionics instrument system specialist in the Air Force. His most recent address according to property records was in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Authorities say he tried to join ISIS earlier this year, weeks after being fired from his job as an airplane mechanic in Kuwait. Scroll down for video . Arrest: The image is believed to show Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, a U.S. Air Force Veteran who was arrested in January for allegedly attempting to enter Syria to join ISIS. He has now been indicted . On January 10, he allegedly flew from Egypt to Turkey with the intention of crossing the Syrian border to 'fight violent jihad' with ISIS - but Turkish authorities denied him entry and sent him on a flight back to Egypt. Once there, he was found to be carrying suspicious items, including a cell phone photograph of a machine gun  and multiple electronic items, and was deported to the U.S. in January 15. FBI agents allegedly found he had been using his laptop to watch ISIS propaganda videos online and to search for such phrases including 'borders controlled by Islamic state'. They also found a chart on the computer showing crossing points between Turkey and Syria indicating areas on the Syrian side of the border controlled by ISIS. There were also online searches for 'Flames of War', a 55-minute propaganda video, and other footage, including one of ISIS members executing prisoners. Agents also searched two backpacks he used overseas and found they contained compasses, a solar-powered flashlight, a solar-powered power source, a fatigue jacket and camping clothes. Pugh (not pictured) flew from Egypt to Turkey in January with the intention of crossing into Syria to join ISIS (a member is pictured) but he was stopped and sent back to Egypt. From there he was deported to the U.S. Pugh, who told authorities he has a wife in Egypt, was arrested in Asbury Park, New Jersey on January 16 and has been in custody since. The case has been sealed during that time. Pugh is set to be arraigned before a federal judge tomorrow morning in the Eastern . District of New York, where his attorney said he plans to plead not guilty, CNN reported. If convicted of the charges, he faces a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison. Pugh served in the Air Force between 1986 to 1990 and, while there, received training in the installation and maintenance of aircraft engine, navigation, and weapons systems. When he left, he worked for a number of companies in the U.S. and Middle East as an avionics specialist and airplane mechanic. He had been living the Middle East for at least 18 months. His LinkedIn profile shows he last worked as a maintenance manager for the U.S. carrier Gryphon Airlines. Outrage: U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, pictured in January, said Pugh 'turned his back on his country' A Facebook page that appears to belong to him contains multiple anti-Israel photos, calling it 'terrorist country', and anti-Semitic images. In August 2014, he also shared quotes from famous Al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki on the page. His social networking pages also suggests he has two children with a former partner and he was pictured visiting them last year. Still, he wrote on the page that he never wanted to return to the U.S. 'Born and raised in the United States, Pugh allegedly turned his back on his country and attempted to travel to Syria in order to join a terrorist organization,' U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. 'We will continue to vigorously prosecute extremists, whether based here or abroad, to stop them before they are able to threaten the United States and its allies.' Assistant Director in Charge Diego G. Rodriguez of the FBI's New York Field Office added: 'U.S. citizens who offer support to terrorist organizations pose a grave threat to our national security and will face serious consequences for their actions.'","Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh was indicted by a grand jury in Brooklyn on Monday and will be arraigned on Wednesday morning .
