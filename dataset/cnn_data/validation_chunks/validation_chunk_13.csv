"Paul Pogba's agent Mino Raiola is '99 per cent' sure the Juventus star will reject the chance of sealing a summer move to the likes of Manchester United or Chelsea in order to stay at the Serie A champions. The former Manchester United midfielder has been linked with a move to several of Europe's top sides during the last few months, however Raiola insists his client is keen on staying at the Juventus Stadium. Raiola also revealed the seven clubs who are have stated their interest in the Frenchman - with Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea all said to be keeping a close eye on the 21-year-old's situation at Juventus. Paul Pogba's agent Mino Raiola is almost certain his client will stay at Juventus beyond the current campaign . Pogba has been linked with a summer move to the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City . 'We made a pact with Juve: Paul doesn’t have to leave,' Raiola told Tuttosport. 'I spoke to president Andrea Agnelli, directors Pavel Nedved, Beppe Marotta and Fabio Paratici, so they all agree. The club doesn’t need the money. 'At this moment the situation at Juve is ideal for Pogba. We would only leave if a situation emerged that was favourable for all concerned. 'He is wanted by seven clubs and that is certain, because they all told me so. The ones that can afford him are Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea. 'If I just whistled, I’d sell Pogba tomorrow to PSG or City in a heartbeat. But Paul did not tell me to find him another club. 'What are his chances of staying? As of today it’s 99 per cent. Juve agree with our approach, which is that they will only sell if Paul asks to leave and there’s a suitable offer. Of course, it could become one per cent, it depends on the market.' The 21-year-old joined Juventus in 2012 after leaving Manchester United on a free transfer .","Paul Pogba has been linked with a move back to the Premier League .

"When Oscar Garcia quit as manager of Maccabi Tel Aviv last summer he cited the prospect of Islamic militant rockets flying over the club training ground as a reason to leave. As reasons go, it’s as good as it gets. The man that succeeded him though, was undeterred. Indeed, former Liverpool coach Pako Ayestaran has never been afraid of taking bold steps. At Valencia, when trusted assistant to Rafa Benitez, he was the man who encouraged Benitez to move to Liverpool when the opportunity arose. ‘I was a Liverpool fan,’ says Ayestaran. ‘As a boy I had seen their team in 1975, with Toshack and Keegan, beat Real Sociedad 9-1 and it stuck with me. When I heard Rafa had the chance to go, I said he had to take it.’ Pako Ayestaran (right) alongside Rafael Benitez during their time at Liverpool . Ayestaran was assistant manager under Benitez at Valencia and Liverpool . Equally, when he felt Benitez had lost sight of what made their partnership so good, Ayestaran left Liverpool. Their friendship was fractured and never repaired but Ayestaran used those early principles to forge his own management career. When Maccabi sports director Jordi Cruyff called about moving to Tel Aviv, Ayestaran sensed an opportunity; not one of danger and trepidation but a challenge he could relish. ‘It is similar to when I was a young man in the 70s and 80s in the Basque country in Spain,’ says Ayestaran. ‘I was living with the threat of ETA, the Basque separatists, and bombs every day. People would call and ask ‘’are you ok there?’’ And you’d say ‘’yes I’m off to the park’’ or ‘’I’m having a cup of coffee’’. In my mind, life was normal. Ayestaran takes training at Maccabi Tel Aviv . ‘Tel Aviv is different to the north of Israel. If conflict starts it is normally on the West Bank or Jerusalem but not so much here. ‘It has been peaceful since the ceasefire was agreed in August. I can lead a normal life here. As normal as in London or Paris. The quality of life here is amazing. I will take my son to play tennis later and on Thursday I am going to the opera.’ Today, Ayestaran is eating lunch at a bistro on the Tel Aviv promenade. He looks trim, sharply dressed and sunglasses protect him from the glare of bright sunshine as the Mediterranean Sea laps over the busy beach. He has embraced Cruyff’s challenge. Maccabi have won one trophy, the Toto Cup, and a 2-1 victory over Maccabi Haifa on Monday means they are still on course for a domestic treble for the first time in their 109 year history. It is clear the methods Ayestaran practised at Anfield and since with last club Tecos in Mexico are having an effect. ‘One thing I learned is that you have to listen to your staff,’ Ayestaran says pointedly. He succeeded former boss Oscar Garcia as manager of Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel . Ayestaran (third left) was part of the Liverpool set up that helped them to Champions League victory in 2005 . ‘You may have your own ideas and make a different decision but the people around you are there for a reason and it’s important you account for that in your management and coaching. ‘Expectation is high here because of the club’s history but I’m not afraid of that. You have to take responsibility. It’s the evolution of a team, increasing the levels. I set a target of winning the treble early on and that brings pressure but that’s a pressure I’m happy with. 'The Israeli people are passionate about their football and it’s a release in many ways from what else goes on in life here.’ Football remains Israel’s most popular sport along with basketball and swimming. Israel top their group in the European Championship qualifiers and host Wales on Saturday. Maccabi have four players in the squad, one, attacking midfielder Eran Zehavi, has been the subject of interest from Tottenham and Borussia Dortmund while Crystal Palace tried to sign him in January. He has scored 31 goals this season already. Maccabi Tel Aviv manager Ayestaran giving orders to his team . ‘It’s a gift for Maccabi to have him at the club,’ says Ayestaran. ‘A player with the right character to take this club one step forward. He could certainly succeed in the Premier League.’ The 52-year-old Ayestaran retains a strong interest in English football where he is also drawing attention from clubs looking at foreign coaches. He has kept his house, a stone’s throw away from the Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Wirral, and is still in contact with the likes of Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard. They met up for lunch on a recent trip back to the UK. ‘We had a glass of wine and talked about football,’ says Ayestaran. ‘They are great characters. Jamie is like a sponge for information, he soaks up everything. I can remember at Liverpool when he was in the treatment room and he was having a debate about who played right-back in the 1974 FA Cup final. 'He approaches everything with such passion. I can see him coaching one day. Steven is also so passionate about the game and the project he is taking on in Los Angeles. When I arrived at Liverpool I think they were both a little unsure; they’d give their opinions but they listened and had respect for what we wanted to do. 'It made them think more about what they were doing as players and they are great students of the game. Their personalities are strong and they helped coaches to set the standard at Liverpool. For them the club came first.’ Ayestaran has backed his friend and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher to move into coaching . The former Liverpool assistant is also still in contact with Reds captain Steven Gerrard . While his bond with many of the friends he made in Liverpool is intact, Ayestaran admits regret that his relationship with Benitez remains broken. The pair won promotion at Tenerife, two Spanish titles with Valencia and the Champions League at Liverpool. ‘It’s sad that we haven’t spoken. We had a lot of very good moments and it’s better to remember those than the bad, life is too short.’ Ayestaran though is making confident strides as the main man. After Benitez, he took time out to learn from coaches such as Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola, had a short spell as director of football at Real Sociedad and spent time with Porto. ‘I’ve found it a natural transition,’ he says. ‘I needed my own project. It’s important that clubs have a model like Porto where even if change in personnel comes, and sometimes frequently, the model, the belief remains.’ And could he see himself in England again soon? ‘It’s the place I enjoy the most and my sons still consider England home. I would love that one day but for now my focus is Maccabi Tel Aviv - then maybe England can be my next chapter.’","Pako Ayesteran took over from  Oscar Garcia at Maccabi Tel Aviv .

"PFA chairman Ritchie Humphreys says the players' union supports Greg Dyke's proposals to increase homegrown talent in the Premier League. Dyke – the FA chairman who also heads the commission tasked with improving the national team – revealed this week that he wants to increase the minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12. He also wants to redefine 'homegrown' as three years spent at a club before a player's 18th birthday, not his 21st as it currently stands. PFA chairman Ritchie Humphreys pictured playing for Chesterfield in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy . And Humphreys, who is also a member of the FA Commission, told Sportsmail: 'Any foreign player who comes to this country we welcome to the Union. 'But we also have a duty of care to our national game and to homegrown players and their development. 'Everything we are working towards on the FA Commission is with the aim of making our national side more competitive at elite level. 'The PFA supports that. We want to see homegrown players – such as Harry Kane – given that chance at first-team level. Greg Dyke's proposals to increase homegrown talent in the Premier League has been backed by Humphreys . Dyke wants to redefine 'homegrown' as three years spent at a club before a player's 18th birthday . 'The proposals will make clubs think differently about recruitment and will hopefully see more homegrown players given game-time. 'I got my opportunity when I was 18 at Sheffield Wednesday in the Premier League. I probably had a bit of good fortune as well, but the opportunity was there and we want that pathway to be there for players of this generation. 'The best foreign players will still play in the Premier League – this does not mean no foreign players, far from it. 'But there were 83 non-homegrown players who played less than 10 games last season, and we feel that number could be reduced.'","FA chairman Greg Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12 .

"It is the game which, ultimately, could define the success or otherwise of Martin O’Neill and Roy Keane’s expensive Republic of Ireland tenure. Installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago, £1million-per-year O’Neill and his assistant Keane, with a £600,000 salary, were given a remit of qualification for Euro 2016, a task made easier by the expansion to a 24-team format. Defeat against Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday evening, however, would all but end hope of automatic progression to the finals in France, leaving Ireland to do battle with Scotland for the play-off berth. The mood here is not optimistic. Martin O'Neill, manager of the Republic of Ireland, needs to prove his worth with victory over Poland . O'Neill and Roy Keane (left) were given big salaries and asked to reach the 2016 European Championships . An inquest, you feel, awaits O’Neill and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders. One newspaper described their manager as ‘bookish and vaguely befuddled’, and noted the ‘carnage’ which follows Keane. There has been a definite effort to play down the chaos around Keane this week and the No 2 gave an untypically subdued and low-key performance in front of the press. O’Neill ignored the opinion pieces which have called into question his impact since he arrived and kept all talk to football. He said: ‘The importance of the occasion should not be missed. Defeat would be a big dent in our hopes of automatic qualification. It might not decide everything, but it is very significant. We have to try to win. If the Republic of Ireland fail to beat Poland, their hopes of automatic qualification will be all but over . O'Neill and Keane take a training session at Gannon Park as the team prepare for Sunday's big match . ‘I’ve said all along that the home games will shape our destiny. This is the first of that group. We have to make them count. ‘We can change all of that (negative talk) with one result and one fantastic performance. We will not get very far with a pessimistic approach and I’m not overly concerned with what people say before the game. ‘We have given ourselves a chance (of qualification) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match.’ One criticism of O’Neill is that he does not know his preferred XI or, indeed, formation. He said this week that players could win a starting place should they impress at their coastal training base in Malahide. Keane hands out instructions to the Republic of Ireland players during a training session . Sunday's game takes place at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin; the Republic of Ireland's home ground . One player not guaranteed to start is captain Robbie Keane. He was dropped for the morale-shattering 1-0 defeat in Scotland in November. The LA Galaxy striker, 34, said: ‘That’s up to the manager (if I play). ‘I’ll be ready whether that’s from the bench or starting. I’m the captain, I have to set an example. ‘But I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think I could make a difference. I still want to be the best. I have that hunger.’ Keane, sensing the air of negativity, added: ‘It’s up to us to make this a turning point. Victory would give this squad and country a huge confidence boost.’ Lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for O’Neill before they host Scotland. Win, and that £1m salary would look like a shrewd investment.","Republic of Ireland face Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday .

"West Ham chairman David Gold is 'hopeful' Winston Reid will snub Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal by signing a new contract. The New Zealand central defender is out of contract this summer and had looked set for a move to Tottenham on a £60,000-a-week deal while Arsenal also showed an interest. Talks between West Ham and Reid have led to a contract offer and, with the club sitting ninth in the Barclays Premier League, the 26-year-old is close to agreeing to stay. Winston Reid looks set to sign a new deal at West Ham after being linked with a move away in the summer . Reid was linked with a move at the end of the season to either Tottenham Hotspur or Arsenal . Reid has been at West Ham since 2010 after joining from Danish club FC Midtjylland . In reply to a question on Twitter about whether Reid will stay, Gold replied: 'I am hopeful that Winston will sign for us.' It would reflect another step forward for West Ham as they look to qualify for Europe this season, despite losing 3-1 against Crystal Palace at home on Saturday.

"Mike Tyson has warned Floyd Mayweather that he will have to reinvent himself as a boxer if he is to beat Manny Pacquiao in the richest fight of all time. Iron Mike, as he celebrates the 30th anniversary of the first fight of his own phenomenal career, predicts that the Money Man will lose to the PacMan unless he steps out from behind his masterly defence and comes to fight in Las Vegas on May 2. The casino odds-makers have installed Mayweather as favourite and opinion in boxing is divided approximately along the lines of the 60-40 purse split in favour of the Money man. Mike Tyson believes Floyd Mayweather's tactical style will work against him against Manny Pacquiao . Mayweather (left) will fall to the Pac-Man unless he steps out from behind his masterly defence on May 2 . Mayweather meets Pacquiao in the richest fight of all time and the boxing community is split on who will win . But Tyson says: ‘I thought from the start that Paquiao is going to win. This guy is perpetual motion. He comes from every angle. He’s all energy. Always throwing punches. Never stops. ‘Floyd tucks in and picks his shots and he is more accurate. But he doesn’t throw anything like Manny’s hundred punches a round. ‘It’s unlikely he can knock Manny out so if he wants to win he’s got to change. Unless he throws more punches he can’t win the rounds.’ Mayweather, at this Wednesday’s official, show-bizzy launch of the $350 million to half-billion dollar promotion, made it clear that he regards this Fight of the Century as business usual, saying: ‘We’ve started training real well. Continuing to do what we always do. Doing what has won all our 47 fights.’ Mayweather has acknowledged that ‘we will both be the best boxer we possibly can because we both want to this fight more than any other in our careers.’ To which Tyson says: ‘Not enough. He’s gotta do something different. He needs to take a look at how the only opponents who have given Pacquiao trouble are Tim Bradley and Juan Manuel Marquez, who also throw a hundred a round.’ Tyson says Mayweather should be looking at the boxers who have troubled Pac-Man, including Juan Manuel Marquez who stopped the Filipino in 2012 at the venue he will fight the American at on May 2 . Tim Bradley was another busy fighter to get the better of Pacquiao, although Manny won last year's rematch . By his own formidable force of nature, Tyson naturally inclines towards the aggression in the ring which first exploded upon a startled world 30 years ago last Friday. Tyson is lifted by promoter Don King after his 1986 win over Trevor Berbick, one of 44 knock outs early on in his formidable 50-win career . As he embarked on his journey towards becoming the youngest world champion in heavyweight history at 21, Tyson entered the ring at the Plaza Convention Center in Albany, New York State as an 18-year-old and blasted out one Hector Mercedes in the first round. That was the first of his 44 knock outs in a 50 win career which also included two no decisions and subsided at the end into six defeats. Tyson, now 48 and successfully reinventing himself in movies, video games and one-man shows, also blew the hundreds of millions of dollars which Mayweather is now earning. And did he have let slip a startling secret about the massive earning power of the Money-PacMan collision? He said: ‘Floyd’s getting $250 million for one night’s work.’ He made that remark while promoting Champs, a feature-length documentary about the pitfalls as well as the thrills of the fight game in which he stars with arch-rival Evander Holyfield and which opens in US cinemas this Friday. The film is the focal point of Tyson’s campaign for Federal regulation of boxing. He says: ‘Ours is the only sport in which the participants are not protected by law. Tyson spoke while promoting Champs, a feature-length documentary about the pitfalls and thrills of boxing in which he stars with arch-rival Evander Holyfield - the film opens in US cinemas this Friday . ‘Boxers generally come from the poorest backgrounds. Many can’t read or write when they start out. People like me and Floyd earn hundreds of millions of dollars and sometimes don’t know what to do with it. ‘And what about those who still get no more than 20 grand a fight? They can still get exploited so much that when they need a brain scan they can’t afford it and by then there’s no-one else to pay for it.’ Will those cautionary words – coupled with memory of how Tyson battered his way from rags to riches to prison to bankruptcy and now to redemption – convince Mayweather to stop gambling and buying the most expensive cars and planes or Pacquiao to limit how much of his fortune he gives away to the poor in his native Philippines? Probably not.","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight on May 2 at the MGM Grand .

"Wales star George North wants to reward Warren Gatland's 'trust' in him after a challenging few months on the international circuit. Juggernaut wing North will win his 48th cap in Saturday's RBS 6 Nations showdown against unbeaten title favourites Ireland at the Millennium Stadium. And the 22-year-old's impressive display when Wales beat France in Paris 11 days ago suggests he is on the way back to recapturing top Test match form. Earlier this term, Wales head coach Gatland called for North to increase his involvement in games, and it did not go unnoticed.

Scrum-half Rhys Webb catches the ball in training ahead of Saturday's Six Nations showdown with Ireland . 'For me, it's never a good point if the head coach is not happy with you,' North said. 'That is when you start getting dropped and stuff. 'I felt that Paris was a step forward for me to where I want to be in a Welsh jersey, and hopefully on Saturday I can push forward again and reward his trust.' North has only scored one try in his last seven Tests - against Fiji last November - but at the Millennium Stadium it is a strike-rate of seven touchdowns from 10 starts during the past 16 months. Victory for Wales this weekend would keep them in the Six Nations title mix heading for an appointment with Italy in Rome next week, but recent history suggests that Ireland occupy the box-seat. They have beaten Wales in each of the last two Six Nations campaigns, scoring an aggregate 56 points, while Joe Schmidt's men are currently on an Irish record-equalling run that has realised 10 successive Test wins. North is tackled by England's Jonathan Joseph (left) and Anthony Watson (right) during the Six Nations match . 'If you look at Ireland over the last couple of years in this fixture, they have just been clinical,' North added. 'Over the past two years they have been very good at finishing games off. They take their chances when they can, and we have lacked that composure when it has come to the crunch. 'They are 10 (wins) from 10, which is unbelievable. 'They have got a lot of confidence now, they execute their game-plan very well and they are a side that knows what they want to do and where they want to go, and everyone has bought into that ethos. 'We don't need to big the game up more than it is. It's a massive game for Ireland, going for the Grand Slam, and for us it will be a great Test match here in Cardiff.' North (pictured here in 2014) will win his 48th cap for Wales if he plays against Ireland at the weekend . Wales, meanwhile, will be captained by flanker Sam Warburton for the 34th time as he overtakes Ryan Jones' Welsh record, and North said: 'It's exceptional for Sam. 'He is a quality player and leads from the front, and as a captain you cannot ask for any more. 'With someone like Sam it's not necessarily what he says, it's the actions he does. He is the kind of man who will never ask you to do something he wouldn't do himself. 'In training, he is not someone who stands up and gives a 20-minute speech and everyone gets up and starts screaming. 'It's more of a kind of chat that is to the point and is no more or no less than what it needs to be.'

"Northern Ireland's Jonathan Rea claimed back-to-back race victories at the inaugural Thailand leg of the World Superbike Championship on Sunday. Rea, on his Kawasaki ZX-10R, enjoyed a dominant weekend in Buriram, firstly taking pole positions and then clinching consecutive lights-to-flag victories on race day. The wins lifted Rea 10 points clear of nearest rival Leon Haslam at the top of the early-season standings, with 95 points from a possible 100 following this weekend's masterclass and a first and second place in Australia four weeks ago.

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew believes English football does not have enough black managers and coaches – and wants the ‘jobs for the boys’ culture out of the game. Palace face Queens Park Rangers in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off at Selhurst Park and their manager Chris Ramsey is the only ethnic minority boss in the Barclays Premier League. Pardew wants clubs to work on encouraging ethnic minority coaches to reflect the huge variety of cultures that players in England come from, rather than employing the same “boys club” members. Palace manager Alan Pardew believes that English football isn't doing enough to include black coaches . Chris Ramsey, QPR boss, is the only black coach in the top flight - and one of just six in the Football League . Ramsey is one of just six black or ethnic minorities bosses in the Football League, along with Huddersfield Town boss Chris Powell, Brighton’s Chris Hughton, Carlisle manager Keith Curle, Leyton Orient boss Fabio Liverani and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink with Burton Albion. ‘He (Ramsey) is black, which I think is great for the Premier League,’ Pardew said. ‘It’s something that I want to promote here in terms of our coaches, because the percentage of players we have to percentage of coaches in terms of origin isn’t right.’ Palace employ just ‘three or four’ black coaches, according to Pardew and in future recruitment he plans to change that, while backing the idea of a ‘Rooney Rule’ as seen in American Football where a black coach is considered for every job. ‘I’m going to keep approaching when vacancies come up and make sure that we are covering every kind of opportunity in terms of applications that come in,’ he said. ‘It isn’t “jobs for the boys” here anymore, I’m not saying it was, but sometimes it does go like that. Ramsey takes a coaching session at the QPR training ground this week ahead of his side's trip to Palace . Former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is currently managing League Two outfit Burton Albion . ‘I think something like that (the Rooney Rule) could be looked at. I also know the LMA and the PFA are really trying to encourage a more diverse approach to getting different creeds to come into the coaching world and I just want to take this opportunity to back that up. Pardew also looked to push forward the prospects of more Asian footballers coming into the game after signing South Korean winger Lee Chung-yong from Bolton Wanderers in the January transfer window. And Pardew says Palace, based in the ethnically diverse area of South Norwood outside London, owe it to their surroundings to be more culturally diverse. ‘I don’t want to talk just about Afro-Caribbean coaches either,’ he said. ‘We have an Asian player now in our first team. We don’t have a lot of that and that’s another area that we need to promote, Asian footballers in this area because there’s a lot of huge community here. ‘We need a greater influx of Indians, Afro-Caribbeans, entering our coaching system and getting jobs, so the proportions make sense.’ Crystal Palace signed Lee Chung-yong from Bolton Wanderers during the January transfer window .","Alan Pardew believes there should be more non-white managers .

"Chelsea will be forced to pay over £30million to lure Inter Milan striker Mauro Icardi to Stamford Bridge if they follow up their interest in the prolific Argentine. That's according to Inter's sporting director Piero Ausilio, who claims the Italian club would not sell the 22-year-old if they received a big money bid this summer. Premier League leaders Chelsea and Manchester United have both watched the former Sampdoria man, who has 14 goals in 24 Serie A games. Inter Milan striker Mauro Icardi (left) has been watched by Chelsea and Manchester United this season . Sporting director Piero Ausilio insists Inter would reject bids of £30million for their star striker Icardi . 'What if someone bids €40m (£30m) for him in the summer?,' Ausilio told Sky Sport. 'Well we've got no intention of doing business, we're thinking of the present and future of this football club with Icardi. 'Our intentions are clear. We're building a team to last for a long time with very talented, young players. 'As well as Mateo Kovacic and Icardi, we've added more quality players such as Marcelo Brozovic and Xherdan Shaqiri and we want to continue in this vein.' Icardi couldn't find the back of the net as Inter fell to a 1-0 defeat at home to Fiorentina on Sunday . Ausilio claims that Icardi is on the verge of signing a new contract at Inter, the club he joined back in 2013 . Ausilio also confirmed that Icardi is close to signing a new contract at the San Siro, giving the club more power when it comes to keeping him out of the clutches of Premier League clubs. Ausilio added: 'I was with his (Icardi's) agent until a few minutes ago, we're coming close to an agreement. Icardi will remain with us for much longer. 'Tomorrow (Tuesday) we will have another meeting, during which will a draft contract will be signed, before official deal, that will happen very soon.'","Manchester United and Chelsea have watched Mauro Icardi in action .

"It was supposed to be all about AP McCoy — the biggest name in jump racing on his final day riding at the Cheltenham Festival. But instead, Gold Cup day 2015 shone a spotlight on a jockey in Nico de Boinville who has ridden fewer winners in his career than the 19-time champion rides in three months. Carlingford Lough, 40-year-old McCoy’s final Gold Cup mount, finished a fading ninth behind Coneygree, the novice chaser representing 10-horse trainer Mark Bradstock and his assistant, wife Sara. Tony McCoy's wife Chanelle (left) passionately willed him on to claim his third Gold Cup victory . But her relentless optimism soon turned to sheer sadness as her husband crossed the finish like in ninth place . Jockey Tony McCoy could not crown his final Cheltenham Festival with a Gold Cup win . McCoy did get a Gold Cup round of applause but it came as he walked around the paddock before the race. Looking down at his friend and colleague Ruby Walsh, who had yet to be united with his Gold Cup ride Djakadam, McCoy quipped: ‘They think I’ve won.’ No, AP, they were just hoping. Ultimately, McCoy did get on the winner’s podium but that was to present the trophy to the team behind Next Sensation, winner of the concluding AP McCoy Grand Annual Chase. Not surprisingly, the Michael Scudamore-trained Next Sensation, ridden by Scudamore’s brother Tom, had received a quieter reception than McCoy’s fourth-placed Ned Buntline. A crowd close to 70,000 had cheered and chanted his name as McCoy brought his mount down the famous walkway off the track. There were not many who had sneaked away to beat the traffic. And while they did not get the result they wanted, McCoy did at least break the habit of a lifetime for them. The man for whom winning is the only thing that matters, punched and waved the air. The defeat of Carlingford Lough, however, came as no surprise. After the Gold Cup, McCoy conceded he had anticipated his fate on arriving at the track when overnight rain was turning the ground soft. Tony McCoy and Ned Buntline gave it a good go on the 19-time champion jockey's final Festival ride . An emotional McCoy after his last ever ride at the Cheltenham Festival . The big screen at Cheltenham displayed a tribute to the retiring jockey . ‘I knew when I got here this morning that it was always going to be against him,’ McCoy said. ‘He is a horse who likes good ground and it was always going to be too much of a drag. ‘For a horse who is slow he has a little bit of a kick at the end but not when the ground is like that.’ McCoy then paid generous tribute to the winning team. ‘The Bradstocks have done a wonderful job,’ he said. ‘They have proved that if they get the horse, they can do the job. To win the Gold Cup with a novice is a fantastic performance.’ For the uninitiated, a novice is a horse that had not won in a particular category — hurdles or steeplechase — before the start of the season. Even if it does then win a race, the horse remains a novice until the end of that season. Animals who record their first win in March or April may still contest novice events until October 31. As for McCoy, it was just one of those days as he failed to add to Thursday’s Ryanair Chase victory on Uxizandre, who goes down as his 31st and final Festival victory. Hargam, rated one of his best chances of the week but another wrong-footed by the rain, swung for home with a chance in the Triumph Hurdle but finished third behind Nicky Henderson stablemates Peace And Co and Top Notch. McCoy was presented with a photo album of his Cheltenham career after his final fling at the Festival . McCoy, in the middle of the picture, walks out of the Cheltenham weighing room for the last time . Strongly-backed Princely Conn was staying on when badly hampered and slipped back to 13th in the County Hurdle while Fletchers Flyer, McCoy’s mount in the Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle, was a non-runner. And just when McCoy wanted the racing gods to smile on him, they frowned instead as Ned Buntline was hindered by a faller four out. McCoy said: ‘All through the week people have been amazing and I appreciate it. I have always tried to look forward but now I am going to have to look backwards as I have nothing to look forward to.’ Five rides at Uttoxeter this afternoon, including the favourite in the Midlands National, will be on his mind this morning but his admiration for Coneygree and his team was well deserved. The 7-1 shot was in front at the first fence and never headed in a display of controlled jumping at speed that no rival could live with. Five of the 16 starters were pulled up, including 2013 winner Bobs Worth and last year’s victor Lord Windermere, who started at the back and never looked like defending his title. Last year’s runner-up On His Own was Coneygree’s closest pursuer for most of the race but faded to fourth. One by one they cracked as Coneygree saw off Djakadam and Road To Riches with the equine equivalent of a McCoy-type performance.","AP McCoy's final Gold Cup mount, Carlingford Lough, finished ninth .

"How refreshing it was to see Danny Welbeck properly celebrate scoring for Arsenal against former club Manchester United on Monday night. The striker's passion was clear to see as he bounded backwards across the Old Trafford turf, letting out a roar of celebration as Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla rushed over to celebrate the moment. 'The emotion takes over,' he said afterwards. 'It was difficult to keep it in.' Quite right too. Welbeck had every reason to celebrate and let all that pent-up frustration out. A pumped-up Danny Welbeck celebrates his winner for Arsenal at former club Manchester United . The Arsenal striker celebrates with team-mates Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla after scoring . At United since the age of eight, he was booted out the door in the summer by Louis van Gaal, who claimed he wasn't good enough to be a first team player at United. So, on his first return to Old Trafford, Welbeck had a major point to prove and when Antonio Valencia under-hit a back pass to goalkeeper David de Gea, he seized his chance. Skilfully taking the ball around the Spaniard, he passed it into an empty net before celebrating whole-heartedly but still with plenty of respect for the United fans. Welbeck could certainly teach these players, who took the whole not celebrating against a former club thing a little too seriously. Shaun Wright-Phillips (Chelsea vs QPR, January 2013) Wright-Phillips wasn't wanted by Chelsea. They spent £21m to sign him and then kept him as a bit-part player until finally ditching him three years later having wasted the best years of his career. So when the winger earned Queens Park Rangers an improbable win at Stamford Bridge during their 2013 relegation struggle, with his first league goal in nearly three years, you'd expect him to be thrilled. Nope. Wright-Phillips looked downright miserable, an island of indifference as his team-mates celebrated jubilantly around him. Shaun Wright-Phillips (third right) looked downright miserable after scoring for QPR at old club Chelsea . Adam Johnson (SUNDERLAND vs Manchester City, December 2012) Likewise with Johnson, who had great expectations when he joined Manchester City from Middlesbrough in 2010 but was barely given a chance by Roberto Mancini. Indeed, Johnson revealed when he escaped to Sunderland that he was barely on speaking terms with the Italian manager towards the end, having been dropped without explanation on a number of occasions during a turbulent two-and-a-half years. So when Johnson gained his revenge by scoring the winner against City a few months after leaving, you'd expect something a bit more animated than just a raised hand of apology. Adam Johnson consoles his former team-mate Joe Hart after scoring against him in December 2012 . Romelu Lukaku (West Brom vs EVERTON, September 2014) Opening your account for a new club, especially after a £28m move, should be kind of a big deal. But Lukaku looked embarassed that his maiden goal for Everton had come at West Brom, the club where he spent the 2012-13 season on loan from Chelsea. Still, at least he earned an appreciative round of applause from the Hawthorns crowd for his sheepish raised hand 'celebration.' Lukaku holds his hands up after scoring for Everton against West Brom, where he spent a year on loan . Jonjo Shelvey (Liverpool vs SWANSEA CITY, February 2014) Shelvey made 47 league appearances for Liverpool over the course of his three seasons there, scoring two goals. Hardly the stuff of Kop folklore. But the midfielder felt the need to apologise to the Anfield crowd after scoring a lovely 20-yard goal on his return there with Swansea last year. It did earn him a round of applause from the Liverpool fans though.

"QPR's Charlie Austin has hailed the 'exceptional form' of Tottenham forward Harry Kane, insisting the 21-year-old is a shining example of what confidence can do for a striker. Kane's two goals fired Spurs to a 2-1 win over Rangers on Saturday and took his personal tally to 26 goals in all competitions this season. Austin and Kane are both jostling for a spot in Roy Hodgson's England squad, which is announced later this month, but the QPR striker had only praise for his compatriot. QPR striker Charlie Austin has praised the 'exceptional form' of Spurs counterpart Harry Kane this season . Harry Kane, who scored twice for Tottenham at QPR on Saturday, has impressed Charlie Austin this season . Kane fires home Tottenham' second goal in the Premier League encounter at Loftus Road . 'Harry Kane has been in exceptional form this season,' Austin told paddypower.com. 'He was the difference between us and Tottenham on Saturday - and he is a great example of this self-belief. 'That brace makes it eight goals in six league games and when you're on that run you just want the games to keep coming. 'He's confident going into games, and he's confident when he's front of goal that he's going to score. 'That's the kind of confidence that a striker really wants and it will inevitably benefit the team.' Austin has enjoyed an excellent campaign himself, scoring 15 goals in his debut season in the top flight. Charlie Austin is also in England contention after scoring 15 Premier League goals this season . Charlie Austin's shot flies past Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris for a consolation goal on Saturday . A dip in form saw Austin score just once in seven matches at the start of the year but two goals in his last three games suggests the 25-year-old his rediscovering his rhythm. 'If you're a confident striker the ball will always fall to you in the right positions,' Austin said. 'If you're in form there's nothing stopping you picking the ball up 25 yards out and having a shot, whereas a striker low on confidence might play it out wide and be slightly more conservative. 'If you get the goal to kick-start the run, your self-belief keeps growing and you know you'll keep getting chances to score.' Austin is only five away from reaching the 20-goal mark in the league this season but the striker insists he has not set any targets. England manager Roy Hodgson monitored both Kane and Austin at Loftus Road on Saturday . 'I've never got into the habit of setting myself personal targets,' Austin added. 'If you set yourself a target you can give yourself something to achieve, but if you don't hit those aims you see yourself as a failure. 'For me that isn't a motivation. It was my first season in the Premier League this year and I wanted to go in all guns blazing and just see what I could do.'","Kane scored twice as Spurs beat QPR 2-1 at Loftus Road on Saturday .

Manager Chris Ramsey admitted that Austin, whose contract runs out at the end of next season, could leave in the summer, but is adamant they will not let him go for a paltry fee. Austin has been in red-hot form in his debut season in the Barclays Premier League with 15 goals — just behind Harry Kane on 16 and top scorers Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa on 17. The 25-year-old has played his way into contention when Roy Hodgson announces his England squad next week to play in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and friendly versus Italy later this month. Hodgson was at Loftus Road to see Austin score a fine strike against Arsenal 10 days ago, despite Rangers losing. Austin has been in red-hot form in his debut season in the Barclays Premier League with 15 goals . Austin celebrates scoring his second goal during the Premier League match against West Bromwich Albion . Ramsey admitted: ‘When somebody sparkles there’s always people in there to poach them or to buy them and make their clubs better. ‘So we would be foolish not to be worried we’re going to lose him. We hope we don’t and we’re glad he’s performed in a way that other teams are trying to secure his services. ‘He’s one of the top strikers in the country, it’s not my decision whether he stays or goes, but any top striker always goes for top dollar.’ QPR have opened talks with Austin over a new, £60,000-a-week deal, but he is keen to wait until the end of the season before making a decision. Austin has been offered a new deal at Loftus Road but will wait until the end of the season to make a decision . To make matters worse, the club’s financial accounts for the 2013-14 season when they were in the Championship, filed at Companies House on Friday, show that their ‘real’ losses last season were almost £70m. The Football League’s complex FFP rules are designed to discourage rich owners buying success and endangering the health of their clubs. A tariff of fines is in place for clubs that massively overspend. Earlier this month, QPR announced they had made a loss of £9.8m but the accounts now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of owners — mainly Tony Fernandes — wrote off £60m of old loans in an ‘exceptional item’ in the accounts. Qpr owners including Tony Fernandes wrote off £60million worth of old loans in the accounts . Effectively, QPR counted that write-off as extra income. But that money is noted in the accounts as being a ‘related-party transaction’ — and the Football League’s own FFP regulations explicitly rule out related party moves of the kind QPR have undertaken, to prevent ‘artificially’ lowered losses. If the League decide QPR’s ‘real’ losses are £69.8m, the FFP fine they potentially face will be £57.9m. QPR declined to comment and remain in talks with the Football League. Whatever is decided, refusal to pay a fine could result in their expulsion to non-League football.","QPR accounts show they could still face a big Financial Fair Play fine .

Burnley have signed Norwegian midfielder Fredrik Ulvestad on a three-year deal . Clarets boss Sea Dyche was in need of extra bodies in midfield ahead of the Premier League run-in . Burnley have been in need of midfield reinforcements since Dean Marney suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury against West Brom at the start of February. The 22-year-old Ulvestad has been without a club since his contract with Aalesunds expired at the end of the last Norwegian season. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says new signing Fredrik Ulvestad won't be rushed into first-team action. 'It's a new challenge for him now, not only on the pitch but off it too in terms of culture,' Dyche said. 'There will be an adjustment period, for sure, because of the change in the levels of football. We know how tough the Premier League is, so he will be given time to adjust to that accordingly and continue his development. 'Fredrik is someone who came into the club to spend some time with us earlier this year. 'We liked what we saw and he has gained some good experience playing in the league in Norway.

"Southampton will push their finances to the limit to keep Morgan Schneiderlin this summer. Arsenal are confident of landing the France midfielder but the Saints are desperate to keep him and will offer him a bumper contract. Schneiderlin’s £30,000-a-week deal still has two-and-a-half years to run but Southampton are prepared to double his money, making him the club’s top earner. Southampton are determined to do all they can to keep midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin at St Mary's . Despite having his differences with the Saints last summer the France international has impressed this term . However, Arsenal are increasing their interest in the Frenchman and are prepared to make an offer . His stock has risen this season after a string of excellent displays for Ronald Koeman’s side. Schneiderlin, 25, was furious last summer after the club refused to sanction a move to Tottenham during the final weeks of the transfer window. But his subsequent attitude impressed the club, who want to reward him for his work this season. However, with the Gunners in the background, Schneiderlin is by no means guaranteed to sign a new deal. In that case the Saints will slap a high price on him in an attempt to put off potential suitors. Upwards of £25million has been discussed by the Saints hierarchy if they are forced to part with the Frenchman at the end of the season. The Gunners will have to fork out a reported £25million for the Saints star at the end of the season .","Southampton are prepared to offer Morgan Schneiderlin a bumper deal .

"While manager Tony Pulis wound down after a crushing FA Cup quarter-final defeat to soft soul on his favourite radio station, his West Brom team flushed the defeat out of their system with a trip to the go-karting track. Very different approaches but both seemed to have the desired effect of melting away the disappointment. A narrow victory over Stoke may have lacked petrol fuelled highs or many thrills of any description, but it lifted West Brom to 13th in the table, consigning two defeats to local rivals Villa within a week to distant memory. Tony Pulis' West Brom squad went on a go-karting trip after their FA Cup quarter-final defeat . Darren Fletcher (right) said the midweek  trip was kept under wraps for fear of sending out the wrong message . 'I let them have a couple of days away from me,' said Pulis about the aftermath of a 2-0 defeat which ended in a pitch invasion and FA probe into seats being thrown by West Brom supporters, 'I was obviously bitterly disappointed myself and I can be a bit snappy at times. So I took myself away from the firing line. 'You either have a passion or you don't and sometimes I get myself in such a state I am best away from people.' Despite Saturday's win — thanks to Brown Ideye's headed goal — taking West Brom 11 points clear of the relegation zone Pulis said his aims were unchanged. 'I still want 40 points,' he said. 'I'm not concerned about what others do, I would be in my grave by now if I sat worrying about every goal that goes in. I listen to Smooth Radio and a bit of music rather than worry about what other people are doing.' West Brom beat Stoke City at the Hawthorns on Saturday thanks to Brown Ideye's headed goal . Darren Fletcher said the midweek go-karting trip was kept under wraps for fear of sending out the wrong message to fans. 'We didn't want to show the world we doing it and we didn't want the fans to see us trying to do stuff like that straight after losing to Villa. We gave ourselves a little lift, it was just for us as the lads. They were down, it was hard to lose two games to Villa, especially the Cup game. I think it worked quite well so maybe we'll go karting again next week.' Fletcher, 31, is enjoying a resurgence at The Hawthorns after joining on a free transfer in January from Manchester United, where his later years were blighted by a struggle with ulcerative colitis. He bossed the midfield against Stoke but claimed he rolled over on the racing track. 'In the interests of team spirit, I let the rest of the lads win,' he joked, 'The top three were Gardner, [Joleon] Lescott and [Saido] Berahino, they were saying the Brummie lads did the business. Gards organised it and he definitely had the fastest car.'","West Brom had a midweek go-karting session after Aston Villa dumped them out of the FA Cup .

"Ligue 1 top scorer Alexandre Lacazette will not be heading for the Barclays Premier League next season, if Olympique Lyonnais president Jean-Michel Aulas is to be believed.

Alexandre Lacazette has 21 goals this season and his club Lyon are reluctant to see their top hit man leave . The 23-year-old admitted that he could move on in the summer but Lyon's president has refuted that . Lacazette has been linked Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool but amid speculation of a summer departure, Aulas has confirmed he will be keeping hold of the striker. The 23-year-old told Lyon's TV channel on Thursday: 'I know that several clubs are watching me, but I will think about whether I want to leave or stay later on and then we shall see. 'At the moment I cannot say if I am staying or not, because if a club puts a certain amount of millions of euros on the table, the president will probably tell me to leave.'

"There may still be 10 games and more than two months to go until the curtain falls on this season's Barclays Premier League action. But, somewhat farcically, voting  for the Players' Player of the Year award, has already begun. Luis Suarez, who scored 31 league goals for Liverpool last term before his £75million summer move to Barcelona, currently holds the title. Sportsmail's team of top writers give their verdict on which player they would want to follow in the Uruguay international's footsteps if they were asked to cast their vote today. IAN LADYMAN . Nemanja Matic . Jose Mourinho’s current Chelsea team is perhaps the most physically imposing he has ever assembled and Matic stands out as a giant among men. A superb reader of the game, Matic can pass the ball well, too. He would get in just about every team in Europe and that says it all. Nemanja Matic, in action for Chelsea against PSG earlier this week, has starred for the Blues this season . MATT BARLOW . Harry Kane . Chelsea have been the best team with immense consistency from Nemanja Matic and Eden Hazard. But no-one has made a greater individual impact than Harry Kane. He’s transformed the mood at White Hart Lane with his energy and desire, deflected attention from the big-money flops and offered hope for the future as a flag-bearer for the youth system. Not to mention 26 goals, and an anticipated England call-up. He must finish the season and kick on, but Kane seems capable of that. Each time he seems about to fade, he hits back. Harry Kane celebrates with his second successive Barclays Player of the Month award on Friday . Kane, pictured celebrating against Queens Park Rangers, has scored 26 times for Tottenham this season . LEE CLAYTON . Who deserves to be voted Player of the Year today? Here’s my answer to the question: No-one. It’s too early. It’s a nonsense that the players have to vote so soon and shows why the Footballer of the Year award, voted by members of the Football Writers’ Association, has more credibility. I'll save my vote until then, thank you. But among the contenders: John Terry, Harry Kane, Philippe Coutinho, Alexis Sanchez, Diego Costa, Eden Hazard, Danny Ings, David de Gea and Charlie Austin. Voting now is like deciding a Wimbledon champion before the quarter-finals are played. I want to see how they fare at the business end of the season. Alexis Sanchez has impressed for Arsenal following his summer switch from Barcelona . MIKE KEEGAN . Eden Hazard . It's close between Hazard and Sergio Aguero but the brilliant Belgian shades it thanks to his remarkable injury-free record. Already this season Hazard has pulled on a Chelsea shirt 41 times and has again been superb. Aguero's susceptibility to various issues stops him from becoming Manchester City's first winner of the award. Eden Hazard has played 41 matches for Chelsea this season but has been one of the league's best players . NEIL ASHTON . Harry Kane . He deserves it for the surprise element more than anything else - nobody could have predicted his impact at Tottenham this season. He lives for the game, thriving on the responsibility of scoring goals for the club and enjoying his relationship with Spurs supporters. Next week he will be rewarded with a call into the England squad. ROB DRAPER . Nemanja Matic . I reserve the right to change my mind in the next few weeks, as Eden Hazard and Alexis Sanchez have both been superb. Hazard could become one of the game’s greats. But I’m close to settling on Matic, because his position is often under-acknowledged and because he has provided balance to a Chelsea team that had collected flair players while eschewing midfielders who can defend. He is a throwback to Patrick Vieira: the aggression, the superb distribution, the instinctive reading of the game and, most of all, those longs legs extending to whip the ball away from an attacking player who thinks he is clear on goal. Because he is so good defensively, his passing and creativity in forward areas are often overlooked. I’m expecting the more glamorous players to win the awards but I don’t think any player contributes more to their respective teams than Matic. Matic parades the Capital One Cup trophy with Branislav Ivanovic after their triumph over Tottenham . Sanchez and Hazard have both been impressive performers for their sides this season . CRAIG HOPE . Harry Kane . There is nothing dark about the art of Kane and a victory for the Spurs striker would be a victory for football and all of the reasons why we should love the game. There are no elbows, no spitting, no intimidating referees - he scores goals for his boyhood club and does so with a smile on his face. His brilliant enthusiasm aside, Kane is a worthy winner on footballing merit alone and has consistently been the division's best striker this season. His goals have invariably been match-winning and his breakthrough campaign should be crowned with a clean sweep of the annual awards. David De Gea has spared Manchester United's blushes on a number of occasions this season . Branislav Ivanovic would win Joe Bernstein's vote . MARTHA KELNER . David De Gea . He almost certainly won't win it but David De Gea deserves some representation for Player of the Year based purely on the fact he has single-handedly and often stunningly rescued Manchester United and kept them in the hunt for a top-four finish. JOE BERNSTEIN . Branislav Ivanvoic . This is one of the toughest to call because the obvious stand-out performers -  Diego Costa, Eden Hazard and Sergio Aguero - have missed games or been inconsistent. So in a very even field I'd vote for Branislav Ivanovic because he's typified best why Chelsea will be champions . CHRIS WHEELER . Eden Hazard . Chelsea aren’t winning too many friends at the moment but it does look like they will win a Premier League and Capital One Cup double, and no-one will have contributed more than last season’s PFA Young Player of the Year. A supremely gifted footballer, Hazard deserves the main award this season ahead of Sanchez, Costa, Coutinho and Kane. LAURIE WHITWELL . David De Gea . Nobody goes to football matches hoping for clean sheets but the United goalkeeper has produced saves of wonder this season, genuinely entertaining and worthy of repeated replays as much as any goal. This award should go to a player who has impacted his team significantly, clearly lifting them higher. So far, De Gea has done that.","Voting for the Players' Player of the Year award has already begun .

"It was the final minute of a one-sided game and Everton winger Christian Atsu set off on one last attack. Sprinting in front of him was Ross Barkley and Atsu wasted no time sending the England man clear. As Tim Krul raced out, Barkley danced around him, the ball never leaving his feet and - with the goal at his mercy - he gracefully applied the finishing touch. Goodison Park, at long last, was exultant and all around this old stadium, fans punched the air in celebration. On the touchline, Roberto Martinez was a little more reserved but there is no doubt a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. This was a big day for the manager and his team, but they came through it with panache. In the end they beat Newcastle 3-0 but that score might have been six. Click here to read Dominic King's full match report . Host commentator . Everton move six points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with what turned out to be a comfortable win for the home side in the end. The Toffees took the lead through James McCarthy before Romelu Lukaku added a second from the penalty spot. Everton's day was made easier when Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini was sent off for a dangerous lunging tackle on Aaron Lennon before Ross Barkley added a third in the closing stages of the match. Substitute Ross Barkley shows Kone how it is done by rounding Krul before placing the ball into an empty net. Kone rounds Krul after dodging several challenges from Newcastle's defenders but he runs out of space to score. He probably should have squared the ball to a team-mate but his goalscoring instinct saw him try to score a goal of his own. Atsu comes on for the final five minutes of this afternoon's match at Goodison Park. Sissoko, who is captaining Newcastle following Coloccini's sending off, made Howard make his first real save of the afternoon with a powerful shot at goal. Howard made a good save to his left before shouting at his defenders. Osman, who has been in impressive form, just tested Krul with an effort but the Dutchman was able to palm the ball to safety. The Toffees are not exactly pushing for a third goal but I suppose they are content with their two-goal advantage. Newcastle, on the other hand, are starting to tire due to their numerical disadvantage. Gutierrez replaces Riviere as 10-man Newcastle attempt to close up shop. They know they are out of the game now so it's just a case of keeping the scoreline down to as low as possible. Newcastle's day has been made even worse as their captain has been sent off for a disgusting challenge - if you can call it that - on Lennon. He was incredibly late and his studs were raised as he made a lazy attempt to win back possession for his side. Carver throws on Cabella for Ameobi immediately after Everton's second. Lukaku adds a crucial second goal by converting the penalty from 12 yards. He slots the ball past Krul before running away in celebration. Gouffran is penalised for a clumsy tackle on Aaron Lennon. Kone is being given the time and space to dictate play in the middle of the park but his final pass leaves a lot to be desired. Ayoze Perez came on at half-time in place of Obertan. A positive move by John Carver, who will feel his side can get something out of today's game. Just to recap, here's how McCarthy scored his first goal of the season for Everton. That strike could be pivotal in terms of the Toffees' hopes of staying in the Premier League. A nervous Everton side go into the interval with a 1-0 lead. McCarthy's goal was somewhat fortunate as Krul should have done a lot better but the Toffees will take any kind of fortune given this position in the league. The home crowd are starting to vent their frustrations at Everton despite still being in the lead. Toffees fans will be desperate for their side to open up a two-goal lead in order to ensure they take all three points. The Toffees have grown in confidence since taking the lead through McCarthy. Kone appears to be enjoying a free role just behind Lukaku, while the Belgium international is holding the ball up well. Baines is starting to have some joy down the left. Janmaat is struggling to deal with Baines' runs from deeps. The England left back could have some joy today. Nice moment at Goodison Park. Jonas Gutierrez has just started warming up, running alongside the Family Enclosure towards the Gwladys Street end, both of which are the domain of home supporters. As he made his way to the corner flag on his short shuttle sprint, there was spontaneous applause from Evertonians, a mark of respect for what he has been through. Everton are starting to get a real grip on this game. Ryan Taylor received a yellow card for bringing down the marauding Lennon. Good atmosphere inside Goodison Park, none of the tension that made the first 30 minutes of the Europa League contest with Dynamo Kiev so uncomfortable. Everton have had the better of the play so far and look fresher, thanks to Roberto Martinez making five changes from that 2-1 win on Thursday. It’s a big game for Everton and they look primed to get the result they need particularly now that James McCarthy has given them the lead. Lukaku holds the ball up before laying it on to McCarthy who scores his first goal of the season with a driven shot at goal. Krul committed himself to diving to his right, however McCarthy sent the ball in the opposite corner. Both sides have failed to really trouble the opposing goalkeeper in the first 17 minutes of the match. Newcastle are just shading the possession stats. Martinez will also need help from his goalkeeper Tim Howard, who has not been in the best of form this season. The former Manchester United man will surely take confidence in his early save. Everton's last home win in the Premier League came back in December when Martinez's side beat QPR 3-1. The Toffees will surely have to improve their home form if they cant to climb the table and ensure they are not involved in a relegation scrap. Lukaku, who found the back of the net against Dynamo Kiev on Thursday, stings Krul's gloves with a powerful shot at goal. He will be desperate to live up to his price-tag and help Everton pull away from the relegation zone. Newcastle have started the match extremely brightly. Obertan tested Howard with a powerful effort before Williamson's shot was cleared off the line. Everton: Howard; Baines, Jagielka, Alcaraz, Coleman; McCarthy, Gibson, Lennon, Osman; Kone, Lukaku . Newcastle: Krul; Janmaat, Coloccini, Williamson, R.Taylor; Colback, Sissoko; Obertan, Gouffran, Ameobi; Riviere . The attention switches from the top half of the table to the bottom half where Everton are in desperate need of a win. Roberto Martinez's side are currently just three points away from the Barcalys Premier League drop zone. Newcastle, on the other hand, are sitting comfortably in mid-table. Everton will look to pull clear of the relegation zone in the Premier League with three points against mid-table Newcastle at Goodison Park. Roberto Martinez's side have struggled this season - a surprise given their impressive fifth-placed finish last year - and are currently only three points away from the bottom three. Newcastle, on the other hand, have been secure in mid-table for the majority of this season. They have dropped away from the clubs towards the top of the league, but still find themselves 10 points away from the relegation zone. Three points against Everton would almost certainly secure their Premier League status for another season.","James McCarthy scored past Tim Krul in the 20th minute .

"Nottingham Forest are keen to turn Gary Gardner's loan move from Aston Villa into a permanent one. The England Under 21 international scored a spectacular goal for Forest on Saturday to cap their 3-0 win over Reading and has impressed during his time at the City Ground. Gardner has been a key figure in Dougie Freedman's revival which has seen Forest win five and draw one of their last six games, scoring 19 goals in the process and climbing to ninth in the table, ten points off the play-off positions. Nottingham Forest . The 22-year-old Gardner has enjoyed the change. He said: 'The manager has been very firm, he has been very organised and every one of us knows our job. There have been no excuses. 'If one player does not do their job, the whole team can fall down. The gaffer is not scared to pick you out in the dressing room if you do not do your job and, as a player, you do not like to be picked out. That is a major part. If you are not pulling your weight, you will not play. Everyone on the pitch wants to stay on the pitch.' Gardner, who has been capped by England from U17 level through to U21, was touted as one of the game's best prospects but a couple of cruciate ligament injuries derailed his progress. Gardner scored in Nottingham Forest's 3-0 win over Reading on Saturday with a spectacular strike . However, after a loan spell at Brighton and his stint at Forest, he has started to gain match sharpness and is beginning to fulfil his potential. Freedman has been delighted with Gardner's performances and wants him to be part of his ambitious project to take Forest into the Premier League. That will not be straight forward though as Villa manager Tim Sherwood rates Gardner also. Sherwood is fully focused on Villa's relegation battle but has been kept informed of the young midfielder's performances as he continues to weigh up the players at his disposal. Sherwood put great faith in youth during his time at Tottenham and Villa's highly-rated production line was a big pull for him when he pitched to replace Paul Lambert. Gardner is one of the players he is keen to work with and Sherwood won't contemplate any sale. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood rates Gardner highly and is keen to keep the midfielder next season .","Gary Gardner scored in Nottingham Forest's 3-0 win over Reading .

"Louis van Gaal's first season with Manchester United is in danger of turning into a complete mess following the FA Cup defeat by Arsenal. The Dutchman has enjoyed a stellar career but there are signs that he has yet to grasp the demands of the Barclays Premier League and his decisions have left United facing a huge fight to salvage some respectability. Here Sportsmail looks at some of the mistakes that Van Gaal has made. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal (left) and assistant Ryan Giggs during their  defeat by Arsenal . Why sell Welbeck? There was an inevitability the England striker would return to haunt Van Gaal. United's manager may have been happy to sanction that deal to Arsenal last summer but, in many ways, it was a mistake and shows the shifting values of United. Why did they allow a young English player whose best days are ahead of him to leave and replace him with someone on an extreme salary who was recovering from injury? United as a club develop players. Van Gaal prides himself on working with young talent, so keeping Welbeck should have made sense. The 'Galactico' policy they are pushing doesn't suit them. It caused shock against Arsenal that Falcao was overlooked when United were losing but has the Colombian really done anything to justify being at Old Trafford? Van Gaal's mistake was letting Welbeck leave and bringing in a player who wasn't guaranteed to suit English football. Danny Welbeck shoots to score the winning goal against Manchester United on Monday night at Old Trafford . A stranded David de Gea looks on as the goalkeeper was beaten by former United player Welbeck . Welbeck celebrated his goal against his former club  as Arsenal won the FA Cup tie 2-1 . Messing up in Milton Keynes . So much has happened during this season you could almost forget about the events of Tuesday, August 26. However, Van Gaal made an error that night by selecting a weak team to take on MK Dons in the Capital One Cup. With no European commitments, Van Gaal should have gone full strength to give United a chance of competing for silverware. Instead, he selected six players who are no longer at the club and that 4-0 capitulation increased scrutiny at an early stage. No coach should throw away an opportunity to win a competition but that is what United did against League One opponents. Tumbling out of the FA Cup means this will be the first time since 1989 that United have gone two years without a trophy. United lost 4-0 against MK Dons earlier in the season as Van Gaal played a weak team . MK Dons  striker Benik Afobe celebrates scoring their third goal against United at Stadium MK . No coach should throw away an opportunity to win a competition but Van Gaal did against MK Dons . Not playing to Wayne Rooney's strengths . As Roy Keane observed after the Arsenal defeat, Rooney is 'as good as anyone' when he is deployed in a central striking role. To prove that, he has scored three goals in his last three games and is the one United outfield player who you would genuinely call world-class. But Van Gaal has muddied the picture by playing him deep at times and not utilising his talents. That has had a detrimental effect on results. Rooney, remember, had a spell not long ago when he went nine matches without scoring. Giggs speaks with United captain Wayne Rooney, who has been played out of position previously . Van Gaal has muddied the picture by playing Rooney deep at times and not utilising his talents . What has happened to that style? Keane made another pertinent observation when he said it is 'time to stop looking back at what United had before'. They will not progress as a club if they keep harking back to the good old days of Sir Alex Ferguson. What United have lost, though, is the identity of how they play. At their best, you associate United teams as being fast, dynamic and fearless, always prepared to take risks and stay on the front foot. Has Van Gaal presided over a performance this season that has been universally lauded for attractive football? No. It says everything about them that against Arsenal they finished off hoisting long-balls to Marouane Fellaini and Chris Smalling. United have lacked a good style since Van Gaal took charge during the summer after the World Cup . Firing it up to Fellaini . Fellaini is a good player and he has made a contribution for Van Gaal this season but his continued presence in the team is now proving a hindrance. Liverpool had the issue when Andy Carroll played for them in that it became too easy to smash a ball up to the big presence at the top of the field and United are falling in to that trap. Van Gaal is a coach whose teams historically play attractive football but Fellaini is making United a more primitive outfit. Marouane Fellaini (right) more often than not is told to try to win long balls with his presence up front . How do you solve a problem like (Di) Maria? Picture Angel di Maria in your mind and what do you see? It will probably be of a flying winger hurtling down a flank, the ball stuck to his foot like glue and a defender spinning and swerving to try and cut out the danger. Go back to last season's Champions League final and you will see countless examples. How many times have you see Di Maria do that in a Red shirt? Van Gaal talks of philosophies and systems but doesn't it just make sense to play players in their best positions? Di Maria looked majestic early on in his United career. Lately he looks to be confused by what Van Gaal wants. Angel di Maria is shown a red card during United's defeat at Old Trafford against Arsenal on Monday . Di Maria leaves the field after being sent off during the defeat that was Van Gaal's last chance of a trophy . Changing the formation . Football should, essentially, be a simple game but Van Gaal's tactics can be confusing and nothing shows that up more than whether he is playing three defenders or four. United pass the ball around at the back without really having a purpose and they now have a habit of getting themselves into a panic, as shown by the mistakes that led to Welbeck's goal. It says everything that United's fans sang '4-4-2!' when they played Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Van Gaal's ego meant he was always going to be single-minded in his approach to this job but maybe he has underestimated how true United fans are to traditions. Ripping up a blueprint that had been successful for a quarter of a century has not had the desired effect. United are now too cautious and have lost their speed and threat. It also means they are losing their formidable reputation, too.","Manchester United lost 2-1 against Arsenal in the FA Cup on Monday .

"The financial rewards of Southampton’s continued academy excellence were blindingly obvious last summer, but Lille run the south coast club close in terms of money generated from their youth products. A study carried out by the CIES Football Observatory shows Lille have benefited hugely from the Premier League’s wealth over the last three years - with the country producing players worth more than any other on the continent. Only Southampton have been paid higher transfer fees for players brought through their youth system than the Ligue 1 side in that time throughout the whole of Europe. Southampton have taken more money for their youth stars than any other side in Europe since 2012 . Eden Hazard's move from Lille to Chelsea helped the French side rake in profits from their academy . Divock Origi (right) joined Liverpool in the summer but was immediately loaned back to France . MONEY EARNED FROM SELLING HOMEGROWN PLAYERS SINCE 2012 . Mathieu Debuchy left Lille for Newcastle United before later sealing a switch to Arsenal . Calum Chambers, Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw made 90.2million euros (£64.4m) for Saints as they moved to Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United respectively at the end of last season. But interestingly it is Lille – midtable in France’s top division - who were the most profitable of the rest. And that’s thanks in no small part to the Premier League. Eden Hazard (Chelsea), Mathieu Debuchy (Newcastle) and Divock Origi (Liverpool) have all sealed permanent switches to England since 2012 and count for the majority of Lille’s 76million euros recouped. While they have been able to lean on Origi this year – the Belgian striker was immediately sent back on loan – they are renowned for taking the money for their sellable assets. They sold five academy stars in that period in contrast to Real Sociedad’s two – Antoine Griezmann and Asier Illarramendi. Atletico Madrid snapped up the former for around 30m euros last summer, with city rivals Real taking Illarramendi a year previous. It is Ligue 1 who garner the most profit on their academy stars, with the Premier League third . Adam Lallana (left) and Luke Shaw both left St Mary's for bigger things last summer . Unsurprisingly Real Madrid and Barcelona both figure in the top 10 after selling off a raft of players who were unlikely to impact on their first team for modest profits. Mario Gotze’s move to Bayer Munich mean Dortmund figure ahead of the Spanish giants, with Sevilla nestled beneath Sociedad after earning just over 50m euros. The research puts into perspective a lack of homegrown talent emerging from top-flight clubs outside of Southampton’s buzzing academy. Swansea, Manchester United and Everton are the only other domestic sides included in Europe’s top 20; each of United’s five players sold – Michael Keane, Danny Welbeck, Robbie Brady, Matt James and Josh King – were deemed surplus to requirements at Old Trafford, with four of them having to drop down a division in the search of regular football. A large proportion of Everton’s profits was down to Jack Rodwell’s move to Manchester City, and it is unquestionably Saints who continue to lead the way in nurturing talent.","Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Calum Chambers all left Southampton last summer for big money .

"Monisha Kaltenborn has no intention of quitting as team principal of Sauber despite being mired in legal controversy this week. Kaltenborn's position has been drawn into sharp focus after appearing to have signed three drivers for the new Formula One season, but with naturally only two seats available. The case with reserve driver Giedo van der Garde is to continue at the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne on Saturday, just a few miles from the Albert Park circuit. Monisha Kaltenborn addresses the media in Melbourne on Friday with her team mired in controversy . Felipe Nasr takes to the Albert Park track during the second practice session for the Australian Grand Prix . Kaltenborn, a trained lawyer, was naturally unable to shed any light on the case given it remains ongoing. But asked whether she was still competent to run the team, Kaltenborn replied: 'I don't see it (the case) having any effect. 'We have a very clear view of what we did. We took action after thinking about it for a while. 'For us that was very clear, but the outcome is different, and that's all I can say to you.' Pressed on whether she had considered resigning, Kaltenborn added: 'I've not considered that. Giedo van der Garde walks through the Sauber team garage as his legal dispute with the team continues . Lewis Hamilton in action for Mercedes as the champions continued where they left off by setting the pace . 'This whole matter does not have any effect on the way we work, the way the team works.' Kaltenborn conceded, however, the past week had affected morale with the team's name dragged through the courts. 'It's had a very negative impact on the team because the situation was, for a while, unclear,' added Kaltenborn. 'We now have certain actions taken against the team, and we are acting accordingly. There's nothing much more really I can say to that.' The Supreme Court initially upheld a Swiss arbitration panel decision that the team not deny Van der Garde his right to drive given the 29-year-old has a contract for a full-time seat for this season. Swedish driver Marcus Ericsson was also in action for Sauber under the blazing sun in Melbourne . Van der Garde is now pursuing enforcement of the order allowing him to drive, otherwise Sauber risk being in contempt of court. At one stage during the day bailiffs were on stand-by outside the circuit ready to impound Sauber's assets, namely the cars and trackside equipment. Sauber's problem is they also signed Marcus Ericcson and Felipe Nasr towards the end of last year before cancelling Van der Garde's deal in February, according to Kaltenborn. With three valid contracts and only two race seats available, Sauber and Kaltenborn have found themselves mired in controversy . Sauber have been forced to detail their assets to the court, whilst the worst-case scenario for Kaltenborn is she faces imprisonment if she fails to comply with the order. The legal argument resulted in Sauber failing to take to the track for the opening practice session of the year at Melbourne's Albert Park. Come FP2, with lawyers for both parties back in court at the same time, it was Ericsson and Nasr behind the wheel, with Van der Garde unable to acquire in time a super licence required to drive in F1. Asked as to why they were unable to take part in FP1 yet did so in FP2, she replied: 'It's a topic which I cannot talk about. That's all I can say.' In court, Justice Croft ordered a further recess until 9.30am local time Saturday (10.30pm UK), with constructive talks understood to have taken place, leading to the possibility of a conclusion.","Monisha Kaltenborn has no plan to resign with team mired in controversy .

"Real Madrid's 4-3 loss to Schalke  has prompted further calls for change in the Spanish capital. They progressed to the quarter-finals of the Champions League thanks to a 2-0 win in the first leg, but Tuesday night was supposed to be easy. On Sunday, their place at the top of La Liga was swiped from underneath them, and 92% of fans have demanded a change in tactical approach, according to a recent poll in AS. Most players have been criticised - Cristiano Ronaldo included - but perhaps most under-fire is Iker Casillas. Mr Real Madrid, with over 500 appearances. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas has come under heavy scrutiny after a series of poor performances . Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea has been touted as the perfect replacement at Real Madrid . Three of Schalke's four goals could have been saved, they said. Casillas needs to leave, they said. At 33 years of age, he may well be past his best, with three European Cups, five league titles and one World Cup tucked safely under his belt. Manchester United's David De Gea has been touted as his possible replacement, and even Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher waded into the debate on Tuesday night. 'Madrid need a new keeper. De Gea wants to win trophies. No brainer,' he wrote on Twitter. De Gea was labelled the best goalkeeper in the world by Roy Keane this week, and may leave United . Keylor Navas is also waiting for his chance at the Bernabeu after joining in the summer . And perhaps he has a point. Manchester United have fallen short of expectations once more, and De Gea will be keen to taste success... where better than the city he was born? He is a Spain international, and certainly talented enough to take the reins from his countryman. But you get the feeling that Real Madrid would not be the same without Casillas. Since 1999, he has been a main-stay at the Bernabeu. At the end of the game on Tuesday night, there was an endearing moment in which he refused to let his team-mates leave the pitch before thanking the Madrid fans. Casillas would not let his team-mates leave the pitch on Tuesday night before they thanked the supporters . Cristiano Ronaldo was unhappy at his side's performance, but was made to applaud the fans by Casillas . Pointing and pulling, ushering his team-mates to the corners of the pitch to applaud the supporters. But still they want rid. For the first goal, he palmed the ball into his bottom corner. For the second, he pushed it into the path of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. For the third, he was rooted to the spot. Success is in Madrid's nature, and their fans aren't happy with the amount of goals they are conceding. That starts at the back... with Casillas. Aside from De Gea's potential arrival, you can't forget the presence of Keylor Navas. Signed from Levante in the summer, he is waiting, willing, wishing for his chance. De Gea is a Spain international and grew up in Madrid, playing for Atletico before moving to Man United . Casillas has had a remarkable career, winning numerous trophies including the 2010 World Cup . But De Gea makes sense. He is 24 years old, and getting better with every game he plays. Signed by Sir Alex Ferguson for just shy of £19million in 2011, United would make a tidy profit on him if he were to leave. 'I think David De Gea is the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment,' Roy Keane told ITV after Monday night's FA Cup clash with Arsenal. The best goalkeeper in the world to one of the best football clubs in the world. Maybe Jamie Carragher has called it right again.","Real Madrid lost 4-3 to Schalke in the Champions League on Tuesday .

"It's the run of games which will go a long way to deciding whether Manchester United are playing Champions League or Europa League football next season. Four of the Premier League's top six - Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea - in their next fives games. Make-or-break for Louis van Gaal and his players. Other than the home clash with relegation-threatened Aston Villa on April 4, Sunday's visit of Spurs would appear to be United's best hope of three points over the next month and a half. But recent results tell a different story. Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney (L-R) look dejected during defeat by Arsenal .

Having won 17 and drawn five of their previous 22 games against Tottenham, United now find themselves without a win in their last five matches with the north London outfit. Mauricio Pochettino's men battled to a 0-0 at White Hart Lane in December but Spurs have won their previous two visits to Old Trafford, ending a 23-year wait for victory with a 3-2 triumph in September 2012. United had gone 26 games without defeat at home to Spurs in all competitions - winning their previous nine - before a Jonny Evans own goal and strikes from Gareth Bale and Clint Dempsey gave Andre Villas-Boas' men a memorable win in Manchester. And Tottenham proved that result was no fluke last season when goals from Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen sealed a 2-1 victory for Tim Sherwood's side. Gareth Bale scores during Tottenham's 3-2 victory at Old Trafford in September 2012 - their first in 23 years . Clint Dempsey celebrates after netting Spurs' winner against Sir Alex Ferguson's side . Then Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas shows his delight after the final whistle . Two draws at White Hart Lane - 1-1 in January 2013 and 2-2 in December 2013 - were sandwiched between those victories, taking Spurs' unbeaten run to an impressive five games. So impressive, in fact, that they are only the third team to manage such a run against United. Liverpool did the same between 2000 and 2002, winning four consecutive games against their great rivals - including two at Old Trafford - and drawing once. Blackburn Rovers also went five games unbeaten against the Red Devils between 2004 and 2006, winning at Old Trafford in September 2005 and coming out on top in two fixtures at Ewood Park. Just three points behind United going into Sunday's game, Tottenham have a major incentive to pull off their third successive win at Old Trafford and become the first team to go six games unbeaten against United in the Premier League era.

"Lukas Podolski's loan spell at Inter Milan has been far from impressive, and the Arsenal man could find himself back in north London come the summer. The 29-year-old German forward was shipped out to Serie A in January but has failed to net on nine occasions for Roberto Mancini's side, and his agent has revealed that a move back to the Emirates could be on the cards. 'Anything could happen,' Ali Pektas told Fanatik. 'Last summer he could have moved to Galatasaray, but it never materialised. Every summer Lukas and I go on holiday to Turkey. Despite working hard at training, Lukas Podolski has struggled to make an impact on loan at Inter Milan . Podolski strikes the ball during a session at Inter Milan's Appiano Gentile training ground on Wednesday . 'For the moment he's on loan at Inter, and when it ends at the end of the season he could return to Arsenal, where he still has a year on his contract. 'With regard to his future, all I can say is that anything could happen, even a transfer to Turkey. Why not? He appreciates [Turkish football] a lot, and he wants to keep playing at a high level.' Podolski was this week rated as the second-worst Serie A signing of the season in a poll conducted by Gazzetta dello Sport, but he is not fazed by the criticism being levelled at him. The Arsenal loanee falls to the floor under the challenge of Fiorentina defender Gonzalo on Sunday . Podolski battles for a header with Milan Badelj (right) but he has not impressed during his time in Serie A . He told Sport1: You need to swallow [criticism] in professional football. There is always another direction, meaning a positive one. 'I don't care for media or people being critical of me. I know that this is part of the business. It's important to know what you have to do to be better. Podolski was given an opportunity to start Inter's crunch clash with Fiorentina on Sunday, but was hauled off in the second half after another lacklustre performance. A particular low point of the match came when Podolski kicked the flag while taking a corner and miskicked the ball, which failed to reach the penalty area and was intercepted to set up a Fiorentina counter-attack.

"Bordeaux captain Lamine Sane has issued a come-and-get-me plea to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers by revealing he would be keen on sealing a move to Anfield. Sane, who has played 16 Ligue 1 games for Bordeaux so far this season, is capable of playing at centre back and in midfield. The Senegal international has stated he is content with life at Bordeaux but has aspirations to play in England. Bordeaux skipper Lamine Sane has revealed he is keen on joining Premier League outfit Liverpool . Reds boss Brendan Rodgers will be keen on bolstering his options during the summer transfer window . Sane, speaking to beIN Sports, said: 'Honestly, I feel very good at Bordeaux, for the moment. 'It is true that I have always been drawn to England. As for a club: Liverpool. I have always said Liverpool, since my first ever interview. It is a club that I really like.' Sane's ability to play in defence and midfield could entice Rodgers into making a move for the Bordeaux ace as the Liverpool boss will be keen to purchase players who are capable of playing across his new favoured 3-4-3 formation. Rodgers' current defensive options include Dejan Lovren - who has struggled to impress since completing his £20million move to Liverpool - and Kolo Toure - who is out of contract in the summer.

"Arsenal's 18-year-old German-born midfielder Gedion Zelalem will go straight into the USA national team if FIFA grant him eligibility, coach Jurgen Klinsmann told reporters on Thursday. Zelalem was born in Berlin and played for Germany at youth level and was also eligible to play for Ethiopia through his parents. However the player has expressed a desire to play for the United States and gained U.S. citizenship in December, opening the door to a potential switch pending permission from the world governing body. VIDEO Scroll down to see Zelalem score an amazing basket for Thierry Henry . Gedion Zelalem in action for Arsenal against Galatasaray in the Champions League in December 2014 . 'He is a special case. I think he is already at a level that he can definitely play with the senior team,' Klinsmann told reporters. Although Zelalem has yet to feature in a Premier League game for Arsenal he is seen as one of the most exciting prospects in the club's youth ranks. He made his first-team debut in the FA Cup win over Coventry City in January last year and made another appearance from the bench in the Champions League game away to Galatasaray in December 2014. USA head coach Jurgen Klinsmann hopes that FIFA grants Zelalem permission to play for his side . Klinsmann did not rule out the midfielder being given a slot in one of the U.S. youth teams at some stage but said he wanted to see him with the first team initially. 'Definitely I would like to see him with me first. I want to see how he interacts with the whole group and what level he is in. For the next dates, I am totally open to have him in the Under-23s,' he said. Zelalem lived in the United States from 2006 until 2013 when he joined London club Arsenal. Zelalem, playing for the Gunners during his debut last year against Coventry, lived in the USA from 2006-13 . FIFA rules, designed to stop players from being granted citizenship for entirely football reasons, require players to live in a country for five years after their 18th birthday before they are eligible. The U.S. is hopeful of being granted a waiver in the case of Zelalem, given that his move to the country as a schoolboy had nothing to do with soccer. Klinsmann continues to look for other dual-nationals to strengthen his squad, with Mexican team Club America's Phoenix-born defender Ventura Alvarado and Leon goalkeeper William Yarbrough also on his radar.

"Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer has dismissed suggestions that striker Jordan Rhodes could leave. Championship promotion hopefuls Derby County and Norwich are keen to take Rhodes on loan with view to a permanent £8million transfer should they go up. Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday are interested in a similar deal. The 25-year-old Scotland international has scored 13 goals this season but has not been a regular starter and was on the bench for Sunday's 0-0 FA Cup quarter-final draw at Liverpool. Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes will not be leaving Ewood Park to join a Championship rival . Rhodes (centre) was left on the subs' bench for the duration of Blackburn's FA Cup match against Liverpool . 'I don't understand why we'd want to even consider loaning one of our players to rivals,' said Bowyer. 'I think it's come out of possibly that he wasn't involved in the starting 11 on Sunday. 'We've had plenty of chats, of course we have,' added Bowyer. 'But he's starting on Wednesday against Bolton and we're looking forward to him scoring like he did last week at Sheffield Wednesday. 'It's simple. We've got 11 league games left and a Cup quarter-final with a potential visit to Wembley. 'Why we would want to be letting any of our players go at this stage is beyond me.' Blackburn, who are 14 points off sixth place, rejected a £12m proposal from Hull City last year but posted debts of £79.8m and are under a transfer embargo for failing to comply with FFP rules.

"Jenson Button fears McLaren will qualify at the very back of the grid for Sunday’s Australian Grand Prix. The British driver and his team-mate Kevin Magnussen, who is deputising for the injured Fernando Alonso, endured a miserable day during practice for the season opener at the Albert Park Circuit. The McLaren pair, hampered by reliability problems to their new Honda engine, managed only 13 laps between them in Friday’s opening session and were five seconds down on Nico Rosberg’s best time for Mercedes. Jenson Button cut a frustrated figure in Melbourne on Friday as McLaren struggled for pace and reliability . Button was almost four seconds slower than Nico Rosberg, who set the pace for Mercedes on Friday . And while Button managed to get more running under his belt during the second session, completing 21 laps, he was still almost four seconds down on the front-running Mercedes. Magnussen posted four laps before losing control of his McLaren at Turn Six and crashing into the barriers. Backmarkers Manor, who didn’t compete at any of the winter tests, failed to take to the track on Friday, and Button fears a similar no-show tomorrow will see McLaren bring up the rear for Sunday’s curtain raiser in Melbourne. Kevin Magnussen loses control of his McLaren at Turn Six and runs into the gravel before crashing out . The Dane didn't take any further part in the session with his car in bits before it was taken back to the garage . ‘I am hoping it won’t be the last row of the grid,’ said Button, a three-time winner in Melbourne, when asked about his hopes for qualifying. ‘Hopefully 20 cars will run. It won’t be easy and we all know it. We are working as one and we are not pointing any fingers. We are just solving the problems as we go. Hopefully we will be competitive sooner rather than later.’ McLaren, powered by Honda for the first time since 1992, had a pre-season to forget as they struggled for pace and reliability. And getting to the chequerd flag on Sunday will now be considered a positive result for a team which hasn’t tasted victory in over two years. ‘I have no goals in terms of position,’ said Button. ‘The important thing is to make sure we maximise everything we have and then look at timesheets in qualifying and the race, see how we fared, and how much work we have to do.’ McLaren are powered by Honda this year, but face an uphill struggle and may bring up the rear in Melbourne .","Jenson Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen were well off the pace .

"Wales boss Warren Gatland has warned his players not to get ‘caught with their pants down’ in Rome after their famous victory over Ireland set up a final-round decider against Italy. Having edged out their round-four tie at the Millennium Stadium, Gatland’s side are still in the hunt for the championship but they must better the points difference of both England and Ireland to top the standings. Wales have won their last seven meetings against the Azzuri, however they will have to prepare for the tie at the Stadio Olimpico with major fitness concerns over Jamie Roberts, Richard Hibbard, Gethin Jenkins and Samson Lee. Wales coach Warren Gatland has warned his team to focus on winning against Italy before running up a score . A delighted Wales team celebrates keeping their 2015 RBS Six Nations title hopes alive with victory . ‘If you go in with an attitude that we need to score, 20, 30 or 40 points then we’ll get caught with our pants down and be rolled over,’ said Gatland. ‘It will be tough for Italy with a six-day turnaround. Italy are not a bad side. It’s important to do a job up front and accumulate points. ‘It could come down to the last 15 or 20 minutes. It will be nice to go there and get a win and hopefully win by a few. We’re first up at the weekend so we’ll see how the other teams react afterwards. It puts us under some pressure but hopefully it puts England and Ireland under some pressure too.’ England face a potential banana-skin tie against France, while Ireland have a trip to wooden spoon favourites Scotland. Like Gatland, Ireland coach Joe Schmidt will also approach the closing weekend with caution. The Kiwi coach found himself in a similar situation 12 months ago, when he pipped the English to the title with a dramatic victory at the Stade de France. Sam Warburton gives a thumb up after an heroic defensive effort from Wales in their win over Ireland . Warburton makes a run at Ireland hooker Rory Best at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday . ‘I suppose it’s a bit similar to last year, when we just knew we needed the result in Paris,’ said Schmidt. ‘That’s something we managed to do and we won the championship on the back of it, and England had to sit and watch. But you’ve got to beat those teams first. I don’t think you can afford to go anywhere and start chasing points . . . Scotland are going to be very difficult to beat.’ Last night’s defeat in Cardiff was not how Paul O’Connell hoped to celebrate his 100th Test. The 35-year-old was outfoxed at the line-out by Alun-Wyn Jones and Luke Charteris, admitting that he is itching to right those wrongs at Murrayfield next week. ‘The guys are very disappointed but it’s not up to Joe or me or anyone to lift anyone, it’s up to individuals to lift themselves,’ said O’Connell. ‘One thing about losing is that you just want to get out there and play again as soon as you can.’ Gatland praised his medical team for introducing a ‘spotter’ who flagged up Hibbard’s head injury. Richard Hibbard was withdrawn after his head injury was spotted by video analysis and doctors alerted . Following the controversy of George North’s concussion against England, chief medical manager Prav Mathema moved to increase his resources to deal with the issue. Hibbard’s 78th-minute injury was picked up on video analysis equipment, with the spotter subsequently ordering the team doctors via radio to remove the hooker from the pitch. ‘Prav has put in place a spotter with video access,’ said Gatland. ‘It’s pleasing because there’s been so much said about concussion.’","Wales beat Ireland to keep Six Nations challenge alive .

"Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini has stepped up his charm offensive in an attempt to spark a move for Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure. The former City manager wants to bring Toure to Milan after his spell as boss of the Ivorian midfielder powerhouse at the Etihad Stadium between 2010 and 2013. And Mancini has cheekily hinted that Toure would fancy a move to Italy after a difficult season with City chasing Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race. Yaya Toure (left) is wanted by Roberto Mancini (right) at Inter Milan after their time at Manchester City . Mancini poses with Aleksandar Kolarov, David Silva, Toure and Jerome Boateng (L-R) when signing them . 'Yaya has played in every top League, apart from Germany and Italy,' Mancini said. 'If, as it seems, he wants to have an experience in Italy, then there is this possibility he could come here. 'It won’t be easy, but he’s a player with incredible technique and character. Would Inter be his first choice? That’s certain.' Mancini claims Toure 'seems' to want a move to Inter Milan despite having two years left on his City contract . Mancini is back as Inter Milan manager and wants to bring high-profile players to Italy's Serie A . Toure has two years left on his City contract, and there seems no chance that the Premier League champions would be interested in selling a star player and part of the spine of Manuel Pellegrini's team. And Pellegrini has spoken out previously to confirm that Toure will not be leaving - not that it's stopping Mancini. Last month Pellegrini said: 'I don’t have an opinion about what another manager says about Yaya. 'Of course, every manager of every team would want Yaya in their team but I don’t have anything to say about that.' Toure rues a missed chance for City - and he has struggled to match their usual standards at times this year . Manuel Pellegrini says Mancini can forget about signing Toure but the Italian won't seem to back down . And Mancini certainly seems interested in his former players, having also tried to sign City youth product from Fiorentina, where he is on loan, in January. 'We did try to get him, as he was my player at City,' Mancini told Gazzetta TV. 'Fiorentina seemed open to it, but the move didn’t go through.' Mancini's Inter are struggling in Serie A this season and face missing out on Champions League football again, with the Nerazzurri sitting ninth in the table.","Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini wants Manchester City's Yaya Toure .

"They had earned a trophy and a promising title shot, but there was an appropriate lack of rejoicing by England on Saturday night. Wastefulness is no cause for euphoria. The Calcutta Cup had been retained, but the limitations of the opposition meant that was never in real doubt, despite considerable Scottish tenacity and occasional artistry. Stuart Lancaster, his assistants and his squad know that the standards they reached at Twickenham will not suffice against the leading rugby nations. England beat Scotland but they haven't shown enough to convince yet during the Six Nations . Defeating Scotland earned Chris Robshaw and his men a trophy, but they didn't do enough . The England squad smile for the cameras having defeated Scotland 25-13 to win the Calcutta Cup . 1st minute: George Ford sends Luther Burrell clear but he ignores Anthony Watson in space on the right and the door slams shut. 13th minute: Ben Youngs frees Mike Brown but the full-back — minus a boot — is chased down by Stuart Hogg close to the posts. 15th minute: The pack drive a scrum towards the Scottish line but Billy Vunipola is unable to pick up and touch down. 17th minute: Jack Nowell storms clear with two team-mates on either side but goes it alone, slips and cannot offload the ball. 31st minute: Burrell bursts through and sends Watson scorching to the line, but the ‘try’ is ruled out ny Romain Poite for a forward pass. 54th minute: Rampant England swarm into the visitors’ 22 but the attempted offload by Geoff Parling is pinched by Blair Cowan. 56th minute: Replacement hooker Tom Youngs makes a dazzling midfield charge but it comes to nothing as his pass flies between two supporting runners. 58th minute: Watson breaks from a ruck to the opposition 22 but runs away from Burrell and cannot release the centre to score. 62nd minute: Brown blasts over the Scottish 22 to score, but the ‘try’ is disallowed due to another forward pass in the build-up — this time by James Haskell. While the Red Rose is now planted at the top of the RBS Six Nations table, even shambolic France may be no push-overs in the tournament finale at Twickenham next Saturday if there is not a sharp up-turn in English precision. ‘If you look at the All Blacks, when they create a line break they usually end up scoring,’ said Lancaster. ‘We created 12 line breaks, which is a huge positive because I haven’t seen any team pull Scotland apart like that, but to only come away with three tries is frustrating. I think the players know that.’ They most certainly do. Ben Youngs was named man of the match for his efforts at scrum half, but he appeared underwhelmed by the manner of the victory. ‘We got what we wanted in terms of the result, but the scoreline should have been better,’ he admitted. There is a recurring concern for England. Composure — or a lack of it. They mustered plenty in Cardiff to turn the tide against Wales, but too often in tight games there are failures of decision-making or execution. The tone was set on Saturday by Luther Burrell, who didn’t manage to pass to the unmarked Anthony Watson on the Scottish 22. Put him in a Northampton shirt and the centre would surely make the pass and create the try. Yet, on this high-profile occasion, the chance was squandered. A similar error of judgment by Jonny May against Italy cost the Gloucester wing his place in the match-day squad, but Burrell is likely to escape the same fate due to the absence of injured Brad Barritt and reservations about Billy Twelvetrees. George Ford got England off to a perfect start in the second-half but the first half will have worried them . Exeter wing Jack Nowell crosses over to score England's third try and send them top of the Six Nations table . The Saints player was not the sole offender, with Jack Nowell at fault for ignoring support more than once. It may seem churlish to criticise the Exeter wing, who was dynamic and dangerous, but England urgently need a clinical edge. ‘It’s that composure after the line break,’ said Lancaster. ‘It was good on some occasions because we scored three good tries, but there were also missing elements and we need to fix those for next week.’ Jonathan Joseph continued his purple patch by touching down for the fourth time in as many games. But he was left irritated by the hosts’ profligate streak, too. ‘We made costly errors in the red zone in their 22 which let them off the hook,’ said the Bath centre. ‘We are creating those opportunities, now it’s just a matter of finishing them.’ England must not over-state their satisfaction at mere creation alone. On the one hand, Wales’ victory over Ireland was a source of great English joy, as it leaves Lancaster’s team with it all in their favour in the three-way tussle for the championship title. But with the bigger picture in mind, the red-shirted defensive heroism in Cardiff rammed home the need for England to become more ruthless. Soon. On the latest evidence, their closest World Cup Pool A rivals won’t be line-break fodder in the way Scotland so often were. No other country can match the All Blacks’ ability to expose and seize the jugular, but Lancaster will be painfully aware that his team cannot rely on a torrent of attacking possession. When England are equalled or trumped up front — as was the case against Ireland — they will require an executioner’s instinct. At least it was evident in one man on Saturday. George Ford wielded the conductor’s baton with staggering assurance for a 21-year-old. He invariably took the right option while going through his wide-ranging repertoire in helping to conjure the tries by Joseph and Nowell. He added one himself when the fractured Scottish defence opened up in front of him. Tom Youngs (centre) leads an England breakaway as Lancaster's side returned to the Six Nations summit . Anthony Watson runs clear but England repeatedly failed to take their chances at Twickenham on Saturday . Mike Brown was one of the better performers but England spurned too many opportunities at Twickenham . Ben Youngs hands off a tackle but the man of the match wasn't happy with his team's overall performance . Joseph, his club-mate at Bath, said: ‘I have played with George since Under 18s and he has always been that kind of player who thrives under pressure and more or less always delivers. He has been outstanding for us in the Six Nations.’ Five days from now, England can win the title using their home advantage and the benefit of playing last and by preying on simmering French doubts. But if ‘Le Crunch’ turns out to be a tense duel after all, they also need others to follow Ford’s lead by finding the mental conviction to make the right calls. The wastefulness can’t go on, or next time there may not be a trophy to soften the inquest.","England top Six Nations table after win against Scotland on Saturday .

Supporters were first posed a question regarding formation, and an incredible 92.1 per cent of fans called for Carlo Ancelotti to ditch his current tactics and revert to a 4-4-2 formation. Cristiano Ronaldo would be dropped by 32.2 per cent of Real Madrid fans, according to a poll in AS . Gareth Bale is the least popular of Madrid's  front three and nearly half the fans asked would bench him . Karim Benzema claims he is the 'first one to arrive and the last to leave' the Real Madrid training ground . Real Madrid fans were asked which of their front three should be dropped. Here are the results: . 1st: Gareth Bale - 46.1 per cent . 2nd: Cristiano Ronaldo - 32.2 per cent . 3rd: Karim Benzema - 21.7 per cent . That would mean one of Madrid's impressive front three, the so-called 'BBC' of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, would need to make way. In the poll, Bale, who has been jeered on a couple of occasions despite his impressive start in the Spanish capital, was top of the pile, while Ronaldo was second. Benzema, therefore, has proven to be the most popular member of Madrid's frontline; a stat which will surprise many given Ronaldo's previous success at the club. Bale picked up a worrying 46.1 per cent of the votes, while Ronaldo would be dropped by 32.2 per cent of supporters.

Los Blancos fell to a disappointing 1-0 loss at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and are now second in La Liga . Ancelotti stands in front of the bench - but could one of Ronaldo, Bale or Benzema soon be sitting there? Benzema should make way according to just 21.7 per cent of Madrid fans, and alongside the poll AS carry a quote from the French forward where he says: 'I'm the first one to arrive and the last to leave.' Perhaps that is an endearing quality that has helped his popularity in the Spanish capital. Madrid fell to a disappointing 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and before that could only manage a draw against Villarreal.

Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick as Barcelona went top of La Liga - things are much rosier at the Nou Camp . Suarez also got a brace as Barcelona went top of the league after beating Rayo Vallecano . An emphatic 6-1 win for Barcelona over Rayo Vallecano at the Nou Camp - the complete antithesis of Madrid's recent performances - has left Los Blancos a point behind their rivals at the top of La Liga. AS also reveal that since Christmas, the average goals-per-game ratio for Real Madrid has dropped from 2.6 to 1.3 - exactly half the amount they scored in the first half of the season. These are certainly worrying times at the Bernabeu. Tuesday night sees them take to the field in a vital Champions League last-16 tie against Schalke holding a 2-0 lead from the first leg. Following that, Madrid face Levante in the league, before a potentially title-defining clash at the Nou Camp. Sunday, March 22 - make or break for Ancelotti and his team.

"Ireland narrowly missed out on reaching the quarter-finals of the Cricket World Cup as they fell to a seven-wicket loss against Pakistan. William Porterfield had earlier struck his maiden World Cup century and Ireland were indebted to their captain as his 107 helped them post a modest 237 all out. However, the 30-year-old was outshone by Sarfraz Ahmed, whose unbeaten 101 led Pakistan through to the next stage of competition on net run-rate.

Thursday, March 19 - India v Bangladesh - Melbourne . Friday, March 20 - Australia v Pakistan - Adelaide . Saturday, March 21 - New Zealand v West Indies - Wellington . The sides’ had contrasting starts to the competition and it was associate side Ireland that began the better of the two; with victories over the West Indies and the UAE. Pakistan however, were on the end of heavy defeats against bitter rivals India and the West Indies and were facing increasing scrutiny over whether they were going to be able to seriously contend at this World Cup. But with the competition geared towards ensuring the ‘top-eight’ teams make it through to the knockout stages of the competition, all the sides knew even as little three wins could see a team advance. In hindsight the turning point in the tournament for Ireland came against South Africa, against whom they suffered a mammoth 201-run loss. The match obliterated their net run-rate. Ireland's Ed Joyce takes a catch to dismiss Pakistan's Shehzad for 63 runs . John Mooney of Ireland stands in the outfield as they attempted to beat Pakistan in Pool B . Meanwhile, Misbah-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s effervescent and immovable captain was slowly ensuring he continued to carry his side back to some respectability. A shock 29-run (D/L) victory over South Africa ensured the match against Ireland would be a straight knockout, after the West Indies guaranteed their safe passage to the quarter-finals with an easy victory against the UAE earlier in the day. Porterfield decided having runs on the board would be his side’s best chance of victory against the 1992 World Cup champions, having won the toss. Admittedly the Adelaide Oval pitch did look every bit the ‘batting paradise’ Shahid Afradi called it and despite missing their leader with the ball Mohammad Irfan, Pakistan had Ireland in all sorts of trouble early on. Paul Stirling went for three to World Cup debutant Ehsan Adil as he tried to play across the line and was trapped lbw. Despite surviving an early scare after being dropped by Shehzad on five, Ed Joyce failed to make the most of his reprieve as he top-edged a Wahab Riaz delivery to Umar Akmal at short square cover on 11. Spectators enjoy the atmosphere during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match at the Adelaide Oval . Gary Wilson of Ireland survives a run-out attempted during Ireland's batting innings . Pakistani players celebrate getting the wicket of William Porterfield of Ireland . Umar, relieved of his keeping duties in the previous match against South Africa, seemed rejuvenated and went on to become the joint-record holder with four catches as a fielder. But Ireland’s innings centered around their captain who, in what may well be Ireland’s final World Cup match, played some of his best cricket of the tournament as he made his hundred. As many batsmen do, Poterfield rode his luck – including being dropped on 99 by keeper Sarfraz and he scurried through for his century. It took an impressive catch from Afridi to finally dismiss the Irish captain for 107 off the economical Sohail Khan. The equation for Pakistan was simple, win or tie against Ireland and they would be through and Sarfraz and Shehzad’s 120-run first wicket partnership took them a large way towards their target. Though Shehzad (63) and Haris Sohail (3) fell in quick succession, Misbah steadied the ship and while the Pakistan captain ended up being dismissed in the most peculiar way - as he stood so far back to an Alex Cusack delivery that he tread on his stumps, Pakistan never looked in trouble. Porterfield (left) is congratulated by Ireland team-mate Wilson after reaching 100 runs . Ehsan Adil (centre) celebrates  after successfully appealing for LBW to dismiss Ireland's Paul Stirling . Although it was a comfortable victory, the end was slightly marred by Sarfraz’s insistence in obtaining his own personal milestone and rather than opting to take singles with Umar, he waited for the opportunity to clear the field. Had Ireland amassed a few more runs that dangerous strategy could have led a more serious issue for Pakistan. Ireland may be returning home earlier then they has hoped at the beginning of the day but they will at least be able to do so in the knowledge that they defeated more Test playing nations than England. It’s unlikely to be of much comfort to the associate side with their future in the competition unknown but Ireland along with the other associate sides – Scotland, Afghanistan and the UAE – showed in the past four weeks that the World Cup will truly miss them if the ICC has its way.

"South Africa's George Coetzee put home advantage to full use to win his second European Tour title in the Tshwane Open. Coetzee carded a flawless final round of 65 to finish one shot ahead of compatriot Jacques Blaauw at Pretoria Country Club, the course where he has been a member since taking up the game and won his first junior competition aged 10. Blaauw had charged through the field with a stunning closing 61 to equal the course record and set the clubhouse target at 13 under par, with the final groups still having nine holes to play. George Coetzee plays a shot during the final round of the Tshwane Open at Pretoria Country Club . Coetzee relaxes with the trophy after winning the second European Tour title of his career . However, Coetzee - who was one of six players sharing the lead overnight - was just one behind after finishing his front nine with three birdies in four holes and picked up two more shots on the back nine to seal victory. The decisive moment came on the 17th after Coetzee had tried to drive the green on the short par four. His tee shot came up in the trees, short of the green but with a clear path between two bunkers, and the world number 87 took full advantage, chipping to five feet and holing for a birdie to take a one-shot lead down the last. 'I think I've got this course down after 18 years of playing golf,' joked Coetzee, whose previous win also came on home soil at the Joburg Open last year. 'I know when I am comfortable hitting drivers and going for par fours or being aggressive and attacking flags and I think today played to my advantage knowing when to be aggressive and when not to. Coetzee  walks over a bridge with playing partner Trevor Fisher Jnr during the final round . 'I drew on my experiences of winning club championships here. I actually threw one away by playing it conservative on 17. So today it was quite an easy decision. I knew I was going to hit driver no matter what, because I don't know how to play that hole with an iron! 'To win at your home club, in front of all your friends and family, it's a great experience and a very special day for me. The crowds were amazing. I could just feel the momentum building and the crowd felt like it was getting bigger and bigger the closer we got to the end.' Speaking immediately after his round, Blaauw said: 'It was fun out there, everything just went in. 'I got a bit of luck on nine when I hit it left but had a swing and got it up and down it for birdie and then after that made some putts. It's always good to be in contention in these big events coming down the stretch.' Scotland's Craig Lee was just one off the lead when he carded his fourth birdie of the day on the 14th, but bogeyed the next and then took a double bogey on the last to drop back to nine under alongside South African pair Dean Burmester and Tjaart van der Walt.","Coetzee carded a flawless final round of 65 to finish one shot ahead of compatriot Jacques Blaauw at Pretoria Country Club .

"Team Sky took a one-two on the fourth stage of Paris-Nice as Richie Porte crossed the line just ahead of Geraint Thomas. The British team showed their strength on the final climb of the Croix de Chaubouret and the pair punched the air after both making valuable moves towards the yellow jersey. The pack had already thinned out considerably when Welshman Thomas made his big move with three kilometres to go of the longest stage of the race. It was a Team Sky one-two on the fourth stage of Paris-Nice secured by Richie Porte and Geraint Thomas . Australian Porte then kicked away one kilometre from the finish and it was only Thomas who was able to go with him. Michal Kwiatkowski was third, eight seconds adrift, and that was enough for the Pole to reclaim the overall race lead by a single second, with Porte now next in line and Thomas another two seconds behind in third. Porte, the race winner in 2013, told the Team Sky website: 'That was a great performance from the team. We took it on from the bottom of that last climb. It wasn't easy on there, so to finish first and second is fantastic. Porte celebrates on the podium after winning the fourth stage, and he is now eyeing another overall win .

"England cricket hero Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff was left 'shocked' after being crowned King of the Jungle in Australia's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. The 37-year-old former all-rounder beat AFL legend Barry Hall to win the grand final on Sunday after enduring a rollercoaster ride in the South African jungle. Earlier he had told host Chris Brown: 'As an Englishmen winning something in Australia, it's unheard of. Scroll down for video . Freddie Flintoff was crowned King Of The Jungle on I'm A Celebrity...

I don't like insects, snakes, the dark…' Reflecting on his experience in the camp he said: 'I've just tried to take everything out of it, no point moping around. I love meeting new people it's been nice. 'Friendships get accelerated in the camp, so I dropped my guard and spoke about things. It came down to the English cricketer and AFL legend Barry Hall (R) who became good friends in the end . 'I've spoken about my depression in the UK before, it's not something I'm ashamed of, it's something I do. I spent a lot of time hating myself.' Earlier in the program Flintoff, was unknowingly led to his wife and mother of this three children Rachael in an emotional reunion. Gasping as he realised it was her, the two embraced as she ran to kiss him cupping his face. Flintoff was announced as winner as show hosts Julia Morris and Chris Brown fussed over him . 'It was a bit embarrassing,' he later said. 'I must have stunk.' 'He stunk,' she later agreed, adding: 'But he's smelt worst before. It was so lovely to see him.'

"Bangladesh gave co-hosts New Zealand a real scare but fell just short of securing another Pool A victory at the World Cup on Friday. The Tigers established a strong position thanks to a ton from top-scoring Mahmudullah, yet New Zealand boasted a centurion of their own in Martin Guptill, who shrugged off injury to make 105 at Seddon Park. Shakib Al Hasan was the pick of the bowlers with his four wickets maintaining belief Bangladesh could restrict the Black Caps in Hamilton. A late flurry from Tim Southee, however, got the home team over the line as they recorded a three-wicket triumph. New Zealand batsman Martin Guptill hits a pull shot during his side's game against Bangladesh on Friday . Guptill pulls up with cramp while on 99 as the Black Caps chased the Tigers total in Hamilton . Guptill recovered from his injury to score his century and finish with 105 as New Zealand remained unbeaten . Both sides had already qualified for the quarter-finals, but the result is perhaps more heartening for the Tigers. They registered 288 for seven from their 50 overs, having been put into bat. Mahmudullah, having become his country's first World Cup centurion in Monday's win over England, made it back-to-back hundreds with a brilliant 128 not out. The Bangladesh innings got off to a shaky start, with openers Imrul Kayes (two) and Tamim Iqbal (13) dismissed within the first 10 overs. Mahmudullah followed up his century against England on Monday with another ton against the Black Caps . Trent Boult snared both, knocking over Kayes' off stump and inducing an edge from Tamim which was snapped up by Corey Anderson at second slip to send the bowler back top of the 2015 World Cup wicket-takers' list. Soumya Sarkar (51) and Mahmudullah steadied the ship with a 90-run third-wicket stand, before the former bottom-edged a Daniel Vettori delivery to Anderson at long-on. Anderson then got in on the action with the ball, accounting for the wickets of Al Hasan (23) and Mushfiqur Rahim (15) - both caught behind by Luke Ronchi. Sabbir Rahman contributed 40 and Nasir Hossain 11 before falling to Grant Elliott in the final three overs. Nasir Hossain drops a catch that would have dismissed New Zealand's Daniel Vettori . New Zealand also made a wobbly start, quickly losing both Brendon McCullum and Kane Williamson. The former was snagged by Al Hasan for eight while Williamson sliced over to Iqbal for a single off the same bowler. It fell to Guptill and Ross Taylor to steady the ship and the pair brought up 50 runs before the latter reached 5,000 ODI runs with a four off Rahman. Corey Anderson made 39 runs to help New Zealand to a 290 for 7 victory against Bangladesh . Guptill was fast approaching his century when he suddenly pulled up after glancing for a single. After a few nervous minutes it became clear the opener was suffering from a bad bout of cramps. He gritted his teeth and soon brought up his maiden World Cup ton with a single off Taskin Ahmed. Guptill was, however, gone for 105 when Al Hasan struck again, the Bangladesh bowler making another key breakthrough as his opponent tried to clear Rubel Hossain only to find him at long on. Elliott had contributed 39 runs before slicing to Ahmed at sweeper cover and succumbing to Rubel . Tim Southee proved the matchwinner for New Zealand as he smashed a six and a four in back-to-back balls . Taylor followed in the 42nd over, Hossain striking him in front of middle and leg. Anderson's intervention meant the decision went to review, but DRS confirmed the end of his 56-run stand. Ronchi (nine) became Shakib's fourth victim and Anderson followed for 39 as Nasir tricked him with a flatter delivery, but the Black Caps held their nerve. Southee was the matchwinner, sealing a three-wicket victory as he smashed a six and a four in back-to-back balls.","Martin Guptill shrugged off injury to make 105 for New Zealand .

The midfielder, pictured in action against Arsenal on Sunday, joined Everton in the summer of 2013 for £13m . McCarthy signed a five-year contract on summer deadline day in 2013 but is not one of Everton's big earners and the nature of the last-minute negotiations meant assurances were given that his deal would be revised as his Goodison career progressed. However, though other Everton players have since opened discussions over new terms, McCarthy has yet to be approached. Tim Howard, Seamus Coleman, Ross Barkley and John Stones all agreed new deals last year with manager Roberto Martinez, who himself signed a new deal last June, seeking to maintain a long-term core to his squad. Ross Barkley is one of a number of young players to have signed a new long-term deal with Everton . McCarthy has not been approached about a new contract despite his good form for the Toffees . McCarthy, a Republic of Ireland international, has matured into one of the most consistent Premier League players and shown his ability on the international and European stage. In Everton's 4-1 Europa League rout of Wolfsburg earlier this season he had a pass completion rate of 98 per cent. He is highly regarded at Everton and his influence on the team was sorely missed when he was out with a hamstring injury; in the 13 games Everton played without him, they won just one. Arsenal and Tottenham have both watched him since his return to the fold but were put off January bids knowing Everton would refuse all offers. Arsenal and Tottenham are still interested in Southampton's defensive midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (left) Manchester United are considering McCarthy as an alternative to Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman (right) Everton's faltering season though has given them a sense a deal could be brokered in the summer. Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin remains on their list of options too. United have concerns that Roma's Kevin Strootman may not recover quickly from his latest knee surgery and are assessing other options across Europe. McCarthy has over 150 Premier League games under his belt already and at 24 has his best years ahead of him.","James McCarthy has attracted interest from a number of clubs this season .

"Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson has laid into Mario Balotelli after the Liverpool striker's latest faltering performance in the goalless draw with Blackburn in Sunday's FA Cup quarter final. The misfiring Italy international, who has managed only four goals in all competitions since his £16million summer arrival from AC Milan, was brought on after 59 minutes but failed to impress as the game ended 0-0 to force a replay at Ewood Park. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Lawrenson let fly with a scathing attack on the former Manchester City star who he labelled 'a waste of space'. Mario Balotelli leaves Anfield after Liverpool's goalless draw with Blackburn in the FA Cup . The much criticised striker failed to get on the scoresheet during the FA Cup quarter final clash . The Italian firebrand came on after 59minutes but could not add to his meagre goal tally of four this season . Liverpool legend and BBC pundit let loose a scathing attack on Balotelli, branding him 'a waste of space' The 24-year-old has failed to live up to expectations following his £16million arrival at Anfield . Balotelli heads straight down the tunnel towards the dressing room after the final whistle is blown . 'Forget about Mario Balotelli. He is an absolute waste of time. He shouldn't be anywhere near this team,' he said. 'I can see why Brendan Rodgers threw him on today as he might just create something, but 99 times out of 100 he will let you down.' Match Zone statistics  from the game show that Balotelli managed only a single shot on target after coming on as a substitute and appear to support Lawrenson's claims. Balotelli's performance comes just days after he posted a cryptic Instagram message suggesting that one of his team-mates did not like him. Although, having angered players by taking a penalty away from Jordan Henderson during a Europa League clash with Besiktas and with statistics that include only creating six chances for his team-mates all season, it's hardly surprising that the 24-year-old's popularity is waning. Balotelli prepares to be introduced on 51minutes as Liverpool try and change the game . Balotelli has managed only four goals in all competitions since arriving from AC Milan last summer . Mario Balotelli's attack statistics and heat map for the 31minutes he played on Sunday back up Mark Lawrenson's claims - CLICK HERE for more stats from our Match Zone . Lawrenson praised Blackburn for their tactically astute performance to earn a replay at Ewood Park, which has now been scheduled for April 7 or 8th to meet UEFA regulations. 'Congratulations to Blackburn Rovers on an absolutely magnificent display. They were never ever desperate at any time,' he said. 'They have looked at how Liverpool have played recently and the tactics were spot on. Goalkeeper Simon Eastwood hasn't really had to make a real top class save.' Rodgers admitted that he would rather wait a month for the replay than have to play 48 hours later as has happened to Bradford and Reading after their goalless draw on Saturday.

Balotelli wins a header but could not get his shot on target as Liverpool stumble to a draw . ‘I believe the replay is early April, the 7th or 8th,’ said Rodgers. ‘It is certainly not what it is for Reading and Bradford. That is unbelievable. I feel for them, having to play Saturday and again on Monday. It is incredible. It’s unfair for both clubs with so much at stake. I feel sorry for Parky and for Steve and for the players.’ The game at Anfield was marred by a head injury to defender Martin Skrtel who required eight minutes of treatment after losing consciousness from landing awkwardly. He was eventually taken off on a stretcher, having played only a few minutes. Balotelli angered his team-mates by taking a penalty away from Jordan Henderson in the Europa League . Martin Skrtel was knocked unconscious after an awkward fall and required eight minutes of treatment .

"Sergei Rebrov has issued Arsenal with a 'hands-off' warning amid talk the Gunners are keen to sign Dynamo Kiev defender Aleksandar Dragovic. The former Tottenham and West Ham striker returns to England as a manager with his Dynamo Kiev side taking on Everton in the Europa League on Thursday night. Reports suggest Arsene Wenger is keen on Austria international Dragovic but Rebrov said: 'You are asking about one of the best players in my team and I don't want to lose this player.

'He is a top-class player and I hope he will stay with us.' Rebrov flopped during a five-year spell in England after moving to Spurs in an £11million deal back in 2000. However, despite struggling in the Premier League, Rebrov is still a keen observer of the English top-flight and is pleased to see how Tottenham are performing. The former Ukraine international - who scored over 100 goals during two spells with Kiev - also praised young Tottenham striker Harry Kane who has scored 16 Premier League goals for Mauricio Pochettino's side this term.

Rebrov joined Tottenham in an £11million deal back in 2000 but flopped during a five-year spell in England . Asked if he still takes an interest in his former clubs, the Dynamo Kiev manager said: 'Of course I am still following Tottenham, West Ham - all the teams I played for. 'I'm glad because I think Tottenham are getting better. Harry Kane is a very good forward, scoring not just lots but some very important goals. 'I'm also very pleased for my good friend Tim Sherwood (his former Tottenham team-mate), who is doing a good job as Aston Villa manager. Rebrov still looks out for his former club and is pleased with how Tottenham and Harry Kane are performing . 'The Premier League is always interesting for me, whether you are playing in it or just watching it. And it is a very hard league.' Meanwhile, Everton will be looking for a positive result in the first leg of their Europa League last 16 tie  having endured a disappointing domestic season. Roberto Martinez's side are currently 14th in the Premier League, six points above the drop zone, but have impressed in Europe and beat Swiss side Young Boys 7-2 on aggregate in the previous round.

"Lewis Hamilton began the new Formula One season in stunning fashion with a crushing qualifying performance to grab the fourth pole position of his career for the Australian Grand Prix. It is clear that after a dominant 2014 from Mercedes they will again be the team to beat in 2015 as reigning champion Hamilton blasted his way to top spot on the grid at Melbourne's Albert Park, putting even team-mate Nico Rosberg in the shade. Hamilton finished with a lap of one minute 26.327secs, a staggering 0.6secs clear of Rosberg as Mercedes locked out the front row, with Williams' Felipe Massa the best of the rest, but 1.4secs down on the 30-year-old Briton. Now, click here to read Jonathan McEvoy's report from Melbourne... Host commentator . 1. Hamilton . 2. Rosberg . 3 Massa . 4 Vettel . 5 Raikkonen . 6 Bottas . 7 Ricciardo . 8 Sainz . 9 Grosjean . 10 Maldonado . Rosberg crosses the line, but it is only good enough for P2, a mighty half-a-second down on Hamilton. He had an awful first sector, but was quicker than Hamilton in the final sector. Bottas wobbles out of the final corner, but he still does enough to qualify fourth and Hamilton is going even quicker... Hamilton complaining about his tyres on his out-lap from the pit-lane... will it make a difference? Ricciardo is the first driver on a timed lap. He crosses the line to clock a 1:28.329 to move him up to third, but here comes Kimi and he goes third above Ricciardo. Right, here we go for the final runs of the afternoon. Can anyone beat Hamilton to Australian Grand Prix pole? All of the drivers are back in their respective garages and it is Hamilton from Vettel, Massa, Raikkonen, Maldonado, Ricciardo, Grosjean and Sainz. Neither Rosberg nor Bottas have posted a time. Hamilton crosses the line and the Briton posts a 1.26:419 which is 1.3 seconds quicker than the next driver in Vettel, but Rosberg runs WIDE at the penultimate corner and takes a trip across the grass. He aborts his lap and dives into the pit-lane. The German will now have just one shot at pole. Bottas complaining about his brakes during a sloppy lap for the Finn which has seen him slide all over the track in his Williams. The cars flood out on to the Albert Park track for their first runs in the top-10 shootout. Rosberg, in his Mercedes, is the last driver to leave the pit-lane. Game on. The final 12-minute session is underway in Melbourne... Hamilton or Rosberg? Rosberg or Hamilton? Place your bets now. Here’s a frustrated Will Stevens, who hasn’t taken to the track in his Manor this weekend: It is frustrating for me and the team. We want to be out on the track. The cars are ready to go but there are a few gremlins which are keeping us back. I want to be out there as much as anything. Coming from Abu Dhabi last year I know what a race meeting is like. I am heading back to the UK, but I know the team are heading out early to Malaysia so we will be in better shape than we are now. There are a few issues with the software which means we can’t get out there. 17-year-old Max Verstappen will start a commendable 12th on his grand prix debut, but the Dutchman has been out-qualified by his team-mate. Carlos Sainz Jnr, also on his F1 bow, sticks his Toro Rosso in Q3. Home favourite Ricciardo is on a hot-lap here as he looks to cement his place in the top-10 shootout. He crosses the line with a 1:28.679 to bump him up to sixth, and receives a smattering of applause from the Melbourne crowd. Hamilton and Rosberg are happy they've done enough, and they are back in the Mercedes garage. Remember, five drivers will be eliminated from this 15-minute session. It's Kvyat, Nasr, Hulkenberg and Perez in the drop-zone with two minutes to run. Back on track, and Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg. The Briton is some two tenths quicker than his Mercedes team-mate. It is Bottas up next, albeit over one second down on Hamilton. And here is a gloomy, but ever-positive, JENSON BUTTON: ‘I think the positives are, looking at winter testing it was difficult, having issues and running short, and suddenly you put a team at a race weekend and you have to stick to the schedule. It was never going to be competitive here but still there is a good feeling about the car. The basic car is there. It is nice that Honda have a bit more experience today. It is going to be a really difficult tomorrow. We have not done a race distance yet.’ The second session is underway and the Sauber of Felipe Nasr is the first driver to take to the track. We must mention that his team-mate Marcus Ericsson was the other non-McLaren driver to be eliminated from Q1. KEVIN MAGNUSSEN: I don’t think we expected anything else. It is tough. It is a learning process and we have got to be patient. Going forward is the main priority. We need to learn from the race. Stunning. Both McLaren drivers are ELIMINATED from the opening qualifying session of 2015. Button improves his time to leapfrog Magnussen, but they will start 17th and 18th respectively. They will start on the final row of the grid. Ouch. Kvyat is given one timed lap to stick his Red Bull into Q2 and he posts a 1:30.402 which is good enough for P13... but what can the McLarens do? But Sainz pops his Toro Rosso into P4 and Maldonado goes ninth. That leaves Magnussen and Button in the drop-zone. Kvyat, yet to take to the track, with less than five minutes. With Manor not running, only three drivers will be eliminated from Q1; Pastor Maldonado and Carlos Sainz are the two drivers set to miss out... Hamilton quickly usurps Rosberg however, and he tops the timesheets in Melbourne. Five minutes to go. But Rosberg, still on the medium compound tyres, pops in a 1:28.906 to go fastest. So, with eight minutes to go in Q1, Vettel leads from Bottas, Raikkonen, Hamilton, Massa, Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Verstappen, Grosjean and Perez. Rosberg, on the medium compound - remember Ferrari are on the softer, quicker compound - goes fourth, a second slower than Vettel. Sainz has a wee spin in his Toro Rosso as Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:30.277.  That leaves him in third behind the two Ferraris. Back on track and it is Kimi Raikkonen with a 1:30.188 who goes easily fastest. And his new Ferrari team-mate, the four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, is even quicker. The German crosses the line some seven tenths faster than Raikkonen. Hamilton, on the medium compound takes a wee trip across the grass on his out-lap. Not the ideal start to qualifying from the Brit there. He is reporting 'really big vibrations' on his current set of tyres. Sainz is the first to cross the line and he pops in a 1:33.094. Hamilton meanwhile, is out on track in his Mercedes. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that Manor, who pulled everything out of the bag to make it to Melbourne, will not take part in qualifying so they will not race this weekend. The pit-lane is open and the first of three qualifying sessions is underway at Albert Park. It is the Toro Rosso of Carlos Sainz Jnr who is the first driver to take to the track… .

Click on Sportsmail's brilliant interactive guide to find out everything you need to know about the 20 races which make up this year's calendar. The British driver and his team-mate Kevin Magnussen, who is deputising for the injured Fernando Alonso, endured a miserable day during practice for the season opener at the Albert Park Circuit. The McLaren pair, hampered by reliability problems to their new Honda engine, managed only 13 laps between them in Friday’s opening session and were five seconds down on Nico Rosberg’s best time for Mercedes. So, with 10 minutes to go until the start of qualifying, why not catch up on the very latest news from Melbourne, starting with Hamilton and his hope that he will be remembered as a legend when he retires from Formula One. The British team have renewed their iconic relationship with Japanese engine supplier Honda, the Japanese engine supplier which saw McLaren win four straight drivers’ and constructors’ titles between 1988 and 1991. But they’ve struggled in winter testing, and it hasn’t got any better in Melbourne. Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen, standing in for the absent Fernando Alonso, propped up the timesheets yesterday. And they, along with the Red Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat, were slowest again this morning. But Button remains, retained by McLaren for a sixth season, remains typically optimistic: ‘This is the package I think will challenge Mercedes. I really think that…. It is just going to take some time.’ Lewis Hamilton ended both practice sessions behind Nico Rosberg yesterday, but the Briton was back on top this morning. He was almost one second clear of Sebastian Vettel with Rosberg in third. Good morning and welcome to MailOnline’s coverage for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. We kick off our live coverage for 2015 with qualifying at Albert Park, the traditional host to the first Formula One race of the campaign. Lewis Hamilton is the overwhelming favourite to defend his crown which he won so dramatically last year. But his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who finished runner-up in 2014, is expected to be nipping at his gearbox throughout what promises to be another scintillating campaign. We’ll cover every qualifying and race live, so stick with us from the season opener in Melbourne right down to the final race of the campaign in Abu Dhabi eight months from now… .","Lewis Hamilton will start Sunday's Australian Grand Prix from pole .

"Modou Barrow is set to join Nottingham Forest on loan until the end of the season. The 22-year-old is expected to complete the move in the coming days, with Swansea manager Garry Monk keen for the winger to get first-team football. Sportsmail understands an agreement has been reached, but paperwork for the deal has not been completed. Swansea City's Modou Barrow is expected to join Nottingham Forest on loan until the end of the season . The 22-year-old winger is expected to complete the move in the coming days . Barrow joined Swansea from Swedish club Ostersunds last September and quickly landed an improved four-year contract last month. Club staff have been deeply impressed by his progress, but having made only one Premier League start this season it has been deemed necessary to send him to the Championship club for extra experience.

"Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer says the club's owners do not wish to lose striker Jordan Rhodes. The 25-year-old has been the subject of an offer from Middlesbrough while Nottingham Forest, Derby, Norwich and Sheffield Wednesday have also expressed interest. Rhodes scored Blackburn's last minute winner against Bolton on Wednesday night and Bowyer says Rovers owners Venky’s share his stance on not letting the Scotland international leave on loan to a rival Championship club. Jordan Rhodes, pictured scoring against Bolton, has been linked with a move away from Ewood Park . Rhodes directed the ball past Bolton goalkeeper Ben Amos to hit Blackburn's winner . Bowyer said: 'They (Venky's) are of the same opinion as ourselves – why would we want to be doing that?' Boro manager Aitor Karanka asked if he could confirm Boro’s approach, said: 'I don’t need to speak about speculation because we have a lot of games in front of us that are very important. 'Jordan Rhodes is not our player so I prefer to speak about our players.' Pushed again he said: 'If, if, if. We could bring in Ronaldo and Messi, (that) could be good for everybody.' Forest manager Dougie Freedman admitted his side have given up hope of signing Rhodes. Freedman told BBC Radio Nottingham: 'I phoned Gary Bowyer and he was very open and honest with me saying Jordan was not going out on loan so that was the end of the conversation. 'There was a rumour in the game that he could be going out on loan and I’m a big admirer of Jordan so out of respect I phoned Gary. 'I spoke to him and said if that was to come up we’d be interested in loaning Jordan with a view to a permanent if we did go up and he just squashed it straight away.'

"In a season when Manchester United’s aspirations have been peeled away like layers of an onion, the only goal left is qualification for the Champions League. It is enough to make even the steadfast shed a tear. Thrashed in the Capital One Cup by League One MK Dons and dumped out of the FA Cup by one of their own, United were never even in the Premier League title race. Entry back into Europe’s elite competition would represent a positive campaign however. The minimal requirement, undoubtedly, but a mark of improvement nonetheless. Something to look forward to. Manchester United have not beaten a team in the top half of the Premier League since Liverpool in December . Failure to finish in the top four would be pretty disastrous though. Without the extra commitment of a European campaign and having held a healthy lead in this run at one stage, falling late would ask serious questions of Louis van Gaal. It would probably mean entry into the Europa League instead – a nightmare scenario adding games in a competition United would rather avoid entirely. The continent’s purgatory. United face a difficult run-in, with 10 games to define their season. Four of their next five matches are against the top six but Van Gaal’s side have not beaten a team currently in the top half of the table since December. Here,Sportsmail assesses their chances. Man United vs Tottenham (March 15) Reverse fixture: 0-0 . A struggle for life, is how Van Gaal termed the second half of the sides’ dour draw at White Hart Lane on December 28. A repeat would be intolerable not only to watching fans but in the table. United must win, and beware Harry Kane. The 21-year-old striker already has 26 goals to his name this season - more than the supposedly stellar line-up of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao have managed for United combined. Besides, Mauricio Pochettino's men have Champions League ambitions of their own, and will be desperate for a victory over one of their chief rivals for the top four. Prediction: 2-1 United . Manchester United train ahead of their crunch Premier League clash against Tottenham on Sunday . Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Radamel Falcao are all smiles despite their side's recent struggles . Football data analysts BSports believe a Manchester United home win is easily the most likely outcome . March 15: Tottenham (home) March 22: Liverpool (away) April 4: Aston Villa (home) April 12: Man City (home) April 18: Chelsea (away) April 26: Everton (away) May 2: West Brom (home) May 9: Crystal Palace (away) May 16: Arsenal (home) May 24: Hull (away) Liverpool vs Man United (March 22) Reverse fixture: 3-0 United . The match at Old Trafford sparked Liverpool’s remarkable resurgence into the Champions League hunt. This game could prove the deciding factor. Brendan Rodgers has his side buoyant and Anfield will be bouncing. Van Gaal should douse the flames with his selection. But, with Philippe Coutinho rampant, Raheem Sterling offering pace and dynamism simply not seen in United's team and Daniel Sturridge now back in action after injury,the Dutchman will need a tactical masterstroke to pull off victory. This is arguably the fiercest rivalry in the land as England's two most successful clubs go head-to-head. Anfield will be rocking with the added incentive that Van Gaal's head could be on the block if he fails to finish in the top four. Prediction: 1-1 . Man United vs Aston Villa (April 4) Reverse fixture: 1-1 . Tim Sherwood led Spurs to victory in his previous visit to Old Trafford as a manager, and Villa are showing signs of vibrancy under his charge. They need points for survival and will fight all the way for it. Surely United will have too much quality though. Could arguably be the easiest fixture in United's run-in. But, as we've seen these last two seasons, anything is possible in the post-Fergie era. Prediction: 2-0 United . Man United vs Man City (April 12) Reverse fixture: 1-0 City . Sergio Aguero got the decisive goal at the Etihad on an afternoon Chris Smalling lost his head and City were denied three clear penalties. Manuel Pellegrini’s team have not often been at their best since, but their firepower can be awesome when focused on the right target. Such as their biggest rivals. This will be a third Manchester derby at Old Trafford at this stage in three consecutive seasons. City have won the past two. 6-1, anyone? United have rarely got near their noisy neighbours in recent years. And City's focus could be entirely focused on overhauling Chelsea's Premier League lead after their likely Champions League elimination in Barcelona. But Old Trafford will not stand for their men surrendering as meekly as during last season's grim 3-0 defeat. Prediction: 1-1 . Sergio Aguero is likely to cause the United defence problems in next month's Manchester derby . Chelsea vs Man United (April 18) Reverse fixture: 1-1 . Robin van Persie’s late equalising goal got Old Trafford to its feet and hoping a turning point had been found. It proved to be a false dawn and Chelsea have eased away at the top. Out of Europe, Jose Mourinho’s side are unlikely to lose focus as their hunt for the title reaches its closing moments. Men like John Terry, Nemanja Matic and Diego Costa will surely not let that happen, and the Blues' mixture of power, pace and potency should see them too good for United. PSG did, however, expose chinks in Chelsea's armour. Whether Angel Di Maria, Ashley Young et al are strong enough to pierce those gaps is another matter, . Prediction 2-1 Chelsea . Eden Hazard has been Chelsea's stand out player this season as they bid to recapture the title . Everton vs Man United (April 26) Reverse fixture: 2-1 United . Radamel Falcao appeared like a tiger to pounce for the winning goal at Old Trafford but the once-feared predator has experienced the wilderness since. Defeat at Goodison Park did for David Moyes last season although the ground does hold happier memories for United. But Everton are in a scrap themselves. Defeat this weekend and a victory for QPR or Burnley could leave Roberto Martinez's men just three points off the dreaded drop zone. Surely that would be the wake-up call Everton need to spark their season into life at long last. Prediction: 1-1 . Romelu Lukaku could cause United problems if he can carry his European form into the Premier League . Man United vs West Brom (May 2) Reverse fixture: 2-2 . Twice United came from behind to salvage a point at the Hawthorns, with Daley Blind’s measured effort the point-clincher. West Brom are a tougher nut to crack these days under Tony Pulis but the need for victory will weigh heavy on the hosts. The Baggies were also one of the teams to spring a shock at Old Trafford last season, when Saido Berahino and Morgan Amalfitano stunned David Moyes. Expect Berahino to score at Old Trafford again, but United to have the edge with more to play for than their visitors. Prediction: 2-1 United . Tony Pulis has transformed West Brom's fortunes and his side will be a stern test for United in May . Crystal Palace vs Man United (May 9) Reverse fixture: 1-0 United . Juan Mata, remember him? The Spaniard popped up for the winner in the season’s earlier game, an example of United at their most stubborn - performing poorly but still grinding out a win. Another illustration at Selhurst Park would do just fine. But that is easier said than done, with Alan Pardew having galvanised Palace since his return to Selhurst Park. Silencing the Eagles' ferocious home support in a big game towards the end of the season is no easy task - just ask Liverpool. But surely Van Gaal can squeeze a win here. Prediction: 1-0 United . Juan Mata scored the only goal of the game when United hosted Crystal Palace earlier in the season . Man United vs Arsenal (May 16) Reverse fixture: 2-1 United . A smash and grab to make John Dillinger blush, United stole three points from the Emirates in a game they ought to have lost. Angel Di Maria and Wayne Rooney showed a fleeting impression of understanding too. Arsenal have since shown that they know how to win at Old Trafford, thanks to the Danny Welbeck-inspired win in the FA Cup on Monday in which United struggled to get break down their opponents and were outfought as well as out-thought. But Monday's FA Cup defeat has pained United. That Welbeck was the man to deliver the knockout blow stings even more. Expect revenge. Prediction: 2-1 United . Danny Welbeck scored the winner as Arsenal dumped United out of the FA Cup earlier this week . Hull vs Man United (May 24) Reverse fixture: 3-0 United . The last time United visited the KC Stadium on the final day Sir Alex Ferguson fielded an inexperienced side having wrapped up the title and with a Champions League final against Barcelona on the horizon. How times have changed. Steve Bruce’s side could be safe by then and less motivated. But if they're not, this fixture becomes loaded full of danger - for both sides. You would back the United of old to win this encounter every time, but can you say the same about Van Gaal's version? Prediction: 1-0 United . Total predicted points: 74. United won the title with just one point more in 1996/97 but the parameters have shifted since then. Last year under Moyes they finished seventh on 64 points, while Arsenal came fourth on 79. Close call on whether 74 would be enough this time.","Manchester United's only remaining goal is to finish in the top four .

"Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin is in line for a new contract following his breakthrough into the first-team. The Gunners want to tie the right-back down to a new long-term deal after a string of impressive displays in replacing the injured Mathieu Debuchy. Bellerin's current deal expires in 2017, but he is now set to extend his stay at the Emirates Stadium. Hector Bellerin has been in the Arsenal first team of late, and will be rewarded with a contract extension . The young defender is now a key part of Arsene Wenger's first team squad after some impressive displays . It is common practice at Arsenal to hand improved contracts to young players who make a consistent impact on the first-team. The 19-year-old has made 17 appearances for the club already this season, firmly establishing himself as a regular member of Arsene Wenger's first-team squad. The news casts further doubt over Carl Jenkinson's career at the Emirates Stadium. With Mathieu Debuchy out injured, Bellerin has become the club's reliable full back ahead of Calum Chambers .

"Juventus general manager Giuseppe Marotta insists the Serie A outfit is the ideal place for Paul Pogba to grow into one of the world's best players. Pogba's agent Mino Raiola has hinted that the Frenchman could be keen on leaving the Old Lady in the summer, with the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City and Real Madrid all said to be interested in the 21-year-old. However Marotta has responded to Raiola by insisting the club will have the final say on Pogba's future. Juventus general manager Giuseppe Marotta believes Paul Pogba should stay at the Serie A giants . Pogba has been linked with a move to the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City and Real Madrid . Marotta, speaking to reporters, said: 'His sports rights are with Juventus only, so it is Juventus who will decide. 'However, the decision of the player is definitely critical. But, beyond this, we're speaking about a boy who is 21-years-old, he is very young, I think he can grow from game-to-game. 'Here is the natural habitat for him - for his growth and his development. We recently extended his contract and we did with the perspective of wanting to build a competitive team around him.'

"Manchester United have not told Monaco they won't be taking up the £43million option to make Radamel Falcao's move to Old Trafford permanent. Reports in France on Wednesday claimed United officials had been in touch with their counterparts in the principality to inform them that there would be no move for the misfiring Colombian at the end of the season. But a source at Old Trafford told Sportsmail that no decision has yet been made on Falcao and added that none would be forthcoming until May. Manchester United will delay making a decision over Radamel Falcao's future until the end of the season . Falcao has just over three months to convince Louis van Gaal that he is worthy of a £43m transfer fee . The 29-year-old, once one of the most feared strikers in the game, has struggled for form at United since he made the switch from Monaco in the summer. He suffered a serious cruciate ligament injury last January that saw him miss the World Cup and some have questioned whether he can return to the same level. Falcao penned a season-long deal with United but has scored just four goals in 20 appearances - a record that would appear to scupper any chances of his agreement being made permanent. However, an injury to Robin van Persie means Falcao is likely to get more chances to show manager Louis van Gaal why he should keep him at the end of the season. The Colombia international has scored four Premier League goals since joining from Monaco . Falcao is expected to benefit from an injury to Manchester United team-mate Robin van Persie .","Man United will make decision over Radamel Falcao's future in summer .

"Mercedes dominated free practice at Formula One's season-opening Australian Grand Prix on Friday, with Nico Rosberg edging his world champion team-mate Lewis Hamilton to top the timesheets in both sessions. German Rosberg, last year's championship runner-up, set the fastest lap of 1:27.697secs in the second session on a glorious day at Albert Park, topping Hamilton by one tenth of a second. Rosberg was also quickest in the first session, his best time of 1:29.557secs edging Hamilton as the constructors' champions carried their ominous form from winter testing onto the track.

But with Vettel's fastest time over seven tenths of a second adrift of Rosberg, the opening day's practice will strengthen belief that the first rounds of the new season may be a private duel for race wins between the Mercedes duo. Williams driver Valtteri Bottas posted the fifth-fastest lap, with Red Bull's new recruit Daniil Kvyat sixth in the second session. Kvyat's team-mate Daniel Ricciardo had a less memorable day. Tenth fastest in the first session, Ricciardo was forced to sit out the second after an engine problem, a fate also shared by Williams driver Felipe Massa. Toro Rosso's 17-year-old driver Max Verstappen impressed with the sixth-fastest time of the first session, before falling back to 14th-quickest in the second.

"Manchester United and Tottenham target Memphis Depay could leave PSV Eindhoven in the summer, the club's director has admitted. The 21-year-old, a Holland international, attracted interest after impressing at the World Cup in Brazil, with Tottenham even tabling a €20million (£14.6m) bid for the forward, which was turned down. But PSV director Toon Gerbrands is resigned to the fact that he is likely to leave when the next transfer window opens in June. Memphis Depay (right), in action on Sunday night against Ajax, is attracting interest from the Premier League . The 21-year-old forward has scored 21 goals in 31 appearances for PSV Eindhoven so far this season . Louis van Gaal is interested in the player, who he called up to the Holland squad for the World Cup in Brazil . 'Tottenham were willing to offer €20m for Depay,' he told Dutch broadcaster NOS. 'We decided to keep hold of him, but he has the option to leave after this season.' Depay and PSV colleague Georginio Wijnaldum are expected to attract a number of high-profile suitors, with the latter being eyed up by Paris Saint-Germain. 'I think these two players are very attractive to a lot of clubs in Europe,' Gerbrands continued. 'So far, no-one has come forward with an offer but I expect we will come under great pressure.' Depay (left) celebrates with international team-mate Arjen Robben during Holland's game with Chile in 2014 . Depay turned down a move to Tottenham last summer, but could leave for England in the next window . Depay is familiar with current Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal due to their time spent together with Holland, and reports in the summer stated that the player's decision to stay with PSV was heavily influenced by Van Gaal. Therefore, Depay's decision on which club to choose if he does leave PSV may be swayed by Van Gaal and Manchester United, who also have Depay's international team-mate Daley Blind in their ranks. The forward has scored 21 goals in 31 appearances in all competitions this season.","Memphis Depay has attracted interest from Man United and Tottenham .

"Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht teenagers Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker. Tielemans, 17, has been watched by Manchester United and Arsenal also and is a centre midfielder of some promise. He became the youngest Belgian player to play in the UEFA Champions League, making his Champions League debut at the age of 16 years, four months and 25 days in 2013. Chelsea are keen on signing Anderlecht teenager Youri Tielemans (pictured on the left) Leander Dendoncker is also said to be on Chelsea's radar after impressing for Anderlecht in recent weeks . Dendoncker, 19, is a more defensive player and can operate in midfield or at centre back. He scored Anderlecht's second goal in a feisty 2-0 win over Kortrijk on Sunday which saw both sides reduced to 10 men while Tielemans was one of four players booked. Belgium newspaper HLN reported that Chelsea scout Tony White was in the crowd to watch the game. Meanwhile, Chelsea have extended contracts for 18-year-old Belgian Charly Musonda Jnr to 2019 and his elder brother Tika Musonda until 2016.","Chelsea are monitoring the progress of the two teenagers .

"It's not time to play the music. For Lewis Hamilton has said the building of his ‘brand’ after Formula One — possibly in a recording studio — must not cloud his determination to win a third world championship. Hamilton has been a regular at showbusiness events in the close season, but now his red private jet has touched down in Melbourne and his focus has switched to the defence of his title in the opening race of the campaign. Nonetheless, his life is something of a juggling act. Yes, winning races is by far the most important thing, yet he has engaged transatlantic PR and talent agencies to polish his image after a split from Simon Fuller, who shaped ‘Brand Beckham’. Lewis Hamilton wants to replicate the scenes that followed after his second world championship title . Hamilton (left) has been pictured alongside Kanye West and Kim Kardashian since his triumph . Hamilton is adamant his growing profile will not distract him from matters on the racing track . Hamilton has never hidden his passion for music, posting Instagram snaps playing guitar . Is that ‘brand’ something Hamilton wants to replicate? ‘At the moment, it’s winning championships that counts,’ he said. ‘I don’t wish to stop racing but I’m conscious I’m halfway through my career, or maybe gone past halfway, and that the next six, seven or however many years I get will come and go. Whatever steps I take now will determine what I do after. ‘I don’t want to be a commentator, although I think I’d be OK at it because I obviously know a lot about the sport, but there are other things I would like to try. So it’s exploring those and building a foundation.’ Does that mean music? ‘I’m continuing to plod along and enjoy my music when I get time,’ said Hamilton. ‘But I haven’t been in the studio since January, and just for a couple of days. That’s the least music I’ve done during a winter for some time. ‘Music is more of my life than people are aware of. When you’re doing music you have a choice of how much you want to show and how vulnerable you want to be. I approach it just as a hobby, something I enjoy. It’s therapeutic. ‘I like to have feedback from people who are experienced. I’ve never been tempted to release anything but I’ve not had the worst of comments about my songs, either.’ Hamilton has spoken about several post-career avenues, including an acting role in Hollywood. He rules out very little. Hamilton admits that he wants to explore his creative side when he is away from Formula One . Hamilton (right) presented an honour at the Brit awards alongside Ellie Goulding . Hamilton described his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg as 'an honourable, respectful man' ‘Growing up, I was restricted in knowing, learning and being made aware of my creative side,’ he said of a young lifetime spent going from kart track to kart track under the eyes of his controlling father, Anthony, and the strict discipline of McLaren. ‘There are things I’m really quite creative at, so I’m going to see where that takes me. I am good at designing. I did my whole house. I have done my steering wheel for some time. I might indulge in trying to design clothes or something. Just do my own stuff. I’d like to do something with cars.’ Which brings us from hobbies back to business and a year in which Hamilton’s Mercedes team will again dominate, according to the crushing figures from pre-season testing. That sets up a private duel: Hamilton versus Nico Rosberg, the sequel. Their relationship became rancorous last season but ended with a hug in Abu Dhabi. It was a magnanimous gesture from the vanquished Rosberg. ‘An honourable, respectful man,’ was Hamilton’s verdict at Mercedes’ factory in Brackley last week. ‘My relationship with Nico is as good as 12 months ago,’ he added. ‘It seems quite good, to be honest. But it’s when you get in the heat of the moment and there’s... you know, you have to assume there’s going to be moments where there’s going to be bits of tension, but that’s because we’re fierce competitors. Hamilton insisted he is unfazed by Rosberg's efforts to beat him in the upcoming season . Hamilton is confident that he will be able to defend his title in the season that starts in Melbourne . ‘You are conflicted because you are trying to get the team to win, but you also want to win yourself. We managed it well, particularly at the end of last season.’ Rosberg, whose wife Vivian is expecting their first baby in August (classic German efficiency — a birth in the sport’s summer break, as one of his lieutenants observed), has said publicly he can win the title. Hamilton is unfazed. ‘You have to assume each driver is going to get better,’ he said. ‘I’m sure Nico is training harder. I’m sure he is studying more and trying everything under the sun to make sure he finishes ahead of me. That’s what I’ve been facing since I was 10 so it’s no different, really.’","Lewis Hamilton admits he likes to explore his creative talents away from F1 .

"Manchester United's attacking woes have been highlighted once more as it has emerged that Tottenham striker Harry Kane has scored more goals than Louis van Gaal's entire attack this season. Kane has scored 26 goals in all competitions during the course of the current campaign. The Tottenham star has netted 16 Barclays Premier League goals thus far. Manchester United's attacking trio of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao have amassed 25 goals in all competitions during the same period.

Rooney, who has been deployed in a midfield role in recent months, put his recent goal-scoring issues behind him to fire United into the lead in the 29th minute. But former United striker Danny Welbeck came back to haunt his old employers with the winner on the hour mark.

"South Africa's Trevor Fisher Jnr maintained the 100 per cent record of home players in the Africa Open by winning his first European Tour title with a brilliant display in East London. Fisher Jnr played his last 36 holes in 17 under par, adding a closing 64 to his third round of 63 to finish 24 under par, five shots ahead of England's Matt Ford. South African players have won the Africa Open every year since its inception in 2010, when Fisher Jnr was joint fourth behind former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel. Fellow major winner Louis Oosthuizen won the title in 2011 and 2012, with Darren Fichardt and Thomas Aiken also triumphing on home soil. South Africa's Trevor Fisher Jnr maintained the 100 per cent record of home players in the Africa Open . Fisher celebrates victory with his caddie on the 18th green during the final round of the Africa Open . 'It's amazing,' said Fisher Jnr, who had won eight times on the Sunshine Tour. 'I can't believe it. It's been a long time coming. I've been a pro for a long time. 'I played well. It's always a bit nervewracking leading, you always try not to think about the result but I think I did a good job today of staying in the moment. I was nervous the last few holes but I think that's natural. It was a great day, I played well, everything worked out well and the putter was amazing. Fisher  tees off on the first hole during the final round of the Africa Open at East London Golf Club . Fisher won the tournament finishing five shots ahead of England's Matt Ford at the Africa Open, South Africa . 'I think it's written in the stars; if you can get out of your own way you can achieve a lot of things. Everyone has to keep trying and keep working.' Fisher Jnr took a two-shot lead into the final round and birdied four of his first seven holes, but a bogey on the fifth meant that four birdies in the same stretch from Ford ensured the gap was cut in half. The decisive moment came on the ninth as Fisher Jnr made birdie and Ford missed a short putt for par, and the world number 271 secured victory in style with four birdies on the back nine - including one from 35 feet on the 18th. Ford plays his second shot into the 11th green during the final round of the Africa Open . 'I made birdie on 16 and knew I had a five-shot lead and it would have been very naughty of me to lose that lead,' Fisher Jnr added at the presentation ceremony. 'Matt's a little British bulldog. He just sank putts and I thought 'Jeez I'm not going to get away from this guy'. He made birdie, I made birdie so it was quite tough and then on nine I made a great birdie and he made a five and that was where it turned around for me and I knew I just had to keep my head up and keep going. 'It's really been tough, I've gone to many tour schools and it's such a tough week. If you don't play well that week you don't get your card. It's amazing - everything worked out well this week, the putts fell and I'm very grateful.'","Trevor Fisher Jnr won his first European Tour title in the Africa Open .

"Micro-pigs assuming the identities of race horses have been pitted against each other to help predict the winners of the Cheltenham feature races. Named after the horses they represent, the micro-pigs taking part in the Champion Hurdle include Hurricane Sty (Hurricane Fly), Fuzzheen (Faugheen) and Kitten Trot (Kitten Rock). The micro-pigs also dress in accordance with their counterpart and compete against each other on a specially designed miniature course. The brainchild of Coral bookmakers, the micro-competition is part of their CheltenHAM festival where horse racing fans are able to compete for free bets. And the footage, while not entirely insightful, is interesting to say the least. Opening on an establishing shot of the course, the micro-pig commentator stands before a microphone in a flat cap and welcomes the crowd – who wear Ladies Day hats. The micro-pigs each wear the colours of their counterpart horse and are paraded in the paddock before the start of the race . The commentator then takes the action down to the paddocks and begins introducing the race’s competitors. First up is Un de Sow (Un De Sceaux), who is presented as a pig with a weight problem. Next is Piglet Bay (Purple Bay), who struts around the paddock, before Kitten Trot is introduced and relieves itself. After a quick look to see ‘what the market is saying’ the race gets under way and despite Un de Sow, who makes a quick run for it, the other pigs just stand around and graze. A micro-pig commentator dressed in a flat cap introduces the competitors and comments on the crowd . Approaching the first bend Kitten Trot is able to take the lead however and makes its way over the famous hill first. As the race reaches its finish, the micro-pigs – except one who stops for a drink – manage to catch up with one another and run in a herd. And it’s almost too close to call as they reach the finishing line before Kitten Trot makes a last-ditch dash for it and wins. A member of the crowd wears a Ladies Day-style hat while watching the micro-pig race . The micro-pig called Kitten Trot makes its way over the famous hill and is the eventual winner of the race . While not an exact science, considering that Faugheen was the winner of the actual Champion Hurdle race, the competition is certainly a bit of fun. Tania Seif, Head of Social Marketing at Coral, said: ‘Move over Paul the octopus, there’s a new breed of animal psychic in town – the micro-pig. ‘We can’t wait to see if any of our micro-pig races successfully predict the winner of the actual races at the Cheltenham festival – we’re hoping they bring home the bacon for our punters.’ Towards the end of the race the competitors are much closer together as they make their way to the finishing line .","The micro-pigs are named after and dress as their race horse counterparts .

"Brendon de Jonge held the halfway lead at the Valspar Championship as gusting winds made scoring difficult on day two in Florida. The Zimbabwean recorded four birdies and two bogeys in a steady 69 to finish six under and open up a one-shot lead over a group of five players including Jordan Spieth, who fired the joint lowest round of the day with a 67. Kevin Streelman, Derek Ernst, Ryan Moore and Henrik Stenson were also on five under, Ernst having got to eight under at one point with a run of five birdies before dropping three shots in his final five holes. Brendon de Jonge posted a solid round of 69 to take the lead on the second day at the Valspar Championship . De Jonge began on the 10th and dropped a shot on the par-five 14th where he had holed from 126-yards for eagle on Thursday, before a birdie on 18 saw him turn level. Another birdie followed on the first before a bogey on the sixth and two further birdies on the seventh and ninth, with De Jonge admitting the wind was making life difficult. 'It's tricky out there,' he told www.pgatour.com. 'It's one of those golf courses where it's tough enough to get it on the fairway when it's still and when the wind blows it's added difficulty. 'It's difficult to pick it out there. It gets in these tress and swirls around so you've got to try and stay patient as best you can.' Spieth registered seven birdies and three bogeys on his way round, while Stenson opened with an eagle but could not maintain his momentum as he signed for a 70. Jordan Spieth shot the lowest round of the day, a 67, in difficult conditions, to sit in joint second place . Ian Poulter was then in the group at four under alongside Ricky Barnes, Lucas Glover and Sean O'Hair. Poulter started on the back nine and got himself to six under at the turn with birdies on 12,14 and 18 before back-to-back bogeys at five and six saw him slip back into the pack. But the Englishman is feeling confident for the weekend and believes the layout at Copperhead suits his game. 'Solid play,' he told Sky Sports 4. 'This golf course is a good golf course for me - it's short, it's tricky. It's not about hitting driver off every tee - it's about positional play.' He added: 'It's about putting it in to play to set up your second shot. The greens are small but undulating. 'The wind has now picked up and that's playing tricky and I've done a good job putting it in play and giving myself plenty of chances.' Ian Poulter was reasonably pleased with his performance which saw him two off the lead after two rounds . Another Englishman who is feeling better about his game is Luke Donald after shooting a 68 on Friday which left him two under. The former world number one has seen his form desert him in the past couple of years and his last PGA Tour win came here in 2012 but, after finishing in a tie for seventh at the Honda Classic, he feels he is getting closer to his best. 'It's been a while,' he said. 'I had a chance at Honda a couple of weeks ago. I need to keep giving myself chances and keep putting myself back into contention again. 'I think once I keep doing that and getting the juices flowing and feeling it again then hopefully the results will come.' Adam Scott splashes out of a bunker on a day which saw him lose his tour-long streak of 45 cuts made . Jonathan Byrd recorded a two-bounce ace on the 15th but could not make the cut while Justin Rose, Jamie Donaldson and Padraig Harrington were also among those returning home for the weekend. Adam Scott also missed out - ending the longest active cut streak on PGA Tour. The Australian had gone 45 consecutive PGA Tour events - and 57 tournaments worldwide - without missing a cut.","Brendon de Jonge shoots 69 to take outright lead on six under par .

"Jordan Henderson has insisted the vast majority of England youngsters will want to play in the European Under-21 championship this summer – but that pressure from club managers can make it difficult. Henderson says that his time with the Under-21 was a huge learning curve, even though when he played in Under-21 Euro 2013 as captain, England lost all three games in a deeply disappointing tournament. Henderson also played in the 2011 European Under 21 championship, in which England also failed to win. England midfielder Jordan Henderson played in Under-21 Euro 2013 as captain . But with a club versus country row already developing over the availability of Harry Kane this summer, Henderson has urged the current generation to take their chance to play if they can . Henderson said: ‘I would tell any of those young lads to go out there and play in tournament football for their country at any level. ‘I thought I gained a lot of experience doing that. It wasn’t all good as I had two Under-21 tournaments and we didn’t do that well in either. We could have done a lot better with the team we had – but I learnt a lot from playing in those games. Club versus country row already developing over the availability of Harry Kane . ‘There was never any doubt for me. All I wanted to do was go and play. Obviously people get injuries, which you can't help, but if you're fit, I wanted to go. You've got to manage it with the club managers, who think about the best interest of the player. And you've got to understand that. But for me personally I want to play every game for club and country and if I'm fit I'll want to play at a tournament whatever the level. Henderson says that most of the players do want to play – but that pressure from clubs is the reason why sometimes are withdrawn from age-group squads. ‘I'm not sure it's players needing convincing,’ said Henderson. ‘If you asked all the lads they'd want to play. But managers of clubs have to manage the player the best they can and their best interest is the player. ‘If they feel the player is playing a lot of games and are afraid they'll burn out, that's an issue. But for me I just wanted to play as much football as I could, whenever for, and though the tournaments didn't turn out how we wanted, I gained a lot of experience.’","Club managers could make it difficult for young players this summer .

"Veteran Harlequin Nick Easter is a man on a mission for the remainder of this season, hell-bent on proving his critics wrong by claiming the most unlikely of spots in Stuart Lancaster's England World Cup squad. A combination of impressive form for Quins, coupled with an untimely injury for Gloucester No 8 Ben Morgan, saw Easter recalled for this season's Six Nations after more than three years in the international wilderness. The 36-year-old's last international start came in the defeat by France in the quarter-finals of the 2011 World Cup, and he was subsequently omitted from the England set-up once Lancaster became coach in early 2012. Nick Easter poses with James Haskell and Lawrence Dallaglio at the Six Nations . But his ability to cover at No 8 as well as in the second row saw him feature as a replacement for England against Wales, Italy, Ireland and France in this year's Six Nations, with the veteran even winning his 50th international cap in the loss in Dublin. Easter's return to England colours has been seen by most as simply short-term option as the likes of Morgan and Wasp Joe Launchbury battle their way back to full fitness. But Easter sees his international return very differently and is determined to force his way into Lancaster's World Cup thinking as he looks to make his mark in the final weeks of the season. 'It's going to be tough making the World Cup squad with Ben Morgan coming back to full fitness,' said Easter, speaking at the Rosslyn Park HSBC National Schools Sevens. Easter looks dejected at the end of the Six Nations match between England and France . 'But I back myself to make it and I just hope I get a chance in the final World Cup warm-ups. 'Then the coaches have to make the decision from there about whether to select me or not but I back myself to make it. 'Our chances for the World Cup are as good as they were before. We have always had the players, it is just making sure we turn up for the big games and apply it. 'I would not mind becoming the oldest scorer for England at the World Cup – it would be a really nice thing to add to my career and I'm now so desperate to get the opportunity – I will be doing everything I can to impress and earn selection.' England came within six points of winning the Six Nations title this season after dismantling France at Twickenham on the final weekend of the Championship, with only an Ireland hammering of Scotland meaning Easter is not adding yet more silverware to an already impressive CV. Easter is 36 but hopes to win a place in Stuart Lancaster's England squad . A host of England players sparkled during the tournament, namely Jonathan Joseph and Ben Youngs, but it was the performances of Saracen Billy Vunipola at the base of the scrum that caught Easter's eye. In previous campaigns, Vunipola's fitness and inability to last 80 minutes had been called into question by Lancaster and his England coaching staff. But despite the form of Vunipola hampering his international chances, Easter is convinced the England youngster is now the real deal on the international stage. 'Billy Vunipola has had a very good tournament,' added Easter. 'He has got back to what he does best which is being a wrecking-ball for us, which is generally the job of a No.8 but he has got more to come from his game I think which can only be exciting for English rugby. 'He has got a big England future ahead of him. You look at last year and he was playing around 50 minutes and then being subbed but now this year he's managed to play five 80 minute games in a row so he is always developing. 'I'm still gutted about the end to the Six Nations; I feel the same as I did after the game. We had chances to win it and unfortunately we just came up short – that's the overriding feeling amongst the players. 'But there were so many positive as well to take from the tournament; namely the form, fitness and performances of Billy Vunipola – there are things to build on for us.'

"England's David Horsey and Scotland's Craig Lee are part of a six-way tie for the lead after the third round of the Tshwane Open in South Africa. Lee carded a four-under-par 66, the joint lowest round of the day, to set the clubhouse target on nine under par and looked on as none of the later starters were able to overhaul him at Pretoria Country Club. Horsey held the outright lead after three birdies and one bogey in his first 12 holes, but bogeyed the 17th to card a second consecutive 69, while overnight leader Adrian Otaegui struggled to a 72.

Otaegui, who is a protege of former Masters champion and 2012 Ryder Cup captain Jose Maria Olazabal, was two shots clear after a second round of 62 but dropped his first shot on the front nine all week when he bogeyed the third. The 22-year-old responded with birdies from close range on the sixth and eighth and looked in position to pick up another shot on the par-five ninth when his second shot bounded through the green, only to duff two chips and eventually card a bogey six.

"The RFU's chief executive, Ian Ritchie, has ignited a storm of debate in this country and attracted global attention — for saying England's inability to win the RBS Six Nations is 'unacceptable'. After a fourth consecutive second place in the championship, the man in charge of the union — and national coach Stuart Lancaster's boss — delivered a forthright verdict about the need to aim higher. Among those objecting to his views was Sir Clive Woodward, who argued passionately in these pages that the timing was wrong and that Ritchie had scored a 'massive own goal'. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie (right) chats to Lancaster at England's base in Pennyhill Park in Bagshot . Tom Wood (left), Courtney Lawes and Chris Robsaw leave the pitch following their 55-35 win against France . England have claimed just one Six Nations title since their 2003 World Cup triumph in Australia . Yet what was he supposed to say in the circumstances? Let's be clear; this was a damned-either-way scenario. Imagine if Ritchie had declared that he found the outcome — another campaign without silverware — to be perfectly acceptable. He would have been widely castigated for failing to drive standards, for setting the bar too low. He would have been condemned for sitting on the fence and refusing to demand better. Instead, he made it plain that he and the RFU are not about to settle for title near-misses. If it was meant as a suited boot to the behinds of the coaching staff, then it was unnecessary as they know precisely what is required. When Lancaster sat down to reflect on Saturday's 55-35 rout of France at Twickenham, he wore a despondent look. There was barely a flicker of consolation in the match result. He is well aware that anything other than first won't do. Lancaster (second left) consoles his players  after they fell just six points short of a Six Nations title . Amid a raging discussion on this polarising subject on Wednesday, some observers even questioned Ritchie's right to dip a toe in these waters at all. The thrust of the point from the dissenting voices was that he is in charge of the business and should leave Lancaster and Co to run the England team. This simplistic outlook ignores the glaring truth: that Ritchie controls the appointment of coaches. Soon after taking up his post he was the man who — following consultation with a panel of rugby experts — opted to give Lancaster the head coach role on a full-time basis, after his impressive interim audition. Earlier this season, Ritchie authorised the agreement of new six-year contracts for Lancaster and his three assistants, Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt. So while he may not have the deep-rooted rugby knowledge to precisely criticise performances, he is an employer who must monitor the efforts of his leading employees. He is only one administrative step removed from the running of the team. Ritchie (left) and Lancaster talk in the Twickenham stands prior to England's clash with New Zealand . In the rush to hand out bouquets or throw stones at the end of this year's home World Cup, Ritchie will be either acclaimed or damned by association with the England team as the man on whose watch the whole countdown and campaign took place. Should his young coaching team and their squad fall short of the country's expectations, the chief executive's head will be above the parapet, so it is only right that he can voice his hopes and fears from time to time. That matter of expectation is significant. Ritchie doesn't need reminding that the RFU are the richest union in the world and England have the greatest depths of playing reserves. With that in mind, to have won just one Six Nations title since the World Cup triumph of 2003 is absolutely unacceptable. Thus, what he said amounts to fair comment. Stuart Lancaster with his tight-knit coaching team of Graham Rowntree (left), Mike Catt and Andy Farrell . Among the Celtic nations in particular, the reaction to his post-championship verdict has led to yet more predictable and tedious references to perceived English 'arrogance'. This accusation is utter nonsense. It is entirely logical that a country — or a club, for that matter — with vast resources would have higher expectations and demands than those with less clout in terms of finance or personnel. Look at football's Premier League. The likes of Chelsea and Manchester City would aim for the title and consider anything else to be a let-down. It does not mean they have a divine right to win it, but their benchmark naturally must be higher than rivals with fewer resources. Ireland, meanwhile, are heading to the World Cup with back-to-back Six Nations titles . So it is not arrogance for the English to bemoan a paucity of championship successes. Consider this. In 2012, Scottish Rugby chief executive Mark Dodson outlined a strategic plan which included the target of winning a Grand Slam by 2016 — and also the World Cup. At the time, he said: 'The goals we've set reflect our ambition for the game in Scotland. With unity, and support from the whole nation there is no reason we can't achieve those goals.' The truth is somewhat different, but no-one dismissed this as Scottish arrogance, just wishful thinking. Ritchie is not guilty of arrogance for demanding that England win trophies. He is also not venturing outside his remit. He is aiming high, as is his right.","RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie branded England's second-placed Six Nations finish as 'unacceptable'

"A chip-in on his final hole handed Brian Davis a one-shot lead after the opening round of the Valspar Championship in Florida. The Englishman recorded eight birdies and two bogeys in an opening 65 to sit six under, a shot clear of American pair Sean O'Hair and Ricky Barnes. Starting on the back nine, Davis birdied 11,12, 14, 15 and 18 to turn in 30 and two further birdies on five and six had him out in the lead on his own. Brian Davis leads the Valspar Championship in Florida after an opening round including eight birdies . Bogeys on the seventh and eighth followed to stall his momentum somewhat but a wedge from the greenside rough at nine saw him take top spot. 'I actually hit a really good tee shot and a really good second shot, I was surprised to see it there,' he told Sky Sports 4. 'Obviously it's into the green so I can be aggressive but it actually jumps out a bit quicker than I thought and obviously (I am) delighted it hit the pin and dropped in. 'Delighted with the round, I hit some really good shots today.' Davis has won 12.8million dollars in his PGA Tour career but has yet to win a tournament and hopes improved iron play may at last push him over the edge after hitting 15 greens in regulation on the Copperhead course. 'My stats probably show I'm hitting eight to 10 greens a round, which is not going to get it done,' he added. 'If you start hitting 14 greens the way I putt, you're going to shoot under par and that's what I did today.' Davis hopes that his improved form will lead to a first tournament win of his PGA Tour career . O'Hair had eight birdies and three bogeys in his 66 while Barnes recorded a single dropped shot on 17 to slip into a share of second. There was then a group of six players on four under made up of Justin Thomas, Derek Ernst, Nicholas Thompson, Brendon de Jonge, Alex Cejka and Henrik Stenson. World number three Stenson is the highest ranked player in the field with Rory McIlroy and Bubba Watson not present and his 67 was bogey free. The Swede, starting on 10, had chances for birdie on his opening five holes but could only take advantage on 11, 13 and 14 before picking up a shot on nine. And Stenson hopes this week will provide him with some good practice for the Masters in four weeks' time. Henrik Stenson, the top-ranked player in the tournament, is two shots back after a first round of 67 . 'I come in here trying to prepare for Augusta as well and this is a great test for that,' he told www.pgatour.com. 'To just keep hitting your spots and stay patient and I did that all day and I got rewarded for it. 'I'm going to try the same for the next three days and, of course, try and hit the shots. Even though my swing wasn't on today I still picked my targets and tried the best I could. 'I hit some good shots, obviously, and the other ones I missed in the right places which is key here.'

Madsen, who was third at the Africa Open last week, said: 'The last couple of weeks I've been hitting some shots really close and I actually said to my caddy last week that a hole-in-one is on the cards pretty soon. 'Luckily for me it came today. I hit a fantastic shot, I couldn't hit it better, and it spun back into the hole.

"Champions Exeter survived a strong second-half fightback by Leicester to book their place in the LV= Cup final against Saracens next Sunday. Exeter, who beat Northampton in last year's final, will meet Sarries at Franklin's Gardens after a 30-22 victory over the Tigers at Welford Road. The visitors led 20-16 at half-time thanks to tries by Elvis Taione and Fetu'u Vainikolo, with Michele Rizzo replying for Leicester. Exeter Chiefs celebrates their opening try from Elvis Taione beneath a pile of Leicester forwards . Leicester fly-half Tommy Bell, who kicked 17 points, put Leicester within one point in the second half with a penalty and a drop goal but Greg Bateman clinched Exeter's victory with a try in the 75th minute. Fly-half Ceri Sweeney kicked 15 points for Exeter, who had Max Bodilly yellow carded in the 62nd minute. Prop Rizzo opened the scoring for the Tigers with a fabulously worked try in the fifth minute after a searing break from his own half by winger Miles Benjamin. Fetu'u Vainikolo coasts away for the Chiefs second five-pointer of the first half as they took a 20-16 lead . Benjamin drew the last defender before finding impressive young centre George Catchpole and, after a ruck in the Exeter 22, Rizzo blasted over from short range with fly-half Bell adding the conversion. Exeter were level 10 minutes later when hooker Taione got the touchdown after a driving maul from a line-out and Sweeney kicked the conversion. Bell restored Leicester's lead with the first of three penalties, this one from half way, but Exeter kept their noses in front for the rest of the half after they were handed a second try on a plate in the 20th minute. Try-scorer Vainikolo tackles Tigers winger Miles Benjamin at a muddy Welford Road on Sunday . Leicester looked set to counter from their own 10-metre line but number eight Laurence Pearce's pass was easily intercepted by winger Vainikolo, who ran in under the posts unopposed, with Sweeney adding the conversion. Sweeney kicked two penalties with a minute of the half left to give his side a small four-point cushion which became seven two minutes after the break thanks to another Sweeney penalty. Bell missed a long range penalty before finding the posts with a drop goal after Leicester failed to score from a line-out and drive. Tigers scrum half David Mele spins the ball right from the ruck as they fall short in the LV= Cup semi-final . Bell put Leicester one point behind with his fourth penalty after Exeter full-back Bodilly had been sin-binned in the 62nd minute for a professional foul after a great break by Tigers lock Brad Thorn. Leicester, who made several key changes on the hour, might have scored moments later after Benjamin's break put replacement hooker Neil Briggs clear but he was collared just short by flanker Ben White. Replacement Bateman sealed victory for Exeter, only their second at Welford, with a try from a line-out and drive in the 75th minute with Sweeney converting.","Exeter meet Sarries at Franklin's Gardens next Sunday in LV= Cup final .

"England's Ross Fisher faces a completely different challenge as he looks to successfully defend a European Tour title for the first time in his career in this week's Tshwane Open. Fisher ended a four-year victory drought with his win 12 months ago at The Els Club at Copperleaf, which, at 7,964 yards, was the longest course in European Tour history. This year the tournament, which is the sixth and final event co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour this season, has been switched to Pretoria Country Club, which measures 7,063 yards and has had the par-five fourth and 18th holes reduced to par fours, making it a par 70. Ross Fisher says it will be tough for him at the Tshwane Open this year but that he is looking forward to it . The Englishman plays a shot during a practice round at the Pretoria Country Club . Fisher poses with the trophy last year . 'It's a lot shorter and a lot more fiddly,' said Fisher of the course, which was redesigned in 2004 by Gary Player, who calls it a 'hidden gem'. 'There will be a lot of positional play off the tee, a lot of irons and not many drivers. 'It's an adaptation that we have to make as players. We don't generally play these types of golf courses. 'It's very different and I would prefer to be on a long golf course that's quite tight, because driving is my strength. 'It's going to be different this week. Your wedges will have to be sharp and you're going to have to get a hot putter, because I can imagine the scoring will be pretty good with some quality players here this week. 'I'm looking forward to the challenge and hopefully the game can live up to that.' Compatriot Andy Sullivan missed the cut in the Africa Open last week but is looking for his third win in South Africa in the space of 10 weeks, while home favourite George Coetzee has the benefit of local knowledge. Pretoria native Coetzee has been a member of the club since he took up the sport and won his first tournament here at the age of 10. 'I didn't build my game at this golf course,' Coetzee said. 'I putted well to shoot good scores here, but it's a drawer's golf course. There is a lot of risk and reward and on a lot of holes you can take it on. 'There are some advantages to knowing the course as well as I do, but it suits a certain type of golfer. Hopefully I make enough putts to make up for that. Andy Sullivan is looking for his third win in South Africa in the space of 10 weeks . 'I guess there's probably a little bit of extra pressure but hopefully I will thrive on it this week. 'I've got a couple of tricks that I know the course likes to throw at you and hopefully I'll use them to my advantage.' Compatriot Trevor Fisher Jnr comes into the event on the back of winning his first European Tour title at East London last week, a win which proved highly popular. 'It's been overwhelming,' Fisher Jnr said. 'All the messages and support, it's something special. I'm still busy soaking it in and looking forward to this week as well.'","Ross Fisher looking to successfully defend European title for first time .

Boro's first two goals came from set plays, and the Spaniard added: 'We've been working on our set-pieces this week and it was brilliant how the first two goals came from them.

I threw strikers on, we were all over the place and a bit of a shambles at the end. We're organised at corners normally and shouldn't concede. 'It looked a bit shambolic at the end as we pushed forward and I'll take responsibility for that.

"Spain's Adrian Otaegui will take a two-shot lead into the third round of the Tshwane Open after threatening to record the first ever 59 on the European Tour on Friday. Nine birdies in the first 16 holes at Pretoria Country Club, including five in a row from the eighth, left Otaegui needing two more to break the magical 60 barrier. However, the 22-year-old former British Boys champion narrowly failed to chip in from the edge of the green on the 17th and then dropped his only shot of the day on the last after finding a bunker off the tee. Adrian Otaegui made an impressive nine birdies in his round of 62, and came close to going under 60 . The resulting 62 gave the world number 403 a halfway total of 11 under par, two shots ahead of South Africa's Merrick Bremner, who birdied four of his last six holes to add a 66 to his opening 65. Bremner's compatriots Keith Horne and Trevor Fisher Jnr, who won the Africa Open on Sunday, were a shot further back on eight under alongside England's David Horsey and Italy's Edoardo Molinari. Otaegui, who is mentored by former Ryder Cup captain Jose Maria Olazabal having played most of his junior golf at the latter's home club in Fuenterrabia, said: 'I was focused and didn't know that I had made five birdies in a row. It was an excellent round from the Spaniard, who leads in Pretoria after two rounds . 'I was playing well and made a few putts, that's all I was thinking about. The best golf is when you think as little as possible, and this was one of those days. 'We were first to tee off this morning, conditions were perfect, the greens were perfect. I like playing this early so I really played well, made many birdies and am happy with my round.' Horsey added a second round of 69 to his flawless opening 63, but joint overnight leader Morten Orum Madsen - who had finished his opening round with a hole-in-one on the eighth and eagle on the ninth - took five more shots to play those holes on Friday as he struggled to a 72 to lie five under. David Horsey, who made a brilliant 63 on the first day, is four shots behind after a second round 69 . 'I gave a few silly ones away and missed it on the wrong side occasionally as well,' Horsey said. 'It's a little bit disappointing I suppose but I still managed to make my fair share of birdies to keep it under par. 'I am three behind but there is a long way to go and this golf course can yield a lot of birdies as well as bogeys. I am in a nice position; I would have taken that if you had given me it on Wednesday.' Home favourite and club member George Coetzee is four off the lead after a 66, with defending champion Ross Fisher three shots further back following a 67. European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke chipped in on the ninth for an eagle and repeated the trick on the 10th for a birdie, but also had two double bogeys in a 67 which left him on two under.

"Jose Mourinho has given his players permission to let their hair down following Wednesday night's clash against West Ham. Off the back of Sunday's euphoric Capital One Cup Final win over Tottenham, the Blues are straight back into action against the Hammers on Wednesday.

'They will have Thursday and Friday off, and I told them those are the best moments if they want to do something that people at their age sometimes like to do.

Asked if captain John Terry will sort out new contract terms before the end of the season, Mourinho was certain in his response but admitted he is thinking ahead to life after the 34-year-old. 'Yes, it will be [extended] before the end of the season for sure. What I can guarantee is he will be a Chelsea player next season. I can guarantee that. 'Every one of these big guys is difficult to replace, but at the same time you still have the player and he is still an important player, you have to start thinking: 'What next?

'[West Ham] have in their hands different ways of playing football, different ways of seeing the game, and with a very good coach like Sam, it's always difficult to play there.' 'I don't play the same team. I don't play the same 11 players, that's for sure. [Zouma] is not a midfield player. He is not going to be a midfielder. That is completely clear. 'We didn't have Matic and Mikel in a final where it was important to keep the balance of the team. We needed someone to do that job.

"An American saga of redemption and recovery unfolded in dramatic style at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Sunday. Wearing red was JB Holmes, who has recovered so hearteningly from two bouts of gruelling brain surgery four years ago. Wearing blue was Dustin Johnson, the party boy who took a six-month leave of absence to mend his wild ways. In the end it was the man hell-bent on his redemptive mission who came out on top as Johnson closed with a final round 69 to win by one from Holmes, who had begun the final round with a five shot lead. Dustin Johnson (right) celebrates with his caddie Austin Johnson on the eighteenth hole at Doral . Johnson proudly holds the WGC-Cadillac Championship trophy following his victory on Sunday . 'It means everything to win again,' said Johnson, who admitted his break was due to issues with alcohol and was competing in just his fifth event on his return. 'It has been a tough road but a lot of good has come out of it and I feel great now. This has to be the best win of my career.' Johnson has long had a reputation as one of America's most gifted talents but was in danger of throwing it all away. Now he looks a reformed character. The latest world rankings out on Monday are likely to show him up to 6th and he' s quite capable of giving Rory McIlroy a run for his money at the top. Masters champion Bubba Watson led briefly but paid for a bad stretch of three bogeys in four holes from the 11th and finished third. Johnson went the other way, playing his last 11 holes so artfully that he completed the sequence in a telling three under par. It was hard not to feel sorry for Holmes. He had opened the tournament with a 62 that was so good it might well stand as the round of the year. But he blew his chances with a terrible start that saw his five shot lead dwindle to nothing before the first 90 minutes of play was completed. Johnson celebrates his birdie on the 15th hole during the final round of action on Sunday . As for McIlroy, his troubles with the plethora of water hazards continued right to the end, as he put not only his drive on the 18th into the water, but his third shot as well. Before the start of his final round, Donald Trump, preposterous owner of this overrated venue, had presented McIlroy with the three iron he had tossed infamously into the water on Friday, after it was retrieved by a scuba diver. McIlroy took it out of his bag once on Sunday - to play that third shot at the last. Thanks a lot, Donald, he must have been thinking. McIlroy shaped up to throw the offending implement into the water once more, but this time kept hold of it. It was a moment of light relief at the end of a seriously trying week for the world number one. Bubba Watson led briefly but paid for a bad stretch of three bogeys in four holes from the 11th . At least he finished off with a more typical example of his artistry. Through the back of the green and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple bogey seven or still worse, McIlroy chipped the ball in for a six. Even so, it rather undid the good work he displayed earlier, and meant he signed for a 71. He still finished in the top ten, though. All those missed putts and shots into the water, and still only a handful of players beat him. 'It was certainly an adventurous week and the game's just not quite there,' he admitted. 'I'm pretty disappointed with the way I played overall. But there were signs of improvement.' He will look to build on those during a two day trip to Augusta National, beginning on Monday. He will play just one more tournament – the Arnold Palmer Invitational next week – before his historic tilt at a career grand slam at the Masters next month. Rory McIlroy plays a shot on the second hold during a disappointing final day of action for the world No 1 . Round of the day came from England's Danny Willett, who shot 68 to finish tied 12th. This was a fine confidence boost for the 27-year-old Yorkshireman ahead of his first appearance at The Masters. 'I'm obviously very pleased,' he said. 'It's a tough course and the set-up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week, I'd have bitten your hand off if you'd offered me that on Thursday. When you're playing with the top 50 you know they're not going to give you anything, but I'm feeling more comfortable all the time playing at this level.' How far can he go? One area of concern remains a chronic back injury that has caused him to withdraw from plenty of tournaments over the years and one this year already. 'I'm taking painkillers and managing it,' he said. 'I'm going to stay over here through the Masters because flying back and forth is no good for it. There's no point worrying about it, I've just got to get on with it.' He is doing that all right.","Dustin Johnson closed with a final round 69 to claim the title .

"Following Rory McIlroy's WGC-Cadillac Championship meltdown - where his 3-iron ended up in a lake - a scuba diver took the plunge to retrieve the Nike Vapor club. The unidentified man was spotted by TV cameras entering the water before triumphantly lifting the iron out of the murky water.

There was a split second like should I or shouldn't I, but I didn't need a 3-iron for the rest of the round so I thought, why not? It felt good at the time. 'Looking back at it, it isn't one of my proudest moments. But, you know, walked away with a bogey and regrouped and did okay from then.'

"It rather summed up a week when he made headlines for all the wrong reasons that Rory McIlroy should find the water twice on the 18th hole at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Sunday. On American television over the weekend it was impossible to escape footage of him tossing his three iron into the water on Friday. Before the start of play, Donald Trump, preposterous owner of this overrated venue, had presented McIlroy with the said club, after it was retrieved by a scuba diver. How typical of Trump that he plans to have the club mounted in the hotel, thereby glorifying an action that would have every regular golfer drummed out of their club if they tried it. Rory McIlroy hits a shot from the ninth fairway during the final roudn att the WGC-Cadillac Championship . McIlroy's round was shaping up nicely before his unfortunate finish on the 18th hole . The World No 1 tries to play his way out of trouble during a disappointing final round at Doral . McIlroy himself is keen to put the incident behind him and did his best with a round that was shaping up nicely until an unfortunate finish. He stood on the 18th tee tied for sixth but put his drive into the water on this brutal hole and then, after adding a penalty shot, his third shot as well. At least he didn’t lose his sense of humour. He feigned to throw another club in the drink, but this time held on to it. Through the back of the green in five, McIlroy was facing a difficult chip down the slope and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple or worse. Typical Rory. He chipped it in to the end the tournament with a more characteristic demonstration of his usual swagger. The resultant double bogey meant he signed for a 71. He still finished in the top 10, though. All those missed putts, shots and water adventures therefore, and still only a handful of players beat him. Among the leaders, it was hard not to feel sorry for American JB Holmes. He began with a five-stroke lead but got his choke in early. Bubba Watson plays a shot out of a bunker on the 11th hole at Trump National Doral Blue Monster Course . There was a seven-shot swing in the first seven holes between him and Bubba Watson, leaving the Masters champion with a two-shot advantage. Watson, however, then dropped a couple of shots himself. With eight holes to play there was a three-way tie for the lead involving these two and fellow big hitter Dustin Johnson. One of the best rounds came from England’s Danny Willett, who shot 68. The 27-year-old, early leader of the Race to Dubai, is getting more comfortable at this rarefied level, and this was a fine confidence boost ahead of his first appearance at The Masters next month. The resultant top-15 finish boosted his world ranking and, as a member of the top 50, assured him of a first appearance in a regular PGA Tour event at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in 10 days. He will also play the Houston Open before Augusta. Dustin Johnson winds up a shot on the 10th hole during a strong final round for the American . ‘I’m obviously very pleased,’ he said. ‘It’s a tough course and the set-up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week, I’d have bitten your hand off if you’d offered me that on Thursday.

"England boss Roy Hodgson has criticised Tottenham, claiming they should not be taking Harry Kane on a 21,000-mile post-season trek to Australia if they think he needs a rest. Kane gushed with pride on Thursday after being rewarded for his fine form with a maiden England call-up. The 21-year-old is in line to make his international debut against Lithuania on March 27 or in Italy four days later. Harry Kane has been called into the England squad for the first time by Roy Hodgson . Kane is set to play for the Under 21 side in summer . 'It is an honour to be called up to the senior side, something I always dreamed of as a kid,' Kane told Spurs TV. 'I'm excited, when I got the message I was going to be in I was full of joy and hopefully it is the first of many.' Having started the season as Spurs' third-choice striker, few expected Kane to score 26 goals for the club. But now he is the club's poster boy and, for that reason, the north Londoners are determined to take him on their post-season jaunt to Australia, where they will play Sydney FC in a friendly on May 30. Hodgson is not so keen on the idea, however. Kane will, more than likely, be included in the England Under-21 squad for the European Championship - which takes place from June 17 to June 30 - as Hodgson wants him to experience international tournament football. Gareth Southgate's team will play at least one friendly between the end of the season (May 24) and the start of the tournament on June 17. Hodgson has noted Mauricio Pochettino's concerns about Kane's potential tiredness, but he thinks Spurs have a perfect opportunity to rest the striker by leaving him out of the squad for the 42-hour round trip to Australia. 'This is a marketing game as far as I can understand,' the England manager said. 'Personally speaking, playing for England at Under-21 level at a tournament is more important than a friendly in Australia. 'I would be very hypocritical if I didn't give that answer. 'If he needs a rest, there's a great opportunity when the season ends before our Under-21s get together to give him a rest. 'You can't expect me in good faith to say: 'oh no, I understand he shouldn't be resting for the Australia trip, he should be doing that and then resting when the Under-21s pitch up.' I can't go along with that.' Having represented Spurs across four competitions, Kane could amass well over 50 appearances for the club before the end of the season. And the Argentinian expects the forward to push himself to the extreme to impress Hodgson. Pochettino will relay his concerns to Hodgson when England train at the club's Enfield base next week in the build-up to the two internationals. 'I will see Mauricio,' Hodgson said. 'I don't think it's a problem there. Don't forget these decisions are sometimes commercial and taken out of a coach's hands.' Mauricio Pochettino will take his Tottenham side to Australia at the end of the season .","Harry Kane was called up to the England squad for the first time .

"Rory McIlroy posing topless as Michelangelo’s statue of David. It’s not an image you’d naturally conjure of the world No 1, but it is a remarkably striking one. And thank goodness for the kilt... The picture – which has been described as both “genius” and “weird” by various Twitter judges – appears on the front cover of Golf Digest’s latest issue. The prestigious magazine describes McIlroy as ‘the new model for greatness’. The Northern Irishman is gearing up for his latest crack at winning the Masters, which tees off in on April 9. A win on Augusta National’s hallowed fairways would ensure McIlroy’s third major in succession and a career Grand Slam. Only Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods hold that most prestigious honour of winning all four majors. Rory McIlroy poses as Michelangelo's David on the front cover of Golf Digest's latest issue . How Michelangelo's masterpiece looks in comparison with McIlroy on the golf course . McIlroy revealed to the magazine some of the secrets behind his stunning success in 2014, during which he won The Open and US PGA Championship and played a pivotal role in Europe’s Ryder Cup success at Gleneagles – usurping Woods as the sport’s current superstar. The 25-year-old’s new dedication to the gym, a focus on perfecting his craft following his break-up with Caroline Wozniacki and a deliberate steeling of a gentle soul are the key factors McIlroy offers as to his recent dominanace. ‘After [the break-up], I thought “What else do I have in my life. I have family and friends, but they're always going to be there. What else?” That's when I decided “You know what, I'm just going to immerse myself in golf for a while.” I spent more time at it, thought about it more, spent more time at the range and at the gym. Because that's all I had, and that's all I wanted to do,"" he told Golf Digest. The Ulsterman believes his brilliant form last year was due in part to his new fitness regime . McIlroy also reveals how he changed his mindset after breaking up with Caroline Wozniacki . 'I've come across enough successful people now to know that the best in whatever walk of life, they're the ones who just work the hardest. I realised that if I want to be the best and fulfill my potential, I'm going to have to do the same thing.' McIlroy talks about how his swing has improved thanks to his new fitness regime strengthening the “big muscles” in his core. His gruelling 90-minute gym sessions are taken 10 times a week under the gaze of fitness instructor Steve McGregor. The Holywood-born star also offers a fascinating insight into his psyche, revealing that he felt for a long time that being a winner was a selfish trait and an unnatural one for his character. McIlroy is preparing to return to Augusta National for another crack at the Masters . McIlroy holds both the Open and US PGA titles . ""Until just a few years ago, I don't want to say I felt guilty for being successful because I had this ability given to me, but it was sort of like, “Why me?”. ""Because I felt like it's a very selfish thing to be a winner, a very selfish trait. Which is what you sort of need in golf. And I guess it just took me a while to be comfortable with that, just because of the personality I have. I realized that if I want to succeed in golf, which I do, I need to have it. What helped was realizing how much people like winners, how people gravitate to them. So if other people are happy for me winning, then why can I not be?"" McIlroy insists that now “I want to win at golf all the time... I feel like I've developed a bit of a ruthless streak on the golf course”. But he admits that he tends to be “too nice” and will deliberately lose a game of cards or pool “just to keep (his opponent) happy."" It is 10 years since Woods won his fourth and most recent Masters, and a McIlroy victory at Augusta National would herald a new era in golf. Woods can seemingly not stay fit for long enough to compete against McIlroy, and the pair have become friends off the course – an unlikely scenario were Woods still at his ultra-competitive peak. McIlroy offers another insight into the relationship between the two greatest golfers of their generation, saying ""He wants to help (me). He's like “'I know you're getting into the same sort of position as me, so anything you need to know, we've been through it all.””","Rory McIlroy has been pictured in stunning pose for magazine cover .

'I am devastated,' Robshaw told several national newspapers. 'Once again to fall short on points is tough to take. We went out and gave it our all but unfortunately came up short again.'

Bernard Le Roux is tackled by Luther Burrell during the RBS Six Nations match between England and France . Jules Plisson, Robshaw, Loann Goujon and Luther Burrell all challenge for the ball at Twickenham . The back-rower was at pains to point out that it was not the failure to get the 26-point victory they needed against France that was the most costly factor in their doomed bid for the northern hemisphere crown. 'It didn't come down to this game,' he added. 'If we'd been more clinical and taken more points against Scotland and been better defensively against Italy it would have been different. 'We are not where we want to be. We want to be champions. But to score 50 points against France, considering they had only conceded two tries all tournament, was a great scoreline and really showed our intent.' Billy Vunipola is tackled by the French defence during the RBS Six Nations match at Twickenham Stadium . Courtney Lawes is helped up by Benjamin Kayser at the end of the RBS Six Nations match . With England the host nation at this autumn's tussle for the Webb Ellis Cup, the Twickenham support could make a huge difference to their bid and Robshaw was quick to praise the fans for their efforts at the weekend. 'I think it was the loudest I have ever heard Twickenham - the place was rocking and that is what we want,' he said. 'We are playing very well at home and have built a lot of momentum now and if you look at where our World Cup games are, they are back here.'","England finished second for the fourth year in a row despite France win .

"Liverpool have opened talks with Joe Allen over a new signing a new deal. The Wales midfielder, who is recovering from a slight hip problem, has just over two years left on his current terms but he is a player whom Brendan Rodgers wants to keep for the long-term. Allen was one of Rodgers' first signings when he became Liverpool manager in 2012, having previously been a key figure for him at Swansea, and he has continued to fill an important role at Anfield. Joe Allen is set to be offered a new long-term contract by Liverpool, with two years left on his current deal . Brendan Rodgers will be pleased to be extending the stay of a player that he brought with him from Swansea . He has 24 appearances so far this season for Rodgers' top-four chasing side and returns to his former club this weekend as Liverpool look to keep up their good form against Swansea. He missed Liverpool's 0-0 draw with Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup on Sunday with a minor hip strain but is expected to return for the trip to the Liberty Stadium.

"Luis Figo and Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein of Jordan, two of the four challengers for the FIFA presidency, have quickly supported the joint BBC and Sky initiative of a live TV debate. Figo, a former world footballer of the year, said: ‘The fans deserve to know what the candidates offer for the future.’ But the project is doomed because Sepp Blatter’s reply, after he returns from a trip to Paraguay this week, will be to turn down the request. Luis Figo backed BBC and Sky's initiative of a live TV debate for the FIFA presidential candidates . FIFA president Sepp Blatter, speaking to the media after the International Football Association Board (IFAB) meeting in Belfast last week, is likely to turn down the joint BBC and Sky initiative . The FA want to send two Great Britain football teams to compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics but a row has broken out with other home nations even before the qualification process starts. FA technical director Dan Ashworth and England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate want young England players to gain tournament experience. Their view has the backing of chairman Greg Dyke, leading to the FA changing their mind about sending only a women’s side — if any — to Brazil. The FA’s departing general secretary Alex Horne wrote to the other three countries on his last day in office at Wembley informing them that it was now their intention to enter both Olympic football competitions. FA chairman Greg Dyke has backed the idea of sending both a men's and women's team to Rio . England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate wants young England players to gain tournament experience . However, the manner of the FA taking the lead on raising the teams infuriated Wales, especially, and Northern Ireland, leading to a stormy meeting between officials at the IFAB summit in Belfast last Friday. Scotland were less concerned because of their long, unequivocal opposition to the GB football format, which they see as a threat to their independence within FIFA. The main sensitivity with the Welsh and the Irish was why the FA had the divine right to be the national association with the football seat on the British Olympic Association since its inception in 1905. Wales are also upset about the FA reneging — owing to a rules change — on a gentlemen’s agreement over the rotation of the British vice-president seat on FIFA executive committee. FA technical director Dan Ashworth, pictured talking to Roy Hodgson, shares the views of the Under 21 boss . Former Manchester united midfielder Ryan Giggs captained Team GB at the 2012 Olympics . The rumpus has led to FIFA telling the FA to sort out the internal fighting before submitting their GB football applications. The men’s side would need to reach the last four of the European Under 21 Championship this summer to qualify . The Olympic issue has raised extra emotions because it follows all the fuss around the home nations providing players at London 2012 for a Team GB side that the BOA mandated England to select. A BOA spokesperson said: ‘We have received confirmation from the FA of their intention to enter into the qualification process for Rio for both men’s and women’s tournaments.’ Craig Bellamy celebrates scoring against Senegal at Old Trafford during the 2012 Olympics . FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke claimed at the IFAB summit in Belfast that FIFA had heard nothing from the Dutch FA ahead of that meeting about a proposal for a video assistant to aid the referee. The FA had strongly supported the plan for the technology to be trialled in the Dutch Cup, but that was rejected by the FIFA representatives on IFAB. Now it has emerged that the Dutch FA had asked ‘several times’ to present to FIFA, without success. To add to the conspiracy, Dutch FA president Michael van Praag is standing for the FIFA presidency and a green light for the technology test would have given him added kudos in the build-up to the May election.

"Ronald Koeman takes on Jose Mourinho this weekend well aware of how desperate his old friend will be to put Chelsea's Champions League disappointment behind them. Southampton face the unenviable task of trying to stifle a Blues side not only chasing the Premier League crown but wounded by Wednesday's European exit to Paris St Germain. Chelsea failed to capitalise Zlatan Ibrahimovic's first-half sending off, with the 2-2 extra-time draw at Stamford Bridge ending their hopes of a memorable treble.

Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as he prepares to send off Ibrahimovic in the first-half . It was not the first underwhelming  Blues performance of late, but Koeman does not expect such displays to necessarily work in Saints' favour this weekend. 'I don't know when it's a good time to face them,' the Dutchman said. 'It's always a difficult time. 'It's a big team, a strong team with some great players and of course they are very disappointed after the last Wednesday result. 'If you play 60 minutes against 10 players, you don't expect that final result and maybe a little bit more under pressure. 'They fight after the League Cup title and after that, not the most important one, they fight for the title. 'They need a win after a disappointing result but they will give a reaction you normally expect as a manager.' Ahead of this match, Mourinho brashly declared that Chelsea would win the Premier League - the kind of comments Koeman takes with a pinch of salt. The pair worked together under Louis van Gaal at Barcelona in the late 1990s and retain a close relationship to this day. 'I know him very well,' Koeman said. 'It's a good friend and great coach and a very successful manager. 'It was nice in our period in Barcelona and it's always nice to meet Jose and we look forward. 'When I was with Jose the assistant of Van Gaal in Barcelona in '98 and '99, it was a long time ago and it's not always easy to know what will happen in the future. 'At that time he was very ambitious as a coach and he had good coaches to see what he needs to be a successful coach.'

'We did some activities which was great, some players were skeptical before going but everybody was happy with what we did. 'It was a good week but playing football is totally different.

"Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel enters the new Formula One season in the unusual position of being the outsider. This time, the Ferrari driver is doing the chasing - behind the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. Vettel used to be the man to beat, winning the title four years in a row with Red Bull. But Mercedes ended that dominance in crushing style last year and Vettel - who seemed isolated and despondent throughout the season - made the switch to Ferrari. 'The change felt right for me and it gives me a lot of joy,' Vettel said. 'My ambition is to be right there at the top again, not only for me but also in terms of the team. In this respect, we should make a perfect fit.' Sebastian Vettel enters the new Formula One season in the unusual position of being the outsider . The Ferrari driver is doing the chasing behind the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg . The German also gets the chance to emulate his childhood idol, seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who won the vast majority of his titles and his 91 GPs with Ferrari. The 27-year-old Vettel, who has 39 GP wins and 45 pole positions, clearly needed to get away from Red Bull. Vettel finished a dismal fifth in the drivers' standings, with no wins and just four podium places. The gap between him and Hamilton was a mammoth 217 points. Worse still, he was usurped by his junior team-mate, Daniel Ricciardo, who finished third and won three races. The timing seemed just right for Ferrari, too, which needed a change following two seasons of tensions with Fernando Alonso. Pre-season testing has been like a fresh start. Vettel takes part in pre-season testing at Circuit de Barcelona Catalunya in his new car last month . Vettel joined Ferrari in the off-season after many successful years at Red Bull . Vettel drives behind Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg during testing in Catalonia earlier this month . 'I feel very well. The tests so far have contributed a lot to that feeling,' Vettel said. 'Of course things take time, as growing into a team that works a bit differently requires that.' The positive tone was set at the first testing session in Jerez, with Vettel and teammate Kimi Raikkonen claiming the fastest time on three of the four test days as Ferrari announced its comeback in style. Overall, a reinvigorated Vettel completed more than 600 laps over the three winter testing sessions and Ferrari showed glimpses that it can challenge Mercedes for speed. Over the 12 days of testing, Ferrari completed 1,182 laps - the fourth most mileage of any team - and the second most by power unit behind Mercedes. 'The path to the very top right now still leads via Mercedes and it is our aim not only to draw level with them but to surpass them,' Vettel said. 'That is a very ambitious goal.'

"The ladies who lunch at the Ascot Bar of the Pennyhill Park Hotel were oblivious that one of the most decorated English footballers had just strolled in. At 6ft 4in, Chelsea and England centre-back Gary Cahill ought to be hard to miss, especially when he is the national team’s vice-captain, having picked up pretty much every club honour in the game. Win the Premier League in May and he will have the full set - following Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup success in little more than three years. Yet he goes relatively unnoticed while the likes of John Terry, or his old Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard, both with similar achievements to their name, would be stopped in their tracks. Gary Cahill went relatively unnoticed during an interview with the Mail on Sunday at the Pennyhill Park hotel . Chelsea defender Cahill has picked up nearly every club honour in the game, including the Champions League . ‘If you’d said to me four or five years ago I would be in this position I’d have snapped your hands off,’ says Cahill, 29. ‘It’s an amazing feeling. I often think about how lucky I am and how so many people would love to be in this position.’ Since arriving at Stamford Bridge from Bolton in January 2012, the medals and trophies have simply kept on coming. ‘Moving to Chelsea has been such a success in terms of the titles I have won in three years,’ he says. ‘The winning mentality of the club rubs off on the players and you just want to win even more.’ Cahill poses with the Champions League trophy and the FA Cup after Chelsea completed the double in 2012 . The former Bolton and Aston Villa centre back holds aloft the Europa League trophy in Amsterdam a year later . A week ago, Cahill added a Capital One Cup winner’s medal as Chelsea clinched the first major silverware of season in a 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Wembley. ‘It was almost like the lads were bouncing into training the following day,’ he recalls. ‘Winning anything is special to [Jose] Mourinho. It’s his first trophy since he returned. ‘There was very little celebration considering we had just won a competition. My family had come down from the north to watch the game and they all stayed at my house. There’s no better feeling than driving home from Wembley to my family at home.’ Cahill added the Capital One Cup trophy to his haul last week as Chelsea defeated Tottenham 2-0 at Wembley . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is all smiles as he and his team celebrate after landing their latest silverware . Cahill (centre) appears highly amused as Mourinho throws himself to the floor during the celebrations . But with the Champions League and Barclays Premier League high on Chelsea’s agenda, it is ‘back to business’ as Cahill says. Mourinho keeps stoking up the warrior-like instincts in his team and Cahill believes that, aside from the manager’s meticulous pre-match planning, two key elements are contributing to the team’s success this season. ‘We’ve learned from our experiences,’ he says. ‘We played several teams last season where people expected us to get results but we didn’t. Having that in the back of your mind going into the season has helped, you don’t want to go through that again — you don’t want to waste opportunities.’ The second key factor is the quality of signings who joined the club in the past two transfer windows — including Cesc Fabregas and one of the best strikers in Europe, Diego Costa. Cahill says Chelsea learnt from setbacks last season and insists the club do not want to waste opportunities . Diego Costa arrived at Chelsea from Atletico Madrid and is one of the Premier League's most-feared strikers . Former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, signed from Barcelona, has formed a connection with Costa . ‘Diego has come in and although he hardly speaks any English, had never played in this league before and has never lived in this country, he had an impact from the word go. ‘Time and again players come over and take a long time to settle down and get into the groove of the Premier League but it hasn’t fazed him. He’s one of the liveliest jokers in the changing room. He’s certainly entertaining and he has settled into the group really well. ‘With Cesc, everyone knew his quality and he has played in this League before so in a way it was easy for him to come back. But still, he has come into the side like he has never been away and the connection Costa and Fabregas have had this season has been fantastic for us. ‘There’s also the likes of Filipe Luis, who has come in and done tremendously well. There’s a real fight on at left-back. It’s one of those positions where we’re blessed. You know whoever plays is going to do the job. ‘Kurt Zouma is another great talent, he listens to everybody and he takes on advice. He’s a nice lad and a fantastic player. Playing at a club like Chelsea and being given the opportunity to play with the world-class players that we have means you can learn from them and improve your game.’ Chelsea centre backs Gary Cahill, captain John Terry and  Kurt Zouma celebrate together at Wembley . Cahill had to take some flak after Tottenham’s Harry Kane inspired a 5-3 win over Chelsea on New Year’s Day, but he takes such criticism as ‘part and parcel of the game,’ and points out that ‘there isn’t a footballer on the planet who hasn’t received negative press’ at some stage in their career. ‘You need to have a thick skin at times, especially at the highest level. I am constantly analysing my performances and I tend to focus more on things I haven’t done as well as I’d have liked. I always look to improve and that’s what’s got me to where I am today.’ Cahill’s greatest day in Chelsea colours came in the Champions League victory over Bayern Munich in 2012. Now he is playing his part in their bid to repeat the feat, and his magnificently timed flick, from a Terry cross, led to Branislav Ivanovic’s header putting Chelsea in front against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the first leg of their last 16 tie last month. Branislav Ivanovic celebrates after scoring for Chelsea against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League . Cahill's flick from Terry's cross at the Parc des Princes led to Ivanovic's important goal in the French capital . ‘It was a crazy situation because we found all three of us in the box and nobody else,’ recalls Cahill. ‘JT played it to me and I knew Ivanovic was coming in behind me. I couldn’t score from that angle so I tried to help it on and he did the rest.’ On Wednesday, Chelsea host PSG in the return leg, with the tie 1-1, and it’s a mouthwatering challenge. ‘It’s got that final-feel about it because if you lose the game you’re out — and you have to really push hard to win the game. The atmosphere on European nights is something special and that’s another positive with the second leg being played at home, the fans are our 12th man. Have we got the squad and the players to win it again? Yes we have.’","Gary Cahill has won Champions League and Europa League with Chelsea .

"Diego Costa's desire to win is so great that even in a simple training game the fiery striker will play on the edge, according to former team-mate Toby Alderweireld. Spain international Costa came to England with a reputation as a bullish centre forward and, as plenty of Premier League defenders will attest to, the Chelsea hitman has more than lived up to the billing. Alderweireld, on loan at Southampton, spent last season playing with the Brazil-born striker at Atletico Madrid as Diego Simeone's side claimed a famous La Liga title. Diego Costa has been involved in numerous scuffles with defenders during the season, including a running battle with PSG defender David Luiz in Wednesday's Champions League clash . Toby Alderweireld is likely to be tasked with stopping Diego Costa at Stamford Bridge on Sunday . Costa and Alderweireld played together at Atletico Madrid together during title winning season last year . The duo will be re-united at Stamford bridge on Sunday with Southampton still in the hunt for a top-four spot, while Chelsea will be hoping to return to winning ways after they were dumped out of the Champions League midweek by PSG. Alderweireld knows better than most what Costa is like to line up against having faced him in training and the defender is not expecting an easy ride on Sunday. 'That's his mentality,' the Belgium international told The Sun. 'Outside the field he's totally different, he's a very nice guy, good to the supporters, never in a fight, always laughing. Spain international Costa argues with PSG midfielder Thiago Motta as Thiago Silva pushes him away . Alderweireld celebrates victory against Hull with fellow teammates Jose Fonte and Morgan Schneiderlin . 'It's strange to see him change on the field, because of his desire to win. 'Even on the training pitch, just in an easy game, four against four, he's always on the line, and his desire is so big that sometimes he goes over it. 'It happened a lot at Atletico because the training was so crazy.'","Chelsea welcome Southampton to Stamford Bridge on Sunday .

"Liverpool defender Kolo Toure admits he has a difficult decision to make about his future. The Ivory Coast international's current deal expires this summer and while there have been talks over extending his stay, nothing has yet materialised. Toure, 34 later this month, remains hopeful an offer will be forthcoming but even if it is he has a tough choice to make as to whether to stay on in the knowledge he will only be a squad player or to make the most of his remaining time in the game by looking for regular football elsewhere. Defender Kolo Toure (left) is hoping a new contract offer to stay at Liverpool will be forthcoming . Toure (right)  hit the post with a header in the second half as Liverpool drew 0-0 with Blackburn on Sunday . Toure predicts that Emre Can will go on and become a 'king' at Anfield after his impressive displays . 'We are still talking to the club. We will see in a few days. The club have to think and I have to think,' he said. 'It is a big decision and that is why I need to think very hard and take a decision and stick with it. 'It is very important to know what you are facing. I need to do the right thing for me and my family.' Whether Toure ultimately stays on as a player at Liverpool or not he has predicted a brilliant future for his successor Emre Can, who he believes will become a 'king' at Anfield . Last week manager Brendan Rodgers claimed the Germany Under-21 international will develop into a world-class asset for the club and now Toure has echoed those sentiments. Can endured a difficult adaptation period following his £10million summer move from Bayer Leverkusen and a lengthy injury lay-of contributed to him featuring in just nine matches - most as substitute - up until Christmas. However, somewhat fortuitously he found himself thrown on as a third centre-back at Burnley on Boxing Day and has never looked back, starting every match since and often moving into midfield - his preferred position - to provide cover. His performances have led to some suggesting he has all the credentials to one day captain the side and Toure has no doubts about the 21-year-old's quality. 'He is a top player. He has been playing outstandingly at the back and in midfield he is a very strong player,' said the African Nations Cup winner. 'We like him here. He is from Germany and German players are good. They learn football and they are really intelligent, tactically outstanding and are really strong. Can has also received strong praise from his Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers (centre) Toure believes that his team-mate Can (right) has eladership qualities that could see him become captain . 'I am not surprised how he has been doing because he has been working hard at training and he is a top professional. 'He is young but really good. He is a leader. When you are on the pitch you can see by the way he plays he is really confident and he talks on the pitch as well. 'Right now Jordan Henderson is very good (as captain) but there is no doubt this boy is going to be a king here because he is a top player and can make a difference on games. 'He can score goals, his work-rate is amazing and there is no better player.'","Kolo Toure  hopeful he will offered a contract extension at Liverpool .

"Even Fernando Torres wasn’t relegated to the reserves. But for £250,000-per-week Radamel Falcao – perhaps the most handsomely-rewarded second-string striker in history – this was the ultimate indignity. Does he feel an injustice, angry with Louis van Gaal for such a degrading demotion? Or is there an acceptance that his powers have faded? In fact, they’ve gone out like a light. Radamal Falcao has scored just four goals since arriving at Manchester United . His latest run out was for the Under 21s as they faced Tottenham on Tuesday night . At least with fellow £50million flop Torres his decline was something of a slow burn, occasionally illuminated by a flicker of glories past. Sadly, for Falcao, there is no sign of him emerging from the darkness at Old Trafford. An unused substitute as Manchester United struggled for a goal (Falcao has scored more than 200 in his career) during their 2-1 defeat by Arsenal in Monday’s FA Cup quarter-final, the Colombian was back at the Theatre of Nightmares 24 hours later for an Under 21 fixture against Tottenham. He wasn’t there to cheer on the club’s next generation, he was lining up alongside them. United insist it was a fitness exercise. But fitness is allied to form, and Falcao certainly doesn't boast the latter right now. Falcao fluffed his lines and missed several chances during a win over QPR back in January . The striker has spent plenty of time warming the bench at Old Trafford . Louis van Gaal must decide whether to take up the option to buy Falcao at the end of his loan spell . He failed to score against Spurs, fluffed one chance and was then withdrawn – a synopsis which could well be applied to the majority of his outings since his £6m loan move from Monaco. The beauty of that arrangement – and it’s something of an ugly truth – is that United are not committed to making his stay permanent and there is zero chance of them doing so after his failure to impact, four goals from 19 appearances his sorry return. Compare that with the 70 strikes from 91 matches for Atletico Madrid and his demise is given some numerical context. Falcao drew a blank against League One Preston in the FA Cup last month . He also struggled against Cambridge from League Two in the previous round . Celebrations have been few and far between for Falcao, pictured here after scoring against Leicester . River Plate . 2005-06 - Games 11 Goals 7 . 2006-07 - Games 20 Goals 3 . 2007-08 Games 39 Goals 19 . 2008-09 Games 35 Goals 16 .

Monaco . 2013-14  Games 19 Goals 11 . 2014-15 Games 3 Goals 2 . Manchester United . 2014-15 Games 19 Goals 4 . It was, of course, in the colours of Atletico that Falcao smashed a devastating hat-trick past Chelsea in the European Super Cup of 2012. Every tribute in the wake of that demolition job determined that Falcao was ready-made for the Premier League – pace, power, potency, he had the lot. Even his pre-Madrid existence supported the assertion that he was the continent’s most feared goal-getter. There were 72 goals from just 87 games at Porto, winning with them a Portuguese title, cup and Europa League, a prize he defended the following season in Spain. His spells at Porto and Atletico were bookended by River Plate and Monaco, where again his ratio was as good as one-in-two. But it was that move to Monaco which proved fateful in the loss of Europe’s finest front man. With a transfer fee of £52m and salary of around £15m, there were obvious accusations – defended by Falcao – behind his motivation. However, it was the knee injury suffered in January of last year which robbed him of a place at the World Cup and, on the evidence of this season, a whole lot more than a mere ticket to Brazil. Falcao was on holiday during the World Cup as he missed out following a long injury lay-off . Falcao scored goals for fun during his days as an Atletico Madrid player . He won the Europa league with Porto in 2011 and again with Atletico the following year . Falcao is still a Monaco player having signed for Manchester United on a season-long loan . Gone are the razor-sharp reactions of body and mind. Gone is the swagger, the confidence, the belief that he is the best. Sound familiar? Over four, long years at Chelsea we witnessed the regression of Torres. In the end he left having scored just 20 league goals in 110 games. Falcao will be lucky if he leaves United with 20 league appearances, let alone goals. Torres, of course, now resides back at Atletico, his connection with the club affording him a second chance. At 29 and with his best days very much behind him, perhaps a similar fate awaits Falcao.","Radamel Falcao has scored four goals since arriving at Old Trafford .

"The legal battle between Sauber and Giedo van der Garde will continue on Thursday, just 27 hours before the start of first practice for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. Van der Garde was axed from his role as test driver at the end of last season as Sauber instead employed Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr, both of whom brought considerable sponsorship. Van der Garde, though, claimed to have proof he was offered a race seat for 2015 and so took his case initially to an arbitration panel in Switzerland which recently ordered Sauber 'to refrain from taking action' that would deny him a drive. Giedo van der Garde pictured outside the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne on Wednesday . There followed a hearing at the Supreme Court in Victoria, Australia, on Monday, with Mr Justice Croft announcing at 10am local time on Wednesday he found in favour of the 29-year-old Dutchman. Sauber immediately appealed, and by 3.15pm three different judges in Justices Simon Whelan, David Beach and Anne Ferguson heard the case. That lasted just 45 minutes, however, with the appeal to be reheard from 9.30am local time on Thursday, allowing them the opportunity to weigh up overnight the merits of the case. Notably there is the fact Ericsson and Nasr have contracts with the team for this year, and are expecting to be in the cockpit on Friday, with the first practice session due to commence at 12.30pm local time. Following the initial verdict, and prior to the appeal, team principal Monisha Kaltenborn was left stunned by the decision, but vowing to do what was right for her two current drivers. Van der Garde leaves the court after a judge ruled that Sauber must let the driver compete in Melbourne . Kaltenborn said: 'We are disappointed with this decision and now need to take time to understand what it means and the impact it will have on the start of our season. 'What we cannot do is jeopardise the safety of our team, or any other driver on the track, by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers.' By contrast, Van der Garde was naturally happy to have won the initial decision, although faces an anxious wait to see if it will be upheld on appeal. 'I'm looking forward to going back to the team and we'll work hard to do our best for this weekend,' he said. Van der Garde driving for Sauber at the Italian Grand Prix last September . 'I'm the fittest ever. I've been training the last three months flat out. 'I still have a very good relation with the team, and I'm looking forward to racing this weekend.' Asked as to the other drivers, he replied: 'It's up to them what they are going to do, and up to the team. It's not my thing. 'I'm happy we won the case. Now I'm looking forward to getting back to business.'","Sauber has appealed the Supreme Court of Victoria's ruling .

"Southampton fear they will miss out on a permanent move for on loan defender Toby Alderweireld with parent club Atletico Madrid intent on sparking a bidding war for the player. The Belgium international has impressed for the Saints this season prior to sustaining a hamstring injury at Manchester United in January. His performances have been central to Southampton's attempt to finish in the Premier League's top four, and manager Ronald Koeman wants to make the loan move permanent ahead of the next campaign. However, Alderweireld's form has not gone unnoticed elsewhere. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is understood to be an admirer of the 26-year-old, while Manchester City remain in the hunt for defensive reinforcements with Manuel Pellegrini yet to find the perfect partner for captain Vincent Kompany.

Both Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala have been given opportunities but have so far not done enough to convince anybody at the Etihad Stadium that they can help take City to the next level, particularly in Europe. Southampton have a £6.8million option on Alderweireld as part of their loan deal but it's thought Atletico may well use a clause in the deal that stipulates they can essentially pay £1.5m to cancel that and then sell the player to the highest bidder.

"Nico Rosberg must reinvent himself in order to challenge Lewis Hamilton for this year's Formula One championship, according to Damon Hill. Rosberg lost out to Hamilton at last season's title decider in Abu Dhabi, with the Briton storming to the chequered flag as his Mercedes team-mate encountered technical gremlins. It marked Hamilton's 11th victory of the campaign, six more than Rosberg. The Mercedes pair are set to go toe-to-toe for this year's championship once more, with the Brackley-based outfit appearing to boast the strongest package ahead of Sunday's curtain raiser in Melbourne. Nico Rosberg needs a reinvention if he is to challenge Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, says Damon Hill . Hamilton roared to championship victory in 2014 with 11 race victories to his rival team-mate's six . Hamilton (left) and Rosberg come together following their final race of a tumultuous season last year . Rosberg has a more subtle skill set than his formidable team-mate Hamilton, says Hill . And Hill, the 1996 world champion, believes Rosberg has to improve on his displays of last season to stand any chance of stopping Hamilton from claiming back-to-back titles. 'Nico has talents that are slightly more subtle and less obvious than Lewis, but I think he is going to have to invent a new Nico to counter his team-mate,' said Hill. 'If you look at the strike-rate of Lewis's wins in comparison to Nico, that was pretty formidable really. Does it change that much and can it change that much over the winter? 'It can, but politically now Nico had an opportunity last year to establish himself as the guy that the team wants to invest in, but Lewis really captured that with the biggest prize going. 'The championship was delivered by Lewis, so he is clearly someone, if Mercedes have to hedge one way or the other, then they will go for Lewis.' Hamilton will begin the new campaign as the favourite to claim his third championship. But does Hill believe there is any danger that the Briton, whose celebrity status outside Formula One continues to grow following a number of showbiz appearances during the off season, will take his eye off the ball? 'You never know with Lewis,' he admitted. 'He keeps us guessing and it would be easy to take some of the signals he puts out as being slightly distracted by other things.

He wanted to do this all of his life and I think now he has got the ball rolling he wants to win. He can see the prizes, he collects his trophies and is very proud of his success and he still talks as if he is stunned by his own success. He will be very difficult to beat this year.'

"Ronda Rousey showed why she is the finest female combat fighter in the world with her 14-second victory over Cat Zingano in Los Angeles. Here, Sportsmail looks back at the five fastest finishes in the UFC. 5=) Don Frye vs Thomas Ramirez - 8 seconds . Don Frye took part in an eight-man openweight tournament at UFC 8 in 1996 and this knockout came in the quarter final when he knocked Thomas Ramirez out cold with his right hand. Frye would go on to win the tournament but was the barred from his job as a fireman due to the controversy surrounding mixed martial arts at the time. Later in the year, he won the Ultimate Ultimate 96 tournament but then retired. Don Frye celebrates winning the 8-man tournament at UFC 8 which included his knockout of Thomas Ramirez . 5=) James Irvin vs Houston Alexander - 8 seconds . Not only was this a quick knockout, it was particularly brutal. James Irwin landed with a superman punch and Houston Alexander simply fell to the canvas. After a fight with Rashad Evans fell through, Irvin lost to future middleweight champion Anderson Silva and later tested positive for painkillers methadone and oxymorphone. James Irwin landed with a superman punch and Houston Alexander collapsed to the canvas . 5=) Makwan Amirkhani vs Andy Ogle - 8 secondsAs debuts go, Makwan Amirkhani's was one to remember. In January, he landed with a flying knee to leave Andy Ogle on the canvas and the referee stepped in after a final flurry of punches. Unsurprisingly, the Finn earned the Performance of the Night bonus for his efforts. Makwan Amirkhani enjoyed a stunning debut, landing with a flying knee before finishing Andy Ogle . 2=) Todd Duffee vs Tim Hague - 7 seconds . Everyone loves a heavyweight clash, and everyone loves a knockout, so Todd Duffee's seven-second KO of Tim Hague ticked all the boxes. It was a straight left that did the damage as Hague dropped the canvas before he was rescued by the referee. Ironically, Duffee was on the end of a similarly brutal knockout in his next fight against Mike Russow - but this one came after 12 minutes. He had two spells with the UFC and remains an active fighter with independent promotions. Heavyweight Todd Duffee lands several punches on Tim Hague before the referee stepped in . 2=) Ryan Jimmo vs Anthony Perosh - 7 seconds . Anthony Perosh had barely touched gloves before he was on his back from a devastating right hand from Ryan Jimmo and the referee did not need a second invitation to intervene. Jimmo has fought five times since but has failed to string two victories together. Ryan Jimmo's right hand did the damage as he sent Anthony Perosh crashing to the canvas . 2=) Chan Sung Jung vs Mark Hominick - 7 seconds . Chan Sung Jung - aka The Korean Zombie - had already won Submission of the Night on his UFC debut and added Knockout of the Night against Mark Hominick. Slipping a wild left hook from his opponent, Jung responded with a stiff right hand and a barrage of blows on the canvas. After a third victory in the promotion, against Dustin Poirier, Jung challenged Jose Aldo for the featherweight title, losing in the fourth round and dislocating shoulder. He is currently serving military service. Chan Sung Jung slipped a hook and then responded with a right hand that left Mark Hominick out cold . 1) Duane Ludwig vs Jonathan Goulet - 6 seconds . Officially, Duane Ludwig's one-punch knockout of Jonathan Goulet was recorded at 11 seconds by the timekeeper. It was only after he petitioned the UFC that Ludwig was awarded with the organisation's fastest finish. He said: 'The record is very cool to have, because it separates me from every other human being past, present and very possibly future. That's some pretty cool stuff. Each athlete wants to stand out and this is a very big way to do so.'

"Football supporters' chiefs have called for proportionality in punishments for fans convicted of offences during Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final clash between Aston Villa and West Brom. Home supporters twice invaded the pitch during their side's 2-0 victory over the Baggies at Villa Park, while seats were thrown from the upper tier of the stand holding visiting contingent on to the spectators below. West Brom boss Tony Pulis later voiced his support for lifetime bans for anyone convicted of throwing seats as both clubs vowed to take strong action against offenders, with West Midlands Police and the Football Association also launching investigations.

However, Malcolm Clarke, chair of the Football Supporters' Federation, urged the authorities to make the punishment fit the crime. Mr Clarke said: 'If people do something wrong, they must expect to be sanctioned. I think talk of lifetime bans is over the top, I'm afraid. 'Are we really saying that in 50 years' time, one of these young people - if it was young people - couldn't take their grandchildren to a football match? I don't think so. 'You have got to have punishments which are proportionate to the offence. The law at the moment has a maximum 10-year period for a football banning order, so it would be rather odd for people to start talking about lifetime bans. 'You could go to prison for a serious violent assault at a football match and the courts might give you a 10-year football banning order, so are we seriously saying that someone who damages a seat gets a lifetime ban?

The pitch invasions, one of which came shortly before the final whistle and the other after it, divided opinion with some onlookers claiming it represented little more than a collective outpouring of joy for the Villa supporters. And that is a view with which Clarke has some sympathy. He said: 'It's very important to retain a sense of perspective here. As far as I could see, this was a celebratory invasion not an aggressive one. 'There is a distinction between aggressive invasions, where people are trying to attack somebody else, and celebratory ones. 'We would certainly advise fans not to do that. It is a criminal offence so you always run the risk of ending up in court if you are not careful. It's not advisable, but actually it's not the biggest issue in the world, I would say about that one. 'If there was criminal damage to some seats, that's quite wrong and, again, anybody who is identified as being responsible for that must expect to receive some sanction.

'It's clearly not defensible to do that, but every Saturday night in pubs and clubs up and down the country people damage things. It's wrong and it's deplorable, but one incident at one football match when these kind of things happen very regularly in pubs and clubs on a Saturday night up and down the country gets blown up out of all proportion. 'Sometimes, people misbehave, at football matches, in pubs, in clubs, in the street or wherever, and that's deplorable. But let's not castigate football fans for just one incident. 'The actual incidence of disorder at football matches has hugely declined in recent years, so that's a cause for celebration.' Nevertheless, it proved a difficult weekend for Midlands football with police, who made 17 arrests, also investigating a disturbance at the Witton Arms pub before the Villa game, while a 44-year-old Watford fan is critically ill in hospital after being attacked on his way to the railway station following the Hornets' 2-2 Championship draw at Wolves. Clarke, who wished the unnamed man a full recovery, said: 'Whether they are a football fan or whether they are not, it's totally unacceptable to assault people to any extent, but particularly to that extent, so obviously if they are caught presumably they will be brought before the courts and the law will take its course, which is entirely appropriate. 'Football fans should never be above the law.' The pitch at Villa Park can barely be seen as supporters cover practically every blade of grass .

"Martin Brundle believes Lewis Hamilton will be classed alongside his boyhood hero Ayrton Senna in the pantheon of all-time Formula One greats should he claim his third world championship.

"Geraint Thomas has come out swinging in the wake of a report detailing that doping is still rife in the professional world of cycling, branding the findings as ‘insulting’. The Team Sky rider was reacting to claims made in the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report, which was published on Monday. In it one ‘respected cycling professional’ is said to believe that 90 per cent of the peloton are still benefiting from performance-enhancing drugs. Geraint Thomas has taken aim at CIRC's report into doping in elite cycling, branding the findings as insulting . The report alleges that the UCI acted favourably to Armstrong to protect the sport and that doping still takes place in the sport. However, unlike in Armstrong's days, its says riders now have a choice to dope or not . That, according to Thomas, is rubbish. ‘I think it’s a hell of a lot cleaner,’ he told the BBC. ‘I didn’t race back then, but some of the stories you hear… it’s certainly not like that now. ‘Whole teams were doing it back then. ‘It’s insulting when people say it [cycling] is really filthy and saying I’m doing something wrong.

"Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis has returned to training after collapsing at Tottenham on March 4. Gomis was kept in a London hospital overnight for observation after leaving the White Hart Lane pitch on a stretcher and wearing an oxygen mask after several minutes of treatment. The 12-times capped France international's collapse sparked memories of Fabrice Muamba's cardiac arrest at White Hart Lane while the midfielder was playing for Bolton in an FA Cup tie in March 2012, but it later emerged that Gomis suffers from a vasovagal condition. Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) walks to Swansea training flanked by Nathan Dyer and Jordi Amat . Gomis made a welcome return to Swansea following his worrying collapse at Spurs . The French striker was put through his paces as Swansea prepare for Liverpool's visit on Monday . Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham . Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness . The condition causes low blood pressure and Gomis had previously fainted on a number of occasions while playing in French football, something Swansea were aware of when they signed the 29-year-old from Lyon last summer. Swansea's players were given an extended six-day break following their 3-2 defeat at Tottenham and Gomis joined his team-mates on their return to training after making a short visit to France. 'Bafe is back in Swansea and trained today,' a club spokesman told Sportsmail on Wednesday. Players from both sides appeared shocked before referee Michael Oliver restarted the game . Gomis has a history of fainting, pictured here having a vagal attack during France training in 2009 . Gomis took to social media within hours of collapsing to alleviate concern about his well-being. 'I Wanted to reassure you concerning my Health, it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous and I am feeling well now,' Gomis posted via his Twitter account. 'I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father health that requires me to go back and forth to France. 'I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight but now everything is back In order. 'I also want to thank everyone for their support and get Well messages.' Gomis is expected to be given the all-clear for Swansea's Barclays Premier League home game with Liverpool on Monday evening. Gomis has only managed five goals in all competitions since his summer arrival from Lyon . On 17 March 2012, Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch at White Hart Lane during an FA Cup quarter-final match between Bolton and Tottenham. The former Trotters midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life-saving medical treatment from Spurs staff and consultant cardiologist Dr Andrew Deaner, who was at the game as a fan, from the pitch. Muamba was rushed to the nearby London Chest Hospital, accompanied by then manager Owen Coyle and striker Kevin Phillips, for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned. Medical staff rush to Fabrice Muamba's aid after the midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest in 2012 . Muamba's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former Birmingham player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance. Despite fears that he would not survive, the 26-year-old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on April 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football.","Swansea forward fainted on pitch in Premier League game against Spurs .

"A director of an online gambling firm linked to Harry Redknapp and two Premier League football clubs has been arrested over a £21m fraud probe, it has emerged. Paul Bell, a director of 666Bet, was reportedly arrested at Heathrow airport last week as part of a joint money-laundering investigation by HM Revenue & Customs and the National Crime Agency. Six other people were arrested, 13 properties were raided and £1m in cash was also seized as part of the investigation. A director of an online gambling firm, which signed Harry Redknapp to star in its adverts (pictured above) has been arrested over a £21m fraud . The online firm announced deals with West Bromwich Albion and Leicester City last summer. It also signed former QPR manager Redknapp to appear in its adverts, alongside Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels actor Vas Blackwood. Last week, the UK gambling regulator The Gambling Commission suspended the firm's licence. The suspension led to Football League One side Leyton Orient, which signed a contract with the bookmakers in August last year, terminating its deal for shirt sponsorship. It is not yet known whether the two Premier League clubs will follow suit. Speaking from Dubai, Mr Redknapp told the Independent on Sunday: 'I just did an advert for them. I don't know anything about it at all. Not a clue.' Mr Bell, a stockbroker who is now an investor, was reportedly arrested at Heathrow before being re-arrested the following day when he arrived on the Isle of Man by private jet.

"Paris Saint-Germain goalscorer David Luiz apologised for celebrating his goal against former club Chelsea as the English side exited the Champions League following a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea were eliminated as the tie went into extra-time as 10-man PSG twice came from behind to win an ill-tempered last-16 tie on away goals. The first leg was drawn 1-1 and Chelsea's advantage grew when Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off after 31 minutes. David Luiz celebrates wildly after sending the game into extra time with a bullet header at Stamford Bridge . The Brazilian defender couldn't hide his emotion, but later apologised for celebrating against his former team . Luiz said he was sorry that he had celebrated, but that he had been unable to control himself in the moment . Gary Cahill's strike nine minutes from the end of normal time was cancelled out by former Chelsea defender Luiz, but the hosts went ahead for a second time through an Eden Hazard penalty early in extra-time. PSG captain Thiago Silva, who conceded the spot-kick for handball, was denied from a corner by Thibaut Courtois but then netted with a header moments later to make it 2-2 on the night and send the visitors through. 'I think we played a great game,' Luiz told Sky Sports 5. 'When we lost Ibra, our best player, you say ""keep it simple"". Play the ball to feet and keep possession as we need to score to qualify. It was amazing tonight the spirit. Every single player gave everything. The powerful header took the game into an extra 30 minutes, in which Thiago Silva scored the crucial goal . Luiz sinks to his knees at the final whistle, celebrating the win for his new club against his old employers . 'I finished at Chelsea and then I got a great opportunity from PSG - they gave me a great opportunity to continue my career and I was very happy at Chelsea and won titles here but I finished and then I respect everyone. 'It was good for me to score. I said before I didn't celebrate but there as so much emotion I cannot control (it) and sorry because I celebrated because of the emotion but I am so happy to qualify.'

"Despite a promising league position and a place in the Champions League a real possibility, Manchester United appear to have had a solid season - but their misfiring strikers continue to be a hot topic. Louis van Gaal is coming under increasing scrutiny but the lack of goals being scored by his forwards is a worry - with talk of United deciding not to sign Radamel Falcao on a permanent transfer due to his less than impressive performances. Club legend Dwight Yorke formed a formidable partnership with Andy Cole during their years at the Red Devils and he feels that their current crop of creative players need to start providing the forwards with the same quality and style he had at Old Trafford. Dwight Yorke scored an impressive 48 goals in 96 games for Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson . Speaking to the Sunday Mirror he said: 'I'm sure it's only a matter of time before things click, but as strikers you also need the players behind you to make it happen. For me and (Andrew) Coley, we were blessed, as we had the likes of Beckham, Giggs and Scholes providing the ammunition. It was dead easy for us, we just had to put the ball in the net. They were magical times and we had many magical moments. 'Hopefully the same thing can happen again for this United side.' Andy Cole and Yorke were formidable but had David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs providing them . Wayne Rooney is the clubs current top-scorer with 11 goals in all competitions, with the England captain also being asked to drop into midfield in the past couple of months. With Robin van Persie recently suffering an injury, Yorke feels that Rooney and Radamel Falcao could be the pairing to set Old Trafford alight again. He said: 'United have world class strikers in the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao, but they don't seem to have found the ideal combination. Wayne Rooney is the clubs top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions despite playing recently in midfield . Radamel Falcao has failed to impress at United and was hauled off against Preston in the FA Cup . 'Rooney and Van Persie as a pairing hasn't really clicked, so maybe a Rooney-Falcao combo might provide the answer for United long-term.' The former Trinidad and Tobago international was also keen to pass on some words of wisdom to Van Gaal and the United players with a place at Wembley just one win away.

"The darkest hour for James McCarthy came at Christmas when he felt the familiar, sickening tear all footballers dread. As one of the most influential players in Everton’s squad, McCarthy was aiming to starting afresh in the New Year. December had been a write-off due to a hamstring problem but he had put the hard yards in to ensure 2015 began brightly. Then his world fell in. ‘It was so frustrating,’ said McCarthy. ‘You come back and then you break down. You come back again and then you break down again. The lowest moment was having done all the work and it happened again. Everton's influential midfielder James McCarthy suffered a frustrating injury setback at the turn of the year . McCarthy admits the lowest moment came was breaking down having worked so hard to regain his fitness . ‘I’d been delighted to get back. It was Christmas and I was looking to get going but then I played a couple of games over a few days (against Stoke and Newcastle) and it went. Mentally it was tough. It’s never nice sitting in the stands. You want to get out there and help. ‘We have changed a few things and the manager has looked into every detail, such as my training load. I’ve changed my boots, the inner soles of my shoes. They looked at my car but that was okay. I am just delighted to be back. Now it is about putting things right.’ There is an unmistakable sense that the Republic of Ireland midfielder is eager to make up for lost time. Everton’s season was ticking along nicely before he was injured in Wolfsburg in November. Since then, the collapse has been bewildering. How much has been down to his absence? He has missed 14 games so far and Everton have won just two; with him in the team the win percentage jumps from 14.3 to 36 and they are also more potent in front of goal. McCarthy is all smiles with Everton team-mate Seamus Coleman during training at Finch Farm on Wednesday . They will hope that proves to be the case on Thursday night in the Europa League last-16 clash at Goodison with Dynamo Kiev. Everton manager Roberto Martinez is at his most gushing when talking about McCarthy. He has been a huge influence, dating back to when he signed him for Wigan from Hamilton Academicals in June 2009, shortly after he was Scotland’s Young Player of the Year. Growing up in the Castlemilk area of Glasgow, McCarthy was a gifted footballer and both Reading and Liverpool wanted to sign him. ‘I didn’t want to be away from home when I was that age,’ McCarthy explains. ‘I was only 15. Liverpool and Reading both looked after me really well but I was happy to stay at Hamilton. I made the right decision. I wanted to play as many games as I could.’ Something with Martinez clicked when they met and the education he received in Wigan has accelerated his development. McCarthy and Everton take on Dynamo Kiev at Goodison Park on Thursday night in the Europa League . Martinez is under scrutiny, with some Evertonians having gone cold at his unrelentingly optimistic appraisals, but few are better placed than McCarthy to give an insight into what makes his manager tick. Is he too positive? ‘I don’t think so,’ McCarthy replies. ‘You need to be positive. If he was permanently negative, the club would be a depressing place to be. He has got the right attitude. I have worked with him for five, six seasons now and I know him down to a tee. Everton manager Roberto Martinez has been a huge influence on McCarthy having coached him at Wigan . ‘He is positive and that is what we need. He wants it to rub off on the boys. We know things haven’t been good enough and we need to pick up the standards.’ McCarthy has not long turned 24 but he speaks with maturity and it is easy to see why he is being regarded as a potential captain for club and country. ‘From the outside looking in, you can hear people starting to panic, saying “Everton this” and “Everton that”,’ says McCarthy. ‘We have got 10 games left to put it right. We need to stick together and we will only get up the table by doing that.’","Everton star James McCarthy has suffered injury problems this season .

"Paul Scholes has once again defended former Manchester United team-mate Jonny Evans following his spitting incident with Newcastle's Papiss Cisse. The former England midfielder believes Evans spat towards the floor in a 'reflex action' after the Senegal striker kicked out at him during Wednesday night's match at St James' Park. Both players have been charged with spitting by the Football Association - Cisse accepted the charge and will serve a seven-match ban, while Evans has until 6pm on Friday to respond. Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored Newcastle United striker . Evans's former Manchester United team-mate Paul Scholes has defended the player . Scholes also defended Evans will working as a pundit on the match for BT Sport on Wednesday . Having leapt to the defence of Evans while working as a pundit during BT Sport's coverage of the match, Scholes has again backed the Northern Ireland defender. Scholes writes in his Independent column: 'I have watched the footage of Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse's spitting incident and I come to the same conclusion that was my instinct the first time I saw the replay: I don't think Jonny ever intended to spit at Cisse. 'As Jonny gets up and takes a step backwards, he spits. At the time his eyes are fixed on Cisse... and that is what makes it look bad. But my instinct is that Jonny is spitting to the floor. 'It is a reflex. Footballers, athletes in all sorts of sports, have a tendency to spit in the periods of respite after action. You can do it without even thinking. 'I know that I did, as a player. On this occasion, I believes it was a reflex action from Jonny. Not one aimed at Cisse.' Evans could face a ban of six matches if found guilty by the Football Association. Papiss Cisse subsequently retaliates, and appears to aim spit of his own back at the Manchester United man . Evans (left) and Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Everton (a), March 15 . Arsenal (h), March 21 . Sunderland (a), April 5 . Liverpool (a), April 13 . Tottenham (h), April 19 . Swansea (h), April 25 . Leicester (a), May 2 . Both Cisse and Evans released statements on Thursday in which they disagreed on the intent behind the disgusting scenes. Bizarrely, Evans claimed he was shocked by the allegations and protested his innocence. Cisse responded by apologising but said he was provoked when Evans spat at him. Indeed, Sportsmail understands that Cisse is furious that the Northern Ireland international has not admitted his guilt, and is adamant the defender spat at his leg. And Cisse will inform FA disciplinary chiefs that Evans intentionally spat at him when questioned about the incident. Cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the FA on Thursday . This season, FA guidelines  dictate that the punishment for spitting should be in line with FIFA's six game ban for the offence. Cisse faces an additional one game ban because he has already been sent off for violent conduct after elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman (above) in December. Having conceded he was wrong to react by spitting in Evans’s face, Cisse will be fined a week’s wages of around £40,000 by Newcastle, who will now be without their 11-goal top scorer until May. FA rules were changed in the summer to bring them in line with FIFA guidelines which state a player found guilty of spitting at an opponent will be suspended for six games. However, Cisse has already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing Everton’s Seamus Coleman and as a result will be hit with an additional one-game suspension. He will not return until the final three matches of the campaign. Evans, meanwhile, could miss crucial Premier League fixtures against Spurs, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea should he be found guilty. But the 27-year-old will contest the charge, to which he must respond by 6pm on Friday evening. The Senegalese striker points the finger at United defender Evans after the ugly incident . Newcastle managing director Lee Charnley said: 'Both ourselves and Papiss agree that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable. 'In life, when you do something wrong you have to front up, admit your mistakes and accept the punishment. Papiss was proactive this morning in making a full and heartfelt apology, which he did in advance of any notification from the FA regarding this charge. 'This was something he felt strongly about and we fully support him in quickly accepting the charge. 'Papiss is known to many of our region's schools, community groups and junior football teams for his involvement in the work of the Newcastle United Foundation. 'He has this evening expressed to us his strong desire to engage in additional community activities during the period of his ban. 'He is particularly keen to use his position as a role model to encourage young and influential fans to engage in sport and learn lessons about the importance of fair play and personal conduct.' Evans’s statement read: ‘Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night’s match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. ‘I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. ‘During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. ‘It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.’ Tempers threaten to boil over as team-mates from Newcastle and United gather on the pitch . Cisse was banned for an extra man after beinf sent off for elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman in December . The FA were waiting for referee Anthony Taylor's report. As he missed the incident between Jonny Evans and Pappis Cisse, and it wasn't included in his report -  the FA were within their right to retrospectively punish the pair. Hull striker George Boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, the FA have issued new guidelines to move in line with new FIFA guidelines meaning Evans and Cisse could now be banned for six games. Cisse responded less than an hour later by saying: ‘I have apologies to make to a lot of people today. Firstly to my team-mates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny. ‘I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be a positive role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down. ‘I hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry. Perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake, not copy it.’","Evans and Cisse were involved in a spitting incident on Wednesday night .

"Arsene Wenger has hit back at Paul Scholes following the former England midfielder’s criticism of Mesut Ozil. Manchester United legend Scholes has accused the £42.5million man of ‘going through the motions’ during his time with the Gunners in comments made to a national newspaper. But the Arsenal manager has defended his record signing, saying: ‘It’s a wrong statement. He works very hard and he’s a great player. A player like Paul Scholes would have loved to play with Ozil. Mesut has a point to prove and he knows that. Paul Scholes hit out at German playmaker Mesut Ozil by insisting he took easy option when he joined Arsenal . Arsenal ace Ozil has scored four goals during the course of the current campaign . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has leaped to Ozil's defence by hitting back at former United ace Scholes . ‘I believe he has the quality, he puts a lot of effort in to help the team and he works much harder than his style shows. ‘You can be cheated a little bit by his style of play, because he is fluid, easy, subtle and he does not look like he puts the effort in, but he does.’ Meanwhile, Wenger has launched a staunch defence of summer signing Danny Welbeck as the forward prepares for his Manchester United return. After arriving at the Emirates Stadium intent on playing as a central striker, the England international has found himself playing out wide again, a position he found frustrating during his time at Old Trafford. He has scored seven goals since arriving from United in August — three of those coming in a Champions League win over Galatasaray. But ahead of Monday’s FA Cup quarter-final, Wenger insists Welbeck has not been a £16million flop. Wenger and Ozil in training at London Colney ahead of their FA Cup clash against Manchester United . Ozil has divided opinion among Arsenal fans and the wider public since arriving in England . Wenger also defended former Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck's impact at Arsenal . ‘He’s very important and has played many games since the start of the season,’ said Wenger — who confirmed central defender Gabriel will miss up to three weeks with a hamstring injury. ‘If you check the statistics you will see (the suggestion Welbeck doesn’t play often) is wrong. He’s one of the players who has played the most games for us, but not in the last couple of games. Wenger also spoke to Sportsmail’s Martin Keown in an interview for the BBC’s Football Focus, to be broadcast on Saturday. In it, the Arsenal manager, who has won the FA Cup five times, discussed his favourite memories of the competition and which of the wins meant most to him. Wenger said: ‘Maybe the first one against Newcastle was the best because it was when we won the double in 1998. I remember absolutely everything about that day because it was at Wembley. When I was a kid in France I saw the cup finals. For me to come from a little village and go for the first time to Wembley was something special. It was a great old stadium, the soul was there, the grass was special.’ Scholes believes the likes of Manchester United's Robin van Persie left Arsenal because they were ambitious . The likes of Cesc Fabregas and Thierry Henry also left Arsenal to add to their personal trophy collection . But when asked about his collection of medals, Wenger admitted he cared little for them. He said: ‘I don’t even know where they are. Maybe I will regret it. I would like to think I get more out of the human side of my career. ‘I prefer to have a box of memories than a box of medals. What is interesting is that you can have an influence on people’s lives. They can have a big influence on you as well.’ Arsenal face United on Monday and Wenger enjoyed many classic cup ties against Sir Alex Ferguson’s side, but he said the pair’s frosty relationship had thawed in recent years. ‘I am happy to see him now,’ said Wenger, ‘more than before because we have gone through some different periods. In the end it became more respectful and of course he was not always objective in defending his team. Nor was I! That created disagreements. ‘Now we are happy to have dinner together and a good glass of wine and rise above the differences.’ But Monday’s tie doesn’t please him. ‘I wanted to play at home. But fantastic game or not, what is important is that you go through. It would have been better at home. Now it is what it is, you want to qualify for the semi-final.’","Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has hit back at ex-United ace Paul Scholes .

"Swansea manager Garry Monk feels his former boss Brendan Rodgers is capable of managing Barcelona or Real Madrid one day. Monk crosses swords again with Rodgers at the Liberty Stadium on Monday night having lost all three of his previous meetings with the Liverpool manager and the Northern Irishman's stock at Anfield is rising rapidly again. Liverpool have gone 12 games unbeaten in the Barclays Premier League as they close in on a top-four spot which would secure Champions League qualification for the second successive year after almost ending the club's 24-year wait for the title last season. Garry Monk believes former boss Brendan Rodgers is capable of managing Barcelona or Real Madrid one day . It is a far cry from the autumn when Liverpool were struggling to emerge from the post-Luis Suarez era at a time when Daniel Sturridge was injured and they lost four successive games in both league and cup. But the upturn in their fortunes has led to reports that Manchester City are making admiring glances towards Merseyside and, asked if Rodgers was equipped to manage Barcelona or Real sometime in the future, Monk replied: 'Yes, he can manage at the top, for sure. 'He's got the knowledge, know-how and capabilities in man-management. He's got the package to do it at the elite of Europe. Rodgers admitted earlier this month that he feared the sack at Liverpool prior to changing squad formation . 'Whether that's an ambition he has at Liverpool or it is an ambition to be at the really elite I don't know. 'But I'm sure he wants to take Liverpool to those heights again.' Rodgers admitted earlier this month that he feared the sack at Liverpool prior to changing the formation to three at the back which sparked their climb up the table. But Monk, club captain at Swansea when Rodgers steered the Welsh club into the Premier League in 2011 via the Championship play-offs, says that would have been a foolish move and applauds his courage to change a system which had proved so successful last season. Monk knows all about Rodgers' managerial ways having been club captain during his time at Swansea City . 'I've spoken to him about it and the pressure at the bigger clubs is constant but I think he handles it very well,' said Monk, who remains in regular contact with Rodgers. 'Transition's never easy, especially after a fantastic season, and just missing out on that title will have knocked the confidence of the players initially. 'It takes time to get that confidence back but he's done that and he also had quite an influx of players in the summer. 'All credit to Brendan for having the bravery to change it to what players probably weren't used to. He did it at a period where it could have been a risk but it's paid dividends.' Rodgers shows off the play-off trophy  after winning promotion to the Premier League with Swansea . Liverpool's renaissance has taken them to within two points of fourth-placed Manchester United and Monk feels they will improve still further if they qualify for the Champions League again. 'I know he was disappointed with the Champions League this season but if they can push on and get in there again I think they'll do better next year,' Monk said. 'He's evolving as a manager and he's obviously more confident in his own ability than when he was at Swansea. 'That comes with going to a big club, being on a big stage and performing there.' Former Swansea boss Rodgers is thrown in the air by his players after winning  at Wembley Stadium .","Garry Monk says Brendan Rodgers can manage Barcelona or Real Madrid .

"Mardy Fish made an impressive return to the tour after an 18-month absence but fell just short against fellow American Ryan Harrison in the first round of the BNP Paribas Open on Thursday. Former world No 7 Fish battled for two hours and 36 minutes before losing to fellow American Harrison, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (3). Fish had two match points at 15-40 in the 10th game of the third set, but Harrison wiggled free. After both held serve to force the tiebreak, Harrison won three points in a row to go up 5-2. Fish's double fault gave Harrison match point and the 22-year-old closed it out with an ace. Mardy Fish made his return to the tour in Indian Wells on Thursday after an 18-month absence . Ryan Harrison hits a backhand volley on his way to a three-set victory against fellow American Fish . Fish, 33, had not played on the ATP Tour since August 2013 because of heart problems that have plagued him since March 2012. A finalist in 2008, when he lost to Novak Djokovic, Fish said that despite the long layoff the loss to Harrison 'stings a little bit'. But there were positives. 'I've worked really hard in the past 3 1/2 months to get back in shape,' Fish said, 'So, I don't have any issues sort of during a match or after a match. 'I worked extremely hard to put myself in the best position to not have to worry about things when I was out there - if I was out of shape or if I didn't feel well or if it was going to be a long match or a hot match or something like that, when a lot more things creep into your head.' Fish chases out to his left to reach for the return in his first-round match at the BNP Paribas Open . Harrison ends up on his back during one point but later progresses to the second round in Indian Wells . American wildcard Tim Smyczek was among those advancing as the men began play on Thursday, but two-time champion Daniela Hantuchova was among those eliminated on the second day of women's action. The 2002 and 2007 winner was a 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 loser to Klara Koukalova of the Czech Republic. Vera Zvonareva, the 2009 champion, also lost, 6-1, 6-1 to qualifier Polona Hercog of Slovakia, and Chinese qualifier Lin Zhu ousted 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone of Italy.

"The Brisbane apartment where Marcus Volke murdered his transgender wife, dismembered her body and cooked her remains is now on the rental market. Volke killed his Indonesian wife and sex worker, Mayang Prasetyo, in October last year in their apartment on Commercial Road in Teneriffe in Brisbane's inner-city. The brutal crime ended with Volke - who was a male escort - taking his own life in a nearby industrial bin. Scroll down for video . This eerie photo features the stove top used by Marcus Volke to boil the remains of Mayang Prasetyo's body . The couple met Melbourne brothel Pleasure Dome while they were both working as escorts in 2009 . The property was listed online in late February as a ‘fully furnished apartment’ looking to fetch $500 a week for rent. The advertisement has since been removed however it is still believed to be available upon private inquiry. Four other apartments in the complex are currently being advertised. Eerie photos of the apartment feature a shot of the stove Mr Volke used to boil the remains of his deceased partner. Properties like Volke’s that have an unsavoury past are more commonly referred to as ‘stigmatised properties’. The apartment on Commercial Road in Teneriffe in Brisbane's inner-city has four other apartments on the market . Queensland Police removed a toxic-labelled container following the discovery of Ms Prasetyo's body parts found boiling in chemicals in a Brisbane apartment . If these walls could talk: As the apartment was the site of a brutal murder it is classed as a stigmatised property . Properties are considered stigmatised if a murder, suicide, death from natural causes, violent crime or drug related offence took place on the property. It can even be considered stigmatised if the previous owners believed the house was haunted. While real estate agents are not obligated to advertise events that have occurred in the property, they must disclose the information to interested parties. Stigmatised: The real estate agent was asking for around $500 for the 'fully furnished' apartment . This isn’t the first property in recent times to come on the market with a dark past. In Sydney’s Hyde Park, the luxurious apartment where Simon Gittany murdered his fiancé Lisa Harnam failed to sell despite expectations it would be picked up for more than $2 million dollars. Emergency services remove her body from the DoubleOne 3 Apartments in Commercial Road . The remains of Ms Prasetyo were found cooking inside a Teneriffe apartment - in Brisbane's inner-city - in Ocrober of last year. Volke fled the scene when police showed up at the couple's home and was later found with his throat slashed and a knife in an industrial bin nearby.

"Andy Murray is not sure about Jonas Bjorkman's dancing but is confident the Swede will prove a valuable addition to his coaching team. The 42-year-old is to join Murray for a trial week at some point in the next month with a view to working with the Scot on a permanent basis alongside his main coach Amelie Mauresmo. The exact timing of that week is up in the air because Bjorkman is currently competing on Let's Dance, the Swedish version of Strictly Come Dancing. Andy Murray talks to his main coach Amelie Mauresmo during a training session in Indian Wells . The Scot, who could add Jonas Bjorkman to his team, practices his serve with coach Mauresmo watching on . Murray and Mauresmo take a moments rest during training ahead of Murray's Indian Wells challenge . Murray, whose mother Judy was a high-profile contestant on the last series of the British show, told BBC Radio Five Live: 'I haven't seen him dance yet but apparently he's one of the favourites to win so he must be all right.' With Mauresmo only committed to working with Murray for 25 weeks a year, the world number four has made finding an additional coach a priority. The role had been filled under Ivan Lendl and then Mauresmo by his long-time friend Dani Vallverdu until the pair went their separate ways at the end of last season. The aim will be for Bjorkman to travel with Murray during the weeks when Mauresmo is unavailable, while they will also work together at certain times of the year. Murray said: 'We've agreed for him to work with us for a week just to try and see how it goes. Normally when I've started working with coaches I've done that. 'I know him very well from when he played. He was one of the older guys when I came on the tour and he was very good to me. He's a very nice person, good sense of humour. And he was an exceptional tennis player who made the most of his ability. Former world No 4 Jonas Bjorkman will join up with Team Murray for a trial week as assistant coach . 'A lot of Swedes turn out to be good coaches. They've got a good mindset, they're very calm individuals and extremely hard workers. Hopefully when we try it out together it works well.' Bjorkman reached number four in the singles rankings and number one in doubles, winning nine grand slam titles. Since retiring in 2008 he has worked in the media, as a coach with Sweden's Davis Cup team and behind the scenes at the ATP tournaments in Bastad and Stockholm. He becomes the latest Swede to take up a high-profile coaching role in men's tennis after Magnus Norman, who guided Stan Wawrinka to the Australian Open title last year, and Roger Federer's part-time mentor Stefan Edberg. Bjorkman agreed with Murray's assessment of Swedish strengths but also said he hoped to bring energy and fun to training sessions. Andy Murray celebrates after securing victory for Great Britain against the USA in the Davis Cup in Glasgow . Recalling how he became friends with Murray, Bjorkman said: 'I always spent quite a lot of time around Tim (Henman). 'When Andy came along, he was going to be the new superstar, I met him straight away and we connected well. 'He's a great guy, great sense of humour. Both of us like to have a little bit of a trash talk, we are interested in other sports. The only negative was he beat me twice. But I'm really looking forward to it.' Bjorkman revealed he has been speaking to Mauresmo on the phone and believes they are singing from the same hymn sheet when it comes to Murray's game. Andy Murray takes aim with a serve as he prepares for the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells . 'It feels great,' he said. 'I really like the way she believes Andy should play and how they've been working. 'Andy's in a great situation now, he played phenomenal tennis in Australia. The match against (Tomas) Berdych I believe was the best since his injury. He's at his prime with his age and has some interesting years ahead of him.' Murray and Mauresmo are currently in Indian Wells for the first Masters tournament of the season, where he will begin his campaign this weekend against Canadian Vasek Pospisil. The Scot, meanwhile, has also committed to playing at the ATP tournament in Washington in August as part of his build-up to the US Open. He reached the final on his only previous appearance nine years ago.","Andy Murray will work with Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman for a trial period .

"Manny Pacquiao plans to make Floyd Mayweather Jnr dance to his tune on May 2, and the Filipino icon gave fans a sample of his entrance music as the pair came head to head in Los Angeles. Pacquiao and Mayweather faced the world's media for the only time before fight week on Wednesday night as both men vowed to conquer the other in their $300million (£200m) Las Vegas showdown. But before he took to the stage, Pacquiao delivered a rendition of 'I will fight for the Philippines', an unreleased track he has recorded for his walk on at the MGM Grand. Manny Pacquiao treats reporters to a rendition of his entrance song 'I will fight for the Philippines' Manny Pacquiao will walk out for his fight against Floyd Mayweather to a song he has recorded himself .

"Paul Scholes has confirmed he will not be taking over as Oldham Athletic manager. As revealed by Sportsmail, the League One side wanted to make the Manchester United legend Lee Johnson's replacement but Scholes did not feel the timing was right. And the 40-year-old, who lives in the town, confirmed the decision in his column in the Independent on Friday. Paul Scholes is a lifelong Oldham Athletic fan but feels the timing is not right for the manager's job . Scholes says there is no way he would ever combine a coaching job with his work on television . He said he was tempted by the offer and believes he will one day manage Oldham but added: 'I just did not feel this was the right time. 'When I go into management, I want to do so with 100 per cent commitment. At the moment I have a lot of responsibilities and things going on in my life that I cannot simply drop immediately. Most importantly I have a young family who need their dad around, having been away a lot during my playing career. 'There was no way, for example, I would ever have tried to combine a coaching job with my work on television.' Scholes, who only played for Manchester United, has not ruled out being Oldham boss in the future . Lee Johnson left League One side Oldham Athletic to become manager of Barnsley . Former Oldham boss Iain Dowie is the fans' favourite for the job and is expected to meet chairman Simon Corney this weekend although whether the club can give him assurances over the availability of funds to strengthen the squad is unclear. Others linked with the post include ex-Chelsea defender Winston Bogarde, former Oldham striker Shefki Kuqi and Huddersfield Town coach Steve Eyre. Oldham, who go to Yeovil Town on Saturday, are three points outside the play-offs with a game in hand on many of their rivals.

"What appeared to virtually everyone in boxing to be one of the most bitter feuds in the annals of the hard old game turned out to be a love in. Or so Floyd Mayweather and Bob Arum told us as they walked onto a famous stage here as collaborators in the big sell of the richest fight of all time. Money talks. Louder than the maestro of the ring who calls himself by that bizarre nickname. Floyd Mayweather speaks as Manny Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum looks on in Los Angeles on Wednesday . Mayweather and Arum insist there is no lasting animosity after they went their separate ways in business . Mayweather (left) and Pacquiao meet in a long-awaited mega-fight on May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas . More noisily than the promoter who has banged the drum for many of the biggest fights ever, from Ali-Frazier 1 all the way to Mayweather-Pacquiao this May 2 in Las Vegas . ‘Animosity?’ said Arum of his relationship with Mayweather who, in his prime, walked out on him. ‘Nah.’ ‘Never a problem between us,’ said Mayweather. But wasn’t it Mayweather who always blamed Arum, subsequently Pacquiao’s promoter, whenever the moguls failed to make this match for which Planet Earth has been clamouring for five years. ‘No,’ said the No 1 pound-for-pound boxer in the world. ‘The only reason we broke up was because it was time for me to become my own promoter. ‘Me and my father (also his trainer) and my uncles (also his corner men when called upon) to become the Boxing Mayweathers. ‘I needed to get that experience for when it came to giving back to the sport by helping the youngsters.’ Mayweather, here with Justin Bieber, said there was '‘Never a problem between us' in relation to Arum . 'Animosity? Nah,' said Arum of Mayweather. He (left) is now the promoter for Pacquiao . ‘Blame me,’ said Arum. ‘It was a generational thing. Floyd wanted me to reach out to the African-American audience. But that was a different cultural group from when we put on Ali and Frazier and Foreman. ‘Floyd saw the potential in the hip-hop community but I could not connect with them. So, yes, it was time for him to go off on his own.’ Money - not the man but the $350 million to half a billion dollars this fight is expected to generate – is a powerful healing agent. These old rivals thanked each other – as well as everyone else they could think of – for bringing home this mother lode. The last vestiges of a dark age in which boxers were exploited and then left to rot with the after-effects of being battered about the head have been condemned to history by this deal. One which has coerced rival cable TV giants Showtime and HBO into sharing their part of the spoils. One which is not so much a commercial world record breaker as out of this world. ‘All of boxing will be elevated by this fight,’ says Arum. All is forgiven. Arum (left) said his split from Mayweather was a 'generational thing' and that there's no hard feelings . Remember Mayweather demanding Olympic standard random drugs testing, a stipulation which cast aspersions as to how Pacquiao had managed to keep rising through the weights to win world titles in an unprecedented – and probably unsurpassable – eight divisions? And then Pacquiao suggesting a $5 million penalty if either of them failed such a test? That bet was turned down by Mayweather but Arum explains: ‘It wasn’t because Floyd was any more scared about the result than Manny. It was just that he and his team figured they would get a lot more if Manny didn’t pass the test. Just as we knew we would get a damn sight more than $5million if Floyd failed the test.’ They still differ on some of the fine points when it comes to claiming credit for making this mega-bucks spectacular finally happen. Mayweather says: ‘The chance meeting between me and Manny at the basketball game and then our talk in his hotel room got all this together. ‘After that I rang Al Haymon (the new Svengali for top boxers) every week. The first time he said ""Not Yet"". The second and third time, ""Not Yet."" Then he said ""Almost"" and we got it done.’ Mayweather arrives in the arena ahead of the glitzy press conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday night . Pacquiao, a resounding underdog for the fight, gets his own rousing reception on entry for the appearance . Arum talks of how his meeting with CBS television chief Les Moonves broke the deadlock: ‘He told me he could bring Floyd to the table and I believed him. So when he asked if I would meet with Al Haymon I said of course and we worked out the major issues in a couple of hours. ‘Then we got together with HBO and Showtime and it took only minutes for them to agree to share the broadcast. There will still some small details to be resolved but although they maybe took longer than they should have we got it done.’ The fans couldn’t care less who got it done. The world waits with bated breath for the two best boxers on the planet to move on from this face-to-face in Los Angeles to opposite corners of the ring in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. ‘The best against the best,’ says Mayweather. ‘That’s what makes it so exciting.’ It has always been thus. Only sometimes it takes money to make even the best see sense. Like a minimum $180 million for Mayweaher, $120 million for Pacquiao. A fortune so vast that it is more than Ali, Frazier and Foreman ever dreamed of.","Floyd Mayweather and Bob Arum, now Manny Pacquiao's promoter, both said they have no problem with each other despite famously falling out .

"Two days after struggling with her emotions on her competitive return to the BNP Paribas Open, Serena Williams was in a much more relaxed mood on Sunday as she powered her way into the fourth round. The American world No 1, who made a nervous start before battling past Romania's Monica Niculescu 7-5 7-5 in her opening match, was back to business as usual with a 6-2 6-0 demolition of Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas. 'I was able to relax because I was able to do more of the right things and not make as many mistakes as I did in my last round,' said Williams, who boycotted the Indian Wells event for 14 years after winning the 2001 final. Serena Williams made short work of Zarina Diyas, winning 6-2, 6-0 to reach the Indian Wells fourth round . Diyas, of Kazakhstan, had little answer to the play of world No 1 Williams . 'I think with that, that helped me to be able to relax even more. It definitely felt back to normal out there. Just trying to feel the rhythm and trying to focus on the ball more than anything else.' Williams, a 19-times grand slam singles champion, had been apprehensive and 'a little nervous' after finally deciding to return to Indian Wells after such a long time away. Fourteen years ago, she was booed by the crowd as she beat Kim Clijsters in the final to win her second title at the California desert resort, where her father Richard Williams alleged he had heard racist taunts. The heckling by the crowd was in apparent response to Serena's sister Venus having withdrawn from their semi-final that year just minutes before the match, citing injury. Williams believes that, despite an impressive performance against Diyas, there is more to come . Diyas hits a forehand as she tried in vain to get a foothold in the match against Williams . Williams said she felt more relaxed and back to normal against Diyas than she did against Monica Niculescu . Williams and Diyas congratulate each other at the net after the match came to a swift end . On Friday, however, Serena received a standing ovation before the start of her match against Niculescu, an experience she described as 'amazing'. Asked what her father and sister Venus had said to her after her opening match, Serena replied: 'They just said, 'Good job.' They were both really proud. 'The standing ovation was amazing. I really felt excited by it. I think it's been a really great learning experience for everyone involved. Williams was overwhelmed by the reception she got from crowd on her return to Indian Wells after 14 years . Williams was given a standing ovation during her game against Niculescu on Friday . 'It was what it was, but I have kind of like really tried to zone into tournament mode and tournament focus. That's what I'm just trying to get ready for the rest of the event.' Against the outclassed Diyas, Williams looked every inch a world No 1, though she felt she still had some way to go before she reached her optimum tournament level. 'I feel like I can do a lot better in terms of just being mentally prepared and mentally ready,' said the 33-year-old. 'That's what I'm just going to try to do ... is just keep going.' Next up for Williams is Sloane Stephens, who beat two-time major champion Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-6 (4), 1-6, 6-4.","Serena Williams beat Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas 6-2, 6-0 on Sunday .

PSG play Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in a Champions League last-16 second leg on Wednesday night . Fouls committed in the Champions League this season . Chelsea 87 . PSG 83 . Nemanja Matic 17 . Blaise Matuidi* 15 . *highest ranked PSG player . 'This season we've played against sides form the Championship in the cups, against teams from League One, and Shrewsbury from League Two, but the most aggressive team was PSG.' Eden Hazard was often the victim at the Parc des Princes, though Laurent Blanc has also claimed Diego Costa is capable of 'dirty tricks' and has told the referee to watch out. It promises to be a tough night for Bjorn Kuipers. Not only with PSG, but with Chelsea - who have committed more fouls than PSG in the competition this season - and Nemanja Matic, whose foul-count is higher than any of Blanc's players. But as the two teams look to reach the quarter-finals, who are the PSG players Mourinho feels so strongly about? Are they more aggressive than those in a League two side? Visit Squawka for more Champions League stats and facts . Blaise Matuidi (left) and Marquinhos (right) double up to take down Eden Hazard during the first leg in Paris . David Luiz and Thiago Silva . Graceful, skillful, blessed with flair; those are the characteristics usually associated with Brazilian footballers... but not these two defenders. Their rugged approach against Chelsea in the first leg angered the visiting players. That was especially case with former Blues defender Luiz. The unconventional centre back was obviously eager to make a point to Mourinho, who sold him for a staggering fee of £50million in the summer. Luiz operated in midfield in Paris and clattered into Hazard and Cesc Fabregas, as well as going head-to-head with Costa. He is set to operate further back on Wednesday night, so will look to join forces with Thiago Silva and get on Costa's nerves again. Luiz and Thiago Silva (right, sporting a black eye) will be looking to dominate Diego Costa at Stamford Bridge . Luiz tugs back Fabregas (left) and squares up to Costa (right) during the first leg . Marco Verratti . In a midfield three that usually sees tough-tacklers Thiago Motta and Blaise Matuidi surround him, Verratti - who has been compared to Andrea Pirlo - is often looked at as the 'nice guy'. But the Italian youngster showed he had a bit of the Paul Scholes about him as he launched into tackles against Chelsea last month. One in particular, on Hazard once again, should have resulted in a red card for the 22-year-old. His passing range and balance on the ball is something to be admired, but Oscar, Willian and Hazard should be wary of more late lunges from Verratti and co. Marco Verratti is not known for his tackling ability but could have seen red for this challenge on Hazard . The Italian midfielder went in with his studs up and caught Hazard over the top of the ball . Zlatan Ibrahimovic . 'Even a player like Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), a typical attacking player – came back when they lost the ball and attacked Hazard from behind when we were countering,' Mourinho claimed in his press conference on Tuesday. The controversial striker may not be regarded as much of a team player and rarely defends from the front with his running, but it is evident he will do what it takes to win. The Swede has been sent off 10 times in his club career, with offences including slapping a player in the face. He has only just returned to action after serving a two-game ban after going in studs-up, over the top of the ball against Saint-Etienne. Chelsea beware. Ibrahimovic comes from behind to take down Hazard... will he be in that mood again at Stamford Bridge?","Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says Paris Saint-Germain are the most aggressive side his team have played this season .

"Terrorists have developed several new techniques to communicate with each online by leaving coded messages on websites like eBay and Reddit, claims a new book. The shocking discovery made by intelligence officers and code breakers in Israel, Britain and the United States revealed that seemingly innocuous chats are often much more, according to new sections in the book Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad. Code breakers found that al-Qaeda is now using a technique to encrypt its messages in goods offered for sale on eBay. Communication: Terrorists have developed several new techniques to communicate with each online by leaving coded messages on websites like eBay and Reddit . Secretive: Code breakers have found that al-Qaeda is now using a technique to encrypt its messages in goods offered for sale on eBay . Meanwhile, Israeli intelligence officers who spent time tracking the Internet message board Reddit found more than once, that a terrorist used hexadecimal characters and prime numbers as code. After the messages were decoded, they sometimes indicated an attack was being planned or even about to happen, according to excerpts printed in The New York Post. Terrorists are even hiding messages in 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target,' one intelligence source told author Gordon Thomas. In a fight back, MI6 in London and Mossad have recruited linguist specialists in Arabic, Urdu and Pashto to translate the online magazines that both al-Qaeda and ISIS are publishing with instructions. This, they hope will infiltrate a message about a planned attack before it takes place. In the wake of the brutal Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, both ISIS and al-Qaeda have been concealing messages to their followers. Both Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, and MI6 in London confirm that there has been an increase in this type of traffic online, according to the book. Cyber unit: The eleventh director of Mossad, Tamir Pardo, pictured, determined that Israel would use a cyber unit to avoid experiencing an event similar to the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 . Electronic war: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the country's electronic battles against cyberattacks were regarded as Israel's most important defense . Mossad: The front page of the website for Israel's spy agency says it sees the 'invisible' and does the 'impossible' However, when an attack appears imminent in a particular country, Mossad sends details to that nation's intelligence service's cybercommand. By working with each other in unison, intelligence agencies hope to  prevent future attacks. Cyber units worldwide are becoming increasingly important in the fight against terror. A number of the most skilled cryptologists in the Mossad unit for example, have mastered steganography, how to conceal secret information within a digital file. Cryptologists have the ability to explore an area inaccessible to the search engines of Google, Yahoo and Bing called the dark side, or dark web. This no-go zone contains billions of Web pages and is estimated to be 5,000 times larger than any other on the Internet. Much of this information is detailed in a 2015 version of a book by author Gordon Thomas called 'Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad.' It delves into the clandestine world of Israel's spy agency, the Mossad. Mossad is using its new cyberwarfare department to track threats and attack Iran's nuclear capacity. The eleventh director of the spy agency, Tamir Pardo, was determined that Israel would not experience an event similar to the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York in 2001. This decision came after it was revealed that an intercepted phone message by the American National Security Agency hinted at the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon - but it was caught too late. Pardo understood the importance of cyberwarfare after undergoing training at the NSA. He was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who told him that their electronic battles against cyberattacks were regarded as Israel's most important defense. Meanwhile, Iain Lobban, the head of Britain's Government Communication Headquarters revealed the country's Ministry of Defense was once targeted over 1,000 times a month. He identified the attacks were mostly coming from the Tenth Bureau, the highly secret department of China's People Liberation Army responsible for science and technology. In the United States, General Keith B. Alexander, the head of the Pentagon's Cyber Command, confirmed that 'our targets are enemy military command centers that we can reach from cyberspace.'","Al-Qaeda  encrypts its messages in goods offered for sale on eBay, according to new claims from the book Gideon’s Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad .

"Just for a second, Tony Mowbray allowed himself to drift off into a brighter future before crashing back to the remorseless reality of Coventry City’s present. ‘I look to the summer time and how we are going to build a team that is a Coventry City team,’ the new manager began. ‘But that’s for another day. The immediate concern is just to win some matches.’ Tony Mowbray issues instructions from the touchline during his first game in charge of Coventry . Coventry's Jim O'Brien opens the scoring for the home side in just the fourth minute of the match . For Mowbray, who arrived at the club last week, Coventry City is a club of heritage and romance. It is Keith Houchen’s diving header crashing into the Wembley net in 1987, it is Jimmy Hill leading the ‘Sky Blue Revolution’, it is of a team that was a staple of the top division for 34 years. He has vowed to take them back there, to their ‘rightful place’. The reality is very different. Today, Hill’s bronze statue stands outside a superstore for the rugby club Wasps, whose amber and black logo looms over the main entrance. They own the place; Coventry City are strangers in their own home, seeking to get out in the next few years. The Ricoh Arena is magnificent, ready for the top flight. But few thought that would mean Premiership rugby union rather than Premier League football. Confidence has drained, crowds are down. When the club returned from their exile in Northampton 35 miles away back in September, over 27,000 packed into the ground. On Saturday, a mere 9,446 turned out. The potential for massive crowds is obvious but poor form has seen many return their scarves to the back of the wardrobe. The Coventry wide man wheels away in celebration after giving his side the perfect start . It’s because Coventry are staring at the indignity of fourth-tier football for the first time since 1959 and, after this chastening reintroduction to management after 16 months away, Mowbray is in no doubt as to how precarious their situation is. ‘If we’d sat here and we’d won, I’d be telling you how great it was but as a football manager it really hurts,’ he reflected. ‘The highs are really good, the lows low but there’s not much in between. ‘It would have been nice to give the fans a victory. I don’t think the players let them down but we are where we are.’ To be exact, still a sole point above the relegation zone after an afternoon that had started so positively for his team. The mere presence of the former Hibernian, West Brom, Celtic and Middlesbrough boss seemed to energise the place initially and Coventry led on four minutes through captain Jim O’Brien. The former Middlesbrough and Celtic manager holds his arms aloft in appeal at the Ricoh Arena . They were comfortable until two Port Vale goals just before the break turned the tables. Tom Pope and then the impressive Mark Marshall, released by Mowbray’s predecessor Steven Pressley in the summer, exposed defensive flaws. But Coventry rallied and when Sanmi Odelusi came off the bench to level, they had all the momentum with 20 minutes to play. Alas, six minutes later, Michael O’Connor’s free-kick handed the three points to Vale, who are just two points off the play-offs. Their manager, Rob Page, made 70 league appearances for Coventry as a defender. He certainly doesn’t want to see them slide into League Two. ‘I think they have just brought in a fantastic manager,’ he said. ‘I think he will keep them up and then build in the summer for next season.’ For Mowbray, though, it’s only the here and now that matters. PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . Derby County were about to go top of the Championship as goals from Jamie Ward and Tom Ince put them 2-0 up against Birmingham. But Gary Rowett’s men staged a stunning stoppage-time comeback through a Paul Caddis penalty and Clayton Donaldson’s leveller. Clayton Donaldon (left) gets first to the ball as he knocks the ball home from close range . The former Brentford striker(right) secured a last-gasp point for Birmingham at Derby on Saturday .

Aston Villa loanee Gary Gardner scored a cracker as Nottingham Forest’s resurgence under Dougie Freedman continued with a 2-1 win over title-chasing Middlesbrough. Simon Grayson’s Preston North End have hit form at the perfect time. Their 2-0 win at MK Dons was their sixth win in seven in the league, all coming with clean sheets.","Tony Mowbray suffered defeat in his first game in charge of Coventry .

"A man has successfully sued the police after they made off with his car. James Ferrari of Manhattan was charged with a DUI in 2009 when he was pulled over for speeding while driving near his weekend home in Bellport, and the arresting officers seized his vehicle, a 2003 Ferrari Modena. Then, after a Suffolk County judge ruled the car belonged to the police, they auctioned the vehicle off.

Ferrari sued however, and now, a few years later, he has been awarded $95,000 by a jury after claiming the car was worth $110,000. 'I’m very happy that it’s done with,' Ferrari, 61, told the New York Post. 'The government taking people’s property isn’t right.' As for the coincidence between his vehicle and surname, he told the paper; 'There’s no relation . . .

"Andy Murray has backed the Queen's Club in London to host July's Davis Cup quarter-final between Great Britain and France. Great Britain sealed a second successive last-eight tie with a 3-2 victory against the USA in Glasgow last weekend. And the LTA is now looking to book a grass-court venue for the tie which takes place on July 17-19, the weekend following the conclusion of Wimbledon. Andy Murray, pictured winning his second round match in Indian Wells, wants to play Davis Cup at Queen's . Murray cheers from the sidelines as GB defeat USA to reach the Davis Cup quarter finals . Great Britain vs France . Australia vs Kazakhstan . Argentina vs Serbia . Canada vs Belgium . Sportsmail understands an approach was made to Queen's earlier this week to gauge the club's interest in holding the tie. Queen's hosts the AEGON Championships from June 15-21 where Murray has been a three time winner, picking up titles at the pre-Wimbledon event in 2009, 2011 and 2013. For Queen's to stage the Davis Cup this year, the temporary stands would have to remain in place for another four weeks and it remains to be seen whether the club would be willing to put up with the extra disruption as a result. Murray made it blatantly clear on Saturday, though, that Queen's is his preferred venue during a post-match interview after his second-round win against Vasek Pospisil in Indian Wells. Murray 'really likes the conditions' at Queen's Club where he has won the title three times . The British No 1 won the pre-Wimbledon tournament at Queen's in 2013 (left), 2011 (centre) and 2009 (right) Murray told Sky Sports: 'I hope we can do it at Queen's Club. They'll get a crowd there. I really like the conditions there. 'James Ward has played well there in the past. My brother [Jamie] made the final there last year so the players in our team have done well there. 'It just depends on if they can get the court ready on time and if they would like to host it. 'I think we need to play in an arena that is big enough for the tie and I think they can get 7,500-8,000 people there.

"Roberto Martinez has branded Everton’s current position in the Barclays Premier League ‘unacceptable’ but he has no intention of sacrificing their European dream. Everton have slithered onto the fringes of the relegation fight after only winning one league game in 2015 and they face crucial fixtures against Newcastle and Queens Park Rangers before the international break. Martinez accepts his position will be the subject of intense focus until results improve but he is refusing to panic. Roberto Martinez put his players through their paces during a training session on Wednesday . Martinez checks his watch as time runs out to prepare his side for the clash against Dynamo Kiev . Everton boss Martinez faced the media at Finch Farm ahead of the Europa League clash at Goodison . The manager is confident a big performance against Dynamo Kiev, coached by former Tottenham striker Sergei Rebrov, on Thursday night will be the catalyst for a sustained improvement over the final 10 games of the domestic campaign. Martinez said: ‘I know the severity of the situation and about not having margin for error. I have been brought up with it. I don’t think that is a problem. For us as a football club, the position we are in is unacceptable. ‘At the end of the season, we need to look at why it has happened. But for the time being, we need to show a real desire to win. Steven Naismith (centre) shares a joke during an Everton training session exercise on Wednesday . The Everton squad work hard in training ahead of facing Dynamo Kiev in the Europa League last 16 .

I will always accept that. I am not going to change now. The team is performing in a manner that we should have got more points. But the reality is we have got 28 points. Now every game is a final.’ Everton have been formidable in Europe this season and have won five of their eight matches and Martinez said: ‘In the Europa League, I think we have had an opportunity to show what we can do. 'We have played top teams but we have gone eye-to-eye with them. In the Premier League, everything that could go wrong, goes wrong.’","Everton take on Dynamo Kiev at Goodison Park in the Europa League .

"Cesc Fabregas perks up when he talks about the killer instinct, the ruthless streak that all teams develop at the start of a success story. On instant recall is the World Cup in 2010, when Spain turned to every available resource to reach the final after titanic struggles against Paraguay in the last eight and Germany in the semi-final. Fabregas was part of that team, realising a boyhood dream when he lifted the most famous trophy in world football with one of the best sides in history. Cesc Fabregas urged his team-mates to develop a killer instinct in order to progress past Paris Saint-Germain . Fabregas makes his way on to Chelsea's training pitch with John Terry, Cesar Azpilicueta and Gary Cahill . The Spanish midfielder jokingly wrestles with Didier Drogba and Terry during Tuesday's training session . Chelsea’s dressing room is developing a winning mentality again, lifting their first trophy together at Wembley 10 days ago when Jose Mourinho’s team won the Capital One Cup. It has given them belief. ‘When you unlock the mental fear of the quarter-final, which is what we did with the national team, we felt we could become champions,’ said Fabregas. ‘Once we were champions we were unstoppable, but you have to take this fear out and take it away. We have to believe we are the best. ‘We have to be ready mentally to win every situation because this game will not be a walk in the park.’ He was talking about Wednesday evening’s opponents Paris Saint-Germain, a tough nut to crack in the Champions League as Laurent Blanc’s team arrive in London protecting an unbeaten run that stretches back to January 10. Fabregas likes what he sees in the Chelsea dressing room and yet his experience, after nearly 500 appearances for club and country, tells him there is still room for improvement. ‘If there is one thing missing it is killing teams,’ he admitted. ‘Sometimes we don’t kill them when we have the chance. ‘When we score one we have to score more and more. That’s the only way we can really improve, developing that killer instinct.’ Chelsea can smother teams, a tactic Jose Mourinho has refined quite brilliantly over the years with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. Fabregas is eager to please his manager as he learns a new, more disciplined position alongside Nemanja Matic in the centre of midfield. Chelsea are hoping to build on their recent Capital One Cup triumph over Tottenham . Fabregas (right) is enjoying working under Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (second left) since signing . Fabregas loves his football at Chelsea, cheerfully claiming that he is at the top of his game following his move from Barcelona last summer. ‘I have to be more disciplined and you don’t see me in the box so much,’ he added. ‘I am more positional, always behind the ball, always finding solutions for the other players and controlling the tempo. ‘If you asked me 12 months ago whether I would work with Jose I would have said “no”, but you can never say never. ‘Working with Jose, it has been really good so far, but I expected that. I knew he was a great personality and I knew coming to Chelsea, a big club with a big manager, that I would work a lot. I have enjoyed this the most in my career. We need to keep growing as a team. ‘I will give everything for Chelsea to win the Champions League, but it doesn’t mean I can’t sleep at night. ‘For every football player they want to win the World Cup and the Champions League.’ Mourinho has revealed his admiration for Fabregas, pictured in 2006, during his younger years at Arsenal . Mourinho admired the Spain midfielder from afar when he was running the show for Arsenal. Fabregas played in the 2006 Champions League final, alongside Gilberto Silva when Arsenal were beaten by Barcelona after extra time in the Stade de France. He was in the centre of midfield that night, putting in an arduous shift in the boiler room because Arsenal were down to 10 after the dismissal of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. A year later he faced Chelsea in the Carling Cup final, unlucky to lose after a battle royal with some players of pedigree in Mourinho’s side. ‘As a kid he played against our midfield in the League Cup final in 2007 and we had (Michael) Essien, (Claude) Makelele, (Frank) Lampard and (Michael) Ballack, and he was playing fantastic football,’ said Mourinho. ‘I never felt he could work with me because when I was at Chelsea he was at Arsenal and when I was at Real Madrid he was at Barcelona. So it was quite unexpected for me that he wanted to come to Chelsea.’ Now that he is here, they wouldn’t be without him.

"Heather Watson battled her way into the second round of the BNP Paribas Open with a scrappy three-set win over Julia Goerges in Indian Wells. The British No 1 had not won on the WTA Tour since lifting the Hobart International title in January, but came through 6-4 5-7 6-3 against her German opponent. It should have been easier for Watson, who served for the match in the second set before losing the next five games, but the 22-year-old overcame the setback to seal a last-64 clash with 29th seed Camila Giorgi. Heather Watson celebrates after winning a point against Julia Georges in the first round at Indian Wells . Watson acknowledges the crowd after finally winning the match, after failing to serve out in the second set . The British No 1 was made to work for her win, and admitted she was nervous, but came through to progress . 'I was definitely a bit nervous, I think it showed closing out the second set there, but I kept fighting and was able to play the right way to finish the third set,' Watson told BT Sport 2. 'I just kept fighting. We both didn't play our best tennis but it was a good match.' In an opening set that featured seven breaks of serve, with neither player holding in the opening four games, Watson stole a march on Goerges in the 10th game to go ahead. Georges fought back bravely from a set and a break down, and led in the third set before Watson responded . In the end the Brit battled hard to win in three, and set up a match against Camila Giorgi . Both players seemed to find some composure as the second set went with serve until a fantastic cross-court forehand in the eighth game gave Watson a 5-3 lead. Goerges, though, capitalised on some loose play from Watson to take the next four games and force a decider. The world number 62 then broke at the start of the third, but Watson immediately levelled the match before then breaking decisively in the eighth game before closing out the match in two hours and 25 minutes.","Heather Watson took first set and served for the match in second .

"Reigning US Open Champion Marin Cilic is already looking ahead to Wimbledon and eyeing his next Grand Slam title. ‘Wimbledon is the first tournament I’ve got my eye on,’ said Cilic, who lost to Juan Monaco on Saturday night in Indian Wells in his first match of the year after a shoulder injury. ‘I’m going to try to peak my form for Wimbledon time.’ The world No 10 believes that the grass court credentials of his coach Goran Ivanisevic, who won the title in 2001, can help him conquer SW19. Marin Cilic was upset by Juan Monaco in the second round of the BNP Paribas Open in California . The Croatian star has set his sights on Wimbledon in his bid to win a second Grand Slam . ‘I believe having Goran in my corner, who has been known in history as one of the best grass court players ever, is a big plus. Wimbledon is a big target for me. ‘Even last year we approached the grass court tournaments differently. When I started to play last year I straight away felt better than before and I feel its going to be similar this year.’ Cilic had an excellent run at Wimbledon 2014, knocking out Tomas Berdych in straight sets before going down in five to Novak Djokovic and that run, coupled with his maiden slam title in Flushing Meadows in September, leaves him feeling confident that he can have a successful trip to London. Cilic is coached by compatriot Goran Ivanisevic who won the Wimbledon title in 2001 . Cilic holds aloft the US Open trophy after winning his first Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows last year . ‘I think I have a good chance of winning Wimbledon,’ said the 26-year-old. ‘In 2014 I played really well over there and lost to eventual champion Djokovic in a pretty close match. ‘I felt the best on the grass ever last year and that’s what’s giving the most confidence. And, with the experience of winning the US Open, I can carry that on into grand slam tournaments.’ The 6ft 6in Croat was speaking after his nomination for breakthrough sportsperson of the year at the 2015 Laureus World Sports Awards. He credits Ivanisevic for his superb 2014 season. ‘Goran was extremely hard working as a player and he still is,’ said Cilic. ‘We tried to push my game to be more aggressive, to play my own game rather than thinking about the tactics of the other guys. ‘He helped me a lot with my serve and in all areas he was a huge help. Goran knows tennis.’ Cilic reached the quarter finals at the Championships in 2014 before losing to eventual winner Novak Djokovic . Boris Becker is one of several 'supercoaches' taking charge of top players on the ATP Tour . Ivanisevic is part of the growing army of ‘supercoaches’ – well-known former players who are helping to guide a new generation. The trend was started by Andy Murray hiring Ivan Lendl, and Cilic believes that big-name players make the best coaches. ‘They know the game,’ he said. ‘They’ve been through many of the same situations in their own careers. Goran teaches me to not do the same mistakes he was doing during his career. It’s huge to have someone who has won a grand slam in your corner.’ He has matched his coach in winning a grand slam. He has matched his Laureus nomination (Ivanisevic won the 2002 comeback award). Now Cilic is ready to equal his mentor’s most famous achievement by winning the Wimbledon title.","Marin Cilic is chasing a second grand slam title at Wimbledon this year .

"Gareth Bale has been supported by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez after fans booed his performance against Schalke in the Champions League. Perez called a news conference on Thursday to back the former Tottenham forward, who has been made a scapegoat for Real’s poor recent form. In his first season in Spain the Welshman, 25, won the Champions League and scored the winner in the Spanish Cup final. And Perez said: ‘Gareth Bale is one of the best players in the world. The biggest clubs fought and continue to fight to secure his services. We shouldn’t forget what he was able to achieve in his first year at Real Madrid.’ Florentino Perez jumped to the defence of Real Madrid's world record signing Gareth Bale on Thursday . Perez labelled Gareth Bale 'one of the best  in the world' and said he is being chased by 'the biggest clubs' Perez claimed Real will also stand by coach Carlo Ancelotti, despite Tuesday’s 4-3 defeat by Schalke in the Bernabeu. He said: ‘To use the fact we are not on our best form to report information that is not true is unacceptable. The club has full confidence in our coach. Contrary to a report published today, Carlo Ancelotti will remain coach of Real Madrid.’ Meanwhile, Steven Gerrard insists there is no crisis in the Barclays Premier League and is adamant English clubs will return strongly in Europe. ‘It has not been our year but English clubs will come back,’ said Gerrard, who was speaking to launch an All-Star charity game that will be staged at Anfield on March 29. Madrid newspaper Marca ran with the headline: 'Not One More' and claimed the Italian was close to the sack . He added: ‘It is not a crisis. The teams will bounce back. Chelsea, Man City, Arsenal and ourselves will make signings and come back stronger.’ Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, who will captain the other All-Star side, feels there has been a deterioration in Premier League standards.

Pogba, who was allowed to leave United by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012 after failing to sign a contract with the club, scored a stunning volley from the edge of the box to give Juventus a 1-0 win over Sassuolo. The 82nd-minute goal put the 'Old Lady' 11 points clear at the top of Serie A, and keeps them on course for a fourth straight title. In Portugal it was Nani - still technically a United player - who popped up for the winning goal for Sporting Lisbon in their 3-2 win over Panafiel. Paul Pogba unleashes a superb 82nd minute volley which won Juventus the game against Sassuolo . The Frenchman used to be at United, but was allowed to leave after playing just three league games . Pogba has become a vital part of a Juventus side on course to win yet another Italian title this season . Van Gaal has reportedly not spoken to the Portuguese winger since he was allowed to leave Old Trafford, but Nani showed he still has the quality to make the difference when it matters. Down to ten men, Sporting had let a two-goal lead slip before Nani arrived to score a diving header and secure all three points against the Portuguese league's bottom side. The win keeps Nani's side in the hunt to qualify for next season's Champions League, something Van Gaal's United look increasingly unlikely to do. But none of those will hurt as much as Danny Welbeck's strike on Monday night, which was not only another winner from an ex-United player, but also against his former club. Nani celebrates after scoring the winner for 10-man Sporting Lisbon in a 3-2 win over Penafiel . The Portuguese winger was allowed to leave on loan after Louis van Gaal decided he was not needed . Unlike the Frenchman Pogba or the Portuguese Nani, Welbeck is a product of United's academy. But after Van Gaal deemed him not good enough for Old Trafford - preferring expensive flop Radamel Falcao to warm the subs bench - the 24-year-old proved he can still score at the Theatre of Dreams. On Monday, United could have done with the composure, bravery and quality shown by Welbeck, Nani and Pogba - but all three had been allowed  to leave. All three players were allowed to leave Old Trafford, and have done well elsewhere since moving .","Danny Welbeck scored the winner for Arsenal against Manchester United .

"With their tiny pink noses, soft furry coats and sleepy eyes, these two clouded leopard cubs are simply adorable. The highly endangered kittens, which are both female, were born at Zoo Miami in Florida just three weeks ago, a treat for the facility's doting keepers. They are currently being held in an enclosure with their mother, Serai, to 'avoid any external stress and allow the mother to properly bond with them'.

The tiny cats, which are yet to be named, already sport the clouded leopard's characteristic large, dark and cloud-like spots on a light background. Their birth is a victory in the fight to preserve a vulnerable species, which is not closely related to the African leopard. 'Both offspring are doing well and the mother continues to be attentive and nurse them on a regular basis,' the zoo told AP on Monday. Visitors should be able to view the kittens in the coming weeks. The clouded leopard, which is medium sized, lives in forests of South East Asia. In total, fewer than 10,000 are thought to exist in the wild.

"Salvadoran soccer players were left baffled ahead of their match against Argentina in Washington D.C. on Saturday after the stadium played the wrong national anthem. Rather than pressing play on 'Himno Nacional de El Salvador', staff at the stadium switched on 'Arrane Ashoonagh Vannin' - an anthem belonging to the Isle of Man, USA Today reported. A video of the awkward moment shows the players looking at each other and slowly removing their hands from their chests before turning to walk off the pitch. Scroll down for video .

"Steve McClaren would cost Newcastle United around £2million in compensation if the club were to appoint him as their next boss. As reported by Sportsmail in January, Newcastle will make Derby County’s McClaren their No 1 managerial target in the summer. No approach has yet been made to Derby, who remain in contention for promotion and the work done by McClaren has attracted admirers. Steve McClaren would cost Newcastle United £2million in compensation if they chose to approach him . He signed a new three-year contract in August, and Derby would command a significant sum for his services should he depart. Chief executive Sam Rush said on Monday: ‘We have not had any approach, discussion or communication of any sort, whatsoever. ‘Whether it is speculation about your manager or players, you are likely to have this sort of thing if people are being successful. John Carver's chances of earning the permanent job seemed doomed if he doesn't improve his results . ‘Traditionally, it is more likely to be with players, but I think the job Steve has done here has been significant. The position from Steve has been very consistent. ‘He was only three or four months into his new contract when the speculation first came out, and he dismissed it then. From my point of view, I think Derby County is an incredibly exciting football club. I can’t think of anywhere anyone would rather be, especially given the start of the building programme Steve has undertaken and how well he has done.’ Meanwhile, Newcastle have announced record profits of £18.7m for last season, but fans say the figure has provoked more questions than answers. Mike Ashley will be pleased to see Newcastle have announced record profits of £18.7million for last season . The club have not released the full annual report, only selecting highlights with no detailed explanation as to how £28.5m of extra costs have been incurred. Mark Jensen, editor of online fanzine themag.co.uk, said he had expected profits for the 2013-14 campaign to be closer to £50m given the increase in income from television rights and the sale of Yohan Cabaye to Paris Saint-Germain for around £20million. Jensen said: ‘Everyone knows how much these clubs are getting from TV, so Newcastle fans would like to think more profit would mean more team strengthening but that has not been the case. There seems to be both a lack of transparency and ambition.’ Fan favourite Yohan Cabaye was sold to Paris Saint-Germain for £20million in last seasons January window .","Steve McClaren would cost Newcastle United £2million in compensation .

"The sports presenter dubbed the Mexican Kim Kardashian says she's 'embarrassed' to be compared to the social media queen because she does more than 'just post photos online'. Jimena Sanchez, who has garnered a following of more than a million Twitter and Instagram admirers for her raunchy posts on social media, said: 'Kim doesn't seem to do anything. My ideals are completely different than Kim Kardashian's'. The presenter on the Spanish-language FOX Sports channel told MailOnline in Mexico City: 'It's surprising that Kim and her sisters have become so famous given that none of them have any special talents.'

I dedicate my life to other things, I don't think we're anything alike'. Miss Sanchez is smaller than she appears in her now-famous selfies - standing at just 5ft 5ins – and walks with the bouncy gait she has been noted for during her energetic performances on FOX. She plays constantly with her hair and pouts her lips almost instinctively as she listens to other people speak. Jimena, who describes herself as the 'sexy girl' of Mexican television, says she is passionate about sport and that being a professional journalist is what makes her different from the style-icon she is compared to. 'I love my job and I'm good at it,' she said. 'Physically we may be alike, but we aren't similar professionally.' Despite not enjoying be likened to Kim, Jimena nevertheless admits there are certain aspects which are undeniably similar - and is obviously pleased with the publicity the comparison has brought.

That has made me the Mexican Kim Kardashian more than anything else. 'We are both popular because of our looks, and we're both very active on social media, so it's difficult not to draw comparisons, I just didn't think it was going to become such a big deal'. When asked whether she is after the social media queen's crown, Jimena replied: 'It would be nice.' But Jimena still has some way to go, with just under a million Twitter followers compared to Kim's thirty million. 'It's much more difficult to get followers in Mexico,' she complained. 'People here aren't as switched on technologically as they are in the US.' Jimena said she has doubts about whether Kim is a good role model for young girls.

'I didn't know what to do at first, so just like everyone else who doesn't have anything to do, I started studying acting,' she laughed. 'I very nearly finished the course, but social media was coming out at the time and I was much more interested in that. I have always loved taking photos of myself and sharing them with other people'. After dropping out of drama school, Jimena launched her Mad Mamacitas photo blog alongside best friend Hannah Sotelo - a website which quickly caught the attention of many internet users.

Despite photos which seem to be copied directly from Kardashian's photo feed, Jimena claims she has no style icons. 'There's no one I really admire in terms of style,' she said. 'I make my own style by using the things I like. Generally in my Instagram photos I appear very messy.' Jimena receives a lot of abuse from internet trolls, many of whom question her romantic choices, particularly her ex-boyfriend, Mexican television presenter Faisy Omar.

But for the moment I'm concentrating on the television. I'm very happy in my job'. 'As for being like Kim, she looks happy in her reality television shows, but I'm not sure I'd want to live like her.

"Diego Maradona appears to have patched things up with his 24-year-old girlfriend as the pair were spotted strolling through Vienna on Saturday just months after he allegedly hit her. The scruffily-attired ex-footballer was seen walking arm-in-arm with on-off partner Rocio Oliva, with the blonde pictured leaning on his shoulder affectionately. Just five months ago, he was labelled a 'psychopath' after video footage emerged which appeared to show him assaulting Ms Oliva. Scroll down for video . Forgive and forget: Maradona and his on-off girlfriend Rocio Oliva, 24, were pictured strolling through Vienna on Saturday just months after she filmed him allegedly assaulting her . In the video, Maradona, who captained Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986 before managing the side with less success, can be seen getting up from his sofa and approaching his Ms Oliva to berate her for using her mobile phone. Oliva filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone?' She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand. Following the video's release, the former footballer played down the incident insisting he had only knocked the phone out of her hands. Scruffy attire: The 54-year-old ex-footballer looked less than smart as he walked through the Austrian capital . Backing royal: Maradona and Miss Oliva were in Vienna to meet Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein (left), who they are backing to become the next president of Fifa . He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there.' Two weeks later the couple appeared to be in better spirits as Maradona was filmed serenading Ms Oliva with an impromptu love song in Dubai. Maradona, whose notorious Hand of God goal helped Argentina knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, has been dating Ms Oliva on and off since the beginning of 2013. Also with the pair in Vienna on Saturday was Jordanian royal Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, who Maradona is backing to become the next president of Fifa. He is convinced the Jordanian deserves to win the presidency and says he will not be an 'advocate for corruption', suggesting he does not want current president Sepp Blatter to win another term.

"Marouane Fellaini struck twice as Belgium moved within three points of Euro 2016 Group B qualifying leaders Wales with a 5-0 thumping of Cyprus on Saturday. After a win and two draws from their first three matches, Belgium knew the pressure was on to produce a performance befitting a side ranked fourth in the world. 'The players enjoyed themselves and knew what to do. Yes, I'm satisfied,' Belgian coach Marc Wilmots told reporters. Marouane Fellaini celebrates after scoring for Belgium in their European qualifier against Cyprus . Christian Benteke (right) is congratulated after scoring the second goal in Belgium's win over Cyprus .

The hosts, who reached the quarter-finals of last year's World Cup, were 2-0 up at halftime although they could easily have been four or five ahead against a packed but often porous Cypriot defence. Manchester United midfielder Fellaini opened Belgium's account midway through the first half after the visitors failed to clear a corner. A cross by Eden Hazard then set up Christian Benteke to make it 2-0 in the 35th minute. Fellaini found the top corner with a perfectly placed long-range strike in the 66th minute but that effort was matched a minute later by Hazard. With two defenders in front of him, the Chelsea playmaker shifted cleverly to the right before curling the ball into the net off the inside of the far post. Debutant Michy Batshuayi completed the demolition in the 80th minute after the hard-working Radja Nainggolan dispossessed a defender. Fellaini is congratulated by his Belgium team-mates after scoring the opening goal of the night . Vincent Kompany (left) and Fellaini celebrate after the latter got the ball rolling against Cyprus on Saturday . Cyprus, who beat Bosnia 2-1 in September, were without six injured players and barely mounted an attack with a single off-target header in the second half proving their only threat. 'We lost to the better team. Belgium is one of the best in the world,' said Cyprus coach Charalambos Christodoulou. 'We have to forget this game.

"Catherine Emberton, 28, sold endangered tiger teeth and claws from the British Raj days . A jeweller who sold endangered tiger teeth and claws from the British Raj days on eBay has been spared jail. Catherine Emberton, 28, advertised hundreds of pieces from her home in Sheffield including cufflinks and a pendant from the 1880s, which were described as 'Victorian hunting trophies'. She pleaded guilty to three offences under the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations at Sheffield Crown Court. The silversmith, who traded on eBay under the name 'Gypsy Silver', was handed a 12-month community order and ordered her to carry out 120 hours of unpaid community work. Police and officers from the Wildlife Crime Unit raided her home last June and recovered tiger teeth,  claws and jewellery making materials. She advertised 129 items containing derivatives of tiger from November 2012 to June 2014 and during that time her business had a turnover of £17,360, the court heard. Emberton claimed the jewellery pre-dated 1947 regulations banning the sale of tiger derivatives as the items were classed as 'antique' because they were more than 50 years old. But scientific officers who examined photos of the jewellery said the items had not been significantly altered from their natural state and so were not exempt of the regulations. They said it was also impossible to tell purely by looking at the teeth or claws whether they were tiger or another creature and that could only be done by radio carbon dating. Prosecutor Richard Thyne said: 'She did not make reasonable inquiries as to the provenance of the items she was selling or make inquiries as to the law on the trade of endangered species.' Emberton accepted she had not made detailed inquiries to verify the origin of the pieces and 90 per cent were already in settings when she bought them, the vast majority from antique markets. She believed the items she sold were exempted from the regulations. Peter Pimm, for the defence highlighted the fact that she had only made a 'modest profit' out of her business. 'The last thing she wants to do is to make a profit from endangered species that is not her motive,' said Mr Pimm. She advertised hundreds of pieces of jewellery from her home in Sheffield dating back to the days of the British Raj in India . She sold cufflinks and a pendant from the 1880s, which were described as 'Victorian hunting trophies' 'The idea of trading in endangered species is complete anathema to her. You have got to rely on your wits, knowledge and experience and that's what she did. What she didn't do was read the guidance.' Judge Robert Moore ordered  the forfeiture and destruction of all the jewellery seized. He said: 'You are fundamentally a good person. This is not a case of fraudulent or dishonest selling of items derived from endangered species if it had been the sentence would have been immediate custody and substantial.' 'Anybody selling jewellery based on endangered species needs to check the precise law.' Speaking after  the hearing Emberton said: 'I feel the investigators should be going after the real villains and not people like me. 'They could stop people trading on eBay in endangered species derivatives tomorrow if the site complied.' Andy McWilliam, investigations officer for the National Wildlife Crime Unit said: 'Anybody who chooses to trade in endangered species has a duty to know the law. 'The illegal trade feeds the marketplace and is a threat to these species in the wild.' Police and officers from the Wildlife Crime Unit raided her home last June and recovered tiger teeth, claws and jewellery making materials .

'As ever we do want to get better and Mark has aspirations to get higher up the table and we want to support him in doing that.

"Alan Pardew believes English football is not doing enough to include black coaches – and wants to see more ethnic minorities in top jobs in the Barclays Premier League. Pardew’s Crystal Palace side face Queens Park Rangers at Selhurst Park in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off, and the visitors have the top flight’s only black manager in Chris Ramsey. QPR appointed Ramsey last month unexpectedly after Harry Redknapp left the club, and Pardew believes the appointment was a great boost for the Premier League. Palace manager Alan Pardew believes that English football isn't doing enough to include black coaches . Chris Ramsey, QPR boss, is the only black coach in the top flight - and one of just six in the Football League . ‘He’s black, which I think is great for the Premier League,’ Pardew said. 'We’ve got a black manager, and it’s something that I want to promote here in terms of our coaches, because the percentage of players we have to percentage of coaches in terms of origin isn’t right. ‘So I’m pleased (he got the role), I hope he does well, he’s done a terrific job so far because that QPR team has improved under his tutorage, though hopefully not improved too much tomorrow otherwise we’re going to be in trouble.’ And Pardew said he feels the entire English game needs to work on being more inclusive in the people it hires. Ramsey takes a coaching session at the QPR training ground this week ahead of his side's trip to Palace . Former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is currently managing League Two outfit Burton Albion . Ramsey is one of just six black or ethnic minorities bosses in the Football League, along with Huddersfield Town boss Chris Powell, Brighton’s Chris Hughton, Carlisle manager Keith Curle, Leyton Orient boss Fabio Liverani and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink with Burton Albion. ‘I think it’s just important to promote coaches. The proportion of African, Afro-Caribbean players to coaches is not right,’ Pardew said. ‘I think it’s something that needs to be spoken about and something that we need to work on as an FA and the chairmen up and down the country need to give more chances.’ ‘I actually do feel that a lot of black players or Afro-Caribbean players don’t go into the coaching courses. Perhaps they feel it’s not going to help them, but it will. ‘We need a greater influx of Indians, Afro-Caribbeans, entering our coaching system and getting jobs, so the proportion makes sense.’","Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace face QPR on Saturday, managed by the only black coach in the Premier League - Chris Ramsey .
