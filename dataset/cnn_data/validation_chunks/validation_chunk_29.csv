"Sometimes getting a bit of peace and quiet can prove impossible - especially with annoying housemates to contend with, as this new video shows. Russian YouTube user Vladlena Tkachenko filmed  her giant St. Bernard dog attempting to get a nap as he was licked and sniffed by his tiny kitten friend. The sleepy canine is seen rolling his eyes in annoyance before stopping the feline in its tracks with his large paw. The little cat wags its tail as it remains momentarily trapped. A child watching the scene is heard laughing in the background. After the kitten manages to wriggle free it sits still, looking a little dazed and confused. However, it soon goes back to annoying its dog friend, pawing him in the eyes and rubbing up against his face. At one point the infant animal takes to nibbling the St Bernard's droopy jowls. The canine throws a look of disdain at the camera. It appears sometime a bit of peace and quiet can be too much to ask...

"Playwright Alan Bennett, who has said that England is a nation of hypocrites and that English are 'better than all the rest' at setting double standards . We are a nation famed the world over for conquest, industry – and of course a good cup of tea. But according to playwright Alan Bennett, what England really excels at is ‘hypocrisy.’ The writer made the astonishing attack as part of a milestone series celebrating the 50th anniversary of BBC Radio 4’s World at One. In each edition, the participants are asked to nominate what they believe to be one of Britain’s world-class achievements. Mr Bennett, 80, said he toyed with the idea of suggesting the National Trust, medieval churches or the impressive landscape of Swaledale. But in an interview with Martha Kearney, to be broadcast today, he says he believes that what the English are ‘better than all the rest’ at is setting double standards. He said: ‘In England, what we do best is lip service. Take London; we extol its beauty and its dignity while at the same time we’re happy to sell it off to the highest bidder. Or highest builder. We glory in Shakespeare yet we close our public libraries. ‘A substantial minority of our children receive a better education than the rest because of the social situation of the parents. ‘Then we wonder why things at the top do not change or society improve. But we know why. It’s because we are hypocrites.’ He went on to claim that too often, the English are lazy in their assumptions that problems which affect other countries do not exist in their own, saying: ‘Our policemen are wonderful, provided you’re white and middle class and don’t take to the streets. ‘And dying in custody is what happens in South America. It doesn’t happen here.’ He added: ‘A memorable phrase in Hamlet, and one of the few that hasn’t been picked up as a quotation or a title for something else, is when Claudius is arranging for Hamlet to be arrested and executed when he gets to our shores. As part of his explanation, the writer says that policeman in England are wonderful, 'provided you're white and middle class and don't take to the streets' (file picture) And in his letter he says; “Do it England”. And we say we do it, or we’re going to do it, but we don’t. Scotland does it. And Wales. But not England.’ He was careful not to exempt himself from his own criticism, saying: ‘Before you stampede for the Basildon Bond, or rather skitter for the Twitter, I must say that I don’t exempt myself from these strictures. How should I? I am English, I am a hypocrite.’ In January the World at One heard nominations from the Prime Minister David Cameron and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband and other party leaders. World at One was first broadcast on 4 October 1965 on the Home Service and was presented by William Hardcastle.","Writer made attack on England in series on BBC Radio 4's World at One .

"A Missouri man is dead after a fatal shooting involving a police officer on Saturday. This is the seventh fatal shooting in the area since Michael Brown was gunned down by Ferguson cop Darren Wilson sparking national unrest, reports The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Police say the shooting happened when an officer pulled a car over at the corner of Morton and Page avenues at 10:15 a.m. Thomas Allen Jr. 34, was shot while driving this car as a police officer 'in fear for his life' was taken along for a ride after a routine stop . While the driver was being questioned, another passenger - Thomas Allen Jr. of St. Louis - is reported to have climbed into the driver's seat and tried to drive off. The officer got into the car and tried fighting with Allen and, 'in fear for his life,' shot the man three times. Fox 2 Now reports one of those shots struck Allen in the neck. The car then jumped a curb coming to a stop behind a home. Allen was transported to a hospital in critical condition - he later died. The Crimes Against Persons Unit is investigating the shooting . The officer was also taken to the hospital for treatment. The Crimes Against Persons Unit is now investigating the incident. The shooting comes just as the Justice Department is set to release a report accusing police in Ferguson, Missouri, of racist behavior that fueled tensions in the city for years before Michael Brown was shot dead. Officers ticketed black citizens above all others in regular traffic stops that were used to boost the department's coffers, senior officials connected to the report told The New York Times. Those unable to pay the fines would be jailed, creating a perpetual and 'avoidable' cycle that ghettoized the African-American community. A racist joke circulated via email among police officers will also be featured in the report to emphasize an overarching attitude that had a 'disparate impact' on black people, it is claimed. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, officer are under fire for shooting a homeless man dead on the sidewalk in broad daylight. In a video posted online, four officers are seen standing over the victim, who was sat among sleeping bags and tents in Skid Row, downtown LA. While two police detain his female friend, another can be heard shouting: 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!' Five gun shots are then fired and the man lies lifeless, face down.","St. Louis County Police confirmed that Thomas Allen Jr., 34, died of his injuries at the hospital Sunday .

They performed CPR but were unable to revive the teacher. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Students at El Dorado High first identified her on Twitter as Jillian Jacobson, a 31-year-old photography teacher. Authorities confirmed her identity Monday afternoon. A student witness told the LA Times about screams emanating from the classroom when the tragic discovery was made. Frank Leon, 16, said his teacher left to unlock Jacobson's classroom and he heard 'screaming, crying. It freaked the hell out of me.' He added that his teacher was screaming, 'Oh my God, oh my God!' Assistant Superintendent Kevin Lee with Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District says classes were dismissed for the day at 11am . He also confirmed there there was an 'emergency medical situation' involving a teacher. Crisis counselors have been made available on campus.

"Choosing the perfect ski destination can be a tricky prospect. Especially if you want to take your family. The first instinct is to think about the Alps. But if you want to go away in February half-term - which we did - then the snowiest parts of France, Italy and Austria can be busy. And a little expensive. We happened upon an alternative. Norway. Fill your snow boots: Norway can be an inexpensive alternative to the Alps . The slopes are snow-sure well into April, prices are reasonable and families are exceptionally well catered for. My wife and I have two children, Maisie, five and Imogen, three. That's young to start skiing, but I was told that Trysil would do the trick. After an easy transfer from Oslo airport, we arrived at the Radisson Blu, one of two ski-in ski-out hotels. There is ten-pin bowling, an American-style diner, a soft play area and a vast multi-pool swimming area that would prove to be a huge hit with my lot. It is also right by the nursery slopes - our first morning found us riding the magic carpet to ski school. Maisie was in a class of five, Imogen was with three others. And by a happy quirk, they were being taught by two sisters, both delightful. By the second day, she was riding the mini drag lift and Imogen was padding around on her skis, searching for stuffed toy lions and monkeys around the kids area. Easy does it: Trysil can be a perfect ski destination for families with young children . By the end of the week, both were skiing better than I could have hoped. Trysil has four main ski areas, all with excellent nursery slopes - with easy routes down from all points. The ski school also runs a drop-in creche from 10.45am to 3pm for £8 an hour per child, with a 30 per cent discount for siblings. We used this for our own ski time. The slopes are surprisingly extensive. Hogegga is an area with mostly black runs - and new for this season is the first of a series of new gladed trails through woods. Skihytta is a charming mountain hut serving its own beers, and moose shot by the owner. Knettsettra is another must-visit mid-mountain restaurant and bar. It hosts free concerts for up to 5,000 people in March and April. The one sting in the tail is the cost of alcohol. A draft half-litre of beer cost me £6.50 and a bottle of wine £35. But the well-priced food balanced this out over the week. And it was not just about the skiing. Downhill all the way: Trysil has slopes for skiers all abilities, within quick reach of Oslo . We also took the girls dog-sledding across a beautifully scenic plateau, and our highlight of the week was a horse sleigh ride with a stop-off in a Nordic yurt to cook hot dogs over an open fire. The girls definitely developed a taste for skiing, and we have a new love affair with Trysil. We are already thinking about going back for half-term next year. Roll on February 2016. Ski Safari (01273 224 068, www.skisafari.com) offers holidays for a family of four (two adults, two children) from £3,100, based on a seven-night stay at the 4*+ Radisson Blu Resort on a half-board basis - including flights and transfers. Packages are now on sale for February 2016 half-term. Children's ski hire costs £30 for a week; a five-day package of 90-minute group lessons costs £100. Children under six ski free. A one-week adult ski pass costs £160.","Norway can be an alternative to the Alps for a half-term skiing break .

"A serial fraudster managed to con prison guards into letting him walk free from jail by sending them emails from the ‘courts service’ demanding his release. Neil Moore, 28, set up a fake website and sent emails purporting to be from the courts service to trick Wandsworth Prison into thinking he had been freed on bail by a judge. However, the ‘consummate and practiced’ conman appeared to have a ‘change of heart’ just three days after his release and was re-arrested after informing his solicitor of his actions. Neil Moore, 28, walked out of  Wandsworth Prison (pictured) in March after setting up a fake website and sending emails purporting to be from the courts service to trick guards into thinking he had been freed on bail . Moore, of Ilford, north east London, had originally been jailed for an elaborate web of frauds which saw him posing as bank staff to dupe major organisations into handing over more than £1million. He pretended to be employed by RBS, Lloyds bank, and Bank of America to dupe companies into handing over money. Cambia Autos was conned out of £46,000 in November 2013, Thomas Global Exchange handed over £140,000 to Moore, TD Banking gave up $120,751, and Hogan and Vest was duped out of $739,439 in 2012 and 2013. Moore also targeted Volkswagen by posing as an employee of the Bank of New York in December 2013. Ian Paton, prosecuting, described Moore as a ‘consummate and practiced’ fraudster. ‘He [Moore] acquired bail forms that he adapted for his purposes,’ he said. Moore's transgender wife, Kristen Angel, 27, was at Southwark Crown Court today to support her partner . Moore had carried out the cons over the phone, leading investigators to suspect his transgender wife, Kristen Angel Moore, 27, of being involved as well, but the fraud charges against her were dropped. The couple are in a civil partnership but Mrs Moore has been unable to visit her partner in prison because of her transgender status. Moore admitted five counts of fraud at Southwark Crown Court today and planned to deny a further charge of unlawful escape and have it thrown out. However, when the prosecution said his case was almost ‘unanswerable’ Moore decided to change his plea on the latter charge to guilty. Judge John Price had said of Moore’s anxiety to press on with the case: ‘He can have his argument [dismissal of the count], but the defendant knows what he did or didn’t do.’ Moore had been in custody  since January 21 last year and devised the escape plan from his cell. He successfully designed a fake website and sent emails purporting to be from the court service alleging he was legible for bail. On March 10, he collected his belongings and simply walked out of Wandsworth where murderers and rapists are held. At today's hearing, Judge Price ordered reports before sentencing Moore and said: ‘It is obviously going to be prison, but it’s important to know more about you.’ Afterwards, Met Police detective inspector Chris Soole said: ‘This is a very intelligent fraudster. ‘He was very apt at committing a number of different frauds across the globe. ‘This shows the Metropolitan Police’s commitment to investigating fraud and ensuring justice for the victims.’","Neil Moore set up a fake website and duped prison staff into releasing him .

"Two young men who built a mysterious tunnel in Toronto had no criminal intent - they just wanted a man cave, police said Monday. Const. Victor Kwong said tips from the public helped them identify the two men in their 20s responsible for building the underground chamber near a Pan Am Games venue. News of the tunnel's discovery set off a social media frenzy, with theories of its purpose ranging from zombie hideouts to affordable housing. Kwong said the two men just wanted to have fun and there was never any danger to public safety. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Authorities said this image reveals the tunnel's entrance, as well as a sump pump water hose and an electric extension cord . Good times: Toronto police said the tunnel, seen following an excavation, was built for fun . Puzzle: News of the tunnel's discovery set off a social media frenzy, with theories of its purpose ranging from zombie hideouts to affordable housing . Const. Victor Kwong said the two men just wanted to have fun and there was never any danger to public safety . 'It was a place for them to hang out. They started out as goal to make a cool place and that's what they did,' Kwong said. He said investigators checked out their explanation and the case is now closed. He said the men will not be charged, though they could face a fine. The bunker, discovered in January by a conservation officer in a densely wooded area, is located 25 meters (27 yards) from the fence of the Rexall Centre, which is to host tennis events for the Pan Am Games. Inside, police said they found beverage containers, plywood wall supports, a generator and a sump pump. The chamber was almost 2 meters (2 yards) high, 86 centimeters (34 inches) wide and 10 meters (33 feet) long. Kwong said police are not releasing the men's names, or any further details since the case is not a criminal investigation. Kwong said the men are not believed to be survivalists, adding they just 'wanted to dig a tunnel.' He said they were not ex-miners or engineers. Investigation: Kwong said police are not releasing the names of the men who built the tunnel, or any further details since the case is not a criminal investigation . Discreet: Toronto police say this is what was used to cover the tunnel . Prepping: A compressor (left) and a generator pit (right) were also at the tunnel site in Toronto . 'The minute they were found they were apologetic,' Kwong said. He said there is no connection to this summer's Pan Am Games, or to York University, which is also near the site where the tunnel was found. 'With the enormous interest generated by the media, police received information on Friday, February 27, 2015, which enabled investigators to identify two men,' Toronto police said in a Tuesday news release. It continued 'The two men told investigators they built the tunnel for personal reasons. Investigators have verified their account and are satisfied there was neither criminal intent nor any threat to the people or city of Toronto. The investigation is concluded.' Speaking to CBC News, Kwong said 'So, when we say ""personal reasons,"" what we basically mean is that it was not for any type of nefarious, nothing in terms of, you know, ritual or anything like that. 'It is simply two guys who just wanted to dig a cave. And that really is the - I mean, it sounds too simplified, but that really is what our investigation has led to.' He also told the news outlet 'Although we're not getting into details about them, what we can say is that they were not related to Rexall. Not related to Pan Am. Nor were they related to York University. 'These are just two men who decided that they wanted to embark upon this adventure.' Toronto police announced the discovery of the tunnel on Feb. 24 after weeks of surveillance didn't turn up anything. Safety: Kwong said the tunnel has no connection to this summer's Pan Am Games, or to York University, which is also near the site where the tunnel was found . Identities: Kwong said the men are not believed to be survivalists, adding they just 'wanted to dig a tunnel.'

"Natalia Revuelta Clews, the Cuban socialite who emptied her bank account and sold her diamond jewelry to support Fidel Castro when he was a little-known insurgent, has died at age 89. Ms Revuelta, who first caught the eye of the young revolutionary in 1952, opened her home for Castro to plot a barracks assault the following year that is considered the start of the revolution. They later had an affair that produced a daughter, Alina, 59, who as an adult became a harsh critic of the communist leader from exile in Florida. Natalia Revuelta Clews died at the age of 89 on Friday. The green-eyed socialite (pictured in 2003 standing in front of a painting of her youth) supported the insurgency of Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution . Carmen Garcia, Ms Revuelta's caretaker, told The Associated Press that Ms Revuelta died Friday and had been cremated in a private family ceremony. Ms Revuelta's longtime friend Natalia Bolivar, a renowned anthropologist, said Ms Revuelta had been ill after a fall. She suffered a stroke in 2014, according to El Nuevo Herald. Her family could not be reached for comment. She was 'one of the most exquisitely beautiful women in Cuba and a woman with an abnormally sensuous appetite for revolution and adventure,' Georgie Anne Geyer wrote in her biography of Castro, 'Guerrilla Prince.' Born Dec 6, 1925, 'Naty' Revuelta was an only child whose parents divorced when she was a toddler. Her mother remarried when she was 10, to an executive at the US-owned Havana Electric Company. She attended the American-run Ruston Academy in Havana and Mt St. Joseph's Academy, a Catholic girls' school in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania. She also studied business at Marjorie Webster College in Washington before returning to Cuba at 19, working first for the US Embassy and later for Standard Oil. Ms Revuelta was 22 when she married heart surgeon Orlando Fernandez, nearly 20 years her senior. She gave birth to a daughter, Nina, and became a fixture of Havana's social scene. She belonged to the Havana Country Club, played in weekly bridge and tennis tournaments and often lunched at a yacht club. 'Blonde, green-eyed, buxom and always in exuberant spirits, Naty was the kind of woman who stopped eyes and tongues when she entered a room,' Geyer wrote in 'Guerrilla Prince.' But Ms Revuelta was restless. Her husband worked long hours and she was tired of floating from one cocktail party to another, according to Wendy Gimble's 1998 biography, 'Havana Dreams.' Ms Revuelta (left in 2003) and Castro (right, in 1955) became lovers after he was released from prison . The result of Castro and Ms Revuelta's union was daughter Anna Fernandez, born in 1955, who has become a fierce critic of her father. She later fled the island in 1993 (pictured) with a false Spanish passport . She was also unfulfilled by motherhood. Ms Revuelta began attending meetings of the Orthodox Party, which opposed corruption in the government. At the time, Castro, then without his now-famous beard, was married to Mirta Diaz-Balart, whom he met while studying law at the University of Havana. He first laid eyes on Ms Revuelta at a protest marking the anniversary of the 1871 slaying of independence-minded medical students by Spanish soldiers. Castro dispatched a mutual friend who introduced the pair. A few days later, the same friend approached Ms Revuelta, wanting to know if Castro could drop by her house. 'Of course,' she replied. 'After five o'clock, I'm always home.' 'He was the kind of person who couldn't be ignored. If he was in a room, people paid attention to him,' Revuelta told US News and World Report in 1999. 'I too had a certain charm of my own.' Castro was briefly jailed soon after for leading an underground movement against strongman Fulgencio Batista, and he didn't turn up at Ms Revuelta's for months. But after he did, her home became a key planning area for the attack on the Moncada army barracks in eastern Cuba. Ms Revuelta was 'one of an extraordinary contingent of beautiful and/or highly intelligent women who, in effect, dedicated their lives to (Castro) and his cause,' Tad Szulc wrote in Fidel: A Critical Portrait. She handed over all of her savings of 6,000 pesos — then worth the same amount in dollars — to support his movement, and later pawned her sapphires, emeralds and diamond jewelry for his cause. She sewed fatigues for his rebels to wear, and delivered Castro's uprising manifesto to top Havana newspaper editors. Ms Fernandez (left) went back to Cuba for the first time in years last August after her mother became seriously ill (file photo) Ms Revuelta, who had plans on becoming First Lady of Cuba, said she wasn't bitter that Castro (pictured in the 1960s), put his revolutionary project ahead of his personal life . The 1953 barracks assault failed, with most of the rebels killed and the rest captured. Ms Revuelta wrote to Castro frequently when he was in prison. She sent him scores of books by Dostoevsky, Freud, and Hugo and an envelope of sand to remind him of the beach. Castro's prison love letters to Ms Revuelta are one of the few glimpses into his closely guarded emotional side: 'I am on fire. Write to me, for I cannot be without your letters,' he wrote in 1954. 'I have been meaning to ask you for several days now to stop using the typewriter once . in a while and write longhand . . . I love your handwriting, so delicate, feminine, unmistakable,' he wrote. The rebel and Diaz-Balart divorced, in part because one of his letters to Ms Revuelta was mistakenly delivered to his wife. Castro was freed, and he and Ms Revuelta became lovers for what she said was the first time. She became pregnant, though she didn't tell Castro until after he had fled to Mexico later that year. Castro then asked Ms Revuelta to come to Mexico and marry him, but she refused, convinced he would not survive. Alina was born in March 1956, six months before Castro returned to Cuba and took to the Sierra Maestra mountains. Castro did not recognize his daughter, and Ms Revuelta's estranged husband gave her his last name. The future Cuban leader eventually told Alina at 12 she could become a Castro, but by then she didn't want to, according to her memoir. Castro's rarely seen emotional side is visible in letters to Ms Revuelta from prison in which he says he is 'on fire.' Above, the former president meets Cuban spies returned in a deal with the US . Ms Revuelta said that ''it took many years' to get Castro out of her heart because he was omnipresent on state television and print media . After Castro's forces toppled Batista, Revuelta quietly began preparing for a role as Cuba's first lady — but it was not meant to be, as Castro kept his distance. She and her husband divorced in 1959, and he took their daughter Nina to the United States. Ms Revuelta never remarried, lost her home to nationalization and became active in Cuba's new civilian militias. Alina Fernandez Revuelta fled the island in 1993 disguised as a Spanish tourist — an escape Revuelta only learned about from US radio reports — and later wrote articles blasting his communist government. In August 2014, Ms Fernandez Revuelta returned to Cuba for the first time to see her ailing mother, the Miami Herald reported. Though her contact with Castro was minimal through the years, Ms Revuelta remained in Cuba and was a regular at embassy cocktail parties, stylish and bejeweled with her ever-present gold-plated cigarette case. In 2008, Revuelta told the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia that she was never bitter that Castro 'put his revolutionary project ahead of his personal life.' The beauty said that it was difficult to avoid him, given that he was constantly on the television 'everywhere, every day.' She said, 'it took many years to get him out of my heart.' The former Cuban president, 88, now only makes infrequent public appearances, and has been rumored as deceased several times. He recently met with members of the Cuban Five spies, who had been held in Miami since 1998 until a recent warming in relations between the US and Cuba led to the release of three. Castro has at least seven other children with three other women. He resigned as president in 2008. His brother Raul now holds the post and announced a landmark deal with the President Barack Obama in December.","Natalia Revuelta Clews sold her diamonds to support Cuban insurgency .

Rival streaming services Presto TV – from Foxtel and the Seven Network – and Stan – from Fairfax and Nine Entertainment – have also recently launched Down Under. Globally, Netflix has almost 60 million subscribers after launching back in 1997 as little more than a DVD mail order company. The Australian and New Zealand launch announcement comes just days after it was revealed that within 24 hours of being pirated after its release on February 27, the third season of Netflix political drama House of Cards had been illegally downloaded nearly 700,000 times. Among those who pirated the television series were 40,557 Australians, who ripped off the show more than any other nation, per capita. Figures gathered by piracy tracker Excipio and reported by Variety revealed 681,889 unique browsers illegally downloaded the highly anticipated third season of House of Cards on the day after it was released . According to the overall statistics China had the most nationals obtain the season 3 illegally, with a figure of 60,538 . Figures gathered by piracy tracker Excipio and reported by Variety revealed 681,889 unique browsers illegally downloaded the highly anticipated third season of House of Cards the day after it was released. In February 2014, the second season of the Netflix series had 320,927 downloaders within 24 hours of being pirated. According to the statistics, China had the most season 3 downloads, with 60,538, while the US - despite having access to the show on Netflix - was close behind with 50,008 people torrenting it. India ranked third with 47,106 and Australia, which has a population far smaller than the other nations listed above it, was fourth with 40, 557. Poland fifth with 37,552, with Britain (32,703), Canada (27,584), France (27,151), Greece (20,551) and the Netherlands (20,402) rounding out the top ten. Just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as 'truly frightening' Piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones . Just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as 'truly frightening', as its revealed they could expose Australian internet users to unlimited damages payout to Hollywood studios. Under the new Copyright Notice Scheme Industry Code, anyone with an internet connection could potentially face legal threats from Hollywood studios for illegally downloading movies, TV shows, and music. Consumer group Choice labelled the plan, which was compiled by Australia's largest internet service providers (ISP's) at the request of the federal government, as 'medieval' and said it 'reads like a horror movie script'. The scheme could come into affect as soon as September this year. Under the proposed code, a three-strikes system would be introduced for illegal downloads. Customers suspected of illegally downloading content will be sent a series of notices from their ISP's - a warning, an 'education' notice, and a final notice. 'The code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action. Often consumers share with flatmates, partners, or family, which means that even those who don't download illegally could be taken to court,' Ms Turner told Daily Mail Australia. Foxtel has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups . 55% of Australians who downloaded content illegally, including Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul (above)  said it was because of a lack of access . The Communications Alliance, the industry body backing the proposed code, released a statement last week emphasising the 'public education' elements of the code, but noted that the scheme did provide a process of 'facilitated preliminary discovery'. In Australia, piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones. Unlike in New Zealand, Australia has no limit to fines under the Copyright Act, and it is up to the judge's discretion as to what the consumer is fined. Choice has been vocal about providing consumers with a greater range of legal options to download the content they are seeking so that they don't resort to illegal content. 'We did a survey last year which found that a third of Australians download illegally, and more watch the illegal content,' said Ms Turner. 'When we asked people the reason they downloaded, 55% said it was because of a lack of access, and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources,' she said. Ms Turner said that 55% of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources . 'Consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online, but that they are blocked from accessing it. It makes very little sense to them.' The code indicates that rights holders need to be working towards initiatives which 'include continuing efforts of Rights Holders to ensure timely and ready availability to Australian consumers of lawful content alternatives.' However, Ms Turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as Stan available in Australia, the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed. Choice is calling on Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code, and have launched a campaign urging him to take responsibility for the internet policy.","News ends months of speculation about highly-anticipated service .

"ISIS supporters have vowed to murder Twitter staff because they believe the site's policy of shutting down their extremist pages is a 'virtual war'. A mocked-up image of the site's founder Jack Dorsey in cross-hairs was posted yesterday alongside a diatribe written in Arabic, which claimed Twitter employees' necks are 'a target for the soldiers of the Caliphate'. Addressing Mr Dorsey personally, it claimed Twitter was taking sides in a 'media war' which allowed 'slaughter', adding: 'Your virtual war on us will cause a real war on you. Diatribe: An image of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey in cross-hairs was posted alongside a rant in Arabic . It is nine years since Mr Dorsey launched the site, which is trying to avoid being a vehicle for jihadi videos . 'How will you protect your employees and supporters, helpless Jack, when their necks officially become a target for the soldiers of the Caliphate?' It also claimed killing employees  'outside a neighbourhood pub' would be no more preventable than the massacres of Charlie Hebdo killer Amedy Coulibaly and Copenhagen shooter Omar el-Hussein. It then said men and women, young and old, would all be targeted and closed by saying nothing would prevent the 'delivery of the holy mission to the world'. The rant was written anonymously and posted on the text sharing service Pastebin yesterday before being shared by ISIS supporters, including on Twitter. A Twitter spokesman told BuzzFeed law enforcement officials had been made aware of the rant and will assess whether it poses a genuine threat.

So-called 'lone wolf' attackers are encouraged by online messages . Islamic State militants have swept through huge tracts of Syria and Iraq, murdering thousands of people and forcing others to conform to an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam. Also known as ISIS and ISIL, they use social media a major propaganda tool in their bid to radicalise young Muslims and persuade them to fight in Iraq and Syria. Last year Home Secretary Theresa May said 500 Brits had gone to fight in the two countries, with cases emerging since then of schoolgirls fleeing to become jihadi brides. The terror group has posted gruesome videos and images of murder, including beheadings, on mainstream sites such as Twitter and YouTube alongside the hidden parts of the web. Both sites have a policy of taking down extremist content and blocking users who upload it, but usually by the time an account is shut down the content has spread halfway around the world.","Diatribe in Arabic posted anonymously yesterday and shared online .

"The discovery raises the prospect of giving people drugs in the very earliest stages, when it is easiest to treat, and even stopping the disease in its tracks (file image) The telltale signs of Alzheimer’s can be seen in people as young as 20, research shows. The ‘unprecedented’ finding suggests that the disease starts to eat away at the brain half a century before symptoms develop. This is a ‘much younger age than the scientists ever imagined’. The discovery raises the prospect of giving people drugs in the very earliest stages, when it is easiest to treat, and even stopping the disease in its tracks. However, British experts cautioned that the research is still at an early stage. Crucially, it isn’t known how many people who have the early signs of Alzheimer’s in their brains in their 20s will go on to develop the disease. Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and, worldwide, the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050 as the population ages. With no cure for dementia and existing drugs of limited use, the Prime Minister David Cameron has described dementia as ‘the key health challenge of this generation’. Researchers, from Northwestern University in Chicago, examined the brains of elderly people with and without Alzheimer’s, as well as samples taken from 13 people aged between 20 and 66. These younger people were free of memory problems when they died. Tests showed that beta-amyloid, the toxic protein that clogs up the brain in Alzheimer’s, had started building up in people as young as 20. It had been thought that the damage to the brain started just 15 or 20 years before the disease takes hold. Lead researcher Professor Changiz Geula said: ‘Discovering that amyloid begins to accumulate so early in life is unprecedented.’ The amyloid clumps were found inside neurons, or brain cells, that are involved in memory and attention and are among the first to die in normal ageing, as well as in Alzheimer’s. The professor said: ‘This points to why those neurons die early. The lifelong accumulation of amyloid likely contributes to the vulnerability of these cells. ‘The growing clumps likely damage and eventually kill the neurons.’ Scientists around the world are trying to make drugs that stop Alzheimer’s in its tracks. They believe the key to treatment will be to give the medicines as early as possible in the disease. But doctors called for more research to be carried out with not everyone who showed signs of Alzheimer's developing the disease . Even delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s would have a massive impact on the lives of sufferers and their loved ones. The Alzheimer’s Society gave the research, which is published in the journal Brain  a cautious welcome. Dr James Pickett, the charity’s head of research said the study was very small and that it is already known that not everyone with amyloid clumps will develop Alzheimer’s. He added: ‘More research is needed to explain why only a proportion of people with a build-up of amyloid go on to develop Alzheimer’s disease. ‘There are clinical trials currently underway of drugs that reduce amyloid in the brain and we hope to find out if this is a successful way to prevent or delay Alzheimer’s disease in the next few years.’ Dr Laura Phipps of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘With half a million people living with Alzheimer’s in the UK and that number on the increase, we urgently need new treatments to stop the disease in its tracks. ‘A greater understanding of the early stages of Alzheimer’s could provide new clues to help fight the disease, which is why investment in research is crucial.’","Discovery means people can be treated years before showing symptoms .
Tests showed toxic protein which clogs brain started growing at age 20 .
As clumps of protein build up, cells surrounding the memory weaken .

"Unemployment is falling faster in Britain than any country in Europe, new official figures showed today. A jobs surge means that in the last year the UK has overtaken the Czech Republic, Malta and Luxembourg to have the third lowest unemployment rate in all of the EU. Ministers hailed the figures which show the UK jobless rate at 5.6 per cent, half the Eurozone average. Unemployment in the UK has fallen sharply to the third lowest level in the UK, while Spain and Greece remains over 20 per cent . Overall 9.8 per cent of people across the 28-nation bloc are out of work, rising to 11.2 per cent among the countries using the euro single currency. It means a total of 23.8million people are out of work across the EU. The figure in the UK has fallen from more than 8 per cent three years ago, to 5.6 per cent in the latest league table. In the middle of 2013, the UK also had a higher unemployment rate than Denmark and Romania. Only Germany (4.7 per cent) and Austria (4.8) are now ranked higher in the league table than the UK. The UK figure has fallen faster than all major economies from 7.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent, the government said. Employment Minister Esther McVey said: 'Employers across the UK are feeling more confident, investing in people of all ages and these figures today show that the UK is at the top of the jobs growth league of all the major economies. 'The majority of the rise in employment has been in higher skilled jobs, and around 75 per cent has been in full-time work – providing peace of mind to the record numbers of people in work who can now feel more secure about having a steady income.' An official league table published by Eurostat  ranks the UK third out of the 18 countries in the EU . Employment minister Esther McVey  the UK is 'at the top of the jobs growth league' of all the major economies . The highest unemployment rate is in Greece, where more than a quarter of people are out of work. The new Greek government has sought to strike a deal with the Eurozone countries on restructuring its debts in a bid to get its economy back on track. In Spain, 23.4 per cent of people are unemployed, well ahead of the next highest, Croatia on 13.2 per cent. Youth unemployment across the EU fell by 562,000 to 4.9million, the figures also showed. In January 2015, the youth unemployment rate was 21.2 per cent in the EU and 22.9 per cent in the eurozone area. In the UK latest figures used by Eurostat show it was 16.1 per cent in November. Miss McVey added: 'No one in this country should be held back by the idea of a 'no-go career zone. 'As part of our long-term economic plan, we will support even more people develop the right skills and experience so they can fulfil their ambitions and step up to take advantage of the record number of UK vacancies offered in a wide variety of interesting careers.'","Official league table for the EU puts UK behind Germany and Austria .

"The man accused of using Facebook to lure a teenager to her death confessed the murder to his ex-girlfriend, according to testimony she gave in court on Monday. Kyle Dube, 21, of Orono, Maine, is accused of using a phony social media account to kidnap 15-year-old Nichole Cable, of Glenburn, and kill her in May 2013. The Bangor Daily News reports that Dube's ex-girlfriend Sarah Mersinger testified Monday that he told her he killed Nichole. Mersinger says Dube covered up Nichole's body with leaves and sticks. During an emotional testimony, she added: 'He told me that he strangled her at the end of her road. He said he put duct tape on her mouth, her eyes and on her hands and feet. Elaborate plot? Kyle Dube, 21, (pictured left in court last week) allegedly abducted Nichole Cable, 15, (right) in 2013 so that he could stage a rescue and be hailed as a hero. His ex-girlfriend has told a court he confessed to killing her and dumping her body in woodland in Bangor, Maine . 'He said he took her clothes off so the police dogs couldn’t smell her. He said he covered her with sticks and leaves, so they couldn’t see her from the sky.' The court heard Mersinger would spend 18 or 19 days out of 21 at the house Dube shared with his parents and a four-year-old daughter from another relationship. Mersinger also told the jury that she had met Dube on Facebook, where they began messaging each other. They began dating in November 2012 but her mother didn’t approve . Prosecutors say DNA evidence ties Dube to Nichole's disappearance. His attorneys say someone else killed the high school sophomore. Dube is pleading not guilty to abduction and murder, arguing that somebody else committed the crimes. During a court hearing last week, it was alleged Dube was intending to abduct her then stage a fake rescue so he could be hailed as a hero. According to the prosecution, the bogus account was traced to his home, his DNA was found on a hat at the end of Nichole's driveway and cell tower records show that he was in the area of Nichole's home. Accused: Prosecutors say Dube, pictured with his attorney during a hearing last Monday, left a hat with his DNA on it near Nichole's home . Defense attorney Wendy Hatch said last Monday that the state rushed to judge Dube, and she argued that someone else had committed the crimes. 'We are here to show you the state has holes in their case. They have mistakes, big mistakes,' Hatch told the jury, adding that Dube 'got up the next morning, got dressed, kissed his daughter goodbye and went to work.' Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber said Dube's DNA was also found on Cable's fingernails, and he had scratches on his face after she disappeared. He also said Dube alluded to the crime while having an emotional outburst as officers tried to calm him down while he reported to jail for an unrelated traffic offense. 'Dube responded it was what he had done, that they didn't know he had done, that he was worried about,' Macomber said. Horrifying: The court heard Dube (mugshot left) covered Nichole's (right) body in leaves so she couldn't be seen from the sky and took her clothes off so police dogs couldn't smell her . The trial is expected to last two weeks and includes a witness list with more than 80 names. The case prompted discussions about the appropriate use of social media at the high school she attended in Old Town. Nichole's mother, Kristine Wiley, testified that she knew Dube as a friend of her daughter's who came by their house two or three times before her disappearance. Between tears, she testified that Dube reached out to her with an offer to baby-sit her other children after Nichole vanished but before her body was found. Wiley said Dube first told her he had heard Wiley said he was responsible for Nichole's disappearance. Wiley said she denied the accusation and that Dube then told her 'if I needed anything, call' and that he would watch her other children for her. She said she never took him up on the offer.

"Apple’s Touch ID is fast and accurate - until your hand is even the slightest bit dirty or wet. But in the near future these scanners will not only work when your fingerprints are obscured, they will work behind layers of glass and metal. Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner capable of capturing everything from ridges to sweat pores using ultrasonic technology. The demo version (pictured) was covered in glass that measures 0.9mm thick, and Qualcomm did not reveal what the maximum thickness is. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with . A prototype version of the sensor is on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. When a finger is placed on the tiny sensor - the demo version has a 9mm by 4mm ‘active area’ - the software captures an image of the fingerprint instantly. Apple’s Touch ID (pictured) is fast and accurate - until your hand is even the slightest bit dirty or wet . This is stored and used to authenticate a user quickly, with little margin of error. And because it uses waves that bounce off the surface of the finger it can be used behind materials such as glass or metal. The demo version was covered in glass that measures 0.9mm thick, and Qualcomm did not reveal what the maximum thickness is. The firm did say, though, that the technology makes it more accurate and powerful than capacitive sensors, like those seen on Apple and Samsung devices. And this is the reason why it works even if the user has dirty hands, has recently applied hand lotion and other similar scenarios. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. Fujitsu has developed a ‘custom compact and high-output infrared LED’, and a custom infrared camera. Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye’s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina . These were combined with Fujitsu’s camera controller technology and biometric-authentication technology. It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris. The pattern doesn’t change significantly after the age of two, and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge. Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye’s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina. For its prototype, Fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone. It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera. This pattern is registered and linked to the user. Each time they look at their phone, the sensor scans their eye, matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device. ‘The system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations,’ a spokesman for Fujitsu told MaiOnline . ‘This can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance, rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require. ‘And in safety testing, the infrared LED light was verified to be safe for the eyes.’","Chip maker Qualcomm unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner .

"The mother of a two-year-old who is allergic to the sun wants her daughter's condition to be recognised as a disability. Monroe Mills has two rare skin conditions, photo-aggravated eczema and solar urticaria, which cause her to break out in painful welts when she spends just seconds in direct sunlight. But it is not just the outside of Monroe that suffers when she is exposed, it is her insides too. Scroll down for video . Monroe Mills has two rare skin conditions, which cause her to break out in painful welts. When she does, the only way to soothe her is to wrap her up in bandages (pictured above with her doll also named Monroe) Monroe, 2, has suffered from the condition since she was born. She is pictured on the right with her late cat, Marley . Mother Sarah Mills, from Nambucca Heads on New South Wales' mid-north coast, told Daily Mail Australia her daughter gets headaches and stomach pains along with becoming lethargic and dizzy. 'A GP just told us she gets [the symptoms] outside as well as inside her body,' the 28-year-old said. To help prevent this from happening, Monroe wears a head-to-toe bodysuit to cover up as well as slathering on sunscreen and zinc, and wearing a hat and sunglasses. Ms Mills said it was mission for the family to go shopping or to the doctor's, and lately the two-year-old's reactions had become so severe that they have had to start carrying around an epipen. Mother Sarah Mills (pictured left with her son, Hendrix, and Monroe) is fighting to have daughter's conditions recognised as a disability . Exposure to the sun causes painful welts and means Monroe spends most of the night awake. Ms Mills said she averages four hours sleep on 'a good night' The flare-ups could also be caused by fluoroscent lights inside shopping centres . She said Monroe's flare-ups could happen any time her daughter stepped into the sunlight. She could be outside for 20 seconds or just a matter of minutes before she would break out. 'We just remain as indoors as much as humanly possibly,' Mr Monroe said. 'We run into the shops as fast as we can from the car. 'If we wanted to go shopping, she’d have a flare up from the fluorescent lights.' When Monroe's skin does break out in welts, the only way to soothe her is to put her in a bleach bath, apply steroid creams, and then wrap her in wet and dry layers of bandages. This happens so often now that the little girl becomes distraught when she sees her mother getting out any type of cream. 'She's become extremely scared of creams. When she sees the sunscreen or steroid creams come out she starts crying,' Ms Mills told Daily Mail Australia. 'She's had enough of being creamed up 24 hours a day. At night, she breaks down and starts crying because she's so itchy and in pain.' The two-year-old's brother, Hendrix (pictured on the left), has autism. Ms Mills recently had to quit her job to become Monroe's full-time carer . To prevent her breaking out, Monroe dons a head-to-toe bodysuit (pictured) along with slathering on sunscreen and wearing sunglasses . This is Monroe's every day life and her welts can last for 20 minutes to several hours. Broken sleep patterns are the norm for her and Ms Mills who averages about four hours a night on 'a good night'. 'It’s extremely heart breaking to watch her in so much pain. Now that she is at the age where she can put two and two together she asks from the back seat while we're driving to doctors: ""Why does the sun hate me, Mummy?"",' Ms Mills said. 'It just shatters my heart for her when she thinks that the sun hates her. It’s really confronting.' On top of looking after Monroe, Ms Mills also has an autistic five-year-old son, Hendrix. She recently had to quit her job to become a full-time carer. People point and laugh at Monroe (left) when she is in her bodysuit (right) and Ms Mills wants that to stop by raising awareness of her daughter's conditions . The single mother-of-two has started up a fundraising campaign to help her cover the costs of caring for Monroe, which include a special $50 sunscreen and $200 in fuel costs a month to visit a doctor in Newcastle. Ms Mills said she spends at least $200 a week on meeting Monroe's needs alone. She gets no other assistance from the Federal Government other than a carer's allowance because they do not recognise Monroe's conditions as a disability. 'I can't work because of how demanding her needs are. No employer is going to be okay with me taking every second week off because Monroe is in hospital,' she said. Ms Mills says she has reached breaking point while caring for Monroe and is trying to get more help . At first, Ms Mills used her Miracle for Monroe Facebook page to raise awareness of her daughter's conditions because people were laughing and pointing at her in the street when she wore her bodysuit. 'In the beginning, she was pointed at and laughed at, not just by kids but adults too. She picks up on it now and I want everyone in the world to know [about her conditions] and stop laughing at her,' Ms Mills said. 'I want people to understand the struggles she’s going through. 'We have people ask her what’s wrong with her and I tell them she’s allergic to the sun and people say: ""Thank goodness, I thought she had been burnt"". 'I'm not saying being burnt is not bad, but there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Whereas Monroe is in constant pain and doctors are happy to say stay home. 'She can't even play in the park.

"UP to 30 babies and mothers died at a scandal-hit hospital because of failings by midwives and doctors, a damning report is expected to reveal. The independent inquiry into baby deaths within University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust will show that the scale of the scandal was much worse than previously feared. It had been thought that 16 babies and two mothers had died as a result of shambolic care over nearly ten years at a maternity ward within Furness General Hospital in Cumbria. Tragedy: Joshua Titcombe was nine days old when he died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics at Furness General Hospital, Cumbria . But after highlighting concerns in around 50 cases, investigators are expected to conclude that neglect contributed to even more deaths. Health officials have tried to cover up their failure to properly investigate poor patient care on the unit. Despite multiple warnings about failings between 2001 and 2012, the Care Quality Commission gave the hospital a clean bill of health in 2010. The failure to strike off any nurse, doctor or midwife working at the hospital has enraged victims’ families. Concerns were first raised in September 2008 when Joshua Titcombe, who was nine days old, died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics. His father James said it was ‘appalling’ that nobody has been disciplined for the failings that led to the deaths and described the accountability process as ‘ridiculously slow’. Up to 30 babies and mothers died at Furness General Hospital because of failings by midwives and doctors, a damning report is expected to reveal . Mr Titcombe said: ‘It’s been six years since Joshua died and we have should been finding out about [the care failings] at the time. It’s a sign of how closed and secretive the NHS was. ‘We were faced with obstacle after obstacle which is an indictment of how the NHS was run at the time. ‘What happened to protecting mothers and babies? The timescale is a disgrace.’ He said there was no reason why culpable nurse and doctors could not have been held to account before the report was published. A number of midwives from the hospital are due to face the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) later this year in relation to deaths at the hospital. Grief: James and Hoa Titcombe lost their baby son Joshua in 2008 . Mr Titcombe added: ‘For Joshua to have died in 2008 and the NMC’s processes to still be ongoing is absolutely appalling. How can that be protecting mothers and babies? ‘There has been a real failure in the way the professional regulators have worked.’ The independent inquiry into the trust, expected to be published next month, was finally ordered by ministers due to mounting concerns over the deaths of at least eight mothers and babies. While officials continued to cover up the extent of the hospital’s problems, a police investigation was eventually launched after repeated complaints from victims’ families. The report is expected to lay some of the blame on the ‘dysfunctional’ relationship between midwives and doctors on the ward, according to the Sunday Times. The widespread ‘loss’ of medical records that contained vital medical information, such as in the case of Joshua Titcombe, will also be highlighted. An internal review published in March 2010 highlighted concerns about the maternity unit including the relations between staff. The CQC, however, failed to read the report and passed the hospital as ‘safe’ a year later. When a CQC official produced a dossier showing the inspection was flawed, bosses told him to destroy it to protect the commission’s reputation. The extent to which officals have tried to deflect attention from the failing hospital has been branded ‘rotten’ by ministers and likened to the Mid-Staffordshire Trust cover-up. The CQC and the parliamentary and health service ombudsman are also thought to be in line for criticism in Dr Bill Kirkup’s report. It will raise more questions about how medical staff and those tasked with inspecting the quality of care provided are held to account. A string of senior staff at the trust have ‘stepped down’ from their jobs with lucrative pay packets - but nobody has been sacked. Others linked to the alleged cover-up have also left their roles, with families expected to continue with legal action against the trust following the report’s publication. Former chief executive of the Morecambe Bay Trust, Tony Halsall, left in March with a £225,000 pay-off and has since moved to the private sector. Jill Finney, former deputy chief executive of the CQC, was awarded £60,000 for distress after she was accused covering up a CQC report. She always denied the allegation. The Morecombe Bay Trust however has refused to say whether it has taken any action against any staff members or whether the nurses are still employed.","Up to 30 babies and mothers died at Furness General Hospital .

'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. 'About 20 per cent of girls are good.' The depraved murder of Jyoti Singh in December 2012 sparked revulsion across the world as well as a wave of protests in India, where people demanded a change in attitudes towards women. The 23-year-old student had been returning from a cinema with a male friend on a Sunday evening when she accepted a lift from the off-duty charter bus. Once inside, bus driver Mukesh Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager subjected to a horrific rape. She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines. Jyoti's death sparked a period of deep soul searching in India, where equal rights for women are enshrined in the constitution but rarely effective in practise. But even today, Mukesh Singh remains unrepentant. In an in-depth interview with filmmaker Leslee Udwin, as part of a documentary to be broadcast on BBC Four, he blamed Jyoti for daring to fight back against her attackers. 'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent and allow the rape,' he said. 'Then they'd have dropped her off after ""doing her"", and only hit [her friend] the boy.' His impending execution, he suggests, is a foolish move that will only endanger future rape victims. 'The death penalty will make things even more dangerous for girls,' he said. 'Now when they rape, they won't leave the girl like we did. They will kill her. 'Before, they would rape and say, ""Leave her, she won't tell anyone."" Now when they rape, especially the criminal types, they will just kill the girl. Death.' Mukesh Singh and his accomplices treated Jyoti no better. After luring her aboard the bus, they took turns raping her and beat her with an iron rod when frantically tried to fight them off. Two blood stained metal rods were later retrieved from the bus; medical staff confirmed that 'it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals, uterus and intestines'. And after the rapists had enough, rather than 'dropping her off' they threw her and her friend from the moving bus. Mukesh Singh then allegedly tried to run them over, but her friend had enough strength left to pull Jyoti out of the way. Despite efforts to get her the best medical care, even flying her to a hospital in Singapore, Jyoti died 13 days later, having suffered brain damage, pneumonia, and abdominal infection. Doctors had already been forced to remove most of her intestine. Protest: Jyoti's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second-class citizens . Anger: Protestors had given Jyoti - whose name was at that point still barred from release - the name Damini after a Bollywood film of the same name where the protagonist fought for justice after a rape ordeal . Outrage: Protestors hold candles in New Delhi during a night vigil following the 23-year-old student's gang-rape and murder. It was this outpouring that inspired the documentary about Jyoti's death . For filmmaker Ms Udwin it was not the horror of the attack that compelled her to make her documentary, but the outpouring of anger in India at the social conditions that allowed it to happen. 'When news of this gang-rape hit our TV screens in December 2012, I was as shocked and upset as we all are when faced with such brazen abandon of the norms of ‘civilised’ society,' she said. 'But what actually inspired me to commit to the harrowing and difficult journey of making this film was the optimism occasioned by the reports that followed the rape. 'Courageous and impassioned ordinary men and women of India braved the December freeze to protest in unprecedented numbers, withstanding an onslaught of teargas shells, lathi charges and water canons, to make heard their cry of ""enough is enough"". 'In this regard, India led the world by example. In my lifetime, I can’t recall any other country standing up with such commitment and determination for women’s rights.' Mukesh Singh, who denies raping Jyoti but admitted driving the bus where she was attacked, and three others are currently awaiting the outcome of appeals against their convictions. His brother Ram, widely considered leader of the group, was found dead in his cell in March 2013. The fifth, juvenile perpetrator was also convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to three years in a reform facility. Passing sentence on the gang in September 2013, a judge condemned their 'exceptional depravity'.","Mukesh Singh drove the bus where Jyoti Singh was raped in 2012 .

"Feared across India, the exiled Aghori monks of Varanasi feast on human flesh and reside near cremation sites in search of spiritual enlightenment. Showing the monks with painted faces and beads strung around their necks, these incredible images were taken by  Italian photographer Cristiano Ostinelli, who spent time with the tribe to discover more about their way of life. The mysterious tribe members live in cemeteries and feast on human flesh as part of their rituals, as well as drinking from human skulls, chewing the heads off live animals and meditating on top of cadavers in search of spiritual enlightenment. The Aghori monks of Varanasi are feared throughout India and are believed to be able to see the future . Italian photographer Cristiano Ostinelli spent time with the mysterious tribe to capture their mysterious way of life . The monks feast on human flesh, drink from human skulls and are even said to bite the heads off life animals for their rituals . Mr Ostinelli explained: 'There is a great mystery around them and the Indians fear them, they say they can predict the future, walk on water and do evil prophecies.' The monks use a combination of marijuana, alcohol and meditation to help them reach a disconnected state of heightened awareness and bring themselves closer to revered Hindu god Lord Shiva. The Aghori also believe that by immersing themselves without prejudice in what others deem taboo or disturbing, they're on course to achieving enlightenment. The Varanasi tribe live near cremation sites and use a combination of alcohol and marijuana with meditation to reach enlightenment . The monks trace their roots to the 17th-century puritan Baba Kinaram, who is said to have lived to the age of 170 . With painted faces and often seen wearing little or no clothing, their way of life is said to discourage an attachment to earthly delusions . The monks believe that the body is inconsequential and flesh and blood are simply transitory, which is why they surround themselves with death and decay . They live among India's cremation sites - where Lord Shiva and goddess Kali Ma are said to dwell - and feed on what others throw away. Bodies are often cremated and then scattered into the sacred Ganges river, but some bodies are disposed of without cremation. The Aghori are said to collect these remains and use them for their spiritual enlightenment, wearing the corpses, consuming them or building alters from them. The mysterious tribe drink alcohol from human skulls, known as kapalas, and are said to also drink urine and eat faecal matter . The Italian photographer spent time with the tribe, which lives on the fringes of society, to capture incredible images of their way of life .

The monks use their unusual rituals to bring them closer to the revered Hindu god Shiva . The monks believe that flesh and blood are transitory and that the body is ultimately inconsequential. They emphasise this notion through their habit of dwelling in cemeteries and by surrounding themselves with death and decay. The Aghori shun material belongings and often walk around unclothed. This encourages detachment from what they see as earthly delusions and better signifies the human body in its purest form.

"It sounds like a scene from a science fiction film but if one food concept designer has her way this is how everybody will be eating in the near future. While 3D food-printing technology is not a new thing, the invention of this self-growing snack that makes its own filling could change the way we consume food, forever. The Edible Growth project is the brainchild of Dutch concept designer Chloé Rutzerveld who conceived of the idea to show that high-tech or lab-produced food does not have to be 'unhealthy and unnatural.' Scroll down for video . The Edible Growth project is the brainchild of Dutch food and concept designer Chloé Rutzerveld . Embedded in a pastry shell are seeds, yeast and spores, which take between three to five days to fully mature . The snack is a pastry shell embedded with seeds, yeast and spores, which take three to five days to mature, after which it is ready to be consumed. On her website Ms Rutzerveld explained in a video: 'The Edible Growth Project is about creating a fully edible ecosystem with living organisms in which the base gets printed by a 3D-printer and gradually develops towards a fully-fledged dish.' Multiple layers containing seeds, spores and yeast are printed according to a personalized 3D file. Within five days the plants and fungi mature and the yeast ferments the solid inside into a liquid. The product’s intensifying structure, scent and taste are reflected in its changing appearance. Depending on the preferred intensity, the consumer decides when to harvest and enjoy the delicious, fresh and nutrient-rich edible. According to Ms Rutzerveld, the project is an example of high-tech but fully natural, healthy, and sustainable food made possible by combining aspects of nature, science, technology and design. Edible Growth makes use of natural processes like fermentation and photosynthesis and lowers the use of resources. She explained: 'It shows that high tech food doesn't have to be unhealthy or unnatural, but that it can actually have a lot of advantages. 'The printer is not only used as a kind of shaping machine in which material A gets in and also comes out in another shape but it is used to create innovative food that truly contributes to solving the world's food problems.' The snack in its various stages: 3D-printed nylon prototype (left) and growth test to see if it will take (right) Success: The inner workings of the Edible Growth prototype which shows mushrooms and sprouts . The food designer aims to use the new food technology to create natural, healthy, sustainable and nutrient rich food that cannot be made with traditional production methods. 'With Edible Growth a lot of unnecessary stages of the food chain disappear with as result a reduction of food waste, food miles and CO2 emission. At the same time the consumer will become more involved and conscious about the food they eat,' she continued. The product is built from several layers, with an outer shell of crust made of dough or pasta, and on the inside spores, seeds, yeast and edible soiled are contained. A new way of eating: From machine to mouth in five days. The food designer hopes her concept will change the way we view and consume food in the future . The new food technology will create natural, healthy, sustainable, and nutrient rich food that cannot be made using traditional production methods . After it has been printed, the consumer takes it home and within three to five days, it will develop into a complete dish that contains all the nutrients a the body needs. She compares the process to the maturing of cheese. 'Just like Roquefort cheese, the intensity of its taste, smell and whole eating experience increases over time. 'If we could produce our food this way, you can imagine that the food supply chain would shrink immensely,' she said. The project is still at a conceptual stage at this point. 'Apart from the necessary technological development, a lot of biotechnological research will be needed on the composition of ingredients and food safety for instance,' she said. 'Right now Edible Growth is really a future food concept, that inspires scientists, designers, and cooks to think about the future of our food.'","The Edible Growth project brainchild food designer Chloé Rutzerveld .

"Grayson Perry's unusual Gingerbread House holiday home has been branded an 'abomination' by local villagers inundated with art fans flocking to see the property. The Turner Prize-winning artist teamed up with the organisation Living Architecture to design the unique holiday cottage in the sleepy village of Wrabness. But locals - who battled the original plans - claim art fans flocking to catch a glimpse of the artist's creation are clogging up the narrow streets. Scroll down for video . The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie' The quirky cottage was supposed to 'explore the special character and unique qualities of Essex' and is expected to open for holiday bookings in the spring. But the local council has already been forced to redesign surrounding roads and car parks to accommodate the influx of art fans. One frustrated villager, who refused to be named, said: 'This is a tiny village known for its tranquillity. 'We're not a snotty London art gallery, yet our tiny roads are now besieged on a daily basis by day trippers asking for directions to the dreaded 'Gingerbread House'. 'I can only imagine how bad it will be in the summer. 'I still do not understand how this abomination got planning permission in the first place?' Wrabness Parish Council strongly objected to the proposal to knock down the existing farmhouse and replace it with the imposing structure that combines sculptures, tapestries and ceramics. Villagers in Wrabness have said that Grayson Perry's 'Gingerbread house' has caused traffic chaos . The Turner Prize-winning artist is known primarily for his work with ceramics, and right, the house in honour to a mythical Essex woman called 'Julie' The original plans for the home were turned down by Tendring District Council but a re-submitted application for the wacky home was given the green-light by planners. The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie'. Perry admitted he had originally designed the house whilst ‘doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the television’. The house is located on the banks of the River Stour, in the rural village of Wrabness . He wanted it to resemble a ‘jewel box’ that told the story of a mythical Essex woman called Julie, who had a difficult childhood, love life, divorce and late career. Hence, there’s an 8ft statue of her on the roof, naked and pregnant, and her name is emblazoned all over the walls. Essex County Council Highways Authority have now agreed to redesign tiny local roads to improve access to the site. Talks are also ongoing to use the nearby Wrabness Railway Station as a car park for art enthusiasts. The cottage - officially named 'A House for Essex' - is set to open to holidaymakers in the next few months . An Essex Highways spokesman said: 'Following a meeting, it was agreed to implement a number of requests for road improvements in Black Boy Lane, Wrabness. 'These include a variety of new and replacement road signs and renewed and repositioned road markings. 'Cllrs Bass and Johnson also agreed to write to NCP and National Rail to encourage them to discuss parking issues with the parish council.' The cottage - officially named 'A House for Essex' - is set to open to holidaymakers in the next few months. Grayson Perry was contacted for comment but has yet to respond.","The Turner Prize winning artist designed the holiday cottage in Wrabness .

"Her profile is one of the most famous in the world and is seen every day on coins, stamps and bank notes, but now, the Queen is to get a new look. A new coin portrait of Her Majesty has been unveiled by the Royal Mint and will be used on currency from this year. The effigy, which was designed by engraver Jody Clark, is only the fifth official coin portrait made during the Queen's 63-year reign and replaces the current one, which first appeared in 1998. Scroll down for video . New look: The latest coin portrait of the Queen has been unveiled by the Royal Mint . Familiar: The profile, which shows the Queen in the George IV diadem, will be used on coins from 2015 on . Unlike the previous one, which shows Her Majesty in the Girls of Great Britain tiara, the new portrait shows her wearing the George IV State Diadem and a delicate pair of  drop earrings. Commissioned in 1820 by George IV, the diadem, which is most often seen during the State Opening of Parliament, has 1,333 diamonds and 169 pearls, arranged in rose, thistle and shamrock designs to represent England, Scotland and Ireland. Like its owner, the diadem also has a long history of appearing on coins and bank notes, having appeared on currency belonging to the UK, Australia, Canada and the British Caribbean territories among many others. The new portrait was chosen from a selection of anonymously submitted designs, with creator Jody Clark becoming, at 34, the youngest engraver ever to create a royal coin portrait. Likeness: The new portrait is an updated version of the Ian Rank-Broadley design, created in 1997 . Creator: 34-year-old engraver Jody Clark, from the Lake District, created the winning design . New look: The new coin portrait is only the fifth to be produced during the Queen's reign, with the first in 1953 . 'I really liked the four previous coin portraits - each one is strong in its own way,' says a delighted Mr Clark. 'I hope that I’ve done Her Majesty justice and captured her as I intended. 'The news that my design had been chosen was quite overwhelming, and I still can’t quite believe that my royal portrait will be featured on millions of coins.' Speaking about the decision to award Mr Clark the job, Kevin Clancy, director of the Royal Mint Museum, said the judging panel’s decision was 'pretty unanimous'. Mr Clark, who is originally from the Lake District, says his family are 'really proud', adding: 'They’ve had to keep quiet about this. 'It’s going to be hard to top this. It’s going to take a while to sink in. I’m really happy with how it’s turned out. I can only hope everyone appreciates it.' The first coin portrait of the Queen's reign appeared in 1953, shortly after she took the throne, and was designed by Mary Gillick. Heading for your wallet: The new coin will be introduced this year . Although the four subsequent designs show her wearing a crown, her first portrait showed a fresh-faced young Queen wearing nothing more than an evergreen wreath. That all changed when a new coin portrait entered circulation in April 1968, which showed a sterner version of the Queen in the George IV diadem. The image, which was designed by Arnold Machin, was replicated on stamps and remains one of the most famous portraits of the Queen ever created. In 1985 came another new coin portrait, this time by Raphael Maklouf who once again showed the monarch in the George IV diadem. Unusually, the new portrait proved controversial with Maklouf accused of making the effigy 'flatteringly youthful'. Unimpressed, he swiftly hit back at critics, telling them his intention had been to create something 'regal and ageless'. For the fourth coin portrait of the Queen, which replaced Maklouf's design in 1997, Her Majesty chose to wear the magnificent Girls of Great Britain tiara. The gem, which was made for Queen Mary on the occasion of her wedding in 1893, is one of the most spectacular in the Royal Collection and features 13 brilliant-cut diamonds as its centrepiece. Along with its appearance on the 1997 coins, it was also worn by the Queen to marry the Duke of Edinburgh in November 1947.

"Hannah Green's 30th birthday is a day she will never forget but not for the reasons you might expect. At 20 weeks pregnant, it was also the day Hannah, now 31, discovered her unborn daughter Lola had a congenital heart disease and would need open heart surgery as soon as she was born. With no history of the condition in the family the unexpected news left Hannah and her partner Gerard Bradley, 30, from Gosport, Hampshire, devastated, and Hannah vowed to do everything she could to ensure her daughter had the best start in life. Scroll down for video . Hannah Green with daughter Lola, now a happy and healthy eight months old . Hannah said: 'It was my routine 20-week scan and they couldn't see the valve coming off the left hand side of the baby's heart. 'None of this affected the baby while it was inside me but once the baby was delivered they wouldn't be able to get enough oxygen.' Hannah and Gerard's baby had transposition of the great arteries, a rare heart defect in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed. Because of the shock diagnosis the couple decided to find out the sex of their unborn baby, which they had planned to keep a surprise. 'I felt like we needed to know her sex. I needed to feel something positive and connect with her. We didn't need any more surprises,' first time mum said. The diagnosis meant that Lola would need open heart surgery to switch the arteries back to their correct position as soon as she was born. Lola had open heart surgery when she was just ten days old in an eight-hour operation to swap arteries . Newborn Lola with proud parents Hannah and dad Gerard Bradley, a tattoo artist . 'It's so easy to take it for granted when you have a healthy baby. When you find out there's a problem with your baby that will require medical intervention you want to do anything you can to make it better.' So when Hannah attended London ExCel's Baby Show in February 2014 and came across stem cell banking company Precious Cells, she realised the procedure could prove priceless. Stem cells are found in the cord blood that remains in the placenta and umbilical cord, which are usually thrown away, after a baby is born. The stem cells are an exact DNA match to the baby and can help cure many life threatening diseases, such as leukaemia and sickle cell disease. Although stem cell banking is popular in America there are currently only four NHS hospitals in the UK offering the service. New parents – including Sky Sports presenter Natalie Pinkham who gave birth to her first child Wilfred in January - are using private stem cell banking companies instead. Hannah said: 'We were going to look for a crib and a pram and came away with information about stem cell banking.' Hannah feels comforted by knowing her daughter's precious stem cells will be there for her until she's 30 . The family poses for a snap, with Lola, who wears a pacemaker to regulate her heart, grinning at the camera . 'There are so many different things that can be done with stem cells. Doctors are creating better and new ways of doing things all the time, and we realised this could help our baby when she's older. It could also protect any future children we have.' But with a price tag of more than £2,000 the procedure was way out of Hannah and tattoo artist Gerard's price range. Luckily for Hannah Precious Cells was running a competition offering parents-to-be the chance to win free banking by explaining what the prize would mean to their family on the company's Facebook page. So Hannah – who until then had never won anything in her life - relayed her story and was stunned when she was chosen as the winner. The couple were given a box containing a special bag in which the cord blood could be stored, and the number of a phlebotomist who would come to the hospital and harvest the blood as soon as Lola was delivered. 'We had to call the number as soon as I went into labour and keep them updated on progress,' said Hannah, who was two weeks overdue when she finally went into labour in June last year. But because Lola's heart rate kept dropping she was born by emergency caesarean at Princess Anne Hospital in Southampton after a 36-hour labour, weighing a healthy 7lb 2oz. 'The phlebotomist was in the delivery room with us and she collected the cord blood and placenta straight away. She went into a separate room, took everything she needed and put it into a special bag. Then I was given the box back with the bag inside, and we had to call a courier to come and collect it.' Hannah Green says of Lola: 'We don't know what the future holds for us and the stem cells could help her heart condition in the future' Hannah Green had her daughter's stem cells harvested through Precious Cells . The courier arrived within hours of Lola's birth to collect the stem cells, which have now been cryogenically frozen by Precious Cells at their bio bank in London for 30 years. 'There are all sorts of certificates and insurance policies in case something happens to the storage facility or the company goes out of business,' says Hannah. Lola was immediately transferred to Southampton General Hospital where she underwent full open heart surgery in an eight-hour operation to swap the arteries in her heart when she was ten days old. 'It was a very traumatic, stressful and emotional time,' Hannah said. 'I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.' The surgery was a success and 10 days later Lola was fitted with a pacemaker to regulate her heart beat. At four weeks old Hannah and Gerard were finally able to take their daughter home, and although she will require life-long care she is now a happy and healthy eight-month-old baby. 'Babies who have undergone heart surgery can never have a normal heart again. They have a repaired heart,' said Hannah. 'We don't know what the future holds for us and the stem cells could help her heart condition in the future.' 'Sometimes I forget we have the stem cells banked, and then I remember and feel relief. It's an insurance policy for the future, just in case. If we don't end up using it I will find out whether we can donate it.' Sky Sport presenter Natalie Pinkham used a private stem cell banking company after having her first baby Wilfred in January .","Hannah Green's daughter  Lola was born with congenital heart disease .

"Government employees have been caught stealing students' personal information to apply for loans, credit cards and set up new cell phone accounts,Daily Mail Online has learned. Reports on breaches of staff conduct inside the Department of Education shows how workers stole social security numbers from a database while a man was fired for trying to look up President Barack Obama’s student loan records. Cyber security campaigners warned that the failure to protect sensitive information because of 'bureaucratic incompetence' is just the 'tip of the iceberg'. Scroll down for documents . Identify theft: Reports from the Department of Education revealed officials tried to steal social security numbers from a database while another was disciplined for trying to look up President Obama’s student loans . Insiders involved in illicit breaches are often overlooked, simply because the public think hackers and cybercriminals are more often to blame, they said. Lee Tien, senior staff attorney and Adams Chair for Internet Rights at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the Daily Mail Online 'insiders are frequently part of the breach story'. He added that entities - especially the government - need to uphold their duty to safeguard other people's personal information. Berin Szoka, the president of Tech Freedom, insisted some of the privacy issues come from within the government. 'As usual, the real privacy problem is government. Big Brother surveillance at the NSA is bad enough,' he told the Daily Mail Online. 'But bureaucratic incompetence can be far bigger problem. Failing to protect sensitive student loan data is just the tip of the iceberg of poor data security inside government.' According to the documents - obtained by the Daily Mail Online through a Freedom of Information Act request - a number of government employees set up an illicit scheme to steal students' information. One woman created a bogus Department of Education account to access the National Student Loan Data System to aid her criminal plot. While accessing the records, she would extract information from individual accounts. She swapped around the last four digits of her SSN with those of another during the scheme, and set up the fake identity to apply for credit cards, personal loans and set up a Sprint cell phone account. An internal investigation within the department found she went into the database 24 times between 2006 and 2009 to retrieve the information. Just 24 hours after searching through the database on one occasion in 2009, the documents revealed she applied for a personal loan. Concerns: Cyber security campaigners have warned that failing to protect sensitive information because of 'bureaucratic incompetence' is just the 'tip of the iceberg'. Pictured is the Department for Education's Washington headquarters . The unidentified employee was arrested and charged in 2011 for stealing more than $500 using the stolen details. One of the documents related to her case reads: 'It appears [the employee] did not have a business reason to run either name in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).' After pleading guilty, she was sentenced to 18 months in jail with a 17-month suspended sentence. However, according to the documents, the employee only served a month in prison and was then given authorized work by a judge. It's not known what happened to the other staff members involved in the scheme. In 2011, a man violated department protocols by trying to access 'Barrack [sic] Obama’s student loans records. According to the documents he consistently spelled the president's name wrong - using two 'r's. The employee involved was not prosecuted, but lost his job after departmental staff also discovered he had misused his government-issued travel card. It is not clear why he tried to access the records as Obama has made the majority of his financial history public knowledge. He paid off his student loans in in 2004 while he was in the Illinois State Senate. He took out $42,753 in loans to pay for his Harvard Law School tuition while Michelle applied for $40,762 in loans for her Harvard Law education. The couple carried their debt for 25 years, but the president is believed to have paid it off using  $1.9million worth of royalties from his book, Dreams of My Father. It was reissued and became a best seller after his speech at the Democratic convention in 2004. A third Department of Education employee was investigated in 2014 for using his government email to promote his own business at the taxpayers' expense. Some of the documents involved have been heavily redacted. The analysis revealed there were approximately 166 calls totaling 616 minutes or approximately 10 hours of calls during on-duty hours. His calls cost the government approximately $478.36 based on his hourly salary. He admitted that he shouldn't have used government equipment - including a scanner, printer, phone and email - for his own personal gain, but it's not clear what type of business he was operating or whether he was punished. Another part of the document trove described the investigation into Joseph Butler, a veteran department employee from Clarkstown, Georgia, who accessed child pornography for years. According to reports he was able to filter his computer activity and get around filtering software preventing government staff from visiting illicit websites. More than 70 disturbing images were founded embedded in several Microsoft Word documents that were then saved to his government computer. His Internet browsing history also revealed he had searched for child nudity and pornography. Butler used his computer to download images onto CD-ROMs, which federal agents found during a search of his home in July 2011. Agents also found graphic stories Butler had written about children. He is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence. When he is released he will have to sign up to the sex offenders register and completed five years of supervision. The Department of Education did not comment on the revelations. However a report in 2015 addressing 'management challenges' highlighted 'repeated problems in IT security and noted increasing threats and vulnerabilities to the Department’s systems and data.' The document said more steps needed to be taken to make sure federal employees did not breach the database. One of the factors considered was a two-step authorization process - but it is yet to be implemented. In September 2013 the Office of the Inspector General - who oversee the Department's management - warned officials there were weaknesses led to 'unauthorized accesses to private information.'","One employee used students' personal information to apply for a loan .

"It was a feat many deemed impossible, with previous attempts ending in fatalities and failure. But in 1958, Vivian ‘Bunny’ Fuch, successfully led a Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition team to complete the first ever overland crossing of Antarctica via the South Pole. Part of the triumphant team was Everest veteran George Lowe, who documented the magnificent feat, and his photographs provide a fascinating insight into one of the 20th century's greatest explorations. The Crossing of Antarctica, by George Lowe and Huw Lewis-Jones, celebrates the achievements of the 1957/1958 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition team . Edmund Hillary joined the team for the final stages of the crossing. Here, Ed and Bunny melt a chunk of ice in their tent to make some tea . 'Magga Dan left us at the end of January 1957. After a frantic day of writing last letters for home, we headed down to the ice edge to wave her off. We felt no regrets as we had not been marooned; instead our real adventure was just beginning. Our thoughts turned to the huge challenges that would lay ahead to secure our way out - 2,000 miles across a continent' Despite not being as enamoured with the scenery as he was with Everest, Lowe snapped amazing images of the epic voyage, but sadly died while the book he co-authored with Huw Lewis-Jones, The Crossing of Antarctica, was in production. The expedition team arrived in Antarctica in November 1955, where they spent nearly two years building base camps on the continent. Fuchs and 11 other men left a base camp on the New Zealand sector of the Antarctic in late November 1957, and began the overland crossing. A further party set off from the other side of the continent, under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary. 'The long Antarctic night was ending and darkness was giving way to the twilight weeks. Having dug out the aircraft it was time to get everything set for the long journey' The team faced harsh conditions such as snow piling up on their accommodation's roof. The snow actually helped to keep the heat in . Originally the plan had been to rendezvous at the South Pole around Christmas, but bad weather stalled the British team about 357 miles from the pole. Fuchs' team arrived at the pole on January 19, 1958, where the two forces united to push on to Scott Base Camp, where Hillary's party had started. The triumphant teams arrived there on March 2, 1958, 99 days after Fuchs' expedition had begun. Discoveries along the way included the British team finding a 7,000-foot mountain range, and the New Zealanders discovering a 9,000-foot range. Fierce winter winds scoured the ice into a large gully behind the hut at Shackleton. Meteorologist Hannes le Grange documented wind speeds nearing 60 knots . Dog teams remained a vital part of the expedition. This shot was taken by members of the New Zealand party on the Skelton Glacier. They were the first men to set foot there, and establishing a route up on to the plateau was crucial to the future success of the main crossing. A cavalcade of machines would roar down here in 1958 . Fuch received a telegram from Queen Elizabeth II after completion of the 99-day trip. 'You have made a notable contribution to scientific knowledge and have succeeded in a great enterprise,' it read. Bunny and his team were knighted for their trip, which went beyond crossing 2,500 miles of harsh terrain in the world's most hostile climate. The comrades confirmed the existence of a single continent beneath Antarctica's polar ice cap and vast mountain ranges above sea level. Discoveries along the way included the British team finding a 7,000-foot mountain range, and the New Zealanders discovering a 9,000-foot range . The telegraph from the Queen after their exploration said: 'You have made a notable contribution to scientific knowledge and have succeeded in a great enterprise' Sir Ernest Shackleton famously attempted the mission during his ill-fated Endurance voyage. The book, released one hundred years after he set out, celebrates the men who succeeded where he had failed and rewrote the history books . The book, published by Thames and Hudson, includes over 150 photographs, in black and white and colour. The pictures bring to life the day-to-day moments of the historical expedition, with the stark landscapes providing a sensational backdrop to the events. The crossing of Antarctica begins with an introduction by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, and the core chapters detail George Lowe's own account of what he experienced of the trip. Fuchs and 11 other men left a base camp on the New Zealand sector of the Antarctic in late November 1957 and began the overland crossing, and would eventually arrive at the pole on January 19, 1958 . Some of the pictures were taken at –50°C (–58°F) and many are seen for the first time. Sadly, Lowe died before the book was completed, but it stands as a testament to the remarkable explorer . Bunny and his team were knighted for their trip, which included crossing 2,500 miles of harsh terrain in the world's most hostile climate . One of our Sno-Cats, Haywire, was returned by ship to London and then went on a tour of towns all over England, arranged by  major sponsor, British Petroleum. Here Bunny is speaking to a crowd of people in Trafalgar Square on May 14, 1958 . Many polar experts and explorers also add their reflections in the book on Antarctica, and the meaning and art of true exploration. They include Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Peter Fuchs, Jonathan Shackleton, Børge Ousland, Sebastian Copeland, Ken Blaiklock, Felicity Aston and Paul Dalrymple .","Vivian Fuch led his team of explorers on an overland expedition of Antactica via the South Pole .

"Spacewalking astronauts ventured out for the third time in just over a week on Sunday to complete a tricky cable job at the ISS. In one stunning shot, Terry Virts revealed the enormity of the station against the darkness of space as his fellow astronaut, Butch Wilmore, floated almost unseen. 'Can you spot the space walker in this picture?' Virts tweeted. 'He's very small compared to the enormous starboard truss of the #ISS'. Scroll down for video . In one stunning shot, Terry Virts revealed the enormity of the ISS against the blackness of space as his fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore prepared the station for future 'space taxis'.'Can you spot the space walker in this picture?' Virts tweeted. 'He's very small compared to the enormous starboard truss of the #ISS' Virts also posted a space selfie and commented: 'Mission Accomplished - three #spacewalks, 800' of cable, four antennas, three laser reflectors, one greased robotic arm.' But not everything went to plan. Dramatically, right before Sunday's spacewalk, engineers spotted problems with American astronaut Butch Wilmore's suit. While it had functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks, on Sunday morning, a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out. A mechanical gauge, however, was operating fine. Mission Control told Wilmore that he would need to pay extra attention to how his suit was feeling throughout the seven-hour excursion. Commander Barry 'Butch' Wilmore is circled in red. The astronauts completed installing 400 feet of cable and several antennas associated with the Common Communications for Visiting Vehicles system known as C2V2 . Terry Virts took a space selfie, moments after completing the job. He wrote on Twitter: 'Mission Accomplished - three #spacewalks, 800' of cable, four antennas, three laser reflectors, one greased robotic arm' The beautiful shot was taken on Sunday during a spacewalk in which astronaut's laid cables in preparation for future space taxis on the ISS. Terry Virts wrote: 'The camera doesn't do it justice - floating in space, looking down on creation, seeing new colour shades' Meanwhile, Nasa said a small amount of water got into American astronaut Terry Virts helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurised on Wednesday. They were forced to spend two days analysing his suit after the water leak occurred at the end of an outing earlier this week. Engineers concluded it was the result of condensation, and a safe and well understood circumstance that had occurred several times before with the same spacesuit. Virts was never in danger, according to Nasa, so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks, Friday, to install cable. But in 2013, another astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet. Italian astronaut, Luca Parmitano, barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk. The water escaped from his suit's cooling system and Nasa spent months investigating the mishap, before clearing the way for more spacewalks. On Wednesday, the amount of water seepage in Virts' helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when Virts was already inside. 'They're very different occurrences,' said Alex Kanelakos, a spacewalk officer in Mission Control. The advance work, involving nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks was carried out to create new crew capsules commissioned by Nasa. The work, done by American astronauts Virts and Wilmore, meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed, as well as two antennas installed on Sunday. A pair of docking ports will fly up later this year, followed by the capsules themselves, with astronauts aboard, in 2017. Terry Virts (right) is seen during the third spacewalk outside the International Space Station Sunday during the six hour, 45 minute outing, in which he helped set up antennas and communications equipment. The left image shows Butch Wilmore fixing cables . Terry Virts wrote on this image: 'Out on the P3 truss. #AstroButch handing me his cable to install on the new antenna'. Dramatically, right before Sunday's spacewalk, engineers spotted problems with American astronaut Butch Wilmore's suit . Nasa on Friday cleared Virts' spacesuit, pictured, for the last of three spacewalks to install cable. Nasa hasn't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days, and the amount of cable work is unprecedented . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. The astronauts successfully routed 364 feet on their first two excursions, on February 21 and last Wednesday. They carried out complicated work Sunday, yet the astronauts completed their task an hour early making it a five and a half-hour spacewalk. They spent 20 hours altogether on three outings. Neither Virts nor Wilmore experienced any more suit trouble during their task. Mission Control joked by radio: 'You guys have done an outstanding job even for two shuttle pilots.' The 260-mile (418-kilometre) spacewalk unfolded 50 years to the month of the world's first spacewalk by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov on March 18, 1965. Nasa hasn't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days, and the amount of cable work is unprecedented. Even more spacewalks will be needed once new docking ports start arriving in June. Wilmore is due to return to Earth next week following a five and a half-month mission. Virts is midway through his expedition. A Russian Soyuz spacecraft carried them both up, with Nasa paying for the multimillion dollar tickets. To save money and stop being so reliant on the Russian Space Agency, Nasa has hired Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the space station. The two contracts are worth nearly $7 billion. SpaceX already is delivering cargo under a separate agreement with Nasa. An astronaut is pictured at the International Space Station, the spacewalk is the third in eight days for Nasa, and is the 187th in the history of the space station .

"The man serving a life sentence for the murder of Joanna Yeates in 2010 has been found guilty of a string of sex offences after police found more than 100 images of child pornography on his laptop. Vincent Tabak was jailed in 2011 after strangling Miss Yeates and dumping her body in the snow on the outskirts of Bristol. Police seized his laptop as part of the investigation into her death and found 145 indecent images of children stored on it. Before admitting to possessing the child pornography, Tabak, 37, protested he would not receive a fair trial because his previous crime was so high profile. Guilty plea: Joanna Yeates's killer Vincent Tabak had admitted four counts of posessing child pornography after images were found on a laptop. He was jailed in 2011 after strangling the 25-year-old and dumping her body in snow . A judge rejected his argument, jailing him for 10 months at Bristol Crown Court, where he was found guilt of murder four years ago. The court heard how the paedophile had stored more than 100 images of children on the computer, with the youngest among them of younger than 10. Flanked by security guards, he held his head in his hands in the dock as the court heard how he had a 'perverse interest in child pornography.' In 2011, at the same court house, Tabak was convicted of killing 25-year-old Joanna Yeates after becoming obsessed with her. The 25-year-old's body was found covered in snow on the outskirts of Bristol . The pair were neighbours, with Miss Yeates living in the groundfloor flat next door to his where, jurors were told, he had watched violent pornography. After spurning his advances Miss Yeates was killed and dumped by the side of the road in Failand on the outskirts of the city. The jury heard how in the months before Jo’s death Tabak had viewed violent porn websites showing women being controlled by men, with images of them bound, gagged and held by the neck and choked. Others showed a woman who looked chillingly like his victim. Miss Yeates's frozen body - which had suffered 43 separate injuries - was found in a similar position to a woman in one pornographic film. In 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service announced they would pursue charges relating to child pornography. His guilty plea today came after a failed attempt by his legal team to have the case thrown out. They claimed he would not face a fair trial in and that he would not be given an additional prison sentence. Dean Armstrong QC, on behalf of Tabak, argued his portrayal in the ITV drama The Lost Honour Of Christopher Jefferies, who was wrongly accused of Miss Yeates's murder, would prevent fairness. Judge Neil Ford QC rejected the argument after telling the court it was not his position to comment on the CPS decision to prosecute. He also discounted the argument that putting Tabak on the Sex Offenders' Register would be pointless as it would have lapsed by the time of his release. Speaking after the sentencing, temporary assistant chief constable Julian Moss of Avon and Somerset Police said prosecution had been 'crucial'. Tabak's legal team argued he would not face a fair trial over the child pornography charges because of his portrayal in an ITV drama about Christopher Jefferies (right) who was wrongly accused of the murder and later successfully sued national newspapers for libel . Following his arrest for the murder of Joanna Yeares, Tabak's former girlfriend told police of his haul of pornography . 'Vincent Tabak is a dangerous, calculating and manipulative offender who is already serving a life sentence for the murder of Joanna Yeates. 'During the course of the investigation into Joanna's murder, indecent images of children were found on Tabak's laptop. These offences did not form part of the initial murder trial. 'Although he's serving a minimum tariff of 20 years' imprisonment, we felt it was crucial Tabak was brought to justice for possessing indecent images of children, so the full nature of Tabak's offending is on record.' Mr Moss said the conviction meant an 'extensive range' of protective measure could be put in place to manage his behaviour and protect those at risk. 'It's possible he may return to the Netherlands following release, so it's crucial the Dutch authorities are aware of the risks he poses,' Mr Moss added. 'This could only have been guaranteed if a relevant conviction relating to a sexual interest in children were secured. 'Joanna's murder was a shocking and terrible crime which had a significant impact on the whole of the Bristol community and I hope this latest conviction will ensure her killer is unable to cause any further harm.'

"This baby otter is being cared for at a rescue center after it became separated from its mother and was washed up on the shore. The sea otter pup was discovered alone on a beach in Monterey, California, and was taken to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Sea Otter Program. Professional wildlife photographer, Sebastian Kennerknecht, captured the journey a rescued otter goes through until it can be released back into the wild. Scroll down for video . This baby otter is being cared for at a rescue center in California after it became separated from its mother and was washed up on the shore . The sea otter pup was discovered alone on a beach in Monterey, California, and was taken to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Sea Otter Program . The 29-year-old from Berkeley, California said: 'The otter pup was found stranded on a beach, with the mother nowhere to be seen. 'Without her, the pup cannot survive by itself. It needed to be brought to the Sea Otter Program to have any chance of survival.' The images show Karl Mayer, the animal care coordinator for the aquarium, bathing the two-week-old male otter after it was brought in. Mr Kennerknecht said: 'He wears a disguise to keep the pup from associating humans with the care it received. 'This ensures that the pup won't try to seek help or try to get food from humans once it is released as an adult at the end of the rescue process. 'The pup is placed in a tank to get used to the feeling of water. It is placed in this specific tank since its very secluded, quiet, and dark, giving the pup a chance to calm down after the stress of being separated from its mother and from the rescue. The Sea Otter is wrapped in fake kelp while floating in holding tank. In the wild otters wrap themselves in kelp to stop them being swept away . A male sea otter being released by Karl Mayer in Monterey Bay . 'He is then wrapped in fake kelp like that found in the Monterey Bay. The fake kelp is placed around the otter pup to start teaching the pup to wrap itself in it to keep from floating away. 'This is crucial otter behaviour in the wild, as the waves could sweep the otter away, which is probably what happened when the pup was separated from its mother. 'The pup is then taken out of the tank and Karl has given the brush to it to play with while he dries it. 'After drying it, Karl will brush it. This is incredibly important since sea otters don't have any blubber to keep them warm. 'Instead they have the thickest fur out of any mammal, but to make sure that the fur keeps them warm they need to groom it, or have it be groomed, which is something the mother normally does at this age of the pup.' Otters taken to the aquarium are not given names to stop the staff from getting too attached to them. If the otters and staff bonded it would make the process of releasing them into the wild more difficult. Another otter, an adult male, is seen being released by Karl into the wild at Elkhorn Slough in Monterey Bay after spending 11 and a half months at the aquarium. Mr Kennerknecht said: 'Getting to photograph the Sea Otter Program is an incredible experience and seeing the dedicated people care for these animals is inspiring. 'The first thought that come to mind when I saw the pup was 'can I keep it', after which I quickly thought about how sad it was that it had been separated from its mother. 'But when I saw it being released back into the wild, and subsequently playing in the surf, I realized that is where it truly belongs and was extremely overjoyed.'","Sea otter pup was discovered alone on a beach in Monterey, California .

"The orthodontic braces that have plagued teens for decades have become spring's most surprising new beauty trend. The once dreaded orthodontia was seen on the catwalk last month during New York Fashion Week, while CR Fashion Book's Editor-in-Chief Carine Roitfeld had 17-year-old model Kitty Hayes flaunt her mouth full of metal on the cover of the magazine's latest issue. 'After putting Beyoncé on my cover last season, I knew there was no way to top the most famous and beautiful woman in the world,' she told WWD. 'So I went in the opposite direction: I chose my favorite fresh faces of the season…girls who are mostly unknown but have a special quality that sets them apart, like big ears or a strange smile.' Unique beauty: Model Kitty Hayes, 17, shows off her metal braces featuring powder blue bands for the latest issue of CR Fashion Book . She continued: 'To me, these models are fascinating because of their imperfections. They represent the new guard of jolie laide - my way of seeing beauty for 2015.' And Kitty isn't the only teen model sporting orthodontia. Last month, New York Times style reporter Matthew Schneier shared a photo of British model Charlie James, 17, smiling and displaying his braces at Opening Ceremony's fall/winter 2015 show. 'Newbie model Charlie James, 17. His braces won't come off till he's 20. I'm encouraging him to make that his brand,' Mr Schneier captioned the picture.

Meanwhile, Hood by Air designer Shayne Oliver put his own spin on the teeth straightening devices by sending his models down the runway wearing grills with braces and locks. Even though the fashion industry seems to be embracing orthodontia with opens arms, it's not always easy being a model with a mouth full of metal. Kitty revealed to CR Fashion Book that the metal wiring and power blue bands that she so proudly shows off for the magazines sixth issue were also the cause of her most embarrassing moment. 'Recently I had a really important casting but when I came out I looked in the mirror and found that I had spinach in my braces!' she explained.

Although braces may be this season's newest trend, celebrities have been sporting their teeth straightening orthodontia on the red carpet for years. Gwen Stefani, Faith Hill, Tom Cruise and Faye Dunaway are among the A-listers who have been photographed wearing braces at some point in their careers. Gwen explained to Harper's Bazaar in 2012 that braces were a gift that she gave herself when No Doubt made it big. 'I always told myself when I got rich, that's the first thing I'd do,' she said.

"Dr Hilary Cass, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health which commissioned the research, called for the government to take action on childhood obesity . Nearly two-thirds of people want TV adverts for food high in fat, sugar and salt banned before the watershed, says a study. Nine out of 10 would also like to see better teaching about how to eat healthily in schools, according to research commissioned by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Its president, Dr Hilary Cass, called for the government to take action as Britain has the highest rate of childhood obesity in Western Europe. She said that focus on care for the elderly should not mean that issues surrounding children's health should fall by the wayside. The survey found more than three-quarters of people said that child death rates, reducing rates of childhood cancer and ensuring consistent health service provision for children and young people should be the top child health priorities for government. Dr Cass said: 'We often see policies hitting the headlines that are targeted at the ageing population - increased funding for dementia research and additional dementia training for NHS workers are among the pledges that have been made in recent weeks. 'But whilst caring for our ageing population is important, it shouldn't mean that children's health falls to the wayside. 'This poll shows that the voting public care as much about child health as they do care for the elderly. 'I call on the next government to listen to the facts and listen to the public - make child health a priority. Not only does it make strong moral sense, it makes economic and political sense too.' Nearly two-thirds of people want TV adverts for food high in fat, sugar and salt banned before the watershed, says a study (file picture) Most people in the study said that children's healthcare should be just as an important priority for the NHS as elderly care. More than half also supported policies to support children's mental health and to reduce the national speed limit in built up areas to 20mph to attempt to reduce deaths from road traffic accidents. Along with 64 per cent of the 2,118 people asked saying they supported the ban on advertising unhealthy food before 9pm, more than three in five  said increasing the amount of money spent on research to improve children and young people's health should be a high priority.","A study found two thirds of people want junk food ads banned before 9pm .

"Any pending legal appeals will not delay the execution of the Bali Nine duo and the eight other drug smuggles, the Indonesian Attorney General has confirmed. This comes as Bali's chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso announced Australian death row inmates Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be moved to 'Death Island' where they will be executed this week. HM Prasetyo also confirmed that the preparations for the mass death by firing squad were '95 per cent' ready as Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers are planning to lodge an appeal within the next week. Scroll down for video . Final journey: The strain shows on the faces of Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right), pictured in Kerobokan prison this week in Kerobokan prison with Indonesia's human rights commissioner Natalius Pigai (centre) who can do nothing to save them from execution which now seems set for this weekend . In waiting: Seen from the waters off Nuskambangan in central Java this is the police station on the 30km long island which houses seven prisons, including Batu or 'stone' prison where special isolation cells have been prepared for the Australian Bali 9 duo ahead of the deaths by firing squad . However, HM Prasetyo said following the clemency plea rejection there were no more 'no more legal avenues left', The Sydney Morning Herald reported. 'Regarding the transfer (of Chan and Sukumaran), it will be done as soon as possible,' he said. 'It's all related to technical issues. Maybe there are still some things that need to be prepared. As an Indonesian battleship is due to arrive in the waters off Nusakambangan island in southern central Java, Mr Samiarso said that for the first time Attorney General M. Prasetyo had issued him with an order to to move the Bali Nine duo to the island. He said a meeting would take place on Monday to set the date of the transfer. Before they depart, Chan and Sukumaran will take part in a Hindu ceremony at Kerobokan prison in Bali at which offerings of flowers and food will be given and prayers will be made asking for the blessing of the gods. Grisly business: Dressed in civvies to play their roles as Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, two police officers from Indonesia's mobile brigade take part in a dress rehearsal for the men's removal to Nusakambangan island for their execution along with eight other drug traffickers . The two Australians have a 900km journey from Bali where they have lived for the last decade, west to the port town of Cilacap from where they will be transferred to the prison island and place of their execution, Nusakambangan . This comes as gruesome details of the planned executions comes to light. The two Australians and eight others will be executed in similar fashion to five foreigners and an Indonesian woman killed by firing squad on the island on January 18. Four of the  prisoners were strapped to wooden planks with a type of rubber used to make the inside of car tyres. Indonesian Rani Andriani aka Melisa Aprilia, opted not to be attached to a board, saying in a written submission beforehand 'submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'. Last rites: Kerobokan prison (pictured, this week) will hold a special Hindu ceremony for Chan and Sukumaran asking the gods to bless the men before they make their final journey to their deaths . Is all hope lost? Bali's chief prosecutor says he is now certain that Myuran Sukumaran (above, left) and Andrew Chan (right) will be moved from Bali to Nusakambangan Island this week to be out to the firing squad . A masked member of the mobile paramilitary brigade 'Brimob' armed with an assault rifle will be among 22 officers who will accompany Chan and Sukumaran from Kerobokan prison to Denpasar airport, which they last saw ten years ago on arrival for their ill-fated heroin smuggling trip . These armed personnel carriers belonging to the Indonesian special police will be used in the transfer of the two Australians to Bali's airport whereupon they will be placed in Sukhoi jets and likely flown straight to Cilacap, which is just a short trip to their place of execution, Nusakambangan . Another woman, Vietnamese Tran Thi Bich Hanh who was executed on the same night but at Boyolali on the mainland in central Java, said in a final submission, 'whenever God wants me to die I am ready'. News emerging from Cilacap, the nearest port to Nuskambangan island, is that the town is filling up with Indonesian Navy special forces. Mr Samiarso said Nuskambangan, which houses seven prisons amid thick rain forest on the 30km long island, was now ready to receive Chan and Sukumaran. 'Everything is ready,' he said, reports Nine news, 'it will be this week for sure.' Indonesian police carry out an ant-terrorist drill at Pasir Putih prison, the 'supermax' of Nuskambangan's seven correctional facilities on the island where Chan and Sukumaran are due to be shot this week . After weeks of deadly anticipation it appears that Nusakambangan, where police were pictured (above) this week taking part in an anti-terrorist drill is finally ready to carry out the deaths by firing squad of ten drug traffickers including the Australians Chan and Sukumaran . Indonesia plans to  hold the Australians and eight other convicted drug traffickers in one of the island's prisons before they are simultaneously killed by firing squads in the middle of the night. The prisons boss for Central java provence, Ahmad Yuspahruddin,confirmed last week that special isolation cells had been prepared for the Australian pair or Batu, or 'stone' prison away from the jail's other inmates weho weren't on death row. The transfer of Chan and Sukumaran to Nusakambangan, which had been predicted more than a week ago, was delayed by the logistics of carrying out the execution of ten people at once. Myuran Sukumaran pictured in 2006 just after the death sentence had been passed on him and Andrew Chan, less than a year after the pair and the seven drug mules they consigned to carry 8.3kg of heroin into Australia had been caught and jailed . The men spent time with family members, although Sukumaran's father, Sam and siblings, brother Chinthu and sister Brinthe returned to Australia on Sunday. Last Friday, Indonesia's mobile paramilitary brigade, Brimob, who will carry out the executions, staged a dress rehearsal in Bali to demonstrate how the Australian drug smugglers will be transferred from Kerobokan jail to the execution island. In the exercise, 22 heavily-armed officers clad in balaclavas took the 'prisoners', played by two police officers, on and off a military plane, represented by a bus. If Mr Samiarso's statement is correct, pleas for clemency by Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop and, in a phone call directly to Indonesian president Joko Widowo, Prime Minister Tony Abbott, havefallen on deaf ears. Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 34, were the leaders of an 8.3kg heroin trafficking ring dubbed the 'Bali 9' who were convicted of attempting to smuggle the drugs out of Indonesia to Australia in 2005. They were sentenced to death in February 2006 and have been living in Kerobokan prison. The other eight due to face the firing squad are: Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, Serge Areski Atlaoui of France, Martin Anderson of Ghana, Indonesian Zainal Abidin, Silvester Obikwe of Nigeria and Rodrigo Gularte, a paranoid schizophrenic man from Brazil whose family has desperately fought to be transferred to a hospital.","Bali prosecutor says Australians will definitely be moved to island for execution .

"Newly released The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is every bit as starry as the first film, with Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith and Richard Gere centre stage. But India plays its supporting role with equal charm and grace. Painted elephants, marble palaces, magnificent forts, wandering cows, pale pink turbans and flickering candles tell of the noise, smells and rich colours of this flamboyant country. The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was filmed in amid the beautiful backdrop of Jaipur in Rajasthan . Filmed in Rajasthan, the film is based in its capital, Jaipur. But ask any resident of the city about the film and you'll be met with a blank stare. Our wonderful guide, Rajendra, was aware of it only because a client had pointed out 'the apparently very famous Judi Dench' in the Rambagh Palace Hotel. Bollywood not Hollywood still rules the screens here. While it might be too late to see Richard Gere in the crowded alleyways of the bazaars, you will spot plenty of other desirable items. Jaipur is a shopper's paradise and Indians flock here for silks and the region's hand-made, block-printed cottons. The magnificent Amber Fort, to which you can ride on an elephant, offers panoramic views over Maota Lake and the ornamental gardens that seem to float within . This is also considered the place to come for jewels. The stones are not mined here, but cut, polished and set better than anywhere else. Visit the iconic jeweller of Jaipur, the Gem Palace, one-time court jewellers to the Mughal emperors and run by the Kasliwal family since 1852. Here are ruby chandelier earrings, enamel rings with floral mughal designs and moonstone necklaces.

You can watch them being worked on in their basement workshop, using skills that have been passed down the generations. For inexpensive sparkle, head to Bangle Lane (Maniharon ka Rasta) in the old city, where you can choose from a multitude of colourful lac bangles for a handful of rupees. Made from resin produced by the female lac insect, they are embedded with mirror pieces, stones, beads or painted. For fashion, Hot Pink is the most sophisticated venue, with high-collared men's waistcoats and moccasins in all hues, as well as kaftans and shawls. The best block-printed fabrics, a craft that dates back to the 1700s, are at Riddhi Siddhi, where cloth is piled from floor to ceiling. Wander, too, through the spice market, past paan wallahs filling betel leaves and the flower market, where scented roses, fragrant jasmine and marigolds are made into garlands to offer to your favourite deities. The Pink City is so-called for its coloured wash, intended to replicate Indian sandstone, a more noble material than the lime and mortar of which the buildings are actually made. With its city gates and crenellated walls, it makes for a striking sight. There are iconic landmarks, such as the five-storey, 18th-century Palace of the Winds, with its latticed screen facade allowing street life to be viewed by the veiled ladies within. Before 1727, when Sawai Jai Singh II created Jaipur, the City of Victory, neighbouring Amber, was the capital.

Dating back to 1829, this was once the British residency and later home to the polo-playing Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II, who entertained the Queen, Lord Mountbatten, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and Jacqueline Kennedy. Their names adorn some of the 14 suites in the palace's new chapter as a hotel managed by Sujan Luxury. The first first film follows a group of elderly character as they explore their respective retirement plans in India and fall in love with the beautiful landscape in the process . The decor, by acclaimed designer Adil Ahmad, offers vivid turquoises and shocking pinks, gilded mirrors and sweeping marble staircases - but, sadly, not Richard Gere. TRAVEL FACTS .

"He wants to be the most powerful man in the country. But according to his local paper, Ed Miliband isn't even the most powerful man in Doncaster, where he is an MP. In a blow for the Labour leader, he has been ranked just fourth in the town's Power List, behind more influential figures like the mayor and One Direction's Louis Tomlinson. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband isn't even the most powerful man in Doncaster, where he is an MP, according to his local paper . The Doncaster Free Press released its Power List last week, ranking the 50th most formidable names in the South Yorkshire town. Mr Miliband has been MP for Doncaster North since May 2005, but a decade representing the town and now on the cusp of running the country is not deemed significant enough to topple more significant local dignitaries. Ros Jones, the elected Mayor of Doncaster, topped the charts as the most powerful person in the town. The former public sector accountant, first elected in 2013, is a keen marathon runner and a school governor. Second on the list was Jo Miller, chief executive of Doncaster Council. Third place went to Louis Tomlinson, the One Direction star who grew up in the town and last year launched a doomed bid to by Doncaster Rovers football club.

Ros Jones, the elected Mayor of Doncaster, (left) topped the charts as the most powerful person in the town. Second on the list was Jo Miller, chief executive of Doncaster Council . Mr Miliband did manage to sneak into fourth place, just ahead of Chris Burton, editor in chief of South Yorkshire Newspapers. Mr Miliband's history in Doncaster was laid bare earlier this year in the memoirs of former Mayor Martin Winter. It included an incident in which he nearly killed himself when he accidentally set fire to Mr Winter's office and, inexplicably, bought the family a £25 Muslim prayer mat for Christmas to cover the hole burnt in the carpet. Mr Miliband also nearly missed a meeting with Gordon Brown when he locked himself into his own house. The Labour leader later tried to ridicule one of Mr Winter's most damaging revelations, that he Miliband told him in October 2007 - a year before the UK financial crash - that the British economy was about to 'fall off a cliff'. It was claimed that Labour had wanted to call an early election to cling to power before voters found out. 'I am apparently Mystic Mili,' said the Labour leader sarcastically. 'I kept the global financial crisis from everyone and revealed it to only one person - not the head of the World Bank, the IMF, or the governor of the Bank of England, but someone at the epicentre of global finance - the mayor of Doncaster.'","Labour leader ranked fourth by his local paper in town where he is MP .

"The former son-in-law of late actor John Cassavetes allegedly kidnapped and raped a teenager in his remote trailer. Buck Wylde Murphy, 49, who was formerly married to Cassavetes' daughter, actress-writer Alexandra 'Xan', was arrested last week after he was discovered holding a 16-year-old girl captive at his trailer in the Californian desert. The 49-year-old allegedly lured the girl, from Staten Island, New York, to San Bernardino County by pretending he was a 19-year-old boy during online chats. Buck Wylde Murphy age 49, pictured last week in his booking photo, allegedly held a teenage victim against her will by threat of force, and sexually assaulted her in California . Actor John Cassavetes with actress wife Gena Rowlands (pictured in 1980). The couple's former son-in-law, Buck Wylde Murphy, was arrested last week over the alleged rape of a 16-year-old girl in California . Buck Wylde Murphy, 49, was arrested last week after allegedly luring a 16-year-old to a remote part of San Bernardino County, California (pictured), holding her captive in a trailer and raping her . He sent her a recording of a song which, when she opened, contained a virus that allowed him to access her personal information. Murphy then allegedly threatened to kill her family unless she flew to meet him. She went to California on February 22, leading her mother to get in touch with police. Police were unable to help so the woman got in touch with a private investigator who managed to track down the suspect. The girl was held at the trailer for five days and sexually assaulted, according to authorities. Detectives from the Rancho Cucamonga Police Department initiated an investigation into a teenaged Staten Island runaway and determined she had been in contact with Murphy since she arrived in California . The alleged victim's mother told The New York Post: 'I was hoping for the best, but when her phone was turned off and I couldn't get a hold of her, I was afraid of the worst.' Finally detectives from the Rancho Cucamonga Police Department initiated an investigation into the girl, whom it was believed had traveled to California. Detectives from the Human Trafficking Detail and Apple Valley Police Department helped and at approximately 9:10 p.m., on February 26th, detectives located the 16-year old and Murphy in his RV at the Horseman’s Center in Apple Valley. Authorities then determined that Murphy had lured the juvenile to California and arranged for her travel. Once in California, the victim was held against her will by threat of force, and sexually assaulted by Murphy over the course of several days. Murphy was arrested and booked into the High Desert Detention Center for the  crimes and is being held on $1,000,000. bail. Detectives are concerned there may be other victims. His ex-wife Alexandra Cassavetes is the daughter of John Cassavetes and actress Gena Rowlands. John Cassavetes starred in movies including The Dirty Dozen and Rosemary’s Baby.

"A damning report into one of the NHS’s worst scandals is today expected to reveal up to ten missed opportunities to intervene to prevent poor care. The independent inquiry will be highly critical of how, despite a string of baby deaths, watchdogs gave an NHS trust the all clear only one month before the last general election. Today’s report is expected to conclude that between 2004 and 2011 there were a series of missed chances to step in at every level, from the hospital to the Department of Health. Tragedy: Joshua Titcombe was nine days old when he died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics at Furness General Hospital, Cumbria . Up to 30 babies and mothers are thought to have died because of failings by midwives and doctors at Furness General Hospital in Barrow. Investigators are thought to have examined around 50 cases where poor maternity care has been alleged. The findings will again put Labour in the dock over its stewardship of the health service, revealing appalling care over years under the last government. The official report into care at the unit, run by University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, will paint a damning picture of what went wrong, with echoes of the Mid Staffs hospital scandal, according to Whitehall sources. Former Labour health secretary Andy Burnham was informed about concerns over maternity care at Morecambe Bay in January 2010. Up to 30 babies and mothers died at Furness General Hospital because of failings by midwives and doctors, a damning report is expected to reveal . Locally, the alarm was first raised in 2008 when nine-day-old Joshua Titcombe died on a ward at Furness. An inquest heard midwives and medical staff made ten serious errors that contributed to Joshua’s death, including a failure to detect and monitor an infection. His parents repeatedly asked if he should have antibiotics and complained he was wheezing and not feeding properly. He eventually died from blood poisoning. Medical charts subsequently went missing and the coroner raised suspicions that they may have been deliberately destroyed. Health officials tried to cover up their failure to investigate poor patient care, it is claimed. Mr Burnham, now Labour’s shadow health secretary, has repeatedly denied being made aware of ‘specific warnings’ about the hospital or putting any pressure on the Care Quality Commission to tone down criticism of the NHS ahead of the 2010 election. Grief: James and Hoa Titcombe lost their baby son Joshua in 2008 . But David Morris, Conservative MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, said he was ‘surprised and disappointed’ that Mr Burnham had not been interviewed by the inquiry, chaired by Dr Bill Kirkup, a former Department of Health associate medical director who also served on an investigation into Hillsborough. ‘It’s hard to understand why the inquiry hasn’t listened to parents who wanted Andy Burnham to be questioned,’ Mr Morris said. ‘They should disclose the reasons why they decided not to call him.’ Joshua’s father James Titcombe, who was appointed to the CQC in 2013 to try to prevent a repeat of such tragedies, is also understood to have protested. In an email to Dr Kirkup, seen by the Daily Mail, Mr Titcombe wrote: ‘I do want to put on record that I am very surprised and disappointed that the investigation hasn’t interviewed Andy Burnham. I have… raised with you on many occasions, the evidence from people who were working in the system at the time that there was a culture of “no bad news”. ‘I am sure that your investigation must have uncovered issues relating to some of the external, system and national policy issues that impacted on the way people were behaving at the time.’ Victims’ families reacted with anger when Mr Burnham tried to arrange a meeting ahead of today’s findings. Carl Hendrickson, whose wife and newborn son died, said: ‘None of us were interested. Andy Burnham has hidden under a stone for six years. When Labour said they were weaponising the NHS for the election, it made me want to vomit.’ A spokesman for Mr Burnham said he ‘acted entirely properly’ at all times in relation to Morecambe Bay. He had volunteered to campaigners the fact that information on maternity care at the trust had been included in an annexe to a wider briefing on issues that might be raised in a meeting with a local MP in 2010. A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘The report will dismiss these political allegations and confirm that no Labour health secretary was briefed on Morecambe Bay. It will instead say that the terrible failings, which span this Government and the last one, were very localised.’ An inquiry spokesman said it ‘found no evidence that would have required an interview’ of Mr Burnham.","Up to 30 babies and mothers died at Furness General Hospital .

"A married father murdered a mother-of-two in her apartment before stealing her credit cards and using her car in a hit-and-run, police have said. Lyle Robert London, 38, has been arrested in the murder of Lindsay Brown Holbrook, a 32-year-old divorced mom he knew. She was found dead in her Washington Terrace, Utah home on Friday night. Sheriff's deputies had gone to the apartment after her car was involved in a hit-and-run, but when she failed to answer her door, they entered the home and found her desecrated body inside. She had suffered an apparent trauma but the cause of her death remains under investigation. Her body could have been there for a few days, Fox13 reported. Murdered: Lindsay Brown Holbrook, 32, was allegedly murdered by Lyle Robert London, right, inside her Utah apartment. Her body was found as police investigated a hit-and-run involving her vehicle . Tragic: Holbrook, who was divorced and lives alone, leaves behind her young daughter and son (pictured) Through evidence found in her car and witness accounts, police determined that London had been behind the wheel at the scene of the crash earlier that evening. Authorities say he knew his alleged victim, but would not detail how - only calling them 'associates'. Arrested: London's wife Shuree, 35, has also been arrested on suspicion of obstruction of justice . 'It is believed that he murdered her in her apartment and then tried to conceal the crime,' Weber County Sheriff's Lt. Lane Findlay said in a press release. Although police have not released a motive for the killing, after murdering the woman, London then took her financial cards and completed several fraudulent transactions, Findlay added. He was then involved in the hit-and-run accident near 3000 Washington Boulevard, police believe. A neighbor added to Fox13 that they had seen London going in and out of Holbrook's home in the days before her body was found. London was arrested at his Ogden home on suspicion of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, abuse and desecration of a human body, and unlawful possession and use of a financial card. His wife, 35-year-old Shuree Laness London, was also arrested at a nearby hotel on suspicion of obstruction of justice. She allegedly 'had knowledge of this crime and assisted Mr. London after the fact,' Findlay said in the press release. Both are being held in the Weber County jail. Their Facebook profiles show they have been married for 13 years and have several children together - but Mrs London wrote on February 20 that they were having marital problems. 'I can honestly say we are going through a VERY VERY DIFFICULT time right now,' she wrote on her husband's profile. Family: The couple, pictured with their children, have numerous arrests between them, court records show . Shortly afterwards, she posted a message reading, 'A real relationship is where you can tell each other everything & anything. No secrets, no lies,' adding: 'I worked so hard for nothing.' Court records show that Lyle London has pleaded guilty to several misdemeanor charges since 1999, including possession of drug paraphernalia, intoxication, simple assault, criminal mischief, theft and various traffic violations, the Deseret News reported. His wife pleaded guilty to theft in 2010, as well as several traffic violations. In light of the most recent charges, their friend John Cleveland told Fox13: 'Knowing him and knowing his background that would not surprise me at all.' He added that he had heard London mention Holbrook's name. Facebook shows Holbrook was a mother to two young children, a boy and a girl. Fox13 reported that she was divorced from her husband and that it did not appear the children lived with her. Scene: Her body was found in her first-floor apartment, left, by sheriff's deputies just before midnight on Friday. Authorities have said she apparently suffered trauma but have not yet said how she died . Her family released a statement through the sheriff's office on Sunday afternoon. 'Lindsay was a loving mother, amazing aunt, wonderful sister, and she had an incredible sense of humor,' it said. 'She is loved by a lot of people and will be greatly missed.' An obituary shows that Holbrook's family also lost her younger brother, 27-year-old Nathan Brown, in January 2014. She leaves behind four other siblings. The family has asked for privacy as they grieve and make preparations for her funeral. 'Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to them,' the sheriff's office said.

"North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles more than 300 miles into the sea in what has been called an 'armed protest' against military drills in the South. A spokesman for the secretive state threatened 'merciless strikes' against South Korea and its ally the U.S., which helps conduct the military drills every year and insists they are just defensive. The war between the two Koreas is still active because it ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty, and left a heavily armed two-and-a-half mile wide zone along the border. Making a statement: South Korean TV shows the two missile tests by the North today. The secretive state warned there would be 'merciless strikes' against routine military exercises carried out south of the border . Training: South Korean soldiers begin the annual military exercises near the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas - which despite its name is one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world . North Korea regularly conducts test firings of missiles, rockets and artillery, but they are often timed to express the country's dissatisfaction with actions by Washington and Seoul. The missiles were fired early this morning at the start of military drills which are due to run until the end of April. Fired from the west coast, they flew around 300 miles across the width of North Korea before landing in waters off the east coast, according to South Korea's Defense Ministry. Spokesman Kim Min-seok called the launches an 'armed protest' against the South Korea-U.S. drills and a challenge to peace on the Korean Peninsula. UN resolutions prohibit any ballistic missile test by North Korea, and Mr Kim said Pyongyang appeared intent on triggering a 'security crisis'. 'We will respond sternly and strongly to any provocation,' he added. A statement carried by North Korea's state-run news agency said: 'The situation on the Korean peninsula is again inching close to the brink of a war. Anger: Protesters gathered today near the U.S. Embassy in the South Korean capital Seoul . Uncompromising: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has taken an aggressive stance against the West . 'The only means to cope with the aggression and war by the U.S. imperialists and their followers is neither dialogue nor peace. They should be dealt with only by merciless strikes.' Officials in the North Korean capital Pyongyang claim the drills are 'intolerable aggression' and preparation for an invasion - but South Korea says they are simply routine exercises. The largest element of the two drills that began today is Foal Eagle, an eight-week exercise involving air, ground and naval field training, with around 200,000 Korean and 3,700 US troops. The other is a week-long, largely computer-simulated joint drill called Key Resolve. Around 28,500 American soldiers are deployed in South Korea as deterrence against potential aggression from the North. North Korea has threatened attacks, including nuclear strikes, on the U.S. before, although it has never demonstrated its missiles could reach the U.S. mainland. During the 2013 drills, tension rose amid North Korean rhetoric that included vows of nuclear strikes on Washington and Seoul. North Korea has carried out three nuclear tests - in 2006, 2009 and 2013. In January, the North offered a moratorium on further tests if this year's joint drills were cancelled - a proposal rejected by Washington as an 'implicit threat' to carry out a fourth atomic detonation. Peace talks: There were hopes of the third summit between the Koreas since 1953, but the prospect is dim . Threats: Protesters outside the embassy. People floating anti-Pyongyang flyers by balloon could be targeted . Jeung Young-Tae, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said Pyongyang was unlikely to conduct a fourth test just to protest against the exercises. 'Nuclear tests carry more significance than that,' he said. 'On the other hand, there is the chance of a mid- or long-range missile test. 'I would say that a demonstration that it could deliver a nuclear warhead would be more threatening to the world than an actual nuclear test'. A new research report by U.S. experts published last week estimated that North Korea could be on track to have an arsenal of 100 nuclear weapons by 2020. In a further sign of rising tensions, North Korean state-run website Uriminzokkiri warned today of a fierce response to any attempt by South Korean activists to float anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border by balloon. 'The response might not just be a few shots of gunfire but cannons or missiles,' the website said. The two Koreas floated the possibility earlier this year of holding what would be the third summit between their leaders since the countries were divided 70 years ago. It is not certain whether the meeting will take place because the two countries disagree on terms.","Two short-range missiles fired into the sea off the regime's east coast .

"The brother of Jihadi John was a member of a group dubbed the 'Muslim mafia' in school and admired a controversial Islamic hate preacher, it has been claimed, as the first photographs of Omar Emwazi emerge. The 21-year-old - whose older brother Mohammed was exposed as the infamous ISIS killer last week - is said to have supported Sheikh Khalid Yasin, who was lauded by Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale. Omar had lived with Mohammed, 26, and both went to school together at Quintin Kynaston Academy in north west London, which was also attended by another ISIS member, Choukri Ellekhlifi. Omar Emwazi, 21, was reportedly part of a so-called Muslim mafia in school and looked up to a controversial hate preacher. He is the younger brother of Mohammed Emwazi, revealed last week as the face behind Jihadi John's mask . Omar is said to have quickly taken down his Facebook page after his brother's new identity was revealed last week. He reportedly used the site to 'like' Sheikh Yasin, a preacher who has called the Taliban his 'brothers' and denounced both Christian and Jewish beliefs as 'filth'. Yasin has also claimed that the Koran gives men permission to 'beat women lightly' and has called homosexuality an 'aberration' that should be 'punishable by death'. Michael Adebowale - who was jailed last year for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby - said Yasin's views taught him the 'purpose of life' and convinced him to convert to Islam. Omar is believed to be being questioned in Kuwait, the home country of his father, Jassem, over Mohammed's involvement with ISIS, after they recently returned to the country from their house in west London. A schoolfriend of Omar has said he was part of a group dubbed 'the Muslim Mafia' at Quintin Kynaston because of their devout religious views. The unnamed woman told Victoria Ward of The Daily Telegraph: 'He was very religious but in an unobtrusive way. 'In every year there was a set that was the Muslim Mafia that hung out together and were very religious.' The former schoolfriend insisted Omar was too much of a 'wimp' to be an extremist. Mohammed Emwazi was this week revealed to be ISIS killer 'Jihadi John', seen beheading hostages in videos . He and his younger brother Omar Emwazi both went to Quintin Kynaston Academy in north London. A school friend has said the younger boy was part of a religious clique known as 'the Muslim Mafia' Omar Emwazi is said to have used Facebook to profess his admiration for Muslim hate preacher Sheikh Kalid Yasin (left), who inspired Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale (right) to convert to Islam . The Emwazi family have left their home in north London, which was visited by authorities investigating Mohammed last week . Omar is also said to have been a member of a group called Power of Dawah, who try to convert people to Islam in the street. Quintin Kynaston - which has a large number of Muslim students - is set to undergo a review over how it handled radicalisation among its pupils. The school, which is said to be completely different today from the time when the Emwazis attended, will be investigated by the Department of Education. Its former the former headteacher, Jo Shuter, today insisted staff new nothing of any extreme influence of students. She told Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'm not prepared to say when the radicalisation took place but all I can say is hand on heart that we had no knowledge of it. 'There was never any sense that any of these young men, as I knew them, were ever radicalised at the school.' The Emwazi's father was a member of the 'Bidoun' group of stateless people denied citizenship by countries in the Gulf. He worked as a police officer in Kuwait, where Mohammed was born, until he found his loyalties questioned after Saddam Hussein's 1990-1 invasion of the Gulf State because his family was originally from Iraq. Mr Emwazi took his wife and his children to live in London in 1993, although he later returned and is now living in the Kuwaiti city of Jahra. The family are now in Kuwait, where they are reportedly being questioned by the security services .","Brother Omar went to same London school as infamous ISIS killer .

"Heavy child: Aliya Saleem, of Jharkhand, India, was born at a relatively large 9lbs, then began to rapidly gain weight from the age of four months . A ten-month-old baby has weighed in at a whopping 2st 13lbs - making her one of the heaviest children in the world for her age. Aliya Saleem, of Jharkhand, India, was born at a relatively large 9lbs, then began to rapidly gain weight from the age of four months - and is now as heavy as an average six-year-old girl. Her parents are worried about her health, after another of their children died aged just one-and-a-half after gaining weight in a similar fashion. The girl's mother Shabana Parveen, 25, said: ‘A few months after her birth, she starting gaining weight. We had to buy her a new pair of clothes every two weeks because the old ones become too tight for her.’ The enormous weight has put Aliya's life in danger, but the family have lacked the money to obtain good enough medical care for her. Her father Mohammad Saleem, 28, said: ‘We have tried our best, but we could only afford to take her to the local hospital. 'The doctors in the village could not tell us clearly what she is suffering from. We took Aliya to a doctor in Ranchi. After the check up the doctor suggested that we go to another city, but we couldn't afford that so we didn't take her.’ However, Aliya's parents recently managed to get a consultation at Fortis Hospital on the outskirts of Delhi in a bid to try and get to the bottom of their daughter's massive weight gain. Dr Krishan Chugh, head of paediatrics at Fortis, said: ‘This is the heaviest baby at ten months of age that I have seen. This could be case of morbid obesity or even a hormonal imbalance.

Relative values: The enormous weight has put Aliya's life in danger, but the family have lacked the money to obtain good enough medical care for her. She is pictured above with her wider family . ‘But we need to conduct some tests on her before making a proper diagnosis. The treatment depends on the diagnosis that we make. 'There are some disorders that can be treated. As far as the reversal of this weight gain is concerned, that would depend on when we find a cause for it.’ The average weight of a ten-month-old child in the UK is 1st 4lbs - less than half Aliya's weight. Aliya's giant frame poses problems for Mrs Parveen, who struggles to hold her in her lap for very long. She said: ‘She has become very heavy. My husband comes home very late from work. Mother and daughter: The average weight of a ten-month-old in the UK is 18lbs - less than half Aliya's weight . Standard meal for Aliya: Her daily food intake, according to Mrs Parveen, is three times that of a normal child - putting a severe strain on the family's finances . With a local one-year-old girl: Despite her ever-increasing weight, Aliya is the favourite baby in the village . ‘So all through the day, I have to do household chores and also look after Aliya. It is difficult because she cannot even sit still on her own. ‘She keeps crying throughout the day. She wakes up at night abruptly and also she cannot breathe properly.’ Mrs Parveen and her husband have another son - five-year-old Ali - who is of regular weight, but has been unable to attend school due to their financial difficulties. Their older daughter, Simran, died aged just one-and-a-half after gaining weight in a similar fashion to Aliya. Mr Saleem said: ‘Simran had breakfast in the morning. I left for work after that. I got a call that Simran was not well and blood was coming out of her mouth. Biscuit break: Aliya's increasing weight is making her parents nervous about their own financial future . Measurements: Aliya's giant frame poses problems for Mrs Parveen, who struggles to hold her in her lap . Popular with the local children: Mrs Parveen said the family 'had to buy her a new pair of clothes every two weeks because the old ones become too tight for her' ‘We rushed her to the hospital but the doctors told us that her nerves had been damaged and she has passed away.’ Mrs Parveen added: ‘We are scared. Simran kept gaining weight all the time. Just like her, Aliya is also growing. So if we leave her untreated, we fear for the worst.’ Aliya's increasing weight is making her parents nervous about their own financial future too. Her daily food intake, according to Mrs Parveen, is three times that of a normal child - putting a severe strain on the family's finances. ‘We have limited means, so there are instances when I have to borrow money from relatives or friends to feed the family and Aliya,’ said Mr Saleem, who works as a tailor - earning less than £3 a day. But despite her ever-increasing weight, Aliya is the favourite baby in the village. Mrs Parveen said: ‘Everybody in the village loves her. Kids also come and play with her. But very few can lift her.’ Help: Eunice Fandino (left) stands next to her eight-month-old son Santiago Mendoza (right) last year at a clinic in Bogota, Colombia, where the 3st child was put on a diet to help him lose weight .

"An opulent London home that was to be given an extravagant makeover by Italian designer Gianni Versace, who was murdered before he was able to move in, has been put up for sale for £15million. Versace decided on the 18th century four-bedroom home in Charles Street in Mayfair while looking for a London base as he considered floating his fashion empire on the stock exchange in the 1990s. He ordered an overhaul of the inside of the expensive Grade II listed townhouse, which included plans to install a giant diamond patterned marble slab entrance hall and 30-foot high double doors - believed to be the largest of their type in a private home in London. Gianni Versace ordered a radical makeover of a Mayfair mansion he planned to buy, but never got to complete the sale because he was murdered before he could move in. The opulent four bedroom grade II listed property has now gone on the market for £15million . The house (blue door) was to be a London base for Versace who was considering floating his company on the stock market . But the designer never got to live in the palatial home because he was shot dead outside his Miami beach mansion in 1997 by Andrew Cunanan, a serial killer he had met in San Francisco whilst designing costumes for the opera. The purchase of the house was never completed. Following his death the ambitious conversion plans for the property were scaled down and it was quietly sold to a businessman later that year. However the house, which was owned by various members of the aristocracy and wealthy merchants before being converted into offices after World War Two, has retained some of its extravagant elements. A designer kitchen takes up almost the entire lower ground floor and leads into an atrium. While the second floor is dominated by a master bedroom suite which features a large double bedroom opening onto a private balcony, a walk-in dressing room and a large master bathroom with oversize oval bathtub. A kitchen and dining room covers almost an entire floor of the London townhouse, and has been extensively modernised . Wetherell estate agents, who are handling the sale, said the glass back of the mansion makes it particularly unique for prospective buyers . There are three further bedrooms and lifts to all floors, including extensive storage vaults on the lower ground floor. The first floor boasts a reception room with gold leaf ceiling coving along with a marble fireplace and a separate study. The Versace home that never was has now been put on the market with Wetherell estate agents for £15 million and also boasts a 34ft garden. It covers 5,756 sq ft. Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'The Charles Street mansion is a striking fusion of highly traditional and contemporary, with a brick front and a glass back, and inside classic rooms and modern open plan spaces. The 18th century property has four bedrooms and includes lifts to all its floors and was to be extensively redecorated by Versace . The house has a grand sweeping spiral staircase, which links the lower floors to the four bedrooms above including the master suite . The Grade II listed property was owned by various members of the aristocracy and the wealthy and was to be extensively redeveloped . An oval oversize bath tub sits in the bathroom adjoining the master suite of the property, which covers almost an entire floor .

'It will appeal to a buyer who wants a statement home with space to entertain on a large scale . Versace, who died at the age of 50, owned property in Miami, Manhattan and Milan. Last year the Ocean Drive mansion where he was shot dead was reopened as a luxury boutique hotel. The mansion boasts a number of elements that may have been seen in the London home had he had the chance - including a 54-foot 'thousand mosaic' swimming pool lined in 24-carat gold. Cunanan, a 27-year-old ‘high-class’ gay prostitute, was said to be responsible for Versace's murder. After an international manhunt he was was found to have committed suicide in the upstairs bedroom of the Miami houseboat where he had been hiding out.","Gianni Versace chose opulent Mayfair home as his London base as he prepared to float business on stock market .

"Breastfeeding has been shown to have many health benefits, for mother and baby - and Cassandra Fellingham is pleased and proud she was able to breastfeed all three of her children. Yet two years ago, breastfeeding her third baby left Cassandra, 34, suffering from a condition that nearly killed her. She'd developed mastitis, which affects one in ten breastfeeding women and occurs when a milk duct, which transports milk to the nipple, becomes blocked. Milk builds up in the breast, leading to painful inflammation. Cassandra Fellingham got mastitis so bad when she breastfed her third child (r) she nearly died. Pictured with sons Miles, five, and Jensen, two . There are 15 to 20 milk ducts in each breast - these can become blocked for a number of reasons, such as the baby not latching on properly and draining the breast effectively, or feeding irregularly. It can also be caused by pressure from a bra that's too tight. Often, the condition clears up on its own - if the mother continues breastfeeding, this helps to drain the breast, clear the blockage and the problem resolves. However, for some women the stagnant milk becomes infected, causing flu-like symptoms such as aches and shivers. This may happen because bacteria enter the breast through a small crack or break in the skin, or as a result of bacteria in the baby's mouth and throat entering during breastfeeding. In this case, a course of antibiotics is required to clear the infection - mothers can take a type that is safe for babies, allowing them to keep breastfeeding. Cassandra knows these symptoms well - she had mastitis with her first child, Shikiera, now 15, and her second, Miles, now five. 'Both times I'd got pain, then a hardening of the breast, followed by aches and feeling rotten,' says Cassandra, a self-employed PA who lives with her partner and children in Littlehampton, West Sussex. 'I saw my GP and was given antibiotics, which cleared it up within a few days.' The bacteria that had caused the mastitis had spread to her bloodstream . So when Cassandra had her third child, Jensen, now two, and started feeling unwell, she knew what was wrong. 'When Jensen was eight weeks old, I got the familiar pain in my left breast - then I started to ache and feel as if I was coming down with flu. I knew without a doubt this was mastitis again.' She called her GP and, because of her history, the doctor gave Cassandra antibiotics straight away. But whereas with her first two children the medicine worked quickly, this time it did not. 'Over the next two days the pain in my left breast got worse. It was also like the worst flu ever - I was hot, then cold, then dizzy and the aches felt like I'd been kicked. I lay and shivered beneath a blanket.' Luckily, her partner Wayne, 44, an accountant, was able to help look after the other children. Despite her condition, Cassandra was keen to continue breastfeeding. 'I'd read lots about mastitis and knew the best way to clear a blockage was to keep on feeding,' she says. However, three days after the mastitis began, with Wayne out, Cassandra's condition worsened dramatically. 'I started feeling breathless and lay down in bed, but suddenly the room went black. I was slipping in and out of consciousness.' Her quick-thinking daughter, then just 13, grabbed a thermometer and took her mother's temperature - it was 41c. In one moment of lucidity, Cassandra grabbed the phone and called her doctor, who told her to get to A&E. Wayne hurried home and stayed with the other children. Cassandra managed to climb into a taxi. Not wanting to be parted from Jensen, she took him with her to Worthing Hospital. By the time she arrived, she could barely string a sentence together and was hallucinating. She recalls hearing the consultant talk to another doctor and mentioning the word 'sepsis'. 'I was terrified. I knew this was very serious,' she says. Cassandra was raced down to a high-dependency ward and attached to wires to monitor her heart, with a drip inserted for fluids. She was also given two sets of intravenous antibiotics. Blood tests confirmed Cassandra had sepsis - blood poisoning. The bacteria that had caused the mastitis had spread to her bloodstream. For two days, Cassandra battled for her life after being diagnosed with sepsis - blood poisoning . Less than 1 per cent of cases of mastitis lead to sepsis, says Dr Ron Daniels, a critical care consultant and chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust. When sepsis occurs, the body's immune system sets off a series of reactions, including inflammation, swelling and blood clotting, which can mean the blood supply to vital organs is cut off. If it isn't treated quickly, sepsis can lead to organ failure and ultimately death. 'Antibiotics are the single most important thing - if they're delivered in the first hour, then that doubles your chance of survival,' says Dr Daniels. 'But for every hour of delay, the risk of death increases by 8 per cent. 'We estimate that 102,000 people get sepsis every year in the UK. Out of that figure, 37,000 die.' Sepsis is most likely to occur as a result of conditions such as pneumonia, gallbladder complications or urinary tract infections, which are generally more common than mastitis. For two days, Cassandra battled for her life, with distressed family and friends taking turns to sit with her and care for the baby. Reduction in a woman's risk of breast cancer if she breastfeeds her baby . 'Jensen was in his cot by my side,' she says. 'I remember looking at him, so small, and thinking that I had to live.' Nurses held the baby to her breast so he could continue to be breastfed. Finally, on the third day, she turned a corner. 'A consultant came and smiled and told me that the antibiotics had cleared the sepsis. I was going to be all right.' After five days in hospital, Cassandra was allowed home with oral antibiotics. Her breast was still sore, but she carried on breastfeeding. Jensen is now a healthy, happy two-and-a-half-year-old. 'The way I saw it, I was just unlucky that time,' she says. 'Breastfeeding was still the best food for my baby and I wasn't going to let mastitis stop me doing that.' It's not clear why some women get mastitis and others don't, but women who have had it are prone to getting it again - possibly because of the way the mother is feeding. Cassandra wants to raise awareness among breastfeeding women of the dangers of mastitis . To prevent the problem, mothers should ensure the baby is latched on properly and finishes the feed on each side; mothers should also wear a comfortable bra, and get plenty of rest - lowered immunity can raise the risk. If a woman suspects she has mastitis, she should contact her GP immediately because of the risk of infection, and also the risk of an abscess developing, which may need to be drained. With help and support, the problem often resolves itself, says Janet Fyle, midwife and policy adviser for the Royal College of Midwives. 'If a woman develops any pain or lumps, hot showers or cold compresses can help. 'Also, at every feed, she should make sure the baby feeds from each side, to ensure the milk is drained properly. If it does not resolve, she needs to see a GP or a lactation consultant.' If flu-like symptoms develop, this can suggest an infection has developed and antibiotics are needed. However, women can continue to breastfeed, or express milk if it is too painful, she says. 'As long as she is supported and gets advice, there is no reason to stop feeding.' Cassandra wants to raise awareness among breastfeeding women of the dangers of mastitis. 'I'd had it before and so was a bit complacent that it would just pass,' she says. 'I'm so glad I got to hospital when I did or I might not be here now.' Visit sepsistrust.org or lcgb.org for more information .","Cassandra Fellingham, 34, from Littlehampton, developed mastitis .

"They are Britons who have cemented their place in history - but are now in danger of being forgotten. Research suggests that the achievements of luminaries such as JMW Turner, Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Charles Darwin go unrecognised by large parts of the population. In a study commissioned to mark the DVD release of Oscar-nominated film Mr Turner, more than a quarter of people did not know the renowned artist. Cemented in history: Research suggests that the achievements of luminaries such as JMW Turner (left), Sir Isaac Newton (centre) and Sir Charles Darwin (right) go unrecognised by large parts of the population . And more than half could not name any of his masterpieces, such as The Fighting Temeraire. A similar proportion could not say why Newton – who formulated the laws of gravity – or Darwin, a key contributor to evolutionary theory, were famous. Other names that featured in the top ten included leader of Protestant reform William Tyndale, William Wilberforce - who helped abolish the slave trade - Michael Faraday, Oliver Cromwell, Marie Stopes and Sir Francis Drake. Some 29 per cent of Britons did not know that Sir Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, with 15 per cent thinking he created the character of famous spy James Bond.

Research: The study was commissioned to mark the DVD release of the film Mr Turner, starring Timothy Spall . However, other current famous faces are not thought of so highly, with those polled putting comedian Russell Brand on top of a list of Britons they were most likely to feel embarrassed about in future. Katie Price came in second place, receiving 12 per cent of the vote, followed by Katie Hopkins and Prime Minister David Cameron, both with 9 per cent. Ukip leader Nigel Farage took the final spot with 8 per cent. Historian Dr Paul Readman said: ‘The results show there are so many Brits that have shaped the course of history and they seem to have slipped out of our national consciousness.'

"A British clairvoyant warned Abraham Lincoln that his life was in danger weeks before he was assassinated, a historian claims. It is thought Charles Colchester, a medium who was close to the first lady, told the president of the threat in the early months of 1865. Lincoln was shot dead by actor John Wilkes Booth as he watched a play in a private box at Ford's Theatre, Washington DC, on the night of April 14 that year. Assassinated: An illustration shows John Wilkes Booth shooting President Lincoln at Ford's Theatre on April 14, 1865. Clairvoyant Charles Colchester had become close to first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, pictured centre . But while Colchester may have been passing on the information as a mystic warning, it is likely the information came directly from the assassin - who was also his drinking companion. Colchester's relationship with the president has been well-document, but until now historians have not connected him with Booth, Professor Terry Alford writes in Fortune's Fool, a new biography of the assassin, according to The Times. The medium became known to the Lincoln family after he was summoned by first lady Mary Todd Lincoln when she was looking to communicate with her dead 11-year-old son, Willie. Colchester, the illegitimate son of a duke, impressed Mrs Lincoln and was invited to hold a number of seances at the White House and the Soldiers' Home, the president's summer retreat. Warning: Abraham Lincoln, was told his life was in danger weeks before his death, it is claimed . But while he became important to the first lady, it appears he was unable to convince the president of his powers, writes Professor Terry Alford. On one occasion the president asked Joseph Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, to investigate how Colchester was able to summon noises in different parts of a room - evidence, he claimed, of his ability to communicate with spirits. Mr Henry was forced to report that he was unable to find an explanation. (It was later discovered Colchester had an electrical noise-maker strapped to his bicep). His close relationship to the first lady allowed Colchester to become part of the Washington social scene. It was there he met Booth and the two men became friends, writes Professor Alford. 'They would go out and get drunk together,' he told The Times. In the weeks before the assassination, Booth was staying at the National Hotel - less than six blocks from Ford's Theatre. Colchester visited him there often, writes Alford. In early 1865 Booth abandoned his plan to kidnap Lincoln and decided instead to assassinate him. He shared his plot with a number of trusted friends in Washington, but it is not clear whether Booth was one of them. What is known is that, in April 1865 - the month of the assassination - another friend urged the president to be mindful of his personal safety, Lincoln replied: 'Colchester has been telling me that'. Colchester fled Washington after being confronted by a member of the president's inner circle following a blackmail attempt on the first lady. He died in Iowa a few years later. Fortune's Fool: The Life of John Wilkes Booth, will be published in Britain by Oxford University Press on May 28.","Abraham Lincoln was shot dead in Washington DC theatre on April 14 1865 .

"London's latest hipster restaurant serving different versions of just one type of food opened its doors today. And already customers have flocked to the trendy Porridge Cafe which specialises in 25 kinds of porridge made from 11 different grains and features sweet as well as savoury offerings. The brainchild of Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington, the founders of food truck business The Bow Street Kitchen, it's the latest place to turn a seemingly everyday food into a gourmet experience. Customer Holly Mac eating at the Porridge Cafe in Shoreditch, the first of its kind to open in London . Blueberry and apple compote rye porridge served with fresh blueberries, and pumpkin and sunflower seeds . Prices range from £2.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to £7 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings. But it does serve more than just plain bowlfuls of oats. A range of sweet offerings involve typical toppings such as apple, vanilla and hazelnut; strawberry, cinnamon and cranberry and raspberry, peach and almond - the savoury toppings veer towards the unusual. Made with  spelt, arborio rice or grain buckwheat and quinoa, they feature slow-roasted chicken, leek and cream cheese; bacon, avocado and roasted tomato; and salami, pecorino and porcini mushroom. Mr Williamson said: 'Our basic porridge will match Pret's prices. 'Customers will be able to top their basic porridge with sugar, jams or honey for £2.35. A bowl of savoury porridge of slow cooked beef ragu, feta and basil will set you back £6.50 . Customer Victoria Jenkins eats a bowl of porridge at the Porridge Cafe . 'The healthy and sweet porridges, with fruits and seeds, start at £4 while the savoury risottos start at £5.50 for the vegetarian ones. 'The most expensive will be the ones with meat, with prices ranging from between £6 and £7.' The inspiration behind their latest venture came about when the duo were in Scandinavia. Mr Williamson said: 'We were in Copenhagen and we noticed there was a lot of great porridge. We tasted different grains – in Scandinavia they use rye, buckwheat, spelt, barley and quinoa to make their porridge. Grain buckwheat cooked with pomegranate juice and cardamom and served with orange slices, dates and dark chocolate shavings . ‘You would think we were sick of the stuff but the different varieties and incarnations are endless. 'We love how versatile it is and hope we can make people realise that porridge can be so much more than oats and water.’ High fibre, high protein and low GI, porridge has long been known as the perfect food as part of a balanced diet. ‘Eating porridge regularly can also help reduce stress due to the presence of magnesium in many grains,' Mr Williamson added. The partners discovered the huge amount of grains that are used to make porridge all over the world, along with the different methods to make it. They finally decided on 11 grains which they think ‘taste great’. A bowl of mushroom, lemon and fennel porridge (left). The cafe is the brainchild of Nik Williamson (pictured) who opened it with his business partner Elly Harrington . The term 'porridge' is used fairly loosely at Nik Williamson's new cafe in trendy east London . ‘All in all we've chosen 11 grains we think taste great and have some really great health benefits,' he said. ‘The recipes we've developed are sweet, healthy and savoury flavours.' The cafe will open on 2 March on Paul Street, near Old Street station, London, and will serve from 7am to 6pm daily with a daily changing menu. At weekends there will be a brunch menu featuring three savoury and two sweet choices. Initially a pop-up, if the concept proves to be a success, it will become a permanent fixture. 'Our hope is in we will see whether people like it in the initial month and if they will buy our porridge,' Mr Williamson said. 'If it's successful we may extend in the location for a few more months and we will probably widen the menu so there will be other dishes involved.' The Porridge Cafe follows on the heels of London's Cereal Killer and Belfast's Simply Crisp cafe. Just crisps: Businessman Andrew McMenamin opened Belfast's Simply Crispy in January 2015 . Alan and Gary Keery of The Cereal Killer Cafe in Brick Lane serve 120 cereals with 20 toppings and 12 milks . Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened earlier in January was the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin who had planned to keep his  pop-up going for just four weeks. But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open until at least March, and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or even London. 'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door,' Mr McMenamin said. In December 2014 self-confessed cereal obsessives Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk. The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world. The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal.","The Porridge Cafe serves 25 different kinds of the classic oat dish .

"Google has confirmed rumours it will soon be offering mobile network plans. Vice president Sundar Pichai said the firm is working with unnamed operators during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Rumours claim it will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah. Elsewhere, Mr Pichai confirmed Google was working on Android Pay as well as Project Loon, designed to connect more urban areas. Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps, talks during a conference during the Mobile World Congress, the world's largest mobile phone trade show in Barcelona, Spain . Google has confirmed year-long rumours it will be offering mobile network plans in the US. Speaking at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, vice president Sundar Pichai said the tech giant is working with unnamed network operators on developing a cellular plan. ‘You will see us announce it in the coming months, I think we are at a stage where it is important to think about hardware, software and connectability together,’ said the 43-year-old. Mr PIchai also confirmed rumours that Google is working on a payment service and unveiled plans for its Project Loon - designed to connect urban areas. The rumours of a Google mobile network plan first emerged in April last year, and the unnamed networks are believed to be Sprint and T-Mobile in the US. Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing 3G and 4G networks at wholesale prices and sell the connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate. Visitors use their smartphones to take pictures of the new Galaxy S6 Edge displayed inside a glass cabinet, during the Mobile World Congress, the world's largest mobile phone trade show in Barcelona . This would make Google a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) similar to Lycamobile in the US that runs on T-Mobile’s network, and Tesco Mobile in the UK which shares O2’s networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use these network to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Mr Pinchai said: ‘We want to be able to experiment along those lines, [but] we don't intend to be a network operator at scale.’ A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a company that offers mobile service plans using existing networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use this access to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Lycamobile in the U.S, for example, is an MVNO because it runs on T-Mobile’s network. In the UK, Tesco Mobile shares O2’s, and ultimately Telefonica’s, networks. An MVNO is typically run as an independent company, with its own staff and customer service . He described the plans as a ‘project’ and will do it on a small enough scale to not threaten existing networks. In particular, Mr Pichai said the setup should provide at seamless connection between Wi-Fi and mobile networks. Sources said at the time of the original rumours that any Google-branded mobile network would initially launch in cities that have Google Fiber. Google launched its 1000mps Fiber broadband service in 2011, starting with Kansas City. In 2013, the firm announced it was expanding the service to Austin in Texas, Provo in Utah and a number of other towns in Missouri and California. More locations are due to be added later this year, but the roll-out is slow because Google has to install the relevant infrastructure needed. Google Fiber starts at $70 (£42) a month and has been praised for offering high speeds at relatively low prices. Google’s wireless plans would remove some of the costs, and time spent, in setting up its own network and it would equally benefit from using already established and well-connected networks. This could help Google cement itself as an internet service provider. Google could additionally use the network to sell its Nexus range of phones, for example, with contract or service plans. Mr Pichai also used the event to announce the launch of Google Fiber in more urban areas and to announce Project Loon, designed to bring connectivity to rural areas, and Project Titan - a drone version of Loon. He also confirmed Android Pay will be built into its mobile software and will have NFC components, but won’t launch it before Samsung launches its Pay service later this year.","Google confirmed rumours it will soon be offering mobile network plans .

"An armed robber is being sought by police following a smash and grab raid in which he threatened staff with a handgun before stealing a haul of Rolex watches and hijacking a taxi to flee the scene. Thousands of pounds worth of Rolex watches were stolen in the raid at the family-run Laing The Jeweller's in Edinburgh city centre this morning. The incident occurred at about 9.30am and police said the suspect stormed the premises with a handgun before making off with a number of 'high value items'. The armed robber stormed Laing The Jewellers in Edinburgh city centre (pictured) at about 9.30am today and threatened staff with a handgun before making off with a number of 'high value items'. He remains on the run . Officers remain at the scene of the store (above) while investigations continue to trace the suspect. Police said the suspect fled the scene on foot before getting into a private hire car and being driven away from the city . He then fled the scene on foot before entering a private hire car, in which he was driven to the Pilton area of Edinburgh. It is understood there may have been a passenger in the taxi at the time of the car hijacking. Police said the suspect was last seen when he got out of the vehicle in Pilton Drive North. It is believed he is still armed and may have been joined by a number of accomplices. Police said no one at the jewellers, which was founded in 1840 and sells high quality rings and luxury watches, was injured. However, several members of staff were said to be shaken after the incident. Police Scotland has now dispatched officers across the city, particularly in the Pilton area, in the hunt for the suspect. A spokesman said: 'We can confirm we were called to Frederick Street this morning to reports of a robbery taking place. 'Inquiries are still at a very early stage and are ongoing.' Laing confirmed the incident on Twitter this morning, writing: 'We can confirm that an incident took place at our Frederick St store this morning. This is currently being investigated by Police Scotland.' A spokesman for the business also told MailOnline: 'Following the incident in our Frederick Street store this morning, we can thankfully confirm that no-one was injured and some valuable items were stolen. 'It has been a stressful experience for our staff so we have taken the decision to close the store for business for the rest of today and let the police focus on their investigations.' Laing said no one was injured in the raid but said staff were left shocked and it had been a 'stressful experience'. Police have cordoned off the upmarket store, which will remain closed for the remainder of today . Laing The Jewellers took to Twitter this morning to confirm the incident, which is being investigated by police . Businesses across Scotland took to Twitter to offer support to Laing which suffered the armed raid today . It was met with response from other businesses across the city, including Hamilton and Inches which said: 'Thinking about our colleagues at @LaingEdinburgh after the awful robbery this morning. We hope everyone is okay.' Eric n Smith, diamond ring designers, added: '@LaingEdinburgh Sorry to read about what happened this morning. Hope you're all OK.' The suspect is described as being a man in his early 30s, 5ft 10ins tall and wearing a dark padded hooded jacket, blue trousers, a blue and white scarf and carrying a black and white rucksack. Detective sergeant Raymond Gray said: 'This robbery left the staff badly shaken but thankfully unhurt. 'We are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the man, or has information about the crime, so that we can trace him as soon as possible.' It is not the first time the jewellers has been targeted. In January last year, a man walked into the store and grabbed a handful of watches – believed to be worth more than £17,000 – before fleeing the shop. However, the heist was foiled when Ray Mallon, the mayor of Middlesbrough, wrestled the suspect crook to the ground outside the store. He held the man in a headlock until police arrived and made the arrest. Speaking at the time, Mr Mallon said: 'I was looking at some watches in the window of a jewellers shop when I noticed a commotion inside. Suddenly a man came sprinting out the door with two assistants chasing after him. 'What happened next was instinctive, it took me back to the old days. 'I stepped across the man and we grabbed hold of each other and wrestled for a few seconds. I managed to get him in a headlock and we ended up on the ground.' Anyone with information about today's incident which could help police should call 101.","Laing The Jeweller targeted by armed robber in Edinburgh this morning .

"A hotel worker whose  nose was bitten off on the night of his work Christmas party is having it rebuilt using skin from his face. Christopher Watson, 32, admits he was too drunk to remember on a night out with colleagues in Newcastle upon Tyne on December 23, but insists he was attacked. He is currently recovering from reconstructive surgery as doctors battle to repair his disfigured face using grafts from other parts of his head. But police have shelved the investigation into the alleged attack because he was too drunk to remember who attacked him, and where. Anger: Christopher Watson, 32, claims his nose was bitten off, left and right, during his work Christmas party but is furious after police shelved their investigation because he was too drunk to remember what happened . After checking CCTV at possible locations and hunting for witnesses, officers found nothing so were unable to record the incident as a crime and suggested he may have fallen over. Mr Watson fears the person who attacked him may now never be caught and denies he fell because he had no grazes on his hands, elbows or knees. Now he  faces years of surgery to repair his nose, which was so severely damaged people cannot stop staring. Aftermath: Mr Watson says that people keep staring at him because of his injuries . He said: 'It's been awful. People still stare at me wherever I go, in the shop, on the bus, I get people looking at me. 'I just can't get my head around the fact that this has happened to me and I don't know why.' He had been enjoying a Christmas do with his colleagues from Newcastle's Vermont Hotel when the mysterious incident occurred, during the early hours of December 22, 2013. He believes he was attacked near Grey's Monument, outside Fenwick department store, in Newcastle city centre. He said: 'All I can remember is a flash of blue, then the pain of someone biting my nose, I can just remember the excruciating pain. I was delirious, in shock and in pain'. He then went back to the hotel he works in and a friend called an ambulance. When Christopher got to hospital medics told him a piece of his nose, the size of a five pence piece was missing. The hotel maintenance worker has since undergone painful skin grafts, and in December surgeons took skin from another part of his face to rebuild his nose. Last month Christopher went under the knife again for more reconstructive surgery. And he will return to hospital this month to find out what the next stage of his treatment will be. Christopher still believes part of his nose was bitten off. But police say there was not enough evidence to suggest a crime had taken place. 'There is no way I could have got that injury without someone else doing it. The police say I could have tripped or fallen, but I have no other bruises on my knees or hands. And I was wearing my glasses and they didn't break. 'The police have now written it off because I can't remember what happened. I thought it happened outside Fenwick but I can't be sure. They say they checked the CCTV cameras in that area and found nothing. But it could have happened somewhere else.' Mystery: Mr Watson has had surgery twice already after the incident on December 23 - but his memory of the night is hazy, making it hard for police to discover what happened . Northumbria Police has confirmed the incident was investigated but no evidence of an attack could be found. A spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm we received a report from the ambulance service that a man had suffered an injury. Extensive enquiries were carried out but no details of what happened or where could be clarified by the man or the person with him. If any further information is available we would ask people to contact the police.'","Christopher Watson, 32,  left with nose injury after work Christmas party .

"The firm behind a mock documentary shown on the BBC last night about the ‘disaster’ of a world without the European Union received EU funding, it has emerged. The Great European Disaster Movie, a 75-minute film screened on BBC4, presented an apocalyptic vision of what would happen if the EU broke apart and warned that it would have ‘catastrophic consequences for all of us’. It imagined an army of Islamic State terrorists advancing on Vienna, Spain cutting off all routes to Gibraltar and the Prime Minister of ‘Great England’ – Nigel Farage –sending all immigrants home. Scroll down for video . Apocalyptic vision: Angus Deayton in the The Great European Disaster Movie on BBC4 . It also imagined that the far-Right leader Marine Le Pen was the president of France and had declared a state of emergency. But last night it emerged that the production company that made it had received EU funding to translate the film and dub it into different languages, so it can be shown in various member states. Eurosceptic MPs accused the BBC of showing ‘EU propaganda’. Brian Binley, a Tory backbencher, said: ‘I think it’s disgraceful. Here is the EU Commission propagating itself throughout Europe. That is simply unacceptable. It is not a governing institution’s job to use taxpayers’ money to perpetuate itself. It is not the job of the commissioners who run the EU budget to perpetrate their vision.’ The 75-minute film presented an apocalyptic vision of what would happen if the EU (pictured at the EU leaders at the 2014 Wales Nato Summit_ were to fall apart . The film, presented by journalist Bill Emmott, starred comedian Angus Deayton as an archaeologist explaining the single currency to a young girl on an aeroplane heading for Berlin, after the collapse of the EU and the abolition of the euro. Mr Deayton laid out – with ‘flashbacks’ to 2014 – the reasons for the EU break-up. The film’s production company, Springshot Productions, said it was depicting ‘a Europe that is sleepwalking towards disaster’, and claimed the film showed that the EU was ‘well worth saving’. It created ‘a unique, choral portrait of the European dream and how it could be lost forever’. Director Annalisa Piras, an Italian journalist, said it would be shown on a ‘Europe-wide tour’ of universities. But Ukip MP Mark Reckless, who appeared in a panel discussion with Mr Emmott after last night’s programme, said he had confirmed EU funding was used to make the film. Mr Reckless said: ‘I asked him if he had received any EU money for it when we appeared on the panel together, and he said they had – for translation into different languages. Political monopoly: The film imagined an army of Islamic State terrorists advancing on Vienna, Spain cutting off all routes to Gibraltar and the Prime Minister of ‘Great England’ – Nigel Farage –sending all immigrants home . ‘I thought he might be a bit sheepish but he admitted it to me quite openly. I think he also put in some of his own money and they had other sources of funding for other elements of the film.’ Last night on Twitter, Mr Emmott said the production company had received ‘EU top-up for language versions’. He said the BBC itself had not received any money from the EU for this programme. However, it has previously been reported that the BBC has received some £22million over a seven-year period from the EU’s communications budget. A BBC spokesman said: ‘No EU money was used in the making of the programme being aired on the BBC. Impartiality is of paramount importance for the BBC. This fictional programme reflects the author’s vision.’","The Great European Disaster Movie showed a vision of future if EU ended .

"A labourer has been banned from keeping or handling fish after being filmed swallowing a goldfish and washing it down with a can of Strongbow. Luke Berry posted a video of himself on social media attempting to down the creature three times after a day of heavy drinking. The 26-year-old from Farringdon, Oxon, was reported to police after RSPCA investigators found the clip online. He was branded 'uncivilised and disgusting' in front of magistrates in Oxford and banned from keeping or handling fish in future. Scroll down for video . Luke Berry was banned from keeping or handling fish after a video of him downing a goldfish with a can of Strongbow was reported to police . In the video titled 'Here fishy fishy', the 26-year-old coughs the creature up three times before swallowing it whole . During the video, Berry coughs up the squirming fish three times before swallowing it whole. Dressed in an Arsenal football shirt and clutching a can of Strongbow cider, he is seen downing the fish before showing his empty mouth to the camera. The clip, titled Here Fishy Fishy, was reported to police following an RSPCA investigation. Prosecutor Paddy Roche said: 'This case arises as a consequence of the RSPCA getting wind of a video that had been posted on Facebook. The labourer's lawyer said he was 'ashamed' of his behaviour and had been encouraged by friends. 'He was extremely intoxicated at the time. He was egged on. He fully accepts what has happened,' said Alice Dodds. She added the 26-year-old, who receives £70 a week in benefits, had overcome a background of 'heavy drinking' before filming the video. Berry was ordered to pay a £500 fine after being described by magistrates as 'disgusting'. Presiding magistrate Iain McCoubrey said Berry could be punished with a 12 month community order with 120 hours of unpaid work. The labourer looked jubilant after being let off with a fine and banning order preventing him from owning fish for five years . 'We are sentencing you for an act of animal cruelty. 'It was a particularly disgusting thing to do, in particular filming it and posting it on Facebook was uncivilised. It was unacceptable. 'This offence of animal cruelty is serious enough for us to make a community order. You will have to comply with an order to carry out unpaid work.' He was banned for keeping or handling fish for five years. Speaking after the sentencing, the RSPCA's Inspector Andy Eddy said: 'We are very satisfied with the sentence. 'It demonstrates that it is unacceptable to behave in this way, to cruelly treat an animal in this fashion, and then post it online for entertainment.'","Luke Berry was filmed downing the goldfish in clip posted on social media .

"Rating: . The pub-with-rooms phenomena continues apace in London - and this is a classic of the genre, executed with style and panache by a couple of twentysomethings who met at Leeds University. This is their third Artist Residence (Brighton and Penzance are up and running), in what used to be a traditional boozer in Pimlico, a short walk from Victoria Station. If the bones of a building are important, here they're as good as they get. A bright splash of colour on the canvas: Artist Residence has brought a dash of flair to an old pub . Built by Thomas Cubitt in 1852, the grand, stuccoed house is on four floors - five if you count the basement, where there's a dimly lit bar and sitting room for hotel guests. I feel good the moment I walk in. There is no fuss at reception and, unlike The Orange nearby, there is a separate entrance for those staying the night, so you don't have to shout your name at the bar or get handed a packet of crisps rather than your room key. I've booked a Small Plus room, but am upgraded to The Loft because not many of the ten rooms are occupied. Everything about The Loft is charming: the wooden floors and panelled walls, bare brick, white paint. The bedhead is a gate and the lights (all on dimmers) are industrial, with Sixties anglepoise lamps on the bedside tables. The cupboard must have been reclaimed from an office. In fact, reclamation seems to be a theme. 'The countryside comes to town' is another. The bathroom is part of the bedroom, with a separate shower and enclosed loo. Two sturdy sash windows look terrific and, hallelujah, you can open them. The restaurant is called 64 Degrees. The idea is that the chefs are part of the eating experience, especially if you sit at the bar, as I do. Small plates of this and that are the order of the day under three sections: veg, fish and meat, with four options for each. Haddock gyoza, pear and fennel has me leaning over the bar and asking one of the chefs for an explanation. There are no side dishes of any description - and no carbs as far as I can see. Dr Atkins would feel at home. There's a bubbly, unpretentious atmosphere, though I would expect proper napkins rather than paper jobbies at these prices. Frankly, that's about the only criticism I can muster. Artist Residence . 52 Cambridge Street . London . SW1V 4QQ . 020 7931 8946 . www.artistresidencelondon.co.uk . Doubles from £150, room only.

"A body found in a car recovered from a Florida river has been confirmed as that of missing teacher Lisa Hayden-Gordon, 51 . Police have confirmed that a body found inside a car recovered from a Florida river is that of a missing piano teacher. Lisa Hayden-Gordon, 51, vanished on January 24 following a night out watching a concert with friends. Her body was recovered from a vehicle found submerged in the New River near Cooley's Landing Marina in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. It was a distinctive blue 2003 Hyundai Elantra that was decorated with stickers of the sun, moon and stars on its hood. Hayden-Gordon had gone out with a man she met online and several of her friends, and they attended a Keller Williams show at Revolution Live in Fort Lauderdale. The group  wanted to take her home because they thought she had had too much to drink, but she went to the restroom at a bar, the Poorhouse, and never returned. They looked for her but when they could not find her anywhere, they ended up leaving. A friend told CBS that people had seen Hayden  walking away from a bar with her keys in her hand the night she went missing. 'Everybody who saw her that night said that she was so happy and having just a good time,' her sister Tara Cloe previously told the Sun Sentinel. 'She's always singing, she was probably singing the whole time during the concert. And then she left.' Discovery: The distinctive blue 2003 Hyundai Elantra, pictured, was found near a Fort Lauderdale marina on Friday morning - more than a month after Hayden-Gordon vanished during a night out with friends . Missed: Hayden-Gordon was known as 'Noodle' to her friends and students. Witnesses said they saw her walking away from a concert with her car keys . Friends had made tearful pleas for information about the woman they called 'Noodles', a nickname that stuck after she became addicted to the food while in hospital recovering from a car accident as a child. 'My sister would never leave us. And she's the most loving, outgoing, friendly person,' Susan O'Leary told the Sun Sentinel earlier. 'For her not to be here, be a part of our lives, I don't even know how to tell you what kinds of emotions you could have. We don't know what to do, where else to go, where else to turn.' Police said they are still investigating the cause of Ms Hayden-Gordon's death, according to Local10.com.","Body found inside  vehicle that of 51-year-old Lisa Hayden-Gordon .

"We saw Victoria Beckham's minimalism in New York, Burberry's beautiful boho in London and now the Italian designers are serving up some seasonal style of their own on the runways of Milan. Armani and DSquared2 showcased their AW15 offerings on  Monday and whilst Kendall Jenner was too ill to walk in any shows, there was still plenty to talk about. They had a big act to follow after Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana - the head honchos at Dolce & Gabbana kicked the week off with style when they unveiled their collection, Viva la Mamma, in all its glory yesterday. Giorgio Armani unveiled the 'skouser' (right) - a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material, bold dresses, left, and fringed shawls worn around the waist (left) Is it a soft furnishing or an evening gown? Armani seemed influenced by interiors with this dress . Giorgio Armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating what Vogue are dubbing the 'skouser' - a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material, which were paired with fur jackets and blouses. Elsewhere on the catwalk were the classic tuxedos that Armani does so well, as well as sequin jackets and even more fringed ponchos. He also showcased strapless dresses with ruched bust lines that looked eerily like curtain pelmets or bed skirts. Yet as he celebrates 40 years of his brand this year, Armani proved he's still a byword for mature elegance. Italian heavy hitter Giorgio Armani wore his signature all-black on the catwalk after this AW15 show . But elsewhere, the shows proved that in Milan - more is more. We saw boho vibes on the Burberry catwalk in London. Similarly, Matthew Williamson stuck to his signature boho style by unveiling a mystical and bright hued collection inspired by the signs of the Zodiac. Following suit, DSquared2 sent models out in flouncy, Inuit-like designs teamed with fur-lined boots, capes and ponchos. The tribal prints, which came in every colourway, completely clashed - but with aplomb. Canadian fashion designers and twin brothers, Dean and Dan Caten, who head up DSquared2, called on catwalk stalwarts Malaika Firth and Lily Donaldson to showcase their elaborate multi-layered AW15 designs in the Italian city today. The pair appeared to draw on their country's Inuit roots with parkas with huge fur-lined hoods, thong ties and bold tribal prints. These Native American-influenced pieces were teamed with European colonial-era clothes such as culottes with admiral's gold detailing at the hems. DSquared2 sent models out in flouncy, Inuit-like designs teamed with fur-lined boots, capes and ponchos . Brit favourite Lily Donaldson walked in the DSquared2 show in Milan on Monday . Models also wore nude body stockings printed with native patterns to evoke body paint or tribal tattoos. But hair and make-up were kept simple with bronzed glowing skin and loose hair. British beauty Lily Donaldson wore a mixture of styles including gold-embossed navy admiral's trousers, Native American feather trim, beaded bag and sandals and a trapper-style fur decoration. Slung over all of that was an enormous ruby and diamond necklace and opulent sapphire and diamond drop earrings. Other looks included Native American blankets worn with cropped jackets and huge necklaces or voluminous white dresses teamed with a masculine admiral's jacket. Canadian fashion designers and twin brothers, Dean and Dan Caten, head up DSquared2 and rocked the runway with a tribal-inspired collection . Dolce & Gabbana's show, Viva la Mamma, invited models to walk the runway with their children in Milan . While yesterday Dolce & Gabbana created a memorable show aimed at celebrating motherhood. The flamboyant duo - who are known for drawing on long-held ideas and imagery of Italian womanhood, whether it's the sensual town vamp or a black-clad nonna - sent models on to the catwalk with children as accessories, walking to the beat of Spice Girl's Nineties hit, Mama. There were toddlers and babies all dressed in the Italian house's sumptuous silks and luxurious lace. Called the Viva La Mamma show, other motifs running through the collection were the deep red, almost Gothic, roses (traditionally given on Mother's Day in Italy), vintage brooches, midi dresses, black lace and corsetry. Aimed at celebrating motherhood, models took to the catwalk armed with their own children as accessories . Dresses were dedicated to the mother and came with hand-stitched red roses . The curtains opened to the sight of mothers and their children and the sounds of Spice Girl's iconic hit, Mama . Famous face Karlie Kloss walks the runway at the Dolce & Gabbana show . The slogans 'Amore' and 'Mama' were embroidered or appliqued and some dresses were emblazoned with prints of Madonna and child, others were decorated with childlike Crayola drawings. Models wore their hair back but parted in the centre, in the style of chic 1940s Italian women, and their lips matched the crimson rose embroidery. However, Salvatore Ferragamo's collection had a more restrained Sixties feel with a brown, beige and maroon palette and graphic prints on the catwalk - as well as the dresses. Dresses, skirts and knits were covered in vertical  panels and the geometry theme carried through to most of the looks. Fluid silk dresses were constructed from different coloured tessellated panels, other tunics and skirts were high-necked and severe. Where Dolce & Gabbana was over-the-top and elaborate, Ferragamo was pared-down and minimalist, helping to set the stage for the final day in Italy tomorrow before the focus shifts to Paris Fashion Week.

"A mother has claimed her toddler discovered a nine-inch meat cleaver stuffed into the side of a bed in the family's hotel room. Pregnant Donna Lever, her boyfriend David Johnson and their four children, aged between seven months and seven, were sent to stay at the Hill View Hotel in Blackburn, Lancashire, after a fire  devastated their home. But when the family went to move a single bed in the hotel room, they say their two-year-old son Charles found the blade and a number of tin cans had been pushed inside a rip in the side of the piece of furniture. Donna Lever and David Johnson, pictured with children Eva, seven months, Dominic, one, and Charles, two, say toddler Charles discovered a nine-inch meat cleaver stuffed into the side of a bed in their hotel room . The family say they reported their find to a member of hotel staff, and to Rossendale Council, which had placed them in the hotel. But the hotel manager, EJ Hussain, refutes the claims - and has accused the family of damaging a bed, which they deny. Miss Lever, 38, and her family were moved into the temporary accommodation after the fire, thought to have been sparked by a faulty tumble dryer, tore through their  housing association property in Bacup. The family said they had been out when the fire started on Wednesday last week, and because their home was so badly damaged they were told by Rossendale Council that they must go into temporary accommodation at the hotel. The family say Charles discovered this meat cleaver inside a rip in the side of the bed when the family attempted to move the piece of furniture . Miss Lever and Mr Johnson, 32, who are both jobless, and the children - Mylo, seven, Charles, two, Dominic, one, and Eva, seven months - had been due to stay at the hotel for two nights, but say they left after just one having discovered the cleaver, and returned home. 'I couldn’t believe it,' said Miss Lever, who is 18 weeks pregnant. 'From the outside, the hotel looked presentable but the accommodation clearly hadn’t been cleaned before we arrived. 'There was a rip to the bed and a load of tin cans stuffed inside. It was bad but I never expected to find a meat cleaver. It’s a weapon. 'We were moving a single bed against a wall so the kids, who were topping and tailing, wouldn’t fall out in their sleep, and they spotted it. 'I was disgusted. We were meant to stay for two nights but we told them the next morning we were leaving. On the way out, I told a lady working there about the the cleaver. 'Now we’re back in the smoke-damaged house, despite the fact the fire service told us it wasn’t safe for me to be there while I’m pregnant. EJ Hussain, manager of the Hill View Hotel in Blackburn (pictured), refutes the claims - and has accused the family of damaging a bed, which they deny . Mr Johnson, who took a photograph of the cleaver on his mobile phone, said he believes it was left by a previous guest. Speaking of the moment his son found the knife he said: 'He had his hand underneath the bed and he pulled something shiny out. 'I picked it up and realised it was a massive meat cleaver. 'I was absolutely horrified. If I hadn't have seen him with it he could have done himself some serious harm.' The couple and their children are now sleeping on the kitchen and living room floors of their damaged house. Rossendale Council has confirmed it had received the complaint following the family’s stay. But Mr Hussain says the room had been 'inspected thoroughly' before the family arrived and no concerns were reported to him during their time at the hotel. He later contacted the police to claim a bed had been damaged by the family, and has also accused them of littering the room with cans - which, like the criminal damage allegation, they strongly deny. 'We're a family, we don't go into a hotel and drink beer in front of our kids,' said Mr Johnson. 'I like a beer but not in front of my children. We can't even afford to drink now that our house has been damaged. Miss Lever, 38, and her family were moved into the temporary accommodation after the fire, thought to have been sparked by a faulty tumble dryer, tore through their rented house in Bacup . 'I find it insulting as all I'm trying to do is put a roof over my kids' heads.' Mr Hussain also refutes the family's claim that the room was untidy and said the cleaver was not spotted during his staff’s prior checks. 'I have had a word with my cleaners and they say no one complained that day,' Mr Hussain said. 'I find it quite upsetting and alarming that they would make these claims. 'I have helped out vulnerable people for Rossendale Council many times. I am shocked that they would complain. I spent £90,000 on a refurbishment recently. I do not know anything about a cleaver or knife. It was not there when my staff looked.' Lancashire police said it received a report of criminal damage at the hotel on Friday afternoon, and that officers had arranged to visit the premises. A Rossendale Council spokesman said: 'The council’s supported accommodation providers were full on the day that the emergency occurred and our Housing Options Team were looking for accommodation for this family. 'Rossendale Council has been using this particular accommodation provider for over six years now and has never previously had a formal complaint about its condition or standards. 'The council was only made aware of the meat cleaver find once the family had left the accommodation, after one night and returned to their home. Our Housing Options Team are looking into this matter as the safety and comfort of tenants who are unfortunate to have to be placed in emergency accommodation are of paramount importance.' Registered social landlord, Green Vale Homes, said contractors were working to repair damage to floors, ceilings and walls to the couple’s home.","Donna Lever and her family sent to hotel after fire at their Blackburn home .

"Teenagers as young as 16 in Birmingham have undergone weight loss surgery (file picture) Obese teenagers as young as 16 have had NHS-funded gastric band operations, worrying new figures show. And in a four-year period, the number of people aged under 30 receiving weight loss surgery in Birmingham more than doubled. Gastric band and gastric bypass operations are only carried out on the NHS when a patient's life is deemed to be at risk. Such surgery is a last resort, and before it is considered a patient is asked to make drastic changes to their lifestyle to try and lose weight naturally. The guidelines are such that a 5ft 5ins child will not be considered eligible for the drastic procedure unless they weigh at least 15 stone. Meanwhile someone who is 5ft 8ins would need to weigh almost 17 stone before they can be given the go-ahead for surgery. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre released under the Freedom of Information Act show in the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery. These included two 16 year olds, two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds. Overall between 2008-09 and 2011-12 the numbers of the radical operations performed on the under 30s rose from 35 to 71 - a 102 per cent increase. It comes as new figures this weekend revealed hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year. Since 2011, 1,403 newborns have been classified as obese - weighing 9lb 15oz or more, a Freedom of Information request revealed. Last year it emerged that West Midlanders are the second fattest group in the whole country, with NHS England figures revealing 65.7 per cent of people are overweight or obese. New figures released in January this year highlighted the worrying news that almost four out of 10 children in Birmingham are  officially classed as overweight or obese by the age of 11. Concerns have been raised that people are opting for stomach surgery as an 'easy option' rather than go to the trouble of changing their lifestyle, eating more healthily and taking exercise. NHS guidelines state that surgery can only be offered when the patient has 'life threatening obesity' - a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above, or a BMI of 35 with other serious health conditions that could be improved through weight loss, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure. The policy states: 'It is always recommended that patients try to lose weight through a healthy, calorie-controlled diet and increased exercise before you consider weight loss surgery, as surgery carries a risk of complications and requires a significant change in lifestyle afterwards. 'Due to these associated risks, most surgeons, whether they are working privately or for the NHS, would only consider a person for surgery if there was a clinical need, and not just for cosmetic reasons.' People can also opt to pay for weight loss surgery privately. A gastric band operation, which reduces the size of the stomach, costs up to £8,000. Meanwhile, a full gastric bypass, which re-routes the digestive system meaning a person can digest much less food, costs around £15,000. In the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery. which includes gastric bands abd bypasses. These included two 16 year olds, two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds . The NHS has warned that the treatment is available more cheaply overseas, but added it carries increased risks. Current statistics suggest that there is a one in 1,000 risk of death from weight loss surgery within 30 days. Nationally 16 teenagers under the age of 17 underwent stomach surgery in the last five years. Responding to figures revealing a rise in obese newborns, Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said that although some mothers suffer from medical conditions, which increase the size of the baby, most just overeat. He said: 'Quite simply, the number of pregnant women who are obese at the start is increasing. 'It is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight. 'As they have the same kind of nutrition as their parents there is a continuous upwards spiral. 'Successive governments have not really addressed the obesity problem. It starts at conception and sometimes even before then.' Mr Fry also suggested that the number of women having caesareans was increasing due to the increasing size of their babies. He said: 'Some babies are so fat they cannot come out naturally. 'Women have to understand that they have to keep themselves in shape due to the huge responsibility they have of producing the next generation. 'If we get it wrong, it's a vicious circle and it will just go on and on and on.' MailOnline has contacted NHS Midlands and East for comment. A 12-year-old boy has become the youngest person in Britain to have a gastric band fitted, as doctors struggle to fight the child obesity epidemic. The schoolboy is one of an increasing number of youngsters who have had the controversial weight-loss operations, despite recommendations that such high-risk surgery should be a last resort when other efforts to slim down have failed. Figures seen by The Mail on Sunday show that 62 young people aged 18 or under had the stomach-shrinking surgery at NHS and private hospitals over a three-year period. They include the 12-year-old, one boy aged 13 and two boys aged 15. Professor Monty Duggal, head of paediatric dentistry at Leeds Dental Institute, who regularly operates on obese children to remove decayed teeth, said it was ‘a matter of national shame that we have these health problems when we are a wealthy, developed nation. The treatments I carry out all cost taxpayers money. ‘[Yet] as a professional in my field I have to approach parents with great caution. I can’t accuse parents of anything. But of course the parent is responsible for the child’s welfare and health.’ A 12-year-old boy has become the youngest person in Britain to have a gastric band fitted as figures show 62 young people aged 18 or under had the stomach-shrinking surgery at NHS and private hospitals over a three-year period . He added that social workers would be quick to step in at any sign of a parent abusing a child, ‘yet you can have a child with up to 20 decayed teeth in their mouth, a big fat face, seriously ill and having to be admitted to hospital for a serious operation under general anaesthetic without consequence for the parent.’ Official statistics from the National Bariatric Surgery Register, which is compiled from surgeons’ reports, reveal that the 12-year-old boy is the youngest child to have been fitted with a gastric band within this group, although it is not recorded if the operation was publicly or privately funded. NHS statisticians said the youngest patient they had on record for bariatric surgery paid for by the Health Service was 13. However, many surgeons argue that the stomach bands could save the NHS money through reducing levels of obesity and associated illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, which are estimated to cost the Health Service £5 billion a year. Dr Lucy Stirling, a clinical psychologist at King’s College Hospital, said parents whose children are facing gastric band surgery can fail to take responsibility for their child’s weight issues. She said: ‘Parents can be in denial of the part they have played. ‘But children need to be brought up to eat in such a way that they’re nurturing their body rather than slowly damaging it.’ Paediatric consultant Ashish Desai added: ‘Some parents, when they come to us, have the idea that if their child has the surgery it will act like a magic wand.’","Obese teenagers in Birmingham given drastic weight loss surgery .

"Mayor Bill de Blasio attended a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-friendly St. Patrick's Day parade on Sunday, and told participants that a society for all is one that embraces and respects everyone. The St. Pat's for All parade stepped off in Queens under a heavy snowfall. It was held as an alternative to the city's centuries-old St. Patrick's Day Parade in Manhattan, which for years has excluded gay groups and this year is scheduled for March 17. De Blasio, a Democrat, refused to march in last year's Manhattan parade because it wasn't fully inclusive, and Guinness beer dropped its sponsorship. Organizers said last year, though, that they would welcome one gay contingent under its own banner this year. On Sunday, de Blasio said he is 'not ready to commit to marching' in this year's Manhattan event. Parade: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, center, waves the flag of Ireland as he marches beside Kerry Kennedy, third from left, during the all-inclusive St. Pat's For All parade in Sunnyside, Queens on Sunday . Celebration: Marchers carry a banner reading 'St. Pat's for All' on Sunday in the snowy weather . Capital New York reported that NBC Universal employees are planning to march with a banner for Out@NBCUniversal. The group's Twitter page describes itself as 'the employee resource group of LGBT & Straight Ally employees at NBCUniversal.' De Blasio arrived about 15 minutes late to the St. Pats for All parade, sporting a lavender shirt and green tie. Despite the snow and cold he said, 'It's a sunny day in my world.' 'You are a hardy troupe,' he told people gathered for the parade. 'You are here to celebrate no matter what. That is what pride is all about - pride in the fact that in New York City you can be whoever you are.' The mayor said on Sunday: 'A society for everyone is a society where everyone is respected, where everyone is embraced, where everyone has a say at the table.' In the past, gays were free to march in the world's biggest and oldest St. Patrick's Day Parade but not with banners saying they're LGBT. Most marching units in the parade carry identifying banners. There are about 320 units in this year's parade, the parade committee said. The New York Daily News quoted the mayor as saying of the March 17 event 'I'm not ready to commit to marching, because all we've heard is that one delegation related to NBC will be allowed to have members of the LGBT community in it.' Gathering: de Blasio looks on during the snowstorm at the St. Pat's For All parade. The parade, which embraces diversity, is considered an alternative to New York City's official St. Patrick's Day parade . Per Capital New York, de Blasio said 'Having only one delegation associated with one company that allows members of the LGBT community is obviously a pretty narrow concession, and I think we'd like to see something that's more inclusive. 'Here is an example of a parade that's inclusive of all - it celebrates Irish heritage in a way that everyone can be a part of. I hope for some more progress with the parade in Manhattan, but there is still time, and we look forward to some additional discussion and I certainly welcome any discussions with anybody who wants to make it more inclusive.' 'Even though it is a statement of some progress that this NBC delegation has been included, and I certainly commend that, we need something more for it to really feel like we've turned a corner here,' de Blasio reportedly said, per Capital. LGBT activists say the main parade organizer, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, has been under increasing pressure to allow diversity, especially after New York state passed its Marriage Equality Act in 2011, allowing marriages for same-sex couples. The two grand marshals at the 15th annual St. Pat's for All parade were longtime human rights activist Kerry Kennedy and Tony Award-winning actor Brian O'Byrne. Patti Lowenhaupt, a retired art teacher and Queens resident who showed up for the parade, said people 'are all human beings underneath it all.' 'We here in Queens have the ability to accept all kinds of people,' Lowenhaupt said. Several protesters, however, stood on the side holding signs that read 'Sodom & Gomorrah.' Other elected officials participating in the St. Pat's for All parade included City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and city Comptroller Scott Stringer.

"A high school wrestler claimed an Oregon state title on Saturday night as his grandfather suffered a fatal heart attack in the stands. Dallas High School senior Matt Hofenbredl was halfway through the third round of his winning match at the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum in Portland when his grandfather, Larry Hofenbredl, collapsed. Unaware of the situation, Matt defeated his opponent and jumped into his coach's arms before his mother walked on to the mat and told him what had happened, the Statesman-Journal reported. He then ran to stands where Assistant Coach Josh Christenson, who also works as a firefighter, was performing CPR on the 70-year-old, The Oregonian reported. Tragedy: Matt Hofenbredl, pictured left at a previous competition, won a wrestling state title on Saturday night as his grandfather, Larry Hofenbredl, suffered a fatal heart attack while watching him from the stands . 'He managed to get a pulse back briefly, but Grandpa Hofenbredl didn't make it,' Head Coach Tony coach told the newspaper. The tournament stopped for around 10 minutes as medics rushed to Mr Hofenbredl's side and took him to hospital, where he passed away. Matt Hofenbredl and his teammates left before the final match and did not attend the awards presentation, the Statesman-Journal reported. The team wrote on Facebook on Saturday night: 'Matt Hofenbredl has won his 3rd state championship. Grandpa Hofenbredl simultaneously had a medical emergency during the match and has left by ambulance. Your prayers and good wishes are requested.' Together: Matt, pictured as a child with his grandfather, won the match without knowing what had happened to his grandfather. After he won, his mother ran on to the mat and he headed to his grandfather's side . Winner: Hofenbredl, pictured right in an earlier match, won his third Oregon state title on Saturday night . Support: The teenager expressed his thanks on his Twitter page after the incident on Saturday night . The teenager later tweeted: 'Thanks to everyone that has been here for me in the last hour, it sure has been rough thank to everyone.' Another grandchild, Kylie Hofenbredl, shared a photograph of their beloved grandfather to Facebook, writing: 'I love you Grandpa. I'm so thankful you raised my Dad to be just like you. You're both the strongest most hard working men I know. It's hard to think of how it will be without you.' The wrestling team also posted about the incident on its Facebook page on Sunday. 'The high of Matt's win, the tragedy of the loss -- it's hard to explain the moment,' the message said. 'Your prayers and good wishes are requested.'

'If, in fact, Iran is willing to agree to double-digit years . of keeping their program where it is right now and, in fact, . rolling back elements of it that currently exist ... if we've . got that, and we've got a way of verifying that, there's no . other steps we can take that would give us such assurance that . they don't have a nuclear weapon,' he said.

"A four-year-old boy has shot himself dead after finding a gun at his babysitter's home. Codrick Beal had been staying overnight at a friend of his mother's in north Harris County, Texas when he fatally shot himself just before noon on Sunday. He had been visiting the home while his mother, Ashley Beal, celebrated her birthday. His father, Codrick McCall, was also not at the scene of the shooting. It is still unclear how the boy came across the firearm and authorities continue to investigate. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Four-year-old Codrick Beal, pictured, shot himself dead after finding a gun while staying with a family friend in Houston, Texas over the weekend. His mother had been celebrating her birthday at the time . Loss: Codrick's mother and father (pictured with the boy, left) were not at the home at the time of the shooting . After the boy was found, relatives and friends were seen comforting each other outside the house in the 19000 block of Imperial Stone. 'My baby is gone!' the boy's mother Ashley cried outside the home as authorities swept the property. Codrick, her only child, was reportedly staying with a long-time friend of his mother's. The babysitter had to be collected by EMS, having sobbed so hard that she collapsed on the road outside the house in convulsions. 'It's just a terrible accident,' Ashley's cousin, Leticia Beal told the Houston Chronicle.  'We see it all the time on the news but you never think it'll hit home. It's the most horrible thing.' The boy's paternal grandmother also wept as she paid tribute to youngster on Sunday. Distraught: Family and friends weep outside the Houston home where a four-year-old boy shot himself .

'You can't bring death back. What has happened has happened. All we can do is try to pick up the pieces and continue with life there is nothing else to do.' She did not shed anymore light on the death but said she thinks her grandson should still be here. 'They sell you safety locks with your firearm when you purchase it,' she said. Authorities from the Harris County Sheriff's Office investigated the scene but have not disclosed the kind of gun was fired or who the owned it. Deputies said no charges have yet been brought and a Harris County grand jury would decide if any one should be charged in the death. Sadness: Codrick's paternal grandmother, Sharron McCall, said she had no idea how the accident happened because guns should have safety locks. Through tears, she said her grandson had so much to live for . Loved: Four-year-old Codrick, pictured with his grandmother, was his mother's only child . 'He was a loveable baby,' said Keith Beal, Ashley's uncle. 'Very funny, he loved to play around all the time. He just had so much life in him, he was always a happy baby.' A spokeswoman for Harris County Child Protective Services said they are also investigating. KTRK reported that CPS has previously responded to calls regarding the boy's parents but had never been sent to the home where the boy died.

"Iraqi warplanes and artillery began pounding Tikrit this morning as 30,000 troops and irregulars prepared to attack the city, a stronghold of the Islamic State insurgency. The operation in the birthplace of former dictator Saddam Hussein was announced last night by Iraq's prime minister, who urged soldiers and government-backed Shiite militias to spare civilians. Speaking from Samarra, the other main city in Salaheddin province, Haider al-Abadi appeared to be addressing fears of reprisals against the Tikrit area's mainly Sunni population. Scroll down for video . Attack: Volunteer Shiite fighters, who are supporting the Iraqi government forces in the fight against the Islamic State group fire a howitzer artillery canon in the village of Awaynat near the city of Tikrit . Irregulars: Iraqi security forces and Shi'ite fighters chant slogans as they gather at Udhaim dam, north of Baghdad, ahead of an advance on Islamic State positions Tikrit that is expected to begin today . Feeding the soul: Soldiers and irregulars take a moment to pray as Iraq masses its forces outside the city, which was the birthplace of Saddam Hussein and an important step on the road to the IS-held city of Mosul . Feeding the body: Fighters scoff their rations ahead of the attack. It is feared the mainly Shiite forces of the Iraqi government could attack the area's mainly Sunni population, worsening sectarian divisions . On social media, Mr Abadi called 'for utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property' in the city, which was last year the scene of a brutal massacre of hundreds of mainly Shiite Iraqi army recruits. Government forces have been working their way north in recent months, notching up key victories against IS. But Tikrit, which has resisted them several times, is their toughest target yet. 'Security forces are advancing on three main fronts towards Tikrit, Ad-Dawr (to the south) and Al-Alam (to the north),' a senior army officer on the ground told AFP by telephone. The army officer said the forces involved in the battle were from the army, police, counter-terrorism units, a government-controlled volunteer group known as the Popular Mobilisation units and local Sunni tribes opposed to IS. 'The attack is being carried out using fighter jets, helicopters and artillery targeting Tikrit to secure the advance and cut supply routes,' he said. Military sources said Iraqi warplanes were involved but it was not immediately clear whether foreign air support - Iranian or from the US-led coalition fighting IS - was also called in. According to both Iraqi and Iranian media, Qassem Suleimani - supremo of the elite Iranian Quds force, specialising in 'subversive warfare' - was in Salaheddin province to help coordinate operations. Massing: Iraqi Army and volunteer fighters prepare at Sedull Udeyim region before moving into Tikrit . Good morale: Iraqi forces have notched up key victories against IS as they've inched north in recent weeks . Religion: A soldier walks past a line of armoured cars, one of which has a photo of a cleric in the window . Cavalry: Iraqi armoured personnel carriers are lined up ahead of the attack on Tikrit today . Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State, but the attack by thousands of Shiite irregulars could severely test the government's ability to handle sectarian divisions. Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam Hussein, despite his regime's nominal secularism, and the Shiite majority. Since the Islamic State insurgency began, the Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shiite militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq. 'The priority we gave to the armed forces and all the forces taking part alongside them is to preserve the security of citizens,' Mr Abadi said last night. Hadi al-Ameri, the Popular Mobilisation commander, appealed to Tikrit residents on Saturday to leave their homes within 48 hours so government forces could 'wrap up the battle of the revenge for Speicher.' Speicher is a military base near Tikrit from which hundreds of new, mostly Shiite, recruits were kidnapped before being executed last summer, as the Islamic State insurgency took control of much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland. Shiite militias in particular have vowed to avenge the Speicher executions, sparking fears of mass killings against Sunnis if Tikrit were to be recaptured. Mr Abadi appealed to residents to turn against the jihadists, who have suffered a string of military losses since a U.S.-led coalition of Western and Arab nations stepped up their support for Iraq's embattled government. 'I call on all those who were misled and made mistakes in the past to lay down their arms today. This may be the last chance,' Mr Abadi said, suggesting some could be granted amnesty. Iraqi forces tried and failed several times to wrest back Tikrit, a Sunni Arab city on the Tigris river around 100 miles north of Baghdad. Ready: A wide view shows Iraqi soldiers and Shiite irregulars massing at the Udhaim dam. Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State . Taking a moment: An Iraqi soldier rests on a wall at the Udhaim dam. An army officer said the forces involved in the battle were from the army, police, counter-terrorism units, volunteer units and local tribes . Armed: Troops wander the streets around Udhaim dam while they wait for the order to attack. The arrival of many thousands of Shiite fighters in the mainly Sunni city of Tikrit risks inflaming sectarian divisions . Last phone call? A soldier chats on his mobile phone as columns of vehicles move past on their way to attack . The military commander for Salaheddin province, Abdel Wahab Saadi, said Tikrit had both symbolic and strategic importance. 'The aim of course is to liberate Salaheddin to allow for the return of displaced families but it is also going to be a stepping stone on the way to liberating Mosul,' he told AFP. Tikrit is the hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein, the remnants of whose Baath party have collaborated with IS in attempting to topple the Shiite-dominated government. IS declared a 'caliphate' last June straddling Iraq and Syria, where the US-led coalition has also been conducting air strikes but not coordinating with any significant ground force.","Artillery and warplanes began pounding Tikrit this morning ahead of attack .

"He is better known as the hapless, doughnut-obsessed safety officer at Springfield nuclear power plant, but it appears that Homer Simpson may have outwitted some of the brightest minds on the planet. The author of a book looking at the maths hidden within episodes of the Simpsons has discovered that Homer may have predicted the mass of the Higgs boson 14 years before physicists discovered the particle at the Large Hadron Collider in Cern. Dr Simon Singh, a physicist and author, found the solution written on a blackboard in front of Homer during a 1998 episode of the long running cartoon. Scroll down for video . The formula written on Homer's blackboard above is said to correctly predict the mass of the Higgs boson . In 'The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace', Homer becomes an inventor in an attempt to follow in the footsteps of Thomas Edison. Speaking to the Independent, Dr Singh said: 'That equation predicts the mass of the Higgs boson. The 'God Particle', also known as the Higgs boson, was a missing piece in the jigsaw for physicists in trying to understand how the universe works. Scientists believe that a fraction of a second after the Big Bang that gave birth to the universe, an invisible energy field, called the Higgs field, formed. This has been described as a kind of 'cosmic treacle' across the universe. As particles passed through it, they picked up mass, giving them size and shape and allowing them to form the atoms that make up you, everything around you and everything in the universe. This was the theory proposed in 1964 by former grammar school boy Professor Higgs that has now been confirmed. Without the Higgs field particles would simply whizz around space in the same way as light does. A boson is a type of sub-atomic particle. Every energy field has a specific particle that governs its interaction with what's around it. To try to pin it down, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva smashed together beams of protons – the 'hearts of atoms' – at close to the speed of light, recreating conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Although they would rapidly decay, they should have left a recognisable footprint. This footprint was found in 2012. 'If you work it out you get the mass of a Higgs boson that's only a bit larger than the nano-mass of a Higgs boson actually is. 'It's kind of amazing as Homer makes this prediction 14 years before it was discovered.' He added: 'One of the equations relates to Fermat's Last Theorem, and my first book was about all about this notorious equations, so leapt out of the screen. 'My PhD is in particle physics, so I was similarly shocked by Homer's equation predicting the mass of the Higgs boson.' The existence of the Higgs boson - sometimes nicknamed the God Particle - was first predicted by Professor Peter Higgs, a theoretical physicist at the University of Edinburgh, and five other physicists in 1964. The elementary particle is required to explain why other fundamental particles in the universe have mass. The theory said that all subatomic particles interact within an energy field known as the Higgs field, giving them mass. Like electromagnetic radiation, which can exist as both an energetic wave and a particle simultaneously, the Higg's field also has a corresponding particle - the Higgs boson. Proof that the particle existed, however, did not appear until March 2013 when scientists working on the Large Hadron Collider - the worlds biggest atom smasher - announced they had discovered a particle that matched predictions of the Higgs boson would be like. In an experiment costing £8.6 billion ($13.25 billion), they were able to prove the existence of a new particle with a mass of 125Gev/c2. The physicists at Cern who worked on the discovery, along with Higgs and his colleagues were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics for their contribution. However, it appears that the writers of the Simpsons had already successfully predicted the outcome 14 years earlier. Dr Singh claims the formula written by Homer while he is attempting to come up with a series of madcap inventions, including an electric hammer and make-up gun, gives close to the same answer. The Simpsons contains many mathematical jokes like the one above from an early episode in the series . This equation above is said to concern the density of the universe but after a minor implosion in his basement Homer adjust the equation in an attempt to adjust the balance and prevent further accidents . Simon Singh has written a book on the maths hidden within the cartoon series The Simpsons . In fact one of the script writers for the episode, David X. Cohen, was responsible for sneaking in the mathematical equations onto the blackboard. He contacted one of his high school friends, David Schiminovich, who is an astronomer at Columbia University. The first equation on the blackboard was largely based on his work predicting the mass of the Higgs boson - denoted by H0. The pair cooked up the equation to give the best answer on the data available at the time. Dr Singh said: 'The equation is a playful combination of various fundamental parameters, namely the Planck constant, the gravitational constant, and the speed of light. 'If you look up these numbers and plug them into the equation, it predicts a mass of 775 giga-electron-volts (GeV), which is not unreasonably higher than the 125 GeV estimate that emerged when the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012. 'Indeed, 775 GeV was not a bad guess bearing in mind that Homer is an amateur inventor and he performed this calculation fourteen years before the physicists at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, tracked down the elusive particle.' It is not the only piece of science hidden within the long running cartoon series. The second line on the blackboard contains an equation that some have claimed is the solution to Fermat's last theorem - although in truth the calculation falls just short. Perhaps typically Homer also appears to have been thinking with his stomach with a formula that suggests eating half a doughnut makes a whole. Or is it just a hole? Elsewhere in the series there are numerous jokes about perfect numbers and mersenne primes and the first ever full episode had a joke about calculus. Dr Singh, who has written a book called The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets, claims that the Simpsons is the most mathematical TV shows on prime time television. This may be because many of the writers of the show were mathematicians themselves. Mr Cohen, who wrote scripts for the Simpsons for five years, was a gifted mathematician from a young age and studied physics at Harvard University. He is known to often smuggle mathematics into the TV series. Dr Singh said he hoped the maths in the cartoon might even help persuade more people to take an interest in the subject. He said: 'The Simpsons has many mathematicians on its writing team, including Al Jean, who worked on the very first series and who pretty much runs the show today. 'He was such a brilliant young mathematician that he went to Harvard University when he was only sixteen years old. 'If a nerdy teenager spots the maths in The Simpsons, I hope that he or she will think that maths is rightly cool. 'The Simpsons is cool, the writers of The Simpsons are cool, and if they like maths then maths must be cool. I think the show gives a big endorsement of nerd culture.'","Author and physicist Dr Simon Singh found a formula for the mass of the Higgs boson written on a blackboard during an episode of The Simpsons .

"David Cameron should drop his pledge to reduce net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ ahead of the election, senior Tories say. The Prime Minister had promised to get the figure below 100,000 – ‘no ifs, no buts’ – four years ago. Last week, however, the number moving to Britain exceeded the number leaving by a record margin of nearly 300,000. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron has been urged to drop his pledge to reduce net migration to 'tens of thousands' ahead of the election by senior Tories . Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . Mr Cameron has conceded defeat on his pledge but he and Home Secretary Theresa May insist they will try to hit the sub-100,000 target if they stay in power. The issue has caused divisions at the top of the Tory Party with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Chancellor George Osborne reportedly expressing their doubts. A friend of Mr Osborne said his ‘instincts are very different’ from Mr Cameron’s. Ken Clarke, who has served as a minister under Mr Cameron, said the entire pledge had been a mistake. ‘We will have to drop the target,’ he told the Times newspaper. ‘It would not be possible to achieve it without damaging our economy quite severely. ‘I’m afraid that the net migration target has proved to be a mistake.’ Baroness Warsi, the former foreign office minister, warned that the failure to meet the target risked undermining the Conservatives’ wider credibility. ‘If you set yourself unrealistic targets you are setting yourself up to fail and, in the long term, turn the whole thing into a bigger issue by fuelling the perception that the Government can’t get a grip,’ she said. Dropping the target will fuel the feeling among Eurosceptic backbenchers that the only way to cut immigration is to leave the European Union. Mr Cameron has acknowledged that the reason immigrants want to come to Britain is because of the recovering economy and strong prospects of work. He has spoken of the need for reform of free movement rules in the EU, but the leaders of other member states, particularly Germany’s Angela Merkel, have made it clear they will not budge on this point. Former minister Ken Clarke has said that the entire migration pledge has been a mistake and not possible to achieve without damaging the country's economy . The latest figures, which put net migration at 298,000 for the year ending in last September, would have exceeded 100,000 even without immigration from within Europe. Polls suggest the public are increasingly concerned about levels of immigration, which has fuelled support for Ukip. The latest YouGov survey suggests 75 per cent of voters think the numbers coming in are too high. A former strategist in Downing Street told the Times that the Prime Minister was exasperated with the dissent over his policy, saying: ‘Why on earth are the only people who are really committed to our policy me and Theresa May?’ Last week Number 10 said Mr Cameron was ‘disappointed’ with the latest figures. Immigration minister James Brokenshire said: ‘Uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on public services and can force down wages. ‘That’s why this Government is working to reduce net migration.’ When Mr Cameron entered Downing Street in May 2010 net migration was running at 244,000. The 298,000 figure has been surpassed only once, in 2005. The majority of EU migrants now come from Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and France, which all have moribund economies and high youth unemployment.","Prime Minster has been urged to drop his pledge to reduce net migration .

Leo Dennis Kozlowski, 68, lives in a small, rented apartment in midtown Manhattan with his third wife, Kimberly, 48, whom he met while he was spending time at Mid-State Correctional Facility in upstate New York. Kozlowski was jailed in 2005 for taking unauthorized bonuses, conspiracy and other charges. He was also ordered to pay $167 million in restitution and fines. Former chief executive of Tyco International Dennis Kozlowski and second wife Karen leave New York State Supreme Court in June 2005 soon after he was found guilty of stealing $150 million . Kozlowski, poses with two women in toga costumes in a frame taken from an amateur video tape of the lavish $2.1 million, week-long  party for his second wife Karen's 40th birthday . Last month, he completed his parole after spending three years on work-release. He spent almost seven years behind bars for his white-collar crimes although he faced up to 25 years. During his time in jail, he was separated from other prisoners due to his 'high-profile' status. Although he knows that he did wrong, Kozlowski admitted to The New York Times in a recent interview that he feels plenty more on Wall Street did not pay the price. Kozlowski's fall from grace - known as 'deal-a-day' Dennis, he turned Massachusetts-based Tyco from a small firm into a $150billion force  - was a gripping case of schadenfreude for the tabloids because of the gaudy life of excess he had led. In the early 2000s, The New York Post published a picture of him under the headline 'Oink Oink' after revelations emerged of his $6,000 gold-and-burgundy shower curtain in his lavish, $30million 5th Avenue apartment paid for by Tyco. But as he told The New York Times this week: 'I was piggy. But I’m not that person anymore.' Kozlowski's princely lifestyle was legendary - he owned a multi-million-dollar art collection and had an oceanfront estate in Nantucket and a mansion tucked in an exclusive gated community in Boca Raton, Florida. Tyco also paid half of the $2million cost of Kozlowski's second wife, Karen's 40th birthday party in 2001. Held on the island of Sardinia, the bash had a 'Roman orgy' theme and featured an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David urinating Stolichnaya vodka.  Jimmy Buffet was flown in to perform. Karen Mayo (second left)  poses with a friend and two men in gladiator costumes at her $2million birthday bash - half of which was paid for by Tyco . The Tyco CEO once had a home in this exclusive gated community in Boca Raton, Florida. He also owned a home in Nantucket and on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan . The businessman also owned a 130-foot yacht, Endeavor, which he would sail around the world to compete in regattas. Life now, couldn't be more different. Mr Kozlowski's time behind bars has given him perspective on simple pleasures. He loves spending time with his grandchildren, enjoys subway rides, eating avocados - and even trips to the dentist. He also paid tribute to his third wife Kimberly Fusaro - a divorced Wall Street trader whom he met behind bars after she began writing to him. She began visiting him in 2009 and sending fresh fruit and vegetables from the garden of her Long Island cottage. He proposed to her with a $300 Cubic zirconium ring and they got married last year. He also got a job as part of his parole requirement. He borrowed an office from a friend in Midtown and consults on low-profile mergers and acquisitions. He would not discuss his finances with The Times but claimed to have 'no real estate' and a hold a 'minuscule percentage' of the New York Yankees. Fortunately for its  employees, Tyco is still standing, making security systems and employing around 57,000 people. Kozlowski also once owned the yacht Endeavour, pictured while competing in the Americas Cup Jubilee regatta at Cowes, Isle of Wight in 2001 .","Leo Dennis Kozlowski, 68, now lives in a small, rented apartment in midtown Manhattan with third wife Kimberly .

"A man who shot and killed a pregnant woman claims he should not be punished. William DeHayes fired a bullet into the head of 25-year-old Katherine Hoover as he showed her family his gun collection at his home in Florida. Witnesses said DeHayes spun the .22 caliber revolver around on his forefinger, 'gunslinger-style', when it went off, hitting Mrs Hoover in the head. The state has refused to prosecute because the incident was deemed accidental. And though the victim's family has launched an appeal to see him tried for manslaughter, DeHayes insists he has already been punished enough. 'Do you know what it’s like to accidentally shoot someone in the head?' he said to the Daily Beast. Defending himself: William DeHayes (left) claims he has been punished enough by having to live with the fact that he shot Katherine Hoover (right) in the head as he showed off his gun collection last July . 'I have lived through hell ever since. I’ve damn near committed suicide several times. I’ve been seeing doctors and shrinks. 'Now everybody’s pegging me as a killer and a murderer or whatever else they want to say about me. I’m not, OK?' He added: 'I relive that day, July 26, 6:30 p.m., every day, every hour of my life. I hear pops, backfires, people shooting behind me, and I’m scared shitless.' Tragic: Mrs Hoover died hours later, as died her unborn baby. She is survived by her husband and son . Mrs Hoover, whose baby did not survive, was invited over to DeHayes's home with a group of people including her husband Carson last summer. After she was hit, she was taken by ambulance to Bayfront Health Brooksville and from there was airlifted to Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point. Once she was there, doctors operated and removed her baby slightly before 8pm, but tragically he was pronounced dead at just after 8.30pm . She is survived by her husband and her seven-year-old son Nicholas. DeHayes concedes that he should have treated every gun as if it were loaded. However, in his opinion, he has learned his lesson - and has since sold his entire gun collection. Visit: Mr and Mrs Hoover were invited to see DeHayes's guns on July 26, 2014. He has since sold them all . 'I am very familiar with gun safety and I preach it to my wife and everybody. I’ve got no excuses. 'That’s part of my nightmare everyday—knowing that I should have checked it and I didn’t and somebody had to pay the price—not just me.' Mrs Hoover's family insists they will not back down and demand to see justice. But DeHayes says nobody understands his position. 'There’s a difference between an accident and someone knowingly hurting someone else,' he told the Daily Beast. 'I’ve learned a lesson. For me not to allow any guns in this house whatsoever, for me to almost commit suicide several times because I knew better—no one has a clue what it’s like to live like that every day.'","William DeHayes killed Katherine Hoover, 25, and her unborn child in July .

"Just when you thought echidna puggles couldn't get any cuter one shown being cared for at Taronga Zoo in Sydney has upped the charm factor. A Taronga Zoo Wildlife Hospital Supervisor said it was only around 30 days old when it was brought in. Tiny, bald and has no spines, the puggle was found on a walking track at Anna Bay in the Hunter Region of New South Wales and taken to Taronga Zoo. ‘It’s quite possible it fell out of it’s Mum’s pouch. It still would have been in Mum’s pouch at that time. When they get a bit older – 10 to 15 days older – they are left in a burrow,' the Taronga Zoo Wildlife Hospital Supervisor explained in a zoo video. Scroll down for video .

Bath time: The Wildlife Hospital Supervisor at Toronga Zoo cleans the tiny puggle . ‘Mum only comes back then every few days to feed the puggle.

They actually have a very low temperature of 25-27 degrees. The esky is really good at keeping that constant temperature,’ the Wildlife Hospital Supervisor said. The puggle is bathed and cleaned daily. At this age it is tiny, bald and has no spines . At the moment the small puggle only has to be fed every two days at the most . It’ll take a few months before it will look like an echidna. They normally don’t come out of the burrow for six to sevens months. ‘It still needs a lot of tender loving care for the next few months yet,’ she said. Being monotremes, echidnas produce young from eggs which are hatched outside their body, in the same way as birds and most reptiles. Young echidnas are often not fully weaned until they are at least several months old . Although they begin to eat termites and ants soon after leaving the pouch, young echidnas are often not fully weaned until they are several months old. Echidnas evolved between 20 and 50 million years ago, descending from a platypus-like creatures. This ancestor was aquatic, but echidnas adapted to life on land. It will take a few months yet before the puggle will start looking like an echidna .","A puggle found on a walking track at Anna Bay in the Hunter Region of New South Wales was taken to Taronga Zoo .

"A 23-year-old former anorexic  says finding love with her 40-year-old neighbour saved her life. Banker Nina McArthur shrank to little more than five stone after becoming stressed while working for a graduate scheme bank job. The former triathlete, who weighed a healthy eight-and-a-half stone throughout her teens, started obsessing over calories after starting the demanding occupation. Her periods stopped and at her worst she was so thin she drank endless cups of tea and coffee 'to keep warm'. But after moving into her own flat, Miss McArthur started dating her neighbour, IT manager Martin Nash, who helped her on the road to recovery. Nina McArthur was able to recover from anorexia after boyfriend Martin Nash, 40, convinced her to seek help . Miss McNash's weight plummeted to five stone after the stress of a job at a bank triggered anorexia. She is pictured when she was battling the disease (left) and after recovering (right) Miss McArthur was at  low point in her life when she met Mr Nash in 2013. Her periods had stopped and her work colleagues were worried about her health. Mr Nash convinced her to go to the doctor for help . Miss McArthur, from Newton Heath, Manchester, said: 'It's his support that has really got me through. 'It sounds dramatic but, without him I think I would have ended up dead.' Miss McArthur had always been sporty and loved swimming, and competed in her first triathalon aged nine. The pair formed a friendship in June 2013 after Miss McArthur moved out of her parent's home. 'I'd had a few hard years,' she said. 'After competing in triathlons from the age of nine, I stopped when I developed hyperthermia during a race in 2009. 'I decided to focus my energy on studying and started my bank job. I found it incredibly stressful and began limiting what I ate. 'When I was training as an athlete I'd always been quite strict with my diet. Then a coach told me if I lost weight I'd run quicker and I limited it even more. 'I started taking those dangerous eating habits even further and began skipping meals.' But Miss McArthur's diet soon got more severe, and her weight plummeted to just six stone. 'Mum would try and force me to eat my favourite childhood foods like corn beef stew and jam on toast, but the thought made me sick,' she said. Now she has recovered, Miss McArthur says she is enjoying life. 'I've been promoted at work and I've recently moved in with Martin. We're very settled and he makes me smile everyday,' she said . Miss Nash said at her worst she looked like a 'walking skeleton' when she weighed 5st. She is pictured battling the illness (left) and now (right), weighing nearly eight stone . 'It wasn't that I was desperate to be skinny, I was desperate to be in control. I was so thin I hadn't had a period since I was 18. 'It got pretty extreme. I would not eat all day if I was drinking with mates in the evening.' After collapsing on a work training course in April 2011, she went to her GP and was advised to go to an outpatient clinic. But she refused to go, wanting to recover herself. Slowly she started eating more and her weight eventually crept up to seven-and-a-half stone. She believed she had recovered, but after meeting a man who competed in triathlons, she was encouraged to play sport again. She began starving herself and training on tiny amounts of food. She said: 'I started to look like a walking skeleton. 'My boyfriend encouraged me to put on weight, but it was no use and we broke up after a year together.' It was then that the anorexia started to dominate her life. She said: 'I moved out on my own and fell to five and half stone. I had no energy, couldn't concentrate and kept fainting. 'If I went shopping I'd have to buy children's clothes, though most of the time I tried to cover my body in baggy tops. 'Though it was clear I had a problem, I pretended I was okay. I'd take photographs of myself surrounded by food and put them on social media. 'Sometimes I'd put a huge meal on the table and take a picture of it. Miss McArthur said Mr Nash came to visit her for her 23rd birthday, spent in hospital. 'It was actually one of the most special birthdays I have ever had,' she said. The pair are pictured now Miss McNash has recovered . Miss McArthur has now written a blog to share her story with others. She is pictured during her battle with the illness - when she would post pictures of herself with food to fool worried friends and family . 'I wanted people to think I was eating normally. But my secret was impossible to hide.' Not only were her work colleagues worried, but when her periods completely stopped, Miss McArthur began to worry about how her anorexia was damaging her health. Shorty afterwards, Miss McArthur met Martin Nash, who lived two flats beneath her. 'At first we were just friends,' she said. 'But over time, we started spending more and more time together. 'He was concerned about me and started inviting me over for dinner. I'd starve all day if I was going round, but at least I was eating something.' In January 2014, weighing little more than five stone, Miss McArthur collapsed at work. 'I knew then I needed to get sorted. Martin became my rock. 'He'd make me feel normal and take me out for coffee and cake. I became so close to his family, they were my extended support network. 'He took me to the GP who said my weight was dangerously low and that I was suffering from liver damage. 'Because of that he referred me for an outpatient appointment, which Martin accompanied me to. 'Friendship quickly turned into a relationship, he supported me every step of the way.' Miss McArthur credits Mr Nash with her recovery. She said: 'He loved me when I was at my worst, and I don't think I'd be here if it wasn't for him' A week before her 23rd birthday Miss McArthur became a patient at The Priory Hospital, Cheadle Royal. It was there she began writing her blog, Nina's Writing Retreat, to tell others about her progress. In it, she recalls how Martin came to visit her on her birthday. Writing on her blog, she said: 'It was actually one of the most special birthdays I have ever had. Martin brought me flowers and a travel scrabble board to play in the evening and was allowed to take me over to John Lewis café for an hour for a coffee. 'My 90-year-old Nana visited to give me a great big hug and numerous messages of love and support were received from family and friends. 'I finally wanted to be kind to myself again and began to understand why I had previously acted the way I did. 'Luckily, I realised that I wanted to get better.' Miss McArthur was put on a high calorie diet, and within 10 weeks she'd put on two stone. She said: 'Initially it was very difficult, but I kept going. 'As I grew I began to love my body, and my new shape. I didn't want to punish myself anymore.' Now Miss McArthur weighs nearly eight stone, and has turned over a new leaf. She said: 'I've been promoted at work and I've recently moved in with Martin. We're very settled and he makes me smile every day. 'He loved me when I was at my worst, and I don't think I'd be here if it wasn't for him.'

"Thousands of Eurostar passengers were facing travel chaos today as 17 trains were cancelled following a death on the high speed line. Services were delayed for five hours after a person was hit by a train near Harrietsham in Kent. Dejected-looking travellers were pictured crammed into the terminal at St Pancras station - with some customers on axed services facing delays of up to two days while the backlog clears. Frustrated: Thousands of Eurostar passengers cram into the terminal at St Pancras station in London today . Investigators from British Transport Police said the death, which happened at around 11.40am, was 'non-suspicious' although it took hours for services teams to clear the tracks. Services resumed at around 4.30pm in both directions, although hundreds of customers were left trying to organise alternative transport or accommodation in London on Monday night. Demo Oduyeni, 38, spoke of his frustration at clueless staff who told him he would have to wait until Wednesday to travel home to Antwerp. He said: 'The people I spoke to didn't know anything, they just kept saying check the updates on the website, but on the website there was nothing. Death on line: A Eurostar service was stopped near Harrietsham in Kent after a person was hit by a train . Huge delays: Dejected customers waited in St Pancras after the line was shut following the incident in Kent . 'When I got here it just said we had to queue up as someone had jumped in front of a train. 'I've been waiting here for two hours now just in case I can get on one of the trains. It's cold and I've been buying myself cups of tea to keep warm. I've been told I will probably have to wait until Wednesday to get home. 'By the time I get on a train tonight it will be too late to get a transfer, I could get a bus but it will take over six hours. Tomorrow all the booked Eurostar passengers will take priority.' The Belgian computer programmer was a regular traveller and had been visiting friends. He added: 'I studied here and they will give me a place to stay, but the tourists will have to find hotels. 'They only give you £150-a-night for a room and you have to send an invoice.' Chaos: Some travellers on axed servies are facing delays of up to two days while the backlog clears . Services resumed at 4.30pm in both directions, around five hours after the person was hit by the train . 'Eurostar trains are subject to delay and cancellation this afternoon,' the company said in a statement on its website. Eurostar runs trains through the Channel Tunnel, operated by Eurotunnel, connecting passengers between the British and French capitals, and other cities including Brussels. The company said emergency services were attending the incident in between Ashford International station and Ebbsfleet International station in Kent and travel on the high-speed line would resume when the track was re-opened. Laurens Schellekens, 23, was one of 35 University of Brussels students left stranded as they made their way home from the London International Model United Nations conference for budding diplomats. The international law postgraduate said: 'We've been working all weekend and had to cut our day off to explore the city short after we heard the trains weren't running. Hundreds of customers were left trying to organise alternative transport or accommodation in London tonight . Investigators from British Transport Police said the death, which happened at around 11.40am, was 'non-suspicious' although it took hours for services teams to clear the tracks . 'We've been left in the cold station waiting to see if we will get on a train tomorrow, but it's not looking good. 'There was at least 100 students at the conference, they come from all around the world. 'But there were maybe five at least groups from Belgium and France that may be in the same situation as us. 'We've been given money to find somewhere to stay, but it's an expensive city to do anything in. 'The group have been modelling crisis management, maybe we could show the train guys something.'","Services delayed for five hours after a person was hit by a train in Kent .

"He liked nothing better than to nibble on a shortbread biscuit with a cup of Earl Grey and a dash of honey. You could often hear him singing Martha and the Vandellas hits or bopping along to some reggae. And if trouble ever loomed for his owner Cara Cosson, he could always be relied on to bark like a dog. Scroll down for video . JoeJoe the African Grey parrot, pictured left and right with owner Cara Cosson, 45, was snatched from his home in Bedford during a burglary - but nothing else was taken . But something dastardly happened to JoeJoe the parrot the day someone broke into her house while she was out. A heartless intruder kidnapped the 16-year-old African Grey – and left a threatening letter made from newspaper headline clippings inside his cage. The note is understood to have warned: ‘If you want to see the bird again text [phone number]. If you go to the police I will kill him.’ Quite what fate has befallen this remarkable performing bird is a mystery that has so far involved the police, a psychic, Parrot Society experts and an international appeal on the internet. The thief even left a threatening note in JoeJoe's cage, made out of newspaper headline clippings, which read: ‘If you want to see the bird again text [phone number]. If you go to the police I will kill him’ Alas, there has been no word from him since. Not even on Twitter. The abductor struck two weeks ago while Miss Cosson, a 45-year-old contracts officer, was out at work. She returned to her home in Bedford after her mother phoned her to say that there had been a break-in. But when she walked in, to her absolute despair she realised that JoeJoe was missing. ‘He is not a pet, he is family,’ said Miss Cosson, who has no children. ‘I am devastated. People will think it’s just a bird but it’s not. It feels to me that my child has been kidnapped. I’m trying not to think the worst but I suspect the worst may already have happened.’ Nothing else was taken in the robbery and Miss Cosson, a divorcee who split up with her partner earlier this year, believes she knows who is responsible. ‘The person who stole him has taken him because that is the only thing that would be able to hurt me,’ she said. The kidnap-style letter did not ask for money but said the bird would be killed if she called police. But she did call them – and an immediate investigation was started by what ribald locals nicknamed the flying squad. Bedfordshire police did arrest and bail a 40-year-old man on suspicion of burglary but are still searching for the bird. Miss Cosson, who launched a Facebook appeal and pledged she would ‘never give up’, even consulted a clairvoyant in a desperate attempt to be reunited with the parrot that has been her companion since it was 14 weeks old. The psychic used tarot cards to conclude that JoeJoe was still alive, and would be returned soon. But she reportedly warned: ‘He won’t be in a good way.’ Looking on the brighter side, it should not be too difficult to identify JoeJoe should a stranger happen to come across him. Play some Motown music and he will instantly dance to the beat on his perch. Wave a shortbread biscuit at him (Waitrose all-butter selection are his favourites) and he’ll happily sing for his supper. He loves to whistle the Nina Simone version of Summertime and enjoys The Whispers’ hit Needle In A Haystack. ‘He’s a real character and everyone who met him loves him,’ Miss Cosson said. ‘A lot of birds that are stolen actually die from shock, so I’m really worried. I just want him back.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","16-year-old African Grey was taken while owner Cara Cosson was at work .

"A Melbourne woman has proved that a car on a hot summer’s day really can be hot enough to fry an egg. Actress Katherine Moss incredibly baked cookies, eggs, pasta and grilled cheese successfully on the dashboard of her car on a hot day with frightening results. The 'car cooking' series has a very important message, indicating that when a child or pet are left in a car on a hot day they are essentially being put in an oven. ‘The message is clear: don’t cook your pet,’ Ms Moss told Daily Mail Australia. ‘It started as a bit of fun but when the food started cooking so well and really quickly I thought “can you imagine a kid or a dog in the car?” It’s nuts to me.’ ‘It’s so important for people to realise what happens inside a hot car. Maybe people don’t know and there’s a level of ignorance about just how hot a car becomes.’ Scroll down for video . Katherine Moss was able to cook spaghetti in a pot of cold water overnight and fry an egg in just an hour . Ms Moss was amazed that the car became so hot that pasta could be cooked in a pot of cold water . The actress is the proud owner of a beautiful pug named Gil and can't believe that people still leave children and animals alone in cars with the window cracked open . According to Kidsafe Victoria: . On a 29 degree Celsius day a car can reach 44 degrees in just 10 minutes . It will reach a deadly 60 degrees in 20 minutes. Leaving the window down a few centimetres does little . The smaller the child or animal, the greater the risk. A young child will quickly dehydrate, lapse into unconsciousness and may never fully recover. The cause is particularly close to the 29-year-old’s heart as she owns a beautiful two-year-old pug named Gil and is often startled when she sees dogs left in cars with the window ajar. Ms Moss first started by putting a tray of dough on the dashboard, curious about the results. She was amazed when she had well-cooked cookies in just an hour and a half. ‘The cookies made my car smell amazing so I thought “maybe I should do this more often,”’ Ms Moss laughed. The same could not be said for the egg and grilled cheese experiments. ‘I had to air my car out after that and was scared I’d develop an ant problem so I think I’m done with car cooking for a little while,’ she said. However an interesting result was the awful taste of the food cooked by sunlight. ‘I ate the cookies but I learned quickly not to eat the car food. I didn’t feel very good afterwards! ‘I definitely wouldn’t promote it as an alternative method to cooking. More just as a demonstration,' she joked. The experiment started as a joke to prove how hot her car became in the Melbourne sun . In just fifteen minutes the chocolate was able to melt and become fondue on the first day of Autumn . Ms Moss quickly realised that the car was effectively an oven on a hot day. She decided the images could become a powerful way to send an message about the danger of leaving children and pets alone in hot cars . The NIDA-trained actress also quickly learnt the importance of putting down a tea towel when the tray left a melted mark on her dash. ‘I had to use oven mitts because the pans got that hot,’ she said. In February a 22-month-old boy died when he was left inside a hot vehicle parked on the driveway of a Kyneton daycare centre in Victoria. Ambulance Victoria would not comment on the case, but had issued repeated warnings against leaving children in cars. In the first five weeks of 2015 paramedics were called to 200 cases of children overheating in cars. The website series has quickly gained interest and Ms Moss was even able to prove that it really can be hot enough to fry an egg in a hot car . Ms Moss couldn't believe that the egg had cooked so well that it was brown when she flipped it . Ms Moss can't believe that some people are thoughtless enough to leave their pets alone in cars with the window cracked open . Advanced life support paramedic Ben Dalton said two children have died in the last few years after being left in hot cars in Victoria and says it's frustrating the message isn't getting through. 'Children can't regulate their body temperature like adults can, which puts them at significant risk,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's never okay to leave a child locked in a car, even for a minute or two.' The Victorian state government said it will increase penalties for leaving children in hot cars, with fines up to $3700 and jail time increased from three months to six months. Ms Moss argues that it is never okay to leave a child or animal unattended, even during the cooler months of the year. 'A typical Australian summer day that we’ve all experienced is sitting in the car and burning yourself with the seatbelt buckle.' ‘But what’s scary is that some of the car cooking days in Melbourne weren't even sunny days, it was just hot.’ Ms Moss herself has a beautiful two-year-old pug named Gil . Ms Moss was able to grill cheese on the dashboard of a car, but learned to put down a tea towel after the tray left a 'melted' mark on her car . Ms Moss couldn't believe how quickly and thoroughly the cheese melted and the bread became toasted . Ms Moss was also able to cook the eggs and fondue on an autumn day in Sydney, proving that there is a danger of a stuffy car quickly becoming overheated on seemingly cool days. Within just 15 minutes she had melted chocolate for fondue. The egg took around an hour, but when Moss flipped the egg she was amazed to find it had already become brown. The spaghetti was the most astonishing result. The 29-year-old left a pot of cold water and hard spaghetti strands in the car. By morning she had uninviting but nonetheless cooked pasta. She has quickly gained a following as well as a range of interesting remarks from friends. ‘You’re not living in your car, are you?’ asked a friend. ‘And a car gets you from A to B. So versatile!’ another person mused. ‘Get a stove already,’ another quipped. ‘I don’t understand how people could have a dog and not treat it like a person, like part of the family,' she said . Her car cooking has been referred to as ‘meals-in-wheels’ and her ‘solar oven.’ ‘How good! Go to work, finish and get in your car with your meal cooked already! Winning!’ remarked another friend. However, the realisation that a vehicle can become so intensely hot so quickly is also startling. ‘I still see animals in cars with a cracked window and it baffles me that it still happens in this day and age when there’s enough literature and information about not doing that sort of thing.’ ‘I don’t understand how people could have a dog and not treat it like a person, like part of the family. ‘There are no government funded ads to explain what actually happens when children and pets are left in hot cars. ‘It’s tragic when children die in the back of cars. People need to be aware, it needs to be at the forefront of people’s minds. The first experiment was with cookie dough and was a massive success when they baked in just over an hour . Ms Moss was also impressed when her car smelt delicious thanks to the aroma of baked goods . ‘I think these images are powerful because they make an impact without being grotesque or in poor taste.’ The photos, initially intended as a joke, have taken on a life of their own as a way of raising awareness about the reality of a hot car. ‘I think it’s a really good demonstration of what not to do with your children or your pets,’ said Ms Moss. ‘If it helps raise any kind of awareness it’s taken an activity that I did with too much time on my hands and turned it into something quite helpful.’ The hilarious photos, initially intended as a joke, have taken on a life of their own as a way of raising awareness about the reality of a hot car .","A Melbourne woman has cooked food in her car in an online photo series .

"A poltergeist that maliciously terrorised a home for four months by hurling stones and knives at the people who lived there has been described as one of the most spookiest supernatural occupations in Australia. Tony Healy and Paul Cropper spent several days at the Humpty Doo home in the Northern Territory when the poltergeist was in full swing back in 1998. The pair have published details of the encounter in their new book Australian Poltergeist: The Stone-throwing Spook of Humpty Doo and Many Other Cases. Scroll down for video . Andrew Agius found the word CAR made from small pebbles in the bathroom of the Humpty Doo home in the Northern Territory back in 1998. Words referred to their friend Troy Raddatz who was incinerated in a car accident just a few kilometres from their house . The book details 50 of Australia's poltergeist occupations dating back to 1845 - with Humpty Doo coming in at number two. The ghostly encounters at the McMinns Drive property started in January 1998 when the poltergeist started dropping pebbles from the ceiling onto the floor, tables, beds and heads. On the same night, residents Andrew and Kirsty Agius, Dave Clark, his partner Jill Summerville and their mate Doug Murphy noticed knives, small batteries, spanners, shards of broken glass and other objects being dropped or hurled across rooms. They called in two Catholic priests and one Greek Orthodox priest to try and exorcise it. But all attempts failed and one priest even reported seeing a crucifix being hurled across the room. 'Whatever these things are they can run rings around us. My guess is some of the cases involve spirits of recently deceased people,' Mr Healy told Daily Mail Australia. Jill Summerville was photographed beside some of the graffiti left by the poltergeist on the walls of the house during its four month stint at the home . The ghostly encounters at the McMinns Drive property started in January 1998 when the poltergeist started dropping pebbles from the ceiling onto the floor, tables, beds and heads . The residents were soon subjected to sinister words and symbols being drawn on the walls and floor in marker pens, scrabble tiles and pebbles. The first series of words that appeared in the house - 'FIRE', 'SKIN', 'CAR', 'HELP' and 'TROY' - referred to their friend Troy Raddatz who was incinerated in a car accident just a few kilometres from their house before the first sign of the poltergeist appeared. Over the next couple of days the poltergeist cranked up the level of vandalism, causing serious damage - a CD player was thrown to the floor and destroyed, windows and glass cabinet doors were smashed by ashtrays and other flying objects. Healy and Cropper spent five days and nights at the property in April 1998. 'We don’t know of anyone who visited the house and left sceptical. The poltergeist was pretty obliging by turning it on,' Mr Healy said. Pebbles from the driveway would regularly shower from the ceiling without warning, while knives, small batteries, spanners, shards of broken glass and other objects would be hurled across rooms . This is a collection of the items the poltergeist regularly hurled across rooms, according to residents . 'I saw an object materialise in mid-air. I was chatting to a lady and she was sitting across a wooden table across from me. She was reading a newspaper article with both her hands in plain sight. 'There were other instances where knives, bullets… whizzed past our heads. Showering of stones also happened three times while we were there. 'The messages on the floor and walls had a malicious flavour to them, but the thing is if it really wanted to hurt me… it could have embedded the knife in my back rather than hurl it past.' After four months, the poltergeist left as suddenly as it arrived and its departure is still unexplained. This corkscrew held by Andrew was also a regular favourite of the poltergeist . Tony Healy and Paul Cropper spent several days at the Humpty Doo home in the Northern Territory when the poltergeist was in full swing back in 1998 and have published their encounter in a new book . Since witnessing the events at Humpty Doo 17 years ago, the pair visited various other sites to interview people who have lived through similar experiences. In their book, the Healy and Cropper cover in detail 11 of the most remarkable episodes in Australia. Australian Poltergeist will be available in March.

"Helplessly stuck in a patch of mud, this tiny zebra foal appeared doomed to a prolonged and agonising death. Then along came the most unlikely of rescuers - a gigantic bull rhino who had been attracted by the creature's desperate struggles and mewling cries. It was the work of a moment for the enormous animal to hoist the foal out of the mud and to safety. But tragically this was one rescue that did not have a happy ending. Oblivious to its own strength, the rhino ended up impaling the zebra on its horn. Scroll down for video . Stuck in the mud: A bull rhino spots a zebra foal stuck in mud near a watering hole at the Madikwe Game Reserve and decides to start prodding the hapless youngster with his horn . Up you come: After a few seconds prodding the foal, the bull decides to hook it with his horn and yank it from the sticky morass - a move which seems to have come too quickly for the weakened youngster . Brutal: Although now free, the foal is almost sent flying by the bull rhino's sudden movement . Tragic: The young zebra slumps heavily down onto the rhino's horn. It is not clear whether this is the point that the foal was disembowelled by the bull's clumsy rescue . Roel van Muiden, a field guide and wildlife photographer, spotted the foal stuck in a deep and pitiless patch of mud while he was showing visitors around the Madikwe Game Reserve in South Africa. Nearby a bull rhino was chasing some females, then being chased away in return, but the foal's mother and her herd were nowhere to be seen. 'The foal must have been there for quite some time,' wrote Mr van Muiden in Africa Geographic. The bull rhino, he went on, finally gave up on his futile advances. Wandering down to the water, he found the hapless foal. Curious, the huge beast began prodding the youngster with his horn. After a while the bull, growing impatient with his toy, sank his snout deep into the mire before quickly lifting the foal from the mud. This was no altruistic rescue mission, having helped it escape the morass he merely dropped the animal and wandered off. But then he came back to the exhausted youngster for another look. Apparently wanting to see the foal from another angle, he used his horn to move it into a different position, and disembowelled it. Dropping it again, the bull flopped to the mud himself for a roll-around, almost crushing the dying baby zebra. The stricken animal didn't last much longer. Boredom: The bull rhino had earlier got nowhere with his advances towards a couple of nearby cows . Mr van Muisen said many things went through his mind as he watched the tragedy unfold, but his foremost thought was to 'let nature be nature'. 'I have had many comments from people seeing the photos asking why I did not retrieve the foal from the mud,' he said. 'The zebra’s herd was gone so even if I could have, he would not have survived as his mother and harem were nowhere to be seen and thus he would have died from starvation.' Mr van Muisen added that the foal's mother probably knew her child was caught in a hopeless situation. She probably had good reason for abandoning it to its fate, he said. Despite the foal's sad and early end, he said he felt lucky to see what he described as 'an amazing interaction between two species.' 'I have been guiding for almost ten years and may go on for many and still never witness something as amazing and melancholy as this.'","South African Roel van Muiden saw the incident at Madike Game Reserve .

"An admin worker believes she has found the world's longest Hula Hoop after pulling a version of the snack measuring almost five inches from her bag of crisps. Vicky Worrall, 26, from Runcorn, Cheshire, discovered the mammoth morsel when she picked up the bag of cheese and onion-flavoured Hula Hoops during her lunch break. Despite describing herself as a 'hopeless dieter', the mother-of-one was able to save the snack, and now plans to sell it on eBay to raise money for charity. Admin worker Vicky Worrall, 26, believes she has found the world's longest Hula Hoop after pulling a five inch version of the snack from her bag of crisps . 'I bought the crisps from the man with the sandwich van, because I'm hopeless at dieting and fancied a treat,' said Ms Worrall. 'I couldn't believe it when I opened the packet and found that whopper. I kept laughing - we all did - it's just funny. 'I've put it on eBay because I've been wanting to raise some money for charity for a while but didn't know what to do.' Ms Worrall's crisp measures four and a half inches long, and she decided to sell it after learning that a three-inch version discovered by musician Stuart Hampton, 31, from Darnhill in Greater Manchester sold for £712 in October last year. Ms Worrall's huge Hula Hoop, compared to the size normally found the the packs of crisps . Ms Worrall now faces a battle to keep the crisp away from boyfriend Lee Schon, and her three-year-old daughter Kaiyla, in case one of them eats it. 'He thinks I'm going a bit mad, but also that it's hilarious,' Ms Worrall said of her partner. 'He keeps threatening to eat it - I would be so angry if he ate it. 'We only give Kaiyla crisps as a very rare, occasional, treat, but I know it would be gone in a flash if she got hold of it. 'Hula Hoops aren't even my favourite crisp, I just fancied a bag. 'Whoever would have thought crisps would be so funny?' Ms Worrall, who found the crisp on Friday, is yet to decide which charity the money raise will go to, but the crisp has already attracted a bid of £30. In the listing, she wrote: 'I have what I believe to be the world's longest hula hoop ( cheese & onion ), beating a previous eBay seller who's hula hoop was measuring in at 3' long. Ms Worrall's crisp measures four and a half inches long, and she decided to sell it after learning that a three-inch version sold for £712 in October last year . 'On measurement mine is a staggering 4 and a half inches. Please see pictures. 'Only serious bidders please. Happy Bidding! 'I will send via special delivery.' There is currently no official longest Hula Hoop as such finds are not covered by any Guinness World Records record category. However, a spokesman told MailOnline that the closest would be the record for the largest bag of potato chips which weighed 2,515lb 7.52oz, and was made by Corkers Crisps in Pymoor, Cambridgeshire, UK, on  September 13, 2013. Record categories involving large food only cover scaled-up versions of the items, which must be made in the same way as the ordinary sized versions, but on a grand scale. 'Guinness World Records does not monitor cases where people find unusually large versions of an item of manufactured food that has been made in a factory,' the spokesman said. 'These aberrations are not uncommon and finding them does not involve the challenge of record-breaking.' KP Snacks, the Hula Hoop parent company, is yet to comment on the find.","Vicky Worrall, 26, found snack in her bag of cheese and onion Hula Hoops .

"A daredevil has taken parkour to its limits by performing reckless stunts from a moving, tilted truck. Abdullah Omar AlAli, 21, got into the street gymnastics craze just a year ago in his home city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates - but backflips and handstands on park benches were just not enough. Instead he pulls his stunts from a Toyota Land Cruiser, which a driver tips precariously onto two wheels in another dangerous procedure known as 'sidewalk skiing'. Dicing with death: Abdullah Omar AlAli, 21, got into the street gymnastics craze parkour just a year ago - and now performs on a moving truck . Talented: The daredevil accepts that what he does is dangerous, but says he wants to draw attention to the thrill of parkour for everyone . Mr AlAli, who has no formal training but a black belt in Taekwondo, begins his stunts by climbing out of the truck's rear driver side window while it is moving on its side. He then scrambles onto the top where he performs handstands and backflips and even gives a salute to his cameraman. Inspired by military obstacle courses, parkour involves turning everyday pieces of street furniture into objects to be ducked under, swung from, vaulted and climbed. The discipline has in turn inspired freerunning, the urban athletics movement followed by tens thousands of people around the world. 'Sidewalk skiing' is another dangerous craze altogether, and was popularised in 2013 by a team of daredevils in neighbouring Saudi Arabia. Sidewalk skiing: The craze of tipping a moving truck onto two wheels was popularised by a group of daredevils in Saudi Arabia in 2013 . 'My inspiration is Dubai's Prime Minster Sheikh Mohammed who said that UAE does not have a word for impossible', the 21-year-old said . Backflip: The amateur daredevil said he wanted to push the urban gymnastics craze to its limit in his home city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates . To tip a truck onto its side a driver usually uses an asymmetrical ramp, then there is the difficult part - balancing it without allowing it to tip over while a daredevil scrambles into position on top. Mr AlAli now wants to push parkour even closer to its limits. 'While the stunt is risky, I wanted to show how far people could push their skills with this sport,' he said. 'My inspiration is Dubai's Prime Minster Sheikh Mohammed who said that UAE does not have a word for impossible - it does not exist in our lexicon'. Mr AlAli also explained that his next goal is to create a parkour training facility where people all over the region can come and discover the sport. He said: 'I want to convince the municipality to provide a park made especially for parkour so they can attract more people, who can practice and teach in a safe place. 'I want to show the world that the UAE is a place where you can find talented people.' Poise: The truck is not moving in all of his shots, but must be when it tilts on its side - with a driver who is able to keep it balanced . Don't try this at home: With long stretches of highway and more than enough desert, the UAE is a suitable place to develop the craze .

"The list may surprise you but falcons, live lobsters and pet pigs are some of the bizarre things that airlines will allow to fly. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has a prohibited items list as long as your arm, but antlers, cannisters of human remains and monkeys also make the cut. In the case of a monkey, it is not just any old monkey. It is only service monkeys that are welcome aboard. The Transportation Security Administration allows service monkey through security screening . A service monkey is a type of assistance animal, similar to an assistance dog, that is specially trained to help people with quadriplegia, severe spinal cord injuries, or other mobility impairments. TSA officers visually inspect the service monkey and will coach the handler on how to hold the monkey during the visual inspection. The inspection process may require the handler to take off the monkey’s diaper, but he can still board the plan. A falcon can also buckle up next to you. German airline Lufthansa announced it will soon allow its passengers to travel with falcons. Lufthansa will soon allow falcons on board, while Etihad Airways already allows customers this privilege . Live lobsters (pictured) and even crabs are perfectly fine to bring on as checked-in baggage on many airlines . TSA officers visually inspect the service monkey and will coach the handler on how to hold the monkey during the visual inspection . Later this year, travellers will be able to take their hunting birds onboard in a newly-designed device called the ‘Falcon Master’ tray, which can be fitted with a cage. The move is set to prove popular with the airline’s Middle East customers, where falconry is hugely popular. The United Arab Emirates runs wild falcon conservation projects as well as breeding farms and veterinary hospitals for the animals. For centuries hunting with falcons was a major source of meat in the harsh desert region, and the birds remain a national emblem, found on everything from corporate logos to banknotes. But with wildlife under pressure, hunting has been restricted, and many affluent Emiratis now travel abroad to locations as far as Morocco, Pakistan and Central Asia. In some countries and airlines, the Vietnamese pot-bellied pig is also now very trendy and has been legally classified as a 'companion animal' Just in case you did not know, crematory remains are also allowed to be taken on board a flight . Antlers are also allowed to be transported on planes as long as they have the skull attached . Bowling balls also make the cut, with some airlines allowing the sporting equipment to travel with you . Other recreational equipment allowed is scuba diving gear for those who are partial to the past time . The same applies to fishing rods which can also go with their owners when they take to the skies . For example, Etihad Airways based in Abu Dhabi regulations accept the carriage of falcons in the main aircraft cabin provided that all the necessary documents have been obtained. They also accept falcons as checked baggage. Meanwhile, live lobsters and even crabs are perfectly fine to check on many airlines, some even let you pre-book them as you would your dog. It is all dependent on how you pack them though as individual airline regulations may differ slightly. In some countries and airlines, the Vietnamese pot-bellied pig is also now very trendy and has been legally classified as a 'companion animal'. But it is not just animals that some passengers have taken on flights. Christmas trees, crematory remains, your own personal parachute and antlers as long as the skull is wrapped have also been allowed on flights in the past too.","Transport Security Administration will clear service monkeys for flight .

"How about some Vegemite ice-cream with Weet Bix on top? The ultra-Aussie confection is just one of the weird and wacky flavours being concocted by an adventurous, multi-award winning, ice-cream connoisseur. Dooley's Ice Cream parlour in Apollo Bay, on Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, is known for producing some of the oddest combinations in ice-cream - and its Vegemite flavour may be the strangest yet. Owner Dooley Milner told Daily Mail Australia the flavour is a massive hit with international tourists and 'gets people talking'. Dooley's Ice Cream Parlour on the Great Ocean Road has released a Vegemite flavour . But others are not so keen, saying the black, salty yeast byproduct is not well suited to ice cream. Dooley's, which has won 370 awards for excellence, often creates unique flavours in the run-up to special events. Just before Christmas, Dooley's made a Xmas Pudding flavour and for Australia Day the shop made a Lamington flavour. But it's Vegemite  that has stood the test of time. The parlour first introduced the unique ice-cream on Australia Day in 2011 and it has been on the shelves ever since. In 2012, it won a silver award at the Royal Melbourne Show and the parlour's vanilla flavour has been voted the number one ice-cream in Australia at the Australian Grand Dairy Awards 2015. 'I've stuck with it since. It has been received quite well.' Mr Milner said.

"Prince William launched his four-day visit to China today with a ceremony to bring good fortune. The second in line to the throne found himself in the unusual position of having to paint the eyes on a larger than life sheep - British cartoon character Shaun the Sheep, no less. 'You know I can't do two things at once,' he joked with the photographers who asked him to pose up with his artwork. Scroll down for video . Prince William smiles as he paints the eyes on a Shaun the Sheep model during a ceremony in China . The Prince is on a four-day visit to China with the sheep-marking ceremony signalled the launch of the first ever Year of Cultural Exchange between the UK and China . He added approvingly: 'It's not particularly stylish but it will pass.' The sheep-marking ceremony signalled the launch of the first ever Year of Cultural Exchange between the UK and China, a showcase of innovation for British goods and services. In the Chinese calendar this is the Year of the Sheep - and with Aardman Animation's Shaun being the UK's most famous export of the species, the British Council thought it might be fun to marry the two. The ceremony took place in the gardens of the residence of the British Ambassador, Barbara Woodward. William was shown five sculptures of Shaun, each decorated by a different artist, which are among 50 such sculptures to be displayed across China and later auctioned off in aid of the Beijing Cultural Development Fund. In the Chinese calendar this is the Year of the Sheep - and with Aardman Animation's Shaun being the UK's most famous export of species, the British Council thought it might be fun to marry the two . The prince joked with photographers who wanted him to pose and paint the eyes on the sheep, saying 'You know I can't do two things at once' The prince gamely agreed to finish decorating a particularly patriotic animal, covered in the Union Flag, by painting his eyes. Dotting the eyes of the traditional lions used in Lion Dances is thought to bring good fortune and happiness - and it is hoped that by William doing this he will bring such benefits to the Year of Cultural Exchange. It also ties in with the Chinese idiom 'san yang kai tai',which means 'the advent of Spring brings prosperity'. The prince was accompanied by Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who said: 'We are incredibly proud of our creative industries, they are one of our biggest success stories and a tremendous driver of economic growth. Crowds of people gathered to catch a glimpse of the second in line to the throne during a visitor to the British ambassador's official residence in Beijing . Prince William greets a young baby who was brought to the ceremony. The Duke's visit is the highest-profile visit by a member of the royal family for 30 years . 'The Year of Cultural Exchange will be a wonderful celebration of UK and Chinese creative talent and will help forge new business relations between our two nations. ' Nick Marchand Director of Arts and Creative Industries at the British Embassy said William was a 'fantastic ambassador' for the UK. 'It's wonderful that he can be here to launch this for us,' he said. Earlier William visited Shijia Hutong, an elegantly restored courtyard house, resurrected from dilapidation two years ago with funding from the Prince's Foundation, set up by his father, Prince Charles. Dressed in a smart suit, the prince was greeted by Matthew Hu, China Representative of the Prince's School of traditional arts and Drew Ross, the China MD for the Prince's Foundation.

Today marks the first of a four day visit to China after the Duke of Cambridge earlier visited Japan . The prince chatted pleasantly about the weather and remarked on what a nice day it was - not realising the air pollution index for Beijing today is 140, nearly six times the WHO recommended maximum. He also met with groups of disadvantaged rural children in urban Beijing. He chatted about the various challenges they face, and was presented with a small hand-drawn picture, drawn by a 10-year old migrant child from poverty stricken Henan province named Wu Qiuyun. The picture shows a collection of little houses surrounded by foliage and prompted William to 'that will look nice in George's bedroom'. He was was also introduced to Zhao Chen, 14, who is effectively blind and, with the assistance of his mother, learning opera singing. Mr Zhao said: 'My dream is to go to your palace to sing opera'. Duke replied: 'Well, you've met the right man. We might be able to arrange something.'","Second in line to the throne launched his four-day visit to China today .

"Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney enjoyed a night out with friends at a gay police ball after receiving a standing ovation for her tearful speech at the Ukip conference. Wearing a gold lamé skirt, high-necked black top and forest-green shrug she was seen arriving at the 'Fabulous Thirties' themed event at the Great Danes Hotel in Maidstone  on Saturday. Just hours earlier she had read a moving poem about a transsexual who committed suicide during her address at the annual Ukip meeting in Margate, Kent. Hundreds danced the night away at the Kent Gay Police Association Charity Ball which raised money for transgender organisation TGPals and the Bluebells Children’s Short Break Centre. Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney was seen arriving at Kent Gay Police Association Charity Ball on Saturday with two friends . Alan Pughsley, the new Chief Constable of Kent, showed his support by attending the event which saw a cabaret performance from Lola Lasagne as well as a disco. Ms Maloney completed her look for the evening with black heels, layered gold necklace, black handbag  and understated make-up. The twice-married 61-year-old, who underwent surgery in November last year to make her face appear more feminine, is almost two years  into her transition period to change gender. As a boxing promoter she helped Lennox Lewis to become world heavyweight champion. The longtime Ukip supporter was praised by Nigel Farage on Saturday as proof that his party was 'open to everyone'. Just hours earlier she had read a moving poem about a transsexual who committed suicide during her address at the annual Ukip meeting in Margate, Kent . Ms Maloney also said she hoped to help people understand more about transsexual issues and added 'we are human beings too'. She was given a standing ovation after reading a poem from two children to their transsexual parent who had committed suicide. 'This poem I am going to read is a really personal poem for me and my family,' she said. 'Both my daughters and I met this brother and sister and my daughters feared they might have to do this at my funeral but we pulled through all our dark moments.' The audience broke into applause to show their support when Ms Maloney's voice started to crack during the reading. Wearing a gold lamé skirt, high-necked black top and forest-green shrug she was seen arriving at the 'Fabulous Thirties' themed event with friends . Ms Maloney started her speech by apologising for homophobic comments she made while standing to become London Mayor in 2004.  At the time, the high-profile promoter said she would not campaign in Camden because there were 'too many gays'. Today, Ms Maloney said: 'I have learned to say sorry and apologise if I am wrong. 'I made a terrible mistake in 2004 when I made a derogatory remark about the gay community, and to them I apologise.

"A mysterious skeleton found buried inside a lead coffin beside the remains of Richard III could belong to a revered holy woman who was said to reduce time spent in purgatory for those that prayed for her soul. Archaeologists believe the elderly woman, whose lead coffin was inlaid with a crucifix, may have been buried nearly 200 years before the last Plantagenet king of England. Her coffin was discovered within a limestone sarcophagus under a car park in Leicester city centre on what was the site of the Grey Friars church, just feet from Richard III's grave. Scroll down for videos . The lead coffin, inlaid with a crucifix (top) was found just feet from the remains of Richard III. Inside was the skeleton of a woman who is thought to have died in her 60s about 200 years before the Plantagenet king . She was one of nine women found to have been buried within the medieval complex around the hastily dug final resting place of Richard III. However, radiocarbon dating shows she may been buried not long after the church was first built 1250 - nearly two centuries before Richard III died. The blow that killed King Richard III in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull, scientists studying his remains have revealed. Forensic pathologists at University of Leicester, discovered two wounds at the base of the king's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium. The findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull. Genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton, discovered under a council car park in Leicester three years ago, has confirmed that it did belong to Richard III. Scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet. Using modern medical scanners, they established that the English monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Analysis of isotopes preserved in her remains by researchers at the University of Leicester has shown that the woman was show that she had lived a privileged life, eating plenty of protein and large amounts of sea fish. It is thought that she had died in her 60s. This suggests she had been wealthy and had been carefully buried in a prominent position under the choir of the friary and close to the high altar. This all suggests she had special significant to the Catholic order and may have been an early benefactor of the friary, archaeologists leading the excavation believe. They have found clues that suggest one of the women buried there was highly revered. Records dating back to around the time the monastery was founded, more than 700 years ago, show that the Bishop of Lincoln offered a 30 day indulgence for anyone who would pray for a woman buried beneath a Franciscan Church in Leicester. Dated to 1250, it offered a month off the pains of purgatory for anyone who would say 'a Pater and a Ave for the soul of Emma, wife of John of Holt, whose body is buried in the Franciscan church in Leicester'. However, according to Mathew Morris, lead archaeologist at Leicester University and site director for the excavation, she is thought to be from Nevill Holt in Leicestershire. However, little more is known about Emma Holt, and it was likely none of women found buried under Grey Friars will ever be completely identified. He said: 'We don't know much more about her. We know she was buried around 1290 in the friary church, but we don't know her age at death, what she did for a living or what she looked like. The lead coffin was found inside a limestone sarcophagus (above) under the choir of the Grey Friars church . Archaeologists had to carefully remove stone lid on top the coffin (above) in order to exhume the body . The lead coffin had been damaged by water around the feet (above) causing the skeleton to become damaged . 'We don't have any known descendants who can provide a DNA sample, so despite having a known woman buried here and a skeleton with a set of attributes we cannot link the two together. 'Unfortunately this skeleton will always remain anonymous.' The twisted and battled scarred skeleton of Richard III was discovered in a shallow grave beneath the site of the friary in 2012. Subsequent DNA work has positively confirmed the skeleton as belonging to the Plantagenet king. He had been buried in a crudely dug grave within the church in 1485. Further excavations on the site in August 2013, however, revealed the sarcophagus containing the mystery elderly woman. A further eight graves containing women were found around the spot where Richard III had been buried. Scientists believe their could be at least seven more graves on the site of the old Grey Friars church, which was being used as a car park when archaeologists began excavating in their search for the body of Richard III . The sarcophagus was first uncovered in 2012 at the same time as Richard III but due to bad weather archaeologists had to wait until the following year before being able to return to begin excavating the coffin . Mr Morris said: 'What stands out more is the contrast between the care and attention taken with these burials – large, neatly dug graves with coffins – and the crudeness of Richard III’s grave. 'The more we examine it, the clearer it becomes how atypical Richard III’s burial really was.' In total archaeologists exhumed three of the women found buried on the site of Grey Friars and left six undisturbed. Two graves, inside the choir, contained wooden coffins with a woman inside each aged between 40 and 50 years old. Radiocarbon dating shows that they probably died between 1270 and 1400, while osteological analysis of the bones show that one of the women had a congenital hip dislocation that would have forced her to walk with a crutch. The other woman was found to have lived a life of hard physical labour, regularly using her arms and legs to life heavy weights. The stonework of the sarcophagus had cracked and crumbled (shown above) due to the weight of the lid . Mathew Morris (above) led the excavation, which was done by hand rather than using heavy lifting machinery . Archaeologists uncovered Medieval floor tiles during the excavation that they believe would have formed the floor of the friary under which the body of Richard III and the women found on the site were buried . Another skeleton, which had been disturbed and reburied in early building work, also showed signs of hard physical work and is believed to have died in her mid-20s. However, it was the coffin found within the stone sarcophagus that has attracted most attention from archaeologists. It is the first to be found in Leicester in a modern excavation. Mr Morris said: 'The stone sarcophagus was a tapered box carved from a single block of limestone. Inside, the wider end was curved, creating a broad head niche. 'Unfortunately, the stone lid did not properly fit the coffin allowing water to get inside, and its immense weight had badly cracked the sarcophagus, meaning it could not be lifted intact. 'However, inside the inner lead coffin was undamaged except for a hole at the foot end of the casket where the lead had decayed and collapsed inward exposing the skeleton’s feet.' Initially the coffin was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary to be examined for an endoscope in case any tissue had been preserved. Mr Morris said that while the body had decayed to leave only a skeleton, fragments of cloth and hair were still intact. He said: 'Opening a lead coffin was an interesting experience. It is a little like opening a tin can. There were a few fragments of linen or cloth and cord - these might be the remains of the shroud. A little bit of hair survived as well. 'A grave like this you have go to think this person was important to the friars. We know this woman was over 60 when she died. Stable isotope analysis of her bones suggest she had a very high status diet and she was eating a lot of fish and meat. 'When you compare her diet with Richard III it is only just below his adult diet.'","Archaeologists discovered the bones of an elderly woman in a lead coffin .

"Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen will release a new cookbook titled Paula Deen Cuts The Fat . Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen has continued her recent comeback attempt with a distribution deal and a new healthy cookbook. Paula Deen Cuts The Fat will feature 200 light recipes and low-fat updates to 50 of her 'classic' dishes. The announcement came just days after Deen, 68, said she would be launching a daily radio show and a weekly podcast in May. The new cookbook, Deen's fifteenth,is being sold and distributed by Hachette Book Group. Under Deen's new distribution and multi-book deal with the publisher, Hachette will also reissue Deen's previous cookbooks in print and electronic form, according to the Los Angeles Times. Deen, who recently lost 40lb after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2013, told People Magazine the recipes included will preserve 'the same delicious southern taste' she is known for. Todd McGarity, Hachette's vice president of client distribution services, said the company was 'thrilled' to be working with Deen and her 'trademark warmth and culinary flair', which are 'appealing as ever'. 'Her large, dedicated fan base is eager for more from her,' McGarity said in a released statement. 'And we are looking forward to continuing to build on her impressive sales.' The new cookbook will be Deen's first since she was dropped from the Food Network after she admitted in court to using racial slurs. Deen was sued in 2012 by a former employee who claimed the then-beloved Southern chef and her brother had made racist remarks at their Savannah, Georgia restaurant. The new cookbook will be Deen's first since she was dropped by Food Network and a previous publisher after she was sued for making racist remarks to an employer at her restaurant and admitted to using the 'N' word . In a court deposition, she admitted to using the 'N word' and later released a video, in tears, apologizing for the incident. 'I want to learn and grow from this,' she said. 'Inappropriate and hurtful language is totally unacceptable.' 'I've made plenty of mistakes along the way but I beg you, my children, my team, my fans, my partners, I beg for your forgiveness.' Deen was then dropped by the Food Network, where she was a host for 13 years, as well as Wal-Mart and Target. She also lost a book deal with Ballantine Books.","Paula Deen Cuts The Fat will feature 200 light recipes and low-fat updates to 50 of the chef's 'classic' dishes, she said .

"Police in Ferguson are racially-biased and fuelled tensions in the city for years before Michael Brown was shot dead, a report by the Justice Department will reveal. Officers increasingly ticketed black citizens  in regular traffic stops used to boost the department's coffers, senior officials connected to the report told The New York Times. Those unable to pay the mounting fines would be repeatedly jailed, creating an 'avoidable' cycle that caused tension with the African-American community. A racist joke circulated via email among police officers will also be featured in the report, it is claimed. Scroll down for video . Condemned: A Justice Department report will accuse Ferguson police of disproportionately targeting black people . Created tensions: Their attitudes created tensions for years that led to the fatal shooting of Michael Brown on August 6, 2014, the report will say. Brown's death sparked global outrage and debates over racial equality . The findings come three months after a grand jury refused to indict officer Darren Wilson over the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown  on August 9 last year. Brown was spotted by Wilson after a robbery at a nearby convenience store. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson approached Brown because he was 'walking down the middle of the street, blocking traffic'. The 18-year-old was shot on Canfield Drive less than five minutes later. Some witnesses claim Brown had his hands up in surrender when he was shot - something that has been contested by others. The incident caused widespread protests. Businesses were looted and set fire to in Ferguson and hundreds attended demonstrations in St Louis, Washington, Oakland, Atlanta and Los Angeles. A grand jury decided not to indict Wilson on November 25 last year - but the results of the report by the Justice Department have not been expected until this week. Concern: Outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder focused the report on relations between police and citizens . Unrest: Protests were staged in Ferguson, Missouri, for months after Michael Brown's shooting . Investigators will not seek to label Ferguson police as racially motivated but will look to see if the fatal events in August last year were avoidable. Blacks accounted for 86 per cent of traffic stops in 2013 - despite the fact they only made up 63 per cent of the population, data published by the Missouri attorney general revealed. Once they were stopped they were twice as likely to be searched. The Justice Department stresses that this causes concerns surrounding the alleged violation of human rights in the city, which became the epicenter of heated debate over racial equality last year.

He tells them to move to the sidewalk . 12.01-12.04pm Wilson has given conflicting accounts of the events leading up to him shooting Brown dead. Initially he claimed not to have heard the convenience store robbery call or the description of Brown and Johnson put out following it. Later he claimed to have doubled back on the youths having realized they fitted the description . 4.00pm Brown’s body remains on the street for nearly four hours while hundreds gather to protest the shooting .

Ferguson's mayor, James Knowles III, slammed the Justice Department for criticizing the city before sharing their findings. 'How come they haven't told us there is something that needs to be changed as they found it?'  Knowles demanded at a press conference, the Times reported. 'Why have they allowed whatever they think is happening to continue to happen for six months if that's the case?'","Justice Department report due to be released later this week .

"Banks will be hit with an extra £1billion tax until the deficit has been completely cleared, under new Lib Dem proposals. The new 8 per cent levy - which effectively strips the banks of the benefit of the Government's corporation tax cuts – will form a key plank of the party's election manifesto. Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander said the tax hike will help the next Government find the £30billion of savings after the election needed to balance the books. The Lib Dem economic spokesman Danny Alexander wants to introduce a new 8 per cent levy on banks . Like the Conservatives, the Lib Dems are committed eliminating the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18. But unlike the Tories - who say they would do it through spending cuts alone - the Lib Dems say they would seek to raise at least £8 billion through extra taxes. The annual levy on banks, which was introduced in 2010, currently brings in around £2.5billion a year. Mr Alexander's proposals are expected to take that up to £3.5billion a year. A 'mansion tax' on homes worth over £2million will raise an extra £1.5billion, and a crackdown on tax avoidance could save £6billion, the Lib Dems claim. The Lib Dem economic spokesman said: 'Failings in the banking system were a major factor in the great crash of 2008. 'That's why we have always insisted that the banks help fund repairing the economy. 'To that end, we introduced the Bank Levy which is on track to raise £8billion in this Parliament. 'With the final stage of deficit reduction requiring around £30billion of savings, it would be totally wrong for all of that to be found from cuts to public services as the Conservatives propose. 'Liberal Democrats believe that we must balance the books and do so fairly, so it is only right to reconsider whether banks are making a fair contribution to deficit reduction. 'This tax would remain in place until that job is complete.' The Tories and Lib Dems are committed eliminating the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18. But the Lib Dems want to raise at least £8 billion through extra taxes, while George Osborne (pictured) insists it can be achieved through spending cuts alone . All the revenue raised from the new bank tax will go towards paying down the deficit. The Lib Dems will push for the measure to be included in the forthcoming Budget – but if the Tories resist, it will be included in the Liberal Democrat manifesto. Mr Alexander added: 'Many banks were left seriously weakened after the crash. 'But as a result of our comprehensive range of reforms, and the strong economic recovery, the banking sector is now returning to health and profitability. 'So now is the right time to ask the sector to contribute a little more to help us balance the nation's books. That's the right way to keep our strong economy on track, and build a fairer society too.' Industry group the British Banking Association criticised the proposal, saying that banks in the UK already pay more tax than any other industry. Labour's shadow treasury secretary Chris Leslie added: 'Nobody will trust what the Lib Dems say after they broke their promises on tax by raising VAT on families while giving millionaires a huge tax cut. 'Labour will introduce a tax on bank bonuses to pay for a jobs programme for young people. We'll reverse this Government's £3billion a year tax cut for the top 1 per cent of earners to help get the deficit down fairly. 'And we'll increase the bank levy, which has raised over £2billion less than the Government promised, to pay for more free childcare for working parents. The Lib Dems have joined the Tories in opposing all these fair policies.'","Banks will have to pay a new 8% annual levy until 2017/18 to clear deficit .

"The BBC must change the way it funds itself to secure its future, the director-general warns today. In a speech to staff, Tony Hall will say he backs plans to overhaul the licence fee ‘to reflect changing times’. Lord Hall reveals he is open to a new universal levy on every household in the country – even those that do not own a television set or only watch programmes online or on catch-up services. BBC director-general Tony Hall, who says he will back plans to overhaul the licence fee 'to reflect changing times' This would lead to an estimated 500,000 extra households having to pay for a service they do not use or currently get free. The director-general’s speech at Broadcasting House in London comes just a week after a report by the MPs on the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the £145.50-a-year TV licence fee system was outdated and should be replaced. The debate has stepped up a gear as negotiations on renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter in 2016 get under way. Expressing the BBC’s view, Lord Hall is expected to say: ‘We’ve always said that the licence fee should be updated to reflect changing times. ‘I welcome the committee’s endorsement of our proposal to make people pay the licence fee even if they only watch catch-up television. ‘The committee has suggested another route to modernising the licence fee – a universal household levy. Both proposals have the same goal in mind: adapting the licence fee for the internet age. Lord Hall made the speech to staff at BBC Broadcasting House, pictured, just a week after a report by the MPs on the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the £145.50-a-year TV licence fee system was outdated and should be replaced . ‘I believe we need and we will need what the licence fee – in whatever form – makes happen more than ever.’ A universal tax would remove the need for the BBC to pursue those who do not pay the licence fee – a costly system that leads to a loss of between £196million - £235million a year. But ministers say the earliest it could be introduced would be 2026. A subscription system advocated by the select committee, is opposed by Lord Hall as ‘poor value’. He will warn that it could fatally diminish the BBC’s ability to compete on digital platforms with other providers such as Netflix, Google and Apple.","BBC director-general Tony Hall made a speech at Broadcasting House .

"Waterways around the Northeast are beset by ice that is more than a foot thick in some places, making life miserable for those who make their living on the water. Scott Werner of Portland, Maine, said this winter has been 'a horror show' for lobster fishermen like himself. The ice has prevented him from getting his boat out to fish in recent weeks, and cut into his ability to make money in the already slow winter lobstering season, he said. 'I'm not going to risk it. I don't want to break anything,' Werner said. 'It's been brutal, but what are you going to do?' Scroll down for video . New lows: Portland Harbor in Maine is encountering more ice than ever thanks to the coldest February on record - several lobster boats were locked in the ice and ice breakers are needed to keep commerce flowing . Iced waterways are a problem in other Northeast locations, such as off of Boston, where a commuter ferry carrying more than 100 passengers got delayed by about 45 minutes when it was slowed down by the coastal ice pack on February 20. And in New York, where the Coast Guard is cutting ice on the Hudson River so barges carrying heating oil, gasoline and jet fuel can reach destinations. The thickest part is in the area of Germantown and Hudson, north of New York City. In some spots the ice is a foot-and-a-half thick, Coast Guard officials said. 'The barges traveling from New York City to Albany have the most difficult time transiting through that one area, so that's where the Coast Guard is devoting its effort to keep clean,' Coast Guard Lt. Ken Sauerbrunn said. Landlocked: Lobster fishing boats are locked in ice at Widgery Wharf in Portland, Maine . It was the coldest February on record in Portland according to National Weather Service records that go back to 1940. The frigid temperatures froze more than ten lobster fishing boats in ice off of Portland, said Bill Needelman, the city's waterfront coordinator. Fewer fishermen have been able to pursue key food fish such as haddock and pollock, which has cut into landings at the city's fish pier and lessened activity at the Portland Fish Exchange auction, he said. The ice also is causing damage to piers and could contribute to erosion, Needelman said. Freezing conditions: A lobsterman looks out at the icy waters while checking on the condition of his boat in Portland, Maine - Ice clings to pilings at the high-tide mark in the background . He said this year's ice likely will take a heavy toll on waterfront infrastructure in the city. 'It's a highly destructive force and we can anticipate that there will be a lot of maintenance needs and repair needs,' he said. The Coast Guard experienced an approximately two week period in February when it's ice-cutting tug, Shackle, was out cutting ice every day, Chief Warrant Officer Bob Albert said. Cutting was needed in Portland Harbor, the Fore River and parts of Casco Bay to allow for petroleum deliveries and for commuter ferries and fishing vessels to traverse the waterways, he said. 'The demand for ice breaking this year has exceeded any demands that have been placed on the Coast Guard at any time in the last ten years,' Albert said.","Scott Werner of Portland said this winter has been 'a horror show' for lobster fishermen like himself .

"A top-secret sporty new 200mph ‘baby’ Bentley fit for a 21st century James Bond broke cover tonight. The wraps came off Bentley’s stunning new two-seater Aston Martin rival on the eve of the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland. The prototype coupe will be available for an estimated £130,000 price tag when it goes on sale within three years. Scroll down for video . Bentley 'baby': The EXP 10 Speed 6 is pictured today ahead of the 85th International Motor Show in Geneva . Unveiling: Bentley CEO Wolfgang Durheimer speaks next to the EXP 10 Speed 6 at the event in Switzerland . And Bentley bosses believe the two-seater GT grand tourer is just the job to tempt 007 to ‘defect’ from his big screen affair with Aston Martin stretching over five decades and go back to his first love from the original Ian Fleming books: a Bentley. Bond’s relationship with Aston Martin dates back to the original DB5 in Goldfinger to the new DB10 in the forthcoming movie Spectre. Bentley executives have spoken over the past year about their desire to produce a new smaller but sporty ‘baby’ Bentley to take on Aston Martin, Ferrari and Maserati. It comes as Bentley also prepares to launch its first 4x4 sports utility vehicle called Bentayga. Leading motor magazine Autocar produced images of how the sleek new two-seater to be built at Crewe would look. But there was a chance tonight to see the real thing in the metal. The new car is likely to be powered initially by a specially-tweaked 500 brake-horse-power 4.0 litre twin-turbo engine introduced recently into other Bentley models. Through the smoke:The wraps came off Bentley’s stunning new two-seater Aston Martin rival today . Favourite: James Bond’s relationship with Aston Martin dates back to the original DB5 in Goldfinger to the new DB10 in the forthcoming movie Spectre. He is pictured last month with the DB10 during filming in Rome . But higher powered options are also likely to match the 200mph top speed of other cars in the Bentley range. And though already widely dubbed Bentley’s new ‘baby’, bosses stressed that it will not be a noticeably small car, despite having fewer seats and just two doors. It is set to sit alongside the existing Bentley Continental GT rather than below it, say insiders. The British-based but German-owned luxury car firm is part of the giant Volkswagen Group and employs nearly 4,000 people at Crewe. The car was the star of the packed Volkswagen Group night in Geneva which attracted hundreds of journalists and executives. Bentley sales director Kevin Rose said: ‘Emotionally for an Englishman it’s fascinatingly attractive. And we’ve got a very good Bond at the moment in Daniel Craig. Interior: Bentley executives have spoken over the past year about their desire to produce a new smaller but sporty ‘baby’ Bentley to take on Aston Martin, Ferrari and Maserati . On the road: Bentley bosses believe the two-seater GT grand tourer is just the job to tempt 007 to ‘defect’ from his big screen affair with Aston Martin stretching over five decades . ‘It would take a lot of years to get him to defect from Aston Martin. But we’re working on it. Bentley is on track to double its record sales to more than 20,000 on the back of the new 4x4 to be unveiled later this year, before going on sale next year at around £130,000. Last year Bentley sold a record 11,020 sportily luxurious limousines, coupes and cabriolets. But Bentley expects the new sports utility vehicle to increase sales to 20,000 a year by the end of the decade after hitting 15,000 deliveries by 2018 - and is already expanding its factory to cope with it and other new models. Bentley’s chief executive Wolfgang Duerheimer said last month: ‘We think the success of the SUV will lift us into a new dimension.’ He added that Bentley would remain British, even if the UK voted to leave the European Union, saying: ‘The bright future is based in Britain and in Crewe.’ Bentley said more than 4,000 potential customers have already expressed an interest in the new luxury off-roader without having seen it. He added: ’There’s a lot we could do. The idea of a fifth line is attractive. We seriously not short of ideas but a small car could be something we could do.’ ’The advantage of a smaller car is that it would enable us to have something to go up against Aston Martin or Maserati.’ However, small will not mean cheap - as prices are expected to range from £120,000 to £140,000. Regarding the forthcoming Bentayga 4x4, Mr Rose added: ‘There’s nothing to say James Bond might not drive a sports utility vehicle.’ Autocar editor-in-chief Steve Cropley said Bentley was out to ‘steal Aston Martin’s lunch’. He said: ’Bentley will unveil a super performance front-engined two-seat sports GT at the Geneva Motor Show. ‘It is a preview to a new model aimed squarely at stealing sales from Aston Martin and Ferrari.’ He noted: ‘Bentley is likely to say the car’s main purpose is to test the reaction of potential new customers.’ But Bentley’s well-established track record is to show first, then build later. Mr Cropley said: ‘The new two-seat coupe would extend Bentley’s product portfolio to five distinct models.’ In the original Ian Fleming books, Bond drove a powerful ‘blowers’ Bentley with a supercharged engine. Luxrious: Bentley codenamed its new two-seater 'baby' Exp 10 Speed 6 and said it was 'a potential future model line' Looking inside: The car was the star of the packed Volkswagen Group night in Geneva which attracted hundreds of journalists and executives . Bentley codenamed its new two-seater 'baby' Exp 10 Speed 6 and said it was 'a potential future model line'. A company spokesman said: 'The concept is a British interpretation of a high performance two-seater sports car using modern automotive design, highly skilled handcrafting, the finest materials and advanced performance technology.' Wolfgang Dürheimer, chairman and chief executive of Bentley Motors, said: 'Exp 10 Speed 6 is one vision for Bentley’s future – a powerful, exquisite and individual concept. ‘The showcar has the potential to be the new pinnacle luxury two-seat sports car. It offers thrilling, driver-oriented performance, complete with trademark modern Bentley luxury and effortlessness. ' He added: 'It could be a future model line, alongside the Continental GT and redefining the pinnacle of another market sector, and the styling of the EXP 10 Speed 6 could influence the expansion of the Bentley family. ‘This is not just a new sports car concept – but the potential Bentley sports car – a bold vision for a brand with a bold future'.","200mph coupe Exp 10 Speed 6 launched at Geneva Motor Show today .

"The sound of popping champagne corks and hushed conversations fills the small garden terrace. Fairylights twinkle in the palm trees, illuminating the frescoed ceilings of the Chateau Marmont. Beyond the tall, white walls of LA's most historic hotel - built in the Twenties - is the murmur of Hollywood, where on Sunday Eddie Redmayne's Oscar dreams came true. In the hotel restaurant, my fish comes with a sprinkling of Hollywood glamour - Eva Longoria and Richard Gere are dining. Glamour at every turn: Tourists can gain a close glimpse of the Hollywood sign with via a ranch ride . No one bats an eyelid, except me. Running into the odd A-lister - or desperate housewife - is business as usual in Hollywood, particularly in awards season. But you don't stand much chance if your Tinseltown experience is limited to the Walk of Fame and cemented handprints outside the TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Happily, there are plenty of better hotspots where you can catch up with your favourite celebs. I spy Susan Sarandon at the bar of the Sunset Tower Hotel, where Eddie Redmayne, was spotted the night before the Oscars. The following evening, I dodge the paparazzi waiting for Jessica Alba outside Craig's Restaurant in West Hollywood. I am tucking into my southern fried honey chicken when she slips out via the kitchen. The next morning, while crowds gather at a glossy shopping complex for a mediocre view of the Hollywood Sign, I venture deep into the surrounding hills to get the ultimate glimpse. Marilyn is saddled up and waiting at Sunset Ranch ahead of a morning's horse riding in the Hollywood Hills. Leading the way in cowboy hat is guide Lila, who once took the Beckhams out for a ride. 'Yes, even Victoria!' says Lila. 'She was a natural.' We make our way along some of the 56 miles of sandy trails that lace Griffith Park, one of the largest in the States and named after the 19th-century colonel who donated this land to the city. It's an unusual way to experience Hollywood, agrees Lila, as we peer down into cacti-studded canyons sheltering coyotes and rattlesnakes. Looming large on the slopes of Mount Lee is the Hollywood Sign. A part of LA's history since 1923, when it originally read 'Hollywoodland' to advertise a nearby property development, the sign hasn't always been such a happy spot. Actress Peg Entwistle committed suicide here, jumping to her death from the letter 'H' in 1932. Sunday morning in Tinseltown and there's only one place to be: the Farmer's Market on Ivar Avenue. The man in focus: Eddie Redmayne (pictured with wife Hannah) was the big winner at this year's Oscars . Between 8am and 1pm, the streets between Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards are closed to traffic as hundreds of food and handicraft stalls are set up. This is where local foodies - including Cameron Diaz and Claire Danes - come to pick up their groceries. Just up the road is the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, a glorious Spanish-inspired property that's earned its place in history. Not just as the birthplace of the Oscars - the first ceremony took place in the Blossom Ballroom in 1929 - but for the showbiz royalty that have stayed and played here. Shirley Temple learnt to tap dance on the tiled staircase in the lobby and regular guest Marilyn Monroe (she preferred room 246) loved the place so much that she still visits. Her ghost is said to haunt the hotel. And you can't get much more Hollywood than that. British Airways (0844 493 0758, www.ba.com) flies to LA from £573 return.

"Boys from Knox Grammar roared with approval when their headmaster touched a young girl who was taking part in a school musical, an inquiry has heard. Lucy Perry, who now heads an international women's health charity, told the child abuse royal commission she was indecently assaulted by the elite Sydney boys school's former headmaster Ian Paterson in 1989 when she was 15. Ms Perry, chief executive of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia (Australia), said the assault happened in full view of students at the Knox school hall and the boys who saw it 'roared with approval'. Scroll down for video . Former Roseville College student Lucy Perry gave evidence on Monday to the royal commission into child sex abuse . The CEO was surprised by the reaction she caused inside the inquiry, with victims standing up and applauding her as she left . She reported the assault to NSW police in 2009 when allegations about sexual abuse at Knox were emerging. Ms Perry's school, Roseville College, and Knox Grammar had been jointly staging the musical 'Guys and Dolls'. During one rehearsal, Dr Paterson, who the show's producer, singled her out, the commission heard on Monday. As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. Ms Perry, who heads Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia, told the commission former headmaster Ian Paterson groped her . 'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission. 'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and [I] felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering. 'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.' The now 41-year-old , who was in her teens at the time of the 1989 incident, said students cheered when he touched her bottom and genitals . Ms Perry, now 41, was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009. 'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said. Dr Paterson's solicitor Jim Harrowell asked her if the headmaster was just positioning her on the stage. 'I would suggest to you Mr Harrowell that positioning girls by their bottoms is not the best way to do that,' she said. The chief executive was applauded by Knox victims and their supporters as she left the hearing in Sydney . Ms Perry was applauded by Knox victims and their supporters as she left the hearing in Sydney. Later she tweeted: 'I did not expect a standing ovation when I walked out of the Royal Commission today. Survivors are much braver than me.' Earlier on Monday, David Lloyd, counsel assisting the commission, said there was no evidence to support an allegation made during evidence on Friday that the Uniting Church's former moderator James Mein and solicitor Rob Wannan, who was the former chair of the Knox council, were involved in the destruction of sensitive documents. Mr Lloyd does not intend to recommend a finding they were involved. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse inquiry into Knox continues on Tuesday.

"A British backpacker who wrote a romantic note to locate a handsome stranger after spotting him on a New Zealand beach has finally met her Romeo for the first time. Sarah Milne, from Glasgow, left a handmade poster for the man, who she saw in Picton on Friday and described as 'shirtless, wearing black shorts with stars tattooed on his torso and running with a curly, bouncy and blonde dog'. In her note, entitled 'Is this you?', she invited the mystery stranger to meet her on the same beach  on Tuesday. But the message soon became a source of huge online interest with the identity of both the author and its intended target generating unexpected publicity. Then on Tuesday at 2pm, in front of a gathering crowd waiting to see the two finally introduce themselves, William Scott Chalmers came forward to meet the note's author, Milne, an artist, on the picturesque foreshore. Milne, who is originally from the west coast of Scotland, studied at Glasgow School of Arts before backpacking in New Zealand where she will stay for another two months. She said that she had not been expecting the hype surrounding her handwritten note. Scroll down for video . Love at first sight? Sarah Milne, a backpacker from Scotland, meets William Chalmers, after her note brought them together . They finally meet: Mr Chalmers met Milne just after 2pm and asked if she wanted to go somewhere quiet and have a drink . Love note: The handmade message Milne used to launch a public appeal to find a  man after a brief encounter on Friday . Mr Chalmers, who brought a bottle of champagne with him, walked over to where Milne was sitting and said 'Hello, I'm William, you know you could have just asked for my number.' 'Let's go somewhere and have a drink away from everyone,' he told her, as the crowd watching their date clapped and cheered. Mr Chalmers came forward on Sunday morning to reveal himself as the mystery man, and told Daily Mail Australia that he planned on heading down to the picturesque spot to ask his brunette admirer on a date for the evening. The New Zealander, who works at a local burger joint, said that he first heard of the poster when his housemate came home at 3am on Saturday night and woke him up. 'He was carrying on and telling me about a poster that two German girls had told him about that described me,' he said. 'He knew it was me because I'm the only guy in Picton who has star tattoos, Johnny-Bravo hair and a labradoodle.' Mr Chalmers said he and his housemate drove down to the shore in the dark to try and find the note, and that even when he saw it for himself, he had a hard time believing it was real. Milne was greeted at the picturesque meeting spot with great fanfare after their story had generated huge publicity . The Glasgow artist was greeted as she stepped off her ferry to a sign that said 'Here's to a happy ending'. 'Of course I'm going down. But just going up to her and asking to chat is a bit out of the question with all the attention, so I'm just going to have to skip a step and ask if she wants to have dinner tonight,' Mr Chalmers told Daily Mail Australia. 'I finish work at 2pm and I'll see if she wants to have dinner or a drink at maybe seven. 'I'm not sure if the poor girl knows what she's gotten herself into. It's just gotten so big, I've gotten messages from friends overseas saying that they've read the story.' The poster in question was tied to a pole down at the shorefront and was also posted on Beachcomber Fun Cruises Facebook page on Saturday. 'I was sitting on the grass on Friday watching the sea... you were playing with your dog. You ran past me and smiled,' it said. 'Would you like to go for a drink/coffee/walk??? I'm in Wellington just now, my ferry arrives back in Picton on Tuesday 3rd. 'I'm in town for 1 night only... But let's see how things go... On the off-chance you are single, remember who I am and would like to meet for a drink/coffee/walk. Mr Chalmers has revealed himself as the mystery man who captured the heart of the mystery woman . He said he was looking forward to Tuesday and meeting his mystery girl . 'I'll be sitting on the grass, watching the sea from 1-1.30pm onwards on Tuesday... Maybe you'll run past again?!?' Mr Chalmers said his mother had called him because she had been told of the sign and thought it was such a coincidence that the man described in the sign had star tattoos as well. 'When I told her that it was me, she started freaking out and telling everyone in the office,' he said. 'She's all for me going down. She told me that she didn't raise me to not show up, so that's what I'm going to do. 'It's a bit overwhelming, I've never had something like this happen before. In high school if you passed a note the teacher would just take it off you.' Mr Chalmers said while he did not know who the woman was, he remembered smiling at a particular woman that day on the beach. 'It's all a bit exciting, it's going to be a big day,' he said. The signs were posted on Beachcomber Fun Cruises Facebook page  and has sparked an online debate . 'Picton is a pretty small town and from the amount of people who have told me they're going to come down and watch what happens it sounds like everyone I know will be there.' Milne may have had some inkling of the stir the note has caused, pleading with the public to not have the sign removed from the premises. 'In the spirit of happy endings, give this sign a chance to be seen by the right eyes,' she penned. 'It may even bring a dozen or so people back on Tuesday, intrigued... who is this girl with the long brown hair and the boy with the star tattoos and the dog and will they meet for a drink? 'I will, on my return to Picton on Tuesday, remove it myself... Whatever the ending may be. Thank you!' Mr Chalmers promised he would keep the fascinated followers of the real-life fairytale up to date with the outcome of their evening.","Sarah Milne, a Glasgow artist, launched a public appeal to find the mystery man .

"A seven-year-old boy suffered a deep wound above his eye after he was mauled by a Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross he was trying to cuddle. McKinley Worthington was bitten by the dog during a family day out at a pub near his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester last April. CCTV footage shown to Bolton Magistrates' Court shows the schoolboy being licked by the landlady's dog before it turns and bites him as he leans in for a cuddle. Mauled: McKinley Worthington, right with his father, Aaron, was bitten by the dog during a family day out at a pub near his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester last April. Left, the boy was left with a wound above his eye . Family day out: McKinley was with his sister, Maisie and parents Sammi-Jo and Aaron, pictured together . The dog's owner, Margaret Wilson, who runs the Oddfellows Arms in Bolton, Greater Manchester was convicted of having a dog dangerously out of control last week. She was fined £200 and ordered to pay £520 in costs, but her dog, named Caine, will not be destroyed. Instead it must wear a muzzle in public places and in the pub area at all times. McKinley's mother, Sammi-Jo Gledhill, said after the hearing that her son started screaming 'I am going to die' as blood poured from the wound above his eye. He was taken to hospital where he was given eight stitches - leaving him with a scar above his eye. McKinley is now petrified of dogs and tells his mother he looks 'ugly' because of the scarring. He also refuses to leave the house without his cap on. McKinley and his three-year-old sister, Maisie, had been taken to the pub with their mother and father, where the dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback cross, was allowed to walk around freely. Margaret Wilson, pictured last week outside court, was convicted of having a dog dangerously out of control. Right, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier-Rhodesian Ridgeback crossbreed like the one that attacked McKinley . Footage taken from a security camera shows McKinley on his knees trying to get the dog to play with him at around 7pm - seven hours after the family arrived at the pub. Initially the dog is seen licking McKinley's face, but then bites the schoolboy when he leaned in for a cuddle. Witness Trevor Oliphant said: 'When the little lad came in the dog went to his bed. The wee lad went to follow him and I said ""I think he is tired"". It appeared the dog didn't want to play with him.' Wilson denied wrongdoing claiming the boy's injuries were caused accidentally. McKinley was taken to hospital where he was given eight stitches, leaving him with a scar above his eye . She said her dog had always been allowed downstairs in the pub and had never had a problem with the animal previously. She said she was aware of Miss Gledhill and her children in the pub but 'hadn't felt the need' to take Caine upstairs and 'had no worries about him at all'. She told police that she had earlier told the boy to stop bothering the dog who was 'always downstairs just trotting around, lying down'. She added: 'I allow children in my pub because I have six children of my own and 15 grandchildren. I have always said that other children can come in if they are supervised. 'I have had Christmas and Halloween parties in my pub with 20-plus children with no problem. As an animal he is very laid back. He gets bullied by my cat. 'As a general rule if people say ""I'm not playing"" he goes away. Mckinley did go up to him a few times. I had asked him to leave the dog alone - he is not a toy.' But Miss Gledhill, who has since been barred from the pub, told the court: 'I had seen McKinley go up to the dog a few times but it doesn't give the dog the right to bite my son. 'There was a big gash to McKinley's eye and around dogs now he is petrified. When he sees his scar he says he looks ugly. He won't leave the house without a cap on. ' After the hearing she added: 'When it happened at first, I thought a pool ball had hit him in his face. It was all a blur but I wasn't drinking. 'The kids were always within eyesight as the pub is open and their dad was there and all our friends. There are loads of kids there. Attack: CCTV footage from The Oddfellows Arms, pictured, shown to Bolton Magistrates' Court, shows the schoolboy being licked by the landlady's dog before it turns and bites him as he leans in for a cuddle . 'When it happened Mckinley kept saying ""I'm going to die, I'm going to die"". He was braver than I would have been. 'Skin was hanging down and I could see lots of white bits which I guess was his tissue. He was screaming. 'I tried to clean him up and then the ambulance said to put a dry towel on it. In the ambulance I was in shock. He was just covered in blood. 'In hospital the doctor said that if the dog had bitten him a couple of millimetres lower, McKinley could have been blinded. 'He was very lucky. It's heartbreaking when he says he is ugly because of the scars. I feel like crying. 'After it happened we had to get rid of our Jack Russell Rex who was a puppy we'd got at Christmas because McKinley was petrified of dogs. 'Now he is very conscious of his face and he says that his scar can itch and hurt. When I saw the CCTV of the incident I started crying. 'I do understand it is her pet but you don't know with dogs - they can just turn. Another kid could bend down and it could react the same. It could have happened to any kid.' Father Aaron, 32, said: 'I know it's a pub but it's a family pub and there's always lots of kids in there - and I want the dog to be destroyed for what it did to my son.

"Outspoken actress Miriam Margolyes has made a very short and sharp comment to express her dislike for Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The English performer, who divides her time between the U.K. and Australia, did not hold back when asked what she thought of the man in the country's top job by an audience member on the ABC TV show Q&A. Famous for her no-nonsense manner, the 73-year-old Harry Potter star bluntly replied with: 'I think he's a tit'. Scroll down for video . Actress Miriam Margolyes (right) called Tony Abbott (left) a 'tit' on the ABC TV show Q&A . Twitter lit up with nothing but praise for Margolyes' bold remark with one suggesting she become the next PM . The woman prefaced the question by pointing out that Margolyes had previously described former Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard as fascinating - and that she even went as far to say that Bob Hawke, another former Labor Prime Minister, was 'just ravishing'. The woman then asked if the actress had a similar opinion of the current leader which caused the studio to erupt into laughter. Following Margolyes' comment, which is a word commonly used as an insult in Britain, she remained unusually quiet when fellow panel members had their say. Editor-in-chief of Mamamia. Jamila Rizvi, was the first to chime in with 'I think you're supposed to say ten points to Hufflepuff' - making a reference to Harry Potter in which the actress stars in one of the movies as Professor Sprout. The show's host, Tony Jones, then asked Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to describe his boss in just one word and then suggested that some of his colleagues describe him as 'doomed'. Twitter followers are impressed with how Margolyes isn't afraid to say what she thinks . Mr Frydenberg was quick to respond that Mr Abbott was 'decent' and then felt the need to elaborate because he felt he was a minority with that particular view in the room. 'This is a guy who well before he ventured into politics was a hard-working member of his local community as an SES volunteer, as a surf lifesaver,' he said. 'He doesn't go out and do that stuff with a camera in tow - he's a father of three beautiful girls, he's a happily married husband and he's and he's hard worker in this top job.' Ms Rizvi then replied that the first word that came to her mind when she thought of Mr Abbott was: 'time-limited ....with a hyphen'. While Trisha Jha, from the Centre for Independent Studies, chose to stay out of the slinging match. 'I only have one thing to say and that is the tit is a lovely bird,' she said. Meanwhile, Twitter lit up with nothing but praise for Margolyes' bold remark. #Miriam Margolyes is aaaaawwwssssoooommmmm #qanda Finally someone not fearful to sy real facts,' Abby Saleh posted. 'Great work #Miriam Margolyes say it how it is! Love ya work!' Lisa Turner said. While another user was impressed that a Harry Potter reference got a mention on the show.

"Mountain bikers and cross-country runners are at risk from the deadly stomach bug E.coli  if they get splashed with mud, doctors warned today. Medics at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary say they treated a 23-year-old cyclist for an E.coli 0157 infection after he was admitted to the hospital suffering from vomiting, abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. The man - a vegetarian - said he had not eaten undercooked meat or vegetables, nor had he spent time with livestock or visiting farms before falling ill. A man was treated for E. coli which doctors believe he contracted after taking part in a Tough Mudder event and was splashed with infected mud (file picture) But eight days before his symptoms began the man had competed in a cycling event along wet, muddy tracks in eastern Scotland. He, along with other competitors, had removed the mudguards from his bicycle to reduce weight, and mud and water had splashed on his face during the race. It is thought this was how he became infected with the bug, which can be found in animal faeces and farm slurry. The man said he had taken part in a 'Tough Mudder' event, which involves a 10 -12 mile race with obstacles such as climbing vertical walls and plunging through ice pools. The cyclist, who has not been identified, recovered - but the doctors have highlighted his case in the Journal of Infection Prevention. Writing in the research paper, the doctors warned: 'Sporting endeavours such as cycling and cross-country running events often take participants through such high-risk areas and may be an important cause of contact with E. coli 0157. 'This case highlights such exposure and should alert clinicians to the possibility of E.coli 0157 infection and the importance of individuals presenting with bloody diarrhoea with a history of participation in similar sporting or other events.' Escherichia coli, often known as E. coli, are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals, including humans. Most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness. Most cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk. The incubation period for food poisoning caused by E. coli is usually 3-4 days, but it's possible for symptoms to take longer to appear (up to two weeks). Source: NHS Choices . Dr Robert Laing, consultant physician in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and co-author of the journal article, said: 'We know that E.coli 0157 survives well in cattle faeces. 'This case highlights the possible risk to participants in sports that expose them to mud that may have been contaminated by animal faeces. 'Splashes to the face are likely to be particularly hazardous and efforts should be made to protect yourself from these as far as possible.' E.coli 0157, which lives in the gut of animals, is usually associated with food poisoning or drinking contaminated water. Scotland has a particularly high incidence of the strain, with more than twice as many cases than other parts of the UK. In 2012, three people contracted E.coli 0157 infection following a 12-mile 'Tough Mudder' event at Drumlanrig Castle, Dumfriesshire, which involved immersion or contact with mud. Also in 2012, a study of one of the world's largest mountain bike races, the 95k Birkebeinerrittet in Norway, which annually attracts 19,000 participants, found that when mudguards were attached to bikes, there were fewer cases of gastrointestinal illness. Health Protection Scotland warned anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling and  crossing areas that might contain animal faeces are at risk of picking up E.Coli (pictured in a petri dish) A Health Protection Scotland spokesman said today: 'Anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling - and events that cross areas that have recently been occupied by animals such as cattle or sheep - should be aware of the risks of picking up a gastro-intestinal infection such as Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC), more commonly referred to as E.coli. 'One of the main risks to humans is from coming into contact directly or indirectly with contaminated animal faeces. 'Our advice would be to follow common sense principles and if you have contaminated hands or face, take care that this material does not get into your mouth and wash as soon as possible and before eating.'","Doctors treated 23-year-old cyclist suffering vomiting and bloody diarrhoea .

"The bond between a mother and her children is supposed to be unbreakable, but Pauline Bubb's kids turned her into a prisoner in her own home. The 47 year old single mum from Southampton, was beaten up to 30 times a day by her daughter Sapphire, nine, and regularly locked herself away in her bedroom to escape from harm. Her son Spencer, 11,who often joined in with the abuse, was the first to violently abuse his mother - aged four, he stabbed her in the stomach with a pair of scissors. Scroll down for video . Pauline Bubb, 46, from Southampton, who was violently attacked by her 11 year-old-son Spencer, and nine-year-old daughter Sapphire (Pictured from left: Sapphire, Pauline, Spencer and Jorja) The only one of her children who didn't resort to violence was Sapphire's twin sister Jorja, who would often leave the room when the beatings started. Unable to cope, Pauline turned to Channel 5 as a last ditch attempt after hearing about their new programme, My Violent Child. In an interview with the Mirror today, she said: 'I was frightened of my own kids - my legs would often be bruised and I had to keep them covered.' The violence got so bad that Pauline started to dread her children coming home from school and would start shaking as the clock started to move towards 3.30pm. Pauline sought help from the makers of a Channel 5 documentary My Violent Child after years of violence at home at the hands of her children . The aggression would often start as soon as they walked through the front door, with the attacks escalating to the stage where Sapphire once bit her face. In one incident, Spencer attempted to strangle his mother from behind while she was sat in a chair. But while Spencer's behaviour calmed down once he was diagnosed with ADHD, Sapphire's continued to  worsen. Pauline said: 'She started off two years ago with controlling behaviour - she would ask me a question like, 'Can I have a packet of crisps?' but then say 'Yes Sapphire'. 'Then I had to say it, but exactly how she wanted me to. I couldn't say it too fast or too slow, I had to stand still, I couldn't move, I couldn't blink and she would repeat herself 20 or 30 times. 'If I said no, she would get louder, start swearing and hit me.' Pauline comforts her daughter Sapphire after one of her tantrums . Although many people would find it incredulous that Pauline allowed the abuse to escalate over a number of years without getting any help, she explains that she was too embarrassed to do anything about the situation. Pauline isn't alone - the number of violent young children in the UK is rising steadily, with 118 boys and girls under the age of 14 prosecuted for domestic abuse in 2012/13. After contacting the makers of My Violent Child, Pauline and her children started working with parenting experts provided by the television station and Pauline says she has seen a dramatic improvement in their behaviour. Pauline regularly locked herself away on her bedroom to escape the attacks . She now puts their aggression down to the fact that there were few rules in her household for the children to abide by, leaving them feeling insecure. She told The Mirror: 'I was inconsistent. I had no boundaries and had lost my parental control.' My Violent Child is on Channel 5 this Wednesday at 9pm.","Pauline Bubb, 47, from Southampton was attacked daily by her children .

"A pair of conjoined baby boys are expected to make a full recovery after being successfully separated in a nine-hour operation in Saudi Arabia. A team of surgeons, led by the country's former Health Minister Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, completed the difficult procedure in Riyadh. Both of the babies, named Abdullah and Abdulrahman, are reportedly doing very well. Scroll down for video . Abdullah and Abdulrahman, pictured before surgery, were successfully separated in a nine-hour operation . Both twins (pictured, one of the boys after separation) are reportedly doing well after the operation at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh . The twins, who are from the Republic of Yemen, were taken to Saudi Arabia to be operated on at the King Abdulaziz Medical City in the capital. During preliminary tests, the medical team discovered that the twins shared organs, including the intestines. A hospital spokesman said the multi-disciplinary medical team separated the pair after a nine-hour surgery carried out in nine stages at the weekend. He said: 'The bowels needed to be separated as well as their urinary systems and then the pelvic bones. 'When they were separated they were then divided into two teams to reconstruct the twins.' The twins shared organs, including the intestines, and pelvic bones. Pictured, Abdulrahman in recovery . A team of surgeons, led by Saudi Arabia's former Health Minister, completed the procedure over the weekend . The team had originally given the boys a 60 to 70 per cent chance of survival, but those odds have improved . The team consisted of Dr. Al-Rabeeah, Saudi consultants in anaesthesiology, paediatric, orthopaedic, plastic surgery and urinary tract surgery as well as nursing and technical staff. The surgeons originally gave the twins a 60 to 70 per cent chance of survival, but say that has now significantly improved with both are expected to survive the operation. They are currently being cared for in the paediatric intensive care unit at the hospital. This separation is the 35th performed on Siamese twins in the kingdom since 1990 on cases from more than 18 countries, including the Sudan, Yemen, Egypt, Malaysia, Philippines, Poland, Morocco and Iraq. Saudi Arabia has a team of top surgeons in the separation of conjoined twins - with 30 successful cases 30 over the past two decades.

Last week, ten-month-old conjoined baby girls, from Texas, survived a world-first operation to separate them. Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata shared the same chest wall, lungs, pericardial sac (the lining of the heart), diaphragm, liver, intestines, colon and pelvis. A team of more than 26 clinicians, including 12 surgeons, six anesthesiologists and eight surgical nurses at the Texas Children's Hospital operated to separate the girls.

"The Metropolitan Police has produced a 'need to know guide' on how to write an e-mail. The 10-point list, which has been given to its 31,000 officers, offers advice on how not to 'prattle on' when  writing and sending messages. Published in the latest edition of staff magazine The Job, the guidelines urge officers to 'write as they would speak' to avoid emails becoming too long and full of buzzwords. Top tips: The advice was published in the latest edition of Metropolitan Police staff magazine The Job, above . Some of the advice offered appears obvious, such as 'check your email for mistakes before you send it' or 'give your email a subject title that explains what it's about'. There are also tips on how to make emails more concise. Officers are encouraged to 'use-subheadings to break up the text' if their message is more than one screen in length. Including additional information via a link to another website rather than in the email itself is another helpful hint given to staff. If officers are writing to a large group of people, the list suggests 'putting the names in the ""bcc"" box to save space when the email is read or printed. The guide is published on the last page of the February/March edition of The Job under the head 'Put it simply'. The article reads: 'Many of you frequently say that the emails we share inside the Met are too long and full of 'management speak. 'Don't prattle on': One of the tips given to officers. Above, the Metropolitan Police's London headquarters . 'If someone has to decipher what you've written, they probably won't bother to read it. 'But if you can get your message across simply and clearly, they are more likely to respond'. An orange box at the bottom of the page contains the 10 tips to help officers achieve this. But not all officers think that the advice is necessary, according to The Times. A Met Police source told the newspaper: 'Most officers are either young enough to have been taught all about email at school or are old enough to have figured it out in the past 20 years or so. 'This guide might be helpful to someone who has just beamed down from outer space, but for most of the world it is like teaching your grandma to suck eggs. 'Who knows what's next? Perhaps a guide to tying shoelaces'. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police told MailOnline: 'Like many other organisations, we encourage people to use plain English as standard practise. 'It was just a quick corporate communications reminder.' 1. Give your email a subject title that explains simply and clearly what it's about; never leave the subject field blank. 2. To help people prioritise, include the words 'For action by [date] or 'For information'. 3. Write as you would speak - the words we use every day are words people can easily understand. 4. Start your email with a summary sentence that provides a quick view of why it was sent, for example, 'This email explains a new initiative and how you can take part.' 5. Be as concise as possible. 6. Rather than include lots of information in the email or in an attachment, link to information online and embed the link behind a word. If you have to include an attachment, save it as a PDF before sending. 7. If your email is more than one screen in length, use sub-headings to break up the text. You could also include a short contents list at the start. 8. Avoid forwarding the entire trail of previous emails unlesss it's essential that people see the history. 9. If you're emailing a large group of people, consider putting the names in the 'bcc' box to save space when the email is read or printed. 10.

"Blackout: The range is fully encrypted by default and comes with secure features that let you make calls and send texts that are impossible to track . If you’re fed up of apps asking to access your private data and don’t want advertisers tracking your every move, there is now a range of ‘spy’ phones designed to keep you off the grid. The original Blackphone was unveiled last year and its successor - the Blackphone 2 - as well as the first ever Blacktablet have been announced at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The range is fully encrypted by default and comes with a suite of secure features that let you make calls and send texts that are impossible to eavesdrop on or track. Blackphone’s Android-based devices are built by Spanish manufacturer GeeksPhone alongside security experts Silent Circle and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). They launched the original handset at last year’s Mobile World Congress and told MailOnline that the range is for people who ‘want to stay private without compromising on the features seen on typical Android phones.’ Everything from the custom-built PrivatOS to web browsing and apps, are encrypted, or have been fitted with an extra layer of security. PrivatOS is a so-called ‘skin’ that runs on top of traditional Android software, meaning all Android apps are compatible. The encryption on the Blackphone, Blackphone 2 and tablet is done via the Silent Circle and SpiderOak privacy and security software. Subscriptions are included for two years with each device, and they can then be renewed. As the firm explained: ‘There is no bloatware, no hooks to carriers, and no leaky data. ‘It puts privacy in the hands of you and your [business], without any sacrifices.’ For the Blackphone 2, this software has been upgraded to version 1.1, designed to separate work apps from personal ones through the use of multiple profiles on the same device. If the phone is locked, a business can remotely lock and wipe just the enterprise profile while letting the owner take control of the private profile. Internet access is carried out through a virtual private network (VPN) that sends and receives data in a way designed to keep it hidden. When the phone boots up, it asks for a password and PIN before a wizard guides users through the security options. Upgrade: Blackphone’s Android-based devices are built by Spanish manufacturer GeeksPhone alongside security experts Silent Circle and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) (handset specs shown) For example, this shows users which apps want access to which data. The Blackphone owner can then decide to restrict access to that information and handpick the apps and the data they share. Mike Kershaw, chief architect from Blackphone told MailOnline the range was designed to have ‘the benefit of security without having to have an in-depth knowledge of how to make a phone secure.’ The company said it is 'anti-personal data from the ground up’ and added the phone will appeal to those who don't want any data collection, those who agree with principle of collecting data and businessmen.

The Blackphone 2 is larger than the original with a screen size of 5.5-inches compared to last year’s 4.7-inch. A 13MP camera has been added to the rear, up from 8MP, and a 5MP is now on the front. The Blackphone 2 has doubled the storage of its predecessor and added a longer battery life - although the firm didn’t give specifics. It will go on sale by June this year, although price details were not announced. Last year’s phone cost $629 (£376) plus shipping and the updated version is likely to cost roughly the same amount. Silent Circle subscriptions start at $12.95 (£8.40) a month for 100 Silent World Minutes in 120 destinations, up to $39.95 (£26) for 1,000 minutes. But this is included in the price of the phone or tablet. Private: The company said it is 'anti-personal data from the ground up’ and added the phone will appeal to those who don't want any data collection (original Blackphone model pictured) The firm didn’t reveal much more information about the new flagship tablet, other than it will go on sale later this year. A spokesperson said it decided to launch a tablet because many people don’t want to give up their everyday phone, but still want to have a certain level of privacy. ‘Public awareness of the erosion of privacy has never been higher,’ Phil Zimmermann, co-founder of Silent Circle told MailOnline at this year’s event in Barcelona. ‘There is a rising tide of news reports of the catastrophic loss of privacy, take Sony Pictures or the Gemalto hack of sim keys in recent weeks. There are almost daily incidents of company’s who’ve had their company data leaked. ‘Never before have people been aware of the excesses of pervasive surveillance from major governments.’ Silent Suite is the Blackphone’s core set of app that encrypts calls, texts and other communication to keep it private. It is available on PrivatOS but can also be installed on iOS and Android. Silent Circle subscriptions start at $12.95 (£8.40) a month for 100 Silent World Minutes to 120 destinations, up to $39.95 (£26) for 1,000 minutes. Features include: . Silent Phone: This lets users make private voice and video calls in HD clarity over a peer to-peer encrypted VoIP service. Silent Text: Share unlimited encrypted texts and transfer files. Includes Burn functionality to destroy selected messages automatically. Silent Contacts: Safeguards personal and business contacts by automatically encrypting the address book. Silent Store: Installed on all Blackphone devices, the privacy-focused app store features apps from the developers vetted by Silent Circle. Silent World: Silent World is an encrypted calling plan that lets users communicate privately with those who don't have Silent Phone. Silent Manager: Silent Manager gives businesses a way to privately manage plans, users and devices with ease. ‘A lot of android phones are tied into Google who want to learn a lot about what you do. ‘So there are a lot of things that you do that help them track your behaviours, but on the other hand they give you features for that. ‘Or take another example, Facebook. People love the features on Facebook – but people give up their privacy in order to benefit from the features. That’s built into Facebook’s business model. If you’re not paying for the product, you are the product.’ Although the company touts the benefits of the device there is the possibility handsets such as Blackphone will be used by criminals to hide their activity. Addressing these concerns, Mr Zimmermann said: ‘Bonnie and Clyde, the famous bank robbers, almost a hundred years ago, revolutionised bank robbery by using cars to get away from the scene of the crime. ‘Police floated the idea that cars should be required to have smaller petrol tanks. Any new technology can be used by criminals to make their criminal activity work better for them.’ Blackphone’s managing director, Toby Weir-Jones told MailOnline: ‘The availability of a tool does not create the intent for mischief. 'If you’re a bad guy, the fact [Blackphone] is making cryptography usable doesn’t mean you’re going to take that a step further; you're not going to become bad because of that knowledge either.’","Original Blackphone launched at last year’s Mobile World Congress .

"Newly released statistics has shown which EU countries benefited most from illegal activities being included in the GDP. Italy saw its 2010 GDP jump by one per cent, the biggest boost to any economy in the European Union, when including 'estimated illegal activities'. Italy's increase thanks to drugs and prostitution was five times the average 0.2 per cent for the OECD as a whole. Boost: Italy's 2010 GDP increased by a full one per cent when including 'estimated illegal activities' such as sales of drugs and prostitution -  five times the average 0.2 per cent for the OECD as a whole . In contrast, the inclusion of 'Research & Development' in GDP saw a four per cent boost for Sweden and Finland, but only a 1.3 per cent increase in Italy - a marginally bigger impact that prostitution. Spain is hot on Italy's heels with a 0.9 per cent jump when including money generated by drug trafficking, prostitution, smuggling and illegal gambling. Last year, the calculation of GDP was changed to include Class A drugs trade and the ‘provision of prostitution services’. A revision to the 2010 GDP carried out by Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel shows that the two southern European nations were the ones to benefit the most from the inclusion of illegal activities. Last year, Spain's National Statistics Institute reported that money generated by drug trafficking, prostitution, smuggling and illegal gambling contributed some 9billion euros (£7billion) to the national economy last year . Contrast: The inclusion of 'Research & Development' in GDP saw a four per cent boost for Sweden and Finland, but only a 1.3 per cent increase in Italy - a marginally bigger impact that prostitution . The figures are being included in GDP calculations on the recommendation of the European Union, which is trying to harmonize estimates across member states and get a full picture of economic activity, whether legal or not. The darker corners of the economy are now being measured - alongside traditional sectors such as farming and financial services - as part of an overhaul in the way economic activity is calculated. The GDP covers every sector - from manufacturing and construction to agriculture, public services and tourism. It now also covers the import, production and sale of illegal drugs and the ‘provision of prostitution services’. The data classes growing drugs or importing them as ‘production’, buying them for home use as ‘expenditure’ and selling them as ‘income’. It covers crack cocaine, powder cocaine, heroin, cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamines.","Italy's GDP up by one per cent when including 'estimated illegal activities'

"After a teammate's knee put a dent in his face during a game against the Portland Trailblazers two days ago, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook had successful facial surgery today. The surgery repaired a fracture to the zygomatic arch of the NBA star's right cheek. Westbrook, who is averaging 26.5 points, 8.1 assists and 6.8 rebounds in 45 games this season, is not expected to be sidelined for long. Scroll down for video . Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook (above) had successful facial surgery today in Los Angeles . The surgery repaired a fracture to the zygomatic arch bone of the popular NBA star's right cheek . Westbrook was injured when teammate Andre Roberson ran into him on Friday night in Portland (pictured) The 26-year-old sustained the facial injury when his teammate Andre Roberson ran into him while trying to find a Portland player to foul and stop the clock. There were two-and-a-half seconds remaining  when Roberson kneed Westbrook in the face and the Thunder went on to lose 115-112. His surgery was performed by doctors at the Osborne Head and Neck Institute in Los Angeles, California. The zygomatic arch bone separates the eye socket from the sinuses, according to ESPN. The zygomatic arch bone separates the eye socket from the sinuses. A medical expert said the surgery was needed because 'there are bacteria in the sinuses, so it is a bone that needs to be fixed' Westbrook, 26, is averaging 26.5 points, 8.1 assists and 6.8 rebounds in 45 games for OKC this season . Medical analyst Mark Edickes said: 'There are bacteria in the sinuses, so it is a bone that needs to be fixed. 'There are a lot of facial bones you may crack that don't need to be fixed. 'The other thing is, it provides some contour to the cheek, so there is an issue of appearance as well.' When he resumes playing, Westbrook will probably wear a face mask. Westbrook did not play in OKC's 108-101 win over the Los Angeles Lakers earlier today. He will be  re-evaluated this week to determine when he can return to the court, although Yahoo Sports reported if Westbrook 'had a playoff game, he could play'. Westbrook has recorded three straight triple-doubles. DJ Augustin started in place of Westbrook against the Lakers.","Surgery fixed fracture to zygomatic arch of OKC Thunder guard's  cheek .

"The Delphina Valle dell'Erica resort in Sardinia is huge. Even the name is on the big side and when I looked at its website I had misgivings, not least because I have stayed in so many unwieldy hotels around the world that I always long for something small and personal. I had visions of elbowing fellow holidaymakers at the breakfast buffet and setting the alarm to grab a sun lounger that might actually face the sun. Mum's the word: Jodie and her son Indio enjoyed their first trip to Sardinia . What's more, this was to be an important holiday for my three-year-old son, Indio, and neither of us had been to this Italian island before. But, from the moment we set foot in the 28-hectare resort near Santa Teresa Gallura, I realised my worries were entirely misplaced. Frankly, we were bowled over. Yes, it is big - in fact it is really two hotels joined together - but it never felt big and there were days when we hardly saw a soul. It helps, of course, that there are five or six different beaches to choose from, four swimming pools (three with salt water), five restaurants, five bars, a mini football pitch and golf course. Our room faced the sea. On clear days we could see Corsica looming over the Strait of Bonifacio and every evening we were treated to spectacular sunsets. Whoever designed this place should take a bow. There were children's areas, adults-only areas, family areas and ones where no one seemed to go at all. Everywhere there was an abundance of trees, shrubs and pots spilling over with all the colours of the Mediterranean. You could potter about for hours along shaded walkways as if wandering around your own private garden. The word that kept coming into my mind was 'tranquil', which, given there are more than 250 rooms, is amazing. Even the staff seemed completely relaxed, but they were also highly efficient and went out of their way to make everyone feel special. On a couple of occasions I arranged for a babysitter for Indio and, believe me, I am not a mother who readily leaves her child with a total stranger. But I trusted them completely and Indio seemed to look forward to their arrival. There were very few British people staying - and lots of Italians. I took that as a good sign because Italians love children. They also love food and wine and are at their best in the sunshine. Come to think of it, food, wine and sunshine rate high on my own list of priorities — especially food, after MasterChef, where to my astonishment I reached the final. The big morning decision was whether to make camp by the pool or on one of the beaches. Bolts from the blue: The hotel sits on the serene waters of the Strait of Bonifacio . I liked having that choice and what I liked especially was that the beaches were quiet and not overrun with jet skiers. One day, I dropped Indio off at the kids' club and booked in for a day of windsurfing and kitesurfing. I learned to windsurf in Barbados, where my mother and brother still live and where I try to visit as often as I can. But I had never attempted kite-surfing. Kite-surfing is great fun once you get the hang of it - and you need a good teacher. It's also fantastic exercise, because it depends a lot on core muscles and, as we are relentlessly told by fitness gurus, it's those core muscles that form the basis of a well-toned body. With kitesurfing, you first have to learn how to fly a kite, which means getting to grips with the direction of the wind. In fact, there's a lot of preparation work to do before going on the water and having a board strapped to your feet. I seemed to get the hang of it. Perhaps our best day was when we went out on Poseidon, one of the resort's fishing boats. We went exploring around the north point and then visited the island of Maddalena. It was magical - and the ice creams were the best ever. We called in at the church of Santa Maria Maddalena and then I swam back to the boat and was met with drinks and canapes. Delphina has a Thalasso spa, where I spent as much time as I could. It has lots of jets that pummel your body into submission but afterwards you feel amazingly invigorated and ready to conquer the world. Actually, I think Indio and I both felt ready to conquer something or other after our a week at Delphina. More importantly, our holiday worked brilliantly for both of us. I know we will be back and just hope it's soon.

"FOR decades their names have been at the heart of British life but Cadbury, Heinz and Marks & Spencer have now dropped off the list of our favourite ‘superbrands’. Instead, John Lewis, Lego and Häagen-Dazs are seen as integral parts of the country’s fabric. Dyson and Virgin Atlantic are also new entries in the top 20 most popular big brands – an annual survey of 2,500 shoppers by market analysts at the Centre for Brand Analysis. Love lost: Cadbury, Heinz and Marks & Spencer have now dropped off the list of Britain's top 20 favourite ‘superbrands’, having been replaced by John Lewis, Lego, Virgin Atlantic and Häagen-Dazs . Topping the chart for the second year running is British Airways, followed by Rolex, which was founded in London in 1905. Cadbury was last year No 11 but does not even feature this year – following a string of controversies since it was taken over by American company Kraft in 2010. The most recent public backlash came a few weeks ago when it changed the recipe of Creme Eggs and shrank the size of their multipacks. Heinz – famed for its baked beans, tomato ketchup and tinned soups – has also slipped off the list after appearing at No 5 last year. It is not known why the company, which has always been US-owned, is falling out of favour with Britons. What's not to love: Ice cream brand Häagen-Dazs is new on the top-20 superbrands list . But our increasing curiosity in more exotic flavours and dishes could be one reason. However, the demise of M & S, which was No 18 in 2014, will be particularly painful for its bosses, especially as rival John Lewis has leapt into the chart at No 6. Marks & Spencer has endured three difficult years, fuelled by poor sales of its womenswear and teething troubles with its new website. Virgin Atlantic makes its first appearance at No 20 but has some way to go before catching up with winner BA. Just last week, BA’s parent company IAG said it expected profits to surge 20 per cent to around £1.6billion this year. The firm’s share price hit an all-time high as a result. Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive of the Centre for Brands Analysis, said: ‘British Airways retaining the No 1 spot is a great example of a much-loved traditional brand that has also refreshed, refocused on innovation and invested to remain attractive and relevant. ‘It is winning out, while newer innovators, such as Google, go in reverse, as the shine comes off.’ The internet giant has slipped from No 7 to 18, while Apple – the richest company in the world and best-known for its computers and mobile phones – is at a relatively lowly 10. Both have suffered a backlash over accusations they have failed to pay a fair share of their taxes in the UK.","Heinz and Marks & Spencer no longer on Britain's favourite brands list .

"A student high on miaow miaow stabbed his mother 11 times before cutting off his own penis at an 'exceptional' attack in their home. Charles Mann launched the frenzied attack on his mother, Emma, in December 2013 after bingeing on the party drug and copious amounts of alcohol. After stabbing his mother repeatedly the 21-year-old turned the knife on himself to cut off his genitalia and was heard shouting: 'I love you but this is the prophecy' near their home in Haywards Heath, West Sussex. Charles Mann, 21, stabbed his mother Emma 11 times and cut off his own penis after taking a cocktail of miaow miaow, cannabis and alcohol . He was jailed for 16 months today after admitting Grievous Bodily Harm. As her son entered the dock at Hove Crown Court, Ms Mann was seen mouthing 'I love you' in his direction. She required surgery for multiple punctures to one of her lungs and was wounded on her arms, head and neck following the attack. The court heard how she made a frantic 999 call at 6.20am on December 29, telling operators: 'My son's just attacked me and stabbed me and he's going mental downstairs with the knives.' Ms Mann was woken when her son returned home and began 'trashing' his room. The court heard how he followed her into the kitchen where he stabbed her 11 times. The 21-year-old, who received treatment at a psychiatric facility before being transferred to Lewes Prison, was so high during the attack he was 'not responding to pain'. 'He was not reacting to pain and was described as manic and deranged,' said prosecuting counsel Amy Packham. When police arrived at the family home, he is said to have told officers: ""I have stabbed her multiple times, I have killed her. The 21-year-old was sentenced to 16 months behind bars after pleading guilty to Grievous Bodily Harm. His mother, right leaving court, was seen mouthing 'I love you' during the hearing . ""I have stabbed my mum and I need to be punished for what I have done."" 'He said he had taken miaow miaow, loads of lines of it, and a lot of alcohol. He appeared manic and deranged at the time. He was said to have described himself as a 'paedophile' to police officers and begged: 'I do not want to live. 'Take me to the light, I can see the vampires.' After pleading guilty to Grievous Bodily Harm at an earlier hearing the 21-year-old was jailed for 16 month, reduced to eight. He will only serve another four weeks owing to the time already spent in custody. Sentencing, judge David Rennie described the family's case as 'wholly exceptional'. Earlier Ms Mann spoke at the difficulty of seeing her son's fate 'already sealed'. 'This case has a number of features which make it if not unique wholly exceptional. The lack of total awareness and capacity to form intent was the direct result of drug induced psychosis,' said Judge Rennie. 'I further recognise that in your psychotic state you inflicted life altering injuries on yourself and have taken this cocktail of drugs before without any particular side effects. 'Your mother is an extraordinary human being who has conducted herself with enormous dignity, and I thank her very much indeed.' David Etherington QC, representing Mann, said the defendant had become involved in taking drugs after completing his GCSEs and had spent time in The Priory trying to overcome his problem but had relapsed. Mann is undergoing physical and psychiatric treatment following the incident in December 2013. He is seen being led away from the Hove Crown Court in handcuffs . The 21-year-old was sentenced to 16 months reduced to eight months in jail at Hove Crown Court (above) He told the court: 'His parents even sent him to work on a kibbutz in Israel but the problems would come when he came home and fell in with the same crowd.' He told the court Mann had had hallucinations on occasions after taking drugs but 'had never had a reaction which caused him to be violent to another human being, particularly his mother who he loves very much and who he never had any conscious desire to hurt'. Mr Etherington said Mann had relied on evidence of the attack because he had 'virtually no coherent memory of what happened'. He continued: 'Looking back, in a mind that was very troubled at the time, he can only really rationalise it as being a suicide attempt by him in the grip of a delusion in which his mother somehow got involved.' The court heard that although Mann had been 'extremely mentally unwell at the time of the offence due to a drug induced psychosis"" he had now recovered but remained ""fragile and vulnerable.'","Charles Mann stabbed his mother Emma 11 times in a frenzied attack .

"Indiana man Kenneth Harden was charged with nearly 40 felonies last year but will only serve two years in jail after his wife changed her statement . An Indiana man charged with almost 40 felonies last year will only serve two years behind bars after his wife changed her statement to police. Kenneth Harden, 32, was charged with 38 crimes including rape, intimidation, strangulation criminal confinement and domestic battery after he allegedly abused his wife at their Seymour home. According to court documents, Harden made his wife sign a sex-slave contract and mark the document with her own blood. Harden's wife was forced to wear a collar and perform sex acts on a daily basis. There were also times he burned her with cigarettes, choked her until she was unconscious and locked her head in a box, the wife said. A search of their home revealed an 11--page document called 'Sex Slave Manual 2014' that outlined the woman's role, chores and punishments. The 'slave' told police she couldn't leave her 'master' because he controlled the medication she needed for her severe diabetes. After initially detailing her treatment to police following an incident on August 30, 2014, Harden's wife changed her statement. Before she changed her mind, the wife  said: 'I'm tired of the abuse. 'I'm tired of getting hit every day. 'Please, I'm scared.' Prosecutors felt their case against Harden had weakened substantially so they offered him a negotiated plea deal, the Indy Star reported. Some of the offenses Harden was charged with were each punishable by up to 20 years in prison. He will only serve two years in prison and be on probation for one after pleading guilty to one charge of criminal confinement. Jackson County Prosecutor AmyMarie Travis said the wife, who has not been identified, 'believes justice has been served'. Travis said: 'The victim's deposition was not consistent with her original police report. 'It became clear to the state of Indiana that it was proper to offer a negotiated plea agreement that we offered.' Harden and his wife met on Craiglist. He has been in jail since he was arrested. A change-of-plea hearing on the matter is scheduled for March 6 in Jackson Circuit Court.","Indiana man Kenneth Harden was charged with nearly 40 felonies last year .

"Fresh storms due to sweep across the Northeast this week are set to smash Boston's all-time record for winter snowfall, which has already surpassed 100 inches. Including a fresh fall Sunday night, the city has been buried by 103.9 inches of snow since the season began - and needs just 3.7 more to break the record of 107.6 inches, set in 1996. And current forecasts indicate that the historic total will be surpassed, with as much as eight inches of snow due in Massachusetts thanks to snowfalls predicted for Tuesday and Wednesday night. Scroll down for video . Buried again: Boston, pictured above last week, has been hit by 103.9 inches of snow this winter - and this week is set to break the all-time record . Higher! Heaps of snow in the city could be due to get even bigger thanks to new winter storms headed to the Northeast . As well as Massachusetts, this week could see snow across a huge chunk of the nation, thanks to two separate systems which are both due to strike the Northeastern corridor over the next few days, according to the Weather Channel. One will see around three inches of snow hit almost every state along the northern border, from Idaho, across the Great Lakes into New England and Maine. Another, less intense coating could cover an area stretching northeast from the Texas panhandle to Washington. Around Massachusetts, snowfall of 3 to 6 inches was expected by early Monday across the area. Snow is go: A huge chunk of the country is likely to see some snowfall before the week is out - with the Northeast once again at the center of the snowfall . Round one: The system, which the Weather Channel is calling Winter Storm Thor, will first see a band of snow hit the northernmost states . Round two: Wednesday will see a different band of snow stretching from southwest to northeast - bringing more snow to parts of the Northeast . Snow rest: In Queens, New York City, Min Park pauses to brush snow off his wife Michelle's face . Not always sunny: In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a pedestrian wraps up to walk along Broad Street in Sunday's snow . In the south of the state, and over Rhode Island, the totals are more likely to be 4 to 8 inches in southeastern. Up to 6 inches of snow was anticipated in northern Massachusetts and New York state, and on Cape Cod. Elsewhere, heavy snow was falling in the southern Rockies and Great Basin and heavy rain was soaking parts of the Southwest. A flood watch is in effect until 8pm Monday for east-central and south-central Arizona, including metropolitan Phoenix. Snow fell from the Ohio Valley into the Northeast for much of Sunday and freezing rain hit the Mid-Atlantic.

"Running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past. Ford has unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining, it bases its predictions on your unique driving style. The MyFord Mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house. The app was announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and currently works with a selection of Ford’s electric and hybrid cars. Smart car: To check their driving range, drivers open the app and add their location and destination . It specifically suits electric cars because the app can directly link to the battery to see a status level and accurate mileage. But Ford spokesman Abraham Phillip told MailOnline the team is working on developing the software for petrol and diesel range. However, he couldn’t give a timeframe for this because it depends on the technology being integrated, and legislation in individual markets. For example, due to emission restrictions in the EU users can’t use the MyFord Mobile app to remotely start their car, but they can in the US. Similar restrictions may apply for the fuel management feature. Cos: The MyFord Mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house (Ford's Focus Electric, pictured) The app uses a traffic light system to show if the journey is possible, or at least how far the driver can travel before needing to charge their car using a map (screenshots of app pictured) To check their driving range, drivers open the app and add their location and destination. The app uses a traffic light system to show if the journey is possible, or at least how far the driver can travel before needing to charge their car using a map. This map also shows the nearest charging stations, including their price. The first vehicles to offer MyFord Mobile in Europe will be the Focus Electric, available in spring 2015. Now available in Europe, the Focus Electric is powered by an electric motor and lithium-ion battery powertrain that achieves a top speed of 85mph (137 km/h). The 6.6 kW onboard charger has a driving range of 62 miles (100km) with two to three hours charging, and around 93 miles (150 km) driving range with three to four hours charging from a 32 A charging station.* . It additionally has Sync 2 voice control with touchscreen to let drivers programme charging times, and set a chosen cabin temperature for when they start the journey, from within the car. MyFord Mobile is also available for the C-MAX Energi plug-in electric hybrid vehicle. To learn a driver’s habits the app determines how far they have travelled within a certain time to gauge speed but also how often they braked, based on distances travelled, and when they accelerated significantly. The driver is then rated on a scale from ‘Zippy’ to ‘Zen’. To be more fuel efficient, the driver needs to be at the latter end of the scale. But if they’re not, the app offers tips such as releasing the accelerator or braking less heavily. The Trends screen additionally shows miles, or kilometres driven, and how much CO2 has been saved. Taking inspiration from gaming and personal fitness apps, MyFord Mobile shows CO2 savings as exercise balls, or hot-air balloons to reflect how much could be used to fill each. In terms of the ‘remote preparation’ features, the driver can set the cabin to warm up or cool down at a set time each day, or set the precise temperature. As well as informing drivers when they have made CO2 savings, alerts also let drivers know when they have reached certain zero-emission distance benchmarks, such as covering a distance equivalent to one round-the-world trip. This is shown as an Achievement figure. And if the driver can’t remember where they parked the car, the app will pinpoint its location on a map. The first vehicles to offer MyFord Mobile in Europe will be the Focus Electric, which also has Sync 2 voice-activated controls, available in spring 2015.

"A New Jersey cop under scrutiny for shooting an unarmed man in December has been hit with a $25million lawsuit alleging he forced a woman to repeatedly have sex with him after he caught her shoplifting. Shakera Brown says Bridgeton Officer Braheme Days detained her after she was reported shoplifting in January 2014. He allegedly told the 22-year-old: 'There are two ways we can handle this: I can take you to jail, or we can handle this in an adult manner.' For the next 11 months, Days repeatedly harassed Brown to perform sex acts on him and have sex with him in his patrol car, according to the lawsuit, reported by the South Jersey Times. Scroll down for video . Shakera Brown, 22, (left) seen here in a previous mugshot, claims she was extorted for sex repeatedly by Bridgeton Officer Braheme Days (right) after he caught her shoplifting . During each encounter, Days threatened her with jail if she didn't comply, she says. Days is already under investigation after he and his partner shot dead Jerame Reid during a December 30 traffic stop. Dashcam video form the patrol car shows Reid step out of the vehicle with his hands in front of him when Days and Officer Roger Worley open fire. Reid, a convicted felon, reportedly had a gun in the car, but was unarmed when he was gunned down by the officers. Days and Worley fired nine times, the newspaper reports. Days has nine complaints against him following his hiring in 2012 - though all of them were dismissed for 'lack of probable cause,' according to the Times. The police department, the city of Bridgeton and Days all declined to comment about the lawsuit to the Times. Court records show that Brown has a history of shoplifting arrests, the Times reports. She was caught by Days in January 2014 in the parking lot of a Rite Aid pharmacy. According to the lawsuit, Days gave her an ultimatum - she would be cuffed and carted off the jail or they could 'work something out.' Days and partner Officer Roger Worley (pictured) are under investigation for the December shooting of an unarmed man . Brown says she acquiesced and gave Days her phone number. The next day, he called her and demanded that she walk to his waiting patrol car. Days then allegedly demanded that she perform a sex act on him. When Brown told him she didn't want to - he told her that he'd take her to jail if she didn't do what he said, according to the lawsuit. Brown said she reluctantly agreed. Shortly after the first encounter, Days allegedly gave Brown a prepaid cell phone and harassed her repeatedly for sex on a daily basis. Every time Brown resisted, Days threatened to arrest her and take her to jail, according to the lawsuit. Brown is demanding $25million in damages from Days, the police department and the city of Bridgeton.","Shakera Brown claims in a lawsuit that Bridgeton, New Jersey, Officer Braheme Days forced her to have sex with him in exchange for not arresting her .

"Eating nuts and peanuts reduces the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke, a new study claims. Researchers found they were linked with a reduced risk of death from heart disease among people on low incomes. And they believe their findings suggest peanuts may be a cost-effective measure to improve cardiovascular health because they are so cheap. However experts cautioned today that salt-covered nuts would not have the same health benefits. Scroll down for video . Nuts reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke - and could be an easy, cost-effective way to prolong life . Nuts are rich in nutrients and peanuts, although classified as legumes, have nutrients similar to tree nuts. The new study, led by Dr Xiao-Ou Shu, of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Tennessee, analysed various groups of people. One involved 72,000 low-income black and white men and women living in the US, the other 134,000 men and women living in Shanghai, China. In both groups, men ate more peanuts than women. In the US group, about half of the nuts consumed were peanuts, and in the Chinese group only peanut consumption was assessed. Catherine Collins, Principal Dietitian at St George's Hospital NHS Trust, said: . 'Research over the past few years has shown heart-health benefits of including nuts and legumes (like peanuts) as part of a varied diet. 'This is probably because nuts and peanuts contribute a valuable source of protein, dietary fibres, healthy fats, vitamins B1, B6, folic acid, vitamin E, magnesium and zinc to the diet. Although almost half the weight of a peanut is fat (48%), the majority is of the heart-healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated types. Studies where nuts have been added to the diet (such as the European PREDIMED study), and long-term population studies have consistently shown a reduction in death from heart disease when nuts and legumes are included in the diet. The researchers found that across the board, eating nuts reduced the risk of death from heart disease. This was regardless of gender, race, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption and conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. In the US, the highest consumption resulted in a risk reduction of 21 per cent. In the Chinese group, it was 17 per cent. Dr Shu said: 'We observed no significant associations between nut or peanut consumption and risk of death due to cancer and diabetes.' She added the findings highlight the large public health impact of nut or peanut consumption in lowering deaths from heart disease - especially given their affordability. The research was published in JAMA Internal Medicine. Dr Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of the journal, added: 'Of course, peanuts are not really nuts - they are legumes since they grow in bushes, unlike tree nuts. Nuts reduced the risk of death regardless of gender, race, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption and conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity . 'But who cares if they help us to live longer at an affordable price?' However experts have cautioned that people should not start eating 'large quantities' of nuts and peanuts in light of the research. Commenting on the findings, Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'This large study found that death rates from heart attacks were lower in people who eat nuts, particularly peanuts, than in those who don't. 'However, the data do not show that the more peanuts you eat the lower the risk of a fatal heart attack, so people should not start eating large quantities of nuts, particularly salted nuts, in the hope that it will protect them from heart disease. 'The results suggest that including a modest amount of nuts as part of a well-balanced diet may be of benefit.'","Peanuts may be a 'cost-effective measure to improve heart health'

"Parents are increasingly pressuring doctors to delay vaccines for young children, raising the threat from preventable diseases such as the flu, measles and mumps, a new study suggests. Researchers from the University of Colorado surveyed 534 physicians across the country with 93 per cent reporting that they had received requests for jabs to be rescheduled. Some parents wanted to space shots out so their children weren't jabbed so many times in one sitting while others worried about possible vaccine-related neurological complications. Children in the U.S. receive around 29 vaccines for about 14 illnesses between birth and six years, based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Growing trend: Parents are increasingly pressuring doctors to delay vaccines for young children, raising the threat from preventable diseases such as the flu, measles and mumps, a new study suggests . Three-quarters of the doctors surveyed said they agreed to vaccine delays at least some of the time, even though they knew it was potentially harmful. In some cases, practitioners feared they would lose patients from their practice if they pushed the recommended vaccine schedule too hard. Only three per cent said they had refused such requests. Overall, 25 per cent of doctors said the demand for injection delays were up from the previous year. Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children have faced scrutiny after a measles outbreak in California blighted more than 100 adults and children since December. Most cases are tied to an outbreak at Disneyland in California, which likely began with a traveler who brought it in. However, the exact source of the Disneyland-linked cases is not known. Doctors are concerned about unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children becoming ill and spreading disease to others. The potential repercussions are worrisome and are happening 'right now with the measles outbreak,' said Dr. Allison Kempe, a University of Colorado researcher and a member of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee. The survey, conducted in 2012, didn't ask doctors which particular vaccines parents asked to delay. The recommended CDC vaccine schedules are based on research around what time they will be most effective at preventing disease. Delaying shots targeted for certain ages means they may be less effective later on. It also makes it more likely that children will never get vaccinated, because parents get too busy or forget to schedule another doctor's visit, said Dr. Robert Frenck, an infectious diseases specialist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. He was not involved in the new study, published in Monday's Pediatrics. 'People just don't understand that these diseases are all there, they're not gone. They're just being kept at bay right now. If people stop vaccinating, they come right back,' Frenck said. Doctors involved in the University of Colorado investigation were all certified members of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians - the two leading groups of doctors who treat young children.","Researchers from the University of Colorado surveyed 534 doctors across the country .

"A woman who blogged for years about her young son's constant health struggles was convicted this morning of poisoning him to death by force-feeding heavy concentrations of sodium through his stomach tube. A jury in the New York suburbs found Lacey Spears, of Scottsville, Kentucky, guilty of second-degree murder in the January 2014 death of 5-year-old Garnett-Paul Spears after nearly three days of deliberations. When she is sentenced next month, the 27-year-old Spears could face up to life in prison. The defense portrayed Spears as a caring mother and her son as sickly, but the prosecution argued that Spears reveled in the attention Garnett's illness brought her. Video showed Spears twice taking the boy into a hospital bathroom with a connector tube and the boy suffering afterward. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Lacey Spears, 27, pictured here in court today, was found guilty of killing her five-year-old son by poisoning him with salt . Spears showed little emotion as the jury returned a guilty verdict. Her defense team said she was in shock . Innocent child: Garnett-Paul Spears (left) died in January 2014 after prosecutors say his mother (right) force-fed him salt through his stomach tube . 'The motive is bizarre, the motive is scary, but it exists,' Assistant District Attorney Patricia Murphy said in closing arguments Thursday. 'She apparently craved the attention of her family, her friends, her co-workers and most particularly the medical profession.' She suggested that Spears, 27, eventually killed the boy because she feared he would start telling people she was making him ill. Her actions were 'nothing short of torture,' she said. According to multipple reports, the defendant showed little emotion as the guilty verdict was announced, but her attorney later said his client was shocked by the outcome of the trial and plans to appeal the conviction. Spears' sentencing was scheduled for April 8. She could face 15 years to life in prison. Several doctors testified that there was no medical explanation for the spike in Garnett's sodium levels that led to his death. But defense lawyer Stephen Riebling said there was no 'direct evidence' of a crime and drew out from witnesses that Spears seemed devastated by her son's death. He said the hospital video was edited to eliminate tender scenes between mother and son, including one where Spears puts two pairs of socks on Garnett. 'If she's planning on killing him, why does she care whether his feet are cold?' he asked the jury. He also said the hospital was negligent and dehydrated the boy — an assertion Murphy called 'just ridiculous.' Motive: Prosecutors argued that the 27-year-old mother made her child sick to get attention from her friends, family and co-workers . Conflicting versions: The defense insisted that Spears, pictured here February 3 weeping in court, seemed devastated by her son's death . Proud mom: Lacey wrote a blog of her love of her son and also his fight against his medical problems before his death in January 2014 . The evidence included two feeding bags found in Spears' apartment that were heavily tainted with salt, including one that Spears asked a friend to hide. One bag had the equivalent of 69 McDonald's salt packets in it, a forensic toxicologist testified. Also in evidence were many of Spears' postings on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and a blog and her online research into the dangers of sodium in children. Spears, an Alabama native, was living with her son in Chestnut Ridge, New York, when he died. She moved to Kentucky afterward and was living there when she was arrested. There was no mention at the trial of a disorder known as Munchausen by proxy in which caretakers secretly harm children to win sympathy. Some experts believe that disorder fits Spears' actions. Garnett-Paul Spears was airlifted from Nyack Hospital to Maria Fareri Children's Hospital in Westchester, New York, on Janaury 19, 2014, after complaining of severe abdominal pain caused by  a suspected stomach virus. But Garnett's doctors quickly became suspicious after detecting elevated sodium levels in his system. The little boy's condition worsened and he died January 23 after falling into a coma. Two months later, the 5-year-old's death was ruled a homicide. Something's awry: Garnett's doctors quickly became suspicious after detecting elevated sodium levels in his system when he was brought to a hospital in Westchester, New York, in January 2014 . The little boy's condition worsened and he died January 23 after falling into a coma . Liar: On her blog, (above) Spears posted emotional messages about the tragic death of Garnett's father. It was all a fake . The Journal New reported in May 2014 that a friend of Lacey Spears described her behavior at her son's death bed as 'weird' and not befitting a grieving mother. 'She was more concerned about what everyone else was saying, or what investigators were asking people, or what people were saying on Facebook, than putting all that aside and taking care of her child,' the unnamed friend recalled. Others said they were disturbed to see the 27-year-old snapping pictures of her desperately ill son to post on Facebook. Following her son's tragic death, further disturbing details have emerged about Spears' behavior. The mother lived in a bizarre fantasy world, inventing a hero cop fiancé who died in a car crash and telling everyone her friend’s little boy was her own child, it has been claimed. On her blog, she even wrote of the heartbreaking moment Garnett asked her where his dead daddy was. But her ‘soulmate’ Blake never really existed. A man called Chris Hill has revealed he is the boy’s real dad. He said the pair had a brief affair around six years ago, but after initially admitting she was carrying Mr Hill’s child, Spears changed her story and completely shut him out of her life, before leaving town and never coming back. Spears lied that Garnett's dad was her hero cop fiance who died in a car crash. In reality, the boy's biological father was a man who had a brief affair with Spears . Clue: A friend of Lacey Spears described her behavior at her son's death bed as 'weird' and not befitting a grieving mother . And her former best friend Autumn Hunt, told MailOnline in May 2014 how after Spears started regularly looking after her son, Jonathon, she began telling people he was her own child. After Garnett was born, she uploaded snaps of the two boys together, referring to them as, ‘brothers’ and ‘my babies.' The Florida Department of Children and Families revealed last April that they've had a file on Spears since 2011, when an anonymous call voicing concerns about her parenting was made to their abuse hotline. And prior to that, in 2009 while the family lived in Alabama, Garnett suffered severe seizures and had to be flown by helicopter to a Decatur hospital and resuscitated. Munchausen by proxy, is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child — to get attention. 'It is so counter-intuitive to all our ideas of what parenthood is supposed to be,' said Dr. Marc D. Feldman who has written extensively about Munchausen syndrome.'But medical child abuse can and does occur.' Feldmen told USA Today that this case has at least four distinct red-flags for him that indicate the possibility of abuse. 1) Garnett had a feeding tube for unknown reasons. In case of Munchausen by proxy the child will be sick enough to have a feeding tube or intravenous line that gives the abuser access to the body internally.'That's an avenue for medical chaos,' Feldman said. 'A feeding tube is a real red flag.' 2) It is almost physically impossible to ingest or force feed a lethal does of salt. However, introducing it over time through a feeding tube is possible. 3) Feldman points out that those with Munchausen often exhibit pseudologia fantastica — compulsive lying - Spears told lies about her partner and about being a mother . 4) Exaggerated stories of their child being ill is another symptom - and in this case Spears obsessively detailed her child's illnesses onlinePeople with the condition also have borderline personality disorder, a psychiatric condition marked by problems with impulsive and reckless behavior, leading to unstable relationships. Signs of Munchausen by proxy can include: .","Lacey Spears, 27, found guilty of second-degree murder in January 2014 death of her 5-year-old son, Garnett-Paul Spears .

"A coffin measuring almost 8ft long that has been specially made for Britain's former tallest man will be carried by ten pallbearers at his funeral. Christopher Greener, of Bromley in south London, grew to 7ft 6ins tall before surgical intervention stopped him growing. He held the record as the UK's tallest man for four decades. The 71-year-old, who weighed 30 stone, had to have a bespoke coffin made after he died last month and will be buried in a double plot of land near to his home. Christopher Greener, formerly Britain's tallest man, will be buried in a bespoke coffin measuring almost 8ft that will need to be carried by 10 pallbearers . Funeral directors have calculated that Mr Greener's coffin will need at least 10 pallbearers to carry it because of the size and weight of the casket. Usually there are four pallbearers to carry a coffin. They estimate the coffin will just about fit into the hearse, with less than two inches of space left. Matthew Uden, funeral director at Hayes-based W. Uden & Sons, said: 'We've had to have the coffin specially made. 'They are normally about 6ft 2ins but this is just under 8ft - it's quite a difference. 'But the real struggle is making sure it's tough enough as he was quite a heavy chap too. 'We measured everything before we ordered the coffin and it just about fits into the hearse by about 2ins.' Because of its size Mr Greener's coffin also has extra handles fitted so it can be carried by the extra pallbearers. Mr Greener was diagnosed at 27 with a condition known as pituitary gigantism where a tumour had grown on his pituitary gland, an organ that controls bodily functions including release of growth hormones. Funeral directors said more pallbearers will be needed to carry the coffin because of its length and weight . Mr Greener held the title of Britain's tallest man for four decades and is pictured  in 1996 outside the Market Weighton house once owned by Yorkshire's 7ft 9ins Giant William Bradley and later by Sylvia France (left) Surgeons removed the tumour when he was already in the record books for being UK's tallest man and he would have continued to grow if they had not. He played basketball internationally for Great Britain in the late 60s and early 70s and played the circus giant in David Lynch's film The Elephant Man. Barry Tolson, who lives in Spain after emigrating from Croydon, south London, was Mr Greener's friend for more than 20 years and is helping to arrange the funeral. He said: 'Chris, as my wife would say was a gentle giant. He was very funny, caring and kind and our whole family will miss him terribly. 'He struggled towards the end of his life with his health and found it increasingly difficult to get around. 'Mowing the lawn and day-to-day chores were extremely difficult for him being so extremely tall but he was always cheery and never stopped making us laugh. Mr Greener lost his title as Britain's tallest man in 2007. The 71-year-old spent the majority of his life towering over friends and family. He is pictured above at a friend's wedding . Mr Greener's height afforded him roles in films. Above, he is prepared for an appearance by a make-up artist . 'He even joked to Irene, my wife, that he expected getting a coffin to fit him could be difficult and that he wouldn't mind if we just got someone to ""break his legs"".' Christopher will be buried at St Mary's Cemetery in Hayes, Bromley, on March 9, after he died on February 11 at nearby Princess Royal University Hospital. Mr Greener lost his title of Britain's tallest man when he was replaced in 2007 by Neil Fingleton, who measures 7ft 7.56ins tall. Mr Fingleton, from Durham, also played basketball and is now an actor, having recently starred alongside Mila Kunis in Jupiter Ascending. Neither however beat the record of William Bradley, who at 7ft 9ins tall, was known as the Yorkshire Giant until his death in 1820. Last year Leonid Stadnyk, believed to be the world's tallest man at an estimated 8ft 5in tall, was carried to a graveyard on the back of an open truck because his remains were too large for a hearse. Throughout his life Mr Stadnyk, of Ukraine, had been refused to be measured to determine his height because he said it would be humiliating. Among the activities Mr Greener was able to take part in was basketball where he shone on the court . Left, Mr Greener towers over his father who is stood on the front step of their home in a photograph taken in the 1960s. Right, friend Barry Tolson holds a pair of his suit trousers .

"ISIS has threatened Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and his employees after the site removed accounts linked to the extremists. Twitter confirmed to Daily Mail Online that the company was working with authorities to verify the seriousness of the threat which claimed employees' necks are 'a target for the soldiers of the Caliphate'. The chilling warning, written in Arabic, featured a picture of Dorsey in a gun's cross-hairs and the Twitter logo. It was posted on Sunday on an anonymous site based in Poland which is used by programmers to share code. Dorsey, who is worth an estimated $2.5billion and lives in California, made no mention of the threat online on Sunday as he tweeted his 2.87million followers. The threat featured a picture of Twitter billionaire co-founder Jack Dorsey in a gun's cross-hairs and the Twitter logo . The alleged threat,  first reported by Buzzfeed, mentioned Dorsey and included the words: 'We always come back.' In a statement to Daily Mail Online, a Twitter spokesperson said on Monday: 'Our security team is investigating the veracity of these threats with relevant law enforcement officials.' When entered into Google translate (which does not provide an exact translation) the message is titled: 'Tweets in response to a campaign to delete accounts.' It goes on: 'You started this failed war'. The message then appears to address Dorsey directly and Twitter employees. It reads: 'Hey Jack... when their necks officially become a target for the soldiers of the Caliphate and supporters scattered among your midst!' It also claimed killing employees 'outside a neighborhood pub' would be no more preventable than the massacres of Charlie Hebdo killer Amedy Coulibaly and Copenhagen shooter Omar el-Hussein. The message later reads: 'Imagine the scene and wait for its occurrence at any moment, and the earliest opportunity! 'Virtual your war on us in the Internet will pull you real wars on earth!' It closes with the threat: 'Is the message reached my Twitter?' ISIS have posted horrific videos and images of executions, including beheadings, on mainstream sites online. According to Twitter's rules: 'You may not publish or post direct, specific threats of violence against others.' Twitter and YouTube both removed violent material and propaganda linked to ISIS.

"Five men have been poisoned in Japan after allegedly asking a restaurant to serve them banned parts of the world's most toxic fish. The men were having dinner on Friday night in the western city of Wakayama when they ate puffer fish liver, which prompted vomiting and breathing difficulties early the next morning. Puffer fish - also called blowfish or fugu in Japanese - are the world's most toxic group of fish and their livers, ovaries and skin contain tetrodotoxin, 100 times more lethal than cyanide. Dicing with death: Five Japanese men were poisoned after eating banned parts of the puffer fish (file photo) Yet eating the fish's flesh is a tradition in Japan, where wealthy diners play the Russian roulette of the restaurant world by dining on sashimi slivers so thin they are almost transparent. According to a city health official, the men asked to eat a banned, toxic part of the fish - which the most foolhardy fugu aficionados are said to enjoy for the tingling it produces on the lips. Popular: The tradition of eating thin slices of 'fugu' persists despite dozens of poisonings a year . The tingling is only the first symptom of tetrodotoxin poisoning, and is seen as part of the thrill for lovers of the fish. But if the toxin is served in any significant quantity it then paralyses the muscles, suffocating victims as it reaches their chests and diaphragms while they are still conscious. The health official said the men were in their 40s and 50s and the restaurant was shut down for five days from yesterday amid an investigation. 'They consumed a dinner that included liver, which is regarded as toxic material,' she told AFP, reading from a statement. Calls to the restaurant went unanswered. Chefs who want to serve puffer fish must train for two years before taking a rigorous test which a third of applicants fail. The most prized species is the tiger puffer, takifugu rubripes, whose flesh is safe to eat but whose liver, ovaries and intestine can all kill. It is not clear which species of puffer fish the men ate. Puffer fish account for the majority of Japan's food poisoning deaths but the delicacy shows no sign of dying out, although it is heavily regulated. Government figures show 30 to 50 people are hospitalised every year, with a few of those cases leading to death.","Men in their 40s and 50s ate at restaurant in Wakayama, Japan, on Friday .

"The newly released The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is every bit as starry as the first film, with Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith and Richard Gere at centre stage. But India plays its supporting role with equal charm and grace. Painted elephants, marble palaces, magnificent forts, wandering cows, pale pink turbans and flickering candles tell of the noise, smells and rich colours of this flamboyant country. A city of colours and sounds: Jaipur is the spectacular setting for The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel . Filmed in Rajasthan, the film is based in its capital, Jaipur. But ask any resident of the city about the film and you will be met with a blank stare. Our wonderful guide, Rajendra, was aware of it only because a client had pointed out 'the apparently very famous Judi Dench' in the Rambagh Palace Hotel. Bollywood, not Hollywood, still rules the screens here. While it might be too late to see Richard Gere in the crowded alleyways of the bazaars, you will spot plenty of other desirable items. Jaipur is a shopper's paradise and Indians flock here for silks and the region's hand-made, block-printed cottons. This is also considered the place to come for jewels. The stones are not mined here, but cut, polished and set better than anywhere else. Visit the iconic jeweller of Jaipur, the Gem Palace, one-time court jewellers to the Mughal emperors and run by the Kasliwal family since 1852. Classic glamour: Judi Dench (left) stars in a movie which shows off Jaipur (right) at its most evocative . Here are ruby chandelier earrings, enamel rings with floral mughal designs and moonstone necklaces. You can watch them being worked on in their basement workshop, using skills that have been passed down the generations. For inexpensive sparkle, head to Bangle Lane (Maniharon ka Rasta) in the old city, where you can choose from a multitude of colourful lac bangles for a handful of rupees. Made from resin produced by the female lac insect, they are embedded with mirror pieces, stones, beads or painted. For fashion, Hot Pink is the most sophisticated venue, with high-collared men's waistcoats and moccasins in all hues, as well as kaftans and shawls. The best block-printed fabrics, a craft that dates back to the 1700s, are at Riddhi Siddhi, where cloth is piled from floor to ceiling. Wander, too, through the spice market, past paan wallahs filling betel leaves and the flower market, where scented roses, fragrant jasmine and marigolds are made into garlands to offer to your favourite deities. Magical moments: ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is every bit as starry as the first film"" The Pink City is so-called for its coloured wash, intended to replicate Indian sandstone, a more noble material than the lime and mortar of which the buildings are actually made. With its city gates and crenellated walls, it makes for a striking sight. There are iconic landmarks, such as the five-storey, 18th-century Palace of the Winds, with its latticed screen facade allowing street life to be viewed by the veiled ladies within. Before 1727, when Sawai Jai Singh II created Jaipur, the City of Victory, neighbouring Amber, was the capital. The magnificent Amber Fort, to which you can ride on an elephant, offers panoramic views over Maota Lake and the ornamental gardens that seem to float within. The 16th and 17th century interiors impress with their exquisitely carved silver doors, ceilings of alabaster and an Indian version of the Hall of Mirrors with mirrored fragments embedded in vaulted ceilings glinting between arches. Today, the Jaipur royal family live in the City Palace, where rooms are open to the public. Gone is their Rambagh Palace, which became India's first palace hotel in 1957 (do try its Suvarna Mahal restaurant). But their newly elegant Rajmahal Palace has recently been re-opened. Dating back to 1729, this was once the British residency and later home to the polo-playing Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II, who entertained the Queen, Lord Mountbatten, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and Jacqueline Kennedy. A vision in pink: The Palace of Winds is one of Jaipur's - and Rajasthan's - most iconic structures . Their names adorn some of the 14 suites in the palace's new chapter as a hotel managed by Sujan Luxury. The decor, by acclaimed designer Adil Ahmad, offers vivid turquoises and shocking pinks, gilded mirrors and sweeping marble staircases - but, sadly, not Richard Gere. Abercrombie & Kent (01242 851 868, www.abercrombiekent.co.uk) offers three nights' B&B in Jaipur at the Rajmahal Palace with city tour, trip to the Amber Fort, transfers and flights via Helsinki with Finnair from £1,775 per person, based on two sharing a double room.","Jaipur is the setting for new movie The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel .

Preen combined a multitude of colours for their collection resulting in a bright, boho vibe. Temperley also stayed true to their bohemian roots, creating a nomad-themed collection. Of course the catwalk looks are not easy to recreate head to toe. Take from the shows snippets of what you love, use the catwalk for inspiration and ideas to carry over into your own wardrobe. Louise loved the bright, bold colours being showcased by Christopher Kane on the catwalk . We loved Temperley London's grey and yellow colour palette; Erdems textured opulent skirts teamed with soft knits and Preens cool mix of folklore prints layered with lumberjack coats. Thanks to high demand these looks tend to filter through from catwalk to high street in as little as three weeks, so those of us who don't have a bottomless budget can achieve a designer finish. A Style Album get just as excited for the street style images as the catwalk. Antonio Berardi's show was another picked out by A Style Album for its vibrancy and textures . Street Style is a massive part of Fashion month with Street Style photographers heading to the four Fashion Capitals to cover outside the shows. Favourite looks from London for us were Laura & Petro of wardrobe icons.com. We love Petro's bright yellow oversized coat from new label Raey, available at matchesfashion.com. And Laura, matching her lipstick with her Valentino clutch a great combination set of by her cream Alice & Olivia coat. And top marks for the stylish lady in the Isabel Marant patchwork coat worn over a neutral colour palette. We got the Style Album team together to take in the atmosphere during London Fashion Week. We stayed at the luxurious Rosewood Hotel, which was great for it's close proximity to Somerset house, the hub of London Fashion Week.

"Witnesses who saw police officers kill a homeless man on LA's skid row yesterday have trashed claims that he was trying to shoot them with one of their own weapons. Stunned passers-by saw three officers fire at least five shots at the pinned-down man, who was confronted by cops on Skid Row. It came as more information emerged about the drifter, whom friends say was mentally ill and battling drug addiction. Referring to him as 'Booth', 'Cameroon' or 'Africa' - references to his home country - fellow Skid Row vagrants say he lived in a tent on the streets and often read the Bible. Police chiefs have insisted their officers only killed the man because he was trying to snatch an officer's handgun and turn it on him - but the claims didn't wash with people on the scene. Officers are now compiling more evidence of the incident - including footage from a police body cam. Scroll down for videos . Shot dead: A homeless man, circled in red, was gunned down by the Los Angeles Police Department yesterday. Above is the moment directly after the fatal scuffle, after police had backed away . Killing: This is the moment police fired shots at the homeless man, who is obscured from view in the above frame by an officer. The LAPD have claimed he was trying to take an officer's gun . At least one officer was wearing a recording device during the encounter, and surveillance cameras were also overlooking the street. More witnesses are also thought to have filmed the killing on their cell phones. LAPD officials say the man was wanted in connection with a robbery, and started brawling with officers who approached him. However, witnesses have characterized the police response as overly aggressive, and say they should have been able to restrain a mentally-ill homeless man with non-lethal means. Shocking video footage shows the man, who was apparently known in the area as 'Africa', lashing out at police, who force him to the ground. Police first tried to use a Taser on the floored man, but officers say it had no effect. After the stun gun is fired, an officer can be heard shouting 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!'. Seconds later, five gunshots are heard in quick succession. The footage does not show the scuffle clearly. Outraged crowds soon gathered at the scene, accusing the police of unjustly killing him. A police statement on the killing said that 'the suspect and officers struggled over one of the officer's handguns' before shots were fired. But crowds of people who were watching gave a different interpretation of the chaotic encounter. One was Dennis Horne who told NBC's Today program he has his own footage of the incident. When asked whether the man reached for a policeman's gun, he said: 'My footage don't say that, my eyes didn't see that.' Yolanda Young, another bystander, said: 'He didn't bother nobody, he didn't have no weapon, they just shot him.' Jerome Guillory, who also saw the attack, said: 'There was no reason to do that to him, the guy, he wasn't no threat to them.' Another witness, Lonnie Franklin, 53, did not comment on whether the man was trying to shoot back, but said the police's use of force was excessive. Fight: At the beginning of the encounter, the man is seen taking swings at several police officers on Skid Row . Confronted: He was being confronted over reports of a robbery before five shots were fired . He told the LA Times: 'That man never was a threat - the amount of officers present at the time could have subdued him.' Daily Mail Online spoke with a close friend of Africa on Monday, who said the man moved to LA sixth months ago, and had a combination of mental illness and drug addiction problems. Nick ‘KB’ Gee said the man’s real first name is Booth, but people called him ‘Africa’ because he was originally from Cameroon. ‘Booth was trying to get back home to Africa but he didn’t have no money, that’s why he was homeless,’ Gee said. ‘‘I talked to him a lot of days, he was a very respectful, honest man. He didn’t bother nobody, he would sit in his tent reading his Bible. ‘He told me about his family and he said he had to go back home to take care of some things.’ ‘He don’t have nobody out here so I would come down and help him out, get him food, some money, a cigarette,’ he said. Nick said police had responded not because of a robbery but because Booth was arguing with a neighbor who lived in a tent next to his. ‘A lot of guys who know him would have helped calm him down, the police know the man, they talk to him everyday, ask him to take his tent down,’ he said. Friend: Nick Gee spoke to Daily Mail Online about the man who was shot dead . Tributes: Flowers were left by the man's Skid Row tent Monday as people attacked the LAPD for the killing . ‘You’re dealing with a guy with a combination of mental illness and drug addiction, they used over excessive force. ‘They Tasered him and he was scared and tried to run in to the tent, they dragged him out and instead of five cops holding him down they shot him.’ One homeless man who identified by his nickname ‘Juju’ said he was friends with Africa, whom he said he last saw no more than 30 minutes before the shooting. He told the LA Times that he was also was also known as ‘Cameroon,’ for his home country. Juju said they had been chatting about politics the last time they spoke. ‘They did not have to kill my friend,’ Juju said. He said his fellow homeless friend’s problems with police were nothing new. There were arguments most days between Africa and LAPD officers over taking down his tent, Juju said. In memoriam: This carboard plaque pays tribute to the man, known as Cameroon or Africa by locals . ‘He would say, “Ticket me. Give me my day in court,”’ he said. But despite his run-ins with the law, Juju said Africa was a generally peaceful man. ‘He was generous,’ he told the LA Times. ‘He lived in a tent, but he was content.’ The LAPD has its own investigation into the killing, which will 'determine whether the use of deadly force was consistent with Department policies and procedures'. LA County's district attorney's office will also conduct its own probe. Last night, LAPD spokesman Andy Smith insisted that the shots only came after the struggle over a firearm. He told reporters: 'During the attempt to detain him, this individual resisted our officers. Theys struggled with him, they tried to tase him a couple of times.' 'That was ineffective and eventually the struggle occurred where the officers that were struggling with the individual over one of the officer's weapons. Police have not formally identified the man they killed. A spokesman told DailyMail.com that no more information would be released Monday, and that any body cam footage would be held back until after the LAPD's own investigation was over. Shooting: The attack took place in the Skid Row district of Los Angeles, which is known for its large homeless population .","LAPD officers killed man during confrontation around noon Sunday .

"Russian television presenter and opposition supporter Ksenia Sobchak has received death threats following the murder of Boris Nemtsov . A glamorous Russian television presenter and opposition campaigner - who Vladimir Putin has known since she was a child - today revealed she is facing internet threats warning she will be the next to die after slain Boris Nemtsov. Ksenia Sobchak, 33, retweeted sickening messages, one of which warned her: 'Give up Ksenia, your death will be fast.' The poisonous postings - which also threaten other prominent Putin foes - came after she gave a warm recollection of Mr Nemtsov, remembering how, as a child, she was taken on a sledge ride by him in Davos, Switzerland. Mr Nemtsov was gunned to death in the shadow of the Kremlin late on Friday. Ms Sobchak is the daughter of Putin's political mentor, the late Anatoly Sobchak, liberal mayor of St Petersburg, the Russian President's former law professor who gave him his first political job after he quit the KGB. For years there were rumours that she was Putin's goddaughter - and though this is not the case, many of his supporters have not forgiven her stinging and articulate opposition to his policies. One tweet, using an insulting nickname for the TV host, posted online about Mr Nemtsov's slaying said: 'I am also very happy that there is one bastard less; when is it your turn, Horse?' A user called Vadim, posting a picture of a man pointing a gun, and a list of six prominent opposition surnames - Nemtsov, Navalny, Sobchak, Kudrin, Kasyanov, Khodorkovsky - wrote: 'Just politics, nothing personal'. Mr Nemtsov's name has been ticked off and Ms Sobchak's was number three on the list. 'Good News' - another user - sent Ms Sobchak a message which said: 'Give up Ksenia, your death will be fast'. He used the hashtag: 'Death to Sobchak'. User Unosobad posted: 'Your turn soon, Ksysha. MGER and RKSM promise it.' Ksysha is a fond name in Russian for Ksenia while the acronyms stand for radical groupings - the Young Squadron of United Russia, and the Russian Communist Youth Union. Ms Sobchak (right), who has known Vladimir Putin (left) since she was a child, was threatened after she recalled fond memories of Mr Nemtsov . The glamorous television presenter has long-opposed Putin's policies despite it being being rumoured for years that she was the president's goddaughter . Opposition supporters Ksenia Sobchak (right) and Ilya Yashin (left) join mourners in Moscow hours after the shooting of Boris Nemtsov . Last year, Ms Sobchak claimed many well-to-do young Russians were fleeing the country because of Putin's authoritarian policies and the Ukrainian conflict. In the wake of Mr Nemtsov's death, she warned that Putin had unleashed forces in Russia over which he now has no control. 'Actually it would be in some way less worrying if Putin had ordered Nemtsov's killing,' she wrote. 'It would be an awful system, but at least a system, a manageable system. But I feel, unfortunately, this is not the case. 'There is no Putin who gave a command to kill. But there is a Putin who has built a hellish Terminator, and he has lost control of it.' She also warned: 'There is no one controlling the process any more - there is chaotic hatred. 'Hatred that is fuelled every day by the federal mass media.' Ms Sobchak's late father Anatoly (left) was Mayor of St Petersburg with Putin as his deputy . President Putin clutches flowers at Ms Sobchak's father's funeral in 2000 . Of the shots that killed Mr Nemtsov, she said in her blog: 'These are only the first six bullets. There are troubled times ahead.' In December, she bravely challenged Putin in a television press conference, quizzing him about 'fifth columnists' - groups of people who bring down a government from within. Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow on Friday night . Putin predicted that the West would use such people to undermine Russia. 'Action by a fifth column, this disparate bunch of national traitors,' he said. Although he did not name who the 'traitors' were, Russian language sites soon suggested opposition figures including Mr Nemtsov and Ms Sobchak. When she was called to ask a question at Putin's press conference, the president chided his press spokesman: 'Why did you give her the floor?' Ms Sobchak told Putin: 'I would like to clarify for myself and our audience this fine line between the fifth column and the opposition.' She also claimed 'bullying' was again rife in Russia, as it was in her father's time, when Putin had acted to protect him. Earlier the former IT girl told how wealthy Russians are seeking an escape route. 'This is the main society talk in good restaurants in Moscow. It is either getting citizenship, or residence permits, or the like,' she said. Mr Nemtsov was shot dead on Friday night as he walked home with his Ukrainian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, 23. She has been held under armed guard by the Russians since and has not been allowed to return to Kiev. There are fears the Kremlin is trying to link the shooting to the conflict in Ukraine. An estimated 70,000 marched through Moscow yesterday to mourn the fallen opposition leader and to protest against the Putin government.","Glamorous Russian TV presenter and opposition campaigner faces threats .

"Apple and Samsung made bets on fingerprint scanning for their flagship phones but Fujitsu is taking a different route. The Japanese firm has developed an iris authentication system that unlocks a smartphone screen by scanning your eyes. And its prototype can be used to log into Facebook, email or other web services. Scroll down for video . Japanese firm Fujitsu has developed an iris authentication system that unlocks a smartphone screen by scanning your eyes. The prototype (pictured) can be used to log into Facebook, email or other web services . The demo of the prototype is on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. ‘Fujitsu’s new authentication method uses iris recognition, which is hard to forge and convenient to use,’ the firm told MailOnline. ‘The screen can be unlocked simply by looking at it, which eliminates the trouble of having to use [your] hands when wearing gloves and can’t use a fingerprint.’ The end of the password? For its prototype (demo pictured), Fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone.It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor onto the eyes and taking a picture of the patten with the infrared camera . Fujitsu has developed a ‘custom compact and high-output infrared LED’, and a custom infrared camera. Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye’s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina . These were combined with Fujitsu’s camera controller technology and biometric-authentication technology. It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris. The pattern doesn’t change significantly after the age of two, and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge. Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye’s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina. For its prototype, Fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone. It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera. This pattern is registered and linked to the user. Each time they look at their phone, the sensor scans their eye, matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device. ‘The system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations,’ a spokesman for Fujitsu told MaiOnline . ‘This can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance, rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require. ‘And in safety testing, the infrared LED light was verified to be safe for the eyes.’ The pattern  on a person's iris doesn’t change significantly after the age of two, and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge. Here a diagram shows how infra red  scanning is used to identify a person . Iris authentication is a type of biometric authentication, similar to fingerprint scanners. It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris, which is the ring around the pupil of the eye. Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices. This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with.

Fujitsu told MailOnline the sensor will work from ‘a standard smartphone viewing distance’, which is said to be up to 9 inches (22cm).

"Doctors  stress the importance of detecting disease early on to give people the best chance of recovery. And in the very near future you could get these early warning signs using just your smartphone. A San Francisco firm has developed a sensor that identifies gases and molecules released in a person’s breath that could hint at an underlying illness. Doctor in a stick? The very early model of the sensor (pictured) has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona . Advanced software and prediction algorithms are then used with a connected app to reveal any anomalies. The very early model of the sensor has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released either through everyday metabolic activity, or by diseases in the body. Once created, they travel into the blood and are released in urine or breath. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, the firm said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food . Some compounds, including carbon for instance, are released naturally. BoydSense has therefore developed software that can identify at which point the level of a gas or compound is beyond what is considered normal. It uses predictive algorithms to then convert the data so that patients and doctors can understand what the results mean. It is hoped that complex processing will prevent needless worry or give a false reading that suggests they are ill. If the sensor is added to a smartphone, for example, a patient could record their breath and the results could be sent to their doctor automatically. In particular, the sensors build on current breath gas analysers that are used to detect early signs of diabetes and even lung cancer. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, Mr Thuillier said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food. In the MailOnline demo, the BoydSense sensor was able to detect an orange within 30 seconds . BoydSense’s boss Bruno Thuillier gave MailOnline a demo of the technology at Mobile World Congress. The current sensor is a prototype and syncs with a smartphone via Bluetooth - although Mr Thuillier hopes future models will be embedded into the phones themselves. It takes around a minute to normalise and stabilise, a process needed to ensure that any readings are not contaminated by previous ‘sniffs’. This process is expected to be much faster on a finalised version, however. For the demo, the sensor is then placed inside a jar containing molecules released by oranges. Within about 30 seconds the sensor beeped to say it had recognised the molecules and a picture of an orange appeared on the connected smartphone. This was a simplified way of demonstrating its capabilities, but Mr Thuillier explained that the compounds released by oranges and vanilla - another jar in the demo - were complex enough to show its potential. If attached to a smartphone, the sensor could be placed in a fridge or cupboard and detect if chicken is nearing its best-before date, or if fruit and vegetables are about to turn. Mr Thuillier said: ‘I am excited to help lead in the creation of the first multi-bio sensing platform that detects and analyses biosignatures anywhere, anytime. This platform will improve the way consumers manage their wellness. BoydSense aims to be the world leader in solutions and services that enable and transform the way people gather and manage their biosignature analytics.’","The technology has been developed by BoydSense .

"A Muslim college student has said he was beaten by a gang of vigilante thugs for posing with five female Hindu classmates. Muhammad Riyaz, 20, was reportedly in the corner of a photo taken in India's conservative city of Mangalore which spread on WhatsApp and came to the attention of so-called 'moral police'. Speaking from his hospital bed, he said a gang kidnapped him and beat him mercilessly, demanding to know the location of his friend who had lain across the girls' laps. Offending image: Muhammad Riyaz, 20, was reportedly the student on the left-hand side of this photo taken in Mangalore, India, which spread on WhatsApp and came to the attention of so-called 'moral police' It is believed the photograph was first circulated on February 22 after being taken at a college in the suburb of Surathkal where Mr Riyaz studied computer science. It quickly caused ripples in the morally conservative part of India, causing 'emotional outbursts' among other students, the college claimed. Events came to a head when Mr Riyaz received a phone call from friends after a vigilante group had persuaded fellow college students to identify him. He said he went to a friend's house where a gang of men appeared and dragged him into a car, driving him to the edge of the city. While they beat him - including with wooden sticks - they demanded to know where his friend was and why he, a Muslim, had taken a photo with Hindu girls, he said. His ordeal lasted several hours, after which he was abandoned three miles from home and left to find his way to getting medical help. According to The News Minute, the student said: 'We were outside near the gate, when a Maruti 800 car came and they asked me something. Then suddenly, they just hold of me and dragged me into the car. 'All of us have been very close since the first year. If we were not close, would the girls permit it? 'See the photo. They are all smiling. If it was forced, then would the girls be smiling?' Assistant Commissioner of Police Ravi Kumar told The Indian Express: 'After the photograph was circulated on social media sites, a vigilante group got other students from the college to identify the deviant youth and on learning that he was probably a Muslim, decided to attack him.' Officers say Mr Riyaz's friend has gone into hiding rather than seek police protection, afraid that he will receive the same treatment from the mob. Despite the student's ordeal, the response from his college was initially unsympathetic. The five girls and one of the boys were suspended four days after the incident, and one teacher told an Indian news channel she was 'ashamed' of the way they had behaved by posing for the photo. However, the teacher added that she felt 'really sorry' for the students in the photo, who may yet be pardoned by their school. The city is in a part of India with several right-wing conservative Hindu groups, the most extreme of which are dubbed 'moral police'. Last month Hindu pressure groups said would confront unmarried couples in the street on Valentine's Day and demand they wed on the spot.","Muhammad Riyaz was part of playful group in city of Mangalore, India .

"It was all's well that ends well for this young elephant after it fell into a mud pit in Kenya. After wallowing in the dank ditch for up to 12 hours, these images and video capture the dramatic moment a digger saved the large mammal from a trunkful of trouble in a heroic rescue mission. The heart-rending rescue took place near Makindu in southern Kenya, where local farmers were shocked to find the distressed male elephant desperately trying to escape from a deep mud pit. Scroll down for video . The digger gets to work to save the stricken elephant after he got stuck in the well in Chyulu Hills National Park, southern Kenya . The young mammal was stuck wallowing in the dank ditch for up to 12 hours before he was able to make its way out of the muddy water . This is the moment the elephant made its break for safety, after the digger was able to create a gentle slope out of the heavy clay . Unable to help the large mammal climb the steep clay sides, wildlife conservationists enlisted the aid of a heroic construction company, who used their digger to plough the elephant to safety. Conservation scientist and wildlife photographer Jeremy Goss, 30, was on the scene to capture these dramatic photos and video footage of the courageous rescue on farmland bordering Chyulu Hills National Park. He said: 'It was heartbreaking to see the elephant in the well, particularly because the community had not been very keen or able to help it out. 'Elephants raid their crops and are generally not welcome, but it was a shocking sight for them nonetheless.' It is believed the young African elephant, which can weigh up to seven tonnes, the same weight as a London double decker bus, had been trapped in the murky sludge for up to 12 hours after it fell in the well while taking a drink. The elephant was thought to be searching for water in the area, which is experiencing an unusually intense dry period, when it discovered the man-made drinking well on farmland bordering the park, near the town of Makindu.

The young elephant appears to make a plea for help with his trunk (left), through which he was at least able to breath while he was stuck (right) Wildlife conservationists and park rangers from The Kenya Wildlife Service and Big Life Foundation were quick to the scene to help excavate the animal from its muddy prison. After it became clear there was no way for wildlife rangers to break the slippery bank, it was left to a digger from Chinese company China Road and Bridge Corporation, working on a nearby railway, to cultivate a gap in the bank allowing the mammal to walk to freedom. Exhausted from the ordeal, the elephant, which was too tired to move from the ditch, was eventually encouraged to make its dash out onto the open plains after being nudged by the digger. Jeremy said: 'This elephant had gone into a human dominated farming area that borders a national park at night to find water in a man-made well. 'The area has been experiencing a very dry period and water is hard to find. 'He must have slipped in while drinking and couldn't get out because of the steep clay sides. 'Wildlife conservationists watched helplessly for hours as the animal struggled in the well, but thankfully the Chinese construction company came to the rescue by providing the machine. Wildlife conservationists and park rangers from The Kenya Wildlife Service and Big Life Foundation were quick to the scene . The elephant enjoys his new found freedom. He was exhausted from the ordeal and was nearly too tired to move from the ditch . The elephant was eventually encouraged to make its dash out onto the open plains after being nudged by the digger . 'The digger managed to get the elephant out by digging one side out of the well, the operator having to make precision movements to avoid hitting the elephant in the small well. 'Once it emerged, it seemed very tired but otherwise seemingly unharmed.' Following the rescue, rangers were called upon to escort the elephant from the farmland back into Chyulu Hills National Park, home to the highest mountain range in eastern Kenya. Using land cruisers in tandem with a helicopter, the rangers tried to push the elephant in the direction of the 100 kilometre long national park, preventing it from moving back towards other farms and settlements. Jeremy said: 'There was then a difficult process where rangers had to prevent the elephant from moving back towards other farms, there were still lots of people that had been watching the rescue and they had to flee as the elephant ran in different directions. 'But it was a wonderful moment watching him escape from the well. It was because of humans that he ended up in trouble, but humans were able to help him survive. 'I just hope that he moved back into the safe natural area, and takes bit more care next time he goes for a drink.' Using land cruisers and a helicopter, rangers tried to push the elephant in the direction of the 100 kilometre long Chyulu Hills National Park . The move was needed to keep the male from heading back towards other farms and settlements where he may have got into more trouble .","Images capture dramatic moment the mammal bounded to safety after being stuck in the dank well for 12 hours .

"These are the photographs the Los Angeles Police Department claims prove that a homeless man they killed yesterday was trying to take an officer's gun away. A frame from an onlooker's video shows the man grabbing at an officer's waistband, police say, while a close-up of the weapon in question apparently shows damage caused by the scuffle. At least three officers opened fire on the man after he allegedly reached for the gun during the violent midday encounter on Skid Row. The man's name is thought to have been  Booth, but he is known locally as 'Africa' and 'Cameroon' in reference to his African heritage. Scroll down for video . Proof? Police say this frame shows the floored homeless man, circled center, reaching up for a police officer's gun during a fatal encounter yesterday in Lose Angeles . Shot dead: A homeless man, circled in red, was gunned down by the Los Angeles Police Department yesterday. Above is the moment directly after the fatal scuffle, after police had backed away . 'Damaged gun': The LAPD said this image shows the officer's pistol after the encounter. LA police chief Charlie Beck said damaged magazine and a partially-discharged bullet prove there was a struggle over it . Proof? The police department displayed a host of photographs which they think vindicates their officers at a new conference today . Los Angeles police chief Charlie Beck showed off the images at a news conference, recorded by local channel ABC7, 24 hours after the confrontation. He claimed the images showed that the magazine and slide of the officer's pistol were damaged - and that a bullet had been partially discharged from the chamber. Beck said: 'While on the ground and struggling with the officers the man forcibly grabbed on of the officers' holstered pistols, resulting in an officer involved shooting. 'Photos of the officer's pistol are on my right. As you can see, the slide is partially engaged and a round had been partially ejected and has fouled the firing chamber. 'This is indicative of a struggle over the weapon. As you can also see, the magazine is dislodged from its resting-place. This is also idnicative of force used on a weapon. Shocking footage of the incident showed the man flailing at officers before being pinned to the floor. They try to use a Taser on him - but it seemingly has no effect. Shouts of 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!' can be heard seconds before officers open fire on the prone man. Today police released photographs of an officer's weapon after the confrontation, which they say proves the weapon was involved in a struggle. He also said two of the officers were injured and are now on crutches. Witnesses to the killing immediately said the police were too aggressive dealing with the man, whom they say had mental health issues. The LAPD said he was wanted in connection with a robbery. Justification? LA Police Chief Charlie Beck offered the explanation this afternoon . Killing: This is the moment police fired shots at the homeless man, who is obscured from view in the above frame by an officer. The LAPD have claimed he was trying to take an officer's gun . Doubt was also cast on whether the man actually tried to wrest a handgun from officers; a moment which the footage which has emerged so far does not clearly depict. Police chief Beck today called the killing an 'extreme tragedy' - and implored anybody with video evidence to submit it to police. He added that two of the officers were wearing body-mounted cameras. It came as more information emerged about the drifter, whom friends say came from Cameroon and lived in the U.S. for a decade before coming to LA six months ago.. Referring to him as 'Booth', 'Cameroon' or 'Africa' - references to his home country - fellow Skid Row vagrants say he lived in a tent on the streets and often read the Bible. Pressure for the LAPD to produce evidence to vindicate their officers had been mounting since a video of the killing emerged on social media. The shocking footage shows the man lashing out at police, who force him to the ground. Police first tried to use a Taser on the floored man, but officers say it had no effect. After the stun gun is fired, an officer shouts at him to 'drop the gun'. Seconds later, five gunshots are heard in quick succession. The footage does not show the scuffle clearly. Outraged crowds soon gathered at the scene, accusing the police of unjustly killing him. A police statement on the killing said that 'the suspect and officers struggled over one of the officer's handguns' before shots were fired. But crowds of people who were watching gave a different interpretation of the chaotic encounter. One was Dennis Horne who told NBC's Today program he has his own footage of the incident. When asked whether the man reached for a policeman's gun, he said: 'My footage don't say that, my eyes didn't see that.' Yolanda Young, another bystander, said: 'He didn't bother nobody, he didn't have no weapon, they just shot him.' Jerome Guillory, who also saw the attack, said: 'There was no reason to do that to him, the guy, he wasn't no threat to them.' Another witness, Lonnie Franklin, 53, did not comment on whether the man was trying to shoot back, but said the police's use of force was excessive. Fight: At the beginning of the encounter, the man is seen taking swings at several police officers on Skid Row . Confronted: He was being confronted over reports of a robbery before five shots were fired . He told the LA Times: 'That man never was a threat - the amount of officers present at the time could have subdued him.' Daily Mail Online spoke with a close friend of Africa on Monday, who said the man moved to LA sixth months ago, and had a combination of mental illness and drug addiction problems. Nick ‘KB’ Gee said the man’s real first name is Booth, but people called him ‘Africa’ because he was originally from Cameroon. ‘Booth was trying to get back home to Africa but he didn’t have no money, that’s why he was homeless,’ Gee said. ‘‘I talked to him a lot of days, he was a very respectful, honest man. He didn’t bother nobody, he would sit in his tent reading his Bible. ‘He told me about his family and he said he had to go back home to take care of some things.’ ‘He don’t have nobody out here so I would come down and help him out, get him food, some money, a cigarette,’ he said. Nick said police had responded not because of a robbery but because Booth was arguing with a neighbor who lived in a tent next to his. ‘A lot of guys who know him would have helped calm him down, the police know the man, they talk to him everyday, ask him to take his tent down,’ he said. Friend: Nick Gee spoke to Daily Mail Online about the man who was shot dead . Tributes: Flowers were left by the man's Skid Row tent Monday as people attacked the LAPD for the killing . ‘You’re dealing with a guy with a combination of mental illness and drug addiction, they used over excessive force. ‘They Tasered him and he was scared and tried to run in to the tent, they dragged him out and instead of five cops holding him down they shot him.’ One homeless man who identified by his nickname ‘Juju’ said he was friends with Africa, whom he said he last saw no more than 30 minutes before the shooting. He told the LA Times that he was also was also known as ‘Cameroon,’ for his home country. Juju said they had been chatting about politics the last time they spoke. ‘They did not have to kill my friend,’ Juju said. He said his fellow homeless friend’s problems with police were nothing new. There were arguments most days between Africa and LAPD officers over taking down his tent, Juju said. In memoriam: This carboard plaque pays tribute to the man, known as Cameroon or Africa by locals . ‘He would say, “Ticket me. Give me my day in court,”’ he said. But despite his run-ins with the law, Juju said Africa was a generally peaceful man. ‘He was generous,’ he told the LA Times. ‘He lived in a tent, but he was content.’ The LAPD has its own investigation into the killing, which will 'determine whether the use of deadly force was consistent with Department policies and procedures'. LA County's district attorney's office will also conduct its own probe. Last night, LAPD spokesman Andy Smith insisted that the shots only came after the struggle over a firearm. He told reporters: 'During the attempt to detain him, this individual resisted our officers. Theys struggled with him, they tried to tase him a couple of times.' 'That was ineffective and eventually the struggle occurred where the officers that were struggling with the individual over one of the officer's weapons. Police have not formally identified the man they killed. A spokesman told DailyMail.com that no more information would be released Monday, and that any body cam footage would be held back until after the LAPD's own investigation was over.

"Death Row: Kelly Gissendaner (pictured) is set to die by lethal injection in Georgia at 7pm tonight . The only woman in Georgia on death row is due to be executed tonight at 7pm - after an astonishing last meal of cheeseburgers, fries, ice cream and a fatty salad - unless lawyers can convince officials to spare her life. Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, is due to be given a lethal injection at a state prison in Jackson in retribution for plotting the murder of her husband in 1997. She was sentenced to die after her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death at her urging. Gissendaner, who will be the first female executed in Georgia in 70 years, has also made headlines with her request from prison authorities for a no-holds-barred last meal. The feast includes two Burger King Whoppers, two large orders of fries, cornbread, a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing, popcorn and cherry-vanilla ice cream. However, there is a chance she receive a last-minute stay of execution - if her lawyers convince Georgia's justice system to cancel the killing. Attorneys are mounting a last-ditch attempt to persuade the State Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute her sentence to life without parole. She was denied clemency at a hearing last week, but lawyers argue that extra witnesses from within the prison system could help persuade them. Previous attempts have rested on her remorse and new-found faith. In a statement ten years ago, Gissendaner herself said: 'I deserve to be here, but I don't deserve to die'. Murder: Gissendaner, shown left in her arrest mugshot from 1997, is facing death for plotting the murder of her husband. However, her boyfriend Gregory Owen, right, who actually did the deed, is not on death row and could be paroled within a decade . Monster meal: Gissendaner, pictured above with a regular prison meal, requested an enormous spread including two cheeseburger meals, cornbread, ice cream, and popcorn for her last meal . She has also drawn attention to the fact that, while she did not kill her husband, the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing death - and will be eligible for parole in 2023. If the bid fails, her lawyers are expected to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. It has already denied one appeal. Her execution had been due to take place last week, but was canceled after a winter storm caused disruption in the area. Gissendaner would be the first woman executed in Georgia since 1945 and only the 16th woman put to death nationwide since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976. Gissendaner's lawyers note that the parole board already heard from many people testifying about her faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency. But, her lawyers argue, the board did not hear from many Department of Corrections employees whose perspective 'would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case.' The most important witness the board did not hear from is Kathy Seabolt, who served as her warden for six years, first at Metro State Prison and then at Lee Arrendale State Prison. Locked away: Gissendaner, pictured above in 2004, has been locked up for the past 17 years . Seabolt could testify that former parole board chair James Donald promised Gissendaner would receive clemency, her lawyers wrote. Each time the topic came up in conversations between Donald and Seabolt, 'Donald reiterated his statement that Ms. Gissendaner did not need to worry about clemency as it was a foregone conclusion,' they wrote. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation. Although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings, the reality is less clear, Gissendaner's lawyers wrote. Some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on Gissendaner's behalf, but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden, who succeeded Seabolt last year. 'Under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside the institution. Staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed,' Kathleen Kennedy wrote on Jan. 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial, she had been offered the same plea deal as Owen - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years. 'At one time, therefore, all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for Ms. Gissendaner,' her lawyers wrote. Owen, who is the one who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death, took the deal and testified for the prosecution. Gissendaner balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer's advice to go to trial. The parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants, her lawyers wrote. 'In fact, this Board has on at least four occasions in the past commuted a death sentence of a co-defendant who was not the actual killer of the victim,' the lawyers wrote. Douglas Gissendaner's parents and sisters want her to be executed, but two of Kelly and Douglas' three children have asked the parole board to spare her life, the lawyers wrote. In statements submitted with her clemency application, Kayla and Dakota Gissendaner describe a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness; finally they have a meaningful relationship with their mother. 'We also believe that Kelly's death will not restore them or make them whole,' Gissendaner's lawyers wrote of the entire Gissendaner family.","Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, to receive lethal injection in Jackson at 7pm .

"Drew Peterson, a former suburban Chicago police officer convicted of killing his third wife and suspected in his fourth wife's disappearance, pleaded not guilty today to trying to hire a hitman to kill the prosecutor who helped put him in prison. Peterson's feet were shackled as he waived a preliminary hearing in the court in Randolph County in southern Illinois. He was charged in February with soliciting an unidentified person to find someone he could pay to kill Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow. Circuit Judge Richard Brown also granted Peterson's request for a speedy trial, meaning he would go to trial within 160 days or by July 28. Randolph County State's Attorney Jeremy Walker said the state would ready by July 13. More charges: Drew Peterson, pictured in 2009, is now charged with trying to hire a hitman to kill the Illinois prosecutor who put him in prison. He maintains his innocence . Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow - who pursued the case against Peterson, which was a national sensation - won a conviction in September 2012 . The former Bolingbrook police sergeant has been in prison since he was convicted in 2012 of Kathleen Savio's death eight years earlier. He is serving a 38-year sentence. His fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, disappeared in 2007. Peterson, 61, is charged with solicitation of murder for hire and one count of solicitation of murder, both felonies carrying a maximum sentence of at least 30 years in prison. Last month's announcement is the latest chapter in a case that became a media sensation almost from the day Peterson's 23-year-old fourth wife, Stacy, disappeared in 2007. A massive effort to find her included divers and cadaver dogs searching ponds and thick woods near Peterson's Bolingbrook home. The search was unsuccessful, with Peterson accused but never charged in the slaying of his young wife. Stacy Peterson (left), Drew's fourth wife disappeared in 2007 and was never found. He was convicted in 2012 of the 2004 murder of third wife, Kathleen Savio, who was found drowned in her bathtub . But after Savio's body was exhumed and authorities ruled her drowning a homicide, Peterson was interviewed countless times by news crews and, as the investigation continued, he joked about a 'Win a Date with Drew' contest and discussed appearing on a reality TV show about a Nevada brothel. Throughout it all, Peterson maintained his innocence and his attorneys contended Stacy Peterson had run off with another man and was alive. Drew Peterson did not testify at his trial, but addressed the court after he was convicted, blaming prosecutors for 'the largest railroad job ever' and sarcastically telling Glasgow that the prosecutor could celebrate destroying his life. He challenged the prosecutor to look him in the eye, then told him to 'never forget what you've done here.' Glasgow issued a brief statement after the new charges against Peterson were announced, saying that while it was 'unfortunate that prosecutors sometimes must deal with allegations of this nature,' he would not let a threat to his personal safety affect the way he does his job.","Drew Peterson was convicted in 2012 of the murder of his third wife, Kathleen Savio .

"A heavily pregnant woman and her seven-year-old son have been found shot dead at a home in rural Queensland alongside the body of a 52-year-old male relative in an apparent murder-suicide. Police believe the father's death is not suspicious, while his 27-year-old daughter and her son's death are being treated as suspicious. Three gunshots were heard coming from the home on Sunday night at around 10.30pm but police were not called to the scene until Monday evening. 'There was one shot and then some time difference between the second shot,' Detective Inspector David Isherwood said.

Taylor's influence is now mind blowing - she has 52.8 million Twitter followers and 74.4 million likes on Facebook. Last year, Shake It Off went to No.1 on the iTunes chart in 64 different countries and in January, she sold the four millionth copy of 1989 in the US alone. The new success had coincided with a new Taylor - one who had cut off her long blonde hair into a sophisticated bob, moved to New York and developed a close-knit group of female friends who she frequently hosts dinner parties for at her Tribeca apartment. Perhaps most crucially though, 2014 also marked the year that Taylor Swift was a singleton. Taylor with with the supermodel Cara Delevingne . Taylor with the singer Lorde (left) and Ellie Goulding (right) Since she was 16, Taylor has had a slew of celebrity boyfriends that have all ended in heartbreak. It would be hard not to be aware of her failed romances, given the coverage they have received both in her music and in the news. In her teens, she dated heartthrobs Taylor Lautner and Joe Jonas, before moving on to the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer. There was a brief romance with Conor Kennedy before what has now become her most famous relationship - Harry Styles. Taylor Swift with ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas, who she dated in 2008 . Taylor Swift with Taylor Lautner, who she dated in 2009 . But her dalliance with the One Direction star was enough to put Taylor off men and since her break-up with the singer in January 2013, she has focused on living a single life. She told The Telegraph on Saturday: 'The thing about my girlfriends right now is that none of them needs me for anything other than friendship - I love the fact that they are all passionate about their jobs, whatever their jobs are.' 'I used to think it was important to find a boyfriend, but I don't feel that it is now.' In doing this, the tide has turned for Taylor in terms of public opinion - up until last year, many derided the star for being boy crazy and acting like a crazed bunny boiler. The reputation for being a man hunter also unfairly affected people's opinions about her professional success, which has been almost unprecedented for a singer/songwriter of her age. Taylor with Jake Gyllenhaal (left), who she dated in 2010 and Conor Kennedy, who she dated in 2012 . Taylor with Harry Styles in December 2012 in New York . But with 1989, a new Taylor emerged - the songs were no longer about men and more about her relationships with her peers and the public. Shake It Off was a brilliant two fingers up to the 'haters' who had been criticising her for so long simply for having boyfriends. Taylor's move to New York from Nashville also coincided with a chic new style. For the last 12 months, the star has consistently been photographed on the world's best dressed lists and she even holds her own when out partying with her gaggle of supermodel friends like Karlie Kloss.

Every morning, she leaves her Manhattan loft dressed in an immaculate ensemble that puts most celebrities to shame.

Ellie Goulding and Lewis Hamilton present Taylor Swift with the award for International Female at last month's BRIT Awards . Her feelings of responsibility towards her fans is one of the strongest in showbiz - she researches their hobbies on social media and then buys presents for them that reflect their personalities. According to the Telegraph, she has even been known to help pay off her supporters' student loans. She said: 'Do they like photography? I'll get them an 1980s Polaroid camera. Do they like vintage stuff? I'll go to an antiques place and get them 1920s earrings. Do they work out a lot? I'll get them workout stuff. 'When you actually get to know them on a person-by-person basis, you realise what you're doing is special and sacred and it matters.'

"What do Beethoven, birthday cake and the way your eyes move have in common? They're all conspiring to get you to spend more money when you eat out. While we are all prepared to splash out in restaurants, it's become clearer that restaurateurs have devised crafty ways to make sure we spend more than we had planned to. And while it might not seem unacceptable to charge corkage for when you bring your own wine to an eatery, there are now a number of London restaurants who charge cakeage fees - a sum to serve diners birthday cake - which can sometimes come up to £9 per person. Scroll down for video . Stung by your bill? Restaurants have devised sneaky ways to make diners pay more when they eat out . Not so happy birthday: London eateries are now charging 'cakeage' where diners have to pay to be served birthday cake . From using hyperbole to convince you to order pricier items to drawing your eye to parts of the menu they want you to look at, eateries have devised intelligent ways to ensure that you end up spending more than you planned to. Playing with numbers and omitting dollar and pound signs . Restaurant menus tend to attach prices that end with the number nine to dishes  as it indicates a bargain is being had. For example, a diner would be willing to pay for a dish that costs £19.99 then they would for something which is marked as £20. According to the New York Times, prices which end with .95 instead of .99 are even more conducive to making people spend as they 'feel friendlier' to diners. The publication reported: 'In the world of menu engineering and pricing, a dollar sign is pretty much the worst thing you can put on a menu.' Gregg Rep, a menu consultant in California said to news.com.au: 'Dollar signs remind people of money. When you use dollar signs, your food looks more expensive.' A study by Cornell University's Centre for Hospitality Research, US, found that when dollar signs were left off a menu, sales increased by eight per cent. Kaspar's Seafood Bar & Grill in London's Savoy Hotel (pictured) charges £9 per person for birthday cake . Anchoring . Another key trick is known as 'anchoring'. This is where a restaurant places a highly expensive dish prominently on the menu — solely in order to make the other dishes nearby appear relatively cheap. So the next time you see a £70 steak, look at the item below it, which will seem like a bargain when you compare prices. William Poundstone, author of Priceless: The Myth Of Fair Value Restaurants said: 'Restaurants do not expect to sell many of these costly 'anchor' items. That is not their job — instead they are simply there to make the other dishes look like good value.' Suddenly spending £21 on a plate of lemon sole doesn't seem so outlandish. Identifying body and eye language . Korean studies have shown that diners take an average of 109 seconds to read a menu. So menu consultants have a limited time to make their sell to us, which is why more expensive items of food are always place on the top right hand corner of the page (this is where the eye naturally falls when we look at a page). The most profitable dishes are usually placed there. This subliminal messaging also works in most printed matter, such as newspapers and magazines. Menu boards which omit prices (left) and classical music such as works by Beethoven (right) are some of the ways restaurants make diners pay more for their experience . Tests,which were carried out over three weeks by University of Leicester researchers, monitored the effects of classical, pop music and background silence on spending. They found that when subtle classical melodies were played, diners spent more than £24 per head on average on food and drinks. When pop music was played, less than £22 was spent by each diner and without any background music the spending fell to only £21.70 per head. In the same test, diners were spending over £1 each on coffee with classical music, compared to only 80p with pop music and 54p without any background noise. James Davis, proprietor of Softleys restaurant in Market Bosworth, where the research was carried out, said: 'The sort of music you play does affect people's mood. 'It is quite amazing how much it sets and creates an atmosphere in the restaurant. Sometimes you play what you personally like rather than what the clients like, so I think this research will definitely affect what we play in the future.' Overblown descriptive language . How much would you pay for a chicken nugget? We reckon not more than £2 at most.  But what if you were presented with homemade chicken goujuns in a sesame seed crumb dusted with paprika powder and Himalayan sea salt? Then you might be more inclined to fork out in excess of £7 for what is essentially a jazzed-up McDonald's favourite. The language used when writing a menu indicates the exclusiveness of the dish. This is why we now are now seeing incidences of heirloom vegetables, heritage potatoes and artisan breads popping up in every menu. Sauce is now jus or froth, potatoes are 'lightly crushed' and salad dressing is 'tenderly forked through'. Professor Charles Spence, a psychologist at Oxford University, the co-author of The Perfect Meal: The Multisensory Science Of Food And Dining said: 'There's research that demonstrates that if you give food a more descriptive label, people will enjoy it more — and they'll also pay more for it.' One common example of this is to attach somebody's name to a dish. For instance a lot of restaurants have dishes that include the name of the butchers or suppliers, which makes it seem like the dish has been carefully chosen– and thus justifying the price hike. Manipulation through music . While music may well be the food of love, Mozart, Bach and Beethoven could also burn a nasty hole in your pocket, research has suggested. Scientists have discovered that classical music makes restaurant diners feel more affluent and encourages them to spend more money. The less sophisticated tones of Britney Spears as background music saw people typically spending around 10 per cent less on their meals. Researchers at the University of Leicester found that classical music, often associated with affluence, was the most successful in encouraging people to part with their cash. When no music was played, the amount of money spent by diners was dramatically less. Dr Adrian North, senior lecturer in psychology at the university, said: 'When you hear a piece of music it activates all types of knowledge. If you hear classical music, it has got all sorts of connotations of sophistication, affluence and wealth and it makes you feel a bit posh. 'In a restaurant, this has the effect of making you spend a bit more money. Where people were really spending the money was on the luxury items, such as starters, desserts and coffees.' Cakegate . While corkage fees have become the norm, there is now a trend to charge diners 'cakeage' for when they bring in their birthday cake. Prices can go up to as much as £9 per person at Kaspar's Seafood Bar & Grill in London's Savoy Hotel, which is the same price at dessert. Duck & Waffle in London, charges £7 per person serving charge although their staff inform punters that they can provide a cake if you would rather that. Fork out £45 for a medium or £65 for a large cake, depending on the size of your group. Other restaurants charging cakeage include Gordon Ramsay's Savoy Grill and Maze restaurants in London, which demand £5 a head, and barbecue chain Bodean's, charging £1.50. But some restaurants are still keen not to spoil the party. Chain restaurants including Pizza Express, Byron, Wagamama, Wahaca, Jamie's Italian, Carluccio's and Nando's do not charge diners for bringing their own cake. Claridge's bar in Mayfair does not charge cakeage 'as long as it's not a five-tier cake that has to be wheeled in on a horse'.","Tricks include using only numbers to indicate price of dishes .

"The secret of how the legendary Star Wars spaceship the Millennium Falcon was built has been revealed - in a high-security project codenamed 'Magic Roundabout' in the Welsh countryside. The only full-size model of Han Solo's iconic craft was constructed at an aircraft hangar in Pembroke Dock, west Wales, where workers were sworn to silence over what they were making. Newly released photographs show dozens of joiners, welders and metal-platers at work during the three months they spent putting together the giant freighter flown by Harrison Ford in the famous science fiction series. Scroll down for video . Engineering foreman John Clark and two friends are pictured beside the life-size Millennium Falcon model in a newly released photo of the project . The distinctive shape of the Millennium Falcon is clearly recognisable in the second photo taken by Mr Clark . A group of workers go over the plans for the massive spaceship during its construction at Pembroke Dock . It was built inside an aircraft hangar with workers involved in the project sworn to secrecy . The huge prop was made inside an aircraft hangar which had been home to the Sunderland flying boats during the Second World War. The giant steel doors were kept shut from morning until night to hide the construction - there were no unauthorised visits, photographs were banned and the workers were sworn to secrecy. But one amateur photographer managed to get a snap of the 'fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy' as it was nearing completion. The never before seen picture shows how the Millennium Falcon earned its wings in the town of Pembroke Dock. John Evans, a historian in the town, said: 'Star Wars has a global following and this is yet another great reason for tourists to come here. 'Pembroke Dock is a military town and we have people coming from far and wide to follow family footsteps, be it Navy, Army or Air Force. 'But there is also this incredible link to Star Wars which is almost a cult thing and a 21st century concept. 'People can still see the very building where the Millennium Falcon was made.' The photograph was taken by local man John Clark, a foreman with Marcon Fabrications, a heavy engineering firm that serviced the UK's petrochemical and oil industries. Work on the model (pictured) finished in 1979 and it was transported to film studios in Hertfordshire . Mr Clark recalled: 'One of the directors was in cahoots with someone with the studios or someone associated with the Star Wars films. 'I was very surprised that we'd gone that type of work because we built stuff for the oil industry and the offshore industry, but we got the contract. It was just a reasonable size team of workers that built all the framework. 'I was foreman on the job at the time. When we built it - as you can see on the photographs - we had it on hover pads on the legs so that it could be moved as though it was going to take off and so forth. 'We tried to keep it as much a secret as possible because you didn't want everybody prying and coming round the hangar, but it got out. People were prying and trying to see what was going on but half of them didn't believe it, saying: ""Building a spaceship? That's rubbish"".' He said the Millennium Falcon was then disassembled into pieces so it could be transported to the studios in Hertfordshire. 'The artists in the film industry, the craftsman, went to work on it and made it into what you see on The Empire Strikes Back.' This rare photograph was taken during the top-secret project which was codenamed Magic Roundabout . Work on the spaceship finished in 1979 and the prop was then transported to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire . The company had been asked by filmmakers to build a life-sized, moving prop for key scenes in the second Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back. And Mr Clark used his pocket-sized 110 camera to get a colour photograph of himself and two friends standing next to the Millennium Falcon. Work on the spaceship finished shortly after the picture was taken in 1979 and the prop was transported to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. The film was released in 1980 and was a box office smash around the world. This was followed up by the third film in the trilogy, 1983's Return of the Jedi. A permanent exhibition of Star Wars photographs, artefacts and memorabilia is being opened to celebrate Pembroke Dock's links with the iconic movie franchise. Mr Evans added: 'This has been a huge thing for us. 'This is great for tourism and a very unique claim to fame for Pembroke Dock.' Han Solo's much-loved Millennium Falcon (pictured) has taken a unique place in pop culture . In the 38 years since it first appeared on the big screen, the space ship piloted by Han Solo and his Wookiee assistant Chewbacca in the original Star Wars series has become an easily recognizable piece of pop culture. Armed with laser cannons and the famed 'hyperdrive' technology, it featured in the first movie A New Hope and went on to become a regular setting throughout the series. Such is the high esteem in which fans hold it, the exact specifications of the model, its weaponry, shielding systems and engines have all been meticulously documented. The ship is technically a light freighter measuring 111ft in length by 82ft wide. While it is rounded and flat in shape, it measures 26ft high - inclusive of the attached exterior weaponry. Its maximum speed is 1,050kmph. But this is vastly surpassed when it goes into 'hyperdrive' - a mode illustrated in the films when the stars surrounding it appear stretched or blurred as it travels through light years within the space of hours. The ship is powered by five different engines - primarily a 'Quadrex power core' and four backup or emergency generators. Its main weapons are 2G Quad Laster cannons and a hidden ground-defence blaster cannon, though many other improvised weapons make brief appearances in the films. Capable of carrying six passengers, it is crewed by two people - those usually being Han Solo or Chewbacca - with provisions for two others to man guns during space battles. The ship was piloted by Harrison Ford's character Han Solo (right). Here he pictured next to Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia and Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker .

"Scott Hoyle, 48, is on trial accused of killing a former Royal Marine who died when an alleged stunt in a vintage Tiger Moth aircraft went wrong . A former Royal Marine pilot killed his passenger after crashing his aircraft while performing a 'foolish and dangerous' loop-the-loop at a low height, a court has heard. Scott Hoyle, 48, allegedly carried out the acrobatic manoeuvre in his Tiger Moth plane, despite passenger Orlando Rogers being too big for the move to be carried out safely. The court heard how Hoyle, described in court as a novice, was 'reckless' for attempting to perform the stunt at a height 'at which recovery was improbable'. Hoyle's 'risk-taking' allegedly caused the plane to nose-dive into a field near Witchampton, Dorset, killing Mr Rogers. The 26-year-old was a former Royal Marine who served in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland. Hoyle, from Broadstone, Dorset, also suffered serious injuries during the crash, from which he has since recovered. He denies manslaughter and endangering the safety of an aircraft. Opening the case at Winchester Crown Court, Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution case is that the fatal crash was caused as a result of conscious risk-taking by Scott Hoyle, in that he flew the aircraft in a way which created an obvious risk of serious injury to Orlando Rogers, and Scott Hoyle either chose to disregard it or was indifferent to it. 'The prosecution submits that what he was intending to do was plainly dangerous and created an obvious risk of serious harm.' Mr Bowes told the jury of six men and six woman that, at 18st 7lbs and 6ft 2in, Mr Rogers' size placed restrictions on how the aircraft should be manoeuvred, something Hoyle should have known and made the flight unsafe. He said Hoyle had flown 35 hours in the aircraft, making him a 'novice' in it, and that he was not trained to perform the loop-de-loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting. The jury was told the flight was the second Hoyle had flown from the Compton Abbas airfield in Dorset that day, having taken another friend up in his plane earlier. Mr Bowes said he had successfully completed several loops with the other passenger and that GPS tracking suggested he crashed near where these previous acrobatics had taken place. 'The location of the fatal manoeuvre and the improbability of Scott Hoyle's own account of the loss of control, and evidence from eye witnesses on the ground, all point to the fact that this was indeed an attempted loop,' said Mr Bowes. The plane crashed into a field near Witchampton, killing Mr Rogers. The 26-year-old was a former Royal Marine who served in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland and ran a maritime security company . Hoyle had flown 35 hours in the aircraft, making him a 'novice' in it. He was not trained to perform the loop-de-loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting, the court heard . The court heard how the pair took off from the airfield at about 2.49pm, with the weather described as 'a pleasant spring day'. The fatal crash happened a short time later, at 3.08pm. Hoyle, who had a private pilot's licence, had flown 184.8 hours at the time of the crash, but only 35 hours in the Tiger Moth, making him 'inexperienced' in it. Mr Bowes described to the jury how eye-witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft attempt a loop manoeuvre just before the crash. The plane, built in 1940, then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first. Mr Rogers was sat in the front seat of the plane, with Hoyle behind him . 'The prosecution say eye-witnesses saw the aircraft entering a loop,' said Mr Bowes. 'That point is absolutely disputed by the defence, who say it never happened. Thereafter the aircraft entered a spin from which it did not recover.' Eye-witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft attempt a loop manoeuvre just before the crash. The plane, built in 1940, then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first, the court was told . Mr Bowes said Hoyle had 'no formal training in aerobatics.' He also told the jury the plane was flying too low to attempt a loop manoeuvre. When interviewed, Hoyle claimed he lost control of the aircraft due to 'a control restriction.' He said that following a left-hand turn, the rudder remained to the left. Hoyle told investigators who launched a probe into the flight that he pulled back on the stick in an attempt to regain control of the aircraft, which may have made it appear as though he was performing a loop. During his interview, Hoyle said he understood an aircraft needed to be at 3,000ft to 3,500ft to recover from a spin. However, Mr Bowes said the plane had been much lower than that when he performed loops earlier with his previous passenger, Nicholas Diamond. 'The prosecution case is that it was an attempted loop and it was far too low because when the plan got out of the loop it was too low to do anything about it,' said Mr Bowes. After the crash, horrified bystanders dialled 999 and paramedics and fire crews rushed to the scene to help. Emergency teams spent around an hour cutting away the fuselage at the front of the plane so they could free Mr Rogers. Mr Rogers, who was in 'a very bad way', was flown to Dorchester Hospital on a coastguard helicopter. Hoyle was also taken to Dorchester Hospital for treatment to his injuries. Mr Rogers was pronounced dead later that day. A post mortem examination showed he died as a result of multiple injuries. The court heard from an expert, who told the court it was 'reckless' of Hoyle to attempt a loop manoeuvre at the height he was flying. Although GPS data of the final seconds of the flight was lost, it did show he was flying 1,423ft above the ground moments earlier, thousands of feet lower than he should have been before starting a loop. Hoyle had previously 'dangerously' performed loop manoeuvres far below the height a novice should have been doing them. Emergency teams spent around an hour cutting away the fuselage at the front of the plane so they could free Mr Rogers. He died later that day at Dorchester Hospital . The jury has been told inexperienced pilots, such as Hoyle, should be no lower than 3,000ft after completing a loop-the-loop. Mr Bowes said GPS data showed that on a flight on February 12, 2011, the former Royal Marine dropped to 393ft above the ground when apparently performing a loop. Aviation expert Geoffrey Connolly told the court that the heights at which he was performing the acrobatic stunts were described as unsafe and 'plainly not simply foolish, but dangerous'. Reading his expert report, Mr Bowes said Mr Connolly believed it was only 'a matter of luck' that Hoyle had previously performed loops successfully. Mr Connolly said it was 'beyond belief' that Hoyle was unaware of the guidance on the height at which aerobatic manoeuvres should be performed. He said: 'To attempt a loop at such a low height with his limited level of experience was quite simply reckless in my opinion.' Mr Connolly believed Hoyle's explanation that the spin had been sparked by a jammed rudder was 'not credible'. The expert concluded that what Hoyle was doing before the crash was a 'deliberately attempted loop'. Mr Bowes said: 'He was clearly aware of the recommended height limitations for aerobatic manoeuvres and yet chose to disregard them, possibly encouraged by previous experience, having done it at that very low height. 'Mr Connolly's view is that...what he was attempting to do was plainly dangerous and created a serious risk of harm to his passenger, Orlando Rogers.' On previous occasions tracked by the GPS, Hoyle was also flying lower than he should have been even when not performing manoeuvres, the jury was told. According to the GPS data, Hoyle performed loop-the-loop manoeuvres in his three previous flights before the fatal crash - twice on February 12 and once earlier that day. In each case, the aerobatics were performed above the Manswood area, near where the deadly crash occurred, the court heard. On the day of the crash, the data showed that in the first flight Hoyle was flying at 1,000ft before dropping to 409ft, apparently after doing a loop. Mr Bowes said the data proved Hoyle was going back to the area where he had previously performed loops, even if it did not show he was doing one before the crash. 'This occurred in the same location that the aircraft carried out other aerobatic manoeuvres on all three of the previous flights,' said Mr Bowes. 'He was going back to Manswood to do what he did at Manswood, which was loop de loop.' The jury was shown photographs of the wreckage surrounded by emergency crews. An investigation into the fatal crash was carried out by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. The court heard that the investigation had found no sign of malfunction with the plane's rudder. Mr Bowes described how the Tiger Moth was a training plane used by the RAF until 1952 and 4,000 were built in the Second World War with many still in use as recreational aircraft around the world such as the one involved in the accident which was built in 1940.

"Teenagers taking GCSE science will no longer have their practical work assessed through coursework, it was confirmed yesterday. The exams regulator Ofqual is pressing ahead with the reform despite fierce opposition from many in the science community. Universities have argued that that those entering undergraduate courses needed tried and tested basic skills to study at a higher level. GCSE science students will no longer have practical work assessed through coursework. Pictured, David Cameron and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan watch a science experiment at a school earlier this month . Education Nicky Morgan has also publicly criticised the move, recently saying it was ‘in danger of holding back the next generation of scientists.’ But Ofqual has insisted that the change will ‘liberate’ teachers from repetitive practicals and offer more variety to pupils. Under the proposals, there will be no separate exam specifically covering the lab work students have done, but instead there will be written exam questions that will draw on what students have learnt. This will count for at least 15 per cent of the total marks available. Each exam board offering science GCSEs will have to specify a minimum number of practical experiments a pupil must take part in and this number will be no less than eight in each individual science and 16 for combined science courses. The move means that practical science will no longer be assessed through ‘controlled assessment’ - a type of coursework completed in the classroom. Education Nicky Morgan has criticised the move, saying it was ‘in danger of holding back the next generation of scientists’ Schools will also have to confirm that students have completed a range of experiments and each pupil will have to keep a record of their work. Ofqual chief Glenys Stacey said: ‘There is unanimous agreement among scientists that practical work is central to good science qualifications. ‘We have consulted widely and have identified a new approach to the assessment of practical science that will liberate teachers to offer a wider variety of classroom experimentation and promote effective student progression to further study or employment.’ A document on the plans says that students who do not do practical work will still be able to achieve science GCSEs, but insists that these young people ‘are likely to find it challenging to achieve the highest grades without having the relevant practical experience’. Confirmation of the changes comes in the wake of strong opposition to a similar overhaul of A-level science. Morgan’s criticism will be the first major test of Ofqual’s independence after it was set up in 2010 as a non-ministerial government department. Mrs Morgan said in a letter to Ofqual yesterday that while she appreciated the ‘reasoning’, she still harboured reservations. She wrote: ‘I continue to share the concerns of many in the science community that not having an assessment of practicals as part of the GCSE risks undermining the teaching of practicals in schools. ‘It is important you take all possible steps to mitigate that risk.’ She called for the situation to be monitored to ensure that pupils are still undertaking a range of practical activities. She added: ‘I would also expect – as I am sure you are planning – arrangements to be put in place to evaluate the impact of the approach when it is implemented in schools: with a commitment to revisit the decision if the evidence shows the approach to have had a detrimental effect.’","Pupils will no longer have practical work assessed through coursework .

"A Ukip candidate had to be rescued from high tides at the party's annual spring conference after writing a note on the beach proclaiming his love for leader Nigel Farage. Sam Gould, 31, the party's Caerphilly candidate, was pictured being hauled out of the water onto a breakwater by press officer Gawain Towler when he became trapped after jumping a wall to scrawl the doting message in the sand. The debacle began after he hastily jumped down onto the beach early Saturday morning to write a response to protesters. After jumping down onto the sand to write the message, Caerphilly Ukip candidate Sam Gould realised he was trapped by the tide . Press officer Gawain Towler (right) then intervened to help pull him up a seaweed-covered breakwater . With Mr Towler's help, he managed to avoid getting wet - although the press officer said lifting him 'wasn't the easiest' Mr Gould poses beside his message in the sand at Margate which reads 'We love Nige' The message was written on the beach on Saturday at Margate during the party's annual spring conference. Mr Towler told MailOnline that Mr Gould - 'the enterprising chap that he is' - decided to scrawl the message in the sand in response to messages left on the beach by protesters the previous day. 'Basically it was about 7.30 in the morning and the previous day some Green activists had scribbled some rude stuff in the beach. Ukip leader Nigel Farage was said to be amused when he saw the message and heard about his candidate's struggle to get off the beach . 'I knew nothing of this and I was pottering around the conference hall and I saw the snappers take off looking purposeful.' Following the commotion, he stumbled across Mr Gould hurriedly scrawling the message in the sand. But it was after he finished writing the note and proudly posing for photographs that he found himself in trouble. Mr Towler added: 'Basically, he'd gone down and didn't realise there was no exit because the tide was too far in, so I helped him out. 'It was actually quite hard because that whole breakwater that I pulled him up from - top to bottom - was covered in seaweed. It wasn't the easiest yank I've done.' However, he did say party leader Nigel Farage managed to see the amusing side of the debacle. 'He just smiled at it. He wasn't there at the time, he arrived a bit later and he saw the scribble on the beach and just laughed.' Mr Gould told Wales Online: 'I jumped the wall - it was about six to seven feet high - and wrote a message myself in the sand, which said ""We love Ukip"" and then ""We Love Nige"".'

But an instrument called Moxie - the Mars Oxygen In-situ Resource Utilisation Experiment - could provide a solution. It will attempt to turn carbon dioxide on Mars into oxygen when it is taken to the red planet by a new Nasa rover in 2020 - and it could be a precursor to similar technologies on manned misisons. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is creating an instrument for Mars. Called Moxie (shown here in this illustration) it will attempt to turn the planet's carbon dioxide into oxygen. It will be taken to the red planet by a new unnamed Nasa rover in 2020 . Speaking to Business Insider, former astronaut and principle investigator for the instrument Dr Jeffrey Hoffman explained the project. ‘It will be the first time when we will actually produce oxygen on the surface of Mars,’ he said. This next-gen vehicle is the successor to the Curiosity rover, with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine Mars' rocks. The rover will assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of Martian life. It will identify and collect a collection of rock and soil samples, which it will be able to send back to Earth intact, via another spacecraft one day in the future. Dr Charles Elachi, director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has previously said that collecting a rock sample and bringing it back to Earth is Nasa's top priority. Scientists are particularly interested in the samples so they can understand the hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how oxygen can be created - details important to consider for human missions to Mars and the future colonisation of the planet. The rover marks the next major step in fulfilling President Obama's challenge of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. The atmosphere of Mars is 96 per cent carbon dioxide and less than 0.2 per cent oxygen, but the team hope to convert the former into 99.6 per cent pure oxygen. To do so, it gathers carbon dioxide from its surroundings and isolates oxygen atoms, then combines them to make O2 - breathable air. On this occasion, together with the by-product of carbon monoxide, the gases will be released back into the air. But proving the technology works would have important implications for future missions - and not just for breathable air, but fuel as well. ‘Ultimately, the idea is that Nasa would send both an empty rocket and a larger version of Moxie to Mars, before a planned human mission,’ writes Jessica Orwig for Business Insider. ‘The oxygen-producing machine would take about a year and a half to fill the rocket with enough liquid oxygen for lift off. ‘Then, when astronauts arrived, they would have a rocket fueled up and ready for launch to take them home.’ Nasa’s Mars 2020 rover is a planned £1.2 billion ($1.9 billion) roving laboratory, similar to the Mars Curiosity rover currently on the planet. Moxie was selected from 58 instrument proposals from research teams around the world. If the technology can be proven, it would greatly reduce the weight of a future mission to Mars - 75 per cent of a manned Mars mission would be taken up by oxygen, or equipment carrying it. The atmosphere of Mars is 96 per cent carbon dioxide and less than 0.2 per cent oxygen, but the team hope to convert the former into 99.6 per cent pure oxygen. This could then be used for breathable air on future manned missions (illustrated) or even fuel to get them off the surface .

"A visionary project has been approved which will see Australia’s largest solar farm constructed in Queensland in a staggering $1 billion project. The impressive development promises to be 100 times bigger than the country’s current largest solar farm and potentially, the largest of its kind in the world. The plant will be located on a 5,000 hectare acre site at Bulli Creek on Queensland’s Darling Downs and promises to produce enough clean power for 550,000 homes. The south-west Queensland project is expected to begin construction in 2016. It is hoped that within eight years the solar farm will be generating two gigawatts of power; a massive figure which is more power than any coal station in Queensland is currently capable of producing. Westlands Solar Park is 20 mw solar farm constructed on brownfield land in California. The solar farm development, set to be built in Queensland, will be 100 times bigger . After seven years as a barrister, Angus Gemmell established Solar Choice, a solar project broker and consumer comparison service, which was the driving force behind the proposal . ‘This will be a wonderful example of what Australia can make from our natural resources, space and sunshine,’ Angus Gemmell, managing director of Solar Choice, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Australia is wonderfully geared to some visionary projects to harness those benefits of cheaper, bountiful, reliable sources of power,” Mr Gemmell told the Guaridan. Mr Gemmell was formerly one of Australia’s top defamation lawyers and won some of the country's most high-profile cases. In 2006 he won a case which saw NRL player Mark McGaw awarded $385,000, which is the largest ever damages figure handed down by a judge, after a Today Tonight program accused McGaw of domestic violence. Gemmell also represented political figures, including defence intelligence chief Frank Lewincamp. After seven years in his profession Gemmell established Solar Choice, a solar project broker and consumer comparison service, which was the driving force behind the proposal. With Gemmell at the helm, Solar Choice campaigned for 18 ‘exhaustive’ months until approval was finally granted three weeks ago. The Toowoomba Regional Council referred to the Queensland State Government before the game-changing project was given the go-ahead. The Bulli Creek Solar Farm will be built toward full 2GW capacity in ‘manageable steps’ over a number of years. With Gemmell at the helm, Solar Choice campaigned for 18 ‘exhaustive’ months until approval was finally granted three weeks ago . ‘We have optionality reserved to build over time, up to eight years. This means we are able to break it down into manageable steps,’ Mr Gemmell told Daily Mail Australia. Solar Choice have located one of a very few locations which meet all requirements. ‘It’s wonderfully positioned, close to major transmission nodes in the national electricity grid. It’s on large-scale, cleared flat country. All aspects make it for an aspiring study,’ Mr Gemmell told Daily Mail Australia. The area is also ‘soaked in sunshine’ due to ‘good sun hours’ and has no neighbours. There are no ecological restraints. Crucially, the Bulli Creek site is close to a 330 kilovolt substation near Millmerran, operated by Powerlink. This ensures the solar power will be able to reach Australians across the nation. The next step will be for Solar Choice to work with Powerlink for six to nine months to determine how to connect the solar farm to the grid. The project has already garnered the interest of a number of crucial investors. ‘Investors are well-advanced in the project. A number of North American and European-based parties are certainly very excited by the solar farm. The interested parties already have experience with similar, very large-scale solar projects. ‘No one has finally signed up but they have completed due diligence on the project.’ The project has already garnered the interest of a number of crucial investors. However, investors require legislative certainty from the government regarding the renewable energy target before they come on board . However, investors require legislative certainty from the federal government regarding the renewable energy target before they come on board. The Abbott government wants to redefine a renewable energy target (RET) set by a previous centre-left government in 2009. The government promised that 20 percent of projected energy use would be renewable by 2020. However, the current government wants to aim for 20 percent of actual energy use, which is far less. To reach the target, the government subsidises companies which invest in renewable energy as well as households and small businesses which opt to use such energy. Changing the current mandate could potentially deter investors. But the cost of renewable energy is higher than the subsidies, so companies pass on costs to customers. The government and opposition are now negotiating new terms of the RET in a review that is expected to last a year. ‘We have placed this project on the radar at all levels of politics,’ Gemmell told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We are helping to show them that there are alternatives. There is conjecture at a federal level that there is not enough of a pipe line in Australia. ‘However this project would be considerable way to help achieve the target (20 per cent of projected energy use). ‘It is proof that there is enough of a pipeline in Australian to reach the target, not to fall short of it.’ The solar farm is forecast to take Australia 25 per cent closer to achieving the current target, 41,000 GWh. by 2020.

"Former PM Tony Blair was given an award for his 'global legacy' by Save the Children last year . Save the Children has apologised over its decision to give Tony Blair an award for his 'global legacy' after a furious public backlash. Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision, but insisted it was only meant to mark his work in Africa and not his entire time in Number 10. Mr Forsyth, a former Downing Street aide, admitted it would have been 'wrong' to give an award to the former PM for his political legacy rather than for his work on international aid. Mr Blair was handed an award for spending billions of taxpayers' money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year. The former PM, who set Britain on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas aid, was given the charity's Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership in international development. But the award sparked widespread fury when it was announced in November. More than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the award to be rescinded and around 500 Saved the Children staff members have reportedly backed a similar petition. Questioned about the award on the BBC's Today programme this morning, Mr Forsyth said: 'I know that many of our supporters and volunteers were very upset and our staff, several of our staff too, and I'm very sorry for that.' He said the decision had been made by the British charity's 'sister organisation' in the US and insisted the award was only for his Africa work. Mr Forsyth said: 'Yes, it was a global legacy award. It was called that. But actually it was an award very, very specifically for Tony Blair's efforts on Africa at two G8 summits at Birmingham and Gleneagles, not his wider legacy. 'And if it had been for his wider legacy I think it would be wrong, but it was for something quite specific that helped Africa and children. 'I'm sorry it's upset so many people. It's not really what we do at Save the Children. What we're really doing is on the ground in Syria with the Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone – that's the work we do. 'This has been really an unnecessary distraction. I do apologise to those people that it's upset.' Justin Forsyth (left), the charity's chief executive pictured in Lebanon with Samantha Cameron, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision to honour Tony Blair . Mr Blair was handed the award for spending billions of public money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year - also attended by Mike Bezos (centre left), Dakota Fanning (centre right), and Nicholas Kristo (right) Mr Forsyth admitted the row had 'in part' damaged the charity in eyes of some staff but expressed hope people would accept organisations 'make mistakes'. Mr Forsyth was recruited to Number 10 by Mr Blair to help with work on poverty and climate change. He then became one of Gordon Brown's senior advisers before joining Save the Children. As prime minister, Mr Blair set up the Department for International Development and hosted a series of aid summits. Critics say Britain's foreign aid budget – which hit £11.4billion last year – has led to a string of perverse outcomes, including spending millions in countries such as India which can afford its own space programme. Accepting his award last year, Mr Blair said: 'From the beginning of humankind there has been brutality, conflict, intrigue, the destructive obsession with a narrow self-interest. 'But throughout all human history, never has been extinguished that relentless, unquenchable desire to do good. To act not only in self-interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it.' At the time, a spokesman for Save The Children said: 'The UK's achievement of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international aid in 2014 is the culmination of work started under [Mr Blair's] leadership.'","Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said he was 'very sorry'

"A Michigan man convicted of fatally shooting a nine-year-old boy, who witnessed him kill two other men, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole. Deonte Isaac Gray, 19, was given the sentence on Monday after previously being found guilty on three counts of first-degree premeditated murder charges. He was convicted of the 2013 shootings involving Trashawn Macklin, a young boy who reportedly saw the killings of James Allen Jr., 25, and Akeem Easterling, 23, at an apartment in Flint. Scroll down for video . Deonte Isaac Gray (above during his sentencing on Monday), 19, from Michigan convicted of fatally shooting a nine-year-old boy, who witnessed him kill two other men, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole . Gray was convicted of the shootings involving Trashawn Macklin (right), a young boy who was present during the shootings of James Allen Jr., 25, and Akeem Easterling, 23, at an apartment in Flint (left, Macklin's mother, Andrea Washington, holds a picture of him with 'RIP' written across the top) A fourth murder charge against Gray was dropped after a witness disappeared. During the sentencing, Macklin's mother, Andrea Washington, had tears filled in her eyes as her son's Freeman Elementary School teacher Laura Garrison stood beside her. Garrison told Gray his actions took away a young boy who was loved by everyone he ever touched, according to MLive. She said she always tried to warn Macklin to avoid and walk away from potentially hostile situations. The teacher, said: 'Unfortunately, he came across the same person we tried to protect him against.' James Allen Jr.'s mother, Antoinette Moore, told Gray in an emotional statement that her son did not deserve to be taken away like that. James Allen Jr.'s mother, Antoinette Moore (above during her emotional statement), said through sobs that her son did not deserve to be taken away like that . Gray was given the sentence on Monday for three counts of first-degree premeditated murder charges (above Janette Allen, a sister of one of the victims, cries in court) Moore said of her son: 'He was a good person. He was.' The shootings were not Gray's first run-ins with the law as he previously was convicted of felonious assault and second-degree home invasion at the age of 15 in 2010. Gray was sent to live at the Shawono Center in Grayling, a 40-bedroom facility to treat male juveniles from age 12-21 accused of one or multiple felonies, before he was moved to another facility, Murack Lodge, according to court records. The incident leading to his recent sentencing unfolded on July 15, when Gray reportedly got into an altercation with Easterling. A shoving quarrel between the two men was ended after Gray shot Easterling before he then went to the apartment to tell Allen about the fight. The shootings were not Gray's first run-ins with the law as he previously was convicted of felonious assault and second-degree home invasion at the age of 15 in 2010 (above family members cry during the sentencing) However, when he noticed Allen reaching for a gun in the nightstand, he shot him too, according to police. As he was leaving the apartment, he realized Macklin had witnessed the shootings, and fired the gun at the boy. Tips from police eventually led to his arrest and he was found in a relative's attic. Gray, during his sentencing, did not give an apology to the families of the victims, but did thank the court for its time.","Deonte Isaac Gray, 19, was sentenced after being convicted on three counts of first-degree premeditated murder charges .

"Savannah Guthrie has taken over Brian Williams' spot on NBC Nightly News as Lester Holt deals with a family emergency. The 43-year-old Today host has filled in a number of times in the past when Williams was ill or on vacation. Guthrie was among the few tipped to take over permanently from disgraced Williams when he was suspended for allegedly fabricating anecdotes about the Iraq war. However Guthrie, a former attorney who joined NBC as a legal analyst in 2007, cannot accept the spot as she is contracted to present Today until 2018. Scroll down for video . Savannah Guthrie took over on Nightly News on Monday night (pictured) after Lester Holt had to deal with a family emergency. The 43-year-old Today host has filled in a number of times in the past when Brian Williams, who is currently suspended, was ill or on vacation . Replacement: Holt (left) has been raking in viewers to NBC's flagship news show after he stepped into the role for disgraced anchor Brian Williams (right) who allegedly fabricated anecdotes about his time in Iraq . According to Deadline, Hoda Kotb will temporarily take Guthrie's spot as producers grapple to find a solution to boost their viewer ratings that are trailing ABC's Good Morning America. Guthrie's time in the anchor chair was unlikely to be permanent as Holt has been having no trouble reining in the audiences. Viewer ratings shot up by more than half a million viewers on his second week filling in for suspended Williams. NBC's newscast averaged 10.1 million viewers in the second week of February, roughly 600,000 more than the week before, the Nielsen company said. Holt, 55, has been with NBC News since 2000 and before that worked as a news anchor in Chicago for 14 years. Besides being Williams' chief sub for the past two years, he co-anchors Dateline NBC, Weekend Today and Nightly News on the weekends. He's been placed in a uniquely awkward position, asked to right the ship for a company desperate to get out of the headlines, not knowing whether it's a temporary position or one that could become permanent. 'It's tough,' said veteran news executive Rick Kaplan, once Holt's boss when he was MSNBC president. 'He has to be very careful, because until Brian's future is outlined very clearly, Lester is just doing the network a favor in a way.' He called Holt a wise choice for the role. Holt has unassailable credentials, works hard and does the job without drawing attention to himself, Kaplan said. Locked in: Guthrie, pictured with chef Todd English and Holt, is contracted to present Today until 2018 . 'What NBC needs is quiet competence, and Lester has that in abundance,' Kaplan said. 'Lester is someone everybody can be proud of. He is somebody the people of NBC News can be proud of and rally behind, because that's what they need right now.' Holt is choosing to keep his head down and do the job, not speaking publicly about his role. He's an accomplished bass guitar player, but he's not going on entertainment programs to show his chops or swap stories about the news business. Williams could lose his job if bosses decide he has brought himself into disrepute after it emerged he falsely claimed he was in a helicopter that came under fire while in Iraq. An investigation has been launched into his reporting, especially the Iraq incident, which he said happened while covering the war in 2003. The probe is also looking into his reports about seeing a body floating by during Hurricane Katrina and his presence at the fall of the Berlin wall. Williams (pictured arriving for Letterman's show in 2013) is being investigated by NBC News . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Berlin Wall, 1989 . Tom Brokaw was historically the only American anchor present at the fall of the Berlin Wall. But during a 2008 forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Williams claimed he was at the Brandenburg gate 'the night the wall came down.' And although in a 2004 interview Williams said he arrived at the wall 'a day after -- more like 12 hours after -- Tom Brokaw did,' at a gala in 2014 he stated: '25 years ago tonight Tom Brokaw and I were at the Berlin Wall'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update. The 55-year-old faces the possibility of being fired because of a 'morality clause' in his contract that says his role can be terminated if he brings himself into disrepute. Williams, who has been the nightly news anchor for 10 years, had recently signed a $10 million, five-year pact, Page Six reported. The defining clause in his contract said: 'If artist commits any act or becomes involved in any situation, or occurrence, which brings artist into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which justifiably shocks, insults or offends a significant portion of the community, or if publicity is given to any such conduct . . . company shall have the right to terminate.' Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken Williams' place. The show has seen a significant drop in viewers since Williams was taken off air. In a statement, NBC chief executive Stephen Burke wrote: 'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate.' His claims came to light after a show was broadcast, featuring Williams describing how in 2003 he had survived his helicopter being shot down by a rocket propelled grenade. His account was challenged by people who were in the actual craft that was hit and it emerged the NBC anchor was in fact in another helicopter entirely, around an hour behind the targeted helicopter.","Today host, 43, has been lined up to temporarily fill in for Lester Holt .

"Veteran BBC DJ Paul Gambaccini has accused the police of launching a 'witch hunt' against innocent celebrities to cover up their failures over Jimmy Savile. The 65-year-old said he had suffered 'a year from hell' as officers tried to drum up their case against him after he was arrested in 2013. He was finally told he would not face any sexual assault charges in October. Mr Gambaccini also claimed he had been 'left out to dry' on bail for months longer than necessary because the police did not want people to see a former Radio 1 DJ cleared before their case against his former colleague Dave Lee Travis had concluded. Scroll down for video . The 65-year-old veteran DJ Paul Gambaccini said he had suffered 'a year from hell' by officers trying to drum up their case against him after he was arrested in 2013 . Mr Gambaccini told the Home Affairs Select Committee the police had launched a 'witch hunt' to protect their reputation . Travis was convicted of molesting a 22-year-old researcher in September, just weeks before the case against Mr Gambaccini was dropped. Mr Gambaccini blamed his arrest on the 'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Savile which exposed the police's own failures to stop the prolific paedophile. 'I faced the full weight of the state with unlimited financial resources for 12 months for no reason - it was a completely fictitious case,' he told the Home Affairs Select Committee. He said: 'Someone whose identity we do not know, who I call the Wizard of Oz, the person sitting behind the curtain, pulling the levers, setting off smoke and light shows, decided ""I've got a great idea, let's have a witch-hunt, let's divert the attention of the public from the police who knew about but failed to stop Jimmy Savile in his lifetime and shine that spotlight instead on his contemporaries and we'll get perverts from show business in the 1970s and 1980s''.' The furious BBC DJ added: 'When you open a website and a phone line - as the police did - for the dedicated purpose of accusing celebrities, then you are going to get some people who are responding to the offer of money and attention.' He told MPs there was no excuse for his treatment and urged them to overhaul the law to protect innocent victims from spending months on bail. 'It's obvious they wanted to keep me in the frame, because my name got out to the press '[but] there is no possible excuse for leaving someone out to dry.' He added: 'You don't need a witch hunt to enforce the law.' He also accused the Crown Prosecution Service of carefully timing the extensions of his bail to coincide with big sex abuse cases, such as the Rolf Harris trial, in order to avoid public scrutiny over their flimsy case against him. Mr Gambaccini blamed his arrest on the 'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Jimmy Savile which exposed the police's failure to tackle abuse over decades . Mr Gambaccini told MPs he was 'left out to dry' until the end of the case against Dave Lee Travis. He also said he was re-bailed to coincide with the case against Rolf Harris (right) While Mr Gambaccini was making the accusation it emerged Harris had been stripped of his CBE, awarded to him by the Queen . The 84-year-old Australian was awarded the CBE in 2006 for his services to entertainment but it has now been retracted following his sentencing to six years in prison after being found guilty of sexually assaulting girls as young as seven-years-old. Mr Gambaccini said he had lost faith in the British justice system and revealed he had lost £200,000 in wages and legal fees after his arrest. The US-born DJ was re-bailed several times during his ordeal – and only found out about one after it had been reported to the BBC and ITV. Mr Gambaccini accused the CPS of having 'sat on the case' for eight months and said he 'enthusiastically' supports 28-day bail limit. He said the only reason for delay is to 'get someone else to accuse you'. Mr Gambaccini had his bail extended  when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for indecent assaults . He told the committee that during that time, his bail was extended on seven occasions with only 'vague' explanations from police, but he gradually realised that the dates often coincided with important developments in the Yewtree investigation. Bail was extended on May 2, when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for historic indecent assaults, on June 30, hours after the conviction of Rolf Harris and on September 12, when former Stoke Mandeville doctor Michael Salmon appeared in court charged with rape, he said. 'You know what they say. Twice is a coincidence, three times is a trend,' said Mr Gambaccini. 'It was kind of interesting when I was rebailed the same day Max Clifford was sentenced. It was kind of infuriating when I was rebailed the same day Rolf Harris was convicted. But then when I was rebailed again when Michael Salmon was charged, I thought 'OK, what they are doing here is trying to bury the news of my being rebailed forever, because if anybody wanted to write an article about Yewtree on those days, it wouldn't be about me, it would be about the other suspects'.' When his bail was extended to September 15, he suspected a link to the trial of Dave Lee Travis, which was due to end on that date. 'I thought, 'This is the most obvious thing in the world. They are sitting on me until they are finished with Travis, because they don't want the Travis jury to know that a former Radio 1 DJ can be innocent'. 'I do believe - though I don't have any evidence for this - that they were just sitting on me until Travis was finished,' he said. The veteran disc jockey told MPs that no one was above the law, but said celebrities were more vulnerable to false allegations because more people know them. He added: 'This person went after me because I was the famous person in his neighbourhood.' After dropping their case against him, the CPS revealed that the allegations against him involved two underage boys who were around 14 and 15. Other celebrities including comedians Jim Davidson and Jimmy Tarbuck have had their names dragged through the mud after Yewtree investigated them over decades-old allegations. Paul Gambaccini accused the police for launching a 'witch hunt' against innocent celebrities . Dubbed the Professor of Pop for his encyclopedic knowledge of music, Paul Gambaccini had been a BBC radio DJ for 16 years when he was arrested last year. The 65-year-old, who is openly gay, was born in New York. He gained citizenship to the UK in 2005 despite starting with with the Corporation in 1973 as a reporter on John Steel's Radio 1 show, Rockspeak. He read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University as well as studying at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Despite his success, Mr Gambaccini said he was victim to homophobic treatment within the BBC where his personnel file was reportedly marked with a Christmas tree as he was 'camp as Christmas'. He entered into a civil partnership with model Christopher Sherwood in 2012. Following an ITV documentary in 2012 which exposed the depraved paedophilia of Jimmy Savile, Gambaccini publicly condemned the Jim'll Fix It star, describing him as 'an enigma'. 'He was not all good, he was not all bad, he was an enigma.,' he said on Daybreak. 'You just didn't mess with Jim. 'He was the governor, because after all he had been the first great club DJ, he had been the originator of Top Of The Pops and you just let him have his turf. 'And none of us were interested in going there. 'At social occasions we would all be together, but Jim would not be. He had his own life,' he said on live television. He added he had been waiting for 30 years for the public to be made aware Savile's abuse. 'I've been waiting for this to come out for 30 years, but then he did raise millions for charity. 'This comes out when he's dead because he had an imperial personality in showbiz, and I'm not talking about personal life.' 'Once he was phoned and he said, 'Well, you could run that story, but if you do there goes the funds that come in to Stoke Mandeville Hospital. 'Do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations?' And they backed down.'","Veteran DJ  said he had suffered 'a year from hell' after arrest in 2013 .

Join me by wearing my new lipstick for Red Nose Day. Worn by me and my supermodel friends Cara Delevingne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Cindy Crawford.' Kate has given her signature lipstick a charitable makeover and it comes complete with a dotty red and black lid . At that point, funnyman David Walliams appears on the set dressed in various guises, which show a remarkable likeness to the trio of catwalk stars. In his incarnation of Cara he wears a leather jacket with a beanie hat and a collection of gold chains. Acting up for the camera, he can be seen smudging his lipstick, eating make-up and pulling wacky poses. As he larks around in high-energy mode, he also depicts her destroying the set with her antics. As Marks and Spencer beauty Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Walliams opts for a more feminine approach, which sees him gliding around in a bra and knickers. However, perhaps the funniest impression of them all is that of Cindy Crawford. While strutting around in a skin-tight dress and huge wig, he shows off a hilarious - and hairy - over-sized mole on his face. Speaking about their charity campaign, Kate Moss said: 'We are all hoping that people will make their face funny for money, please buy the lipstick put it on your nose, put it on your cheeks, make yourself look like a clown and raise some money.'

The pair are inseparable and always make sure to spend every moment together when Jamie's not touring. The musician previously cited 'missing my family' as the worst part of gigging. The couple also raise daughter Lila Grace, 12, who Kate has with her ex-partner Jefferson Hack. 'My wife is very much my sidekick,' Jamie previously told The Mirror. 'So I tend to get separation anxiety when I’m away from her.' The pair have been lying low since enjoying a wild weekend break with their famous friends including Noel Gallagher, Nick Grimshaw and Sadie Frost. They jetted off to Scotland to celebrate nutritionist and former model Rose Ferguson’s 40th birthday with a Burns-themed bash at the Craigellachie Hotel on the banks of the River Spey. Wearing a while silk top with black lace detail over the top, he encapsulated Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's frequent pouting and posing .

"John Bercow claimed a massive repair and modernisation programme was needed  to ensure the Palace of Westminster remains safe and useable . The Houses of Parliament may have to be abandoned if £3billion repairs are not done, the Commons Speaker warned last night. John Bercow claimed a massive repair and modernisation programme was needed within a decade to ensure the Palace of Westminster remained safe and useable – otherwise, it could close within 20 years. Speaking in Westminster, he said it would be a 'huge pity' if MPs had to 'abandon the site' because it had become unsafe. But he said keeping the Houses of Parliament 'fit for purpose' would require a 'not inconsequential sum of public money' within the next decade. He said: 'This is a fabulous institution located in awesome surroundings. It must not have the ethos of a museum. 'It will require bold, imaginative leadership to ensure we are a Parliament fit for purpose and this Victorian legacy can be rendered practical for contemporary representation.' Referring to the blaze that burned down the old palace of Westminster in 1834, Mr Bercow said: 'It would be a huge pity if we decided that by the time we had reached the 200th anniversary of the vast fire which consumed the old parliament and brought this one in to being, we had to abandon this site and look elsewhere in order to serve the public interest properly. 'Yet I will tell you in all candour that unless management of the very highest quality and a not inconsequential sum of public money are deployed on this estate over the next 10 years, that will be the outcome.' The cost of repairing the Houses of Parliament could top £3 billion, an examination of options for renovating the historic building has suggested. Mr Bercow said £3 billion was 'a realistic scenario' and added that Liberal Democrat MP John Thurso, the spokesman for the House of Commons Commission, 'may even say that that's on the cautious side'. The Speaker said he was 'very uneasy about the idea of decanting' from the Palace of Westminster while the work was carried out because 'once you are out it can be very difficult to get back' and the pressure to get on with the refurbishment would be reduced. Mr Bercow said: 'If we were to decant, should we consider all options including, almost certainly, a regional option? We should.' The cost of repairing the Houses of Parliament could top £3 billion, an examination of options for renovating the historic building has suggested . A 2012 report found that  asbestos was present throughout the palace and original roofs were no longer watertight, leading to extensive damp, leaks and floods . Any decisions would have to be made by the whole House of Commons, Mr Bercow said, and the sums of money involved would require Government funding. A 2012 report found that basic services within the building, like electricity, water and sanitation, were being kept functioning 'with increasing difficulty and growing risks', while asbestos was present throughout the palace and original roofs were no longer watertight, leading to extensive damp, leaks and floods. The present building - home to Houses of Lords since 1847 and the Commons since 1852 - has had no general renovation since repairs of wartime damage in 1945-50, said the report, adding: 'If the palace were not a listed building of the highest heritage value, its owners would probably be advised to demolish and rebuild.' In a speech to the Hansard Society, Mr Bercow also defended his own 'controversial' approach to the Speaker's job, which has led to accusations of bias from some Tory MPs. He said he had been determined to 'test the elasticity of the office'. 'I do not think even my worst enemy would deny that I have done (that),' he said. 'That I have been a controversial character at times, I freely concede. Yet if controversy is the price of being the agent of change frankly I consider that to be a bargain worth striking.'","John Bercow said it would be a 'huge pity' if MPs have to 'abandon the site'

"Drilling has begun beneath a German city by a team of Indiana Jones pensioners who believe they are on the trail of the fabled Amber Room of the Tsars. The OAP treasure hunters are digging beneath the streets of the old industrial city of Wuppertal. The Amber Room - valued at around £250million in today's money - was looted from the palace of Peter the Great in Soviet Russia by invading Nazi troops in 1941. It is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from World War Two never to be found and has captivated treasure hunters ever since it was first plundered. Some say the panels were destroyed by Soviet artillery fire on the Prussian city of Koenigsberg, others that they were dumped in an Alpine lake by the SS in the closing days of the war. But Karl-Heinz Kleine, 68, and his bowling club pals, say they have proof it was entombed by the Nazis beneath the streets of Wuppertal. Scroll down for video . Digging for treasure: A team of Indiana Jones pensioners being drilling under the German city of Wuppertal, where they are convinced the Amber Room is hidden after it was looted by the Nazis from Russia in 1941 . Lost art: The Amber Room seen in all its glory in 1930 before it was stolen from the Catherine Palace . The city is riddled with subterranean bunkers and tunnels dug by the Nazis. It is here, said Kleine, that he has received information that the crates arrived from Koenigsberg early in 1945 to be hidden. He said: 'Erich Koch, the Nazi gauleiter of East Prussia who died in a Polish prison in 1986, came from Wuppertal. 'As the Red Army closed in on Koenigsberg, he ordered the treasure to be packed up and brought back to his hometown. We have studied records and spoken to people from the time. 'He did not want to leave the world's greatest treasure in a region with an unknown political future; rather he brought it to a place he knew where he had a good chance of accessing it in the future. In his own backyard.' In search of lost treasure: A group of bowling club friends say they have proof the Amber Room was entombed by the Nazis beneath Wuppertal . Following the scent: The group claim to have received information that the crates arrived from Koenigsberg early in 1945 to be hidden in the German city of Wuppertal . Opulent: A complete restoration of the Amber Room in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg, the original of which was plundered by the Nazis in World War Two, but has since disappeared . The £250million room, consisting of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin, took ten years to complete. It is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from World War Two never to be found . The local authority have given Karl-Heinz and his four friends permission to dig in the Nazi structures and a local building firm has loaned them some heavy drilling equipment. 'I can't reveal who our sources are, but we are not doing this for fun,' he added. 'We will find the Amber Room here.' Others have been just as certain in the past. The Maigret author Georges Simenon founded the Amber Room Club after World War Two to track it down once and for all. Everyone had a different theory of what might have befallen the work. Plundered: The remains of the Amber Room after it was seized by the Nazis, who packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to Germany, where they vanished never to be seen again . Stripped bare: Some say the panels were destroyed by Soviet artillery fire on the East Prussian city of Koenigsberg, while others claim they were dumped in an Alpine lake by the SS in the closing days of the war . Destroyed: Peter the Great received the room as a gift from the King of Prussia in 1716 and brought it to his new capital, St Petersburg. Here it is seen before restoriation . The Amber Room consists of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin, took ten years to complete and is valued at some £250million in today's money. Peter the Great received the room as a gift from the King of Prussia in 1716 and brought it to his new capital, St Petersburg. The 16-feet of jigsaw-puzzle style panels were constructed of more than 100,000 perfectly fitted pieces of amber. In 1755, it was moved to the Catherine Palace at Tsarkoe Selo, 17 miles south of the Imperial Russian capital. In 1941, the approaching Nazi army surrounded the city, then known by its Soviet name of Leningrad. Tsarkoe Selo was one of the outlying areas occupied by the Germans. They packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to Germany, where they vanished. Dozens of theories have been put forward for their whereabouts and in some cases, millions spent trying to unearth the treasure, but as yet nothing has been found. In 2006 an American team spent £7million diving into the glacial waters of Lake Toplitz in Austria. Norman Scott, the founder of Global Explorations, said he had a witness who he says specifically counted 27 crates going to the waters of the lake in April 1945, one month before the capitulation of Nazi Germany. Paperwork from the RHSA - the Reich Main Security Office of the SS in wartime - shows the Amber Room was packed into precisely 27 crates before it was taken away by the Germans from Russia. The team also say the Cyrillic lettering on the remains of a wooden crate they found, bearing the words 'fragile' and numbered could mean it once contained a piece of the Amber Room jigsaw. Lake Toplitz was used by Hitler's forces in the last two years of the war for secret underwater experiments using dynamite and rockets. It later turned it into a dumping ground for anything the Nazis wanted to hide from the advancing Allies. But the lake has yielded little since WW2, except for forged £5 notes which were printed by the Nazis and intended to cause chaos for the British economy. In 2011, a book published in Germany claimed the room lies hidden in old mine workings in a forest in east Germany. 'The Puzzle of Poppen Wood' by Mario Ulbrich unleashed a fresh wave of treasure hunters who arrived at weekends with shovels, metals detectors and vast reserves of optimism to scour for the artwork. Casualties of war: Inhabitants of Leningrad (now St Petersburg) flee after a German bomb attack in the winter of 1941 when the Nazis seized the Amber Room during their assault on the city . The Catherine Palace in St Petersburg (as seen in 2010) where the Amber Room is housed . Ulbrich interviewed foresters, policemen, miners and old Nazis for his work which chronicles two decades of largely unreported quarrying in the wood near Zwickau. Matthias Gluba, a civil engineer and hobby historian on WW2, has triggered another Amber Room frenzy after researching wartime records of the town of Auerswalde near Chemnitz. Auerswalde was the place where Hitler built the two biggest guns in history - Dora and Gustav - both mighty railway mounted monsters capable of hurling shells weighing tons. As he probed into the history of the cannons he discovered plans for secret underground workings. Then he found details of a clandestine shipment from the city of Koenigsberg - now Kaliningrad and part of Russia but in 1945 the main city of Germany's province of East Prussia - which was the last known storage place of the Amber Room before it fell to the Red Army. Art haul: The room was plundered by Adolf Hitler's Nazis during the Second World War . Prussian count Sommes Laubach, the Germans' 'art protection officer' and holder of a degree in art history, supervised the room's transport to Koenigsberg Castle from the Soviet Union. In January 1945, after air raids and a savage ground assault on the city, the room was lost. Gluba found documents about an air raid on the marshalling yards of Breslau - then German, now the Polish city of Wroclaw - on 4 February 1945. The army report stated that 40 wagons from Koneigsberg, which had fallen days earlier to the Red Army, were undamaged in the attack and were moving down to Auerswalde 'under conditions of the greatest secrecy.' Gunter Richter, now 80, is an Auerswalde resident who told Glube that, as a child, he remembered in the Muna Forest outside the town a massive shelter built for munitions works employees that he went into as a boy. It vanished off of maps after the war but in March 2011 he and Gluba managed to find a ventilation shaft that leads down into a subterranean structure they believe is the old shelter. They, and others, have still not managed to access it. Many Amber Room purists believe the treasure lies in the Jonas Valley in what was the former German Democrat Republic. It is the most dangerous of the hunting grounds and draws scores of illegal searchers every weekend. The centre of the Jonas Valley is at Ohrdruf and was the site of the S-IIIFuhrer headquarters. It is a tunnel system many miles in length with thousands of caves, bunkers and storerooms. It was intended to be the Alamo of the Third Reich leadership. Americans liberated it and US authorities have since classified all 1945 documents relating to Ohrdruf for a minimum of 100 years. 'Like no other place in Germany this wild canyon has ignited the fantasies of an international league of conspiracy theorists and treasure hunters, 'wrote Der Spiegel, Germany's top news magazine. Both above and below ground, the area is littered with shells and bombs big enough to destroy a city block. At weekends authorities play cat-and-mouse with the treasure hunters who enter the sealed-off area illegally in ones and twos - and sometimes in mini-bus groups - armed with metal detectors and a belief in the stories. Fortune hunter Martin Stade, author of 'Amber Rooms In Thuringia And Other Hollow Spaces,' likes to guide treasure seekers through the Jonas Valley. Stade believes that Hitler had UFO-like flying saucers developed in bunkers at the site - as well as using one of the chambers as a repository for the Amber Room.","£250m room was looted from palace of Peter the Great by the Nazis in 1941 .

"A daredevil Swiss wingsuit flyer has jumped off the side of a mountain in pitch darkness and flown down past huge pillars of rock using only the light from two bright red flares. And the amazing night-time flight by Patrick Kerber, 33, was not only captured on video, but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer Christian Meier. In the picture Kerber's route appears as a glowing red line running down from the top of the 10,000-foot Titlis mountain in the resort town of Engelberg in central Switzerland to the bottom. Scroll down for video . The amazing night-time flight by Patrick Kerber, 33, was not only captured on video, but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer Christian Meier . Kerber used two superheated emergency flares on the descent down the 10,000-foot Titlis mountain . The daredevil pictured at the moment he leaped into the darkness from the summit of Titlis . And just to show how dangerous jumping with the wingsuit was, Kerber made the flight during the day, showing how a wrong turn would easily have sent him crashing into one of the rocky crags that he was flying close to as he hurtled down from the mountain top. He said: 'I wanted to do a wingsuit BASE flight at night during winter for a very long time. But somehow I never really managed to do it.' The idea became reality when they decided to try and do a single photograph on a slow shutter speed and at the same time fit a light to the jumper so that the flight down the mountain could be recorded. The first problem was that it was difficult to find a light that was bright enough to be seen from a distance of one mile away, where the camera needed to be placed. They solved it, though, by using two superheated emergency flares. These also provided some light to help illuminate the way, although the intense heat also posed a risk that they might set the suit on fire. Patrick said: 'We used flares exactly like the ones used for rescue missions or emergencies. But flares burn very, very hot and my biggest fear was burning holes or melting the suit. That would have been super dangerous. To show how dangerous the jump was, Kerber did a trial run in daylight . A slight mistake would have sent Kerber crashing into craggy rocks . The wingsuit jump produced a dramatic video, with Kerber zooming down the mountain at breakneck speed . 'There definitely was a lot of pressure. Even though we did intense testing before, I did not know for sure how it would turn out. Having fire really close to you on a wingsuit BASE flight leaves no margin for error. Everything has to be worked out.' The two photographers, Fabian Wyss and Meier, stood on the other side of the valley on the Furrenalp to take the snap. Patrick also had to wait until the torches burned out before he could open the parachute. He said: 'I definitely did not want to open up my parachute with fire still around me, as this could be very dangerous. I only have one single parachute attached to me. If this one burns or melts, it's over!' Kerber decided to use two torches. The first one he ignited before he took off and held in his right hand so it would be visible to the photographer. When the torch burned out, he opened up his parachute and when it was safely in the air, ignited a second torch attached to his foot. He said: 'I only had 20 seconds to ignite the second one as it also burned for one minute and I only had 1 minute and 15 seconds to the landing area.' Patrick Kerber has jumped at night before, but not in winter and only at full moon. He said: 'The feeling was very intense and amazing. It is much harder to orientate yourself, as you can't see as well. It feels much more intense because you fly with more feeling and awareness of your body and movements.'","Wingsuit daredevil Patrick Kerber jumped off a 10,000-foot Swiss peak .

"A young father-to-be was crushed to death after a parking barrier swung into his car, just hours after he had told his family he was expecting his first child with his girlfriend. Will Page, described as a 'car fanatic' by his family, was driving out of an industrial estate in Ilkeston in Derbyshire when a parking barrier swung into the windscreen of his van, trapping him and crushing him to death. The 22-year-old apprentice engineer had been repairing a car on the industrial estate when the accident happened on Saturday. His girlfriend Rachael Cross, and mother of their unborn child, described him as 'just amazing' and said it was a 'dream' for her partner to become a father. Will Page had been celebrating with his family the news that his girlfriend Rachael Cross (left) was pregnant with their first child, when hours later the car enthusiast was crushed to death by a parking barrier . Just hours earlier on the previous day Mr Page had been celebrating with his family after he revealed that his 21-year-old girlfriend Rachael Cross was eight weeks pregnant with their first child. She was due to have her first scan yesterday. Mr Page's father Brian said: 'One minute he was telling everyone he was having a baby and over the moon - and the next this happened. 'He loved kids and being a father was everything he wanted. Everyone said he would have been a great dad.' Mr Page frequently met up with other car fanatics at Wyvern retail park in Derby during the weekends. On Sunday evening about 90 cars took part in a procession past his Derbyshire home and beeped their horns in his honour before gathering at the retail park, writing messages to put in lanterns and releasing them into the sky. His father added: 'From front to back, the cars went on for two-and-a-half miles. I stood outside and watched them all come past. He would have been over the moon with that. Mr Page was said to be looking forward to the birth of his first child with girlfriend Rachael Cross (right) Flowers have been left at the industrial site in Ilkeston where the parking barrier (right) swung into his van . 'It was truly astounding and so emotional. It made me feel so much better because he was loved by so many. 'Will was such a happy-go-lucky child, right up to his death, forever smiling and laughing. 'He was the typical joker type of lad and would do anything to cheer people up. 'You couldn't find a better son, mate, brother or leader - he was well-thought-of by so many people.' On Monday Miss Cross posted an image of her eight week scan on Facebook and said their 'little fighter has a strong heartbeat, even after all this stress.' Miss Cross said she had paid for the private scan so that the image could be buried with her partner. She said: 'He was absolutely amazing and I just loved him so much. 'It was a complete dream for him to be a dad and obviously I'm still going to make that happen. 'He was just so happy and never put a downer on your day. I keep expecting him to walk through the door and say 'what's everyone moping about for?''' The couple met in 2013 over their mutual love of cars and have been living with Mr Page's father but saving up to buy their own home. Miss Cross added: 'He was brilliant with kids and would have been a great dad. Mr Page's father said the young apprentice engineer was a car fanatic and would have been a good father . Miss Cross shared a picture of her eight week scan on Facebook on Monday - two days after Mr Page died . 'We spoke about becoming a family one day and when he found out I was pregnant he was absolutely over the moon.' She said the last thing her boyfriend had told her was that he loved her. 'We hadn't been trying for a baby but we had talked about it,' said Miss Cross. 'Will just said if it happens it happens and when I found out I was pregnant he was delighted and it felt like it was meant to be. On the Saturday morning when the accident happened he'd left me in bed at eight o'clock while he went off to do up his car. 'His last words to me were 'love you, bye' and off he went.. That was the last time I saw him. I was having a lie in and I got a call from one of his friends at about 11am saying Will had been in an accident. 'To be honest I just laughed because he was always playing jokes on me pretending he'd cut his finger off at work and I thought it was another prank. When his friend told me he was serious I rushed down to the scene but it was too late. The paramedics were doing CPR on him but he'd passed away. The Health and Safety Executive is investigating how the parking barrier swung into Mr Page's windscreen . Flowers have been left at the scene of the accident following the young apprentice's death on Saturday . Mr Page's friends left flowers, cuddly toys (left) and a t-shirt (right) in tribute to the tragic 22-year-old . Some left bottles of cider and items to remember Mr Page (left) while others placed notes and flowers (right) 'He'd been going in and out of the industrial unit all morning. The barrier was one where you're supposed to bolt it back when you go through but Will hadn't done that. When he came out of the unit to get another part for the car a big gust of wind blew the barrier and it went straight through the windscreen. 'There was nothing anyone could do.' Mr Page had been carrying out repairs on his Peugeot 106 GTI when the accident took place. He had been in a work van and was driving out of the site when the barrier crashed through the windscreen, trapping him in the vehicle and crushing him. Firefighters, police, paramedics and the air ambulance were called to the scene, but Mr Page was pronounced dead at 11.15am. The Health and Safety Executive is investigating how the accident took place. Mr Page has two brothers - Callum, 25, and Harry, 18 - as well as 27-year-old sister Laura. His friend Lee Harris, 28, of Ilkeston, worked with him for about five years at A&D Plastics in Digby Business Park. He said: 'It is not something you expect to hear. When I found out he had been involved in an incident, I walked up there thinking he had broken his leg. You do not think the worst. Mr Page had been repairing his Peugeot 106 at the Ilkeston industrial site before the apparent freak accident . 'It was when I found out he was trapped that I realised it was bad. He was a great lad, I always got on with him and he one of those people you bond with through work. My brother Daniel was his best mate. They did everything together; fishing and holidays.' Dave Harris, who knew the apprentice through his nephew Lee and working with him at A&D Plastics, said he was often known by the nickname 'little Will.' He told the Nottingham Post: 'He was always mucking about with his cars - he was really into his cars. 'We called him little Will because he was so small until he was about 16 and then he sprouted up.' Andy Wilmott, managing director of WB Power Services where the 22-year-old worked, said: 'He was a lovely lad and everyone here is absolutely devastated. Flowers have been left by friends and relatives at the scene (left) where Mr Page (right) died on Saturday . 'He was a trustworthy guy and very infectious. He had a lot of friends here and a lot of people liked him.' A spokeswoman from the Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland Air Ambulance confirmed Mr Page died at the scene after suffering chest injuries. She said: 'We are not sure how it happened. The barrier went through the windshield and crushed him.' A man who works at the garage where Will was repairing his car said: 'We're not entirely sure what's happened but he was driving out when he was hit by the barrier. 'It might have been the wind that caught the barrier and swung it into his van.' A fundraising page has been set up to raise money for Mr Page's funeral and has already raised £2,400 in his memory in just two days.","Car fanatic Will Page had just told family he was expecting his first child .

Martin Pickering, 38, attempted to take a photo of the driver of the Arriva bus in Derby he had boarded after he refused to give him his name when Mr Pickering questioned him about the price of the journey for himself and his daughters, aged six and eight. But the driver was clearly angered by Mr Pickering's attempts to take a photograph and lunged at him, sinking his teeth into his chest. Mr Pickering, who is 6ft 10ins tall, said: 'When you get on a bus you don't expect you to end up being someone's lunch. 'I mean, who bites people? I was so taken aback. I couldn't believe it had happened.' The driver of the double decker bus has been cautioned by police and Mr Pickering has been awarded an out of court settlement. Mr Pickering was travelling back from a day out in Derby with his daughters,to his home on the outskirts of the city. He claims the driver on the number 45 bus charged him around £1.50 more for the outbound journey than he paid for the tickets on the way into the city. Mr Pickering sent his daughters to sit on the top deck and then claimed he attempted to reason with the driver who refused to give him an explanation. He said: 'He charged me a different price from the way into town. 'I was asking him for an explanation, but he couldn't give me one and was just being grumpy and mumbling. Mr Pickering was paid an out of court settlement of £1,500 after the bus driver lunged at him and bit him . 'I asked him for his details but he wasn't really saying anything. 'I couldn't see his badge so I took my phone out and I thought to myself that a photo of him would be just as good to take to the company. 'But he put the engine off, and it turned the lights off on the bus, and he started to get his paperwork together and he put his hand up and he knocked it out of my hand. 'It went to the floor. 'Then he bit me. He bit me on the boob. Mr Pickering was bitten by the driver of a number 45 Arriva bus as he rowed over the ticket price in Derby . 'He was only 5ft 10 and I'm 6ft 10. I assume if we were the same height he would have bitten higher.' Security officers then boarded the bus and the police were called. A spokeswoman for Derbyshire Police confirmed the driver was arrested the following day on suspicion of assault and was cautioned. Martin hired solicitors who have now secured a £1,500 out of court settlement following the incident in December 2013. A spokesman for Arriva said: 'Arriva Midlands carried out a full and thorough investigation into this serious matter at the time and took appropriate action as per its policies and procedures.'","Martin Pickering boarded an Arriva bus in Derby with his two daughters .

"A father of two young children who inspired millions of parents across the world with his blog posts about 'finding Heaven on Earth' has died from lung cancer at the age of 42, it has emerged. Oren Miller, a stay-at-home father to Liam, six, and four-year-old Madeline, was diagnosed with terminal cancer last May after suffering from shortness of breath and severe pain in his back. Tragically, he and his wife, Beth Blauer, from Owing Mills, Maryland, were told the disease had already spread to his liver, his lymph nodes and his brain. He was given only a year to live. Mr Miller, whose 'A Father and a Blogger' site was hugely popular among parents, battled stage four cancer for nine months, before succumbing to it on Saturday, his family told the Baltimore Sun.

He was given only a year to live . An inspirational figure: Mr Miller (pictured), whose 'A Father and a Blogger' blog was hugely popular among parents, battled his cancer for nine months, before succumbing to it on Saturday, his family said on Monday . A funeral service was held for him at Sol Levinson & Bros. Funeral Home in Baltimore on Monday afternoon. His death has also inspired hundreds of online tributes from fans and other bloggers. In one of his most prominent posts on his blog following his cancer diagnosis, Mr Miller told his thousands of readers: 'I believe in Heaven on Earth, and I believe it's found anywhere you seek it.' He continued: 'I found Heaven on long car rides with the kids', adding that he used daily trips to school to 'chat' with his children about their worlds, music, life values and, of course, 'nonsense'. And he said that he 'found Heaven on the dirty floor of a basketball court', where he would pass the ball back and forth with his then-two-year-old daughter as they waited for Liam to finish school. In a separate post, he wrote: 'We all know I will be loved until my last moment by people it has been my utmost privilege to know: by a wife I adore and two kids I'm in awe of every single moment.' In addition his inspirational blog, Mr Miller set up a Facebook page, 'Dad Bloggers', shortly after the birth of his son. The page currently has more than 1,500 members from over 15 countries.

They raised more than $13,000 for his medical care in just 24 hours. As word of his condition spread, they ultimately raised more than $36,000 for the Miller family,TODAY Parents reported. Mr Miller previously told the news site: 'I’ve always said that the group is not me, it’s whatever people put into it. But I’m equally as happy to see that people appreciate what I did, I guess.' Incredibly, the fathers within the 'Dad Bloggers' community rallied again when they learned that Mr Miller and his wife were forced to miss a Billy Joel concert in New York's Madison Square Garden. They recorded themselves covering  Joel's songs from their kitchens, bathrooms and even garages, before posting a compilation to YouTube. Some played the piano, while others played the guitar.

Using the hashtag #Dads4Oren, they have shared their memories of him. In an online post, Australian blogger Dadinator wrote: 'Men don’t talk enough. It’s why we’re more likely to suffer mental illness. Why we die younger. Why we are more likely to take our own lives. 'Oren was a man who talked, who talked about the importance of talking and who shared himself and his journey as a father. But he was more than that, he built a community of men who talk.' Another blogger, Brent Almond, wrote on his Designer Daddy site: 'One of Oren’s greatest passions was for the words of modern fathers - regardless of the size of their audience or the strength of their voice - to be heard in a Facebook group he has built, maintained and supported.'","Oren Miller, 42, passed away from terminal lung cancer at 42 on Saturday .

"A five-year-old boy asked why 'Santa' never visited him despite being good after he was seriously neglected by his mother and her partner. The young child had severely rotten teeth, with several having exposed roots and abscesses, while there was no toothbrush suitable for his use in his house. Authorities were alerted to the boy's plight after he escaped from the house and his frantic mother rang the police. York Crown Court, pictured, heard that the young boy had several teeth removed due to decay . When police arrived at the house, officers found it was covered in flies, with piles of rubbish and rotting food. The kitchen was full of dirty plates while there was dogs excrement inside the house. The fridge was full of rotten food. York Crown Court heard that the boy's school had warned his mother and her partner of their concerns over his welfare. Prosecution counsel Aisha Wadoodi said several of the child's baby teeth had exposed roots while some teeth had developed abscesses. Several of his teeth needed extraction. Ms Wadoodi told the court that after the child was recovered, he was placed into foster care. The court heard that the child's education standards and speech were considerably below the average for his age. According to The York Press, the child told his foster mother: 'Santa doesn’t come to my house. I don’t know why, because I have been good.' The court heard that there were no toys in the boy's room and he had no idea what a bath was for or how he should be washed. York Crown Court heard that the child wanted to know why Santa never visited despite being 'a good boy' Ms Waddodi said that over the past six months, the boy has thrived in foster care, described by his foster mother as 'a lovely little boy, very chatty, open and likes to please people.' She said that the boy does not mention his family or his previous home. She added: 'This was serious long-term neglect.' The boy's mother, who is 43, and her 42-year-old partner have both pleaded guilty to two charges of child cruelty by not seeking dental care or providing suitable living accommodation. The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, recently moved into the property. The court heard that the boy had been neglected between September 1, 2013 and August 2014, while the man had neglected him between March and August. The mother's defence team claimed she was a loving and caring parent who was suffering from depression. She said the mother received no support from the boy's father. Victoria Smith-Swain, for the woman claimed she had difficulty coping with rearing her son and working in a shopping centre. The court adjourned sentencing so it could assess reports of the mother's mental health. Her partner has not yet provided his mitigation statment. The pair are due to be sentenced next month at Leeds Crown Court.","The five-year-old boy ran away from home and was found by police .

"New ruling: All EU countries will have to cut the use of throwaway ‘plastic poison’ carrier bags by 80 per cent following a vote yesterday . All EU countries will have to cut the use of throwaway ‘plastic poison’ carrier bags by 80 per cent following a vote yesterday. The decision represents a victory for Daily Mail readers and the ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign, which launched in February 2008 with the backing of groups from the National Trust to the Campaign to Protect Rural England. Member states have set the 28 countries of the EU a deadline of 2025 to meet the target which can be achieved through the introduction of bans or charges. The UK is already on course to meet this target following decisions by the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which have already have a system of charges. England is set to follow suit with a 5p levy on the plastic bags in October after supermarkets failed to meet pledges to reduce bag numbers through voluntary schemes. All profits from the charges in England will go to good causes, which will include a raft of green clean-up groups, tackling green spaces, rivers and beaches, as well as other charities. Similar charging schemes in Ireland have led to a reduction of around 90per cent in the distribution of the flimsy bags, which have become a blight on streets and parks. Volunteers at the Marine Conservation Society have been working tirelessly to clean beaches and protect sea life such as turtles, which are known to eat the bags because they mistake them for jellyfish. Their work has been supported by money raised through a 5p charge on bags by Marks & Spencer, which led the way among retailers in tackling the blight they cause. Pollution and litter expert at the MCS, Dr Sue Kinsey, welcomed the EU vote, as a ‘useful first step’ in the reduction in single use plastic bags. However, she said an original plan for mandatory charges throughout the EU had been watered down with a decision to leave it up to each member state on how to achieve the promised 80per cent reduction. Bizarrely, the UK government was among those that opposed the idea of a mandatory charge across all EU states. The MCS is also concerned that the bag charge scheme for England will not be as effective as those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This is because it carries various exemptions, including a decision not to apply the 5p fee in small shops. An estimated 100 billion carrier bags are used every year in Europe - with 8 billion ending up as litter. Many of those end up in seas and rivers, killing millions of marine animals. Wales was the first home nation to introduce a 5p charge four years ago. Since then it is estimated that the number of bags issued at the tills is down by more than 75per cent. The decision represents a victory for Daily Mail readers and the ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign, which launched in February 2008 ith the backing of groups from the National Trust to the Campaign to Protect Rural England . There, families have found no significant problems in switching to re-usable bags and baskets for their shopping. Some other EU nations already have controls in place. Italy has a ban and Spain will introduce one in 2018, while there are levies in the Czech Republic and Malta. A number of countries have taxes on shops which give out free bags, including Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Hungary, Latvia, Netherlands, Romania, and Slovenia. The Danish Green MEP Margrete Auken, who pushed the legislation through the European parliament, called the approval ‘a historic breakthrough in tackling the pervasive problem of plastic waste’.","EU decision is a victory for Daily Mail readers and Ban the Bags campaign .

"Christopher Taft, 21, was arrested on charges of aggravated assault . A pair of birthday pranks gone wrong have landed a Florida man in jail and his sister with a BB lodged in her buttocks. Christopher Taft, of Holly Hills, Florida, allegedly shot his sister in the backside with a BB gun after she gave him a phallic-shaped cake for his 21st birthday. Taft later told police that he thought it would be funny, according to WKMG-TV. His sister didn't think so. She called the cops. Officers arrived to the home on Sunday and arrested Taft on aggravated battery and battery. His sister told officers she didn't want to press charges, but Taft was hauled away to the Volusia County Jail anyway. According to WKMG, Taft's sister had the BB lodged under the skin in her backside. She refused medical attention and said she would go to the hospital herself to have the pellet removed. Even low-power airguns - like the famous Daisy Red Ryder - have muzzle velocity of 350 feet per second, which is enough to break the skin. Others, which can be used to kill small game, can shoot projectiles at velocities of more than 2,000 feet per second. It is not known what kind of BB gun was used.

"Scrawled images of Mr Spock have started appearing on Canadian $5 bills, with Star Trek fans defacing the former prime minster in honor of actor Leonard Nimoy. The act of giving Sir Wilfrid Laurier - who was head of government from 1896 to 1911 - Spock's pointy Vulcan ears, sharp eyebrows and signature bowl haircut is apparently nothing new. But following the death of 83-year-old Nimoy last week from lung cancer, amateur artists have been out in force, even triggering a reaction from the national bank. Tribute: Scrawled images of Mr Spock have started appearing on Canadian $5 bills, with Star Trek fans defacing the former prime minster in honor of actor Leonard Nimoy. Long-running tradition: The act of giving Sir Wilfrid Laurier - who was head of government from 1896 to 1911 - Spock's pointy Vulcan ears, sharp eyebrows and signature bowl haircut is apparently nothing new . A spokeswoman from the central reserve, Josianne Menard, said Tuesday that scribbling on the blue bills is inappropriate because it defaces a symbol and source of national pride. Menard warned defaced bills may not circulate for as long and risk being rejected by retailers. 'There are important reasons why it should not be done,' she noted. However, Canada's central bank confirmed this week that it is not illegal to deface or even mutilate banknotes. Following Nimoy's death Friday, social media users posted their own versions of Sir Laurier's Vulcan makeover to honor the actor. But following the death of 83-year-old Nimoy (seen here in a 1982 episode of Star Trek) last week from lung cancer, amateur artists have been out in force, even triggering a reaction from the national bank . 'Spock your $5 bills for Leonard Nimoy,' a group called the Canadian Design Resource tweeted alongside its depiction. Images of the altered bills circulated widely online and attracted international media attention to something many Canadians had never seen before - although for others, it was hardly a new frontier. Calgary artist Tom Bagley, who posted his own Spock-Laurier hybrid on Facebook and Flickr after Nimoy's death, described it as a traditional bar trick to impress the waitress. 'I always thought it was OK as long as the numbers were intact - it still counted as money,' he said. 'That's what I heard. Because stuff happens, like say you spill spaghetti sauce all over it or something like that.' 'Spocking Fives' even has its own identity on Facebook,  where Canadians are encouraged to post their revision of Sir Laurier’s face. A description accompanying the page - founded in 2008 - states:  'The origins of this mysterious tradition are shrouded in secrecy, although it is widely believed to be totally awesome.'","The act of giving Sir Wilfrid Laurier - who was head of government from 1896 to 1911 - Spock's pointy Vulcan ears, sharp eyebrows and signature bowl haircut is apparently nothing new .

"The number of drivers hauled before the courts for using their mobiles at the wheel has plummeted by nearly half. Despite alarming evidence that growing numbers of motorists are committing the offence, the number of prosecutions has fallen by some 16,000 over three years. In one area, Greater Manchester, the fall has been even more sharp, and is down by 80 per cent. Official figures also showed worrying falls in the number of court cases brought against other driving offences, including those for drink drive offences, and dangerous driving. That is despite evidence deaths occuring as a result are on the rise. The number of drivers hauled before the courts for using mobile phone at the wheel has plummeted by nearly half. Stock photo . The figures were compiled by Labour, which warned that reckless drivers were ‘getting away with it’ and blamed cuts to the police front line. Shadow roads minister Richard Burden said: ‘Road users have had enough of reckless drivers getting away with it. ‘Under the Conservative-led Government progress on road safety is slowing while more and more drivers go unpunished for dangerous and drink driving. ‘The hands-off approach to enforcement is not working. Crashes from mobile phone use are on the rise but thousands fewer drivers are being punished for this deadly offence.’ The research follows calls from Britain’s top traffic officer for drivers caught using their mobiles at the wheel to be banned. Gloucester chief constable Suzette Davenport said the rise in offending meant tougher punishments were needed, and accused ministers of failing to act for fear of offending voters. An estimated 500,000 motorists break the law every day but ordinarily using a hand-held mobile at the wheel usually attracts only a £100 fine with three penalty points. Figures also showed worrying falls in the number of court cases brought against other driving offences, including those for drink drive offences. Stock photo . The new data shows police are using formal powers to prosecute much less often. Across England and Wales, the number of prosecutions for using a mobile at the wheel fell from 35,255 to 19,650 between 2013 and 2011. That is a fall of 15,605, or 44 per cent. In Greater Manchester, the number of prosecutions fell from nearly 2,000 in 2010 to just 329 in 2013. Falls of more than 60 per cent were seen in the Cumbria, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Midlands, Warwickshire and Kent police areas. Research has suggested using a mobile slows reactions more than cannabis or alcohol use. Drivers’ reactions fell by half while holding their phone and on a call, more than a third when texting and by a quarter during a hands-free call. The number of crashes attributed to mobile phone use has grown by 12 per cent, from 378 in 2012 to 422 last year. The alternative to a formal prosecution is a fixed penalty notice, but the number of these handed out is also down by 26 per cent. Drink drive deaths rose by one fifth from 2011-12 and while the numbers prosecuted for drink driving offences is down nine per cent. Miss Davenport, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on road issues, told the BBC on Sunday: ‘If someone is caught twice using a mobile phone within a period of time we should be considering things like disqualifications. ‘If we don’t do something fundamentally different we are going to have lost this. I have had those conversations with ministers. I would take a much harder line in terms of outcomes from enforcement. The minister doesn’t like my proposal.’ Ministers rejected the claim they were blocking road safety reform for electoral reasons and accused chief constables of taking the easy option of using speed cameras instead of deploying more traffic officers.","The number of prosecutions has fallen by some 16,000 over three years .

"The volunteer wildlife rescue clinic which won the nation's heart after saving dozens of animals from January's Adelaide bushfires, is in danger of being forced to shut down after incurring $200,000 worth of legal fees. The Australian Marine Wildlife Research and Rescue Organisation (AMWRRO) is the only group in South Australia that is licensed to rescue, rehabilitate and release marine wildlife and the only organisation in the country with a purpose-built facility to hold them long term. President and founder Aaron Machado said AMWRRO rescues dozens of animals each day, from turtles to seals and sea birds, and that the organisation's closure would be 'a blow to not only South Australia, but to all of Australia'. Australian Marine, Wildlife Research and Rescue Organisation (AMWRRO) could face closure after incurring $200,000 worth of legal fees . James the seal is pictured being released after several weeks of care . The nonprofit group is the only organisation in South Australia that is licensed to rescue, rehabilitate and release marine wildlife. A net killed a juvenile fur seal which washed ashore  in October . They also regularly help  native wildlife and continue to treat koalas and kangaroos who were injured in the Adelaide brushfires earlier this year . 'There would be nothing left in South Australia to help these sea creatures. We are the only ones,' Mr Machado told Daily Mail Australia. 'Every day we see seals who have been entangled in fishing tackle, turtles who come up after eating plastic, animals who have been attacked by dogs. Sea birds are our biggest clientèle though.' The nonprofit organisation, which has almost 500 registered volunteers, was sued for defamation by an employee at the Department of Environment Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR) three years ago and lost the court battle on January 22 of this year. 'I sent an email to minister a few years ago about an animal welfare case outlining my concerns and the individual mentioned in the email believed he was defamed and launched defamation proceedings against me and the organisation,' Mr Machado explained. 'Every day we see seals who have been entangled in fishing tackle, turtles who come up after eating plastic, animals who have been attacked by dogs. Sea birds are our biggest clientele though,' President and founder Aaron Machado said . Jeffery the sea bird was caked in fatty grease when he was helped by the organisation, which is facing closure after incurring $200,000 in legal fees. The pelican had found his way into an uncovered 'grease trap' at a waste management depot and underwent a two hour scrub to remove 95 per cent of the fat . A young Wood Duck was treated after being shot with two home-made arrows that narrowly missed her internal organs . The group was sued for defaming a state government worker in an email and now could be forced to shut down due to being unable to afford the $200,000 fee . The loss means that AMWRRO has to pay damages of $59,000 as well as both their opposition's and their own legal costs on top of the court fees: a total estimated value of $200,000. 'We are a non-profit organisation that I have funded by mortgaging my house four times in the last 17 years every time we need medical equipment or a boat,' Mr Machado said. 'We run off membership costs, donations and corporate sponsorship. We are a state wide organisation which works all over Australia without government funding. 'It costs $50,000 a year to run the organisation and we'll be lucky to have that in our account let alone the $200,000. The money we do get coming in on an annual basis it difficult enough to maintain without having something like this come up.' In January, AMWRRO rescued Jeremy, who suffered second-degree partial thickness burns on all his four paws from the raging bushfires in South Australia . Before and after: Jeremy's paws have recovered greatly since the koala recieved intensive care treatment . The organisation is still in the process of assisting dozens of native animals, including koalas and kangaroos, after the state's bushfires destroyed their homes . Although Mr Machado plans to appeal the judge's decision, asked what would happen if his appeal fails, he said: 'We'll have to shut down, sell the assets and pay the lawyers.

National Security Agency, but Russia has repeatedly refused to . extradite him. He has been charged with theft of government property and two counts of violating the 1917 Espionage Act.

"Most little girls will exchange bracelets and gifts with their closest friends, but one eight-year-old has been receiving trinkets from a more unusual source - the birds in her garden. Gabi Mann, from Seattle, Washington, feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange. The youngster has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads, buttons, pieces of metal, brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions. Scroll down for video and listen to an interview with Gabi . Gabi Mann (above) leaves peanuts out for the crows in her neighbourhood and in return they leave her gifts . Perhaps the most touching is a metal fragment with the word 'best' written on it - one half of a pendant that would be completed by the word 'friend' if reunited with the other part. Among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl-coloured heart. 'It's showing me how much they love me,' Gabi told the podcast The BitterSweet Life and the BBC. 'They give me all the special stuff you could ever find. 'We know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty and nothing like what a person would carry around. Sometimes we find them on the bird feeder.' The image above shows just some of Gabi's favourite items left for her by birds in exchange for peanuts . Gabi and her mother leave nuts for the crows on a bird feeder (above) along with fresh water in a water bath . Listen to the full podcast by The BitterSweet Life when they visited Gabi and her mother Lisa in Seattle . Her strange relationship with the birds began in 2011 when as a four-year-old she would accidentally drop food. Groups of crows began loitering around the family house hoping to pick up the scraps Gabi left behind. When she started going to school, Gabi began feeding them her lunch. The birds then started lining up to wait for the youngster to get off her bus at the end of the school day. Two years later Gabi and her mother Lisa began leaving food outside in their garden on a daily basis - filling the bird bath with water and leaving peanuts on feeders. Members of the crow family are known to be among the cleverest of birds, but scientists are finding that they may have intelligence that rivals most mammals and even young children. An experiment by the University of Cambridge showed that crows can perform task that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The problem-solving creature performed the series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult set up of the course beforehand. The wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat. The animal was later released. In another astonishing test set up by BBC Two, a crow called 007 completed an eight stage puzzle in two and a half minutes. It is one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever devised. The programme shows 007 the crow completing the eight stage puzzle in approximately two-and-a-half minutes. The individual processes are detailed in this diagram . As Gabi throws the food for the birds, crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence. In return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb, earrings, pieces of Lego, rusted screws, polished rocks and glass beads. Gabi keeps all of the bits in carefully labelled pots and ranks them according to her favourite. She said: 'I think they know my favourite colour - blue. They know that I like Lego and shiny things. They are my type.' Crows are known to be highly intelligent creatures - capable of solving complex puzzles and problems to obtain food. Experts say they can often form strong bonds with people that feed them, but equally can mark out those that they consider a threat. People who have thrown stones at crows or tried to help an injured chick can find themselves mobbed by the creatures for weeks or even years afterwards. In perhaps the most astonishing story, however, Gabi's mother Lisa describes how the crows in their neighbourhood appear to keep watch over the family. Lisa Mann and her daughter Gabi (above) have formed a unique bond with the crows in their neighbourhood . She said that on one occassion she had been out taking photographs of an eagle when she dropped her lens cap on the floor and forgot to pick it up before walking home. She said: 'About an hour later I went back outside to see if I could find it and a crow had put it on the side of one of the bird baths. 'I looked at the surveillence video to find out if it was a crow and you can see it bring it into the yard, walk it to the bird bath and spends time rinsing the lens cap and puts it on the side of the bird bath. It was pretty impressive. 'I'm sure it was intentional. They watch us all the time.' Gabi Mann keeps her collection of gifts from the birds carefully arranged in bags and pots shown above . Gabi herself believes her relationship with the crows has given her a special bond with the natural world and calls herself Nature Girl. She is highly protective of the gifts she has received from the birds, not allowing anyone to touch the trinkets. Her mother said: 'For the most part the common denominator is that they are shiney and small enough to fit in their mouth.' Professor John Marzluff, an expert on avian social ecology at the University of Washington, said he believes the crows may be offering up the gifts as they would to a potential mate. Speaking to The BitterSweet Life podcast, he said: 'I have seen an awful lot of things crows bring people. They do bring gifts whether it is always going to happen, I don't think so. The crows regularly carry gifts, like above, to the water bath and bird feeder in the family's garden after eating . 'Certain individual crows the bond they form with that person might be more of a courtship bond where they are bringing presents like they would for their mates. 'For some people they are dead baby birds and other people they get shiny pendants or beautiful glass.' For anyone hoping to form a bond with some corvids, he has some advice. 'The best thing you can do if you want to form a bond with a crow is to be consistent in rewarding them for whatever the action is with a few peanuts in the shell,' he said. 'They like that food as it is a high fat high energy food and it makes noise when you throw it on the ground.They quickly habituate to your routine. They will follow you.'","Gabi Mann lives in Seattle, Washington, where local crows bring her gifts .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have issued a new set of rules jihadis must live by - including restrictions on when to utter curses and a ban on women slapping their thighs. A fighter calling himself Abu 'Umar al-Masri, who claims to be based in the terrorists' capital Raqqa, tweeted photographs of flyers containing fatwas imposed on local residents in recent weeks. Providing a unique glimpse in to life under ISIS' brutal and oppressive control, each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Among the more unusual commands are orders that men must refrain from swearing while playing billiards or table football, and information on exactly when it is permitted for women dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs. Militants: A fighter calling himself Abu 'Umar al-Masri, who claims to be based in the terrorists' capital Raqqa (pictured), tweeted photographs of flyers containing fatwas imposed on local residents in recent weeks . Dictats: Each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by ISIS . Each of the 32 paper fatwas seen in Abu 'Umar al-Masri's tweets last month are numbered and dated, and are written in Arabic. It is understood the 32 fatwas are taken from approximately 70 new rules and regulations issued by the Islamic State in 2015. The letters are written in Arabic and address the city's population, which terror analysis website Jihadica claims proves they are meant for local use, not wider propaganda purposes. The fatwas are unlikely to have been issued by any body other than ISIS' official Sharia Council, to whom even leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi reports. Jihadica claims that this means 30-year-old Bahraini scholar and council leader Turki al-Bin'ali is the likely author. Abu 'Umar al-Masri's tweets show that the list of new rules have been issued in a kind of stapled book and are structured in a question and answer format. Although they pieces of paper are dated using an official Islamic State calender, Jihadica converted the dates to show that they were issued to citizens between December and February this year. Oppressed: Among the more unusual legal explantions is information on exactly when it is permitted for women living under ISIS to dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs . Horror: At times the fatwas make harrowing reading, such as the rule justifying jihadis burning 'unbelievers' to death because the Prophet Mohammed ordered his enemies' eyes to be gouged out with hot iron . The fatwas issued by the Islamic State are highly bureaucratic, demanding fighters hand over one fifth of all money and items looted to the terror group's officials, insisting fighters cannot leave territory under ISIS control under any circumstances, and banning women from showing their eyes. At times they make for harrowing reading, such as the rule justifying jihadis burning 'unbelievers' to death because the Prophet Mohammed ordered his enemies' eyes to be gouged out with hot irons. The bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters, such as when citizens are due compensation,  how women should ensure they are dressed, and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor. Despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months, they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of Islamic State passports is  banned as they enable citizens to 'travel to the lands of disbelief' - something expressly forbidden in an earlier dictat. On a lighter note, both billiards and table football are allowed  - albeit under strict conditions and with a warning that God does not look particularity favourably on such trivial pursuits. Gambling on matches is, predictably, banned, but so is using table football characters shaped like humans, as the creation of anything imitating humans or animals is banned under ISIS' exceptionally strict interpretation of Islamic law. Fatwa 35: December 11, 2014 . One fifth of all war booty it is to be given to the office of war booty. Fatwa 36: December 11, 2014 . Tax should be levied on agricultural holdings that once belonged to apostates. Fatwa 37: December 16, 2014 . It is not permissible to travel to the lands of the unbelievers - including areas controlled by the Assad regime. Fatwa 38: December 2, 2014 . It permissible to curse  by accusing someone of being a disbeliever, but you must never say they are destined for hellfire. Fatwa 40: December 17, 2014 . Women should not wear make-up or show any part of their face, including their eyes, in case lures men into temptation. Fatwa 41: December 17, 2014 . Women can carry weapons such as Kalashnikov rifles under their robes providing they do not add definition to her body, luring men into temptation. Fatwa 42: December 17, 2014 . Female nurses must not work in an office with a male doctor unless they have a male guardian. Fatwa 43: December 17, 2014 . Women must see only female doctors for treatment. If a female doctor cannot be found, then it is permissible to see a male doctor, but on the condition that he not be alone with her. Fatwa 44: December 17, 2014 . Women must cover their entire body in thick, loose fitting material that does not resemble the clothing of men or that of women in the West. They must not slap their thighs or act flirtatiously as it is highly arousing, nor can they wear perfume. Fatwa 45: December 17, 2014 . A woman must travel with a male guardian at all times . Fatwa 46: December 17, 2014 . Women whose husbands have been killed must be punished if they try to leave ISIS-held territory for the lands of the unbelievers. Fatwa 47: December 18, 2014 . The length of time between the call to prayer and the call just before prayer must vary from prayer to prayer, according to the sunnah. Fatwa 48:  December 20, 2014 . You must not sell Islamic State passports to allow citizens to travel to the land of unbelievers. Fatwa 49:  December 28, 2014 . It is permissible to play billiards providing the game does not allow gambling, encourage cursing, or inhibit the worshiping or God . Fatwah 50: December 28, 2014 . It is permissible to play foosball [table football] providing the game does not allow gambling, encourage cursing, feature characters in human or animal form, or inhibit the worshiping or God. Brutal: The bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters, such as how women should dress and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor . Fatwa: Despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months, they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of Islamic State passports is banned as they enable citizens to 'travel to the lands of disbelief' One chilling fatwa appears to confirm reports that ISIS operates an organ harvesting scheme. 'It is permissible to transplant the healthy organs of the body of an apostate to the body of a Muslim, in order to save the latter's life or improve his condition if he has lost organs,' the letter states . 'The jurists of the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of Islamic law, among others, permitted killing belligerent unbelievers or apostates and eating their flesh as a life-saving measure. The case of organ transplantation as a life-saving measure is similar,' it adds. 'Moreover, it is established that the lives and organs of apostates are fundamentally licit. Their organs may thus be taken, whether or not the apostates are alive or already dead, and whether or not doing so results in their death,' it goes on to claim. AK-47 assault rifles, one fatwa insists, are perfectly acceptable to be carried beneath a women's clothes, providing it doesn't add definition to her body that could be deemed tempting to men. Likewise all forms of Western clothing are banned in order not to 'imitate the unbeliever', although the fatwas still feel the need to say it is illegal to sell counterfeit brand-name clothing and household products, as selling fake produce is a form of deceit. One surprising law bans the practice of men swapping sisters or daughters for brides of their own, apparently because it 'does an injustice to the bride'. Instead, ISIS demand, the bride must grant permission for any marriage to take place. The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say. It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law. The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example. But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith. An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad . It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections. Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners. But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS. He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme. He added: 'It would be a mistake to conclude the Islamic State group's extremism is the true Islam that emerges from the Koran and Hadith.","Militants issue new set of rules for citizens of the Islamic State to live by .

"Ian Paterson was suspended after he performed hundreds of unnecessary partial mastectomies . Hundreds of victims of a breast surgeon who carried out botched operations may never receive compensation because of a loophole in his insurance policy. Ian Paterson was suspended after he performed hundreds of unnecessary partial mastectomies on at least 250 healthy women over a 15-year period. An independent review revealed the 57-year-old also carried out 'cleavage sparing' mastectomies on at least 450 other women, in which breast tissue was left. Paterson pioneered the operations on women, leaving part of their breast behind solely for cosmetic reasons - dramatically increasing the risk of their cancer returning. More than 700 patients were recalled by the hospitals where Paterson worked, as part of the review overseen by Sir Ian Kennedy. The surgeon worked at both NHS and private hospitals across the Midlands from 1994, until he was suspended in 2012. While Paterson's NHS patients are able to pursue compensation claims through the health service's channels, it is the surgeon's private patients that are facing being left with nowhere to turn. Those who went under the knife at Spire Hospitals in Little Aston and Solihull may miss out on the compensation their lawyers say they are entitled to. Surgeons who work in private hospitals have to take out their own insurance to cover themselves against medical negligence claims. However Paterson's insurance company, the Medical Defence Union (MDU), is disputing the compensation claims. It is doing so on the basis that some of the operations carried out may have been illegal and  are not included in Paterson's cover. Louise Hawkley, a medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, is representing patients treated by Paterson at the Spire Hospitals. She said: 'The insurance company will usually be liable for any claims made for clinical negligence and, if compensation is awarded, this will be due from the insurer under the terms of the policy. 'Mr Paterson took out insurance with the Medical Defence Union (MDU). 'However, the MDU has confirmed it is not instructed by Mr Paterson, not authorised to accept service of any proceedings and that Irwin Mitchell's clients ""should have no expectation of any continuing MDU involvement in this matter"". 'MDU cover is discretionary and may legitimately be withdrawn if a surgeon's practice falls outside of the insurance terms. One of the victims who is facing losing out on compensation is Jade Edgington, 24, who underwent unnecessary surgery to remove non-cancerous lumps from her breasts. Miss Edgington, from Shirley, in the West Midlands, was 16 when she discovered a large lump in her left breast. Thanks to her father's Bupa medical insurance, was seen almost immediately by Paterson in October 2005. After an ultrasound, Paterson told the then teenager she had a lump 'the size of a golf ball' in her breast and it needed to be removed. Just over a year later, in December 2006, Jade discovered another smaller lump in her right breast. Paterson removed it a month later, reassuring her that the lumps were nothing to worry about. She went back to him again in April 2007 after discovering another small lump, this time in her left breast, and again Paterson cut it out. Finally, in April 2009, she discovered a small lump in the scar left behind from the first operation in her left breast. Former patients of Ian Paterson's, Jade Edgington, 24, left, and Julie Robinson, right, face missing out on compensation despite having had unnecessary operations at the hands of the breast surgeon . Paterson told her it was a 'stitch granuloma' - harmless cells around the wound site - but he removed it anyway. Finally in November 2011, Miss Edgington was told the operations had been unnecessary. Shockingly, because the operations were carried out a private hospital, Miss Edgington is unlikely to receive any compensation, despite lawyers advising she could expect up to £50,000. She said: 'I thought he was lovely. He was charismatic and confident. He put me and my parents at ease. 'Apparently, he should have performed a fine needle laparoscopy on the lump to see if it was cancerous before deciding whether to remove it, but when a surgeon says you need an operation, you don't question it. 'Dad said: ""Jade, if the surgeon says you've got to have it out, you've got to have it out"". He feels terribly guilty now, but every parent would say the same. 'I feel furious that because of a loophole, hundreds of potential victims might not get any compensation. 'It adds insult to injury and he's basically been allowed to get away with ruining people's lives.' She added: 'No amount of money will make up for what I went through but it would help me rebuild my life and is recognition of what this man (Paterson) did to me and hundreds of others.' Victim Julie Robinson, 54, had an unnecessary lumpectomy at Little Aston Hospital in June 2005 and also faces missing out on compensation. The mother-of-two, from Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands, said: 'I feel betrayed. It was so shocking, that someone could do something to violate you when you are at your most vulnerable. 'It feels very unjust that we are not able to take things forward and he's getting away with it. He should be made to pay. 'It seems shocking that there isn't the same rules of cover for private patients as NHS patients. 'It shouldn't matter - if a doctor is negligent he should be held accountable.' 'This is a unique situation, where a private surgeon's practices fall outside of their insurance cover, and there is no safety net for patients.' Ms Hawkley said her clients believed they would receive 'greater care and treatment' by choosing to have their operations at a private hospital. 'Many clients started out in the NHS and paid privately to see Mr Paterson to expedite their treatment,' she said. 'Our clients are aggrieved that they actually paid to undergo negligent treatment and, now that the negligence is known, they may have no recourse against Mr Paterson, his insurer, or the hospital where they received that treatment.' A cleavage sparing mastectomy involved leaving behind some breast tissue to provide an improved cleavage for the patient. But it breached national guidelines, which state that leaving tissue after a mastectomy increases the chances of cancer recurring - especially if the remaining breast tissue does not receive radiotherapy. This is because a significant proportion of breast tissue is deliberately left by the surgeon in the inner aspect of the breast in order to give the patient breast cleavage - even in women not undergoing immediate reconstruction. The technique is different to the widely-used skin sparing mastectomy, where the surgeon leaves behind an envelope of skin to improve the appearance of breast reconstruction. She added: 'This is a deeply unfair set of circumstances whereby Mr Paterson's patients who received treatment in the NHS are rightly receiving the compensation which they are due, but the patients who opted to pay privately may be left out of pocket for the treatment itself and without any compensation for negligent injuries identical to those suffered by Mr Paterson's patients in the NHS. 'It is distressing both to Mr Paterson's private patients, and professionally as a medical negligence lawyer, that it is legitimate and accepted for insurance cover to be suspended and/or withdrawn on a discretionary basis, affording no obvious recourse to private patients.' Paterson worked at NHS and private hospitals across the Midlands from 1994 until he was suspended last year. He was employed by Heart of England in March 1998, having been suspended by another trust. Colleagues became concerned that he was not removing enough tissue during mastectomies and two investigations were carried out, in 2003 and 2004. Although a number of recommendations were made about his surgery, nothing was done to stop him. Fears raised by a surgeon in 2007 were not properly acted upon. Paterson was told to stop cleavage-sparing operations but continued until as late as 2011. Paterson was suspended by the trust in May 2011 but his pay was not stopped for 18 months. In July 2013, Paterson and his physiotherapist wife Louise, 53, sold their £1.25 million Grade II listed, eight-bedroom, four reception Georgian home in Edgbaston, Birmingham. West Midlands Police confirmed the 'long and complex' investigation into Mr Paterson was still ongoing, but that they had no current updates on the case. Spire, which runs private hospitals at Little Aston and Solihull, has already issued 'an unreserved apology' to Paterson's patients. The Medical Defence Union told MailOnline it cannot comment on the case.","Breast surgeon Ian Paterson was suspended after performing unnecessary partial mastectomies on at least 250 healthy women over 15-year period .

"A striking set of twins, who were born with radically different colouring thanks to mixed-race parentage, have revealed how they constantly have to explain their looks to curious strangers. Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Lucy and Maria Aylmer, both 18, said classmates at school thought they were telling fibs when they revealed they were twins. Lucy and Maria's mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and in a genetic quirk, together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin. Lucy (left) and Maria (right) Aylmer, both 18, have faced questions from curious strangers throughout their lives over their radically different looks. Lucy even uploaded a photo of her birth certificate to Facebook . The twins say it isn't just their looks that are different, they have individual personalities too. Lucy (far left) says she's much more shy than her sister Maria (second left), despite being born 23 seconds before her . Speaking to Ben Shepherd and Susanna Reid, the twins, from Gloucester, opened up about how their distinctively different looks had often made life difficult at school. Red-haired Lucy said her pale complexion had prompted speculation that she'd been adopted: 'My classmates used to ask if I was adopted because my siblings are all quite dark. 'It was pretty hard, it went on in secondary school and it wasn't very nice.' When the girls were first born in 1997, their mother Donna had no idea that she could give birth to such different looking twins, described by experts as a one-in-a-million chance. Growing up, the girls said they regularly overheard people asking their mum 'Which one is yours?' or 'Are you the childminder?'. Although most of their friends now know their unique story, they still have to present new acquaintances with photos of their birth certificates to prove they really are twin sisters. 'Our friends do believe us now because we make a big fuss,' says Maria. 'We've got birth certificates. Lucy even had a picture of hers on her Facebook [profile].' As the girls have turned into grown-ups they've tried to find their own style. Lucy, who has naturally curly hair, straightens it to ensure a sleek look. And the twins stopped wearing the same outfits when they were seven. Lucy says: 'I think I said to my mum: ""I don't want to wear the same clothes as Maria any more"".' Same same, but different:  Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins . When asked at what age the girls knew their situation might raise questions from others, they say it took them a long time to know that their family was anything but ordinary. 'It is what it is,' says Maria. 'We never even picked up on it until friends started talking about it at school.' Their mother, who is 47 and a warehouse worker, and their 53-year-old father, who works as a scaffolder, split up after the twins were born. The 18-year-olds have three older siblings, George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21. Lucy told the Daily Mail: ‘Our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween Maria and I. We are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween. ‘But my grandmother has a very fair English rose complexion, just like mine.’ She added: ‘No one ever believes we are twins. Even when we dress alike, we still don’t look like sisters, let alone twins.’ Family line: The twins' mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and their siblings George, Chynna and Jordan all have darker skin than Lucy and lighter than Maria . Two of a kind: The twins, who live in Gloucester, were born in January 1997 . Different strokes:  'Outgoing' Maria studies law at Cheltenham College, while 'shy' Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College . All together: Maria and Lucy with their mother Donna and siblings George, 23, Chynna, 22, and Jordan, 21 . Non-identical twins come from separate eggs, so inherit different genes. The girls’ half-Jamaican mother carries genes for both white and black skin. By chance, Lucy will have inherited genes for white skin and Maria will have genes that code for black skin. People with Afro-Caribbean heritage often have some European DNA, dating back in many cases to the slave trade. This increases the chance of them passing on a gene for white skin to at least one twin. Lucy said of her time at school: ‘We were in the same class, but no one had a problem telling us apart. Twins are known for swapping identities. But there was no way Maria and I could ever do anything like that. ‘Most twins look like two peas in a pod – but we couldn’t look more different if we tried. We don’t look like we have the same parents, let alone having been born at the same time.’ The twins’ interests are as different as their looks. Lucy studies art and design at Gloucester College whilst Maria studies law at Cheltenham College. Lucy explained: ‘Maria was outgoing whilst I was the shy one. But Maria loves telling people at college that she has a white twin – and I’m very proud of having a black twin.’","Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins .

"They are not the first places which come to mind when making a  booking, but as these pictures show, there are some rather interesting restaurant loos in the UK. There has been an increase in restaurants providing much more than just a meal, and as these designer toilets show, restaurants are now fighting to make themselves more memorable. Whether it's the incredible views at Aqua Shard, Sketch's futuristic pods or Abracadabra's X-rated sink ornaments, the loo is another chance for a venue to impress, and restaurants are grasping this opportunity with both hands. Weird cocooned pods comprise the intergalactic space-age landscape in the Sketch Gallery loo . Nopi's Hall of Mirrors: A work of dazzling art, you may have trouble upon both entry and escape from these labyrinthine lavatories . 'Over the last few years we've seen a marked increase in restaurants that provide much more than just a meal to the customer; these venues use every aspect of their customer experience to pack a real punch and make themselves more memorable,' said Josephine Ellis, European Head of Communications at Bookatable.co.uk. 'A big part of this has been designer toilets which often surprise diners with their fun and quirky designs at a point during a meal when all we really expect to see are cubicles and sinks,' she continued. From loos running retro nature documentaries and pre-warmed toilet seats which powder your bum once you've finished to phallic tap fittings and rusty cans serving as urinals, here at 14 of the UK's strangest loos. 1. Sketch Gallery, Mayfair . Some wonderfully weird cocooned pods comprise the intergalactic space-age landscape in the Sketch Gallery lavatories. Whilst you are in the dinosaur-egg pod, your ears will be treated to the soothing sounds of retro nature documentaries. Oh, and there are Victorian maids, just to further enhance the already esoteric setting. 2. The Bell Inn, East Sussex . Who would have thought that a trumpet could double as a urinal? The Bell Inn prove that you can simultaneously blow your horn and take a leak in their trumpet urinals. Hitting all the right notes with their wonderful quirks and boutique artefacts, The Bell Inn is a hidden restaurant and inn with bold-as-brass swagger in Ticehurst, East Sussex. The Sun Inn in Edinburgh's gloriously rustic bucket urinals where each visit really does end up in the can . Blowing your own trumpet: The men's loos in The Bell Inn, Sussex feature trumpets which double as urinals . 3. Crazy Bear, Fitzrovia . Not that we'd encourage illicit voyeurism but at Crazy Bear it's all too easy to get a glimpse into the dark side via the dazzlingly glam, open communal sinks. You enter via a concealed mirrored door, but be warned: all that glitters is seemingly not gold. With all the mirror action it can be tricky to distinguish male and females loos apart so take care not to accidentally intrude. 4. Ta Bouche Restaurant and Bar, Cambridge . Having made a real splash with their innovative video game toilets, Captive Media are on a mission to revolutionise lavatorial interior design. Even though they were rebuffed on Dragon's Den, they have gone onto furnish numerous restaurant bars with video game urinals, including venues in London and Cambridge. Open into the wee small hours, Ta Bouche Restaurant and Bar is surely the front-runner for toilet gaming technology in Cambridge. Earn your stripes: The Zebra-zapped, glorious toilet heaven of Camden's Shaka Zulu . Toilets within toilets at London's The Attendant, which is a converted 19th-century washroom . The Japanese-inspired toilets in M Restaurants will massage you with rhythmic spurts of water then dry you off with air jets and powder your bottom before you leave . 5. M Restaurants, The City . These Japanese-heated toilets at swanky M Restaurants treat you to a proper pampering session: a nifty little control panel means that you can choose massaging water motions and complete your Tokyo-style toilet experience with drying air jets and a spot of powdering. You'll never think about a 'wash and blow dry' in the same way again. 6. Aqua Shard, London Bridge . Aqua Shard wins the prize in the stakes for adrenaline-fuelled toilet highs. You can take in the spectacular London skyline with these city-slicking powder rooms 31 floors up, surrounded by 180-degree London views. You've definitely made it when you can say you've answered the call of nature from these lofty heights. Men's toilets in Ta Bouche Restaurant and Bar, Cambridge feature video game consoles above the urinals . Spend with a view: Gaze at the bright lights of the big city as you spend a penny in Aqua Shard's loos . 7. The Sun Inn, Edinburgh . Named Scottish Gastropub of The Year in 2011, The Sun Inn near Edinburgh bring their unique brand of boutique style-chic to Lothian Bridge, but it doesn't quite extend as far as the toilets. The gents have some gloriously rustic bucket urinals, meaning each visit really does end up 'in the can.' Simple, yes, but it does the job. 8. Abracadabra, Piccadilly . Talk about shooting from the lip. After less than favourable reviews from restaurant critics , Abracadabra has taken some stick for its lascivious, lipstick-mouthed lavs in the men's. For the ladies there are sophisticated, golden phallic taps. Yes. Gold. Phallic. Taps. 9. The Attendant, Fitzrovia . This is getting a bit meta. Toilets within toilets? The Attendant's key selling point is the humble water closet and it commodes your attention at every turn. After 50 years lying abandoned, these 19th-century washrooms reveal ornate Fitzrovian porcelains converted into a dining table that's so clean you could eat your dinner off it. Don't worry, it's been mega-deep-cleaned to within an inch of its life. And the toilets aren't bad either. Going down the pan? Abracadabra's lascivious, lipstick-mouthed lavs (left) and risque loo fittings (right) 10. Nopi, Soho . The menu at Nopi is rustic and directional, yet simple. The lavatories are not. A work of dazzling art, you may have trouble upon both entry and escape from these labyrinthine mirror lavatories, like a nostalgic Hall of Mirrors. Be sure to tell your guests that if you're not out in ten, send reinforcements to rescue you from the never-ending mind-trickery of the mirror maze. 11. Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town, Spitalfields . It's all rather cloak and dagger here. You need to ask to 'see the mayor' to get entry via a fridge to this secret speakeasy hangout, before taking a twisted trip back to your childhood via the fake exit door of the My Little Pony-clad lavs. If you're not into the Brony (adult fan of My Little Pony) thing, then you could skip by the Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town. Creepy commode: A distorted fairground soundtrack, dark lighting and spider-webbed walls at Sketch Lecture Room, Mayfair . Piccadilly's Abracadabra with its phallic taps in the women's loos (left) and heart covered walls (right) While Thomas Crapper didn't actually invent the humble toilet, he founded a plumbing company which now lends its name to these authentic retro-style thrones, found in Jamie's Italian, Manchester . 12. Sketch Lecture Room, Mayfair . Love checking the lavs when you visit a restaurant? Sketch features washrooms that just keep on giving, with not just one but two sets of crazy khazis. Lacroix-inspired, crystal-decked creations that are truly worthy of the royal throne mantel can be found on the way to sketch Lecture Room. A departure from the dinosaur space eggs but almost equally intriguing with a distorted fairground soundtrack and spider web-spangled walls of mystery. 13. Shaka Zulu, Camden . Shaka Zulu has earned its stripes in the exotic khazi stakes with a Zebra-zapped world of glorious toilet heaven. No, it's not safari road kill: it's art. It takes a lot of dollar to achieve this simple yet ostentatious pony-stripe effect. 14 Jamie's Italian, Manchester . Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Crapper didn't actually invent the humble toilet. However, he founded a plumbing company which now lends its name to these authentic retro-style thrones. Jamie Oliver clearly favours an authentic variety of toilet seat and has installed these loos across his restaurant group, including Jamie's Italian in Manchester which features an original Thomas Crapper toilet.","Rustic cans serve as urinals in the award-winning The Sun Inn, Edinburgh .

"Tucked away in dense woodland, this home may just be the perfect place for some quiet reflection - even if its design does make it tricky to find. The walls around the base of this  property, just outside the Polish capital of Warsaw, are clad with mirrors - giving the impression that the top floor of the building is floating.

Marcin Tomaszewski, of Polish architects Reform, said: 'It is a two-storey mirror house concept that is formed of two horizontally configured blocks. The house's lower storey is clad with reflective paneling. These mirrored surfaces appear as an extension of the forest floor, with opaque areas stacked above. 'The bottom level includes also a sheltered terrace in a shade of dark brown wood that matches the surrounding earth.

"Shocked students have described the moment their teacher was found hanged in a locked classroom as they arrived for school on Monday morning. Photography teacher Jillian Jacobson, 31, was discovered at El Dorado High School in Placentia, California, by her own students, who held a candlelit vigil last night for her 'beautiful soul'. Many had just arrived for school and were caught off-guard when the students who discovered popular, well-liked Mrs Jacobson burst into their classroom, clearly distressed. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Photography teacher Jillian Jacobson, 31 (left with a student) was discovered at El Dorado High School in Placentia, California, by her own students, who held a candlelit vigil for her 'beautiful soul' Authorities: Lt Eric Point of Placentia police (left) said preliminary investigations indicated a suicide. Right, an Orange County Fire Authority Chaplain pauses to speak to a student waiting for a ride after the school shut . One sophomore, named only as Holly, told the Orange County Register: 'I was in the class next door when I saw her students run out of the room with pale faces. 'Then teachers were running, then firefighters.' Freshman Tessa Hoover, who was in the classroom next door, added: 'We didn't know what was happening. 'Our teacher ran out of our class, then into the room next door. Then she started screaming. 'Right away we knew something really horrible had happened.' She told the Register her digital media arts teacher returned and locked the door before they were ushered into the gym a few minutes later. Devastating: A 31-year-old California teacher identified by her students as Jillian Jacobson (left and right) was discovered on Monday morning hanging in a classroom. It was distressed students who raised the alarm . Reaction: Lr Eric Point speaks to members of the media outside the school where the teacher was found . Fortitude: Assistant Superintendent Candi Plahy said school was due to resume today to help students cope . Frank Leon, 16, said his teacher left to unlock Jacobson's classroom and he heard 'screaming, crying,' he told the LA Times. 'It freaked the hell out of me.' He added that his teacher was screaming 'Oh my God, oh my God!' Last night more than 100 candles, flowers, cards and trinkets had been placed outside the school gates as students paid tribute to Mrs Jacobson on Twitter. 'We love you Mrs Jacobson,' wrote one. 'You'll never be forgotten.' Another, Mitch Brick, posted a photo of a sunset as he wrote: 'Mrs Jacobson has taught me so much about photography, much love sent out to her, rest in peace. 'Mrs. Jacobson told me that to be a good photographer, you need to get creative and think outside the box.' Kiley Sullivan wrote: 'My heart goes out to El Dorado High School Such a horrible thing to hear. Photo was my favorite class because of her. RIP Mrs Jacobson.' And Amber Guttilla said: 'For those who did not know Mrs Jacobson, there was not a teacher on this planet who cared more for her students. 'Her compassion knew no bounds and she always put us first. Please don't get caught up in the news stories that will only remember her for her final decision. You are so loved Mrs J.' Another user, Chelsey, tweeted: 'By far the most amazing teacher I've ever had. You will be greatly missed and forever in our hearts. RIP Jillian.' Assistant Superintendent Candi Plahy said school was due to resume today to help students cope. Shocking find: Jacobson was found inside a classroom at El Dorado High School in Placentia, California . Students and co-workers remembered the teacher's upbeat smile and thanked her for inspiring them . Crisis counselors have been made available on campus for the most traumatised students. Captain Steve Concialdi, of the Orange County Fire Authority, says the teacher took her life sometime before 8.40am yesterday. According to the police official, students who found the victim initially arrived to a locked classroom. After the two students were let inside by another teacher, the three found the teacher and helped cut her down from the ceiling. Responding paramedics found her lying on the classroom floor suffering from cardiac arrest, and performed CPR but were unable to revive the teacher. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Assistant Superintendent Kevin Lee with Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District said classes were dismissed for the day at 11am. A force for good: Jacobson's (left) father reportedly had killed himself, and she always urged teens not to resort to suicide . He also confirmed there there was an 'emergency medical situation' involving a teacher. Online records show that Jacobson was married and lived with her 34-year-old husband in Anaheim. He has been notified. Several students told the OC Register that Jacobson's father killed himself, and she that she always urged teens in distress not to resort to suicide. There is no word at this time on what may have prompted the popular teacher to end her life. Police said no note was found at the scene, but Lt Eric Point said the preliminary investigation indicated suicide.

"A Florida teacher is facing suspension for calling a 14-year-old Muslim student 'rag-head Taliban'. Deyab-Houssein Wardani, from Weston, said Maria Valdes first called him names in his French class at Cypress Bay High School last month when he walked in wearing a hooded sweater. 'And she said, ""Oh, no, the Taliban is here"",' he told WSVN. 'And at first I took it as a joke because I didn't really know what Taliban was. 'I raised my hand, and she said, ""Yes, Taliban"", and everyone just kind of laughed.' Over the next several days, the 64-year-old teacher, who often nicknames her students, continued referring to Deyab-Houssein as 'Taliban' - even calling him 'rag-head Taliban'. Scroll down for video . Hurt: Muslim student Deyab-Houssein Wardani, left, was repeatedly called 'Taliban' by his French teacher, to the anger of his father, Youssef Wardani, right. They have called for the teacher to be fired or suspended . The teenager, who is an honor role student and a Boy Scout, asked his parents what the word meant, and they were shocked when they learned where he had heard it. 'He's a 14-year-old boy,' his father Youssef Wardani, a Lebanese immigrant whose wife is from Morocco, told CBS Miami. 'He should not have to worry about these kind of actions from a teacher in a class in a school and in a state that advertises diversity.' The parents contacted the assistant principal of the school, and when asked about the name-calling, Mrs Valdes admitted that she had called their son 'rag-head Taliban', WSVN reported. The school then told the Wardanis that their son could move into another French class. 'Seriously!!' Mr Wardani wrote on a Facebook page detailing the incident 'She does the crime and he is the one to be punished.' Accomplished: The Wardani family, right, said their 14-year-old son 'DH' is a hard-working Boy Scout and honor roll student who should not have to worry about such name-calling - especially from a teacher . And when Mr Wardani asked the teacher about what she had said, her response was less than reassuring, he wrote on Facebook. 'She responded with huffing and puffing accompanied with rolling eyes and arrogance,' he wrote. 'She showed no remorse whatsoever!' He said that at first he only wanted an apology, but now he is calling for the teacher to be fired or suspended without pay for a year. Broward County Public Schools has launched an investigation into the incident. 'This situation is being taken seriously,' it said in a statement. 'The district launched an immediate investigation into the matter and will be bringing forward to the school board in March a recommendation for disciplinary action regarding this situation.' Taking action: Administrators at Cypress Bay High School said they are investigating. They will reportedly not fire the teacher but could suspend her for five days - but the Wardanis say that is not enough . CBS reported that the teacher, who has worked for the district for 11 years and has no prior disciplinary record, will not be fired but could face a suspension. Mr Wardani said he was told she would be suspended for five days - but he said that is not enough. The school district is expected to take disciplinary action during a meeting on March 17. In the meantime, Deyab-Houssein, who is known to friends and family as 'DH', has been returning to the same French class but admits it's awkward now. 'I am extremely disappointed with her, and I guess you could say it's sad that someone would think like that to this day,' the boy said.","Deyab-Houssein Wardani said his French teacher, Maria Valdes, 64, called him 'Taliban' when he walked into class at Cypress Bay High last month .

"Smartphones really are addictive and the more you use one, the worse it gets, a new study has revealed. Moodiness, loneliness and jealousy are all key indicators of smartphone addiction, along with an obsession with physical appearance, the University of Derby study found. Psychology lecturer, Dr Zaheer Hussain, who co-authored the study, found that the more you use a smartphone, the higher your risk of becoming addicted. A Study by University of Derby says 13 per cent of us are addicted, and the average user spends 3.6 hours a day on their smartphone (stock image shown). Moodiness, loneliness and jealousy are all key indicators of addiction. An obsession with physical appearance is also a telling sign . He explained that higher scores of narcissism - defined as excessive interest or admiration of oneself and one’s physical appearance - is the most common and obvious sign of the addiction. An obsession with taking selfies and posting them on social media is one key indication. ‘A significant positive relationship was found between narcissism and addiction to the phones, suggesting that the more narcissistic a person is, the more likely they are to be addicted to their smartphone,’ he said. In a move that might seem counter-intuitive, a Berlin-based psychologist has developed an app to help wean us off our gadgets. Called Offtime, it limits which apps can be used to avoid distractions, or prevents people from contacting you unless in an emergency. It doesn’t limit connectivity permanently; instead, users can enable Offtime mode for any time when they need to focus, or at set times during the day. And there are various levels of customisation. For example, all calls, texts and notifications can be blocked during Offtime. Alternatively, users can pre-select so-called VIP contacts that are never blocked, and can get hold of the phone owner even when Offtime is enabled. The study found that 13 per cent of 256 participants were addicts. The average age of those who took part in the online survey was 29. As a result, the researchers say they believe it should be made compulsory that anyone selling smartphones should warn customers of their potentially addictive properties. Dr Hussain said: ‘The study informs us about smartphone overuse and the impact on psychological well-being. 'We now use smartphones on a daily basis and for various tasks so being aware of the psychological effects is very important. ‘There are various smartphone apps such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Candy Crush, as well as Skype and email that make smartphone use psychologically more attractive and can lead to addiction.’ The study also revealed the average user spent 3.6 hours per day on the device, and when the participants were asked if they used their phone in banned areas, 35 per cent answered yes. Social networking sites were the most popularly used apps - 87 per cent - followed by instant messaging apps - 52 per cent - and then news apps - 51 per cent. Relationships were also noted in the research as, despite 46.8 per cent of participants speaking positively of improved social relations, nearly a quarter admitted their smartphones create communication issues within ‘real life’. A study in 2011 found more than half of adults and two thirds of teenagers said they have used their smartphone while socialising with others (stock image shown). Nearly a quarter of adults and a third of teenagers have also used them during mealtimes, according to the study . Professor James Elander, Head of the Centre for Psychological Research at the University of Derby, said: ‘This study is a very timely one with much potential impact, and the findings show that users should be more aware of how they are using their smartphones and of the potential risks of excessive use. A study in 2011 found more than half of adults and two thirds of teenagers said they have used their smartphone while socialising with others. Nearly a quarter of adults and a third of teenagers have used them during mealtimes and over a fifth of adults admitted using or answering their handset in the bathroom. The research found that the line between work and social time is also becoming increasingly blurred with 30 per cent of smartphone users saying they regularly take personal calls during working hours and work calls while they are on holiday. In 2013, John Benson from Blackpool said his addiction to his smartphone led to him losing his job and relationship. His therapist, Steve Pope, said for some of his patients smartphones are ‘as addictive as cocaine or any other drug.’ The research paper, titled: ‘Smartphone Use, Addiction, Narcissism, and Personality: A Mixed Methods Investigation’ has recently been published in the International Journal of Cyber Behaviour, Psychology and Learning (IJCBPL).","Study by University of Derby says 13 per cent of us are addicted .

"Rumours about Huawei’s fitness band and headphones leaked before this year’s Mobile World Congress, but one wearable that surprised many was its first smartwatch. The Huawei Watch is powered by Android Wear, has a 1.4-inch touchscreen and comes with a built-in heart rate monitor. The crown, frame and hinge are made of scratch-resistant stainless steel and there will be 40 watch faces to choose from when it launches. Stylish: The Huawei Watch (pictured) is powered by Android Wear, has a 1.4-inch touchscreen and comes with a built-in heart rate monitor. The crown, frame and hinge are made of scratch-resistant stainless steel . The watch will be available later this year across Europe, Asia and the US although the exact date and price information hasn't been announced. Huawei has a range of wearables including the TalkBand B1, the new B2 and the N1 headphones but this is the Chinese firm’s first smart watch. The 1.4-inch display has a resolution of 400 x 400 pixels, giving it a 286 pixel-per-inch density. By comparison, the Moto 360 which also has a circular screen and has a PPI of 205. PPI is an indicator of image sharpness, clarity and colour and the higher the number, the better. Huawei’s watch pairs with any Android phone running 4.3 and above. The watch (pictured) will be available later this year across Europe, Asia and the US although the exact date and price information hasn't been announced. It runs on a Qualcomm 1.2GHz processor, includes 4GB of storage, 512MB of RAM and is Bluetooth enabled . Multi-tasker: And in addition to the heart rate monitor, the watch has six-axis motion sensor and barometer that automatically detects and tracks in real-time if a user is walking, running, biking, hiking or sleeping . Once connected, notifications received on the phone are also shown on the watch including texts, emails, meetings, calls and Facebook posts, and more. It runs on a Qualcomm 1.2GHz processor, includes 4GB of storage, 512MB of RAM and is Bluetooth enabled. And in addition to the heart rate monitor, the watch has six-axis motion sensor and barometer that automatically detects and tracks in real-time if a user is walking, running, biking, hiking or sleeping. Specifically, users can monitor the number of calories burned, heart rate, climbing height, steps taken, and distance travelled. MailOnline’s Victoria Woollaston reveals her first impressions of the Huawei Watch: . ‘There is a plethora of smartwatches at this year’s Mobile World Congress - and with Apple expected to launch its version on Monday, there are likely to be even more released in the coming months. However, many don’t feel as luxurious at Huawei’s model. The entire crown, frame and hinge are made of steel which makes it feel expensive, sturdy and most importantly, makes it look like a watch. The screen is bright and clear, but its size and the fact it is predominantly used to show notifications means there is little added benefit to this. There will be a range of straps available when the watch launches and I can see it being popular with both sexes. Previous watches such as the Moto 360 feel more masculine, for example. Huawei would not be drawn on battery life or pricing and these will be key to its success, but it is certainly the most stylish and luxurious smart watch I’ve seen.' The firm didn’t reveal battery life details but said that the timepiece (pictured) would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with device. Exact availability and pricing is yet to be announced . ‘We have responded to consumers’ requests from around the world asking for a smartwatch featuring a timeless design that is truly smart from within,’ said Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei Consumer Business Group. ‘As the first smartwatch in our expanding line of premium wearable products, the Huawei Watch was designed and created to enhance and be part of the consumer’s everyday lives.’ Huawei continued the watch is made using 130 components and the steel is what’s known as ‘cold-forged’ making it 40 per cent stronger than standard steel. When the watch goes on sale it will be available in gold, silver and black and will have an interchangeable strap. The firm didn’t reveal battery life details but said it would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with the device. The watches (illustrated) will have sapphire crystal screens and a choice of 40 faces for the user . Huawei Watch will be available in more than 20 countries including United States, United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Norway, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates. Exact availability and pricing is expected to be announced at a future date in each of these regions separately. Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble told MailOnline: ‘2015 is set to be the biggest year yet for high-tech wrist candy, and Huawei’s smart watch is one of the most beautiful so far, if chunky timepieces are your thing. ‘Its sapphire crystal screen, 40 watch faces, and a rather classy optional leather strap make it all too easy to forget that it’s what’s inside that really counts. ‘4GB of internal storage and 512MB of RAM are rumoured to be exactly what the Apple Watch will offer. ‘It looks as though we already have an Apple Watch killer, or at least an arch nemesis powered by Android, on the scene.’","Huawei Watch runs Android Wear and links with phones on 4.3 and above .

"The U.S. could face a shortage of 90,000 doctors by 2025 as it struggles to cope with an older, sicker population and increased demand from Obamacare, a new report has warned. The dire need for doctors, particularly surgeons treating diseases common among elderly people, such as cancer, was revealed by the Association of American Medical Colleges on Tuesday. 'The doctor shortage is real – it's significant – and it's particularly serious for the kind of medical care that our aging population is going to need,' said Darrell G. Kirch, CEO and president of AAMC, which represents medical schools and teaching hospitals across the country. In its 2015 report, the association found that even though the supply of doctors will increase between now and 2015, the demand for physician services will fast out-grow this supply. Struggle: A graph shows the predicted demand for doctors compared to the predicted supply between 2013 and 2015. The demand is thanks to  the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and retail clinics, among other factors . Problem: The greatest shortage will be for surgeons, particularly those treating diseases among the elderly . The  number of physicians is expected to grow by nine per cent over the next ten years, but the demand for healthcare services could grown by up to 17 percent. It predicted there could be a shortfall of between 46,100 and 90,400 doctors in 10 years' time and, of these, there could be a shortage of as many as 63,700 non-primary care physicians. This is also considering how retail clinics and outpatient centers are turning more to nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other professionals instead of physicians, the report noted. When looking at the cause behind the increased demand, the association pointed to increased life expectancy. 'An increasingly older, sicker population, as well as people living longer with chronic diseases, such as cancer, is the reason for the increased demand,' Kirch told the Washington Post. The number of people over the age of 65 will soar by 40 percent by 2025, he said. The association also noted that the implementation of the Affordable Care Act will likely increase demand. But it will do so only minimally - increasing the need for doctors by two per cent. 'The trends from these data are clear,' Kirch said in a statement. 'The physician shortage will grow over the next 10 years under every likely scenario. Demands: The Association of American Medical Colleges, which compiled the report, has called upon the government to pay to train 3,000 more physicians a year in a bid to meet the growing demand . 'Because training a doctor takes between five and 10 years, we must act now, in 2015, if we are going to avoid serious physician shortages in 2025.' He called for more efficient care and more federal support to train at least 3,000 more students a year - at an estimated cost of $1 billion a year. The association did note that the shortfalls aren't as bad as predictions in the past; in a 2010 study, they said there would be a shortage of 130,600 physicians. The difference in predictions is thanks to revised population numbers and the slight rise in doctors completing medical school. The AAMC, which is based in Washington, D.C., represents all 141 U.S. medical schools and 17 in Canada, and 400 major teaching hospitals and health systems.","The Association of American Medical Colleges has warned that there could be a shortfall of between 46,100 and 90,400 doctors by 2025 .

"Horologist David Mitchell set 16 clocks on landmark buildings to midnight on his last day of work, because he is annoyed that no-one will replace him . Time is standing still in Swansea, because the keeper of the city’s clocks has stopped their hands in protest at the post he has held for 30 years being axed. Official horologist David Mitchell set 16 clocks on landmark buildings to midnight on his last day of winding up their complex workings by hand. The 72-year-old, who is retiring, has given council chiefs a ticking off for failing to replace him – and says the clocks will have to be left as they are for safety reasons. Mr Mitchell, who is the only fellow of the British Horological Institute based in South Wales, said he was ‘really wound up’ by the decision. He added: ‘I have been doing it since 1985 until I finished last week with no one to replace me. I stopped the clocks on safety grounds on Saturday. I didn’t want the weights falling over on the pulley systems. ‘Swansea has stopped. I was emotional doing my last rounds – except that I was angry with the council.’ Eight of the clocks are on council-owned buildings, such as the Guildhall. However, Wales’s second city also has a bye-law that says the council must take responsibility for maintaining eight clocks on private buildings, including St Mary’s Church and Morgans Hotel, which dates back more than 100 years. Council bosses are arguing that the privately-owned clocks should no longer be their responsibility, and say they intend to purchase an electric winding system to take care of the rest. But Mr Mitchell said that no action had been taken despite his best efforts to put plans in place for after his retirement. He said: ‘I even offered to do another year until it was resolved. When I was 65 I was asked to do an extra five years because nobody else would do the job. ‘I was happy to carry on for a while. I did another year after the extra five, and then another year. The 72-year-old, who is retiring, wanted to give council chiefs a ticking off for failing to replace him. Pictured: The clock is stopped at St Thomas Church . Mr Mitchell, who is the only fellow of the British Horological Institute based in South Wales, said he was ‘really wound up’ by the decision. Pictured: The clock at the city's Guildhall (left) and St Mary's (right) Eight of the stopped clocks are on council-owned buildings, such as the Guildhall, but the remaining eight are on private buildings, including St Paul's All Saints Church, Mumbles (pictured) ‘I offered to do another year if the council negotiated with the churches to get a grant to put electric winding in so they could be serviced by other people, as only the churches could get grants. 'I told the churches, out of politeness, and asked them to tell me when the council officially informed them. They haven’t informed them.’ Mr Mitchell added: ‘There is a an old bye-law in Swansea which gives the council responsibility for looking after public clocks. It is their responsibility.’ Mr Mitchell’s rounds also include the clocks on the city’s old police station, the Morriston Tabernacle Chapel, St Thomas Church and St Paul’s Church. Yesterday, all were pointing to 12 o’clock, much to locals’ surprise. Cash-strapped Swansea council believes private clocks should be cared for by their owners, including church authorities. Pictured: St Paul's Church, Swansea . It wants to use an electric winding system to control the clocks on the private buildings but is yet to have it installed, including at the old police station (left) and Morriston Tabernacle (right) Mr Mitchell said he wanted to keep working until the row was resolved. Pictured: The clock at Morgans hotel . Office worker Deirdre Spencer, 58, said: ‘It is all a bit strange because I’ve been looking at the Guildhall clock for years. They say time stands still for no one – but it does for Swansea council now.’ Fellow worker Donna Cadette, 60, said: ‘Everyone has mobiles now to check the time anyway but it is a real shame. It is a real shame. ‘It is part of our history to see the big clocks and to hear the chimes.’ Meanwhile, cash-strapped Swansea council has said that private clocks should be cared for by their owners, including church authorities. It added that it would resume maintenance of clocks in council buildings as soon as possible. A spokesman commented: ‘We are hopeful we can finalise the latest contract details quite quickly so clocks in council-owned buildings can continue running. ‘The long-term aim is to install automated winding systems into the council-owned clocks to provide a more efficient solution to reduce future costs.'","David Mitchell set 16 clocks on landmark buildings to midnight on last day .

"A mother left with mounds of overhanging skin after losing 10 stone through a gastric bypass  is begging to have it removed on the NHS so she can find love. Sarah Lord, of Wakefield, was a size 12 before she fell pregnant with her daughter Bryony, now 12. But after her relationship with Bryony's father came to an end four months into her pregnancy, she became depressed and gave into cravings and comfort eating. The 30-year-old was referred for bariatric surgery by her doctor, and went on to lose 10 stone, swapping a diet of fry ups and pies for stir fries and fruit. Sarah Lord, 30, lost 10st after a gastric bypass operation in September 2010, after ballooning to a size 24. She is pictured before (left) and after her weight loss (right), now back to a size 12 . Although she says she feels healthier after losing weight, Miss Lord has been left with a huge flap of excess skin which has ruined her confidence and left her too insecure to attract men or wear a bikini . Miss Lord had become depressed after a break-up four months into her pregnancy, and gained weight after turning to comfort eating (left). After her gastric bypass (right) she changed her diet and began exercising . The procedure has left her with a pouch of saggy skin around her waist, which she says has ruined her confidence and left her unable to attract men. Miss Lord, who works as a team leader for the Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'I've gained a lot of positives, but the saggy skin is holding me back from my happy ending. 'I'd like to have someone to share my life with - and no man can fancy me with all this excess skin. I need to get it removed. 'I've asked the NHS for another funded op - now I just need to hear back from my doctor to see if I qualify.' At 16 weeks into her pregnancy, Miss Lord's relationship with her daughter's father broke down. She said: 'The pregnancy was making me feeling anxious enough, and the breakup was very upsetting. I fell into a dip of depression, which I coped with through eating.' By the time Bryony was attending her first days at school, Miss Lord had ballooned six dress sizes and gained ten stone, leaving her at 22 stone and size 24. BEFORE . Breakfast: Bacon, egg and sausage sandwich . Lunch: Pie and chips . Dinner: Beef stew with Yorkshire pudding . Snacks: Crisps and chocolate . AFTER . Breakfast: Cereal . Lunch: Jacket potato and salad . Dinner: Chicken stir fry with vegetables . Snacks: Fruit and yoghurt . She said: 'I was in and out of hospital for various reasons. As my weight increased I seemed to be more prone to abscesses under my arms and on my bikini line. 'Friends thought I was bubbly and outgoing, but inside I was finding things really difficult. 'Whenever I found myself in an argument with anyone, my size was the first thing they would pick on, and it really hurt when they did. 'As people used harsh names, I became more and more reclusive.' Her depression reached such a state that she was recommended a course of antidepressants by her GP, but she decided against relying on drugs to improve her mood. Eventually, her doctor suggested that a NHS gastric bypass would combat her mounting health problems and attack the route cause of her depression. After an assessment she underwent the procedure at Dewsbury and District Hospital in September 2010. She said: 'Before the bypass I'd tried to lose weight in the gym, but nothing had ever worked. 'The weight loss after the operation was unbelievable. I lost eight stone in a year, and a further two the year after that. 'Instead of spending my evenings gorging on food I got involved in some intense boot camps at my local gym. There were moments after a heavy session where I could barely walk. 'I was exercising five times a week and the pounds were melting away.' Miss Lord, pictured part way through her weight loss (left), and now that she has lost 10 stone (right) says her excess skin has left her less confident than when she was overweight . She also completely overhauled her diet, further accelerating her weight loss. Before her operation, she typically ate a greasy bacon, egg and sausage sarnie for breakfast, followed by pie and chips for lunch. In the evenings she would tuck into comfort food like beef stew with Yorkshire puddings. She snacked on crisps and chocolate throughout the day. After the bypass, she enjoyed cereal for breakfast, followed by jacket potato and salad for lunch. For her evening meal she typically made chicken stir-fry with plenty of vegetables. When she snacks today, she indulges on fruit and yoghurt. While her physical appearance and general health improved, she found her confidence dipping. She said: 'There's absolutely no question about whether or not I feel healthier, but whether or not I feel more confident, that's a whole different story. 'In the past I was confident enough to meet up with men after meeting them on a night out, but I wouldn't do it again. I don't feel comfortable with my loose skin. 'Now whenever I find myself talking to a man at a bar I always make an excuse to leave early. I tend to just say ""I'm with someone else"". 'When I'm on holiday I'll always wear a modest swimsuit. I never wear anything tight around my stomach area.' Miss Lord is happy to be healthier after the gastric bypass, but desperately wants the NHS to remove the excess skin. Such a procedure would cost around £15,000 at a private clinic . She is now waiting for a green light from NHS bosses so that she can have an operation to remove the saggy skin from her waistline. The cost of such an operation from a private clinic would be around £15,000. She said: 'My GP has tried to get me funding for the operation four times but every time it has been denied. 'This is my fifth application for the saggy skin removal op so I am really hoping that I am eligible this time.' Despite her struggles with low confidence, Miss Lord said she has gained a lot of positives. She said: 'I feel much more freedom in my movement and my daughter Bryony looks up to me. I wouldn't want her to end up like how I did.' After weight loss, proteins in skin tear and break, resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength . Losing weight is the answer to many people's prayers. But they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side-effect: excess skin. This hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin, the dermis, which contains two proteins: elastin, which helps it retract, and collagen, for strength. When the skin is stretched too much through weight gain, these proteins tear and break, resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength. Unfortunately, while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat, the skin cannot retract. It is linked unpleasant health problems, from infections to back pain. Doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body. Factors that affect how much skin is left include age, how quickly the weight was lost (gastric bands are slower than bypasses, for example), and, for women, the number of children she has had. Many patients patients develop an 'apron' of skin around the abdomen, and loose skin under the arms, chest and inner thighs. This excess skin can cause a range of medical problems. One of the most common is intertrigo - a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry. Patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise. Excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo weight loss surgery.","Sarah Lord, 30, ballooned to 22st after the birth of her daughter Bryony .

"The new Republican governor of Illinois has said New Jersey is 'going down the drain' - despite it being run by fellow Republican Chris Christie, who sent $7million his way in the latest election campaign. Bruce Rauner said the Garden State was 'lost', thanks in part to its high property taxes. Rauner hit out at New Jersey, which has had Christie as governor since 2010, during a speech at the Illinois Farm Bureau last week. Sniping: Bruce Rauner, right, has said that New Jersey, the state run by his ally Chris Christie, left, is 'a disaster' because of its tax regime . Rauner's backer: Christie's Republican Governors Association gave $7million to Rauner's campaign in the 2014 governor elections . He said: 'We've got the highest property taxes in America other than New Jersey. I don't want to compete with New Jersey on anything, especially that. That's a disaster.' The State Register-Journal of Springfield, Illinois, reported that he continued: 'New Jersey is lost. They're going down the drain, and they ain't turning it around.' The staunch criticism may come as a surprise to Christie, who as the head of the Republican Governors Association funneled $7million in campaign funds to help him topple Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn. Christie often showed up on the campaign trail alongside Rauner, and boasted that he 'didn't come empty-handed' after making a $2.5million top-up to the coffers. He's behind you: Rauner, left, stands behind Christie during a Chicago fundraiser in which the two ate jumbo hotdogs . CBS Chicago reported how during the campaign Rauner and Christie made a public appearance to order jumbo hotdogs together before a hotel fundraiser. In return, Rauner has often been a vocal Christie fan. NJ.com reports that he has described him as 'one of the greatest public servants in America today' and 'a superstar'. Rauner spent a total of $37million on TV ads alone in the campaign, in which he outspent Quinn by some $9million, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The Center's records from the 2014 governor elections show Christie's association sent a total of $7million Rauner's way.

Speaking about the new meat and fish ranges, Nigel Broadhurst, Joint Managing Director at Iceland, said: 'Our new meat and fish ranges are fantastic alternatives to traditional meat and fish options.' He continued: 'The speciality meats are typically lower in fat and higher in protein, while most of the fish in our new range is naturally high in protein and rich in nutrients. 'Both of the new ranges are ideal for those looking to introduce quick, versatile and tasty meals into their diet.'

Last June, Tesco put free range ostrich meat on sale in 400 locations amid evidence the nation is developing a taste for exotic and unusual meat. And in December last year, Lidl was offering reindeer steaks and ostrich meat, and claimed it was unable to keep up with demand. Even  the discount chain Budgens has previously put squirrel on its shelves while Aldi offered ostrich kebabs in September 2014. Iceland is the latest high street store to offer exotic and unusual meats . The ostrich kebabs at Tesco are supplied by wholesaler DB Foods, which said a trial of Mossel Bay ostrich steaks at Britain's biggest supermarket in March 2014 had gone 'very well'. There are some ostrich farmers in the UK, however the meat being sold by Tesco comes from South Africa as the result of an exclusive deal with a farmer co-operative called Mosstrich. It is possible to buy Llama mince, imported from Chile, on Amazon plus many other exotic choices, ranging from zebra steaks and crocodile to kangaroo, camel and elk, from specialist suppliers. DB Foods is already supplying more than 2,000 High Street butchers and Whole Foods Market with the kebabs. Chief executive Ben Bayer said that ostrich was set to become increasingly visible to consumers. He said: 'It is our ambition to see ostrich become a mainstream meat. It's nutritional, has a great taste and is a healthy red meat.' Ostrich is a particularly healthy red meat, coming in at just three per cent fat, compared to around 10.5 per cent for beef, and 15.2 per cent pork.

"Troubled former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been pictured appearing to carry a bag with a bottle of gin inside just days after insisting he was healthy. The 47-year-old, who was briefly sectioned for his own safety in October, has had a lengthy battle with alcohol and drugs. But just last week while appearing on BT Sport's Matchday Live With Fletch and Sav show, he insisted that he hadn't fallen off the wagon and wasn't drinking again. Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne, who has been pictured near his home in Poole, Dorset, carrying a bag with what appears to be a bottle of gin inside . The midfielder, who retired from football in 2004, was wearing a coat, but no shirt, and also appeared to have sores around his mouth . Gascoigne was also pictured going into an Oddbins off licence and posing for a photograph with a member of staff and a bottle of lemonade . However, a week on from his successful TV appearance, new pictures have emerged showing Gascoigne walking close to his home in Poole, Dorset, clutching a bag containing what looks like a bottle of gin. The midfielder, who retired from football in 2004, was wearing a coat, but no shirt underneath, and appeared to have sores around his mouth. He was also pictured going into a local Oddbins off-licence and posed for a photograph with a member of staff and a bottle of lemonade. The new pictures come as the former Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United star recently joked about his addiction problems saying: 'I've been on a whiskey diet – I lost three days!' The star, put his recent stint in hospital following an apparent alcohol binge down to 'just to a little blip' The 47-year-old, who was briefly sectioned for his own safety in October, has had a lengthy battle with alcohol and drugs . The star, who put his recent stint in hospital following an apparent alcohol binge down to 'just to a little blip', insisted other photos of him shopping in a off-licence last month didn't mean he had resorted to his old habits. He told TV presenters Robbie Savage and Darren Fletcher on the BT Sport show: 'I was only buying cigarettes.' As well as making light of his dark times, the footballer also touched on the struggles of being in the spotlight. Just last week, Gascoigne appeared in good spirits on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show and joked about his alcohol problems . Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, was joined by fellow guest Russell Brand on the show and opened up about his struggles with alcoholism . He told fellow guests Jimmy Greaves and Russell Brand how his fundamental aim on a football pitch was to 'entertain the fans, win them over', but admitted that sometimes it all became too intense for him. He also admitted that even today 'it's sometimes hard to go to games' because he ends up 'analysing myself.' He added: 'I drive myself nuts. What would I have done there?' In December last year, Gascoigne was spotted popping to an off-licence in east London, although it wasn't clear whether he bought anything at the store. The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle footballer was also spotted emerging from an off-licence in east London in December last year. However, it was clear in the photos that he didn't buy alcohol .

While a month earlier he was pictured looking downcast as he put the bins out in front his property in the wealthy Sandbanks area of Dorset, wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slip-on shoes. The former professional footballer was hospitalised in October last year, during which he was placed on a three-day emergency detox. The star, who made 57 appearances for England, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel. His latest sectioning in the early hours of October 24 came following an apparent alcohol binge.

During his time in hospital, he is said to have taken the opportunity to improve his health and fitness by doing up to 800 press-ups, sit-ups and squats every day. Gascoigne, who now prays every morning, claimed he had only drunk for one year out of the last 18 and admitted he was lucky to have nipped his relapses in the bud quickly. Last month, he admitted that 'the only person who can save me is me', and vowed to stay on the straight and narrow after listening to doctors' warnings that alcohol will kill him.","New pictures have emerged of Paul Gascoigne walking near his home .

"A woman who was told she may never walk again after having a stroke aged 22 defied doctors to walk down the aisle to marry the love of her life. It was thanks to the quick thinking of her husband, Iain, that Kathryn Grainger was given the treatment she needed right away to survive having a stroke at such a young age. He spotted the signs her health was in serious danger when she woke up with a headache at 4am in July 2008. Kathryn had made enough of a recovery to walk down the aisle in 2012 to tie the knot with Iain . Kathryn, now 29, from Durham, recalls: 'I woke up thinking I was having a bad headache but Iain said, ""You're having a stroke"". 'To be honest I didn't know what a stroke was until I had mine. I was very confused and didn't know what was going on.' The fashion university student was taken to hospital and put into an induced coma to undergo surgery to remove her skull and reduce the swelling on her brain. But doctors warned her devastated boyfriend, then aged 24, and her parents Leslie and Miriam, that they could not be sure if she would be permanently brain damaged - and warned them she may never walk or talk again. Kathryn and Iain, pictured in 2010, at Berlin Zoo, one year after she suffered a stroke aged just 22 . Kathryn pictured as a child with her elder brother Christopher Thompson . Kathryn said of that difficult time: 'When I first woke up from my coma, I couldn't sit up, walk, speak or move. 'I could just about write with my right hand and couldn't see properly in my left eye. 'Although I was in shock I kept thinking I'd be okay to go back to university in September. 'I had no idea how bad I was. Iain knew though because he saw me with tubes and wires coming out of my head. He can't talk about it because he gets upset.' Kathryn's parents and Iain, who she had met through friends two years before her stroke, were determined to support her and nurse her back to health. She was also determined to regain her health and independence and didn't want to give up on her degree. Kathryn and Iain pictured with her father Leslie and mother Miriam at their wedding in 2012 . Kathryn defied doctors by walking down the aisle on her big day with Iain . Kathryn said: 'I stayed in the high dependency unit for two weeks. I was fed through a tube in my nose for months and then I went on to pureed food. 'The doctors told my parents I may not be able to walk again or talk. They didn't think I would get out of my chair, but I proved them wrong. 'I had physiotherapy, occupational and speech therapy. Slowly I re-learnt how to do things. I was really frustrated, as I'd lost the use of my left arm, as a fashion student that wasn't easy but the university did everything they could to help me and I graduated.' When she left hospital, Kathryn and Iain moved in with her parents in Durham and she began to make progress with their help, and that of Different Strokes in East End Pool, Newcastle, a project using cash raised by Red Nose Day to support stroke survivors. When Iain, a senior analyst in complaints, proposed on Christmas Eve 2011 Kathryn was even more determined to be able to walk again. The happy couple on their honeymoon in Paris in 2013 . Iain and Kathryn’s first trip to Paris in 2009 - before she suffered a stroke . 'All I could think of when I came out of hospital was that I wanted to walk down the street holding his hand again and we wanted to walked down the aisle arm-in-arm,' she said. She was able to do just that when they tied the knot a year later. Speaking about their big day, Kathryn said: 'I was in a wheelchair for five months after my stroke and I thought I would never walk again. 'Walking down the aisle with my dad on my wedding day, I felt so many different emotions. It's hard to describe the feeling but all I can really say is that it was one of the happiest moments of my entire life. 'My dad gave an amazing father of the bride speech. He said: ""After Kathryn had her stroke, most young lads would have left because she was so poorly but Iain stuck by my daughter and looked after her throughout."" 'Iain has really has supported me throughout everything; marrying him was the best day of my life.' The signs and symptoms of a stroke vary from person to person but usually begin suddenly. As different parts of your brain control different parts of your body, your symptoms will depend on the part of your brain affected and the extent of the damage. The main stroke symptoms can be remembered with the word FAST: Face-Arms-Speech-Time. The couple have now moved into their own home in Durham. Despite having to deal with having a stroke at such a young age, Kathryn says she doesn't feel sorry for herself. 'I'm a pretty positive person. I haven't let it get me down. It could have been so much worse,' she said. As well as the support of Iain and her family, she said Different Strokes made a huge contribution to her recovery so now she's urging people to support Red Nose Day on 13 March to raise money for such worthwhile projects. 'I found a Different Strokes group on Facebook and decided to go along. It was the first time I had spoken to people who had had a stroke. It was really helpful and I got some good advice from a physio and took part in gentle group exercises,' Kathryn said. 'Six years on I still have some things to improve on, like my speech. I'd love to be able to raise public awareness about strokes. 'It's the leading cause of disabilities but I didn't have a clue and you have to deal with it so quickly.' Red Nose Day is back on Friday 13th March. Money raised this Red Nose Day will help to transform lives here in the UK and across Africa.

"The House of Representatives . approved full fiscal-year funding for the United States' domestic security . agency on Tuesday, dealing a blow to conservative Republicans . who wanted Congress to hold out for a bill that included language blocking President . Barack Obama's recent executive orders on immigration. The House, 257-167, backed a Senate-passed funding . bill stripped of any immigration provisions, ending a bitter . fight that raised new questions about House Speaker John . Boehner's ability to manage fractious conservatives, who accused him of 'capitulation' after the Tuesday vote . Obama has said he will sign the funding bill for the . Department of Homeland Security, which spearheads domestic . counterterrorism efforts. Spending authority for the department . was scheduled to end at midnight on Friday. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio walks to the House chamber on Tuesday as it votes on funding for the Homeland Security Department without provisions attached to counter President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration.  They suffered embarrassing internal divisions that left the country within hours of a partial agency shutdown last week but passed a full fiscal-year funding bill today . The agency came within hours of a partial shutdown last week but the House approved a one-week extension of funding that was later approved by voice vote in the Senate and signed into law by the president. The drama began in December when the legislative branch passed a measure appropriating money to every single government agency through Sept. 30 but DHS, which it only funded through the end of February. Republicans hoped that once they took the majority in January they would have the resources to use the spending bill as a cudgel against Democrats. Yet after weeks of bickering, Boehner ultimately found himself last week  with few - . if any - viable procedural options to keep the agency open while . also satisfying conservatives who wanted the funding bill to . block Obama's executive actions last year lifting the threat of . deportation for millions of undocumented residents. Senate Democrats had repeatedly blocked a House-passed bill . that included the immigration provisions, while Obama and . Democrats backed a 'clean' funding bill passed by the Senate. 'What direction do we have?' House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters on Tuesday. Meanwhile, many of the GOP's rank and file seemed ready for the whole debacle to be over. 'It's time to move forward and stop playing these silly games,' Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Pennsylvania Republican, said. 'Let's prove to the American people that we're serious about protecting this homeland and that we have the capacity to govern.' 'Sanity is prevailing. I do give John Boehner credit,' New York Rep. Peter King said. Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho said he's against Obama's immigration directives, but the 'security of the homeland is one of our highest priorities.' Several Republicans said they would be better served by . putting their energy into legal strategies to overturn Obama's . immigration actions, which have been put on hold by the courts. 'This is where we must focus our actions,' said Republican . Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid applauded the passage of the House bill while opining that 'many weeks were wasted on political games that left us staring a Homeland Security shutdown square in the face.' 'If this ordeal teaches us one thing, it is that for the sake of our country we must stop governing by crisis,' he said, calling it an 'unnecessary showdown.' 'Common ground should be something we seek, not run away from – especially when the security of our nation is at stake. If we are going to get anything done, we must not be afraid of working together.' Taking a victory lap, Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine said in a statement that he looked forward to working with his fellow senators reforming the immigration process 'now that DHS funding is no longer being held hostage over the President’s immigration executive action.' Department of Homeland Security Chief Jeh Johnson said early Tuesday evening in a statement that Congress 'has done a good thing.' The Obama administration official thanked members 'who showed the leadership necessary to get the job done' and gave DHS personnel a 'vote of confidence in the importance of their work.' 'Now our men and women can return to the vital work of combatting terrorism, ensuring border security, port security, aviation security, cybersecurity, and our other vital homeland security missions, without the uncertainty of a furlough or a delayed paycheck hanging over their heads,' he said. Boehner went from high-flying on Tuesday to chagrined. He's pictured here on Tuesday morning with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after a joint meeting of Congress on Capitol Hill. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah applauds at right . Some conservatives said the House was making a mistake . by caving to Democrats' demands in the immigration battle. 'Yes, the recent court action gives us some hope that the Judicial Branch will finally rein in this lawless president,' Alabama Rep. Martha Roby said in a statement. 'However, I believe Congress had a responsibility to use its appropriations authority to stop this lawlessness and uphold the checks and balances that exist to protect liberty.' 'This is a very, very sad day,' said Republican . Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona. 'If we're not going to . fight now, when are we going to fight?' Conservative firebrand Steve King of Iowa argued that 'this is the signal of capitulation.' 'The mood of this thing is such that to bring it back from the abyss is very difficult.' House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte said he voted against the bill because 'the stakes are too high to surrender.' 'This fight is not about immigration; it’s about the Constitution and preserving the rule of law,' he asserted. 'If we don’t stop President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration, future presidents will continue to expand the power of the Executive Branch and encroach upon individual liberty. Goodlatte, a Virginia Republicans, said Congress must use 'all the tools' at its 'disposal to stop the President’s egregious abuse of authority.' His committee will consider a bill later this week that would prohibit the federal government from using funds to enact Obama's mandates. 'We must do all we can within our constitutional authority to stop President Obama’s lawlessness,' he said. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the greatest detractor of Obama's immigration actions in the upper chamber, vowed on Tuesday to keep battling. 'When it comes to defending our sovereignty there is no ""moving on,"" ' he said just before the House vote. 'Now is not the time for recrimination; now is the time for renewed determination.' 'Those who think this fight is over could not be more mistaken; it is only beginning,' he stated. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, center, flanked by Senator Chuck Schumer, left, and Dick Durbin, right, is pictured here on Tuesday at the Capitol. Reid applauded the passage of the House bill on Tuesday while opining that 'many weeks were wasted on political games that left us staring a Homeland Security shutdown square in the face.' Boehner told . Republican House members at a meeting on Tuesday that he wished they had more time to battle Obama but it was . time to allow a vote on the provision-free Senate bill. 'I am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president,' Boehner told his caucus, according to aides who spoke to the Associated Press. However, he said, 'I believe this decision — considering where we are — is the right one for this team, and the right one for this country.' 'Imagine if, God forbid, another terrorist attack hits the United States.' Rep. Luke Messer of Indiana, who chairs the Republican Policy Committee, offered a similar version of events to Reuters. 'The speaker made the case that he had hoped to continue to . fight for three more weeks. Obviously we didn't win that vote . last week, so we are where we are.' 'It's disappointing. I had hoped we'd be able to continue to . fight,' he said. Boehner allowed the use of a procedural motion to bring up . the Senate's funding bill, which passed the House with support . from both moderate Republicans and House Democrats. The bill provides nearly $40 billion in funding for the . agency, created after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, that secures . U.S. borders, airports, coastal waters and other critical . facilities. Without the funding, the agency would have been forced to . furlough about 30,000 employees, or about 15 percent of the . agency's workforce.

"Smartphone dating app Tinder launched a premium paid subscription version on Monday, but drew criticism over a pricing system that charges older users more. Tinder Plus, which has been tested since late last year, has subscription fees varying by age and country. In the US, users under 30 will pay $9.99 a month and older subscribers $19.99, according to a spokeswoman. Prices will be as low as $2.99 in emerging markets. Scroll down for video . Pay to play: Tinder launched a new paid version of their app on Monday called Tinder Plus. One of the features of the new app include the ability to take back a 'left swipe' - an action with eliminates a potential date. The new service will charge users over 30 $20 a month to use Tinder Plus . The new tiered plan raised some hackles, and the PhoneArena blog wrote that it 'quite frustratingly.. borders on age discrimination.' Tech blog Endgadget decried the pricing scale as 'sleazy.' But a Tinder spokeswoman defended the move. Hooking up all over the world: Another feature of Tinder Plus includes the ability to search for users in other locations, ahead of a vacation for example . 'We've priced Tinder Plus based on a combination of factors, including what we've learned through our testing, and we've found that these price points were adopted very well by certain age demographics,' spokeswoman Rosette Pambakian said in a statement. 'Lots of products offer differentiated price tiers by age, like Spotify does for students, for example. 'Tinder is no different; during our testing we've learned, not surprisingly, that younger users are just as excited about Tinder Plus, but are more budget constrained, and need a lower price to pull the trigger.' The app has spread widely among smartphone users, getting particular attention at the Sochi Olympics when athletes bragged about 'tindering' for fast hookups. 'With Tinder Plus we're giving our users access to their two most-requested features through Passport and Rewind, as well as unlimited liking capabilities.' The 'rewind' feature allows users to 'take back' a swipe, so if someone accidentally swipes left on a picture - rejecting a potential date - he or she can find that person again later. 'Rewind lets you take back your last swipe,' Tinder says. 'If you accidentally swiped left on someone you want to get to know, they're no longer lost in the Tindersphere forever. Now you can get him/her back with the touch of a button.' The 'Passport' feature allows users to change their location to match with people around the world, such as ahead of a planned vacation or business trip. 'Passport lets you change your location to connect with people anywhere around the world. It's like teleporting to a different location,' the blog said. Tinder, owned by the conglomerate IAC, has not confirmed reports saying the free version of its app will include advertising. With apps like Tinder, prospective daters can see pictures of people who are nearby. If they see someone they like, they can swipe right to indicate interest. People who both swipe right on each other's profiles can then contact each other.","The casual dating app launched a premium paid subscription called Tinder Plus on Monday .

"In the end, it was a birthday treat that took down one of Mexico's most powerful drug lord. Authorities had been monitoring a farm that they believed Servando Gómez Martínez, or La Tuta as he was known among members of the Knights Templar cartel, could possibly he using as a hideout, and thanks to the delivery of a chocolate cake from his girlfriend María Antonieta Luna Ávalos on his birthday, their suspicions were confirmed. Mexican security forces moved in on the hideout in Morelia, Michoacán on February 27, and were able to capture Martinez without firing a single shot. Scroll down for video . Servando Gómez Martínez (above), Mexico's most-wanted drug lord, was captured by authorities hiding out on a farm on February 27 . Authorities were able to locate him as they had been monitoring the farm (above), and grew suspicious when his girlfriend dropped him off a birthday cake . Martinez, known as La Tuta, was the head of the Knights Templar cartel, and previously worked as an elementary school teacher . The Washington Post reports that it was not just the cake that confirmed the location of Martinez, but also the communication habits of one of his most trusted messengers. While Martinez, 49, never used a cell phone, one messenger did, and would frequently communicate on his device travelling to and from the farm. Unbeknownst to that messenger however, his phone was being tracked. 'Michoacan now is in a better position,' said Federal Police Commissioner Enrique Galindo Ceballos said. 'The important parts of the [cartel] structure are neutralized.' The arrest was also an incredibly big boost for President Enrique Pena Nieto as he tries to deal with the increased gang violence in the country. Though frequently on the move, and at times living in caves to evade the authorities, Martinez still loved the spotlight, and would often release videos in which he criticized the government for supporting other drug cartels. He was also known to hand over cash for favorable press. The elementary school teacher turned drug lord portrayed himself as a hero in the numerous interviews he granted the media, though in recent years the violence inflicted by members of his cartel had become far more vicious, leading to citizens of the country doing everything they could to help law enforcement in their efforts to take down the organization. He frequently granted interviews with the media criticizing the Mexican government, and would pay cash for favorable press . Martinez was also known to hide out in caves (above) to evade law enforcement . The arrest come less than a year after two of the cartel's most violent members, his sons Luis Alfredo Aguilera Esquivel and Huber Gómez Patiño, were captured by authorities. With this arrest authorities now believe the Knights Templar cartel may collapse, as almost all the organization's leaders have been captured. Martinez's group alone, La Familia Michoacana, controlled some 50 methamphetamine labs across Mexico while also making millions from a variety of illegal activities, among them extortion and kidnapping. The United States charged him under the Kingpin Act in 2010, making it illegal for any Americans or American companies to do business with him, and freezing all his assets in this country. Martinez is now being held in a maximum security prison. He had long said that he would rather be killed than put behind bars. Flavio Gomez, Martinez's brother, was arrested during the same raid.","Servando Gómez Martínez, Mexico's most-wanted drug lord, was captured by authorities hiding out on a farm on February 27 .

"A mother-of-one has told of the horrifying moment she and her family checked into a hotel room on the New South Wales' Central Coast, which she described as a 'crime scene'. Sydney woman Melanie, her partner and seven-year-old son booked two nights at the Apollo Resort in Wamberal from February 13 to attend a friend's wedding on booking.com. The cost of staying at the resort was $285 in total. Melanie and her family checked into the Apollo Resort in Wamberal, NSW and found two pairs of dirty underwear . The first signs of trouble came when the young family were escorted to their room up 'terribly old-looking staircase' and saw the dirty marks on the walls of the 'dimly lit hallway', which scared Melanie's son. When they walked into their room the trio found an empty syringe packet on the floor, white stains on the floor and two pairs of dirty underwear in the bin. But the nightmare did not end there. Melanie said there was a used mini bottle of body wash in the soap tray in the bathroom, a filthy toilet bowl and 'a wasp nest cocoon inside the thick maroon curtains'. The family also found an empty syringe packet on the floor near the bed inside the room . When they lifted up the sheets they found dry rice stuck to the blanket . 'Out on the grubby balcony, there was a bottle cap on the ground from the previous guest, cigarette ash and dirt all over the ground, dirty tiles and incredibly cheap furniture - not a ""resort"" by any means,' she said. 'I walked into a spider web when opening the door so I turned my phone camera on to look for spiders and the underneath of the small, rusty table was infested with them.' A strong smell of bleach wafted into the room, which Melanie assumed must of been from the 'green and un-swimmable' pool as described by other TripAdvisor reviews. 'Being five months pregnant, I couldn't stand the smell and quickly went back inside,' she said. There were also white stains on the carpet. Melanie described the room as a 'crime scene' The window sills were covered in dirt and dust, and looked like they had not been cleaned in a long time . The final straw was the airconditioner in the room, which smelt 'terrible' when it was turned on. 'My partner opened it up and the filters were full of dust. Our son has bad asthma so we turned it straight off and took a photo of it on my phone,' Melanie said. 'The furnishings were terrible, even the insides of the bedside lampshades were peeling and everything felt unclean. I did not want to touch anything. 'My son told me he was scared and the place was ""creepy"" and asked if we had to stay there.' Then Melanie's partner found two pairs of underwear in the bin - a 'very worn-out pair of male jocks and a torn, small pink female G-string'. 'I wanted to vomit. We couldn't believe our eyes - no one deserves to go through that - the place should be closed down,' Melanie said. The inside of the lamp was brown and grimy. Melanie said she did not want to touch anything . A small rusty table outside on the balcony was was infested with spiders and cobwebs . Daily Mail Australia has attempted to contact the Apollo Resort. But owners of the hotel told news.com.au their staff cleaned rooms every day. 'In the past, the guests provided us a constructive comments or requests in the Comment Sheet in each of rooms or speak with us directly. We answer it quickly,' a spokesman said. The saga of her trouble with Apollo Resort did not end there for Melanie who left the same day she checked-in. Despite being told by the manager of the hotel she would not be charged a cancellation fee of $285. She received an email the following morning saying the hotel would be charging them for being a 'no show. Melanie found a used mini bottle of body wash on the soap dish inside the shower . There was brown scaling that had not been cleaned up at the bottom of the toilet . On the way up to the room, a dirty hand mark was seen on the wall of the hall way . 'This seemed like a kick in the face from the nightmare we experienced. I immediately responded back to them, and included photos from my phone and explained that we did arrive, we did check-in, then checked back out within 30 minutes as it's not safe for patrons,' she said. 'A few emails went back and forth and eventually [on February 16] I have now received an email saying the hotel has advised we have been cancelled without penalty.' But the incident is not an isolated one. Apollo Resort's TripAdvisor page is full of reviews slamming the hotel. One woman labels it 'Fawlty Towers without Basil' while another reviewer says describing it as 'disgusting is an understatement'. A user named Rochellemaree said her room had 'rodent poo everywhere'. 'Never have I been so disgusted,' she wrote. 'The staff member didn't seem at all surprised or alarmed and offered me another room. 'The airconditioning in the second room was broken and stuck on freezing all night. I had to sleep under a blanket from the second bed. 'The shower door and shower head were filthy and covered in mould. 'In the morning, I pulled out a chair to sit on and it was also covered in rodent faeces.'","Melanie, partner and son checked into Wamberal's Apollo Resort in NSW .

"An audio recording offering further evidence Fox News host Bill O'Reilly lied in his book Killing Kennedy has been aired by CNN. In his book, O'Reilly claimed he heard the blast when George de Mohrenschildt - an associate of President John F. Kennedy's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald - killed himself with a shotgun in Florida. CNN's Reliable Sources played an audio recording from 1977 where a young O'Reilly is heard talking about traveling to Florida to cover de Mohrenschildt's suicide. An audio recording released by CNN proves Bill O'Reilly (above) lied in his best-selling book Killing Kennedy . The Fox host claimed in Killing Kennedy, (right) that in 1977 he 'heard' the fatal shotgun blast in the suicide of George de Mohrenschildt (left) who gave testimony at the investigation into President Kennedy's death . O'Reilly, 65, was covering the JFK assassination for Dallas, Texas, television station WFAA at the time. In his book, O'Reilly wrote: 'In March of 1977 a young reporter knocked on the door of de Mohrenschildt's daughter's home. 'He heard the shotgun blast that marked the suicide of the Russian. 'That reporter's name is Bill O'Reilly.' The recording, which was originally published by former Washington Post reporter and author Jefferson Morely on his website JFKFacts.org in 2013, seems to prove that claim is false. In the high-quality recording CNN aired on Sunday, O'Reilly can be heard calling investigator Gaeton Fonzi to confirm de Mohrenschildt's suicide. He also talks about coming to Florida, meaning there is no way he could have been on de Mohrenschildt's doorstep to hear the shotgun blast. In the tape, O'Reilly said: 'I'm coming down there tomorrow. 'I'm coming to Florida. 'I'm gonna try to get a night flight out of here, if I can. 'But I might have to go tomorrow morning.' Fox released figures showing O'Reilly's weekly audience  is up 11 per cent compared with  last year . Morley told Media Matters Reilly's claim about overhearing the gunshot in de Mohrenschildt's suicide is 'just not true'. He added: 'It is what these guys all do, they inject themselves into a dramatic situation. 'O'Reilly was chasing this story, but he wasn't there, he made it sound like he was more on the scene than he was, it was show business.' Former WFAA reporter Tracy Rowlett echoed those sentiments. He said: 'Bill O'Reilly's a phony, there's no other way to put it. 'He was not up on the porch when he heard the gunshots, he was in Dallas. 'He wasn't traveling at that time.' Fox News did not comment about the matter and referred Daily Mail Online to book publisher Henry Holt & Co. Henry Holt spokesperson Patricia Eisemann said: 'We fully stand behind Bill O’Reilly and his bestseller Killing Kennedy and we’re very proud to count him as one of our most important authors. 'This one passage is immaterial to the story being told by this terrific book and we have no plans to look into this matter.' A Fox News spokesperson previously told Daily Mail Online: 'Bill O'Reilly has already addressed several claims leveled against him. 'This is nothing more than an orchestrated campaign by far left advocates Mother Jones and Media Matters. 'Responding to the unproven accusation du jour has become an exercise in futility. FOX News maintains its staunch support of O'Reilly, who is no stranger to calculated onslaughts.' On Friday, Fox News released figures showing O'Reilly's weekly audience grew by 11 per cent compared with the same period last year, the Washington Post reported.","Fox News host has said in books and on television he 'heard' George de Mohrenschildt commit suicide with a shotgun at a Florida home in 1977 .

"A woman dug up her father's grave in search of his 'real will' but found only vodka and cigarettes. Melanie Nash, 53, was one of four accused in the plan to open Eddie Nash's vault in Colebrook, then rifle through his casket last May in a scene a prosecutor compared to an Edgar Allan Poe story. Police said she felt she was shorted in her share of the inheritance after her father died in 2004. They didn't find a will in the casket. Plot: Melanie Nash (left), 52, is pleaded guilty to conspiring to remove her father Eddie's remains from Colebrook Village Cemetery in New Hampshire in May of last year. Mr Nash (right) died of a heart attack in 2005 . Ransacked: The vault of Mr Nash was found cracked with the casket opened and his remains ransacked . His body was left intact. Nash, who faced trial in March, instead agreed to plead guilty to charges of criminal mischief, interference with a cemetery, conspiracy and abuse of a corpse on Monday. Her sentencing is scheduled for May 5. Two others pleaded guilty; a third person was acquitted. Melanie Nash told police: 'All this was done for the right reasons and I know my father would be OK with it' Nash told police she did not receive anything when her father died and had been thinking of digging up the grave for years to prove that her sister, Susie Nash, 'hid the will.' Susie Nash has said there was only one will when her father's estate plan was done in 1995 and everyone involved knew about it. In a written statement to police last June, Melanie Nash wrote that she met up with the others to go to the cemetery. She wrote: 'All this was done for the right reasons and I know my father would be OK with it.' She ended her statement with: 'What we all did was to dig up my father's coffin, Eddie Nash, looking for documents. We did it with respect.' However, after ransacking her father's remains, Nash found only a packet of cigarettes in his hand, a police affidavit said. 'You hear of grave robbing 100, 150 years ago,' Jenkins and Newman Funeral Home Director Michael Pearson told the station WMUR last year. Successful: Mr Nash, a one-time dairy farmer, started a successful heavy equipment business in 1979, still run by his family . 'You don't think of it in 2014.' Her lawyer argued her statements were given before she was informed of her right against self-incrimination. But a judge ruled that she freely came to the police station after a warrant had been issued for her arrest and voluntarily gave her statements. Mr Nash died of a heart attack at 68, started an equipment business in 1979 still run by his family. Mr Nash, a one-time dairy farmer, started a successful heavy equipment business in 1979, still run by his family. The Colebrook-based company, which employs 30 workers, sells second-hand backhoes, skidders and dozers all over the U.S. and Canada . After her sister pleaded guilty, Susie Nash told The Caledonian Record that she is relieved the case is at last resolved but that the effects will linger. 'It still leaves an impact on you,' she said. 'Every time I visit the cemetery, I will be thinking of this.' Mr Nash has since been reburied.","Melanie Nash, 53, was  accused in the plan to open Eddie Nash's vault in Colebrook .

"Tragic: Five-month-old Leo Radcliffe died on June 4 2010, hours after his mother phoned for help . A baby died from meningitis after the on-call doctor asked to examine him failed to turn up and instead left his worried parents a phone message to say he was ‘very busy’, an inquest heard. Leo Radcliffe’s mother had rung NHS Direct after the five-month-old boy was taken ill overnight with a high temperature and heavy breathing. A call handler from the privately run Go-To-Doc scheme passed the call to duty GP Dr Jason Tahghighi with a message saying he needed to visit the family because they had no transport to get to hospital or money for a taxi. Instead of instructing his driver to take him to their address, however, he left two voicemail messages on Leo’s mother’s mobile phone asking her to contact him. When she failed to answer, he assumed the family were asleep and that Leo was OK, made a ‘likely diagnosis’ of a viral illness and concluded that a visit was ‘not necessary’, the hearing was told. But four hours later, Leo developed a tell-tale rash on his forehead, and although his parents called an ambulance he died later in hospital. After being challenged over what happened, Dr Tahghighi initially lied about having attended the house and claimed the lights were switched off when he arrived. He even described the street and area, claiming it was ‘dark’ and ‘scruffy’ before coming clean. His mother, Katie Corry, now 23, told the hearing in Manchester that in the hours before he died in June 2010, Leo had become unsettled and started making a ‘whimpering noise’ while out in his pram. Back at their home in Chadderton, Oldham, he refused food, and she and Leo’s father Kaine Radcliffe, 25, a labourer, noticed a rise in his temperature. She gave him baby paracetamol, but he continued to struggle and was breathing heavily, although there was no sign of a rash. Shortly before midnight she rang the NHS Direct helpline, which has since been replaced by the non-emergency 111 service, and then told a health adviser from Go-To-Doc about Leo’s condition. Miss Corry said Leo felt ‘really, really hot, like boiling hot’. His case was referred to the on-call doctor with the message in capital letters: ‘NO MONEY NO TRANSPORT, VISIT.’ Scroll down for video . 'Lies': Dr Jason Tahghighi, right outside court yesterday, said that he had been to the family home and that he hadn't knocked because the lights were off, it was heard. Left, Leo's parents Katie Corry and Kaine Radcliffe . Leo’s exhausted parents then fell asleep, and when Miss Corry woke up four hours later she realised she had two voicemails. ‘Leo was beside me and I saw a purple rash on his forehead,’ she said. ‘I got a glass and put it on the rash because I knew it was meningitis.’ Symptoms: Leo Radcliffe, pictured, had been suffering a high temperature and heavy breathing . Her partner called an ambulance but Leo died later that day at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. His family has since received an apology from Go-To-Doc. Dr Tahghighi, 47, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, was later suspended for 12 months for misconduct by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. His first voicemail message said: ‘We are very busy with visits. Maybe he can wait until the morning.’ The second said: ‘As you haven’t called back I’m assuming that your son Leo is doing OK and settled down. I would suggest a follow-up with your GP some time during open hours. However, I would like you to phone us back with any concerns.’ Dr Tahghighi said that at the time he had been working an ‘excessive number of shifts’, including six that required him to cover if a doctor rang in sick as well as seven days at his surgery in Bramhall and five overnight shifts lasting from 11pm to 7am. When asked if he had been ‘too busy’ to see Leo, he said: ‘I don’t know the reason I didn’t visit. I had the four visits come in at once. ‘I felt with no call back, I just assumed that everything was fine and settled. I should have attended but I was under a considerable amount of stress at the time. I admit working an excessive number of hours.’ The inquest continues.

"Colorado resident Bill Feldman was worried sick when his beloved dog went missing, so when he got a call from his neighbor hours later telling him that his pet was at his house, he was relieved. But then Mr Feldman learned that his pooch Henry has attacked a cat, and that his neighbor was not going to release him until all of the injured animal's veterinarian bills were paid in full, and then some. After five hours of tense ransom negotiations, Feldman called police to report that Henry was being held hostage. Scroll down for video . Dog-napped! Bill Feldman says his beloved rescue dog, Henry (pictured left and right), was held for ransom by a neighbor after running away from home and attacking a cat last month . Runaway: Henry, a black-and-white mix, took off from his owner's estate in Morrison, Colorado, last month . Four-legged troublemaker: The pooch reportedly got inside a nearby home, where he attacked the owner's cat . The rambunctious black-and-white pup took off from Feldman’s mansion located in the Denver suburb of Morrison last month. After attacking a neighbor's cat, the pooch found himself shut in behind a gate up a hill. Ironically, Feldman's pet, a rescue dog, was the inspiration behind his new invention: a wrist band that hooks up to a leash to keep pet owners' hands free during walks. After scouring the surrounding area in search of his missing dog, Feldman got the call that Henry has been detained by the neighbor for injuring his pet cat. ‘I said I’m so sorry for your cat and i volunteered to absolutely take care of the vet bills and he said, “Well, that’s good because you’re not going to get your dog back until all those vet bills are paid for,”’ Feldman told the station KDVR. The medical costs amounted to $325, but Feldman said his neighbor expected a bigger payout. Feldman, a US Navy veteran and a Maine native, launched his burgeoning business, Liberty Wristbands, last July featuring Henry as the face of the brand selling hands-free leash holders at $29.99 each.

"Paul Britton, pictured arriving at the employment tribunal in Reading, Berkshire, claims he was called a 'paedo' and forced to get changed in a disabled toilet during a campaign of abuse . A gay swimming instructor was called a 'paedo' by his manager ordered to get changed in a disabled toilet away from others, a tribunal heard today. Paul Britton claims he was referred to as a 'f****t' and a 'gayboy' and was told he should not be teaching young children, during a campaign of abuse by leisure centre colleagues. Staff members also sent him lewd photographs on Snapchat - including one featuring a workmate in a mankini - in a bid to hound him out of his job, the hearing was told. The homosexual instructor, who is also a trainee lawyer, told a judge that managers at the leisure centre had tried to make his life unbearable because he had exposed their 'lies' at an employment tribunal where he represented a disabled colleague. He told the tribunal that he had worked at the centre for three years without incident prior to the tribunal, which resulted in his employers having to pay out a hefty settlement. Shortly after that, he claimed his line manager, Graham Ashby, started the tirade of homophobic abuse. The 31-year-old said the campaign of abuse began in June 2013, when Mr Ashby called him a 'greedy gay' after overhearing him tell a colleague he was going to order a Dominos pizza. 'I was deeply upset about this comment and completely offended,' he told the tribunal in Reading, Berkshire. A month later he said Mr Ashby ordered him not to use the male changing rooms as it was 'inappropriate' and told him to use the disabled toilet instead. 'When I asked him why, he explained that if I was to use the male communal changing area it would be like him using the female changing area. 'I did not want to give Graham Ashby a reason to discipline me or give me a hard time, especially in front of others. The tribunal heard Mr Ashby then approached the experienced swimming instructor and told him it was 'wrong' for him to teach children. 'When I asked him why, he asked me if I was a Tory. I responded, I told him that I was a Conservative to which he said 'gay and Tory can mean only one thing'. 'I asked him 'what does that mean then?' to which he laughed and said 'paedo' and walked away. 'I was deeply offended and so shocked that I had to go home, saying that I felt unwell.' Mr Britton, who lives in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, told the tribunal that he had felt increasingly ostracised when he returned from work after successfully representing disabled colleague Dale Moore at an employment tribunal. The pair worked together High Wycombe Sports Centre, which is run by Parkwood Leisure, based in Bishops Stortford. 'When I returned to work relationships became strained for me. I had questioned and interrogated a number of senior managers at Parkwood whilst at the tribunal. 'I felt that my support of Mr Moore had been seen as negative by those that employed me. I felt ostracised by those that were involved in the Dale Moore case.' Among the torrent of abuse was a series of images sent to him on social networking app Snapchat showing colleagues in lewd and compromising positions, the tribunal heard. Mr Britton, dressed in a smart pinstripe suit and white shirt, told the hearing that the photos were sent by colleague Ben Mitchell which included an image of his flatmate and a fellow leisure centre employee, William Stroud, wearing a revealing mankini. Mr Britton told the tribunal that he had felt increasingly ostracised when he returned from work at High Wycombe Sports Centre (pictured) after successfully representing disabled colleague Dale Moore at an employment tribunal . Another photo featured an image of Mr Mitchell containing the words 'waistcoat...no shirt...gay cowboy' and a different picture of him headbutting a melon. 'I took this as a direct threat to my personal safety and I was fearful,' said Mr Britton. He told the judge he had found the images degrading and disgusting and thought they were homophobic. However, when he complained to Mr Ashby, the manager told him to 'lighten up' and that it was just 'banter.' He told the hearing that Mr Ashby had also made jibes about his hair loss including saying 'here comes the bald queer' which he described as 'very hurtful.' 'I believe that Graham Ashby's comments were made because he does not like homosexuals and that he would do anything to be nasty and create difficulties for me at work because of my assistance to Dale Moore in 2012. 'I had started to question my sexuality which I had never done before. I no longer wanted to get out of bed in the mornings. I had stopped going to the gym to train and to the pool to swim leisurely. I did not want to leave the house. I was frightened to go to the sport centre.' He also claimed that, in another incident, Duty Manager Joel Hoyte told him to take off his wetsuit by the poolside in front of a young boy, even though he said he had nothing on underneath. 'Mr Hoyte's behaviour towards me was aggressive,' he added.' I thought he was going to physically attack me in the pool. He was so angry and hostile towards me. The public and staff that were present were completely silent.' Mr Britton told the hearing that he had now given up hope of resuming his teaching career. 'I'm effectively prohibited from using pools near to me because of the events and the individuals,' he said. Defending the centre, Jeff Middleton said his claims of homophobia were not true and added: 'You left because you didn't want the practice on one to ones to change and you didn't like being told not to wear your wetsuit in the pool.' Colleagues of Mr Britton agreed he had been 'singled out' for abusive treatment because he was gay. Former centre manager Michael Walker told the tribunal that the 31-year-old had been overlooked for a promotion because of his sexuality. He said superior Mr Ashby, told him in a meeting that he did not think a 'gay' should run the swimming school because 'we might lose customers.' Mr Walker added that staff had been told to 'keep the heat off' Mr Ashby and said: 'In essence he was untouchable and was allowed to operate outside of the normal rules . 'Almost every month Graham Ashby would ask me to check Paul Britton's timesheets. He never told me why, not did he ever ask me to do this for any of the other swimming instructors.' Leisure assistant Mark Gee spoke of the bullying culture at the centre and said the environment was 'the worst I have worked in.' 'Joel Hoyte likes to throw his weight around...he is power hungry. He said to me once in staff training that he likes the fear he induces,' he said. He added that Nicola Allen, who was chairing a grievance hearing into the dispute, told him that homophobic remarks such as 'alright gayboy' were 'banter' and 'part of the environment of working in leisure.' Swimming instructor Alex Jones recalled an incident when Mr Ashby made apparently derogatory remarks about Mr Britton's partner. He said he was in the swim office with Mr Britton and his partner Daniel Beech when Mr Ashby walked in and said 'Paul and I are going to run away together.' When Mr Britton explained that Mr Beech was his boyfriend, Mr Ashby said 'each to their own' before waving his hands in the air and walking off. 'I did not know if Graham Ashby's comments were made because Paul Britton and Daniel Beech are homosexual and that he disapproved of their relationship, or if it was because Daniel Beech is half Chinese. 'I do believe either of the reasons for his comment would have made it inappropriate to say and clearly, in my opinion, discriminatory in nature.' The tribunal was adjourned until tomorrow.","Paul Britton the target for abuse by staff at High Wycombe Sports Centre .

"A young actor was inspired to come out of the closet after featuring in a movie about homophobia in Australia. Harry Cook, 23 from Sydney, was always advised in the past not to divulge that he was gay because it would limit the variety of acting variety roles he would be offered. But when he took on the role  in the movie, Drown, which premieres on Wednesday night and tells of the struggles for gay men in the macho sporting arena, he decided to reveal his sexuality to the world in the form of a YouTube video. Scroll down for video . Harry Cook was inspired to come out of the closet after featuring in a movie about homophobia in Australia . Drown tells the story of the threat and confusion felt by the local surf lifesaving champion when he has his title taken off him a by a new club member who happens to be gay . The 23 year-old (right) was always told by his agents not to divulge that he was gay because it would limit the variety of acting variety roles he would be offered . 'I was always told to keep my mouth shut - it was ridiculous,' he said. 'I was told only gay people played gay roles and straight people got all of the straight roles. 'It's like saying I can't play Nemo because I'm not a fish.' Drown tells the story of the threat and confusion felt by the local  surf lifesaving champion when  he has his title taken off him a by a new club member who happens to be gay. Although Harry doesn't play a gay character  - the theme of the movie was something that he could deeply relate to as he felt 'very shady and secretive'. The defining moment when Harry decided he could no longer live a lie was when he was directly asked if he was gay in a radio interview just after filming finished up just a year ago. 'I completely shut down and said something like ""that's personal"",' he said. 'Then I decided I couldn't keep living like that - I was lying to myself and not being who I am.' Although Harry doesn't play a gay character - the theme of the movie was something that he could deeply relate to as he felt 'very shady and secretive' Harry decided he could no longer live a lie was when he was directly asked if he was gay in a radio interview just after filming finished up just a year ago . So, Harry made the very brave decision to tell the entire world that he was gay through a You Tue video in December 2013. 'A lot of actors said they applauded my bravery but they could never do what I did which I think is a really sad way to live,' he said. 'It felt really good - it was a huge weight off my shoulders because I felt I had been hiding a lot.' 'Whenever I was asked I would avoid the question and get out of it.' The response from the coming out video was overwhelmingly positive with more than 70,000 views. 'They were even talking about it on TV in America - I was shocked how much of an effect it had,' he said. 'I just wanted to say this is who I am and thought it was no big deal but I received mind-blowing beautiful responses and only a couple of negative ones but nothing too brutal.' Harry moved to Los Angeles a year ago to try to break into Hollywood which has made him notice that Australia still has a lot to learn when it comes to accepting homosexuals as equals in society. 'It's quite frightening how clear it is now that I have lived here - I knew it wasn't up to scratch with everybody else - I knew we were lacking a bit when it came to equality but I just didn't realise how bad it was,' he said. 'The U.S. has got 50 states and I think 37 now has got same sex marriage while none of them do in Australia - I think it's one of the last countries in the western world to be completely against it which I find very sad.'

"Males of a species of crab, nicknamed after David Hasselhoff because of their hairy chests, spend largely separate lives from the females, according to new research. In a study looking at the private life of the deep-sea crab known as the 'Hoff' have found that the males and females spend separate lives at volcanic vents 1.5 miles deep near Antarctica. This, according to the British research, is because of the conflicting demands of feeding and raising young among the sexes. Males of a species of crab, nicknamed after David Hasselhoff because of their hairy chests, spend separate lives from the females, according to new research. In a study looking at the private life of the deep-sea crab known as the 'Hoff' have found that the males and females spend separate lives at volcanic vents . The Hasselhof crab was discovered in 2012  living around volcanic vents off South Georgia. It is a type of yeti crab recognised for their hairs, or setae, along their and limbs that they use to cultivate the bacteria which they eat. The new are slightly different in that they exhibit long setae on their undersides. They were named after actor David Hasselhof because of his hairy chest. Despite living apart from females, the males live in remarkable density. In some places, scientists say the crabs reach as many as 600 individuals per square metre. In 2010, a British expedition revealed a 'lost world' of deep-sea animals including the crab named after the Baywatch star thriving on the ocean floor near Antarctica. Using a deep-diving remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to examine the distribution, size and sex of these crabs at the vents, Dr Leigh Marsh and colleagues from the University of Southampton have now pieced together their private lives. Dr Marsh said: 'The life cycles of deep-sea animals have been largely hidden from us until now but thanks to more frequent expeditions and advances in technology, we are getting a clearer picture of the natural history of the ocean depths that cover most of our world.' The researchers found that large male Hoff crabs live highest on the mineral spires of the deep-sea vents, closest to the hot fluids that jet from them. A university spokesman said: 'At the base of the mineral spires, smaller males mingle with females in spectacular piles, many crabs deep, where they get together to mate. 'The females then crawl away from the bustling piles of crabs and the warm mineral-rich fluids seeping from the seafloor, which can be toxic to their young. 'Away from the mineral spires, the few crabs found by the researchers were all females, carrying developing offspring under their curled-up tails. Males don't share in 'child-care' arrangements with the females, and can climb up the mineral spires of the vents to take advantage of the warmth and conditions best suited for growing bacteria on their hairy chests . 'Moving away from the warmer waters of the spires takes the females across a gauntlet of predators, such as large sea anemones and seven-arm sea stars. 'Away from the vents, the cold water of the deep Antarctic also slows down the metabolism of the adult female crabs, making them less active than in the warmer waters of the jostling piles. 'However, the conditions away from the vents may be more stable and less harmful to their offspring for their early development, making the journey of the females worthwhile. Males, meanwhile, don't share in 'child-care' arrangements with the females, and instead can climb up the mineral spires of the vents to take advantage of the warmth and conditions best suited for growing bacteria on their hairy chests. By scraping off and eating these bacteria using comb-like mouthparts, the males can grow much larger than the females. Study co-author Dr Jon Copley said: 'Deep-sea vents are island-like habitats on the seafloor, and discoveries like these show that our exploration of the life that thrives around them has only just begun.' The Hasselhof crab was discovered in 2012 living around volcanic vents off South Georgia. It is a type of yeti crab recognised for their hairs, or setae, along their and limbs that they use to cultivate the bacteria which they eat.  They were named after actor David Hasselhof (pictured) because of his hairy chest .","Large male Hoff crabs live highest on the mineral spires of Antarctica .

"City officials have apologized for saying 12-year-old Tamir Rice 'directly caused' his own fatal shooting by police while he brandished a pellet gun. Lawyers for the city of Cleveland, Ohio, prompted outrage by making the claim as they responded to a wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of the boy's distraught family. An officer shot Tamir dead just two seconds after he encountered the boy playing in a park with his sister on November 22 - despite the initial caller telling police the gun was 'probably fake'. Scroll down for video . 'Insensitive': The mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, has apologized for a response to the wrongful death lawsuit which blamed 12-year-old Tamir Rice (above) for his fatal shooting by police on November 22 . 'Directly caused by his own acts': The offending part of the court documents which were filed last week . Innocent: The city has said that Tamir (above) failed 'to exercise due care to avoid injury' when he was shot by police officer Timothy Loehmann. An initial caller told a dispatcher the gun was 'probably fake' Yet the lawsuit response said Tamir's 'injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by' his own acts. Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson has now apologized for the wording of the response and said it will be changed in the next three weeks after he spokes to Tamir's family. 'In an attempt to protect our defenses, we used words and phrased things in such a way that was very insensitive to the tragedy in general and the victim in particular,' he told reporters. 'We are apologizing to the family and the citizens of the city of Cleveland for our poor use of those words, and our insensitivity for the use of those words.' He added: 'We are sincerely apologetic for our misuse and mischaracterization of our answer to that complaint.' The court documents filed late last week by the city said Tamir's injuries and the subsequent complaints for damages stemmed from his actions and failure 'to exercise due care to avoid injury.' 'Sincerely apologetic': Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson (right) said the wording about Tamir (left) will change . Shock: Tamir, 12, was shot dead (above) by a police officer two seconds after arriving on the scene even though the boy was holding a pellet gun. His sister was handcuffed after running towards him . NOTE: Plaintiffs are Tamir's family, and plaintiffs' decedent is Tamir himself . 215. Plaintiffs' decedent's injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by the failure of Plaintiffs' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury. 216. Plaintiffs' decedent's injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by the acts of Plaintiffs' decedent, not this Defendant. 217. Plaintiffs' injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by their own acts, not this Defendant. It said the Defendant, police officer Timothy Loehmann, was in no way responsible with all blame resting on the 12-year-old boy. Tamir was shot in the abdomen by an officer responding to a call about someone with a firearm near a recreation center. After the confrontation was captured on surveillance video, it became clear Tamir had been carrying what turned out to be an airsoft-type gun that shoots non-lethal plastic pellets. The federal lawsuit alleges excessive force, negligence, infliction of emotional distress on his sister and mother, violation of due process for the parents, and failure by the responding officers to immediately provide first aid to the boy, who died the next day. It also claims false imprisonment of Tamir's sister Tajai, 14, who was tackled by an officer as she ran towards his body screaming 'my baby brother, they killed my baby brother.' The officers then handcuffed the young girl and threw her in the back of a squad car. Mourning: Tamir's mother Samaria Rice, center, speaks about the investigation into the death of her son . At no point was Tamir given medical attention until an FBI agent on a nearby bank detail arrived, almost five minutes after the shooting. The entire incident, from the moment police arrive on the scene to when Tajai is taken down and handcuffed to the arrival of the agent who provided first aid, was caught on video which the city was initially reluctant to release it to the public. The city said in response to the federal lawsuit that it didn't violate Tamir's federal rights and that it is entitled to certain legal immunities. One of the family's attorneys, Walter Madison, told the Northeast Ohio Media Group that the complaint has merit. 'I do believe that a 12-year-old child died unnecessarily at the hands of Cleveland police officers and I do believe that certain officers shouldn't have been entitled to wear the uniform,' he said. The Cuyahoga County sheriff's department is investigating the shooting. A prosecutor has promised that a grand jury will consider whether the case merits criminal charges.","Police shot Tamir dead in Cleveland, Ohio, as he brandished a pellet gun .

"TV and radio presenter Zoe Ball says becoming a mother has been the making of her . Her party lifestyle in the Nineties earned her a reputation as a ladette. But Zoe Ball says becoming a mother has been the making of her. The 44-year-old BBC TV and radio presenter also revealed that she uses her children as an excuse to have a quiet night at home. She said: ‘My kids are the best things that have ever happened to me. They are amazing.’ The former raver married Norman Cook, 51 – better known as DJ Fatboy Slim – in 1999 and they have a son Woody, 14, and daughter Nelly, five. At the height of her partying days while fronting the Radio 1 Breakfast Show, Miss Ball admitted she was once so ‘high’ while presenting live from hedonistic party island Ibiza she could barely speak. Miss Ball, who was once happy to swig from a bottle of Jack Daniels, has been teetotal for the last six years but recently admitted she is now enjoying the occasional drink. Speaking at an awards ceremony on Sunday which saw Esther Rantzen crowned Tesco celebrity mother of the year, she said the children were her top priority. Miss Ball, who recently presented Strictly Come Dancing, said: ‘The great thing about being a mum is that it gives you something else to think about other than yourself. 'I just think it’s the best job in the world. ‘In the beginning it’s like, “What do you mean I’m never going to go out any more?” but now it’s such a joy. It’s such a great excuse to be like, “No, I’m with the kids,” so you don’t have to go out any more.’ But motherhood did not come easily. She said: ‘It was tricky at first. You’re like “What? You scream all night? I don’t know what to do"". 'But you learn about yourself, you grow and you also start to understand your own parents. Her party lifestyle in the Nineties earned her a reputation as a ladette (left).

She also revealed Cook has turned out to be ‘the best dad’. ‘I have to say he is amazing,’ she said. ‘Who would have thought that this crazy rave DJ would make such an amazing father but he has. We all grow up and we can’t play forever. We have to get sensible.’","44-year-old revealed she uses her children as an excuse to have a night in .

"His best-known characters characters are famous for their clothes. But the Cat in the Hat and the Fox in Socks have previous little in common with the stars another Dr Seuss tale. Indeed, the gang of naked sisters who star in The Seven Lady Godivas: The True Facts Concerning History’s Barest Family, are famous for wearing no clothes at all. Not the usual: Dr Seuss penned this saucy book in 1939 - but it never gained much popularity despite featuring pages of cartoon nudity . The famed author, whose birthday yesterday is now celebrated as a national reading festival, wrote and illustrated the failed exhibitionist tome in 1939. But despite his efforts to 'draw the sexiest babes I could', it only sold 2,500 copies, and went out of print. As a recent feature in Mashable details, the book retells the English legend of Lady Godiva - who rode naked through the streets of Coventry to protest her husband's unfair tax hikes. However, Seuss altered the story by multiplying the number of nudes by seven - and making sure they stayed that way at all times, rather than just to prove a point. In a foreword to the out-of-print tale, he wrote that he was correcting an inaccuracy in inserting six more naked women into the story - and that their nudity was a source of 'pride'. Not quite: Dr Seuss is much better-known for other creations, such as the Cat in the Hat . Change of heart: Seuss, also known as Theodor Geisel, decided to stick to children's books after The Seven Lady Godivas . Seuss, real name Theodor Geisel, wrote that he was in fact telling 'a beautiful story of love, honor and scientific achievement'. Publishing the book was allegedly a condition for Random House, Seuss's new publisher, when he jumped ship to them. However, it seems few agreed with his own high opinion of the bawdy tale. While 10,000 copies were printed, only 2,500 were ever bought. He later accepted that the book was no good. According to The Atlantic, he said: 'I attempted to draw the sexiest babes I could, but they came out looking absurd. After the experience he turned his back on the adult audience. His New York Times obituary records him once saying: 'I'd rather write for kids. They're more appreciative; adults are obsolete children, and the hell with them.' Before Dr Seuss decided that she should have six naked cartoon sisters, Lady Godiva was a well-known figure in English legend, whose story introduced Peeping Tom into the world. Godiva was a real historical figure who lived in the 11th-century city of Coventry, and was married to Earl Leofric of Mercia. According to folklore, she rode naked through the streets to free her people from her husband's oppressive tax regime. Original: Lady Godiva was the legendary wife of an English earl, who rode naked through the streets of Coventry as a protest against an unfair tax on his people. She is pictured above in an 1898 oil painting by John Collier . Godiva had begged her husband to lift the onerous taxes time and again - but failed to persuade him. Eventually, he said he would only relent if she completed the implausible task of riding naked through the streets - which she agreed to. To preserve her modesty, she asked all the citizens of the town to clear the streets, shutter their windows and look away. According to the story, everybody complied except a tailor called Tom. But after stealing a glance, he was struck instantly blind. He, and people like him, were known forever afterwards as a Peeping Tom.","Seuss penned The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939 - but it was a flop .

"Even the most security conscious can be put off by complicated installations and hefty price tags. But Panasonic is hoping to make protecting your home and family a lot easier, and more mobile. The manufacturer has announced the world’s first 4G surveillance camera called Nubo that detects and alerts homeowners to intruders and can be fitted inside and out the house. Home security: Built-in sensors detect human shapes and the camera will start recording automatically if a person is spotted. A message will then be sent via mobile (screenshot pictured) to alert a homeowner . Nubo was unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Built-in sensors detect human shapes and will start recording automatically if a person is spotted. The clips are uploaded to a free cloud service, and footage is taken at 720p with 10 frames per second to limit how much data the camera uses. When connected to a Wi-Fi network this increases to 30fps at 1080p. In addition to 4G, the Nubo works on 2G and 3G connections and because it is IP-66 weather resistant it can, in theory, be mounted anywhere with a mobile data signal. Mobile support including GPRS, 2G, 3G and 4G: Nubo will offer connectivity with leading wireless carriers, with the Vodafone being the first partner to launch with in Europe Outdoor ready . (IP-66): Nubo is IP-66 rated weather resistant and can be used indoors and outdoors . Smart human detection: Nubo’s advanced video analytics identify when a person walks in front of the camera and sends an alert to a mobile app . Links with smart home devices: Nubo’s wireless radio technology means it can communicate with external sensors, such as door or motion sensors. Battery power: Nubo can be connected to an external battery, allowing for temporary use in places without a power connection . Security: Videos, audio and images are automatically transferred to a cloud-based storage system, protected by bank-level SSL security and encrypted passwords . ‘In the past, consumers had to choose between a fixed Wi-Fi home monitoring product, a fixed professional surveillance or a mobile video recording product,’ a Panasonic spokesman told MailOnline. ‘To solve this problem, Panasonic Cameramanager is launching Nubo, a new standalone camera that allows users to have all the benefits of a mobile security camera, with the advantage of 4G connectivity.’ ‘Consumers have long had to compromise on mobility and connectivity when it came to their surveillance needs, bound either by location or connectivity,’ added Tijmen Vos, CTO of Panasonic Cameramanager. ‘Our vision is to deliver a product that allows users the freedom and flexibility of choosing where the camera can be used and the confidence in knowing that the data created is securely transmitted and stored. ‘With the introduction of Nubo, we’re putting the control of safety and surveillance into the user’s hands.’ When a recording begins, the owner is sent an alert via a smartphone app and can then use the Nubo’s two-way communication tool to talk to the person being filmed. Secret eye: The clips are uploaded to a free cloud service, and footage is taken at 720p with 10 frames per second to limit how much data the camera uses (camera pictured) Elsewhere, the camera has an infrared detectors and works in low lighting. During its press conference, Panasonic also announced it is launching its own mobile network using Vodafone’s infrastructure - making it a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) - and service plans for the Nubo on this network will start at £5 ($7) a month. This includes cloud storage, but a microSD card slot will store footage if the mobile data fails. This means it can be used without a service plan, too. The cheapest plan will include 250 alarms per month and seven days of cloud storage for video clips. Additional plans will be available up to in a £33 ($50) a month for 2,500 alarms and 90 days of cloud storage. Once the data runs out alarms will still be sent but users will need to buy more to view the clips. Nubo's app will work with Android and iOS and users will be able to watch footage live, control how long Nubo records for and see a history log of activity. Nubo ships in November but can be pre-ordered in the UK and Netherlands from April. Panasonic said it plans to launch the camera in the US and other regions by March next year.","Nubo was unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .

"It looks like something from outer space, but the 'alien of the deep' is found much closer to home. With its fleshy snout, nail-like teeth and flabby pink body it wouldn't look out of place in a science fiction film, but the rare sea goblin shark described as an 'alien of the deep' has been found off Australia's southeast coast and delivered to the Australian Museum in Sydney. The prehistoric-looking goblin sharks live on deep sea bottoms and little is known about their lives. The shark had died by the time it was handed over, but it was still a priceless asset as only four of them have been acquired by the Sydney museum - the first two collected back in the 1980s. A goblin shark with a long flattened snout covered with pores is shown at the Australian Museum . 'It's pretty impressive, it's not hideous it's beautiful,' said the Australian Museum's fish collection manager Mark McGrouther, who described its teeth as looking like 'little daggers'. 'They are not caught terribly often. They are not encountered terribly often at all.' The latest was picked up by a fisherman in January. It was found near Eden, off Australia's southeast coast, at a depth of about 200 metres and delivered in excellent condition to the museum. The Australian Museum's fish collection manager Mark McGrouther shows the jaws of a Goblin Shark in the sorting lab in Sydney . McGrouther said he was 'thrilled' to handle the shark, which is found in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. The species, whose scientific name is 'Mitsukurina owstoni', is thought to be a living fossil dating back some 125 million years. The animal's jaw mechanism, which shoots forward when it detects prey and then retracts under its fleshy, spade-shaped snout, was what fascinated McGrouther the most. Its fleshy snout, nail-like teeth and flabby pink body makes it stand out from the crowd . 'I suspect because it has got soft, flabby musculature, it doesn't need much energy... so it will swim slowly over the bottom just using its snout like a metal detector,' he said. 'It will be sweeping over the bottom and when it detects a small fish, or a crab or a squid it will shoot those jaws out 'wham' and capture whatever it is. 'It will spear it with those sharp pointed teeth and then just wolf it down whole.'
