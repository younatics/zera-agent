"For many people, being happy at work is an important pursuit and something which drives employees in- and out- of certain workplaces. Australian entrepreneur, motivational speakers, and founder of RedBalloon Naomi Simson learnt this the hard way, after the company recorded a 60% turnover rate in a single year. 'People were unhappy. They were lost and confused. When we recorded a 60% turnover rate that was the moment I realised that I could have all the vision in the world, but if I wasn't bringing people along with me, it meant nothing,' Naomi told Daily Mail Australia. Naomi Simon is an Australian entrepreneur, motivational speakers, and founder of RedBalloon . Naomi started RedBalloon in 2001, running the company from her home and gradually building it up into the iconic business it is today, providing customers with 'experience gifts' that range from workshops to skydiving. 'At the time we expanded, I needed really amazing people around me. But if there's no job description then people aren't going to be sure of what they are doing,' she said. 'Leadership is about taking responsibility. My personal motto is that if it is up to me, I'm accountable.' 'So I realised that I needed to make some fundamental changes so that people who came to work with us knew they were doing something of value.' The impact the changes made became evident in the growth of the company, which has sold more than two and a half million experiences and was voted one of BRW's Best Places to Work  for five consecutive years. Naomi has also consistently been recognised by the business community for her approach, winning awards including the 2005 Westpac NSW Entrepreneur of the Year and the National Telstra Business Women's Award for Innovation in 2008.

'When you are effectively competing with other businesses you need to identify why people would want to work for you,' Naomi said. 'People want to work for a business that has a clear sense of purpose. People want to have fun and believe in the work they are doing,' she said. Naomi, who now also runs an award-winning blog, and has close to 800,000 followers as a LinkedIn Influencer, said that the key to her business model is recognition and trust. 'It was about introducing a philosophy of recognition, both peer to peer and within teams, so that employees can thank people in other parts of the business,' she said. The approach was so successful when it was adopted at RedBalloon that the company decided to launch a platform for other businesses to do the same. 'We wanted to share what we learnt because we want other people to have great workplaces too,' Naomi said. The technology, called Redii, is designed to enable employees and employers to communicate their appreciation to one another. 'I want people to be proud of where they work and want to tell everyone.' Naomi, who has also added public speaker to her CV, has written Live What You Love, a book designed to help readers identify their passion and pursue it. Naomi (above, with her daughter) believes that more time with friends and family is about being deliberate outside of work to really be present with loved ones, and not to be checking work emails or answering calls . 'When you're with your family don't sit on a tablet or device,' Naomi said (above with her children) Naomi runs an award-winning blog, and has close to 800,000 followers as a LinkedIn Influencer . As part of this, the entrepreneur has identified four key factors that employees desire for a 'good day' at work, based on a survey of more than 3000 Australians and New Zealanders. More praise, better managers, more time with friends and family, and greater trust are all crucial to running a business in which workers are happy and feel as though they are valued. 'In terms of praise, it's not about an entitlement culture. It's about encouraging people to do more praising because when you give you feel great,' Naomi said, . 'Managers are there to nurture the uniqueness of individuals, which is different to leadership. It's about amplifying the greatness of people in their roles,' she said.

She is also passionate about trusting people to do their jobs, and enabling them to do their roles well. 'If you are going to employ adults then they are clearly not children. People should be trusted at work and encouraged to do their best work,' Naomi said, . 'Don't do other people's jobs for them. If I even consider doing someone else's task then I have just immediately diminished my colleague and have shown them I don't trust them,' she said. Naomi said that identifying how to live with passion and purpose, which she believes are key to living a successful and happy life, make all the difference at work and at home.

"As George Osborne delivered his ‘giveaway’ budget today, it wasn't just his generous economic measures that got people talking. The Chancellor of the Exchequer appeared to be in the final stages of an image overhaul, adding the finishing touches to his new slimline figure and modern haircut with a trendy suit. And as he stepped out of Number 11 Downing Street this morning, he was snapped with what appeared to be a face of makeup. Scroll down for video . Mr Osborne's suit divided opinion on Twitter today for being ill-fitting . Mr Osborne’s new look is a far cry from his appearance when he first took up the government post in 2010, when he was significantly heavier, with a middle-aged haircut and a frumpy style. However, thanks to a lifestyle makeover – which included lots of jogging and fasting twice a week on the 5:2 diet – the Chancellor today cut a trimmer figure. The 43-year-old's new haircut was also compared to Hollywood movie star Antonio Banderas’s in his early days, with a miniature wispy fringe edged over his forehead. But it was Mr Osborne's new suit that really drew reaction, with comments flooding on social media. Mr Osborne's new look echoed that of Hollywood actor Antonio Banderas . Mr Osborne was wearing a thick layer of make-up to present the budget . Critics called the ensemble a strange cut – and said it appeared too large around the shoulders and too short in the length of the trousers. It also featured large stitching around the lapels that gave it a childlike quality. But it was the decision to go for the old-fashioned, three-button suit that really got people talking on Twitter. Jack Harvard Taylor posted: 'Not a fan of George Osborne's suit - strange cut.' While Jon Pace tweeted: 'My old boss was on Jury Service and was convinced a man was guilty on the basis he was wearing a suit like George Osbourne's!' And Kenny Farquharson added: 'Osborne controversially going for three-button suit, against gentlemen's outfitters orthodoxy.' Twitter was awash with comments about George Osborne's suit today . MailOnline fashion expert Simon Glazin said: 'He may be delivering the budget, but I didn't realise George Osbourne was shopping on a budget. 'This suit screams cheap to me. You can tell by the strange stitching and the high-cut, sloppy lapels. Also a big give away is the wrinkling material. 'It definitely looks budget to me. And a three-button jacket is a very old school, strange choice. 'Maybe his expensive suits were all at the dry cleaners. 'Bad timing, and bad choice, for one of his biggest and most-covered speeches in the Commons.' Mr Osborne supporting a fuller face in 2001, left, and last year, cutting a trimmer figure . Mr Osborne in 2012, when he was considerably heavier and less style-conscious . Fortunately for Mr Osborne, the suit took the attention away from the fact that his face was seemingly covered in a thick layer of foundation. Despite a few setbacks, the Chancellor's style transformation has been a vast improvement on his original look of five years ago. The style overhaul has been thanks to one of his senior government aides, Thea Rogers, who used to work as a producer for BBC political editor Nick Robinson before Mr Osborne hired her to manage his image. As well as his new look, she has also been responsible for the increase in appearances at places like building sites to make him appear more down to earth. Thanks to a healthier lifestyle - and the 5:2 diet, which involves fasting for two days of the year, George Osborne has lost weight as part of his style makeover - pictured, left, in 2014, and, right, today . Mr Osbourne has made appearances at places like building sites to make him appear more down to earth . Ms Rogers was responsible for his new haircut and also for putting him on the 5:2 diet, which saw him slim down dramatically over the course of a year. The diet requires Mr Osborne to limit his intake to 600 calories two days a week and eat normally on the other five. It has been reported that the new look has been tailored to give him the best possible chance of  succeeding David Cameron as Prime Minister when the time comes. HOW GEORGE OSBORNE'S STYLE HAS CHANGED SINCE HE FIRST DELIVERED THE BUDGET IN 2010...

"Leading author and expert Professor Brendan Gleeson has developed predictions of what Australian cities will look like in the future, and his findings will come as a shock to many. It gives an insight into what Australia will look like 30 years' time. The cities will be much more like Hong Kong and Dubai in terms of cityscape with increased futuristic architectural design. Food and shade producing trees will adorn all streets giving a much stronger green canopy less hard surface feel to the cities, while cars will be few in number, small, driverless and lightweight. Scroll down for video . Sydney in 2043 is predicted to see the Harbour Bridge covered in solar absorbing material . There’ll be no personal flying cars however, but lots of drone like machines of many shapes and sizes including some carrying small numbers of human occupants. ‘I anticipate the effects of climate change could have a huge impact,’ Professor Gleeson of Melbourne University says. ‘As key global resources run out, we will have to adapt how we live and our cities will change to reflect that. Mass migration will also drive big changes as parts of the planet become much less inhabitable.' In Melbourne the vision is that it will have a great towerscape/city skyline . In Sydney the Harbour Bridge will be white-grey, covered in solar absorbing material and will also have large open scoops over its main arches that collect massive amounts of rainwater. There will be greenery on skylines that will have energy efficient vertical gardens, and increased use of ‘aquaculture’. More ‘towerscapes’ will be on the skyline (Parramatta, Penrith, Liverpool). Melbourne is predicted to have a great towerscape/city skyline, with the MCG covered for heat protection and water catchment. Aquaculture and solar arrays will be across Port Phillip Bay. In Brisbane road tunnels will appear to become safe havens through extreme weather conditions – due to global warming, and energy use transport will flock Brisbane’s river crisscrossed with dozens of foot/cycle bridges. Brisbane will see its river crisscrossed with dozens of foot/cycle bridges . Inner city parks will be transformed for agriculture and water catchment in Adelaide . Adelaide will have a new ultra-Mediterranean climate. Inner city parks will be transformed for agriculture and water catchment. Depopulation due to climate change and a collapse in water catchment is predicted in Perth. It’ll be a poorer, less well maintained city overall. ‘Australia’s cities will have grown in size and complexity but the major change will flow from a hotter, wilder climate and great stresses on basic resources, especially water and energy,' Professor Gleeson says. Depopulation due to climate change and a collapse in water catchment is predicted in Perth . ‘On the positive side, great transitions to clean energy will have been made, and all parts of the urban fabric put to work harvesting energy and water. The urban tree canopy will have grown to give a much more forested feel to the cities.’ The findings have been used in Syfy’s 12 Monkeys TV series, which is inspired by the hit 1995 film set in 2043. It starts on Thursday night.","Increased futuristic architectural design will typify Australian cities .

"A black member of the University of Oklahoma fraternity plunged into scandal after film emerged of them has hit out at his so-called 'brothers'. William Bruce James II, who is one of just two black men ever to join the university's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, pledged in 2001 - but has now turned his back on the organization. The footage showed SAE members, riding a bus while wearing bow ties and dress shirts, chanting 'There will never be a n***** SAE' to the tune of If You're Happy And You Know It. Scroll down for videos . Renouncing: William Bruce James II was an SAE pledge in 2001 - but now says he wishes he never joined the frat in the wake of a video showing current members singing a racist chant . Cut it off! As one frat brother gleefully sings a racist chant, another steps in and tries to cut off recording of the shameful incident . It concluded: 'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** SAE'. Outraged leaders of SAE's national organization shut down the fraternity Sunday night, and today the University of Oklahoma ordered the members to leave campus. In the wake of the sickening footage, James published an uncompromising letter on his blog, in which he described how hearing the chant 'hit me in the core of my soul'. James said that while he was at SAE he never felt as if racism was endemic, but says that in light of the current members' behavior, he wishes he had never joined. James published the letter on his blog, under the title There Will Never Be Another BLACK SAE, and also spoke to local news station KFOR about his renunciation of SAE. He said: 'My former fraternity broke my heart today... to say it was racist is not enough. It hit me in the very core of my soul when I saw the video. 'I know those bus rides well. I was a member of this chapter 14 years ago. The second BLACK MAN to be initiated in those halls. We had our own songs….different songs…but songs we sang on every bus trip to every date party for four years. '...So now 14 years later, my ""brothers"" now sing this song. This is what gets their spirits united for a great night out with their friends and their dates (one of which, thank God exposed this …this). 'This is what binds them. But I remember what binded us. I remember the True Gentleman.' Parents came out in to help their college children move out of the fraternity house on Monday . Coming down: University workers on Monday tore down the Greek letters for SAE on the fraternity house - after officials cut all ties to the fraternity . The True Gentleman is the Sigma Alpha Epsilon creed, which extols virtues such as self-control and humility, which members are supposed to strive to live up to. He continues: 'I thought we were different. Maybe we weren’t. Maybe I was just being hopeful. But I believed. I believed in SAE. I believed in the True Gentlemen. 'I believed my brothers were my brothers. I believed my son should be their brother if he so chose one day. But then I saw that video. I saw that video speaking of lynching me instead of ever letting me sign.' Fury: Hundreds of students rallied on the campus in Norman, Oklahoma, on Monday morning to protest the horrific chant by the fraternity members . James concludes: 'I can have no association with this organization as a black man. I know these were “kids being kids” and maybe they aren’t the hateful ignorant lost little boys I think they are, but I will not stand behind anything that allowed this to happen. 'They are not just kids being kids. Those boys are sons. Sons of men who failed them, and they failed my son. You Failed ME! Member 261-057. 'Your boys sang in unison. They may not know where the song came from or who made it up or even what all the words really mean, but they sing it so often they know all the words whether they want to or not.' It came as SAE members fled the University of Oklahoma campus, on the orders of the university's president. David Boren today threatened legal action against those responsible, and said he wanted them to go straight away. He said: 'We will look at all possible punishment and what is available to us under the law. Under the civil rights law it may be possible for us to take action against certain individuals,' he said. 'Would I be happy if they left voluntarily? Yes. We don't have room for racists and bigots here.' He added: 'I don't want them here. I'll pay the bus fare to get them out. They're not coming back.'","William Bruce James II pledged to Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter in 2001 .

"A heroin dealer and a fellow inmate imprisoned for stabbing a taxi driver in the back in an unprovoked attack were let out of jail for three hours to watch Fifty Shades of Grey, it has been reported. Roseanne McCreadie, 34, who is serving nine years for helping her gangster father smuggle heroin into Scotland, was allowed to go and watch the sexually explicit film along with fellow criminal Kim Gray, 47. Gray, who is less than a year into a 40-month sentence for her near-fatal assault, and McCreadie were taken to the Vue Cinema in Stirling, Scotland, by former inmate Louise McLachlan. Roseanne McCreadie, 34,  serving nine years for heroin smuggling, and Kim Gray, 47,  jailed for 40 months for stabbing a taxi driver, were given three hour's leave to go to Vue Cinema in Stirling (pictured) The pair were joined by Louise McLachlan, another former prisoner who had recently been released, who boasted that she had booked them VIP seats for the film (file image) The trio met while they were incarcerated at Cornton Vale prison, also in Stirling. McLachlan even used Facebook to boast about the trip. According to the Scottish Daily Record, she wrote: 'Right my ladies just booked the tickets for 50shades (sic) on Sunday at 12 at the vue. 'VIP seats of course, use [you] sort it out with CV & i’ll pick use up at 12 it finishes at 2.25 so use will make the 3hours no bother.' McCreadie replied: 'Brilliant lou look 4ward to that babe.' The drug runner was only just back from a week of release  when she was given a three-hour extension to go and watch the film, according toThe Sun. Speaking to the paper, Conservative MSP Margaret Mitchell said: 'These were serious crimes. To get let out to go to the flicks is unacceptable.' McCreadie was jailed as part of a gang of 13 who were given a total of 152 years in 2012 when police busted a heroin smuggling ring that stretched from Liverpool to Scotland. It is believed that McCreadie had just returned from a week's leave from Cornton Vale prison, Stirling, but was granted an extra three hours to go and watch the film . She was initially sentenced to nine years for her part in the criminal enterprise, but the judge added another 28 days for contempt of court after she yelled 'ya bunch of c****' at the jury. She was jailed alongside her father Eddie, then 54, who was given 12 years and eight months. Meanwhile Gray was given 40 months after stabbing 60-year-old cab driver Joe Cameron, causing him to suffer a near-fatal heart attack. Mr Cameron was called to a fare in Dunfermline in February last year, and when he walked up to the customer's door to collect them, he was attacked from behind by Gray. Police later told him she stabbed him with a kitchen knife up to the hilt in a motiveless attack. A Scottish Prison Service spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We wouldn't comment on individual prisoners.'","Roseanne McCreadie, 34, went to cinema with fellow inmate Kim Gray, 47 .

"A great-grandfather left with a gaping hole in his face due to cancer treatment has been given the devastating news his condition is terminal. Raymond Martin, 64, has facial angiosarcoma, a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels. He has already undergone a series of operations, the first of which took surgeons 12 hours to remove a tumour from his face. But the cancer returned and he required more treatment, as well as procedures to remodel his nose and face. A few months ago he developed a huge wound under his right eye, and doctors planned surgery to remove another tumour. Raymond Martin, 64, has been told the cancer that has destroyed his face is incurable and there is nothing more doctors can do. He is pictured before being diagnosed (left) and afterwards (right) Mr Martin developed a spot on his face in 2012, which began to spread. He was diagnosed with facial angiosarcoma, a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels in 2013 . The cancer returned and Mr Martin developed a gaping hole under his right eye. He is pictured with his family (from left to right), grandson Dean Martin, 17, wife Alice, 63 and daughter Julie Martin . But surgeons discovered the cancer had spread to such an extent that  there is nothing more that can be done. All they can do is help change his bandages and keep him as comfortable as possible. Now, Mr Martin and his family are speaking out to raise awareness of angiosarcoma, in the hope his story can help others. Mr Martin's daughter Nicola Borthwick, 42, said: 'They've told us nothing more can be done now. 'We only hope that Marty's story raises awareness and prevents anyone else undergoing what he has had to suffer.' Mr Martin is now housebound at his home in Scotswood, Newcastle, where he is cared for by wife Alice, 63. His problems began when he noticed a spot on his cheek in 2012, but thought nothing about it. 'It all started with just a spot and it was nothing special so I didn't worry about it,' Mr Martin said. 'But the spot started to spread so I went to see a GP and it was first thought that it could be a rash or infection and I was given a course of antibiotics.' However, the antibiotics did not work and because his face got worse, he was sent to hospital for tests. Angiosarcoma is a relatively rare soft tissue tumour. It usually occurs in the head, neck, and especially in the scalp of elderly people. Its presentation varies from a small plaque to multifocal nodules. The treatment depends on the extent of the disease, but most cases are treated with wide excision - a surgical procedure to remove a small area of diseased or problematic tissue with a margin of normal tissue - and reconstruction. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are advocated in recurrent or extensive abnormalities in tissue. SOURCE: National Centre for Biotechnology Information . 'Never in a hundred years, could I have imagined that I would be told I had cancer,' Mr Martin said. Medics at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary took a skin biopsy from Mr Martin and experts identified that he had a rare form of cancer that was affecting a large part of his face. There was no other option than to perform a 12-hour-long life-saving surgery to remove the tumour. This involved taking skin from Mr Martin's thigh, grafted onto his face. The operation completely changed his appearance. 'I knew that the operation had to be done, so I just had to get on with it,' he said. 'When I was going home from hospital I thought 'I don't want to look in the mirror'. It was a few weeks before I had a proper look at myself and I did get frightened as it looked like I had a bandage on my face.' Following the operation, doctors were optimistic that they had removed the whole tumour and Mr Martin underwent an intensive course of chemotherapy in the hope of killing any remaining cancer cells. But, just six months later, the facial angiosarcoma returned and once again he required further treatment at the region's Northern Centre for Cancer Care. In 2014 Mr Martin underwent a 12-hour operation where surgeons removed a cancerous tumour and took skin from his thigh to graft on to his face . Mr Martin is now cared for at his home by his wife Alice, 63. He hopes that through telling his story he will raise awareness to this rare form of cancer . After a series of operations to remodel his face and nose, Mr Martin believed his life was back on track and he could accept his new appearance. But in recent months a wide and painful hole began to develop under his right eye, as the cancer had once again returned. After initially preparing for surgery to remove another tumour, Mr Martin was dealt the devastating blow that the cancer had spread too rapidly for treatment to be successful. The wound has grown and deteriorated rapidly over recent weeks Mr Martin's eyes bleed constantly, and he has to have his bandages changed regularly. His family have rallied around him to support him, and he now hopes, through telling his story, that others will become more aware of angiosarcoma and its devastating effects.","Raymond Martin, 64, has a rare form of cancer called facial angiosarcoma .

"Americans are usually renowned for exaggerating how big things are in their country, but there’s no need for this in Australia – not when you’ve got earthworms the size of snakes. This is what the Simoneau family found out when they spotted two giant earthworms near their Buderim home on the Sunshine Coast. ‘At first glance we thought they were snakes. It was just this dark long object on a pale tile,’ Tamara Simoneau told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Seven-year-old Scarlett Simoneau holds up the giant earthworm that was found at her house in Buderim . ‘It was a scare because at first they looked like snakes. But after a closer look the snakes turned out to be giant earthworms. The two worms measured between 60cm and a metre long.’ The heavy rain that hit Queensland when Cyclone Marsha passed by was what brought the giant earthworms to the surface. Earthworms are uncomfortable when the ground is very saturated and they were probably looking for higher ground during bad weather. It's this big: Scarlett lays the giant earthworm on the floor to show how long it is . ‘They were massive. The ones I’m used to seeing are more like spaghetti. There was one in the garage that was crawling slowly along the concrete, while the other one appeared a few days later on a mat on our patio,’ Tamara said. Tamara had lived in Canada for eight years, so she when she put pictures of the giant earthworms on Facebook her Canadian friends could not believe it. ‘The best comment was: ‘In Canada we call that a snake.’ They were all pretty shocked. A few others said they were going to come and visit me after seeing this,’ she said. Scarlett was fascinated by the huge earthworm and couldn't wait to pick it up . ‘But even my Australian friends were pretty surprised at the size of them.’ Tamara’s seven-year-old daughter Scarlett was fascinated by the worms, and couldn’t wait to pick them up and inspect them. ‘She put on a gardening glove and picked it up. She was very gentle when she picked it up. Then it expanded and got even longer. We put it in the garden and watched it make its way slowly back underground,’ she said.

"Beijing's Forbidden City is following in the footsteps of Rome's Colosseum and London's National Gallery and banning the selfie stick. Bosses at the Palace Museum in the city have begun a crackdown on the popular phone accessories over fears that one wrong move could cause lasting damage to the invaluable artifacts in the ancient palace houses. The People's Daily Online reports that eagle-eyed staff are keeping watch over photo-enthusiasts in the palace's narrow or crowded areas, as well as all the indoor exhibitions, to avoid any potentially costly accidents. Ban: The Forbidden City has said selfie sticks are no longer allowed inside the exhibition rooms or narrow passageways over concerns an unfortunate accident may occur . 'Selfie sticks will cause safety concerns, whether for tourists or the exhibits,' Shen Lixia, deputy director of the museum's tourist reception department, told China Daily. 'It may touch the glass exhibition case and cause damage to the cultural relics.' She added that as well as being banned in exhibition areas, the sticks would be banned in outdoor areas of the museum - so visitors would be wise not to bother taking them at all. However, the sticks will still be allowed outside the palace in the Forbidden City - so tourists can still get the all-important shot of the famous 15th century building in the background. There was speculation that the move could be the first step to a total ban, as has been implemented at other cultural attractions around the world. It is thought the Louvre in Paris will bring in a ban in the next few weeks, while several football stadiums have banned them over fears the extendable devices could be used as a weapon. But it seems should the Forbidden City instill a total ban in mobile-mad China - there are said to be 19,300 versions of the selfie stick available on the country's answer to eBay, Taobao - they would have a fair amount of support. Popular: Chinese tourists use 'selfie sticks' to take pictures as they stand on Jingshan Park, overlooking the Forbidden City, in February. There are more than 19,000 versions of the sticks for sale on Taobao . 'Museum photos are good for spreading the cultural messages, but we should pay attention to our ways,' Cao Wei, a celebrated Sina Weibo blogger, told People's Daily. 'I support the museums' actions on the selfie stick ban.'","Museum bosses have banned stick in exhibition rooms and narrow areas .

"Monica Lewinsky has claimed she was the world's first cyberbullying victim after she was 'humiliated worldwide' because of her affair with Bill Clinton. She is pictured above at the Forbes Under 30 Summit last year . Monica Lewinsky has told a Norwegian conference that she became the world's first cyberbullying victim after her affair with Bill Clinton was exposed. The 41-year-old said she believes the rising popularity of Google in the same year that the affair came to light led to her life being destroyed by online trolls in a way others had not experienced. She told a crowd at the Marie Høeg Conference that she went from being an anonymous person to being 'humiliated worldwide' in just 24 hours. 'What happened to me was that I lost my entire reputation,' she told The Local. 'I lost myself and the whole world was given a picture of me that I did not recognise at all. 'There is immeasurable humiliation. It is the feeling that the whole world is laughing at you. I just thought I would die.' Ms Lewinsky's comments were made a week before she is due to give a TED talk on cyberbullying. The former White House intern shot to fame when her affair with Clinton was uncovered in 1998. Clinton, then 49, initially denied their relationship but Ms Lewinsky, then 22, confirmed it had been sexual. While Clinton, who was president from 1993 to 2001, was fined for giving a false testimony Ms Lewinsky became a household name – and the butt of countless late-night jokes. A decade later she penned an explosive tell-all article for Vanity Fair about the Clinton scandal, describing her relationship with the married president as 'consensual'. She also spoke at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in October last year where she told the crowd: 'Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college I fell in love with my boss. Ms Lewinsky was just 22 when she and then-President Bill Clinton began an affair that would deeply affect both of their futures. Picture taken in November 1995 . A picture on a signed card to Ms Lewinsky shows Clinton posing with her in the Oval Office of the White House in 1997 . 'I [then] lost my public self, or had it stolen. Of course, it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up. Yet around the world this story went. 'It was a viral phenomenon that, you could argue, was the first moment of truly ""social media.""' Ms Lewinsky said she was inspired to speak out after a gay student at Rutgers University committed suicide days after his roommate secretly filmed him kissing another man. She is hoping that publicizing her story will lead to people thinking twice about humiliating and trolling others online. Clinton famously said he 'did not have sexual relations' with Ms Lewinsky when she claimed they had had relations nine times between 1995 and 1997. Above, the pair are pictured greeting each other at a White House lawn party in November 1996 .","41-year-old told conference in Norway that she was 'humiliated worldwide'

"Bizarre footage has emerged of Sean Price, who is accused of murdering a 17-year-old school girl, delivering online rants posted two weeks before he was arrested. Price is charged with killing Masa Vukotic who was stabbed to death just 500 metres from her home on Tuesday. He attended a police station hours after they released CCTV footage of a man in a red T-shirt holding a plastic bag getting on a bus near the Doncaster park - in Melbourne's east - where Masa was found. Scroll down for video . Murder accused Sean Price has appeared in a video posted online where he talks about his ears getting 'raped' Price is charged with killing Masa Vukotic, 17, who was stabbed to death just 500 metres from her house on Tuesday . In videos posted online, Price fronts the camera with a beanie hat tightly pulled over his ears. He talks about his ears being 'raped' and that they now 'very rarely ever go out'. He starts one of the videos - seen by Daily Mail Australia - by sharing his thoughts on criminals. 'These people who do these crimes don't think about the consequences and the aftermath,' Price said. 'It's all about having a good time, about instant gratification.' He attended a police station after footage was circulated of a man in a red T-shirt getting on a bus near the Doncaster park where Masa was murdered . The man, who was holding a white plastic bag, got on a bus on Doncaster Road at 7.09pm on Tuesday, just after Masa was murdered . Price also gives an insight into what he used to be like before his ears were 'violated'. 'I used to be pretty happy, pretty relaxed... My ears have feelings, they're real,' he said. Throughout the footage, Price does not remove his beanie and reasons: 'I'd let you see my ears but if I do I'm trusting you. Don't break my trust again.' In another video, he raps in an American accent while heavy metals plays in the background. 'Who the f*** is interested in ears... You've got a thing for bush on ears,' Price chanted. The 17-year-old (left), who was a student at Canterbury Girls' Secondary College,  was big fan of the Lolita fashion (right) trend, which is popular in Japan . Her Facebook photos show she was a well-travelled teenager who had an enthusiasm for dressing up . Price appeared at Melbourne Magistrates Court on Friday charged with murder in the stabbing of Ms Vukotic. He was also charged with six other offences - including one count of rape, two counts of robbery and three counts of common law assault including an attempted carjacking. Ms Vukotic's grief-stricken father, Slabvoljub Vukotic, locked eyes with Price during the court hearing. Mr Vukotic, wearing dark sunglasses and a black fleece, sat less than 10 metres away from Price with a police liaison officer. Masa's father, Slabvoljub Vukotic (left), faced his daughter's alleged killer when he appeared in court last week . Price wore a white T-shirt and was flanked by two security guards behind a glass screen in the dock. He looked back at the teenager's father, while also frequently closing his eyes. He also put his fingers in his mouth when he first sat down. A friend of Ms Vukotic's was heard shouting 'coward' in court when Price was eventually led from the dock by security guards. Price did not speak throughout the hearing. Friends and family have visited the scene of Masa's murder, leaving condolence messages for the teenager . The flowers and tributes started building on Wednesday and filled the entire area, just before the park . Tim Draper, Masa's boyfriend, was seen leaving a heartbreaking love note to the teenager. He was comforted by a friend as he broke down in tears . This was a stark contrast to the man who arrived on Thursday for questioning at St Kilda police station. News cameras captured Price giving the middle finger and smiling as he was flanked on either side by police officers in a blue forensic suit while he was driven into the complex. He will re-appear again in May and during a committal mention in June.

Huge towers made of wooden pallets are set alight every year to celebrate the victory of King William of Orange over Catholic King James in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. US artist Best decided to turn the tradition on its head - creating a work of art that Catholic and Protestants could work on together and burn in a symbol of peace.

Her civil suit is still pending . Still pending is Castano's civil suit against the playboy, which reads, in part: . 'Bilzerian was on an elevated dancing platform...and violently and intentionally kicked plaintiff in the face while wearing what resembled military boots.' Bilzerian told People he did no such thing. 'I don't believe in violence against women...I would never assault a woman. It got blown so far out of proportion,' he said. Bilzerian said his name was cleared after Miami Beach police did a 'full investgation.'

"Children are suffering damage to their hearts as early as 12 due to poor diets, a study has warned. Researchers found most people start life with robust heart health, but can lose it quickly through unhealthy eating habits. The American study showed few children under the age of 12 had an ideal diet and almost a third (30 per cent) were overweight or even obese. The researchers said the better equipped children are to make healthy choices, the healthier their hearts will be in adulthood. Study senior author Doctor Donald Lloyd-Jones, professor and chair of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said: ‘Our findings indicate that, in general, children start with pretty good blood pressure. Scroll down for video . Scientists said the better equipped children are to make healthy food choices, the healthier their hearts would be in adulthood. They said few children under the age of 12 taking part had an ideal diet, and almost a third were overweight or even obese (file picture posed by model) ‘But if they have a horrible diet, it will drive a worsening body mass index (BMI) and cholesterol levels. ‘The better we can equip our children to make healthy choices, the more cardiovascular health will be preserved into adulthood. ‘And those who preserve their heart health into middle age live much longer and are much healthier while they live.’ Researchers examined BMI, healthy diet, total cholesterol and blood pressure – four of the seven components of heart health – in children aged two to 11. In the sample of 8,961 children, the researchers found that all children had at least one ideal measure, but none had all four. An ideal diet score was the least prevalent health indicator, with less than one per cent of children having four or five of the five components of a healthy diet. The experts warned people are losing a lot of 'intrinsic' heart health very early in life, setting them up to be unhealthy adults . The five indicators of a healthy diet include low intake of sugar-sweetened drinks and salt, and high intake of wholegrains, fish, plus fruit and vegetables. Fewer than 10 per cent ate the recommended amounts of fruit and veg of more than 4.5 cups or more per day or fish, and wholegrains were the least frequently achieved component with just three per cent of boys and 2.4 per cent of girls hitting the target. Ninety per cent ate more salt than recommended, and more than half consumed more than the recommended number of calories from sugar-sweetened drinks. Around four out of ten of the children had ‘poor’ or ‘intermediate’ cholesterol levels, according to the findings published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. Researchers found ideal blood pressure was the most common favourable measure of cardiovascular health, ranging from 88 per cent to 93 per cent across sex and racial groups. Previous studies have shown worsening indicators of cardiovascular health, starting in adolescence and continuing through adulthood. Dr Lloyd-Jones added: ‘We really need better surveillance data, especially in children. ‘Information on physical activity, blood glucose and smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke are not available for younger children. ‘Without knowing how much physical activity a child is doing, and therefore how many calories are needed, we can’t scale the diet metrics to a child’s needs. ‘So we used the adult metrics, but understand that it would be difficult for a five-year-old to take in as many fruits and vegetables as an adult. ‘The bottom line is that we need even better data, but what we do see is that we are losing an awful lot of our intrinsic cardiovascular health very early in life, which sets us up to be unhealthy adults.’","Most people start life with robust heart health, but can lose it quickly .

"A professional dancer has refused to have plastic surgery to remove her birthmark as she has chosen to embrace her individuality. Cassandra Naud, 22, says she loves her unique appearance and even credits her birthmark for making her memorable in her industry. The dancer, from Alberta, Canada, who was once told by a casting agent to digitally erase her birthmark from her headshots, says that she believes it is a positive attribute. Scroll down for video . Cassandra refused to have her birthmark removed as she was told she would be left with severe scarring . 'My birthmark is a huge part of me,' she says. 'It makes me unique and memorable, which is especially important for the career I've chosen.' When Cassandra was born with a huge brown birthmark on her right cheek, her parents, Richard, 60, a power engineer, and France, 50, a school caretaker, were given the option to have it removed, but concerned that it would leave her face heavily scarred, they decided against it. Cassandra says she is happy with the decision that her parents made as the effects of surgery could have been extremely damaging. 'As my birthmark sunk through several layers of skin, plastic surgery was the only option for removal. Doctors gave my parents a choice, warning them there could be scarring or I could be left with a lazy eye,' she says. 'I'm so glad my parents chose to leave my birthmark as it's part of who I am. Having a birthmark distinguishes me - and I don't feel that it has ever held me back.' Cassandra Naud was born with a large birthmark under her right eye but rather than have it removed she has chosen to embrace her individuality . Cassandra works as a professional dancer and believes that her birthmark makes her more memorable . Cassandra, pictured with her mother and father, says she is thrilled that neither she or her parents went through with the removal of her birthmark . With her envious dancer body and gorgeous smile, Cassandra is used to attracting attention from strangers, but she says people are often very curious when they notice her birthmark. 'People come up to me in the street and ask me about it. I don't shy away from questions - it's natural to be curious. 'It's covered in hair which makes it difficult to disguise, but I honestly don't mind. I know some people might feel sorry for me, but I'm confident in how I look.' Cassandra hasn't always been so confident as during her school years, she was the victim of cruel taunts from bullies. She says: 'They'd taunt me saying: ""You'll get beat up in high school"" and ""The hair on your cheek is gross"". 'Their cruel remarks were hard to deal with and I'd often fight back tears. I felt ugly - even if only for that moment - and I was terrified of how I'd be treated once I got to high school.' After years of bullying, Cassandra was plagued by feelings of wanting to fit in and, aged 13, she gave her mum some shocking news. When Cassandra was born her parents were given the option of having the birthmark removed but concerned about scarring they decided against surgery. Pictured: Father Richard, mother France and brother Oliver . While she was growing up Cassandra, pictured with her mum France, suffered cruel taunts from bullies and even considered having her birthmark removed in her early teens . She says: 'I told my mum that I wanted to remove my birthmark. My parents were shocked but understanding of my decision and immediately booked an appointment with a plastic surgeon. 'He explained the scarring I'd be left with and I immediately changed my mind. I figured it wouldn't be worth it and told my mum that I'd prefer to keep my individuality. 'It was a moment of madness, but I'm so glad I made the decision to keep it.' After high school, Cassandra studied dance theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles, California, where she starred in a production of musical, Cabaret. Cassandra graduated from the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in LA last year . She has previously been told by casting directors to have it removed from headshots but she has chosen to ignore them as she thinks it helps her stand out in the industry . She graduated in July 2014 and stayed in LA where she now works as a professional dancer, recently starring in a promotion for sport's channel ESPN, which featured Maroon 5. Cassandra has also branched out into kids' entertainment having also worked on popular kid's channel, Nickelodeon. She says: 'A lot of roles require the performers to have a certain appearance. I'm never going to be hired by Disney, for example, because they want the 'perfect' look but I'm OK with that. 'I don't often face prejudice, but one agent told me to Photoshop my birthmark out of my head shots. Wanting to please, I agreed at first, despite feeling shocked they'd asked. But then I changed my mind.' Cassandra's birthmark has not prevented her from finding love with boyfriend Patrick Cook . Cassandra's birthmark has not stopped her from finding love and is currently in a relationship with boyfriend Patrick Cook, 21, after meeting eight months ago in Los Angeles. Cassandra says: 'We met at an audition for a dancing role and we've been inseparable ever since. He always tells me I'm beautiful.' Despite the unpredictable nature of the entertainment industry, Cassandra's parents have been supportive of her career. And now the dancer wants to urge other people to love themselves - exactly as they are. She says: 'People should appreciate their individuality. 'Times are changing, so don't worry about looking normal. Don't let bullies stop you and be proud of your uniqueness.'","Cassandra Naud was born with a large birthmark under her right eye .

"Girls aged five to nine are developing type-2 diabetes, figures show (file image) Girls aged five to nine are developing type-2 diabetes, figures show. There have been seven cases in England and Wales of five to nine-year-old girls with the condition, according to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health's National Paediatric and Diabetes Audit. Doctors said they have treated cases of boys aged seven, though none were recorded in the audit. There were a further 146 cases in girls aged ten to 14 and 64 cases in boys of the same age group, bringing risk of damage to eyes and kidneys, as well as heart attacks. The illness most commonly occurs in the over 40s and prior to the year 2000, no case had ever been recorded in the under 18s. But academics have recorded a sudden increase over the past two decades which is almost certainly down to obesity, our sugary diets and lack of exercise. They have also noted that the illness advances much more rapidly compared to adults and they quickly develop complications. By the time they have reached their early teens, a number have suffered damage to their eyes and kidneys and are expected to have heart attacks in their 30s. The document also warns that there are huge variations in the care offered to children and young people with diabetes – most of whom have type 1. Although the overall standards of treatment have improved, those living in the more deprived areas are less likely to have vital check ups . Just under 27,000 children, teenagers and young adults have diabetes of whom more than 97 per cent have type 1, which is believed to be genetic. Dr Justin Warner, clinical lead for the audit, said: 'On the one hand the picture is positive; the quality of care for children and young people with diabetes is improving and we're getting better at ensuring care processes are met. 'Yet the challenge we face is also growing, with more children being diagnosed with diabetes and some displaying early signs of potentially serious long term health problems. 'This is a lifelong condition where tight overall diabetes control is important to reduce the risk of complications later in life. 'This requires a close partnership between healthcare professionals delivering care and children and families with diabetes.' Last year academics revealed that they were treating children as young as seven with type 2 diabetes. Professor Tim Barrett, a consultant in paediatric diabetes at Birmingham Children's Hospital said a boy had been referred to him aged seven years 11 months, the youngest he'd seen. The illness most commonly occurs in the over 40s and prior to the year 2000, no case had ever been recorded in the under 18s.

"Danna Gomez wields a mascara wand like a pro and knows the exact method for creating the illusion of high cheekbones - but this hot new YouTube star is only five years old. And the precocious  make-up expert, from Colombia, is at the centre of a debate that such a young child should be offering beauty advice in online make-up tutorials. Not only does the little girl show how to apply eyeliner and foundation, she explains how to use contouring techniques to make noses appear slimmer. Scroll down for video . Five-year-old Danna Gomez has created a series of beauty tutorial videos, teaching her viewers how to apply make-up for special occasions including romantic Valentine's Day dinners . While some viewers have found the videos cute and rather amusing, others have criticised Danna's performance, claiming the videos are inappropriate for a girl so young . The Spanish-language videos see Danna imitating the popular beauty advice videos she's seen on the web, as she explains how to apply a range of products. With her mature delivery she has notched up millions of viewers with tutorials including how to apply special make up to celebrate a romantic occasion like Valentine's Day. But while Danna has won plenty of praise from those who found her performance cute, much criticism has come from others saying her videos are all part of the pressure for children to grow up too fast. One viewer, Miguel, said: 'Why can't we let our children be children, why do we have to rush them into being adults before they are ready?' You Know Who wrote that it was 'a perfect example of a sexualization of little innocent children'. Maki Rodriguez posted that real beauty doesn't come with paint on faces and that natural beauty is still the best. The criticism hasn't stopped Danna however, who enthusiastically explains to followers how to put on perfect and long-lasting make-up. Here wearing a dress inspired by Frozen's Princess Elsa, Danna shows viewers how to apply powder, adding that she'll also be applying it to her ears, and finishing off the look with a tiara . The response to Danna's video were reported in Zecasecas Online, which said, 'while many users find it charming, others disagree with a small girl putting on make-up and recording herself.' 'With a very natural niceness, the girl explains how to put on make up after putting on a base on the face, on the shadows, eye liner, the lip pencil and even a heart on the cheek. The article finishes: 'The post on Facebook has been shared over 150,000 times and many women say that she does her make-up better than they do, though lots of others disapprove of her putting on make-up so young."" The tutorials were filmed by the five-year-old's aunt Denisse Gomez, who thought they were so cute she posted them online, where they quickly went viral on social media. She explained in a Facebook post that for Danna the make-up videos are just 'play' and she posted them with the permission of the little girl's mother. Responding to the negative comments, Denisse said: 'Danna loves showing off and enjoys being on the camera, and as long as she's having fun and doing it on her own initiative then what is wrong with it? 'Children have always played adult games like pretending to be doctors and nurses, or mummies and daddies, or even fireman or cowboys. 'So what is wrong with imitating an adult in playing around with make-up?' Concerns are bound to be raised over Danna's attempts to slim her facial features with make-up, in the style of the heavy contouring technique loved by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian . Danna's tutorials, while based on the videos she has watched online are still a five-year-old's take on beauty. While some instructions are eerily adult, such as her guidance on where to place foundation, others are undeniable humorous. 'And then let's get powder on the face and neck and I'm going to put some in my ears. And I'll take this (the brush) and with it you have to do it really hard on the cheeks.' Concerns are bound to be raised over Danna's attempts to slim her features with make-up however, in the style of contouring loved by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian. In her Valentine's Day make up tutorial, Danna tells her audience, 'with white shadow, we will make the nose smaller and above also white shade and blend well.' Though the online star quickly reflects her age again, by drawing a heart on her cheek using eyeliner and ending things up with 'and the final touch will get this tiara!' 'And then I'm going to take a little white eye shadow, here, and here, and if you get it too strong like me, you have to diffuse it finely,' viewers have noted the eerily adult language used by Danna in her make-up videos .

"A 40-year-old elephant that was used to entertain holidaymakers in Vietnam has reportedly died of exhaustion at a tourist site. Vietnamese media said the overworked animal died while it was carrying tourists in the Buon Don District in Dak Lak province. It is at least the second high-profile death this year involving a captive elephant in Vietnam and comes as the population shrinks due to exhaustion and deforestation. Vietnamese media said the elephant dropped dead while carrying tourists in Dak Lak province (file photo) Tuoi Tre News said local agencies reported the elephant’s death to the People’s Committee of Krong Na Commune in the Central Highlands province, located on Vietnam’s border with Cambodia. The elephant’s carcass was examined by local authorities before it was destroyed according to current regulations, the newspaper reported. It said the animal was owned by a local man named Y Ka Tuk, who conducted an offering ceremony in accordance with traditional customs. His elephant was worth an estimated VND700million (£23,000 or $35,000). Elephant tourism is popular in Vietnam but has attracted complaints of animal cruelty from welfare groups . In January, a 36-year-old tamed elephant died when it dropped dead in the same region of Vietnam. At the time of its death it was being used to hunt for food in a forest. Elephant tourism is popular in Vietnam, like in other south-east Asian countries, but attracts plenty of criticism and  claims of animal cruelty. Tuoi Tre News said the number of captive elephants in Dak Lak has declined sharply as they die off due to old age and exhaustion from being overworked at tourist sites. Vietnamese authorities said there are only 50 tamed elephants still alive in the province.","Vietnamese media said the 40-year-old elephant died of exhaustion .

"Alan Catterall, 54, was burned to death at work when the door slammed shut on the industrial oven he was cleaning . A business has been  fined £200,000 over the death of a worker who became trapped inside an industrial oven which was then accidentally turned on by his future son-in-law. Alan Catterall, 54, died while carrying out cleaning work at Runcorn-based Kayak company, Pyranha Mouldings in December 2010. The father-of-three from Halewood, Liverpool, had gone inside to clean molten plastic escaping from a mould while the oven was switched off after a fault developed. Liverpool Crown Court heard the oven had developed a fault with a guide rail bearing and had been shut down for maintenance so the bearing could be fixed. But once the maintenance work had been completed the oven was switched back on by colleague Mark Francis, who was engaged to Mr Catterall's daughter, and put into warm-up mode. A few minutes later smoke was seen coming from the oven and when operators opened the door to find the source they discovered Mr Catterall's body. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The court heard Mr Catterall suffered severe burns and died of shock after becoming trapped in the large bespoke oven, which was designed to accommodate the moulds for two kayaks. He was a senior supervisor at the company, which manufactures kayaks and canoes, and had worked there for 12 years. Pyranha Mouldings was also found guilty of two charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Peter Mackereth, 60, managing director of the company, was convicted of two charges under Section 37 of the Health and Safety at Work Act. Sentencing was adjourned until today when the trial judge, sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, imposed the £200,000 fine. Mackereth was given a suspended sentence and a fine of £25,000. The judge imposed a total prison sentence of nine months, suspended for two years. Mr Justice MacDuff awarded costs against the two defendants jointly in the total sum of £90,000. The judge said there were 'a number of serious failings in the design of this and other moulding ovens' - the design and commissioning of which had been done in-house. Mr Justice MacDuff said Mr Catterall was 'by all accounts the most lovely of men', devoted to his family 'and loved by all'. 'He was a committed worker and had given 100% and more to his employers,' said the judge. His wife Pearl had 'behaved with dignity throughout'. He added: 'Her loss, I know, is nearly unbearable and she knows that I can do nothing to bring back her husband.' Mr Catterall, 54, died while carrying out cleaning work at Runcorn-based Kayak company, Pyranha Mouldings in December 2010. Liverpool Crown Court heard the oven had developed a fault with a guide rail bearing and had been shut down for maintenance so the bearing could be fixed.  The company was today fined £20,000 . When announcing the fine to be imposed on the company, the judge said that what happened was 'in the true sense' an accident: 'It was an avoidable accident but nevertheless an accident; an accident courted by no-one.' Referring to Mr Catterall's family, the judge said: 'At least they are able to understand that their loss was not caused by a deliberate unlawful act; rather it was a result of oversight, negligence, sins of omission and not of commission, but sins nevertheless.' Sentencing Mackereth, he said: 'You do not need me to tell you how far short of your duty you fell. It was repeatedly brought home to you at the trial. 'You will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of your life. The company may only act through its directors and senior officers. 'Whereas others were also involved, you had to accept that you took the lead in designing and commissioning these ovens. The company's failure was also your failure - although the full responsibility does not fall on your shoulders. Rightly you were not charged with gross negligence manslaughter.' The judge said he fully accepted that Mackereth and Mr Catterall were friends 'and that you were also devastated by the loss'. He told Mackereth: 'I have given the matter careful thought and have reached the conclusion that I should mark the gravity of your offending by imposing a prison sentence, albeit that there are circumstances which enable me to suspend that sentence.'","Alan Catterall, 54, died while carrying out cleaning at Pyranha Moulding .

"The US has launched airstrikes against targets in Tikrit to support Iraqi ground forces trying to push ISIS militants out of the city, a senior official said. Iraq requested the strikes, which began Wednesday and are 'ongoing,' according to the unnamed US official. An Associated Press correspondent in Tikrit reported hearing warplanes overhead late Wednesday, followed by multiple explosions. Scroll down for video . Stalled ground offensive: Smoke rose over Tikrit, where Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias have battled ISIS militants . Iraq began the Tikrit ground offensive in early March without requesting US air support, even as it welcomed help from Iran. In an address to the nation Wednesday evening, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi predicted success in Tikrit but did not say the US was providing airstrikes. 'We have started the final phase of the operation in Tikrit,' he said. ""You will liberate your ground, not anyone but you,"" he said, in a speech to the Iraqi people. Al-Abadi praised all the groups involved in the battle against the Islamic State group, including the so-called Popular Mobilization Forces, which the US calls Iranian-backed militias, the Sunni tribes and coalition forces. He fell short of confirming that the coalition is playing a direct role in Tikrit. US airstrikes in Tikrit raise highly sensitive questions about participating in an Iraqi campaign that has been spearheaded by Iraqi Shiite militias trained and equipped by Iran, an avowed US adversary. Difficulties: Militias like the Imam Ali Brigades, one of whose members is shown, have encircled ISIS forces but have been unable to dislodge them from the city . Iran has provided artillery and other weaponry for the Tikrit battle, and senior Iranian advisers have helped Iraq coordinate the offensive. Iraq pointedly did not request US air support when it launched the offensive in early March and recently, the offensive has lost momentum. Col Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said Wednesday the Iraqi forces have encircled Tikrit but not yet made significant inroads into the heavily defended city limits. 'They are stalled,' he said. The US has hundreds of military advisers in Iraq helping its security forces plan operations against the Islamic State, which occupies large chunks of northern and western Iraq. But the US has said it is not coordinating any military actions with the Iranians. Warren said that at Baghdad's request the US began aerial surveillance over Tikrit in recent days and is sharing the collected intelligence with the Iraqi government. The US-led air campaign, launched in August and joined by several European allies, has allowed Iraqi forces to halt the ISIS group's advance and claw back some of the territory militants seized last summer. Uneasy: Militiamen guarding the front line in the battle between Iraqi forces and ISIS militants, a battle which has 'stalled' recently . But the growing Iranian presence on the ground has complicated the mission, with Washington refusing to work directly with a country it views as a regional menace, yet is currently embroiled with Iran in sensitive negotiations over a nuclear deal. The prominent role of the Shiite militias in the fight to retake Tikrit and other parts of Iraq's Sunni heartland has meanwhile raised concerns that the offensive could deepen the country's sectarian divide and drive Sunnis into the arms of the Islamic State group. Hadi al-Amiri, leader of the Badr Organization and a commander of Iraq's Shiite militias, told reporters in Samarra: . 'If we need them (the US-led coalition ) we will tell them we need them. But we don't need the coalition. We have surveillance planes over our heads already. The participation of U.S. planes hinders out operations... If we need it, we'll tell our government what we need.' He claimed that the militias, the overwhelming majority of which is made up of Shiite fighters, have their own surveillance drones. 'We buy them anywhere,' he said. 'We have our own ... controlled by Iraqis.' A series of US airstrikes north of Tikrit, in the vicinity of Beiji, in recent weeks has had the indirect benefit of tying down ISIS forces that might otherwise be operating in defense of Tikrit. On Wednesday, for example, the US military said it had conducted five airstrikes Tuesday near Beiji, home of a major oil refinery that ISIS has sought to capture. That bombing targeted ISIS combat units and destroyed what the US called an ISIS 'fighting position,' as well as an ISIS armored vehicle. Warren said the Iraqis are discovering how difficult it can be to carry out ground operations in an urban area. 'We heard quite a bit from the Iraqis and some even from the Iranians — some fairly high-confidence statements about how rapidly the operations for Tikrit would go,"" Warren said. ""We've seen otherwise.' 'I think it's important that the Iraqis understand that what would be most helpful to them is a reliable partner in this fight against ISIL,' Warren said. 'Reliable, professional, advanced military capabilities are something that reside very clearly and very squarely with the coalition.'","Iraq requested the airstrikes to support an offensive begun in early March .

"The Sierra Leone sprinter claiming asylum in the UK because he says his family have died from Ebola, has been branded an 'embarrassment' by one of the country's top sporting officials. Jimmy Thoronka, 20, was found living rough on the streets of south London having not returned home after the conclusion last summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. He claims all his family in his west African homeland have succumbed to Ebola, including his adoptive mother Jelikatu Kargbo. But the runner's story, which has prompted an outpouring of public support, has been contradicted by Joseph Nyande, secretary general of Sierra Leone's National Olympics Committee. In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Nyande said: 'He absconded. We had that embarrassment. Jimmy Thoronka, 20, was found living rough on the streets of south London having not returned home since competing in the 4x100-metre relay at last summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . 'It happened in the 2012 Olympic games and when we went to Glasgow. I don't think there's anything wrong with his parents.' Months after disappearing having competed in the 4x100-metre relay in Glasgow, Thoronka was found on the street having outstayed his visa, though he was not claiming benefits and was short of money and food. He is living in Home Office accommodation near Heathrow having been arrested on Friday and quizzed by officers over whether he was carrying or using drugs, which he denied. He was released and has now officially claimed asylum. But  Abdul Karim Sesay, the vice-president of the National Olympics Committee in Sierra Leone and president of the country's athletics association, told the Guardian he backed Thoronka's story, saying Ms Kargbo did indeed die of Ebola in October. The sprinter has been branded an 'embarrassment' for 'absconding' and not returning home to west Africa . A pair of Sierra Leone Olympic officials have given two completely different accounts of Thoronka's plight . He said: 'The story about Jimmy failing to return to Sierra Leone is a big one and it is very embarrassing for the National Olympics Committee and I believe that is why there has been this attack on Jimmy. 'I and other members of the National Olympics Committee will be calling a press conference to refute the claims made by Joseph Nyande.' Thoronka said he was confused about what was happening. 'Two National Olympics Committee people are telling me two different things,' he said. 'If it can be proved that my adopted mother Jelikatu Kargbo is still alive and can continue to support me that will be very good. An online petition  to let Mr Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted nearly 70,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £28,000 to help the young athlete . 'I would be very happy to speak with her again but I have been told that she is dead and I have no family left. 'If I go home, I will have no one to help me. If they can find my adopted mother and bring her to me, I will be very happy but I think some people are trying to destroy me. 'If Joseph Nyanda is saying that my family are alive, where are they? Please can he bring them to me.' Thoronka has said he wants to claim asylum in the UK to fulfill his dream of becoming a top athlete but now faces deportation. An online petition appealing to the authorities to let him remain in the UK has so far attracted more nearly 70,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £28,000 to help the young athlete.

"Islamic State supporters have taken to social media to boast about the recruitment of a failed party loving rapper from Tunisia. Maurouane Douiri, better known by his stage name Emino, announced his decision to join ISIS by posting a picture of himself holding a goat, allegedly in Iraq. Emino appears to have abandoned his trademark ushanka hat and is shown wearing a long red and white Arab scarf. Scroll down for video . Militant: Maurouane Douiri, better known by his stage name Emino, announced his decision to join ISIS by posting a picture of himself holding a goat, allegedly in Iraq . His earlier life: Emino (pictured left) was previously one of a dozen Tunisian rappers who were vocal critics of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime . Sudden change: Having previously used his social media page to proudly show off his body, Emino's most recent photograph (left) was captioned with a declaration of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . Strangely posed holding a small brown and white goat, the once wannabe gangster wrote that he had given his allegiance to the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Emino was one of a dozen Tunisian rappers who were vocal critics of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime. Previously the 25 year old used his social media page to proudly show off photos of himself surrounded with a bevy of scantily clad ladies. One of the photos shows the rapper being touched and stroked by a group of women, with one of them appears to be drinking from a suspicious looking wine glass. Emino is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers have joined ISIS over the last few years. German rapper Denis Cuspert is the best known of the three known rappers to have been part of Islamic State . Radical: Known on stage as Deso Dogg, the wannabe gangster (left) traded in his failing career to embrace the extremist group's radical brand of Islam . Rapping jihadis: Emino is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers - including Germany's Deso Gogg (left) and America's Douglas McAuthur McCain (right)  have joined ISIS in recent years . German rapper Denis Cuspert is the best known of the three known rappers to have been part of Islamic State. Known on stage as Deso Dogg, the wannabe gangster traded in his failing career to embrace the extremist group's radical brand of Islam. American failed rapper Douglas McAuthur McCain was reportedly killed fighting for ISIS last August. McCain, who enjoyed smoking marijuana in the park and had previous convictions for disorderly conduct, is thought to have converted to Islam in 2004. After travelling to Istanbul, McCain crossed the border and entered Syria sometime in June 2014. The 33-year-old was killed whilst fighting against the Free Syrian Army in late August . His body was identified by his distinctive neck tattoo, a hallmark of his wilder days in Minnesota. Tunisia has long been a hot-bed of would be jihadist sympathetic to the ISIS cause, with an estimated 3,000 people fighting in Syria – the highest number of any country. The north African country has always been a breeding ground for terrorists, with extremists advantage of bored and jobless young men looking for an escape route. But the recent surge in numbers seems to be down to the hard-line groups which have taken advantage of the relaxing laws following the Jasmine Revolution in 2011 - including Islamist militant group Ansar al Sharia, which the United States brands as a terrorist organisation and blames for a 2012 attack on the U.S. embassy in Tunis. The government also released a number of fundamentalists from prison – allowing them to mix freely with the population once more. These groups have taken advantage of the declining economy, capitalising on the disappointment felt by those who expected a change after the Arab Spring, according to Imen Triki, a lawyer who represents returning jihadists. ‘The Arab revolutions raised an expectation that wasn't met – people thought their lives would improve, but instead they got worse,” Mr Triki told The Telegraph. ‘In Syria, they are told they’ll get houses, they’ll get wives. These people are so alienated from our society that some choose this option in a heartbeat.’ Social media is also blamed, with pictures of ISIS fighters getting thousands of likes and recruiters using Facebook to find any potential fighters, much like is seen in the UK. But with the rise of ISIS in Libya, to the east, and al-Qaeda affiliated groups in Algeria, to the west, it is now easy to join a ‘jihad’, and get arms into Tunisia itself. ‘Tunisia is surrounded by jihadist groups in the mountains who coordinate with the terrorists in Libya ... Libya is the main source of arms for jihadists in Tunisia,’ said Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa. But despite this, Tunisia is seen as the success story of the Arab Spring, and tourist numbers have been on the increase once more as people begin to feel the area is safe once more. In 2013, 6.27million people visited Tunisia. Of those, almost 330,000 were British, while 985,000 were French.","Maurouane Douiri was previously known as a womanizing gangster rapper .

"A new species of mushroom that looks like a man has been discovered by the side of a road. The fungus, found in Cockley Cley, Norfolk, has fleshy off-shoots that appear to resemble human heads, arms and legs.

Mr Revett, 49, said: 'They do look like little mushroom men. 'It's really strange how their shape makes them look like they have a head and arms. That's what drew my attention to them.' Despite first spotting them in 2000, the fungus was dismissed as a species of earthstar fungi which is prevalent in Norfolk.

However, 15 years later, mycologists in Spain carried out DNA sequence analysis and have just confirmed they differ slightly. Mr Revett - who runs the mycology website fenfungi.com - said: 'It felt brilliant knowing I'd found something new. 'I wouldn't normally question the experts but I just knew these were different.

"The mother of murdered British student Meredith Kercher is 'surprised and very shocked' by an Italian court's decision to overturn the convictions of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito. The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation, which was announced late last night, is the final ruling in the case, ending the long legal battle waged by Ms Knox and her ex-boyfriend. Ms Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy. Arline Kercher said she was 'surprised and very shocked' at the Italian court's decision. Here she is pictured during a press conference in Perugia, Italy, following Knox and Sollecito's original convictions in 2009 . Knox and Sollecito were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively before their convictions were overturned. Arline Kercher, Meredith's mother, said she had heard little more about the decision other than the verdict. She said: 'I am a bit surprised, and very shocked, but that is about it at the moment. They have been convicted twice, so it's a bit odd that it should change now.' Asked whether she had any plans following the ruling, she said: 'I really don't know at the moment, I haven't got any plans. 'I can't see how evidence that was once deemed evidence is now no longer thought to be evidence. I am still shocked.' Talking about the Italian legal system she said: 'It is a long drawn out process.' She then added: 'If you write anything, never forget Meredith.' Meredith's father John declined to comment this evening. Ms Kercher (pictured left and right) was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 . Following Knox and Sollecito's original conviction, the two served four years in prison before a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent. Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years. Now Italy's highest court in Rome has overturned the second convictions and declined to order another trial. Both Knox, who was awaiting the verdict in her home town of Seattle, and Sollecito have long maintained their innocence.","Italian supreme court has overturned the convictions of Knox and Sollecito .

"Tory minister Hugo Swire has been filmed cracking jokes about benefit claimants . Tory minister Hugo Swire has been filmed cracking jokes about benefit claimants at a glamorous party fundraiser. The foreign office minister hosted an auction at the dinner at which donors bid for high-value items – and suggested even those living on welfare could afford to pay £60,000. Mr Swire was the star turn at the secretive Black and White Ball, at which ministers and senior MPs mingle with financiers, industry bosses and other donors to raise money for the General Election. Covert filming of the event has shown Mr Swire - a former director of Sotheby’s - acting as the auctioneer, selling lots including a shoe shopping session with Theresa May, and dinner with Boris Johnson. While bidding is underway for one item, he is heard trying to persuade a guest, who is sitting on the table of Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, to increase his bid. ‘£60,000?’, he says. ‘Ian, persuade him. He’s not on benefits is he? Well if he is then he can afford it.’ He then goes lower, suggesting ‘£55,000?’ At another point in the auction, he comments on the expensive cars the guests are driving. ‘It’s quite naff to have Bentley’s and Rolls Royce and Ferraris because anybody could have them’, he says. And in a reference to the lifestyle of MPs before the 2009 expenses scandal, he said: ‘In the good old days of MP’s expenses we could have them too, but we don’t anymore’. His comments will embarrass the party, after ministers have repeatedly said that the drive to cut welfare has meant ‘difficult decisions’. Unemployment benefit is worth up to £72.40 a week. Old Etonian Mr Swire was elected the MP for East Devon in 2001. He is related to the Swire Group trading dynasty in Hong Kong. During the expenses scandal he was found to have claimed £395 for a laptop bag from the designer brand Mulberry, which he repaid. The footage provides the first public view inside the Ball at the Grosvenor House Hotel – for which donors have paid between £500 and £1,500 a ticket. It was obtained by Paul Wilmott, a hedge fund boss who joined all three major political parties offering a £50,000 donation, in order to highlight the issue of cash for access to politicians for Channel’s 4’s Dispatches programme shown last night. The table plan this year was kept a closely-guarded secret but Mr Willmott, who sat with Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb, said Mr Cameron was on a table with hedge fund manager Andrew Law, City broker Michael Spencer and Ann Summers tycoon Jacqueline Gold. The final bids for the auction items and who bought them is not made public after the dinner, although all donations over £7,500 are properly declared to the Electoral Commission. Hugo Swire was the star turn at the secretive Black and White Ball, at which ministers and senior MPs mingle with financiers, industry bosses and other donors to raise money for the General Election . The fake donor used by Dispatches Paul Wilmott was able to shake hands with David Cameron at the Tory Black and White Ball . Subaskaran Allirajah, the founder of the telephone company Lyca Mobile who sat at a table with treasury minister David Gauke, bid £210,000 for a small bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher. Mr Wilmott shakes hands with David Cameron, and also meets Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, four cabinet ministers and two members of the shadow cabinet, shortly after offering financial support. He approached the Conservative party around six months ago and was also invited to lunch with health secretary Jeremy Hunt along with other donors. Sir Alistair Graham, the former commissioner for standards in public life told Dispatches: ‘I suspect not a lot of policy issues are dealt with at a dinner like that. But I think it’s about that feeling, if I make reasonable donations, I’m in a special club who’ve got access to leaders and that might be extremely useful as far as my business is concerned in the future.’ The Conservative party say ‘the fact that donors are invited to attend events with senior figures within the party is clearly and openly stated on our website.’ They deny any impropriety and say all donations are properly declared to the Electoral Commission. Mr Swire was not available for comment. Mr Wilmott is also filmed having a private meeting with Labour’s Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, to discuss tax matters which could benefit his firm – after offering a donation. Mr Leslie tells him in a follow-up email that he will consider Mr Wilmott’s views about a possible tax on financial transactions ‘ahead of our manifesto’. Labour denied that donors influence party policy. The same businessman approached Labour offering a donation, and was swiftly offered a private meeting with a shadow minister. Paul Wilmott discussed making a donation to the party at last autumn’s annual conference in Manchester, and was invited to a £350-a-head donors’ dinner for free. There, he shook hands with leader Ed Miliband and sat with shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan and small business spokesman Toby Perkins MP. Fake donor Paul Wilmott was put in touch with shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie after offering to make a donation . Back in London, he was put in touch with shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie to discuss the policy he was particularly interested in – a tax on financial transactions which Labour is considering. Over tea at a hotel in Westminster, he is filmed giving his views on the tax and explains how it could help his fictional firm developing software for the hedge fund industry. In a follow-up email, Mr Leslie tells him: ‘Many thanks for this Paul…I think you make some good points about the best way to introduce an FTT…I’ll have a good think about some of these good points ahead of our manifesto but I appreciate any updates you might have along the way.’ Sir Alistair Graham, ex-standards commissioner said: ‘The point about having access to opposition key leaders like Chris Leslie is of course normally their policies are much more fluid. They’re trying to develop policies they think are going to be attractive to the public and you see a specific reference to the manifesto…’ ‘I suspect that the Labour Party would have been quite happy to have his input given his expertise but in this particular case the meeting happened very quickly because he was a prospective donor.’ A Labour party spokesman said frontbenchers regularly meet with business leaders to listen to their views and that ‘donations will not influence our policy.’ Channel 4's Dispatches: How to Buy a Meeting with a Minister .","Hugo Swire hosted an auction for donors to bid for high-value items .

"Theresa May yesterday unveiled a raft of controversial powers to drive Muslim extremists from British public life – including the closure of mosques which harbour fanatics. The Home Secretary said Britain had tolerated extremist views for too long and hardliners needed to understand the 'game is up' for anybody who rejects British values. Her wish-list included sending hit squads modelled on the Government's Troubled Families Programme into 'isolated' communities to teach English and encourage children to mix with youngsters from other backgrounds. Home Secretary Theresa May (above) will promise to drive out the 'significant' number of fanatics who have been able to infiltrate British establishments . As the Mail revealed yesterday, there will also be new civil orders to silence preachers of hate, a review of sharia courts and new rules making it easier to ban extremist groups. Closure orders for mosques or other premises hosting extremist meetings . Blacklist of people and bodies public sector should not engage with . All foreign religious workers in pastoral roles required to speak English . Orders making it unlawful to preach hate in public or on the internet . Banning orders for extremist groups that fall short of existing terrorist proscription thresholds . Migrants arriving on visas must declare they will respect British values . Independent review of operation of sharia courts . Ban on asylum for terror suspects . Translation services cut . Public spending on translation services will be cut to encourage all Muslims to speak English. It will be a requirement for religious workers with pastoral responsibilities to learn the language. Meanwhile, a new Extremism Analysis Unit is being established inside the Home Office to draw up a blacklist of individuals and organisations which the public sector should not engage with. Mrs May said the aim was to ensure 'nobody unwittingly lends legitimacy or credibility to extremists' and ensure ministers don't just speak to 'self-appointed and often unrepresentative community leaders'. Closure orders would be served on any premises owned or occupied by extremists or used to host extremist speakers – including mosques. She called for a new partnership to defeat the fanatics, saying: 'To those who do not want to join this new partnership, to those who choose consciously to reject our values and the basic principles of our society, the message is equally clear: the game is up. We will no longer tolerate your behaviour.' Mrs May told Islamist hardliners: 'The game is up. We will no longer tolerate your behaviour. We will expose your hateful beliefs for what they are' Mrs May is expected to set out priorities for a Tory government - including a review of Sharia courts and powers to stop preachers of hate like  Anjem Choudary (pictured) from public speaking or using social media . Lord Prescott . Policy failures are partly to blame for Islamic extremism in Britain, John Prescott claimed yesterday. The Labour grandee, who has been recruited into the party's election campaign by Ed Miliband, said events in the Middle East could have radicalised him too. 'Any young Muslim would be affected by the indiscriminate killing either by Islamic State or Western military technology,' he said. 'This kind of crusade started with the invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of an elected Muslim government in Egypt, and continues with Syria.' He said young Muslims would inevitably 'identify and seek to support what they perceive as their cause and their people'. In his Sunday Mirror column he added: 'Perhaps we might find their radicalisation is more to do with their sense of justice and what they've seen on the television and in the papers.' But Anthony Glees of Buckingham University said Lord Prescott was guilty of a cynical rant. 'These words are incredible coming from someone who was deputy prime minister,' added the politics professor. 'He shows a complete misunderstanding of historical facts and of the present danger which the country faces. Lord Prescott is deliberately fanning the flames. His facts are mixed up.' Lord Prescott served under Tony Blair through the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the British military intervention in Afghanistan, before leaving office in 2007. Tory MPs welcomed her uncompromising stance in which she criticised those who sought to excuse Islamist extremism as mere 'social conservatism'. But, published less than two months before the election, her plan is a list of ambitions rather than a blueprint for Government. The measures will be included in the Tory manifesto but, in the event of a new Coalition, would be fiercely resisted by the Liberal Democrats. The speech was seen at Westminster as a reminder of Mrs May's leadership credentials if David Cameron stands down after the election. MPs said it had echoes of Margaret Thatcher, who once declared: 'Where there is discord, may we bring harmony.' Comparisons were also made with Tony Blair's 12-point plan for tackling terror, unveiled in the aftermath of the 7/7 attacks. The Labour Prime Minister famously declared that the 'rules of the game are changing' but later abandoned his own proposal for mosque closure orders after a backlash from Muslim groups. Mrs May's plans follow a series of bitter rows inside the Coalition over counter-terrorism strategy. The Liberal Democrats have made it clear they will oppose any attempt to limit free speech. At least four Tory Cabinet ministers, including Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, are also understood to have argued the strategy needs more work. The proposals drew an angry response from some Muslim groups. Islamic Human Rights Commission chairman Massoud Shadjareh said: 'Nobody will be fooled by the Home Secretary's claims that these measures are designed to tackle extremism. 'They are a shameless expression of a hate and bigotry that is increasingly becoming normalised in Britain.' Manzoor Moghal, chairman of the Muslim Forum think tank, said the proposals would infringe people's freedom of speech. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'Everyone other than the extremists agrees we should robustly defend and actively promote the pluralistic values our society rightly holds in esteem. But it isn't enough for the Home Secretary to say it, she needs to act.' The Home Office defines extremism as 'vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs'. It also includes 'calls for the death of members of armed forces whether in this country or overseas'.","Theresa May wants to drive out 'significant' number of fanatics in Britain .

"It has long been claimed by allotment-holders that their fruit and vegetables beat those from supermarket shelves. Now scientists have proved home-grown produce is not just tastier but healthier too. A study, carried out by experts at Kew Gardens, found that tomatoes are sweeter and richer in health-improving nutrients than those that are mass-produced. Flavoursome: A Kew Gardens study found that home-grown tomatoes are sweeter and richer in health-improving nutrients than those that are mass-produced . The concentration of natural sugars, anti-oxidants and nutrient rich compounds called phenols peaked in the home-grown tomatoes, the study for a BBC show revealed. Professor Monique Simmonds, deputy director of science at Kew, claimed mass-market tomatoes are often bred for their appearance rather than quality, that herbicides are used and that they are harvested early and artificially ripened to improve shelf life. She said all these things can damage the flavour and the nutrient level in the fruit. 'Supermarkets are often looking for tomatoes that are a particular size because that's how the public want it,' she said. 'Some of these tomatoes are smaller and they don't grow in a uniform size, which makes them difficult for supermarkets to sell. It's about educating the public. People don't mind if something grown in their garden is not beautifully round but would they buy it from a supermarket?' One example is the Gardener's Delight cherry tomato, which was found to contain three times as much sugar as the shop-bought variety, giving it a far sweeter taste. While this experiment was with tomatoes, Professor Simmonds said results would be similar in other fruits and vegetables. Tasty: Professor Simmonds from Kew Gardens said results would be similar in other fruits and vegetables . Professor Simmonds, who led the research for BBC2 show Kew on a Plate, said: 'They are not going to be a cure for a disease but if you are eating them as part of a mixed diet they will definitely contribute to a healthier life – it's the Mediterranean diet effect, having natural anti-oxidants in your diet. 'If you're eating enough of these it will build up to have an effect.' The show, starting on Monday, follows presenter Kate Humble, 46, and chef Raymond Blanc, 65, as they create a vegetable garden. The experiment saw Professor Simmonds take the pulp from different varieties of tomatoes and analyse it using sophisticated machinery to work out the concentration of different sugars and nutrients.","Study found that home-grown tomatoes are sweeter and richer in nutrients .

"A team of researchers have trained stingrays to memorise targets and work for their food. The test, which was conducted by a team of researchers at Reef HQ in Townsville, northern Queensland, is intended to enhance the lives of stingrays living in captivity. The test, which is the first enrichment program to ever be tested on stingrays, works by improving the memory of the cartilaginous fish, reports ABC. Researchers in Townsville conduct tests on stingrays to make them work for their food . One of the aquarists involved in the study Laura Coulton said it has been an overwhelming success. 'We created individual targets for each of the three stingrays we have here,' she said. 'At first we used some food to bait them towards the target so they became familiar with it. But very quickly, within a week, when we put the targets in they were coming straight to it.' Another researcher from the project, James Cook University researcher Sara-Louise McCracken, said the test is intended to break up the monotony of caged animal's lifestyle. 'We're wanting to change the monotony and the routines of the daily regimes that can be associated with captive species,' she said. 'So instead of just being presented with their food at the same time every day, with no interaction or thought behind it, we're really making them earn their living, which is a really innate and natural behaviour. James Cook University researcher Sara-Louise McCracken, said the test is intended to break up the monotony of caged animal's lifestyle . The researchers also hope the tests could allow them to capture the animals with more ease in the future . 'We have to keep them thinking, keep them moving, and give them something different in their day-to-day routine.' The researchers also hope the tests could allow them to capture the animals with more ease in the future. If the stingray's can memorise the targets, they will be easier to move between exhibits.","The test was conducted by a team of researchers  in northern Queensland .

"The number of pizza take outs compared with gym memberships may give you some idea of a city's obesity rates. But scientists say to really understand an area's weight problems you need to go underground into the grimy depths of the sewage network. Here, they claim, raw waste can be analysed to reveal the urban 'microbiome', offering glimpses into disease trends on a wider scale. Humans harbour tremendous amounts of bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract and gut bacteria. Lifestyle differences can alter the human gut microbiome, and microbial community composition of an individual with obesity. Now scientists say this community can be analysed from a community's sewage system . Studies of the human microbiome, the collection of trillions of microbes living in and on the human body, have gained traction during the last decade. Scientists are hoping to identify a 'healthy microbiome' by finding one or more bacterial community types that may be linked with healthy individuals. In a recent study by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, sewage samples were collected from 71 cities across the US. According to the researchers, a microbial study of that sewage helped them predict each city's obesity rates with 81 to 89 per cent accuracy. The skinniest city sampled was Steamboat Springs, Colorado, with an obesity rate of 13.5 per cent, while the heaviest was St. Joseph, Missouri, with a rate of 37.4 per cent. While scientists have known this for some time, this is the first study to reveal the same holds true when these microbiomes are mixed together in the sewage network. Using computer power, the team were able to to rapidly sequence microbial populations and look for patterns in the results . This is because humans harbour tremendous amounts of bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract and gut bacteria. Lifestyle differences can alter the human gut microbiome, and microbial community composition of an individual with obesity. While scientists have known this for some time, this is the first study to reveal the same holds true when these microbiomes are mixed together in the sewage network. Where there is muck there really is brass with scientists claiming that millions can be made by extracting gold from human waste. In fact as well as gold, faeces contains platinum, silver and other metals along with rare elements such as palladium and vanadium. Researchers now hope to 'mine' sewage reducing the need to mine raw metals from the ground, while reducing pollution by recycling human waste. Previous research estimated the waste from one million Americans could contain as much as $12 million (£8.7 million) worth of metals. In 1999 the UK produced over 1,130,000 tonnes of sludge dry solids. If Britain's waste was mined it could be worth $762 million (£510 million) a year. Dr Kathleen Smith of the US Geological Survey said: 'If you can get rid of some of the nuisance metals that currently limit how much of these biosolids we can use on fields and forests, and at the same time recover valuable metals and other elements, that's a win-win.' The study used a technique known as oligotyping which exploits subtle variations gene data. Using computer power, the team were able to to rapidly sequence microbial populations and look for patterns in the results. Overall, scientists compared the gut bacterial community profiles of 137 healthy adults provided by The Human Microbiome Project to the bacterial community profiles of more than 200 sewage samples. 'This method is similar to trying to create a map of a geographical region,' explains Murat Eren, an Assistant Research Scientist at the MBL, and one of the authors of the study. 'The way we have been working with microbiomes of individuals has been similar to driving around and mapping the streets and structures of a city in a detailed manner. 'This approach takes our efforts to a much larger scale. 'In this sense it is similar to taking one big aerial picture of a city, trading off intricate details of a small number of well-described streets for broader insights and larger patterns.' The researchers say the use of oligotyping, which provides greater sensitivity, allowed them to better explain the distribution of very closely related bacterial organisms to compare microbiomes among 71 human populations. 'The sewage samples of 71 cities do not tell us anything specific about 'individuals' who live in those cities' added Eren. 'However, only using sewage samples, we were able to differentiate these cities based on their estimated level of obesity. 'This approach can be beneficial to answer various public health questions while not compromising the privacy of individuals.'","Researchers collected sewage samples from 71 cities across the US .

"Dozens of pupils were given detentions for watching the solar eclipse – at a school that had boasted it would be celebrating the ‘rare and spectacular’ phenomenon. But only younger children at the Merseyside secondary were allowed to watch the once-in-a-generation event, with the rest of the school ordered to remain indoors. Hilbre High School, Wirral, had announced an eclipse-based science project with its younger pupils, who had spent the previous week making safety goggles so they could watch it, saying: ‘Key Stage 3 will be focused on the rare and spectacular event. Hilbre High School (pictured) in Wirral, Merseyside, organised an eclipse-based project with its younger pupils but told the rest of the school to stay indoors . 'It is great to see students engaging in real-life events.’ But the ban on older children watching the eclipse sparked a revolt, with an entire class skipping lessons so they would not miss out. Almost 30 Year 10 pupils streamed out into the streets to watch the moon pass in front of the sun, only to be given immediate detentions. Orders: The school (pictured logo) gave detentions for the class of 30 children that skipped lessons after warning about looking at the eclipse with the naked eye . Last night, parents complained their children had been punished just for showing curiosity about the world around them. Clifford Stott, whose daughter was one of those given a detention, said: ‘It was the perfect platform for engaging the children with a whole range of educational issues – physics, mathematics and cosmology. 'To punish them does little more than alienate them. I feel outraged.’ The school insisted it had punished the children for disobeying warnings during assembly at the start of the day about the dangers of looking at the eclipse with the naked eye. Principal Jan Levenson said: ‘It was a question of safety. At the heart of this has been the protection of children from the harmful effects of viewing the eclipse without proper eye protection.’ During detention, she added, pupils were asked to ‘reflect on their misbehaviour, their truanting and the fact they put themselves at very serious risk’. The solar eclipse on Friday morning was the first this century and there won't be another one for 19 years .","Hilbre High School announced an eclipse-based project for younger pupils .

"Messages: Konstandinos Erik Scurfield kept in touch with friends through Facebook . Messages from the first Brit to be killed fighting ISIS have revealed frustration at the Kurds' lack of discipline - and his fear the 'Corps' would tell his mother he had gone to Syria. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, who died while fighting against the terror group with the Kurdistan People's Protection Units (YPG), kept his friends updated through Facebook after heading to war-torn Syria in December. The former Royal Marine's posts and messages give a glimpse of day-to-day life for those fighting ISIS, advises interested friends on how to join up and reveals the Kurdish fighters lack of discipline, but huge determination. But it seems he was most worried about his mother finding out where he was. The messages, published by The Sun, reveal Mr Scurfield began looking for a way to get out to Syria to join up with the YPG at least a month before he arrived in Syria. He was recruited by the Lions of Rojava, and by November 3 had clear plans in place for reaching their base in Syria. On December 6, using a Facebook account set up under a fake name so his friends could keep in touch, he messages to say he has arrived safely in Syria, and met up with two other foreign fighters. But his parents still apparently had no idea where he was - with Mr Scurfield, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, revealing on December 15: 'I've heard about the authorities threatening to tell my parents!' It is thought the 25-year-old told his friends he was going to do humanitarian work in the war-torn country last year after being 'horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS'. It is unclear what Mr Scurfield told his parents,  archaeologists Chris and Vicci. Mr Scurfield (pictured kneeling, centre) revealed foreign fighters frustration with the Kurds lack of discipline, but also recorded how impressed he was with their attitude . Eventually, it seems the Royal Marines did take matters into their own hands, informing his parents sometime between Christmas and January 5. In his final Facebook post, Mr Scurfield, who was an expert in battlefield medicine, revealed: 'The Corps told my mum and I think she's taken it pretty well, I might even think she is a little bit proud.' The messages and posts also give an idea of what foreign fighters heading for Syria to fight with the YPG can expect. Mr Scurfield revealed 'quite a lot of Westerners' pack up and leave after a short time, disappointed by the Kruds' 'skills and drills'. But Mr Scurfield was impressed by the attitude of the Kurdish fighters - who are the only troops on the ground fighting . 'The Kurds don't do stuff like us but they never drip about going on patrol,' he wrote. Tributes: Fellow-fighters said Mr Scurfield (pictured) 'gave his life combating terrorism for his nation' Warrior: Fellow fighters in Mr Scurfield's 'Lions of Rojava' group have posted tributes to him online . Mr Scurfield's messages also reveal he was waiting for fighting to intensify once more, which would happen in February and March, after the winter came to an end. But then there is silence from the former soldier, and nothing more is thought to have been heard by friends, who were told this week he died on Monday was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. Friends, both in the UK and Syria, have paid tribute to him since. Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now  fighting in Syria, wrote: 'Words cannot describe how honored I have been to fight at your side Sehid Kemal (Konstandinos Erik Scurfield). 'We were together from his first day here and you couldn't ask for a more disciplined warrior.'","Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was killed fighting Islamic State on Monday .

"Kim Kardashian has made no secret of her  frequent attempts to get pregnant with her second child. Speaking on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the 34-year-old reality star said she was 'desperate' to conceive a sibling for baby North - to the point where she and Kanye were having intercourse multiple times per day. And now, one fertility expert has offered some insight into Kim's struggle, suggesting that the global star's hectic lifestyle may be to blame. Kim Kardashian, who is already mother to one-year-old North West, has said she is 'desperate' to conceive a sibling for her daughter... but one fertility expert says her hectic lifestyle may be to blame . Speaking to new! magazine, Mr Paul Serhal, Medical Director at CRGH, a leading fertility clinic in London, said: 'Kim should reduce her hectic lifestyle in order to increase her chances.' Kim - who has been flying all over the world over fashion month, starring in shoots and tending to the needs of her one-year-old daughter - needs to take a break, says Mr Serhal. 'Flying is a common cause of infertility in high-profile, professional women because it can impact on the regularity of the ovulation cycle. Speaking on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the 34-year-old reality star said she wants to conceive a sibling for baby North - to the point where she and Kanye were having intercourse multiple times per day . 'Ovulation time is critical because women aren’t fertile throughout the whole month. This is another reason IVF could be a good option for Kim. You collect ten or 11 eggs and effectively pack one year of ovulation into one IVF cycle of treatment.' Mr Serhal believes that thanks to her age, Kim, who has already proved she can conceive naturally,  would have a very good chance of getting pregnant with IVF. He explains that women in their 30s - like Kim - have a 60 per cent chance of conceiving through IVF. Kim, who has been flying all over the world over fashion month, needs to take a break, says Mr Serhal . On the E! show, Kim was seen lying supine to allow Kanye's sperm to 'marinade' inside her. 'The doctors said I have to lie down for 1- minutes after sex...and I had sex just before you got here,' Kim said as her sisters groaned in disgust. 'Lying flat after sex wont make any difference,' said Mr Serhal. Instead, he suggests that she should maintain a healthy  diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid prolonged exposure to heat to help her chances of falling pregnant with a little brother or sister for baby North. Mr Serhal believes that thanks to her age, Kim, who has already proved she can conceive naturally with husband Kanye, pictured with North over the weekend, would have a very good chance of getting pregnant with IVF .

"The first family is not the true purchaser of a sprawling beachfront home used in the filming of the 1980s television show Magnum, P.I. that sold for $8.7 million to a close friend of President Barack Obama, the White House said on Friday. Asked if there was any 'truth' to rumors that the 'Obamas are behind this purchase' White House spokesman Josh Earnest smirked and said, 'They are not.' An attorney for Marty Nesbitt, a close friend of the president and first lady from their days in Chicago, said Thursday that his client bought the property. The lawyer, Seth Madorsky, said Nesbitt didn't have any partners or co-investors in the deal. These undated photos, provided by LIST Sotheby's International Realty, show the Waimanalo, Hawaii, home used for the filming of the 1980s television show 'Magnum, P.I.' The 3-acre oceanfront property has sold for $8.7 million to a close friend of President Barack Obama . The first family is not the true purchaser of the sprawling beachfront home, the White House said on Friday. The 3-acre oceanfront property is in Waimanalo, next to the town of Kailua where the Obama family has spent the winter holidays in recent years . Known as 'Pahonu,' the property has been owned by single family since its construction before its recent sale . Bobby Titcomb, left, tries to block President Barack Obama, center, and Marty Nesbitt, right, as an errant shot from one of their other playing partners lands nearby  while playing golf with friends at the Mid Pacific Country Club in Kailua, Hawaii, on December 28, 2010. An attorney for Marty Nesbitt, a close friend of the president and first lady from their days in Chicago, said Thursday that his client bought the Hawaii property in question . The 3-acre oceanfront property is in Waimanalo, next to the town of Kailua where the Obama family has spent the winter holidays in recent years. That it's close to an Air Force base and has a maid's house that could house security officers - a Secret Service requirement - had Fox News speculating on Friday afternoon that the Obamas might be the intended, future occupants of the abode. Tom Selleck's character, Robin Masters, lived in the house on Magnum P.I. It was known as 'Robin's Nest' on the show. Many of the scenes from the show were not actually taped at the residence, however, and were instead shot in a studio. According to real estate website Zillow, the Spanish Colonial style residence was built in 1933. Known as 'Pahonu,' the property has been owned by single family since its construction before its recent sale. In addition to a five-bedroom and 5.5 bath 11,054 square foot main residence, Zillow states that the property features a 'historic turtle pond,' tennis courts, a gate house, boat house, four-car carriage house and a bath house. 'A truly rare and lifetime opportunity,' the listing states. It also accesses a private beach. The Obamas still own a home on the South Side of Chicago, but they rarely visit it anymore. Instead, they spend their winter vacations in Hawaii, the president's birth state. The president is pictured here in December of 2011 with daughters Malia, left, and Sasha, right, as well as Nesbitt, back right, after a visit to Sea Life Park - which is located right next to the Pahonu property Nesbitt just purchased . That it's close to an Air Force base and has a maid's house that could house security officers - a Secret Service requirement - prompted speculation that the Obamas might be the intended future occupants of thehouse . Manicured: The house is set in extensive and well-maintained grounds - which the White House said the Obamas would not be enjoying . Nesbitt is a Chicago businessman who served as treasurer for Obama's first presidential run. He is the chairman of the Barack Obama Foundation, which will build the president's future library. He remains one of the first family's closest friends, and is one of Obama's most frequent golf partners. The two have played together 18 times since the former Illinois senator moved into the White House, according to Politico, including several times in Hawaii. The Obamas still own a home on the South Side of Chicago, but they rarely visit it. Instead, they spend their winter vacations in Hawaii, the president's birth state. Their favorite restaurant, the critically acclaimed Alan Wong's, is also located in the Hawaiian islands. Meals there cost $75 a person. The cost rises to $105 each when paired with wine. As Politico notes, it wouldn't be unprecedented for the Obamas to purchase a new home through a family friend and allow it to lay in wait while still living at the White House. George W. Bush and Laura Bush acquired their Dallas, Texas, home in the name of the then-president’s personal accountant, Robert McCleskey. McCleskey came up with the funds by taking out a loan from a Midland, Texas, bank. But the Bushes didn't deny that they'd purchased, accommodations, though they wouldn't say where, and they waited until the final months of the 43rd president's tenure to to attain the property.

"Desmond Brooks (pictured) stabbed his wife Keisha McKenzie to death in front of their screaming seven year-old son during a horrific knife rampage . A Jamaican man stabbed his estranged wife to death and then and tried to kill a former partner because he was 'fed up of their nagging'. Desmond Brooks, 42, of Brixton, South London, stabbed his wife Keisha McKenzie, 28, to death in front of their screaming seven year-old son during a horrific 30-minute knife rampage. The frenzied attacks at two homes just 350 metres apart also left Brooks' 46 year-old 'babymother' Joan Wade and Ms McKenzie's 17-year-old sister Saffron Yeboah-Simpson permanently disfigured with life-threatening injuries. Miss Yeboah-Simpson, an art and design student, was repeatedly stabbed after she tried to intervene to save her sister and pull her young nephew to safety. Jamaican national Brooks, who was facing deportation after serving a 12 month jail sentence for possessing cannabis, was arrested five hours later on a bus after telling the driver to flag police down. He told officers: 'I want to hand myself in. 'I killed my wife earlier. I couldn't take it any more. I killed my wife and hurt my baby's mother. 'My babymother told me to hand myself in. I couldn't take it any more, nagging me all day, disrespecting me in front of others, couldn't take it any more.' Brooks is now facing at least 29 years in prison after admitting murder, the attempted murder of Ms Wade and grievous bodily harm with intent of Miss Yeboah-Simpson. Prosecutor Simon Russell-Flint QC said Brooks came to the UK in 2002 and stayed here on a student visa until he married Ms McKenzie in September 2003. They had a son in 2006 but had split up by 2009 when he started a relationship with Ms Wade and had a son with her in 2010. By the time of the murder, the couple had separated and there were active deportation proceedings under way. The court heard that he would 'inevitably' be sent back to Jamaica once he has served his sentence. Keisha McKenzie (pictured) was stabbed to death by her estranged husband Brooks in front of their son. She suffered at least 42 separate injuries including a cut to her jugular vein and punctures to both lungs . Although he had split up with her and started seeing another women they were still living together at a flat in  Brixton at the time of the attacks on July 29 2013. The court heard Brooks launched the attack on Ms Wade 'out of the blue' after collecting their son from nursery. At around 6.30pm he went into the kitchen and approached Ms Wade as she lay on the sofa, and told her: 'I'm gonna kill you.' Brooks then began stabbing and hacking at her with a meat cleaver as she desperately tried to defend herself with her hands. She managed to retreat on to a balcony but he followed her and continued the attack while she shouted 'murder, murder'. As well as multiple stab wounds, two of Ms Wade's fingers were chopped off as she tried to guard herself from the onslaught and her lip and tongue were sliced through. Brooks is now facing at least 29 years in prison after admitting murder, the attempted murder of Ms Wade and grievous bodily harm with intent of Miss Yeboah-Simpson at this block of flats in Brixton, South London . A doctor later described the self-defence injuries to her hands as 'one of the worst hand injuries I have ever seen.' Ms Wade, 48, told police: 'I haven't got a clue why this happened. It is not like we had an argument or anything.' Brooks then made his way to Ms McKenzie's home. When she opened the front door Brooks told her: 'Suck your mum Keisha, you are for dead.' He then attacked her with a knife he had brought from Ms Wade's flat. Her sister, Miss Yeboah-Simpson emerged to find Ms McKenzie on her knees in the hallway with Brooks standing over her stabbing her in the chest. The prosecutor said: 'She jumped on the defendant's back to stop him continuing the attack but he managed to push her away. 'She pushed him away but again he pushed her out of the way. It was at this point she saw he was holding a knife.' Brooks then began stabbing Miss Yeboah-Simpson in the head and tried to stab her in the stomach before turning back to Keisha, who was lying defenceless on the floor. The attack took place in front of their sobbing seven-year-old son. The court heard Brooks then  said 'Suck your mum' again before leaving the flat. By the time police arrived Ms McKenzie had already stopped breathing and was pronounced dead at 7.31pm. She had suffered 42 separate injuries including a cut to her jugular vein and punctures to both lungs. Mr Russell-Flint said: 'Both Joan Wade and Saffron Yeboah-Simpson suffered significant and potentially life threatening injuries. 'They have both been left permanently disfigured as a result of the attacks on them.' The court heard following the attack Brooks boarded a bus at 7.05pm and made a series of phone calls, telling a friend of Ms Wade: 'I just killed Joan and my wife.' Police forensics officers at the scene following the bloody rampage which saw Brooks kill his estranged wife . He also told his current girlfriend 'I am fed up of it' and told her the women 'took him for a boy'. Brooks was arrested after midnight on another bus in Leigham Court Road, Streatham, still wearing the same blood-stained clothing. He made no comment in interview and now claims he cannot remember anything about the attack. His mental health deteriorated in September 2013 and three months later he was transferred to Broadmoor Hospital, where he is still being treated for paranoid schizophrenia. Mr Russell-Flint said the Home Office had been pursuing Brooks' deportation as a result of his drugs conviction in September 2012. Police outside the flat where Brooks attacked his former partner. He has now been jailed for life . He had been released from prison about ten weeks before the attacks, the court heard. His barrister Elizabeth Marsh QC said Brooks 'could not believe' what he had done, adding he may have been suffering from previously undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenia which had only been identified since he was on remand. She said: 'He's at a loss as to why he hurt three of the women closest to him. He cannot understand now what would have provoked him.' Judge Stephen Kramer QC said: 'Over the period of about an hour you engaged in a stabbing spree properly said by your counsel to have been one of extreme violence and ferocity. 'The catalogue of injuries inflicted is truly appalling. 'It is clear that what you did has had deeply damaging physical and psychological effects.' The judge said he took into account psychiatrists' reports on Brooks' mental illness, although the court heard there was evidence to suggest that he may have feigned some symptoms. While on remand at Belmarsh Prison, Brooks had tried to kill himself and was transferred to Broadmoor hospital where he has remained, the court heard. Brooks has now been jailed for life with a minimum sentence of 29 years. Brooks was also jailed for 19 years concurrent for attempted murder and 12 years concurrent for GBH with intent. Relatives of the victims held hands and tearfully hugged each other as he was sentenced. Speaking after today's hearing, Ms McKenzie's family said: 'After 20 months the family of Keisha McKenzie are satisfied that we finally have some justice for Keisha. 'We have lost Keisha forever but no amount of years will bring back the loving mother and bubbly, smiley daughter, auntie and sister that we all knew and loved. 'We would like to thank the investigating team and all who have supported us during this traumatic and difficult time.' Investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Will Reynolds, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, added: 'Brooks went on a lengthy and extremely violent rampage, intent on harming the women in his life. 'Keisha's injuries were so severe she never stood a chance while Joan is still recovering from her horrendous ordeal. 'His excuse was that he could no longer face the perceived 'disrespect' shown to him by these women. 'I am pleased he at least admitted his crimes and will now serve a lengthy sentence behind bars.'","Desmond Brooks, 42, stabbed his estranged wife to death in July 2013 .

"A mother-of-three slit her own throat in the middle of a supermarket after suffering a breakdown following the death of her daughter who she was convinced was the victim of black magic, an inquest has heard. Sobia Yousef, 36, died after grabbing a knife from the shelf of her local Asda store in Shipley, West Yorkshire, before plunging it into her throat in front of horrified shoppers. Bradford Coroner's Court was told that on the morning of her death Mrs Yousef sent her two surviving children to school before leaving the house for the shop. Sobia Yousef, 36, died after grabbing a knife from the shelf of her local Asda store in Shipley, West Yorkshire, before plunging it into her throat in front of horrified shoppers. Mrs Yousef with her three children, including her late daughter Meweesh, nine, right . She arrived at Asda at around 8.35am before heading to the aisle, taking the knife and killing herself, the inquest was told. The mother had been suffering from severe depression and psychotic episodes after her daughter Meweesh Mahmood was taken to hospital with severe complications resulting from a congenital heart defect in July 2013. The inquest was told that Mrs Mahmood believed that black magic had been used on the little girl and had alarmed staff at Leeds General Infirmary by claiming she could see cats in the room and had calling out to God to save her daughter. By the end of July Mrs Yousef had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act after she was diagnosed with severe depression with psychotic elements. She arrived at Asda at around 8.35am before heading to the aisle, taking the knife and killing herself, the inquest was told . The mother had been suffering from severe depression and psychotic episodes after her daughter Meweesh Mahmood was taken to hospital with severe complications resulting from a congenital heart defect in July 2013 . In an emotional statement to the court Mrs Yousef's brother Imitaz Ali said he his sister had made a number of strange and irrational decisions during the course of her illness. He said: 'My sister was doing things that were very unusual. She took all her jewellery and put it in a handkerchief, tied it together and threw it into a mosque letterbox. 'At the time the mosque was closed and so her aunties had to go find the man with the key to get it back. In an emotional statement to the court Mrs Yousef's brother Imitaz Ali (pictured today) said he his sister had made a number of strange and irrational decisions during the course of her illness .

'Sobia would stand out in the rain for hours and we were worried that she might hurt herself accidentally.' Mr Ali said that after Meweesh's death Mrs Yousef took all her daughter's clothes out of the wardrobe, piled them on the cooker and turned all the hobs on. Her husband Tariq Mahmood, who was sleeping upstairs at the time, smelt the smoke and came downstairs to find them on fire, before managing to fling the burning clothes out into the garden. Mr Ali said while her daughter was still in hospital Mrs Yousef cut all the electric wires to the boiler in her home because Meweesh had told her that she was too hot in her hospital bed. Mr Ali described his battle with health workers to get Mrs Yousef the support she needed. 'I spoke to doctors and support workers at Lynfield Mount Hospital who said it wasn't their problem because she had been discharged. 'One support worker who took her to the park said she was improving, but she was not improving, she was getting worse. 'Everybody who lived in the street knew she was poorly.

"A 71-year-old Seattle missionary abducted last month from a school in Nigeria has been released and is safe, the Free Methodist Church USA said Friday. In a statement on the church website, Bishop David Kendall said the Reverend Phyllis Sortor was released Friday evening, Nigeria time, 'into the care of authorities and Free Methodist Church leaders'. Armed men abducted her on February 23 from the Hope Academy compound in Emiworo, Kogi state. Scroll down for video . Phyllis Sortor, 71, was abducted on February 23 from a Christian school in Nigeria. She was released on Friday and is safe . Masked gunman raided a Christian school and fired sporadically to scare people away before taking Sortor hostage . 'We are deeply grateful to all who prayed for Phyllis' safe return and praise God the family representative was able to secure her release,' Kendall said in his statement. He provided no details about how the release was arranged. 'As a matter of sound policy, and to help protect the many, many people who helped secure Phyllis' freedom, we will have no comment concerning the efforts that were undertaken to secure her release,' the bishop said. Kogi State police said shortly after the abduction that the men who took Sortor had demanded a ransom of nearly $300,000. Police said they were collaborating with security forces to secure her return. Friends described Sortor as courageous, tenacious and passionate about helping the people of Nigeria and said she was aware of the dangers. Sortor has been working as a missionary  for ten years. Her friends say she was passionate about helping people in Nigeria and aware of the dangers of working there . She had spent years living in Africa, including Mozambique - where she spent much of her childhood - later working in Rwanda and, since 2005, Nigeria, Kendall said . Her work in Kogi was focused primarily on educational development and conflict resolution between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities who frequently clash in central Nigeria's Middle Belt region, the church statement further said. Foreign nationals have often been kidnapped in Nigeria by local gangs who typically release hostages following a ransom payment. Such abductions are especially common in the southern, oil-producing Niger Delta, where expatriates working with large oil companies have been a frequent target. A number of foreigners have also been kidnapped in the north of the country, but those attacks claimed by Boko Haram or the associated Islamist group Ansaru are considered a different phenomenon, and not necessarily motivated by a desire for ransom. Boko Haram has been blamed for previous attacks in Kogi, including two raids targeting the same prison in 2012 and 2014. Nigeria's Islamists groups have in the past publicly claimed the abduction of expatriates and the lack of such a claim following Sortor's kidnapping led many to believe that Boko Haram and its affiliates were not involved.","Masked gunman raided a Christian school and fired sporadically to scare people away before taking Phyllis Sortor hostage on February 23 .

"The US government has made a bizarre internet gaffe by posting a British Muslim extremist’s photograph of veiled women calling for sharia law, citing it as an inspirational example of free speech in the West. The American State Department’s ‘Think Again Turn Away’ campaign is designed to dissuade Muslims from joining IS – also known as ISIS – and other extreme groups. The campaign posted the picture on its Twitter account last week, adding: ‘In open societies, all faiths enjoy freedom of speech; under ISIS rule, no such thing as freedom of expression.’ Scroll down for video . The photograph shows Muslim women, all in black burkas, running a campaign stall in Dalston, East London . The photograph shows Muslim women, all in black burkas, running a stall in Dalston, East London. They are standing behind a trestle table covered in leaflets and a banner reading: ‘Shariah law or man made law. Which is better for mankind?’ An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has found the banner was used in an extremist campaign called Stay Muslim, Don’t Vote, which calls for strict sharia law to be imposed on Britain, as well as urging Muslims not to vote in elections. The photo was given the caption ‘Muslims coming out inviting society to Islam’ – which was copied by the US State Department – by a man calling himself Abdulrahman Muhajir, whose Twitter account is suspended. Blunder: Moshiur Rahman, who posted the image online, was one of 12 Islamists given Asbos banning them from taking part in demonstrations . The Mail on Sunday can reveal he is Moshiur Rahman, a 33-year-old from Luton, who last year was one of 12 Islamists given Asbos banning them from taking part in demonstrations over a violent protest rally on Oxford Street. At least two of the gang are believed to be fighting for IS in Syria. Anjem Choudary – the hate preacher who has repeatedly blamed British foreign policy for terrorist attacks and whose al-Muhajiroun group was banned by the Government – was present at the event in Dalston on March 7. He has also given talks in Walthamstow and East Ham at demonstrations where the sign was used. The photo appropriated by the US State Department was first placed on Twitter last week by a woman calling herself Umm Usmaan, who is a leading figure in the anti-democracy campaign. She described it as an ‘Islamic roadshow’ and included the slogan ‘stay Muslim, don’t vote’ when she put the photo on Twitter. Yesterday she posted a picture of another sign with the message: ‘The right of legislation belongs to none but Allah!’ Last night, terror expert Douglas Murray, associate director of the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said: ‘It’s an incredibly weak “fail”,’ he said. ‘They should be putting a bit more thought into their sourcing. With all of our resources, it’s not even as accomplished as the crudest IS propaganda.’ US Twitter users were also quick to ridicule the State Department, with one calling it an ‘epic fail’. Conservative US commentator Mark Steyn added: ‘Why is the State Department promoting sharia for the United Kingdom? Aren’t they supposed to uphold the Constitution of the United States? Sharia’s incompatible with that constitution, as it is with the legal inheritance of Western civilisation.’ The State Department did not respond to requests to comment yesterday.","US government posted a British Muslim extremist's photograph online .

"A headteacher allegedly set up a threesome with a prostitute who he wanted to spank while she was dressed as a schoolgirl. David Nicholson, 48, sent the woman explicit messages saying he was ‘keen’ on her dressing up like a pupil and was ‘looking forward to putting you over my knee’, it is claimed. The married father-of-four is under investigation after apparently using his school email address to contact an £150-an-hour escort through an adult website and arrange a meeting with her and another woman. Headteacher David Nicholson is accused of sending messages to a prostitute about spanking her when she is dressed up in school uniform as he allegedly organised a threesome with her and another woman . When one of them replied telling him she liked dressing up as a schoolgirl and being spanked, he allegedly responded: ‘I love this and would be keen.’ Mr Nicholson, who is headteacher of the 1,000-pupil Costello School in Basingstoke, Hampshire, allegedly organised a liaison in a hotel room on a night when he was due to be working away from home. However, he was forced to call off the plan when the meeting he was using as a cover was cancelled. He promised to stay in touch with the women to set up a new date, it is claimed. Governors at the academy school last night said they were investigating the allegations in The Sun newspaper. Mr Nicholson denies the claims. Yesterday, the two prostitutes said they were shocked to discover what he did for a living. One of the women, aged 20, told The Sun: ‘He is a head and his fetish is spanking girls dressed in school uniforms, that’s quite scary. In his position he should be trusted.’ The other woman said: ‘If I had kids I wouldn’t want them to go to that school to be honest. What sort of family man is he? He should set an example.’ Mr Nicholson, who is training to be an Ofsted inspector, presents an image of himself as a loving and trustworthy man in postings on social media. Mr Nicholson has worked as headteacher at The Costello School in Basingstoke since September last year . He lives with his wife 15 years Karina, 43, a local councillor, and their children in the Wiltshire village of Great Bedwyn, which is surrounded by stunning countryside. The Cambridge graduate moved to the Costello School last September, having previously worked as deputy and then headteacher at Abbeyfield School in Chippenham, Wiltshire. Mr Nicholson is accused of sending messages to one of the escorts, showing his enthusiasm for one of them dressing up in school uniform and being spanked. He used his school email to send the imessages . On his Twitter account he describes himself as a ‘husband and father’. In pictures posted online he is shown on his wedding day in July 2000 posing with Mrs Nicholson outside a local church before riding off from the service on a tandem bicycle. After the prostitutes’ claims were published yesterday, Mr Nicholson said he was ‘mortified’ by the situation. Governors at the Costello School said they had asked Mr Nicholson to leave the school site ‘immediately’ after allegations about his conduct surfaced. It was not clear if he had been officially suspended, but he will apparently not be allowed to return while an investigation is carried out. Another member of staff has taken on the role of acting headteacher. Carol Bode, the chairman of the school’s board of governors, said: ‘I can assure you all that we are taking matters very seriously. We are following all necessary and correct procedures and as previously mentioned a full investigation is being undertaken by the governing body. ‘Our first priority at this time is for our students and their continuing education.’ But she refused to comment on whether the teacher would be given full pay or whether the school had paid for the hotel room he allegedly intended to use for a threesome. Yesterday no one was available for comment at Mr and Mrs Nicholson’s £225,000 semi-detached home. Mr Nicholson told The Sun: ‘I’m mortified by the allegations. I am disputing them. Until I know the full details of what is alleged I can’t comment further.’","David Nicholson is the head teacher at Costello School in Basingstoke .

"A drug smuggler was caught carrying £180,000 of cocaine stuffed in her huge 46D bra. Nola Williams, 47, was found with the stash after she arrived at Gatwick on a BA flight from Kingston, Jamaica, with a child and accomplice Raymond Goodison in January last year. But despite being on licence for a previous jail sentence for drugs, Goodison was bailed and has since fled the country. Busted: Williams stashed a 1kg of high purity cocaine in her 46D bra - worth almost £200,000 at street value . Drug smugglers: Nola Williams (left) was found with 1kg of cocaine stuffed in her bra after arriving at Gatwick Airport. Her accomplice Raymond Goodison (right) fled the UK after being bailed . The pair were arrested as they boarded a train from the airport to Victoria station in central London. A strip search revealed a kilogram of cocaine stitched into the cups of Williams' bra. Goodison had used the woman as a 'mule' the court heard, as he was sentenced to 13 years in his absence. It is believed that he may now be in Jamaica or the US. He was convicted of smuggling cocaine while Williams pleaded guilty to the same charge. Judge Jeffery Blackett, sentencing Goodison at Croydon Crown Court, said: 'This man Raymond Goodison was, effectively, charged with importing over a kilo of cocaine into this country. 'He used Miss Williams, there's no doubt about that, so she could sew the drugs into her bra. 'She came through customs, with a child and then the offence was discovered.' He continued: 'There's no doubt I can infer, that he played a leading role in this drug importation. Defence: Williams claims she is not a drug smuggler but a victim of human trafficking and is yet to be sentenced. Above, the cocaine found in her bra . 'He was convicted before and he was sentenced to ten years for a similar offence and he recently had been involved in the supply of drugs. 'He was a man who was said to be unemployed but had significant assets.' He added that the money would have come from drug dealing. Williams, of Stockwell, south London, was also due to be sentenced. However, her barrister insisted that she had been a victim of human trafficking, so the judge adjourned her sentencing to allow more evidence to be gathered about the claims. Sentencing Goodison, Judge Blackett continued: 'He was on license for his most recent drugs offence, the drugs were of high purity and he was using Miss Williams, whatever her status, as a mule. 'She was with a child when she came through Gatwick.' He continued: 'The prosecution are correct to say there is no mitigation for this offence.' During Goodison's trial, prosecutor Louis French said: 'The amount we are talking about is nearly a kilo of quite high quality, about 71 per cent purity and that 973g would, if it were sold on the street, would be worth about £180,000. Williams was able to get through customs with the drugs stuffed in her bra (as seen above) but was arrested as she attempted to board a train from Gatwick Airport . Seized: The 46D bra was also stuffed with foam padding. The cocaine was stored in plastic bags in each cup . 'How was it smuggled in? It was concealed about the clothing of a woman who had arrived from Jamaica, more precisely Kingston, in the Caribbean, which is close to South America. 'That woman, who is Nola Williams, and she travel to this country through Gatwick Airport and had with her a young child.' When they arrived Williams and Goodison went into the baggage reclaim area separately and only spoke to each other on the shuttle from the North Terminal to the South Terminal. They were both arrested by officers from the National Crime Agency as they went through the ticket to barrier to board a Gatwick Express train to Victoria Station. Mr French said: 'While she was being searched by an officer, the stash of cocaine was detected, concealed in the bra, stitched in the cups of her garment.' Goodison claimed to have met Williams at Kingston Airport and denied flying together. However, analysis of their phones shows they were in regular contact in the UK in December 2013 before the flight back from Jamaica. The pair were arrested as they boarded a Gatwick Express train to Victoria Station in London, pictured above . In a statement forensic scientist, Fraser Johnson, said he was asked to examine 'a size 46 D bra, which weighed 1,142g.' He added: 'Inside the bra there were two plastic bags in each cup, and those plastic bags held a white powder which was found to be cocaine.' Goodison, of Northolt, Middlesex, has previous convictions for importing 637g of cocaine in 1991 when he sentenced to ten years and possession with intent to supply heroin in 2009 when he was jailed for five years. He was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in his absence. The judge also ordered that the drugs be forfeited and destroyed and ordered Goodison to pay a £120 victim surcharge. Describing William's claims that she was a victim of human trafficking, prosecutor Sean Sullivan said: 'Her representatives have conversed with the prosecution and the Home Office on the issue that she may be a victim of human trafficking.' He added that an officer from the Home Office had looked into the claim but added, ' [He] came to the conclusion that Miss Williams is not a victim of human trafficking.' However, he added: 'The situation appears to be this - the defence do not accept that finding at present and wish to obtain expert assistance in dealing with that issue.' Adjourning her sentencing to a date to be set, Judge Blackett said: 'I'm not going to sentence you today because inquiries need to be made into your assertion that you have been subjected to human trafficking.'","Nola Williams, 47, found with stash after arriving at Gatwick from Jamaica .

"Raffaele Sollecito today described his murder acquittal as a 'rebirth' but said his 'heart and soul will be marked for life' after being accused of killing British student Meredith Kercher. Mr Sollecito, 31, also said the new, final ruling will allow him to move on from his past, and his association with ex-girlfriend Amanda Knox. He said he now wants to be 'detached' from the 27-year-old American. The Italian and his ex-lover were both sensationally cleared on Friday, bringing an end to a see-sawing legal process which spanned more than seven years and saw them both serve four years in prison. Scroll down for video . Raffaele Sollecito (centre) speaks during a press conference in Rome flanked by his lawyers Giulia Bongiorno (left) and Luca Maori after he was acquitted last week of murdering British student Meredith Kercher . Raffaele Sollecito (right) flanked by his lawyer Giulia Bongiorno, talks to the media during a press conference in Rome. He described the ruling as an 'end to the nightmare' Speaking to NBC's Today show after the ruling, Sollecito said that having his brief relationship with Knox played out repeatedly in public had scarred him. He said: 'All the people talking about my relationship with her took me psychologically down, I don't want it. 'I just want to be detached from this kind of bond.' When asked about his feelings towards Miss Knox, whom he has not spoken to in around a year, Mr Sollecito said: 'I'm very happy for her - I really believe in her innocence. I believe now justice has been done.' When asked whether the two would ever meet again, he said that it was too soon to say. Speaking later at a press conference in Rome, Mr Sollecito described the ruling as an 'end to the nightmare'. He spent four years in prison before being freed in 2011, said he wanted to get back to his old life after enduring over seven years of 'a kind of pain without an end'. 'Air of freedom': Sollecito told NBC's Kelly Cobiella, left, that he is looking forward to moving on with his life, and his indelible association with Miss Knox . He added: 'My heart and soul will be marked for life. This wound will never stop bleeding, it will never heal. 'I have got an infinite list of horrible moments. Seven years and five months is an incredibly long time when you're suffering, when you're living an unbearable tragedy.' Mr Sollecito, who was originally convicted with his then girlfriend Miss Knox, explained how a call from his sister late on Friday night provided the news he had been hoping for. He said: 'The most beautiful moment without a doubt was the one that put an end to the nightmare, the call from my sister after the reading of the sentence and the total acquittal from the High Court.' He said: 'I feel today as though I am a prisoner who after seven years and five months has found freedom again. 'I am coming back to the life which I hope will be my life from now on, coming back to my normal existence, to live like a boy of my age without having to have any worries anymore.' Arline Kercher, Meredith's mother, described the ruling on Friday night as 'odd'. She said: '(I am) a bit surprised, and very shocked, but that is about it at the moment. 'They have been convicted twice so it's a bit odd that it should change now.' Amanda Knox vowed to return to Italy just two days after being cleared of murdering British student Meredith Kercher. She is pictured (left) speaking after Friday's decision and (right) after her initial acquittal in 2011 . Her daughter, who was 21 and from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy. Miss Knox told reporters outside her family home in Seattle on the day of the verdict that she was 'full of joy'. 'Right now I'm still absorbing what all this means and what comes to mind is my gratitude for the life that's been given to me,' she said. Miss Knox, 27, who was Ms Kercher's flat-mate and a student from Seattle, and Mr Sollecito, spent four years in jail for the murder but were acquitted on appeal in 2011. Miss Knox returned to the U.S. before an appeal court threw out the acquittal and reinstated her and Mr Sollecito's guilty verdicts last year. But Italy's highest court on Friday overturned last year's convictions and declined to order another trial. Yesterday, it emerged that Miss Knox could receive millions in compensation after being cleared. Knox, who served four years in prison after being convicted of the murder of Kercher (left) alongside ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (right) in 2007, 'loves' Italy, her lawyer said . Two days after being acquitted, she vowed to return to Italy - just two days after being cleared of murdering the British woman while living in the country. It is also understood that Knox - who was reportedly paid £2.7million ($4million) for her 2013 book Waiting to Be Heard - will write about the country's judicial system while she is there. Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Carlo Dalla Vedova, her Italian lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Mr Sollecito's father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' Mr Dalla Vedova added Miss Knox will go back to Italy after spending some time with her family in America. 'She loves Italy. She always says she wants to come back,' The Sunday Times reported Mr Dalla Vedova as saying. 'Certainly she will be back in Italy, she always liked Italy, that's why she came here.' A view of the house where British student Kercher was killed. It is understood Knox will go back to Italy to write a book about the country's legal system . Knox and Sollecito were pictured embracing as police searched the house immediately after Kercher's death . Knox breaks down in tears after hearing the verdict that overturned her original conviction and acquitted her in October 2011 . Mr Vedova was speaking after Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, now 31, were cleared of murdering her former roommate. The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation is the final ruling in the seven-year case and definitively ends the gruelling legal battle. The pair always maintained their innocence. Shortly after the verdict, Knox, who previously said she would never willingly return to Italy, released a statement. It said she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal'. She added: 'Throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, friends and strangers. To them, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me.' Sollecito discovered his conviction had been overturned when his lawyer called him from outside court with the news, exclaiming: 'You have your whole life ahead of you now, Raf.' Both Sollecito and Knox were imprisoned shortly after Kercher's body was discovered with 47 separate wounds on November 1, 2007. Knox talks on her mobile phone from her mother's Seattle home just moments after hearing Friday's news. After the verdict she said she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal' They were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively. But after they served four years in prison a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent. Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years. Judge Gennaro Marasca read the decision to finally acquit the pair on Friday after a judicial body had deliberated for ten hours. It was met with stunned silence. The pair could now seek compensation. Although the amount is not known it could reach up to seven figures. Rudy Guede is now the only person to be successfully convicted of the murder. The unemployed basketball player was found guilty in October 2008 and was convicted to 16 years after his footprints were discovered in Kercher's blood. The court will publish its reasons for Friday's decision within 90 days.","Italian, 31, says acquittal by judges last week brings 'end to the nightmare'

"Producers working on the remake of the Oscar-winning Ben Hur have been barred from shooting the epic chariot scene at the Circus Maximus. Filmmakers already on location in Rome and the southern city of Matera reportedly made a request to use the ancient stadium immortalised by the film in December. But it was feared the decision to bring hundreds of extras and heavy vehicles into a fragile archaeological site would lead to public outcry. The Circus Maximus (pictured) is an ancient site in Rome once used for the empire's deadly chariot races. Here it is pictured when it hosted the Live 8 concert in 2005 . The Circus Maximus was capable of holding hundreds of thousands of spectators during the chariot races . However, archaeologists said filming at the ancient site would cause 'irreparable damage' to the famous site . The rent of the ancient ground as a set for two weeks would have netted one million euros for the city’s cash-strapped coffers, Corriere della Sera reported. The classic chariot race scene - in which Ben Hur played by Charlton Heston competes against his nemesis Massala - will now be filmed in a purpose-built reproduction arena in Rome’s Cinecittà studios. The Circus Maximus was the centre of a row last summer when the Rolling Stones were allowed to use it for a concert. Heritage experts said the decision to allow 65,000 music fans to rampage over the area would cause irreparable damage to a ‘very fragile’ site. The millionaire rock band were charged just €8,000. The original 1959 Ben Hur film saw Charlton Heston filmed at the Circus Maximus in the movie's epic chariot race finale (pictured) The ancient arena has been used for pop concerts in the past with Genesis and Lady Gaga playing there in recent years. Bob Geldof's Live 8 concert was held there in 2005. But the site is currently under restoration. Archeologists have continued to discover Roman artefacts including ancient coins, wheels and saucepans as well as the remains of ancient taverns. A spokesman for the Ministry for Cultural Affairs said it was investigating.","Film producers have been barred from filming at the famed Circus Maximus .

"A student was booted off a Southwest Airlines flight during a stopover because he refused to take off a shirt emblazoned with the F-word.

Controversial: Daniel Podolsky was thrown off a flight to Chicago for wearing the above Comedy Central shirt, which he was given at the trendy South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas . His quarrel with staff came when bad weather in Chicago forced the plane to pause at Lambert airport in St Louis, Missouri, Fox2 News reported. Until this point he had been wearing a jacket, but he took it off. When he went to get back on, the gate attendant challenged him. Podolsky cited his 'freedom of speech', but was told he would be breaching Southwest's rules by wearing an offensive shirt, so couldn't get on. He refused to back down, and was left behind as the flight soared off to Illinois. Denied: First a Southwest Airlines member of staff, left, then a member of his flight's cabin crew, right. told him he couldn't get back on while wearing the shirt . Podolsky then got in touch with Fox to tell them his story, and handed over video footage of the exchange. He told the station: 'It just happened so fast. Within thirty seconds the flight was gone.' When asked whether he considered covering up, or taking the shirt off, he replied: 'I mean I would have gladly done so.' However, his own cell phone video shows him being asked first to change the shirt, then to turn it inside-out, and lastly to do 'anything' not to display the shirt. Each time he answers 'nope'. He was later allowed to board a flight to New York, his ultimate destination, after changing his shirt.

"A woman who was arrested on an American Airlines flight after lighting a cigarette, blaming somebody else then ranting about Obama can be revealed as a Penn State professor of sociology. Dr Karen Halnon, 52, who wrote her PhD thesis on hysterical women, was arrested on board the plane for disorderly conduct as it sat on the tarmac at Miami International Airport on Saturday. She was caught on camera lighting up shortly after the flight had landed - but stubbed it out and thrust the butt into a seat pocket when flight attendants came over. She's an expert: Dr Karen Halnon, left in her police mugshot and right in a faculty photo, is an associate in sociology at a Penn State campus . She then pointed at the man in a seat next to her when challenged over her behavior - before launching into a pro-communist rant attacking the United States for applying economic sanctions on Venezuela. According to NBC, police were called aboard the flight, which had come from Nicaragua, and tried to calm her down, but were met with the response: 'F*** you. This is not a democracy'. She was arrested for disorderly conduct and jailed at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. A statement from Penn State on Tuesday confirmed that Halnon is a member of staff. It said: 'Penn State Abington is aware of Dr. Karen Halnon’s behavior this past weekend on a flight from Nicaragua and is looking into the matter.' She teaches sociology at the school's Abington campus near Philadelphia, and has the rank of associate professor. According to her faculty page she is an expert on capitalism, Latin America and mad women. Smoking: Halnon is seen smoking on board the flight, in a video uploaded to Youtube and posted on Reddit . Wasn't me: When fellow flyers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior, Halnon blamed someone else for smoking and went on a bizarre rant . Dr Halnon was award her PhD from Boston College in 1995 with a thesis about treatments for women and hysteria. She has two published books, and more than 25 journal articles to her name. In her political rant about the flight she explored her political beliefs, equating the United States's tough economic sanctions against Venezuela with a declaration of war. She also cited Hugo Chavez as a 'hero' of hers, and allegedly said that Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays'. She shouted: 'The United States has declared war on Venezuela. Venezuela has been declared a national security threat.' 'You're a national security threat,' a passenger remarked off camera. 'She's gangster' another passenger said laughing. Flight attendants warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down, according to The Daily Dot. So she yelled louder. She ranted: 'Venezuela previously owned the oil in Venezuela. My great hero Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people with all of the oil...not Exon Mobil would go away!' Bizarrely, she shouted: 'The people own the oil.' According to an eyewitness, the woman added that U.S. President Barack Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays.' After another warning by a flight attendant the woman protested: 'I know already the [police are coming to take me off the aircraft.] But before I'm arrested I'm going to say my peace. 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. Her illegal deed was caught on camera by a flyer who then posted the video  to YouTube and website Reddit. The redditor, with the user name 'upside down dog,' alleged that he was on the same flight as the woman when he recorded her. Calm down: A flight attendant, right, warned Halnon that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. They were . Rant: 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. He  wrote: 'While the plane was waiting on the tarmac for the police to arrive, she leans over to me and asks for a cigarette. 'She pulls one out of her bag and lights up. This is the point where I pull eject and run to the back of the cabin. The police arrive after 20 minutes and escort her off the plane. 'She only had a single drink on the plane (however, others told me she was pounding them back pretty hard in the terminal and she also was on prescription painkillers). 'The irony is that this sociology professor is focused mainly on women’s hysteria. Due to this, Customs was closed just long enough that me and most others on that flight missed our connection. Smoking has been strictly prohibited on almost all airlines since 1988.

"Mystery surrounds the legacy of Cubs' legend Ernie Banks who apparently only left $16,000 worth of assets when he died in January aged 83. The news emerged as the star player's estranged fourth wife Elizabeth Banks and glamorous caretaker Regina Rice pursue a bitter court battle to seize the estate. Rice has been accused of coercing the baseball great into signing a will that left everything to her, without his family's knowledge. Meanwhile, the Chicago Cubs has agreed to settle the allegedly unpaid bill - totalling $35,000 - for Banks' burial service after a funeral home sued the family for all costs plus legal fees. Missing millions? Ernie Banks, one of the greats of baseball, reportedly only left $16,000 when he died at 83 . Bitter battle: His widow Elizabeth Banks (left) and his caregiver Regina Rice (right) are fighting for the estate . And Rice maintains that Banks had wanted to be cremated, with his ashes scattered over Wrigley Field. Lawyers for Banks' widow, Elizabeth, have called for a review of the player's accounts including vehicles and baseball memorabilia after Rice's lawyers estimated him to be worth $16,000. Last month, Cook County Court heard Banks was never paid more than $75,000 a year throughout his lengthy and high-flying career. However, Rice's attorney Linda Chatman said the estimate was just preliminary, and she noted that the true value of the estate was in the rights to his name and likeness. That means that the estate could be worth far more, given Ernie Banks' place in the history of Major League Baseball and in Chicago, where he was a beloved sports figure for his 19 years on the field and decades after. Rice has been barred from selling anything that belonged to Banks as his widow and two sons contest the latest will. Heightening tensions, a law suit filed this week by Donnellan Family Funeral Services claims the Banks family did not pay $11,000 for the cost of the casket, $6,755 for flowers, more than $3,000 in car services and $2,700 in staff fees. 'I find it quite interesting that she did not tell anyone that she had an attorney write up a new will,' one of Banks' twin sons, Jerry Banks, said. A court heard Banks was never paid more than $75,000 a year for his lengthy and stellar career with the Cubs . Rice responded in a statement that Banks trusted her to carry out his wishes, some of which were during his lifetime and others after his life, and made her promise to adhere to them. Joey Banks said the family thought Rice was helping and watching over 'Mr Cub' while he was in Chicago. Family attorney Mark Bogen said that only after the funeral did the Banks family became aware he had signed a new will during his illness. A provision of the will, signed and dated on October 17, said: 'I am making no provisions under this will for wife or my children, not for a lack of love and affection for them and for reasons best known to them.' Bogen said the family will vigorously fight the will. 'It is understandable that Ernie's family is concerned at this very sad time,' Rice said in her statement. 'However, the record, and those closest to Ernie, will dispel any iota of concern regarding my relationship with Ernie and his trust in me to carry out his wishes.' Contention: Banks' twin sons, Joey and Jerry Banks, pictured at their father's memorial service, are also contending the will that leaves the estate to Rice. They accuse Rice of coercing Banks to sign the document . Rice went on to say she will not participate in any verbal jousting with Banks' family or do anything to tarnish his legacy. Before Banks' death, family members frequently spoke to Rice because she made it difficult for them to speak directly to him, Jerry Banks said. 'At the funeral of my father, I went out of my way to praise Ms Rice and her son for helping my father,' Joey Banks said. 'What I did not know at that time is that for at least six months prior to my father's death, in my opinion, she was using him, manipulating him and controlled him.' The brothers' comments were their first in a dispute that first centered on what should be done with Ernie Banks' remains. Estranged wife Elizabeth Banks went to court to prevent Rice from having Banks' remains cremated. Rice wanted Banks' remains to be cremated after his death last month at the age of 83, according to documents filed by Elizabeth Banks' attorneys on February 2. He was buried later last month at Graceland Cemetery.","Chicago Cubs great never earned more than $75,000 a year, court heard .

"Porsche have hit back at a lawsuit claiming negligence and poor design caused the 2013 crash that killed Paul Walker, saying the sole cause of the accident was  the dangerous driving of the man behind the wheel, Roger Rodas. The luxury car-maker is demanding the lawsuit, which was filed by Kristine Rodas - the widow of Roger Rodas - be thrown out of court. Mrs Rodas filed the suit last year, claiming the $500,000 red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT her husband was driving, along with Walker as passenger, had a faulty suspension. She claimed Rodas tried to keep the car on the road, but could not regain control. She also claimed that a 'properly functioning crash cage' would have prevented the deaths. Scroll down for video .

The car crashed into a concrete lamppost and two trees in Valencia, California, on November 30, 2013, killing both Rodas and Walker. Mrs Rodas also blames Porsche for the car exploding on impact, claiming the vehicle lacked a proper 'crash cage' and a 'racing fuel cell.' Furthermore, she accused Porsche of ignoring multiple fatal crashes that occurred in the model and never took steps to warn their customers.

"The British are happier than the French but more miserable than the Irish, an EU league table of happiness revealed yesterday. It found that we are on a par with the Germans when we measure our satisfaction with life, and much more cheerful than those worst hit by the euro crisis, including Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. Scandinavian countries ranked happiest, according to the table compiled by Eurostat, the EU’s statistics arm. The British are happier than the French but more miserable than the Irish, an EU league table of happiness revealed yesterday . It was put out to mark today’s International Day of Happiness established by the UN and was based on answers to the question: ‘Overall, how satisfied are you with your life these days?’ Britons scored 7.3 out of ten – compared to a European average of 7.1 – but the Danes, Finns and Swedes all recorded an average satisfaction level of eight. In Britain, the results of the surveys have shown that married people are happier than cohabitees or single people; that young people and the newly retired are happier than the squeezed middle-aged; and that we worry more about our health than most of the rest of the EU. They have also suggested that better-off people are happier than those who are poor. Ireland scored 7.4 to just pip Britain while the people of economically stagnant France rated seven. The Mediterranean countries came even lower, while Bulgarians were bottom of the table, recording a miserable 4.8. The happiness league follows the introduction by Brussels of life satisfaction surveys which are carried out by national statistics ministries across the continent. Britain has been measuring the happiness of the population since 2010, when David Cameron backed the idea, saying it was as important to know about people’s well-being as to publish economic figures. The British surveys are costing taxpayers £2 million a year. Eurostat said yesterday: ‘Life satisfaction is a multi-dimensional concept, which is very much shaped by various socio-demographic factors which lead to different living situations as well as to different expectations and preferences.’ It said that broadly men and women were equally happy, and health was more important to people than money, work or friends.","British are happier than the French according to an EU table of happiness .

"PC Christopher Higgs was in relationships with four women between 2009 and 2012 and defrauded them of  £38,307 in order to fund his gambling addiction . A police officer has been jailed after he defrauded four vulnerable women out of tens of thousands of pounds in order to fund his gambling addiction. PC Christopher Higgs, 30, of Helston, Cornwall, was in relationships with four different women between 2009 and 2012 and defrauded them of a total of £38,307. Plymouth Crown Court heard that the women 'fell foul of his charms' and when that did not work on them he 'cajoled them or threatened them'. During the course of his relationships with his victims Higgs, a father-of-one,  would tell them he had debts, either from previous relationships or in the form of household bills. He would emotionally blackmail them claiming to be depressed and suicidal at the pressure his debts were putting him under. Placing their trust in Higgs as a police officer his victims all agreed to lend him money. But when Higgs' lies started to unravel he began blackmailing his victims, the court heard. He told one that if she didn't lie to the police for him he would get social services involved in an ongoing family dispute she was having. One of his victims even took out loans from the bank on his behalf on the agreement that he would pay the monthly bills. Higgs defrauded his victims to fund his gambling addiction, which the court heard had cost him £163,640 to date. He has now been jailed for five years and two months after he admitted 16 counts of fraud, perverting the course of justice, intimidation and blackmail. During sentencing at Plymouth Crown Court yesterday Judge Paul Darlow described Higgs as 'a disgrace to the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary.' The Devon & Cornwall (headquarters pictured) police officer has been suspended from duties since 2013 . The victims each made statements in which they told of the horrendous effects suffered at his hands. One of them, a single mother, said he pressurised her daily into handing over money and 'begged and pleaded for money'. She said she was left 'unable to feed herself' and she was left 'on her hands and knees begging as Higgs laughed in her face' The court heard the women trusted Higgs (pictured) as an officer of Devon and Cornwall police force . She said it was 'a horrific nightmare he put me under'. Another victim  said she was manipulated and preyed on by Higgs and branded him 'scum' She said Higgs threatened suicide – and he even stole money from the victim's young son. In a victim impact statement read out in court, one woman said: 'I was in a vulnerable position when Chris Higgs lied to me. 'He abused his position as a police officer and a friend. I am now struggling to make ends meet because of the debt he left me in.' Jason Taylor, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Higgs clearly had a gambling problem, and to fund this he manipulated women. 'They fell foul of his charms and when that failed him he turned to intimidation and cajoling. 'Over the course of his relationships he applied psychological pressure in the form of saying he was suicidal.' Robert Linford, defending, said: 'He did not set out to befriend each of the complainants in order to defraud them. 'They were people for whom he had a genuine feeling of affection and for whom he wanted to be with. 'In the background Christopher Higgs had a secret addiction. To most of us who have never had an addiction, that word may sound like an excuse. 'This is no excuse for what he did, but it's the reason that lay behind his shameful years of offending. 'At the time the word of Christopher Higgs was only as good as his next bet.' Judge Paul Darlow told Higgs: 'Over a period of three years you defrauded single women who until they met you were financially independent. 'You got them to part with large sums of money they could ill afford to lose. Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) heard  Higgs was 'a disgrace to Devon and Cornwall Constabulary' 'They did not have much but it was their own. 'The fact it was used in gambling makes the matter worse. 'You are a disgrace to the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary.' Because he has no assets the judge made a nominal £1 confiscation order against Higgs, who was led away from the dock in handcuffs. Higgs, who served as a response police officer in the Helston area, has been suspended from duties since January 2013. He will now be subject to a fast track internal disciplinary process. Detective Superintendent Sam De Reya said: 'PC Higgs has acted in a wholly inappropriate and criminal manner for which he has rightly been convicted at court. 'As soon as these allegations came to light, PC Higgs was suspended and a full investigation launched which identified the victims and witnesses who have supported the investigation and criminal case. 'As a priority the Chief Constable of Devon & Cornwall Police will now oversee a special case hearing to complete the misconduct process and finalise PC Higg's current position as a police constable.' Det Supt De Reya added: 'Devon & Cornwall Police expects the highest ethical and professional conduct from all officers and staff operating within the force. 'PC Higgs' actions have fallen well below the standards expected on a number of occasions resulting in criminal offences being identified. 'The offences significantly impacted the victims who were members of the public, colleagues, family and friends and our thoughts and considerations are with them as PC Higgs begins his custodial sentence.'","PC Christopher Higgs, 30, defrauded four women of £38,307 in total .

"An elderly German man recently indicted on mass murder charges for his time spent at  Auschwitz in WW2 was on duty when Jewish diarist Anne Frank arrived. Hubert Zafke, now 94, was present when Anne came in on a train carrying 498 men, 442 women and 79 children from Holland's Westerbork concentration camp on September 5, 1944, prosecution documents released at the weekend show. Anne, whose memoir of a life in hiding from the Nazis became the single most poignant piece of Holocaust literature, was later transferred to the Belsen concentration camp in Germany where she died early in 1945. Only her father would survive the war. Hubert Zafke, now 94, is charged in the complicity of 3,681 murders. He was on duty when Jewish diarist Anne Frank arrived at Auschwitz (above) Zafke is now charged in the complicity of 3,681 murders - victims who were gassed or shot when he was on duty. Although classed as a medic, such personnel at Auschwitz were not concerned with the health of inmates, but often poured Zyklon-B pesticide crystals into the gas chamber to murder them. More than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were liquidated at Auschwitz. The indictment shows that Zafke, who now lives in the tiny village of Gnevkow north of Berlin, joined the Hitler Youth when he was a teenager in his hometown of Schoenau, which now lies in Poland. The son of a farmer, he attended high school and an agricultural college intending to follow in his father's footsteps. In 1933, aged 13, he joined the Hitler Youth and six years later was in the SS. He received his grounding in concentration camp training at Dachau, the first of the Nazi camps where 36,000 people were murdered during its 12-year operation. As a junior squad leader - a rank usually given to men singled out as future officer material - Zafke transferred to Auschwitz in the summer of 1944. He is charged with being an accomplice to the murders of the 3,681 victims between August 14 and September 14, 1944. Prosecutors said: 'He is not charged with any single specific murder but as a functionary in the Nazi murder machine which he enabled.' Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army on January 27, 1945, now World Holocaust Day, but Zafke had already gone west and fell into British hands. Anne (above) came in on a train carrying 498 men, 442 women and 79 children from Holland's Westerbork concentration camp on September 5, 1944, prosecution documents released at the weekend show . Prosecutors said Zafke, who transferred to Auschwitz (above) in the summer of 1944, 'is not charged with any single specific murder but as a functionary in the Nazi murder machine which he enabled' He was later transferred back to Poland where he was given a three year jail sentence in 1948 for his membership in the SS and service at Auschwitz. He returned to Germany, married and had four sons who be brought up in Gnevkow. He made a career out of manufacturing and selling agricultural products including pesticides. Gnevkow lay in former East Germany. When the wall fell and archives in Poland, East Germany and former Soviet Russia became accessible, he came on to the radar of Nazi hunters. The verdict against John Demnjanjuk, a former guard at the Sobibor death camp in occupied Poland, in 2011 paved the way for Zafke's prosecution. Demjanjuk was sentenced to five years in jail for his part in the murders of 28,000 Dutch Jews. It was the first time that there was not specific eyewitness evidence against an individual - the mere fact he was present in the camp was enough for a guilty verdict. Anne, whose memoir of a life in hiding from the Nazis became the single most poignant piece of Holocaust literature, was later transferred to the Belsen concentration camp in Germany where she died early in 1945 . Zafke does not deny his service at Auschwitz but claims: 'I heard nothing, saw nothing, killed no-one.' Although he lives alone and cares for himself, his lawyer has already filed a motion seeking to have the charges dropped, claiming he is suffering from dementia. Christoph Heubner, executive vice president of the International Auschwitz Committee, said: 'For the survivors of Auschwitz this is all about justice, not revenge. Justice has had to wait decades.' He added: 'Those perpetrators who ensured, as members of the SS, that the Auschwitz-Birkenau death factory worked smoothly, and that the Jewish families of Europe disappeared into the gas chambers, have developed no sense of awareness of wrongdoing over the years. 'Therefore these legal processes are first and foremost an inquiry to the Germans - who actually owns your compassion?'","Hubert Zafke was on duty when the train arrived on September 5, 1944 .

"A cloud of toxic smog blown across the channel from Europe has sent pollution levels in the UK soaring to dangerous levels and will continue plaguing the country into tomorrow. High pressure and little wind means the pollution is building up, and also means that the blanket of cloud which is currently covering much of the country will persist into Friday, blocking out the eclipse for most people. A Met Office spokesman said for most sky-gazers the only sign the eclipse is happening will be when light levels dip at around 9.30am. She added that there will be pockets of clear skies, but that it is difficult to predict where these will be. Meanwhile the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is advising the elderly, young and those with heart and lung conditions to avoid strenuous activity, especially outdoors, adding that those with asthma may also experience increased breathing problems. Scroll down for video . The Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs (Defra) is warning the elderly, children and those with heart and lung problems to avoid strenuous activity, especially outdoors (pictured, fog in Manchester this morning) Pollution blown across from Europe has settled across much of the UK today (left), sending levels of toxic particles soaring, and light winds mean it will remain for much of tomorrow (centre) before dissipating on Friday (right), though cloud will remain, blocking the eclipse . Asthmatics are also being told they may experience increased breathing difficulties after levels of pollutants reach level 9 out of a possible ten earlier today (pictured, Manchester this morning) High pressure which has settled over the UK will mean little change in the weather over the coming days, with cloud ruining any chance of seeing the eclipse on Friday for most of the country . Pollution blown across from Europe, where Paris is currently shrouded in smog, has sent levels of 'particulate matter' soaring to level nine out of a possible ten across much of the south west and London, while moderate to high levels were recorded across the midlands and parts of Scotland. A Defra spokesman said: 'Adults and children with heart or lung problems are at greater risk of symptoms. Follow your doctor's usual advice about exercising and managing your condition. 'It is possible that very sensitive individuals may experience health effects even on low air pollution days.' A Met Office spokesman added: 'Some individuals, such as those with existing heart or lung conditions, may experience increased symptoms. 'The Met Office is working very closely with Defra and Public Health England (PHE) to ensure they have the most up-to-date and accurate air quality forecasts in order to provide relevant advice to the public.' Kay Boycott, Chief Executive of Asthma UK, says: 'Two thirds of people with asthma find that air pollution makes their asthma worse, putting them at an increased risk of a potentially fatal asthma attack. 'When air pollution is high it’s vital people with respiratory conditions including asthma check air pollution forecasts, carry their reliever inhaler with them at all times, and ensure that they are taking their preventer inhaler every day because this will help build resilience to asthma triggers like air pollution. 'People with asthma have told us that on days when air pollution levels are high they feel that they can’t even leave the house for fear that it will trigger an attack.' London was badly affected by smog in April last year when high pollution levels from Europe combined with toxic particles from the UK and dust blown in from the Sahara to create a thick cloud that was visible across parts of the capital. Paris is currently shrouded in a thick layer of smog, and pollutants blown over from the continent have been causing problems in the UK . Last year authorities in Paris took the unprecedented step of banning cars from the road for a day in order to cut pollution levels . Settled weather conditions have allowed pollution levels to rocket, exceeding EU recommended limits by up to three times in some places (pictured, the Eiffel Tower is seen among the smog) An unusual combination of factors had conspired ""to create a 'perfect storm' for air pollution,' according to Helen Dacre, a meteorologist at the University of Reading. 'Toxic gases, such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone, as well as fine dust particles in the air blown in from the Sahara and from burning fossil fuels, all contribute to cause problems for people with heart, lung and breathing problems, such as asthma,' she said. Around the same time Paris took the unprecedented step of banning cars from the roads for a day in an effort to ease pollutant levels, which had reached dangerous levels. For the rest of this week the weather is set to stay mild, dry and predominantly cloudy for most of the UK over the next couple of days and into the weekend, as an area of high pressure persists. Nicola Maxey, a spokesman for the Met Office, said: 'Tomorrow is going to be similar to today with more cloud around, particularly for the North. There is a chance of showers in the South East and just a risk of some more showers later on for Scotland. London was badly affected by a 'perfect storm' of smog last year as local pollution, toxic particles from Europe and dust blown across from the Sahara combined to create dangerous conditions . Canary Wharf can just be made out amid a pall of smog that covered London in April last year leading to Defra putting out health warnings . 'There is going to be a weather front pushing in to the North West and areas of Scotland which may clear a little of the cloud. Elsewhere it will continue to be cloudy. If you catch a break in the cloud, like today, you will see some sunshine. 'It will be cloudy throughout Friday with a chance of some breaks, though it is too early to say exactly where they might be. 'Saturday there will still be cloud around with temperatures dropping because we have got air moving in from the North, bringing them down to a little below average. It will be much the same on Sunday.'","Pollution covering Paris has been blown across channel and weak winds mean it has settled across the UK .
It will remain for much of tomorrow before new weather front will cause it to dissipate by Friday morning .

"Evidence: Police officer David Duckenfield today admitted that he was not qualified to oversee the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989 which ended in tragedy . The most senior police officer on duty during the Hillsborough disaster today apologised and admitted he was 'not the best man' for the task, adding that he was 'learning on the job'. Former chief superintendent David Duckenfield, the match commander, had little experience of policing football matches and had never been in charge during a game before. Giving evidence at the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans today, he said it was a 'serious mistake' not to consult with his predecessor about the challenges the match would pose, and apologised for 'failings' in the policing of the game. The supporters were crushed to death shortly after the start of the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground on April 15, 1989. Mr Duckenfield, now 70, was a chief superintendent who was promoted to be head of the local police division two weeks before the game. He gave the order to open the gates to the ground in the minutes before the crush, allowing 2,000 fans to flood into the ground, and later wrongly claimed that a gate had been forced open. Speaking at the inquest in Warrington, Cheshire today, Mr Duckenfield was asked whether he had any concerns about his ability to do the job properly given his lack of experience. The former officer replied: 'All I would say is this, that after a period, I would say, I'm older, hopefully wiser - probably I was not the best man for the job on the day.' Mr Duckenfield said he had no recent previous experience of policing at Hillsborough before the match and his knowledge of the stadium was 'very general.' Asked later how familiar he was with the ground, Mr Duckenfield said: 'With hindsight I can almost say, knowing the events of the day, I should've spent the majority of my time as the new commander down there. 'I did in the light of the information available what I considered necessary, and, if there was a failing, well, I apologise.' The officer agreed that while he had experience of public order policing, that was 'totally different' to policing football matches. He added: 'At the time I should have thought about my limited knowledge of the role of a commander at a major event that was a sell-out when I had not been in that responsible position previously.' Mr Duckenfield said that after first joining South Yorkshire Police as a cadet in 1960, he had been 'delighted' to be promoted to the post of chief superintendent of F Division of South Yorkshire Police - including Hillsborough - around March 1989. Inexperienced: Mr Duckenfield had only recently been promoted at the time of the match . Relatives: Campaigners Margaret Aspinall, left, and Jenni Hicks, right, pictured outside the inquest today . The witness told the jury the job came with other major responsibilities, as the area was also home to a major hospital, the local university and areas of affluence and deprivation. He said, while the semi-final game was 'obviously a major priority', it was only one of the priorities he had to deal with, adding: 'I only had 15 days, and that was not 15 working days.' Mr Duckenfield said his understanding of the job of the match commander was that he would not be involved in the day-to-day or minute-by-minute duties and would only become on the day if something went wrong. Christina Lambert QC asked him: 'Did it not occur to you before the match that it was a job that called for deep experience?' Mr Duckenfield said he had been 'assured' by his boss the chief constable he could rely on the other experienced officers in his team, though he had only had a single brief conversation with his predecessor, Brian Mole. Miss Lambert asked if he thought it was a mistake to accept the role and 'not seek the assistance from others such as Mr Mole?' He replied: 'There was a culture in the police service at that time and the culture was you would be moved without any overlap and you would learn, dare I say it, on the job. So it did not cross my mind to say, 'I'm not up to the job.' I just got on with it.' Miss Lambert continued: 'My question is, in hindsight, was it a mistake?' The witness replied: 'In hindsight, it was a serious mistake. I did know what the job involved, but no one, including me, knew what might evolve on the day.' Crush: 96 Liverpool fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground's perimeter fence . Mr Duckenfield said that it was necessary to keep rival fans apart from each other in order to ensure their safety, pointing to the culture of football hooliganism at the time. He said: 'The main objectives were safety and I align that with segregation, because if segregation was ensured, then safety usually followed, because of your planning. You can't separate the two.' Mr Duckenfield said he had experienced hooliganism while working as a inspector at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground, adding: 'It was a feature of matches in those days where people fought and argued for whatever reason. 'Those were the challenges that we were facing in the 1970s. It seemed to be very sadly the fact of life that fighting and hooliganism was the main feature of policing football matches.' Miss Lambert asked him about two pre-match meetings of police officers, dealing with planning ahead of the game. Mr Duckenfield said the first, on March 22, 1989, was chaired by his predecessor and he 'just sat there and listened'. He insisted that no minutes were taken of the meeting, and he was not given any notes after the event. Chaos: Fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster . Jurors also heard Mr Duckenfield intended to have a day-long 'one-to-one' briefing with Mr Mole before he took over from him as match commander for the 1989 semi-final. That meeting did not happen as he expected, said Mr Duckenfield, who had heard 'speculation and rumour' that Mr Mole was moved to another post after 'matters of indiscipline' within his division. He added: 'I went to see Mr Mole, expecting to have a whole day with him, and he seemed, shall we say, in my view, disappointed to be moving, wanting to clear his desk, jealously guarding his relationship with Sheffield Wednesday, and offered me little or no advice.' Mr Duckenfield told the jury he had not recognised the risk of over-crowding created by the existence of pens on the Leppings Lane terracing. 'I gave no thought to it either way,' he said. 'It wasn't something that came to mind. There was no evidence to suggest from previous events that I should have considered it.' Mr Duckenfield said he had not realised before the disaster that the lay-out of the Leppings Lane end 'formed something of a bottle-neck'. Asked who he thought was responsible for monitoring pens to prevent overcrowding, he said that both officers stationed around the stadium and stewards had a role to play. When Miss Lambert pointed out that the official plan for the game did not ascribe this duty to police, Mr Duckenfield said: 'In a perfect world I would have given certain officers a specific role in that order to do that.' He admitted that he had a responsibility to monitor overcrowding from the control box, but added: 'I didn't know the difference because of my inexperience of an overcrowded or full pen.' Campaigners welcomed Mr Duckenfield's appearance at court today. Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, told 5 News: 'It's very, very important because all the families, for 26 years now, have been desperate for Mr Duckenfield to come into an inquest and to answer questions. 'It was important to find out exactly what his role was and what he did on that day and why 96 people die', she said. Aspinall added: 'This is what we'd been fighting for for all of these years to get the inquest verdicts quashed because we know they were wrong.' The hearing continues tomorrow, when Mr Duckenfield will continue giving evidence.

"New York City's storied yellow cabs are taking a back seat to black cars. Uber cars, often black sedans that can be summoned with smartphone apps, now outnumber the yellow taxis that city riders have hailed with a whistle and a wave for generations. It was a changing-of-the-guard moment that passed with little fanfare this week in figures released by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission: 14,088 registered Uber cars compared with 13,587 yellow cabs. Uber cars, which are hailed by an app, now outnumber the yellow taxis in New York City, a place famous for its classic yellow cars (file photo) But it hardly means yellow cabs are out of favor. In fact, there are about 440,000 yellow cab rides a day, compared to just 20,000 to 30,000 Uber rides. That's because Uber drivers often own their own cars and work less than 40 hours a week, while most yellow taxis are owned by cab companies, have more than one driver and are on the road close to 24 hours a day. 'Yellow cab rides significantly outstrip the number of black car rides,' said Meera Joshi, chairwoman of the taxi commission. 'So the number of their affiliated vehicles in and of itself doesn't paint a complete picture.' Uber was introduced in New York City in 2011 and has grown steadily in popularity, particularly among tech-savvy customers who are comfortable hailing rides through an app that shows when a car is on the way. A customer can even follow its progress with a blip on a street map. Similar companies such as Lyft use apps to connect with riders. Prices are comparable, but some Uber riders have complained about fare add-ons for larger vehicles and 'surge pricing' during rush hour, bad weather or holidays. Figures released by the New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission shows that 14,088 registered Uber cars compared with 13,587 yellow cabs in the city (file photo) 'I absolutely do love the convenience, and if it's not surge pricing I find the costs very comparable and in some cases cheaper than yellow taxis,' said Kerry Farrell, a paralegal who uses Uber about three times a week. Uber spokesman Matt Wing declined to comment on the significance of the numbers of Uber cars surpassing yellow cabs. But some drivers and their advocates grumbled that Uber's growth has flooded the market, lowering average incomes for all drivers. 'Uber having an unlimited number of cars means no drivers — taxi or black car and livery — will earn a decent living,' said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, an advocacy group that includes both Uber and yellow cab drivers as members. Mamadou Diallo, who has been driving a yellow cab since 2004, said he once could count on at least 30 fares a day. But his take has dropped 30 to 40 percent since Uber and other such car services entered the New York market. 'It's a jungle,' he said, 'and the big fish always eat the small fish.' New York's 13,587 yellow cabs are in competition with smartphone-driven newcomers on city streets, especially the 14,088 registered Uber cars that now outnumber cabs. Here's a look at how the basic operations of the two compare. Yellow Cabs . Uber .","There are 14,088 registered Uber cars and 13,587 yellow cabs in New York .

"Teachers should be allowed to show Prophet Mohammed cartoons in school as part of a national curriculum on the Europe massacres caused by the images, Danish politicians have said. In January, 12 people at the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo which reprinted Danish cartoons, and later created some of their own, were shot dead in a jihadist attack on their Paris offices. And the Danish newspaper which originally printed 12 satirical cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005 sparked protests in parts of the Islamic world. The paper received death threats. In January, Cherif and Said Kouachi (pictured) shot 12 people dead in a jihadist attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in revenge for the paper printing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed . Solidarity: Just days after the attacks, an estimated 3.7million people took to the streets of Paris in a defiant show of support for Charlie Hebdo staff . Mai Mercado, a Conservative People's Party spokeswoman, wrote in the daily Jyllands-Posten: 'The cartoon crisis, the Charlie Hebdo killings and the latest terrorist attack in Copenhagen on February 14 are such an important part of history they should have a permanent place on the school curriculum.' However, she stressed that teachers would be free to choose whether or not to show the cartoons themselves, as long as the topic was discussed. 'Politically we don't regulate the details of what students are taught, that's an old tradition to make sure that Danish schools are kept free from political interference.' But she added that if teachers refused to show the cartoons she was 'convinced the students would go home and run a Google search because students are curious'. The Conservatives were shown as having 5.3per cent of voter support in a poll this week, meaning it would be the second smallest party in parliament if elections were held today. But the anti-immigrant Danish People's Party (DPP), which was ranked third with 19.6per cent support by the same poll, went even further, saying that showing the cartoons should be mandatory in schools. The Danish embassy in Damascus, Syria, is set alight after hundreds protest the cartoons printed in a Danish newspaper in 2005 . In 2005 a Danish newspaper's cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed triggered protests across the globe. Pictured are Iranian protesters burning a Danish flag . British Muslims protest outside the Danish embassy in Knightsbridge, London, in February 2006 during the controversy caused by the newspaper's cartoons . 'If you live in Denmark you should also be able to tolerate seeing the drawings,' party spokesman Alex Ahrendtsen told the daily Berlingske. However, the head of Denmark's teachers' union, Anders Bondo Christensen, said that he believed it should be up to each teacher to decide whether and how to talk about the controversial drawings. An appropriate way to discuss them could be to 'perhaps invite some Muslim children's parents to explain why it provokes' them, he told news agency Ritzau.","Danish politicians call for Charlie Hebdo attacks to be taught in schools .

"The Arkansas House . of Representatives on Tuesday passed a religious freedom bill . similar to one recently approved in Indiana, landing the contentious issue on Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson's desk. Hutchinson has said he'll sign the measure, even though he's facing protests from activists who say it could open the door to discrimination against . gays and lesbians. Like Indiana's new law, the Arkansas measure aims to keep the state government from forcing . business owners to act against their religious beliefs, but . critics say it will be a 'license to discriminate' by refusing service to . gays and lesbians. Concerns about wedding vendors who have religious objections to playing a part in same-sex ceremonies have driven most of the controversy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . HOOSIER 2.0: Arkansas will take the religious-liberty-firestorm baton from Indiana as soon as Gov. Asa Hutchinson signs his state's new law . Gov. Hutchinson, a former U.S. congressman who earned his college degree from the evangelical Bob Jones University, says he'll sign the bill . 'This legislation doesn't allow anybody to discriminate against anybody, not here,' Republican state Rep. Bob Ballinger told The Washington Post on Tuesday. 'The bill does just the opposite.' SURRENDER: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence walked back his state's new religious freedom law on Tuesday, saying he would work with lawmakers to 'fix' it . Ballinger, an attorney in private practice, sponsored the bill. He said the legislation 'focuses on the civil rights of people believing what they want to believe, and not letting the government interfere with that.' But he said he agrees with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who has been fighting a tide of resentment after he signed a similar bill into law, that 'there needs to be some clarity in the perception of the legislation.' 'As it sits right now,' he told the Post, his bill is 'not going to enable a person to discriminate.' Final approval came when the Arkansas House overwhelmingly . concurred with three amendments added by the Senate, which . approved the bill last week. Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola has asked Hutchinson to veto . the bill, saying in a letter on Tuesday the legislation is . unnecessary and could hurt the state's economy. 'Any piece of legislation that is so divisive cannotpossibly be good for the state of Arkansas and its people. Withthese kind of ""wedge"" issues,' no one is a winner on either side,' he said. Supporters said the law does not allow for discrimination . and is needed to protect religious freedoms. The Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce said it is 'bad . for business and bad for Arkansas.' Democrats said it will allow . for bigotry. 'Our history will tell us that when religion is used as a . sword it is often used to attack people of color and women,' said Representative Eddie Armstrong, an African-American and . Democratic floor leader. Arkansas-based retail giant Wal-Mart Stores said the bill sends the 'wrong message' about its home state. The outcry over the Indiana law was so fierce that the . state's governor, Republican Mike Pence, on Tuesday said he . would 'fix' the legislation to make it clear businesses . cannot use it to discriminate against same-sex couples. Earlier in March, a Senate-approved religious freedom bill in Georgia was put . on hold after a House member added anti-discrimination language. On Monday, North Carolina's governor said he would not sign similar language into law because it would allow government . officials to refuse to perform marriages on religious grounds. If enacted, the Arkansas proposal would prohibit state and local governments from infringing on a person's religious beliefs without a 'compelling' reason. But unlike in Indiana, Arkansas lawmakers said they will not modify their measure. SPONSOR: Arkansas GOP state Rep. Bob Ballinger watched the votes come in to support an amended versio nof his religious freedom bill in the state legislature on Tuesday; he says the measure isn't discriminatory . VETO! Hundreds of protesters yelled their demand that the governor turn away the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but Christians in the state House and Senate prevailed and the governor will enact the law . Over the past two days, hundreds of protesters filled Arkansas' Capitol to oppose the measure, holding signs that read 'Discrimination is not a Christian Value' and 'Discrimination is a Disease,' and chanting 'Shame on You' at Ballinger. Sexual orientation and gender identity are not included in Arkansas' anti-discrimination protections. Last month, Hutchinson allowed a measure to go into law that prevented local governments from including such protections in their anti-discrimination ordinances. This time he intends to affix his signature and make it the law of the Razorback State. 'I have said if this bill reaches my desk in similar form as to what has been passed in 20 other states then I will sign it,' the governor said Monday. 'But I am pleased that the legislature is continuing to look at ways to assure balance and fairness in the legislation.'","Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson says he'll enact the new setting his state up to be the next target of protests and business boycotts .

"A French teacher from Florida has been suspended for five days without pay after she was accused of calling her 14-year-old Muslim student a 'raghead Taliban' when he walked into class wearing a hoodie. The administrative complaint filed against Maria Valdes also claimed that, when the teacher called on on  Deyab-Houssein Wardani, she once asked 'Okay the Taliban, what is the answer?' It also alleged that the Cypress Bay High School teacher would say 'Ah no! The Taliban is here' when he walked into the classroom and would refer to him as a 'terrorista,' which is Spanish for terrorist. Scroll down for video . A French teacher from Florida has been suspended for five days without pay for allegedly calling her 14-year-old Muslim student Deyab-Houssein Wardani (pictured) a 'raghead Taliban' Deyab-Houssein, who did not know the Taliban referred to a terrorist organization until he asked his parents, said the other students in his class laughed at the nickname. 'I would not expect this from a teacher, teachers are supposed to set an example for their students,' he told the Sun Sentinel. 'It's very sad that people still think like that, that all Muslims are your average daily terrorist.' Valdes will also have to undergo a diversity training program. The punishment is not enough for Deyab-Houssein's father Youssef, who said that, at a minimum, he believes the teacher should have been suspended for a year without pay - if not fired. Wardani said the five-day suspension amounted to a 'vacation'. He made his anger loud and clear after the punishment was passed down at the Broward School Board's meeting on Tuesday. The father told school administrations they should 'all be removed for bullying,' according to Local 10. Superintendent Robert W. Runcie, who filed the administrative complaint after he was notified of Valdes' alleged comments, said the matter was taken 'very seriously' and was addressed with the 'appropriate sense of urgency'. 'I take a lot of exception to any statement, or suggestion that somehow this administration and school board did nothing or was ever lax in our response', he said, according to the Miami Herald. The punishment is not enough for Deyab-Houssein's father Youssef, who said that, at a minimum, he believes the teacher should have been suspended for a year without pay - if not fired . During the meeting Runcie, a Jamaican immigrant, said that he had personally been affected by racism. He shared the story of when he watched his mother get shot in the face by a man who blamed Jamaican immigrants for his inability to get a job. Wardani said this was not the first time his son, who is half Lebanese and half Moroccan, has experienced discrimination. In the fourth-grade a school bus driver who knew Deyab-Houssein was Muslim told him 'we're going to wipe you off the face of this planet and turn you into dust and sand,' Wardani told the Sun Sentinel. Although the school board voted unanimously to discipline the teacher, Wardani was not done fighting after the meeting was over. 'I promise you for the rest of my life, until my dying breath, I'm going to make sure no child goes through what my Deyab-Houssein had to go through,' said Wardani, who has reached out to the FBI . 'This is motivating me to work harder,' Deyab-Houssein said. 'To prove that I am not a random guy who you can call a Taliban' 'I promise you for the rest of my life, until my dying breath, I'm going to make sure no child goes through what my Deyab-Houssein had to go through,' he told the Miami Herald. Wardani said he has reached out to the FBI. District administrators said the degree of punishment that could be leveled against Valdes was limited because of an agreement with the Teachers Union. As for Deyab-Houssein, he said he is 'very proud' of his father and is getting support from his peers, but that he now feels a 'strange vibe' from his French teacher, 'like she doesn't want me to be there.' 'This is motivating me to work harder,' he said. 'To prove that I am not a random guy who you can call a Taliban.'","Florida French teacher Maria Valdes would allegedly say 'Ah no!

"Looks-based dating website BeautifulPeople.com hit the headlines recently when it ejected 3,000 members for letting themselves go. And now the site obsessed with beauty is facing an ugly backlash after thousands of people have started trolling the site in a bid to take revenge on their elitist policies. In an attack coordinated via social media, uglies wanting to take revenge on the site have been using fake profile pictures to become members of the exclusive dating community before then attempting to subvert the system by voting in 'ugly' people and voting out any good-looking potential members. Scroll down for video . Elitist dating site BeautifulPeople.com is facing a backlash from 'ugly' trolls after removing 3,000 members for letting themselves go. Uglies wanting to take revenge on the site have been using fake profile pictures to become members of the exclusive dating community before attempting to subvert the system . Last week it was revealed that BeautifulPeople.com had expelled over 3,000 people for not maintaining the appearance necessary to meet the high standards expected on the site. The move was welcomed by most of the member - but angered outsiders who disagreed with the site's selective policy. The 'Ugly' troll attack originated in Russia where over 2,700 applications were made to the site in a few hours. Over half of these were fake profiles and part of the ugly troll army. Similar coordinated attacks have come from the United States and the United Kingdom with 1,435 U.S. 'trolls' removed from the site and 400 from the UK in the past few days. BeautifulPeople.com is a site that is designed only with Beautifu lPeople in mind where users vote for those they think are the most attractive to stay on the site . 2,700 of the recent surge in fake profiles were from Russia, where the revenge campaign began . Greg Hodge, the managing director of BeautifulPeople.com, said: 'We had large spikes in numbers applying to join the site using profiles which immediately raised the suspicions of our administrators. 'Initially the scale of applications from specific geographical areas – Russia, the United States and the UK in particular – caused concern, when we examined the applications in more detail, we noticed a large number of what appeared to be fake profile pictures. 'We then traced this back to various social media sites calling for an attack on our site.' 'People had come together on forums such as Reddit to discuss the site and how they could hijack it by creating the fake profiles.' This is not the first time the site has been under attack. BeautifulPeople.com has been hit with 'denial of service' attacks, and had their rating system sabotaged in 2011. In response the site has introduced new measures to verify profiles and wannabe members must now take a webcam picture of themselves holding up a piece of card with their name and date written on it . Recently 3,000 members were removed because organisers felt they had let themselves go. This chap is an example of somebody who would make the BeautifulPeople.com grade . The site introduced a system of validated membership in 2012, whereby entrants are encouraged to take a webcam picture of themselves holding up a piece of paper with their name and date handwritten on it to prove that their pictures are genuine. Validated members get a 'verification stamp' on their profiles. Prior to the attack this feature was optional, but the makers have been forced to make profile verification mandatory. BeautifulPeople.com is the first dating site to force all users to prove they are genuine. Hodge said: 'Fake profiles are the number one problem in the online dating market today. 'We have always led the field in combating this. In taking this next step, we believe we will all but eliminate disingenuous profiles on our site and set the example for the online dating market as a whole. Online daters do not want their time wasted with fraudulent profiles.' The creators of BeautifulPeople.com are husband and wife duo Genevieve and Greg Hodge . He added: 'Having an exclusive dating site is not without controversy. There will always be a degree of jealousy from those who don't make the cut. 'Thankfully, through swift action by our administrators, vigilant members and the introduction of an extra level of verification has meant that we have been able to root out the attackers and ensure that our site remains beautiful and exclusive.' Entry to BeautifulPeople.com is only possible after passing a democratic rating process, where members of the opposite sex vote 'Yes definitely', 'Hmm yes, O.K', 'Hmm no, not really' and 'NO Definitely NOT' based on photographs and a brief profile submitted by new applicants. After the recent cull, over 800,000 members remain on the site, representing 190 countries and almost every ethnic and cultural background. A global average of one in ten applicants that apply to the site are accepted.","BeautifulPeople.com is an elitist internet dating site .

"CIA researchers have been involved in a 'sustained effort' for nearly a decade to crack the security protecting Apple iPhones and iPads. This is according to investigative news site, The . Intercept, who today cited documents obtained from . NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The report says top-secret documents reveal U.S. government researchers had created a version of XCode, Apple's . software application development tool, to create surveillance . backdoors. CIA researchers have been involved in a 'sustained effort' for nearly a decade to crack the security protecting Apple iPhones and tablets. This is according to, investigative news site, The Intercept, who claims to have access to top secret files detailing the spying activity . These backdoors would have allowed them access into programs distributed on Apple's App Store. The Intercept has in the past published a number of reports . from documents released by whistleblower Snowden. The site's . editors include Glenn Greenwald, who won a Pulitzer Prize for . his work in reporting on Snowden's revelations, and by . Oscar-winning documentary maker Laura Poitras. It said the latest documents, which covered a period from . 2006 to 2013, stop short of proving whether U.S. intelligence . researchers had succeeded in breaking Apple's encryption coding, . which secures user data and communications. Efforts to break into Apple products by government security . researchers started as early as 2006, a year before Apple . introduced its first iPhone and continued through the launch of . the iPad in 2010 and beyond, The Intercept said. The Intercept today cited documents obtained from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured).  It said the latest documents, which covered a period from2006 to 2013, stop short of proving whether U.S. intelligenc eresearchers had succeeded in breaking Apple's encryption coding . Breaching Apple security was part of a top-secret programme . by the U.S. government, aided by British intelligence . researchers, to hack 'secure communications products, both . foreign and domestic' including Google Android phones, it added. Silicon Valley technology companies have in recent months . sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that . their products have not become tools for widespread government . surveillance of citizens. Last September, Apple strengthened encryption methods for . data stored on iPhones. It claimed the changes meant the company no . longer had any way to extract customer data on the devices, even . if a government ordered it to with a search warrant. Silicon . Valley rival Google said shortly afterward that it . also planned to increase the use of stronger encryption tools. What is a 'backdoor'? A backdoor is a hidden remote access from an outside source to the device that enables the hacker to have almost full access with little detection. Should you be worried if you use an Apple device? Backdoors are not the type of thing an average hacker can easily exploit. So far there has been no evidence that they've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack . How would could the government potentially make use of these backdoors? Backdoors can provide access to unencrypted information even if users have chosen to encrypt the data they back up. Data can include the user's address book, stored photos, the voicemail database and any accounts configured on the device. What are the main concerns? Earlier this year, security expert Jonathan Zdziarski focused on three particular services known by the technical names com.apple.pcapd, com.apple.mobile.file_relay and com.apple.mobile.house_arrest that are a cause for concern. How do these hidden files work? The pcapd service starts a 'packet sniffer' on an iOS device which records all data traffic to and from your iPhone. It's installed by default on all iOS devices and gives the user no warning when it's activated. The file_relay service exists to sweep up large volumes of raw data from particular sources on an iPhone, and then release it in unencrypted form. These include the address book, accounts, GPS logs, photos, notes, calendar files, call history, voicemail and other records. The third service, house_arrest, originally allowed iTunes to copy documents to third-party apps. Now, as reported in ReadWrite, house_arrest has access to wider app-related data, including photos, databases, screenshots and temporary 'cached' information. More information about Apple's diagnostic capabilities is available from the firm's support pages. Both companies said the moves were aimed at protecting the . privacy of users of their products and that this was partly a . response to wide-scale U.S. government spying on internet users . revealed by Snowden in 2013. An Apple spokesman pointed to public statements by chief executive Tim Cook on privacy, but declined to comment further. 'I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked . with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor . in any of our products or services,' Cook wrote in a statement . on privacy and security published last year. 'We have also never . allowed access to our servers. And we never will.' Leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and British . Prime Minister David Cameron have expressed concern that turning . such privacy-enhancing tools into mass market features could . prevent governments from tracking militants planning attacks. The CIA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Silicon Valley technology companies have in recent months sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that their products have not become tools for widespread government surveillance of citizens . Last year, a security expert warned Apple’s iOS software contains potentially sinister tools that could be used by governments to spy on iPhone and iPad users. Speaking at the 'Hackers on planet Earth' conference in New York, Jonathan Zdziarski said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iPhone data. He added files found hidden within the firm's software contain a file-relay service that can be used to access the user's address book, photos, voicemail and any accounts configured on the device. The conclusion was based on an analysis of 600 million iOS devices, with handsets running the most recent versions of the software at particular risk. Mr Zdziarski said there is a file dubbed ‘com.apple.pcapd’ on the device that fires up without notifying the iOS device's owner. He explained this can record network traffic and HTTP request/response data from the device and could be targeted via Wi-Fi. ‘This software isn't some legacy code left on the device by Apple engineers for testing - it has been actively updated and expanded in various iOS revisions,’ The Register claimed. Backdoors are not the type of thing an average hacker can easily exploit, and so far there has been no evidence they've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack . Apple responded by saying the services identified by Mr Zdziarski are not deliberately provided for government agencies to exploit. The company added they are for 'diagnostic' purposes, and to allow IT workers to manage their company’s devices.","This is according to Intercept which claims to have seen top secret files .

"This is the horrific moment a five-year-old boy fell to his death after getting tangled in a kite and being dragged more than 60ft in the air. Van Minh Dat, aged five, had been helping his mother out at her drinks stall at the Dong Dieu kite field in Ho Chi Minh, the largest city in Vietnam, when the accident happened. Dat was fatally injured when his legs accidentally got caught up in the kite's string and he was flung into the air before the string snapped when he was around 65ft above the ground. Scroll down for video . Van Minh Dat, aged five, had been helping his mother out at her drinks stall at the Dong Dieu kite field in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, when his legs became tangled in the string of a giant kite and he was dragged into the air . The video shows the little boy flying through the air before falling as a crowd of horrified onlookers scream in terror. Although still alive when he hit the ground the little boy died in an ambulance on his way to hospital. His aunt, who witnessed the accident, said the giant kite - which had a 49ft span - was being launched by members of the Saigon Kite Club. She said: 'Everyone was looking at them because the kite had fallen to the ground a couple of times as the weather was a bit erratic. 'One of the lines snagged a table near the drinks stand and knocked over some chairs as well. The little boy was flung into the air and can be seen being pulled across the sky by the giant kite . 'Dat had run over to pick up some of the fallen soft drink bottles when his leg got tangled in the kite string, which just took off when it was hit by strong winds.' She said she and others rushed over to try and pull the kite back down but it shot into the air and was impossible to stop. Dat fell when the string holding him snapped and although it is believed he tried to grab a second string it was too late. The field was being used by kite flyers who were practising for an upcoming festival. A city council spokesman said there were officials on hand designed to keep children away from the kites and prevent such a tragedy, but because the boy was with his mother working at one of the stands he had apparently been overlooked. A full investigation is being carried out. Dat can be seen being lifted by his legs and dragged up into the air as the kite pulls him into the sky .","Van Minh Dat, aged 5, was killed after being dragged more than 60ft in air .

"A wealthy couple falsely claimed £42,000 in benefits despite sending their children to a £32,000 private school and having nearly £50,000 in their bank account, a court was told  today. Sarah Grant, also received a £40,000 payment from her parents and was drawing income as a director of three companies during the time she and husband Leslie, 67, were claiming benefits, Gloucester Crown Court has heard. The couple sent their children to a £32,000-a-year school while also funding £2,000-a-month in rent on their home. But the pair are alleged to have falsely claimed a total of £42,500, consisting of £19,000 of pension benefit, £19,000 of housing benefit and £4,500 of council tax benefit to fund their lifestyle. On trial: Sarah and Leslie Grant are accused of claiming £42,000 of benefits while getting an income from several businesses and £50,000 in the bank, a court has heard . Mr and Mrs Grant say they were penniless as a number of businesses went bust and needed state support. This was received while Mrs Grant got money from her mum, there was income from the pair's businesses and business account were being used for personal expenditure, it was said. Prosecutors also say they had around £50,000 in the bank, but today a second forensic accountant told the court she felt that the Grants had no income entering their bank accounts. Mr Grant, 67, had been receiving pension credit since November 2007, despite running his wife's companies, Hadleigh Partnership, Hadleigh Development and Sarafino Ltd, prosecutors claim. Funds were used to sent their children to Dean Close School in Cheltenham, Glos., and to pay for expensive child care and high rent. Tara Wolfe, told the opening of the trial: 'We say Mr and Mrs Grant knew they were under an obligation to inform the Dept of Work and Pensions and the council of money coming into their accounts which affected their entitlement to benefits. 'The prosecution say they had income coming in from three sources. Between September 2010 and Oct 2011 Mrs Grant received £40,000 from her parents. 'There was also income from her position as a director of three limited companies that were trading during the material time and which Mr Grant was running. 'And they were using their business accounts for personal expenditure.' Investigations into their affairs began when questions were raised about how they were able to pay £1,950 a month rent with just £775 a month housing allowance. Mrs Grant was questioned by benefit officials in May 2010 and said that her parents had paid the rent shortfalls and school fees. Top private school: The Grants' children attended £32,000-a-year Dean Close School in Cheltenham while the couple was claiming benefits, the court heard . The couple, from Cheltenham, claim that the firms they were involved in at the time were in liquidation. On Wednesday a forensic accountant told the court that after analysing the pair's bank accounts it was clear they had more than £48,000 available to them. He explained that between them the pair had four bank accounts and his job was to analyse the accounts to decide what was 'personal' income and what related to the business. He told the jury that he assessed each payment made and even went through nine ring binders full of receipts to try and ascertain where cash had been spent. In his report he also asked: 'What is income? Luxury items such as school fees, extravagant holidays, expensive purchases, nice clothes, could all mean an income. 'If you're spending on these things there must be a source to do it. 'But they could also be the result of credit cards debts, or gifts. School fees for example, which were on their bank statements, imply an income, or it could just be the result of a gift.' The accountant, Neil Ward, concluded that the pair had a total of £48,206.59, which was assessable for pension credit. He told that £40,000 of that had come from Mrs Grant's mother. On trial: Speaking at Gloucester Crown Court (above), prosecutor Tara Wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of about £42,500 to which they were not entitled . The defence argued that it therefore counted as a gift, but when prosecutor, Tara Wolfe, asked the witness: 'would a gift of £40,000 be eligible for pension credit?' he responded: 'I believe so'. Mr and Mrs Grant both deny falsely claiming pension credits and housing and council tax benefit without declaring they had other income. But defence witness Helen Gregory- a forensic accountant - said the couple were clearly struggling with money as a number of their businesses went under. She explained how Sarafinos Ltd, a coffee shop opened in Folkestone and Birmingham, was hoped to become a chain but it collapsed shortly after opening. Instead the pair opened a restaurant called The Courtyard in Cheltenham. The couple also opened D'Altos, a company aimed at running fast food outlets which ran for just two months. The couple's building companies, Hadleigh Partnership and Hadleigh Development also went into liquidation. Mrs Gregory also argued that the £40,000 given to Sarah Grant by her mother was clearly a loan and did not count as income. She said: 'They were struggling. They were doing their best to make things work. They had a number of businesses and they had become accustomed to a certain lifestyle. 'Their businesses went under but they were trying to maintain that level of living. 'It took them about a year to try and get back on their feet financially. 'I don't believe they were receiving any income. I understood the money to be a short term loan from Mrs Grant's mother to get her back on her feet.' The trial continues.

"One of Britain's oldest ever naturally conceiving mothers says she has no regrets about keeping her baby. Debbie Hughes hit the headlines when she fell pregnant with son, Kyle, in 2010 when she was 53. Now aged 57, she says having a toddler is challenging but she wouldn't want her life to be any different. Scroll down for video . Debbie Hughes, 57, pictured on today's Lorraine said there are no downsides to being a mother in her fifties . 'He's four in June, he's a handful but he's lovely,' she said on today's Lorraine. 'He's younger than my two granddaughters who are five and six so he's their uncle but they will grow up more like cousins.' On how she copes as an older mother, Debbie, from Daventry, Northamptonshire, said: 'I act younger and feel younger, I keep myself trim. 'There's no downside, to me it's no different. I have been a mum since 1979 so I never had an empty nest. Just when I think they are growing up I've had another one as I have massive age gaps between them all. It's normal for me.' The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics show that more women than ever are having babies later in life in order to focus on their education and careers. The statistics show that double the number of women are now having babies over the age of 35 than they were in 1990, despite it being the time when fertility is said to plummet. The number of over-50s giving birth has more than doubled in the past five years, with three children every week in Britain born to a mother in this age group. Debbie told Lorraine Kelly she copes with her toddler by 'acting younger and keeping trim' Kyle, pictured on today's Lorraine, will turn four in June and his mother said he's a handful but wonderful . Debbie, a jewellery assistant, said she had no plans to become a mother again when she fell pregnant at 53 with her then partner Paul Clarke, 47, a heavy goods vehicle driver, as she had been on the Pill. At the time, she already had two sons Mark, 26, and Brandon, 11. She also had a daughter, Hayley, who died tragically just a week before her 18th birthday. Debbie is also grandmother to Mark's daughters - Lydia, now five, and Nicole, now six. On falling pregnant, Debbie told Lorraine Kelly: 'It just happened, I started noticing weight around my tummy and couple of people pointed it out. 'I thought I can't be pregnant, not at my age. I got a test and then another one and another one - four in total! 'When I went to my doctor he nearly fell off the chair! But when I showed him the tests he said, ""well, you definitely are"". Mother and son pictured after Kyle was born in June 2011 weighing 7lb 11oz . Despite being in her fifties, Debbie said the pregnancy was 'fine' and she had no health concerns. She said: 'I didn't put on any surplus weight, I didn't feel tired. In some ways it was better than some of other pregnancies, I just got on with it.' Debbie went into labour in June 2011 and gave birth naturally to Kyle at Northampton General Hospital, weighing 7lb 11oz. She said: 'I have no regrets at all, it's wonderful and everyone has been supportive, Northampton hospital and my GP gave me loads of support.' The ONS report on the rise of older mothers in Britain published last month said: 'Reasons for an increased number of women conceiving at ages 30 and above included increased participation in higher education; increased female participation in the labour force; the increasing importance of a career; the rising opportunity costs of childbearing; labour market uncertainty, housing factors and the instability of partnerships.' Debbie pictured with baby Kyle and her grandchildren Lydia (then aged two, now five) and Nicole (then three, now six) who are older than their uncle . There were 14 pregnancies for every 1,000 women over 40 in 2012, more than double the 1990 rate of 6.6 per cent. Births to mothers over 40 are now running at four times the levels of the 1980s. In an interview with the Daily Mail last year, Debbie admitted she does worry about Kyle's future as a result of her having him so late in life. She said: 'Sometimes, when I watch Kyle play, my mind wanders and I worry about not living to see his 30s, but you just have to put those thoughts to the back of your mind. 'Whatever the difficulties, Kyle is a blessing.' Debbie, pictured with Kyle as a toddler, said she has no regrets but she sometimes worries about his future .","Debbie Hughes from Daventry, Northamptonshire, fell pregnant at 53 .

"Two American tourists have been arrested for carving initials into the Colosseum in Rome. Before they were spotted, the women, 21 and 25, were able to carve a J and an N into a brick wall on the first floor of the west side of the Colosseum. After carving the eight-inch high letters, the women posed together for a selfie. The women, just two of six million tourists that flock to the Colosseum every year, used a coin to engrave the letters, La Stampa reported. They are said to have broken away from their tour group before - but other tourists saw what had happened and alerted security. Police charged the women with 'aggravated damage on building of historical and artistic interest', according to Republica. After they were caught, the women  apologized to Piazza Dante police and Captain Lorenzo Iacobone. They said: 'We apologize for what we did. We regret it but we did not imagine it was something so serious. 'We'll remember for a lifetime.' According to the Guardian, the section damaged dates back to the 1800s - a key period of restoration. A spokesman for the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome is quoted as saying: 'It’s not an original wall but it’s nevertheless antique.' With approximately six million visitors to the Colosseum each year and ever-increasing staff cuts, policing the site has become a major problem. Sadly many of the stones bear the unsightly engravings of tourists keen to leave their mark. The Californians’ lawbreaking comes little over three months after a Russian tourist was caught carving a 25cm letter into the Colosseum. The 42-year-old was given a four-month suspended prison sentence and a €20,000 fine, although owing to a lack of funds he has not paid the penalty. Two tourists from the United States were caught engraving their initials at the Colosseum in Rome, Italy . The women were charged with 'aggravated damage on a building of historical and artistic interest' on Saturday . He was said to be the fifth tourist seen defacing the Colosseum in 2014. A father and son from Australia and teenagers from Brazil and Canada were also caught out last year. Built in the first century CE, the Colosseum is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site. In order to make the  UNESCO list, a site must have a special cultural or physical significance. The Colosseum, which is also called the Flavian Amphitheatre, was named after a colossal statue that once stood nearby. The structure 'accommodated games of great popular appeal, such as hunts and gladiatorial fights' until the end of the Ancient Age, according to the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome. The organization adds: 'The building was, and still is today, a show in itself. 'In fact, it is the largest amphitheatre not only in the city of Rome but in the world, able to offer stunning sceneries as well as services for spectators.'","The women, aged 21 and 25, broke away from their tour group on Saturday .

"A boy has been killed after picking up and eating a lollipop coated in rat poison that had been thrown into the yard where he was playing. Xiao Li, six, had found the sweet lying in the front yard of his house in Liuzhuang village in eastern China's Shandong province when he picked it up, unwrapped it, and put it in his mouth. He then went out to play hide and seek with friends and was found shortly afterwards unconscious. Xiao Li, six, was killed after picking up and eating a lollipop coated in rat poison . Li (circled) was caught on CCTV eating the poisoned lolly before he played hide and seek . This is the spot where Li picked up the poisoned lolly . Deadly: This is the lolly that Li ate, reportedly . Tragically, the lolly was covered in a substance 100 times more toxic than cyanide. His pals ran to get help and found Li's dad Jin Hsueh, 45 who discovered his son, still unconscious, was bleeding from his eyes, ears, nostrils and mouth. He said: 'They told me that Li was lying behind a bush where he had been hiding from them during a game. 'When I got there he was hardly breathing and I knew something terrible had happened.' Li was rushed to the nearby Jining Affiliated Medical School Hospital, where medics quickly realised the condition was critical. Heartbreak: Li's father found his son in a critical condition, bleeding from his eyes, ears, nostrils and mouth . The lolly that Li put in his mouth was covered in TETS, or tetramethylenedisulfotetramine. It's an odorless and tasteless poison that's fatal for humans in quantities of just 7 to 10mg and above. It is 100 times more toxic than cyanide and there is no known antidote. It was banned around the world in 1984 but still finds its way into China in rat poison, as it's very easy to produce. A hospital spokesman said: 'His internal organs had been destroyed by the poison and his blood had turned black.' Doctors fought to save him for two days before little Li succumbed to the poison and died. Tests carried out on the lollipop which the boy still had on him showed that it had been coated in TETS, a highly lethal neurotoxin found in rat poison. Its use worldwide has been banned since 1984 but is still readily available in China, although illegally. Now police suspect someone close to the family may have been responsible for his death. A police spokesman said: 'We have checked the location of where the lollipop was in the family's yard and we found a couple more. 'The only way they could have got there is if someone walked in and put them there as it is impossible to reach from the road. 'And if they had been thrown over the wall, they would have broken. We are looking into who would have a motive to do this.'","Xiao Li found the sweet lying in the front yard of his house in Shandong .

"Tributes have been paid to Sergeant Louise Lucas who has died after a collision with a bus in Swansea . A policewoman sacrificed her life in front of a bus to save her eight-year-old daughter on a 'lethal' city centre road. Tributes have poured in for Cardiff police officer Sergeant Louise Lucas, 41, who died after sustaining serious injuries in the collision on the Kingsway in Swansea yesterday. Her eight-year-old daughter, Olivia, suffered minor injuries following the crash with the X11 bus at 11.25am. She was off-duty when she took Olivia to the shops as a treat together. Onlookers have said the pair were crossing the road and were inches from a bus - but Sgt Lucas pushed her daughter to safety and took the full impact of the collision. The mother-of-three was rushed to the city's Morriston hospital where doctors battled to save her but she later died. Her son Grant, 21,said: 'Mum was the best there is and was simply amazing. 'Olivia is fine and only suffered minor injuries, but mum passed away later this afternoon. 'I am absolutely well and truly gutted.' The officer also has a younger child called Lloyd - an aspiring footballer who is in Swansea city's development squad. She lived with her husband Gavin, 36, at the family home in Llanishen, Cardiff. Grant said that he wanted to make his mother 'proud' and would help to raise Olive and Lloyd. He added: 'It's mad how my mum and I became much closer over the last couple of weeks and had it all planned out. 'On behalf of the family, we would like to thank all friends for their support.' South Wales Police assistant chief constable Jon Stratford posted on Twitter: 'Tonight our thoughts are with the family of Louise Lucas. 'A superb officer, committed to her community with a great sense of fun. So sad.' Deputy chief constable Matt Jukes wrote: 'Awful day for South Wales Police and above all, for the family of PS Louise Lucas. My heartfelt condolences. A great cop - we will truly miss her.' And assistant chief constable of territorial policing Richard Lewis added: 'Incredibly sad day for all officers at South Wales Police after the tragic death of Sgt Louise Lucas. 'My sincere condolences are with her family tonight.' Sgt Lucas, who most recently served in the Llanishen area of Cardiff, was well known in the community . Sgt Lucas, who most recently served in the Llanishen area of Cardiff, was well known in the community. Cardiff City councillor Jayne Cowan paid tribute to Louise posting: 'Louise was an inspirational, hard working and terrific person. (I'm) proud to have known and spent time with her.' Community website My Whitchurch posted: 'Very sad to hear of the tragic death of PS Louise Lucas. Based in Llanishen, she was one in a million. A bright star in a dark sky.' As news of her sad death spread tributes to Sgt Lucas were posted by police and emergency services across the UK using the hashtag #999family. Surrey Roads Police posted: 'Our thoughts are with the family, friends & colleagues of Sgt Louise Lucas of South Wales Police.' And officers from the Met Police in Barking and Dagenham wrote: 'Thoughts are with the friends, family and colleagues of Sergeant Louise Lucas at this very sad time.' A spokesman for the South Wales Police Federation, which represents officers in the force, described the news as devastating. He said: 'Louise brightened any room she walked into and her tragic passing at such a young age will leave a huge gap within South Wales Police, her friends who loved her, but most importantly for her family, who have lost a devoted mother and wife. South Wales Police confirmed it was continuing to investigate the cause of the tragic incident and appealed for witnesses . 'Words at this painful time can provide little consolation, but as part of her police family we share the sense of grief and loss at her passing and hope to help her children, husband, family and friends come to terms with their loss.' South Wales Police confirmed it was continuing to investigate the cause of the tragic incident and appealed for witnesses. Inspector Steve Davies said: 'Our thoughts are with the family at this very sad time and they are being supported by specially trained officers. 'I would also like to pay tribute to the efforts of the emergency services at the scene in very difficult circumstances.' The Kingsway has long been branded a death-trap by many local residents. In 2006 the road was changed from a standard dual carriageway to a two-way bus lane on one side and a one-way system for cars on the other. There have been a number of accidents on the city centre road in recent years - including the death of 37-year-old Gower man Daniel Foss, who died after being hit by a National Express coach. Emergency services were called to Kingsway in Swansea following the crash between the two pedestrians and the X11 bus at about 11.25am . Although markings on the pavement tell pedestrians which way to look, many shoppers and workers label the 'continental Kingsway' as confusing. Several residents took to Twitter following news of Mrs Lucas's death calling on Swansea Council to change the road back to how it used to be. Chris Stephens wrote: 'When will the council learn that the road layout is dangerous?' And Kate Jenkins added: 'That bus lane set up is completely lethal and needs to change.' A young woman died last night and three children were injured after a bus and a car collided in south west London. The woman, who was a pedestrian in her twenties, was critically injured and died at the scene, police said. A car containing two adults and three children was also involved in the crash, which took place at around 9pm on Penrhyn Road, Kingston upon Thames. They were injured and are being treated at the scene, while the bus driver received minor injuries. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said no arrests have been made.","Sergeant Louise Lucas died after collision with bus in Swansea city centre .

"One naked neighbor has set off a flurry of complaints in the Charlotte community where he lives, but police are telling residents there's nothing they can do about it. Homeowners in Cardinal Glen in north Charlotte claim that a man in the neighborhood has often stood stark naked in the doorway of his home over the last 10 years. Those flustered residents have tried to phone the police, only to be told that the nude man next door isn't actually breaking any laws. Stark raving mad: Neighbors in Cardinal Glenn . 'Because my daughter grew up in this neighborhood,' Adrienna Harris told WBTV about her growing agitation. 'Even this week, when she was home from spring break, she would call me at work and say ""Mom, I'm getting ready to go outside, but let me check if he's out there first."" That's how bad it is in the neighborhood.' Harris says she called police several times in the past, and every time has been informed the man has done nothing wrong. On Friday, people in the neighborhood, including Pecolia Threatt, tried the police one more time. 'I was out rolling the trash can on Friday and I just happened to look over there and he was standing there buck naked,' Threatt said. A Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department spokeswoman confirmed that police were called Friday, but that charges have ever been filed. 'Since it is not a criminal incident, it was documented in the ""call for service"" but there is no report,' the official told the Observer. The spokeswoman also told the paper that officers had spoken with the magistrate, who agreed with the officers that the man was not violating any laws since he was on his property. Indecent exposure laws vary state by state, but North Carolina's states outlines it as 'willfully expos[ing] the private parts of his or her person in any public place.' Residents in the neighborhood said they took videos and photos of the man, in order to present a case for a nuisance complaint to the Homeowners Association.","Residents are upset that the man cannot be charged with indecent exposure because he's on his own property .

"15 people and counting have been charged after an enormous 300-person street brawl broke out in Mount Isa, Queensland. Police were called to Gardner Street and Able Smith Parade at 4.25 am on Saturday morning after multiple complaints of fighting and property damage. All of the rostered staff attended the scene, however off duty officers, The Tactical Crime Squad and the Dog Squad had to be called in as back up. 15 people have been charged with public nuisance after a 300-person brawl broke out in Mount Isa . The riot is believed to have stemmed from a family feud that spilled onto the street. The ABC have reported that the violent brawl took an hour and a half and 16 officers to dissipate. A 19-year-old woman was charged with serious assault after she was allegedly in possession of a knife and headbutted a female police officer who was uninjured. 15 others were charged with public nuisance and willful damage. The fight involved people brandishing fence palings and broken bottles as weapons. Surprisingly, no one was injured. The brawl took 16 police officers, including the Dog Squad and Tactical Crime Squad to contain . Smaller groups were allegedly fighting within the larger group and alcohol is believed to be the cause for the incident. Mount Isa Police Inspector Trevor Kidd has labelled the fight as 'ridiculous behaviour,' the Townsville Bulliten have reported.

"Four lingerie-clad women drew on their bodies with Sharpie markers to highlight their physical shortcomings - like a plastic surgeon during a consultation - for a powerful photo series that ridicules the media's depiction of female bodies. Sarah Coffman from San Diego, California, enlisted three friends, whom she refers to as Tiffany Stevens, Rose Lee and Ashley A, for the provocative photoshoot, which was shot by photographer Terrance Smalls. The images from the aptly-named Lines Series show the women reading magazine featuring models and actresses while they sit in a doctor's office waiting room covered in marker. 'We live in a society where women are constantly being stripped down and evaluated, without physically being stripped down,' Terrance explained on his website. Powerful message: Sarah Coffman (center) stood up while Tiffany Stevens(left) and Rose Lee (right) pointed out her flaws in the provocative photo series shot by Terrance Smalls . Media pressure: The three women read the popular men's magazine Maxim, famous for featuring scantily-clad women on its cover, while they sit in a waiting room in their underwear . Dream girls: The trio, who used Sharpie markers to highlight their physical flaws, pointed and stared at the models in Vogue . He continued: 'Well, what does it look like when we actually strip women down and evaluate their physical ""shortcomings""? How insane does it look? How uncomfortable does it make us feel? The purpose of this series was to find out.' Sarah, Tiffany and Rose wore patterned bras and underwear and donned coiffed hair and a faces full of make-up for the series, which puts a bold spin on pin-up inspired photoshoots. Terrance explained that their over-the-top beauty looks were a 'conscious decision' that they made to further drive their point across. 'Yes, the ladies are wearing a lot of makeup (more than they would if they were just going out) and yes, the images have been retouched,' he noted. Body anxiety: Tara can be seen agonizing over her body as she stares in the mirror in this photo . Ridiculous standards: The three women were photographed as they made faces at the pictures they were seeing the magazines . Can't compare: Rose and Sarah look shocked as they stare at the models in the magazines they are reading . Look here: Rose held a magazine while Tara and Sarah pointed at images that caught their attention . Mean girls: Sarah and Rose sneered at Tara, who was sitting between them and obliviously reading Maxim . Meanwhile, Ashley sported a more business oriented look and posed in a camisole and a pencil skirt before she shed her clothes and exposed the markings on her body. All of the women had lines and arrows drawn over their breasts, on areas of their stomachs and around their arms and thighs, highlighting what many might perceive to be their ‘problem’ areas. While the series was created last August, Sarah, 23, who goes by the name ‘nerdygypsy’ online, shared the images on Reddit yesterday, writing: 'So my friends and I put on a photoshoot a few months back, this became the result.' She continued: 'We were trying to more or less expose the ridiculousness involved in photoshoots.' Touch up: Terrance explained that it was a 'conscious decision' for the models to wear more make-up than they do in real life . Baring all: Rose wore a hot pink bra and a black thong with pink bows during the photoshoot . Eye contact: Rose put her hands on her hips as she looked over her shoulder at the camera and flaunted her derriere . Strike a pose: The photo series proves that women are insecure about their bodies no matter what the size because of how the media portrays female bodies . The girls can be seen measuring each other's waists, pointing out their flaws with their fingers, staring at their bodies in the mirror and pouring over men's magazines in the images that aim to start a discussion about body image. When Terrance first posted some of the images to is Instagram account in 2014, he received an overwhelmingly positive response from his followers. 'That's what true beauty is. Not afraid to be and show urself for who u really are. Spite what other people say or think of you [sic],' one person wrote, while another commented: 'Great message.'

"Nicola Sturgeon yesterday vowed to work with Labour to ‘lock the Tories out’ of power. In an extraordinary speech in London, Scotland’s first minister claimed voters across the UK would welcome her party’s influence at Westminster, saying she would end austerity. But, following mounting pressure from senior colleagues, Ed Miliband last night tried to draw a line under speculation about a Labour-SNP government by ruling out a formal coalition. Labour leader Ed Miliband said a formal coalition with the SNP 'will not happen' - but failed to rule out forming a looser alliance on a vote-by-vote basis . The Labour leader said there would be ‘no SNP ministers’ in any government he leads after May’s general election. But Mr Miliband pointedly refused to rule out a deal that would see the resurgent Scottish nationalists prop up a minority Labour government in key Commons votes – the preferred option of Miss Sturgeon. ‘This was a lot of hype to rule out something no one was proposing,’ the first minister said. ‘Mr Miliband’s statement is absolutely fine from our point of view, because formal coalition with seats in the UK government has never been our preference. ‘But working with Labour in a looser arrangement, I certainly wouldn’t rule out because I want to see SNP MPs in the House of Commons pushing for progressive change. I also don’t want to see David Cameron re-elected. 'As long as there are more SNP and Labour MPs than there are Tory MPs, we can lock the Tories out of government, there is no question about that.’ Pollsters suggest the SNP is on course for an unprecedented breakthrough at the general election, winning dozens of Labour seats and depriving Mr Miliband of any chance of a majority. John Curtice, of Strathclyde University and one of the country’s leading election experts, said the SNP appeared on the brink of winning 45 of Scotland’s 59 seats. Ms Sturgeon, appearing on ITV's Lorraine show, claimed that if Labour ruled out a deal with the SNP they would be saying they were happy to see David Cameron 'waltz back in to Number 10' ‘That means the formation of any government after May 7 will be with the acquiescence of the SNP,’ the professor added. ‘Mr Miliband’s chances may indeed depend on him coming to some arrangement with the SNP.’ Electoral deals between two or more parties can take various guises. A full-scale coalition is a power-sharing deal of the kind struck by David Cameron and Nick Clegg, with a shared programme and ministers from different parties. One step down from a coalition is an arrangement called ‘confidence and supply’. In exchange for concessions to its interests, a smaller party agrees to back a larger one in key Commons votes. A still looser arrangement is possible, whereby a minority Labour government would negotiate with the SNP to win its backing on every major vote. William Hague, the Leader of the Commons, said an issue-by-issue deal between Labour and the SNP would be ‘even worse’. ‘Every day the SNP could come back with more demands,’ said the Tory MP. Miss Sturgeon, speaking at the London School of Economics, set out a shopping list of demands for a deal with Labour, including £180billion of extra borrowing, ditching the Trident nuclear deterrent, and billions more in benefits for the working poor. She said the SNP would ensure that any government it supports offered an ‘alternative to austerity’. In the past, the SNP imposed a ‘self-denying ordinance’ on its MPs which prevented them from voting on most ‘English-only’ issues at Westminster. But, with the possibility of a power-sharing deal in sight, this principle has been ditched. Miss Sturgeon yesterday said SNP MPs were entitled to dictate policy at Westminster in return for their votes. ‘We have clear and constructive views on many aspects of UK policy which affect Scotland deeply – views which we know are often shared by many people elsewhere in the UK. And we intend to bring those ideas forward in a positive spirit,’ she said. She insisted that voters in England could trust her not to use a hung parliament as part of a plan to make another attempt to break up the country. Last night an ICM poll for the Guardian revealed 43 per cent of voters are worried about the SNP determining who runs the UK. Labour leader in Scotland Jim Murphy (left) said the party would not make any 'backroom deals' with the SNP .","SNP chief said she would vote Green in England and Plaid Cymru in Wales .

"If you think your family is a handful, spare a thought for Sarah Ward. Every day, the busy mum from Crayford, Kent, changes up to 30 nappies, eight sets of clothes, makes 12 bottles of milk and washes and irons four loads of washing.

Sarah Ward celebrates her first Mother's Day at home with her young brood (from front left) Freddie and triplets Stanley, Daisy and Reggie . The day is especially significant for Sarah as she feared she might never conceive. She said: 'The last year has been hard work and being a mum to four one year olds is crazy and yes it is like running a nursery at times but I would not change it for the world. ‘I used to dread Mother’s Day when I was struggling to fall pregnant, now I cannot wait - they are my little miracles.’ Sarah's son Freddie was just eight weeks old when she discovered she was pregnant again. Every day busy mum Sarah Wards changes up to 30 nappies, eight sets of clothes, makes 12 bottles of milk and washes and irons four loads of washing . When the doctors discovered that she was expecting triplets, they advised her to abort one of hte babies to give the other two a better chance of survival. But Sarah and her partner Benn Smith, 31,decided to keep all three. She said: ‘I just couldn’t do it. How could I pick one? 'Thank God I didn’t because look at them now. They are perfect.' Sarah said that looking after four children under the age of one makes her the 'luckiest mum in the world and possibly the most tired too' Against the odds, the triplets were born seven weeks prematurely on March 10 last year when big brother Freddie was still only nine months old. Stanley arrived first weighing 3lb 12oz, followed by Reggie, 4lb 7oz and sister Daisy 3lb 14oz. The babies were rushed straight to special baby care where the family spent their first Mother’s Day fraught with worry. They were finally discharged a few weeks later, so this will be their first ever Mother’s Day at home as a family. Sarah (pictured with triplet Reggie and eldest son Freddie) and her postal worker partner Benn Smith (pictured with triplets Daisy and Stanley) defied doctors' advice to terminate one of the triplets due to health concerns . Proud Sarah says she still feels like the luckiest mother alive after once fearing she would never be a mother at all. She had been booked in to see her GP over suspected fertility problems when she conceived Freddie, who was born 1st June 2013. She added: ‘Mother’s Day feels so exciting this year because we finally have them all at home. 'Now I have the family I always dreamed of and more. ‘I am the luckiest mum in the world and possibly the most tired too.’ Postal worker Benn plans to treat Sarah to a meal and chocolates – and she certainly deserves to put her feet up.

"Gerald Taylor, 40, brandished a knife after being told by job centre advisors that he would lose his benefits if he did not try harder to find a job . A benefits claimant who has not worked for 25 years trashed a Job Centre and brandished a knife after being told he would lose his payments if he didn't try harder to get a job. Gerald Taylor, 40, was locked in a 90-minute stand-off with police after  being told his benefits could be axed at Fleetwood Job Centre in Lancashire. Preston Crown Court heard Taylor was 'aggressive and argumentative' at an appointment on January 26 after advisors raised concerned about his efforts to find employment. Taylor, from South Shore, Blackpool, threatened that the centre should be torched and stormed out of the building, before returning 45 minutes later with a hammer and smashing two windows. The jobseeker, whose 59 previous convictions include burglary and arson, was disarmed by a passer-by, but later pulled out the knife as officers arrived at the scene. Harry Pepper, prosecuting, said: 'He was holding the knife to his wrist. 'When not doing that officers saw he was waving it around and demanding to speak to a Job Centre employee about his benefits.' The court heard Taylor told police he had been out of work for 25 years due to his lengthy list of convictions and his lack of experience. David Traynor, defending, said: 'He had no funds to make phone calls to get jobs. 'In the week before this incident he had found five jobs he wanted to apply for, but had no credit or money to make those phone calls.' Taylor was sentenced to 42 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to threatening behaviour, criminal damage and possessing a bladed article. Judge Christopher Cornwall told Taylor: 'You are a man with no self control. Taylor smashed windows with a hammer before pulling out the knife at Fleetwood Job Centre (pictured) in Lancashire. The jobseeker, who has 59 previous convictions, was jailed for 42 weeks at Preston Crown Court . 'If thwarted as you were, or perceived you were, you react in this wholly unacceptable way.' The judge added his actions were a 'complete waste of police time' 'It is a pretty remarkable feature of this case that you held however many police officers at bay for over one and a half hours - a complete waste of police time,' he said. 'Those officers really were not to know just exactly how an unpredictable man was actually going to behave. 'Was he suddenly going to make a run at them or not?' A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: 'If you are claiming Jobseekers Allowance the rules are that you have got to be available for work and actively looking for work. 'If you don't do that you could be sanctioned. Whether his case is exceptional or not it is almost impossible to say.'","Gerald Taylor became angry after advisors said payments could be axed .

UPI reports that Ohio police are now trying to locate the driver of the car after the photos caused speculation over animal abuse. 'Immediately, I was thinking ‘How in the world did that cat get on there?’' Vandall told Fox. 'I don’t believe she drives around town with a cat on, you know? I thought there’s probably a really good story behind this.' After vandall posted the photos the New Philadelphia police department started getting worried phone calls. 'There was a lot of outrage that wanted these people hunted down, prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and should never own a pet. It was pretty ugly on that end,' said Police Chief Michael Goodwin. Goodwin said he had to go to Facebook himself to see what people were calling about.

What's hoing on here?: Ohio residents are worried for the well being of this cat after it was spotted on the hood of this car on Monday . 'It’s definitely strange. Part of my concern was the cat was on a leash and he may have been secured, but if there had been a sudden stop or an impact or something the cat could very easily have fell off the hood of the car and under the wheel of the car,' Goodwin said. 'Twenty-five years here in this city and that’s the first time I have ever seen that. We see a lot of strange things and just when you think you have seen it all, another day rolls by,' the chief added. The director of the Tuscarawas County Humane Society has also expressed her concern over the images. 'The cat can fall off and be dragged or caught in the tire,' Lewis told Fox. 'If the people are found, I would be very curious as to why the cat would be on the hood and would definitely need some kind of warning,' Lewis said. Though both police and the humane society director have said they think it may be tough to make a case for animal cruelty. Vandall says she isn't quite sure what was going on but that she doesn't want to be too quick to judge. 'I feel judging her is not my place, you know? I feel like a cat’s place is not on the hood of a car,' Vandall said.","New Philadelphia, Ohio resident Polly Vandall snapped a photo of the cat on the Buick driven by an elderly woman on Monday .

"A legendary and outspoken Jewish comedian is blasting President Barack Obama – and the Hollywood community – for letting Israel twist in the wind following Benjamin Netanyahu's stunning re-election on Tuesday. In a radio interview set for broadcast on Sunday, Jackie Mason complains that Obama 'doesn't see that Hamas is a problem. ... He doesn't care that they want to wipe us out.' 'I'm not saying he is on the side of the people who literally want to wipe us out,' Mason cautioned, 'but if he's not on their side, it's certainly hard to tell which side he's on. Because you don't hear him attacking the Hamas half as much as he is attacking Bibi Netanyahu.' Mason phoned the Tel Aviv-based Aaron Klein Investigative Radio program from his home in New York City.

A settlement was extended. Two more toilets were added to a certain settlement. And a kitchen was extended on the other side.' 'Between the kitchen and the toilets, that's creating the whole problem,' he fumed. 'And there's too many kitchens and too many toilets.' He said Obama's 'design is to intimidate the prime minister of Israel. ... He wants a peace-making process that will leave Hamas intact and [so] that the enemies of Israel shouldn't be too disturbed.' '""Just because they want to squash Israel or eliminate Israel"",' Mason imagines Obama saying, ""there's no reason why they shouldn't be given a chance to operate"".' The 83-year-old had his claws out for Hollywood as well, saying America's entertainment moguls – even those who are Jewish – tend to be aligned against Israel. 'The truth of the matter is that Hollywood is basically anti-Semitic,' he claimed. 'It's hard to believe that a Jewish organization like Hollywood – Hollywood was created by the Jews and they were the original creators of almost all the major studios of Hollywood. ... Almost every studio is either a partner with a Jew, or a Jew is a boss, or a Jew is involved in it. ... The Jews were always attracted to show business. So what do you think happens?' VICTOR: Netanyahu's Likud party won enough seats in Israel's Knesset to control a governing coalition for another four years – long past Obama's sell-by date in the White House . NO SETTLING: Hamas and other Palestinian factions continue to clash with Israeli soldiers in 'occupied' territories as they object to new housing erected by Netanyahu's government . They've changed their politics, he told Klein, 'as they became richer and richer without working for a living ... Where else do you know a person who is not too bright, and never went to college or went to school and cant talk English and is a total moron or an idiot. And he becomes a star and two minute later he is getting $20 million a picture.' 'Now we expect these people making $20 million a picture who are comparatively retarded – how will we expect them to suddenly make sense when it comes to the state of Israel?' 'When you make this much money for nothing, you feel guilty and you feel like you have to prove you are a humanitarian. So you have to start forming organizations that help the underdog,' Mason said. 'And they convince themselves that the Palestinians are the underdogs.' 'How they became the underdogs nobody knows. But they feel they are being persecuted by the Israelis. Because the Israelis are too successful. And they've done too well. And they can't identify with people who are doing well because they feel guilty for making all this money for nothing so they have to help the underdog.' Aaron Klein's show is broadcast on New York's AM 970 'The Answer' station and on Philadelphia's NewsTalk AM 990.

"Teachers are to get a pay rise of up to 2 per cent, ministers are set to announce tomorrow amid claims of a major coalition dispute. Nick Clegg tonight accused the Tories of trying to block the rise in a 'fierce' row over honouring the recommendation of an independent pay review body to give the full rise to teachers in England and Wales. But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted the salary increase would go ahead as planned. Scroll down for video . Teachers in England and Wales will get pay rises of up to 2 per cent base on performance, the coalition has agreed (file picture) The School Teachers' Review Body (STRB) wants the upper end of the main pay range raised by 2 per cent, while the minimum goes up 1 per cent, allowing schools to reward their best teachers with a bigger rise. At present maximum pay in England and Wales outside of London is £32,187, with the minimum rate set at £22,023. Downing Street this week denied there was a coalition dispute over the issue, insisting it was 'being dealt with in the normal way' by Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander. But Mr Clegg accused the Chancellor of blocking the plan. He told MailOnline: 'It's important that where we can be as generous as we can be… for people who are working in the public sector, we should do so.' He stressed that it was important to be 'responsible with the public finances' but insisted that the teachers' pay rise could be funded. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg revealed details of a 'fierce' coalition row over honouring the recommendation of an independent pay review body to give the full rise to teachers in England and Wales . Speaking this afternoon he said: 'There's quite a fierce debate going on in government right now about what we do for the recommendations for teachers. 'The recommendation is that for some teachers, it depends where they are on their pay band, they get a 2 per cent increase. 'That's being resisted by George Osborne. I just think it's affordable, it wouldn't cost us the earth, it's recommended and we should get on and do it.' He admitted that at a time of ongoing austerity the money 'has to be found from somewhere', but said next week's Budget would focus on raising more in tax from 'people who have got the means to chip in a bit of extra'. However, the Tories hit back insisting there was not row and the deal was agreed this evening. Mrs Morgan told the BBC: 'This country is lucky to have a truly exceptional teaching workforce who do a vital job of opening up young minds. That's I'm delighted to approve a pay deal today which gives heads the freedom to offer their best and most experienced teachers a 2 per cent pay rise, something that is only possible because we trust heads and governors to decide how to reward their staff.' The pay review body believes that the rise for teachers could be made from within existing school budgets, meaning no additional cost to the taxpayer from central government. Chancellor George Osborne is accused of resisting a 2 per cent pay rise for teachers, something the Tories denied tonight . The NASUWT teaching union has warned teaching is already a far less attractive career choice after a series of coalition pay freezes and caps. It urged the pay body to recommend a 'substantial above-inflation pay rise'. General secretary Chris Keates said: 'The cuts to teachers' pay has been a major contributory factor in the current teacher recruitment and retention crisis. 'Many teachers didn't even get the 1 per cent awarded in 2014 thanks to the excessive discretion schools have been given over teachers' pay. 'That is the context in which the argument over 1 per cent or 2 per cent is apparently taking place. It doesn't even scratch the surface of what teachers have lost at the hands of this coalition.'","EXCLUSIVE: Deputy PM tells MailOnline about 'fierce' row over rise .

"Picking up their copy of the parish news, residents of the town of Westhoughton were probably expecting the usual mix of announcements, reminders and perhaps a page or two of genteel religious discourse. Instead they were treated to five pages of a minister ranting about his wife’s adulterous affair. James Wilson, 54, shamed his wife, Alyson, 56, in a 2,000-word article that left many elderly worshippers in shock. James Wilson, 54, churchwarden of St Bartholomew's C of E church in Westhoughton near Bolton, has accused his wife Alyson (pictured together) of having an affair in an extraordinary rant in a parish magazine . Mr Wilson claimed his wife Alyson had committed the 'most heinous' crime of any marriage by leaving him for her ex-police officer boyfriend in the 2,273-word tirade, which he published in the parish magazine he edits . In the piece, entitled Heartfelt Story, Mr Wilson, a lay minister, accused her of conducting an affair behind his back and then abandoning him to set up home with her ex-policeman lover. He begins by telling parishioners: ‘Sadly, I have to report to you, my wife of 20 years recently ended our marriage and not in an amicable or hearty way. I am and have been in quite a mess. ‘She was constantly out till all hours most nights, coming home with flowers, even a teddy bear that went to bed with her and sat on my bed 24/7. This soft pushover ain’t being pushed over anymore.’ The former media sales consultant wrote under the headline 'Heartless Story': 'She would go missing for days at a time. It was blatantly obvious she was having an affair… and she came home from him and got in my bed. 'How cold is that dear reader? It's heartless, cruel and just not on. Talk about rubbing it in my face.' Mr Wilson, who is a lay minister at St Bartholomew’s, a C of E church near Bolton, wrote in the Westhoughton Parish Magazine: ‘I am bereft, numb, angry and disgusted with my estranged wife, a woman I have loved, worshipped and adored for 20 years. Mr Wilson published the rant in the Westhoughton Parish Magazine, which has now been retracted by the church for being 'totally inappropriate' ‘I understand relationships end … but to make the decision on your own, then go and jump into the first bed that comes along is wrong.’ ‘Why I am sharing all this with you? Simply to make you think about your actions that only you choose to do. ‘I can tell you that during my six years as warden to my own knowledge some 11 relationships have ended in adultery from our own church pews. We are supposed to be a beacon of light for Jesus. We are supposed to live life correctly.’ Church leaders immediately recalled all copies of the magazine, prevented any further deliveries and ordered remaining copies to be pulped. Some parishioners in Westhoughton called for the Bishop of Manchester to intervene. One, who would not be named, said: ‘He’s obviously in emotional turmoil. We do feel for him but it was totally inappropriate. The parish magazine has never been so controversial.’ Mr Wilson, who joined the church in 1995, became a church warden in 2008 and runs the church youth club. In 2010 he was made a lay minister and has been editor of the parish magazine for several years. He has been married to Alyson for 20 years and the couple have a son Tom, 18, while Mr Wilson has a daughter, Emily, 28, from a previous relationship. In the article he says: ‘I put a tract on her actions on my Facebook page so all my family and friends found out together. She went mad. She doesn’t like being in the news. So when she gets passed this magazine, I’m sure I will get berated from her. Mr Wilson said his wife Alyson, 56, would sneak out to meet her lover before returning to the marital bed. He said he wrote the five-page rant to parish worshippers because he wanted to 'highlight the impact adultery' ‘But she lost the right to tell me what to do as soon as she jumped into bed with another. She was so wicked to me that I am lost for words. Sadly, dear readers, she is still trying to blame me. No one ever forces you into the arms of another man.’ Mr Wilson - who has another child, Emily, 26, from a previous relationship - said he now 'regrets the turmoil caused' but published the article because he wanted to highlight his wife's alleged cheating. He told MailOnline: 'My intention was to highlight that marriages do break up and cause hurt and that adultery does occur. 'She used to go missing for nights and days. It was pretty clear, she used to bring home flowers and teddy bears. 'She also used to say she was going out for tea with the girls which I know she hated doing. 'The night before she left she finally told me she had met someone else. Mr Wilson, who has two children, claimed the marriage breakdown had taken its toll on both him and the couple's 18-year-old son Tom (pictured together). He blames her for apparently leaving him for another man . 'She has cheated on both her previous husbands as well. But when you fall in love with someone you fall in love warts and all. 'We were together for 20 years and married 18-and-a-half years. In the last few months she spoke to me awfully. 'She's ruined her life and reputation. Our son, Thomas, was 18 yesterday and she only saw him for 20 minutes and all she did was grill him about all of this. 'I want this year to be remembered for Tom's 18th and good things as a family, not for what that woman has done to us all.' Mr Wilson, who joined St. Bartholomew's Church in 1995 and became a churchwarden in 2008, said he is now planning to issue divorce proceedings. He said: 'The church are saying I've brought them into disrepute but I've worked for the parish magazine for 15 years and the majority of my stories have been happy. This is the reality of life and relationships and now I'm being cast as a villain. Mr Wilson, a lay minister at St Bartholomew's C of E church in Westhoughton near Bolton (pictured), described his wife as 'heartless and cruel' and said he was now looking to issue divorce proceedings . 'My whole intention was to help other people in an adulteress relationship. It's the most heinous of crimes to a human being. 'It's knocked me out and it's taken some swallowing. None of us deserved what she has done. 'I had to go to bed at night knowing my wife was in bed with someone else. 'I've lost more than a stone in weight, none of us have been sleeping or eating and my son's college work has suffered.' Mrs Wilson, who works at Debenhams in Wigan, was unavailable for comment last night. A spokesman for the Diocese of Manchester said the church was ‘supporting James Wilson through his personal difficulties. It was totally inappropriate for him to vent his hurt and anger … in the parish magazine.’","James Wilson, 54, wrote five-page rant accusing wife of having an affair .

"Disabled pensioner Alan Barnes has called for his attacker to be sent to jail when he is sentenced this week. Richard Gatiss knocked visually impaired, 4ft 6in Mr Barnes to the ground outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear in a cowardly attack which shocked Britain earlier this year. Drug addict Gatiss will find out his punishment when he comes before a judge at Newcastle Crown Court on Thursday after he pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rob. Scroll down for video . Alan Barnes, who was bundled over outside his home in January, has called for his attacker to be jailed . Mr Barnes today called for Gatiss, who has been kept behind bars for his own safety, to feel the full weight of the law. He told ITV's This Morning: 'He needs to go to prison, because otherwise he might just do it to someone else. Somebody else might get something worse done to them than what happened to me.' The frail 67-year-old, who was born with growth problems after his mother contracted German measles while pregnant, said he didn't believe Gatiss's belated apologies. He said: 'It doesn't [make a difference] because it's easy for somebody to say that but still do it to somebody else afterwards, so I'd like the law to take its course.' More than £330,000 was raised to help Mr Barnes after the details of what happened to him travelled around the world. Today, sitting with local beautician Katie Cutler who organised the fund-raising campaign, he said he would be buying a new house. Legal-high addict Richard Gatiss has admitted the cowardly attack and will be sentenced later this week . Mr Barnes said: 'Half of its going on the house and I'll use the rest for living on. It'll keep us going.' Telling of his joy at moving out of the area in which he was attacked, he added: 'As soon as I got to my feet, it was just plastered in my mind that I can't live here any more.' At a hearing earlier this month, Judge Paul Sloan QC told Gatiss he would continue to be remanded in custody and 'an immediate sentence of imprisonment is pretty well inevitable'. It has previously been said in court that Gatiss was trying to get money to buy legal highs when he tried to mug Mr Barnes. Mr Barnes was shoved over and broke his collar bone but Gatiss fled empty-handed when his victim called for help. Mr Barnes revealed he will use half of the £330,000 raised by local beautician Katie Cutler to buy a new home .","Partially-sighted 67-year-old was beaten in attack which shocked Britain .

"A bridegroom who started a mass brawl on his wedding night by telling three teenage boys he could 'knock them out with one punch' has been jailed for three years. John Derick Sandham, 31, was at his reception at a pub in Holywell, Flintshire, when he launched an attack on a group of young friends also having a drink at the venue. The court heard how Sandham, who had swapped vows with his wife Clare just hours earlier, head-butted one victim before hitting him in the face with a glass or a bottle. John Derick Sandham, 31 (pictured left with wife Clare and right) has been jailed for three years after sparking a brawl at his wedding reception at a pub in Holywell, Flintshire, in August 2013 . Sandham, who had swapped vows with his wife Clare just hours earlier (pictured), launched the attack on three teeangers, head-butting one victim before hitting another in the face with a glass or a bottle . He then grabbed another of the teenagers by the throat, before hitting the third victim on the back of the head, Mold Crown Court was told. It came after he told the trio that he could 'knock them out with one punch'. Sandham had claimed he was acting in self-defence, telling the court: 'This was my wedding night. It is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it was blighted by this.' But he was found guilty of the three assaults and sentenced to the three-year jail term. Sentencing Sandham, Judge Philip Hughes said: 'It was drunken violence against youths who had done nothing to warrant your aggression against them.' The court heard how the brawl broke out in August 2013 while 100 friends and family were marking the marriage at the Abbott's Arms in Holywell, North Wales. The defendant (pictured left and right) had claimed self-defence but he was found guilty of the three assaults and sentenced to the three-year jail term . The victims, who were aged 16 and 17, were not part of the wedding party. The court heard how the incident took place when Sandham went outside at the end of the night to say 'goodbye' to his guests. The defendant walked through the porch, where he was said to have asked the friends - who were 'having a laugh and messing about' - what they were saying. He then walked straight up to the group and grabbed one of them, before launching the furious attacks, the court heard. The brawl unfolded in the porch at the Abbot's Arms in Holywell, Flintshire (pictured), the court heard . The jury heard how one of the teeangers needed hospital treatment for cuts to his nose after being struck with the glass. He told the jury: 'We were just having a laugh. There were no issues. 'He turned around and asked what we were saying? We said we did not want any trouble but he said he could knock all three of us out with one punch.' Sandham, of Bagillt near Holywell, had also claimed that the teenage friends had started growling at him and 'went for him', something which the jury rejected.","John Sandham, 31, married his wife Clare in Holywell, Flintshire in 2013 .

"Police will be barred from leaving suspects to languish on bail for months or even years, Theresa May pledged yesterday. Detectives would face a 28-day time limit which could only be extended under strict rules in the Home Secretary’s shake-up. Her proposals would lead to the biggest reform to police bail in 30 years if the Conservatives win the upcoming General Election. Home Secretary Theresa May pledged to stop police from leaving suspects on bail for months  and said the Tories would introduce rules blocking the extension of bail beyond three months unless magistrates approved . Mrs May’s promise comes amid mounting anger that forces are abusing their powers by keeping people in a lengthy legal limbo – only to decide eventually not to press charges in many cases. There has been an outcry over a string of high-profile cases where celebrities and journalists have been left on bail for long periods, often with strict curbs. Currently there are no restrictions on how long a person can be on police bail. The Tories propose to introduce an initial limit of 28 days. Any decision to re-bail for a total of up to three months would have to be approved by a police officer of superintendent rank or above. Any application to extend pre-charge bail beyond this would have to be approved by a magistrate, said Mrs May. Last year, DJ Paul Gambaccini, 65, told of his ‘12 months of horror and trauma’ at having his name dragged through the mud before being told he would not face historic sex assault charges. Jim Davidson also lashed out at the system after being arrested under Operation Yewtree. The comedian, 61, was kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges. Mrs May said it was wrong for a person to languish on bail without being charged. ‘I have been clear it is simply not acceptable for individuals to spend months, and in some cases years, on pre-charge bail with no system of review only for charges never to be brought,’ she added. Under her plan, there would be a presumption to release a person without bail. Mrs May said it was unacceptable that people like DJ Paul Gambaccini (pictured) had been kept on bail for 'months and in some cases years'. He was told after 12 months that he would not face sex assault charges . Mrs May said: ‘These measures ensure that decisions to release suspects with pre-charge bail conditions are taken only where it is necessary or proportionate.’ But police and prosecutors have warned a limit could hamper complex cases, such as inquiries into fraud or historic sex abuse. Each year, around 303,000 suspects are typically placed on police bail with about 19,600 on bail for more than six months. Police can keep a suspect for 24 hours for questioning after arrest before seeking a further period of detention from a judge. In practice, they often quiz a person then release them on bail to return for interview at a later date. Conditions can apply, such as curfews. In the House of Commons, David Cameron has criticised long bail periods, saying: ‘Justice delayed is justice denied.’ He was responding to a question from Tory MP Michael Ellis who criticised the ‘witch hunt’ by the Crown Prosecution Service which he said meant journalists from The Sun had been ‘put through three years of hell’.","Police will not be allowed to keep people on bail any longer than 28 days .

But because she enjoyed giving to others so much, the first-grader, who has completed 487 acts to date, will have completed 600 acts of kindness by March 22, 2015. Scroll down for video . Alex McKelvey of Washington State started in 2013 with the goal of doing 60 random good deeds to honor and celebrate her grandmother, Linda, instead of mourning (above Alex pictured at one and a half years old with and her 'Nana', Linda) The first-grader, who has completed 487 acts to date, will have performed 600 acts of kindness by March 22, 2015 (above Alex and her mother Sarah pictured while volunteering at the Rescue Mission that provides food and shelter for those in need, her 472nd act of kindness) Alex, and her mother Sarah, had decided to do the first set of 60 acts of kindness in September 2013 after Linda passed away instead of mourning, according Q13Fox. 'We bought coffee, ice cream, donated various things, went to IHOP and left a very cool tip for one of our waitresses, and we ended the day by going on a toy shopping spree for St. Jude's' Children's Hospital,' said Sarah, a caseworker for Greater Lakes Mental Health. She added: 'Alex had so much fun that day, you could see the joy on her face and so we said why not add an extra zero and go for 600?' Alex said that she chose 600 because it was 10 times more than 60, but she dreams of reaching many more people, according to the News Tribune. The young girl said: 'We're going to do thousands, then a million. I'd like to reach so many people.' So far, Alex and her mother have volunteered at food kitchens, given gifts to teachers and staff at school, handed out care packages and candy treats, to given out laundry pots filled with quarters and detergent to people at a laundromat. Alex, and her mother Sarah, had decided to do 60 acts of kindness in September 2013. So far, Alex and her mother have volunteered at food kitchens and handed out care packages and candy treats among other acts of kindness (left, Alex with homemade bath salts for her 342nd act of kindness; and right, after she helped a man who needed money to buy food for her 485th act of kindness) All of the acts of kindness to date have been documented on an Instagram account Alex's mother started (above Alex and Sarah after going on a shopping spree for toys to donate to St. Jude's in the 60th act of kindness on March 22, 2014) 'We're not rich or close to it. But we decided to use our finances a little differently,' said Sarah. 'We're giving up a few luxury things, and we've chosen to live a simple life.' Alex's dad, Army Sgt. Richard McKelvey, has also participated but he said it is mostly the two women in his life who are spreading the good deeds. Together the family most recently repainted the Youth Center at the Lakewood YMCA, and also were able to give the center new board games and a piece of art thanks to their own financial contributions, online donations and contributions from stores. All of the acts of kindness to date have been documented on an Instagram account Alex's mother started with the hashtag 'FORLINDA'. Sarah said that she amazed by Alex's heart and her spirit of giving (above Alex and Sarah pictured on Mother's Day last year) Sarah recently wrote a post ahead of Sunday when Alex will have completed 600 acts of kindness. She wrote: 'Last year it all started by doing 60 acts of loving kindness that we bunched together like coffees and ice creams. 'This birthday we wanted to reach further by doing 61 different acts that day and figured we had better make a list to keep the day organized. 'We are so happy to see so many new followers and Alex loves when I read her all the fabulous and kind comments you have left. It truly makes all our hearts swell with love. 'Thank you to you all for choosing to follow Alex on this journey of loving kindness in memory of her Nana. Much love and stay tuned.' Sarah said that she amazed by Alex's heart and her spirit of giving. She said: 'I think ""if an 8-year-old can do this, why can't anyone?""'","Alex McKelvey of Washington state started in 2013 with the goal of doing 60 random good deeds by her grandmother's 60th birthday last March .

"The mother of one of Bill Cosby's accusers has penned a letter to his wife Camille, pleading for her to speak 'the truth'. Judy Thompson, whose 44-year-old daughter Jennifer Thompson claimed she fended off unwanted advances from Cosby as a teenager, sent the letter to Mrs Cosby three weeks ago. 'It was mother to mother,' she said. 'This letter was written from my heart.' Judy Thompson, who has yet to hear back from Mrs Cosby, said she was inspired to write the letter after she read Camille Cosby's statement issued in December suggesting that her husband, not the women, is the party being harmed by the allegations. Speaking out: Judy Thompson, whose daughter Jennifer Thompson (center) has said she fended off unwanted sexual advances from Bill Cosby, has written to his wife Camille. Her husband Bill is also pictured, right . All smiles: Mrs Cosby, pictured right in November, has supported her husband in the face of the accusations . 'None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim,' Camille Cosby said. 'But the question should be asked - who is the victim?' Judy Thompson bristled when she read the words. She said she watched her daughter go from a sparkling, ambitious teen to a woman 'with an inner light extinguished' after the incident in the 1980s. Only recently has Jennifer Thompson emerged from under 'the dark cloud,' said Judy Thompson, who included a Psalms prayer in the letter. 'Your husband crossed boundaries that never should have been breached,' she wrote to Camille Cosby. 'He shattered her innocence.' Judy Thompson said she prays daily for the Cosbys and ended the letter by writing, 'May you and Bill speak the truth and be afforded peace for your souls.' Mrs Thompson and her husband, William Thompson, met with Bill Cosby in the late 1980s to discuss their teen daughter's modeling and acting career and said they felt immediately at ease. Innocent: Jennifer, pictured as a teen, was an aspiring model when Cosby assured her parents he would take care of her. She says she was pressured into performing a sex act on him - for which he gave her $700 . Emotional: Jennifer, who is now 44, wipes away a tear as she recounts the ordeal in the 1980s . Mrs Thompson said she was inspired to write the letter from 'mother to mother' after Camille Cosby suggested her husband was the real victim in a statement last December. 'Your husband crossed boundaries that never should have been breached,' Mrs Thompson wrote. 'He shattered her innocence.' She added that no one believed her daughter's claims. 'To be so hurt and violated, and then not be believed! Resolution has not been easily forthcoming. We all remained in the shadows of your husband's sick behavior.' Judy Thompson said she prays daily for the Cosbys and included a Psalm in the letter. She ended by writing: 'May you and Bill speak the truth and be afforded peace for your souls.' Cosby reassured the Thompsons that their then-17-year-old daughter would be fine living in an apartment with other models as she launched her career. He promised to help the teen, they said. 'We thought we were talking to Dr. Huxtable,' said William Thompson, referring to the comedian's TV persona in 'The Cosby Show'. Jennifer Thompson now says she fended off unwanted sexual advances from Cosby and once performed a sex act on the comedian. He then gave her $700. She said that she felt he kept pushing her to return to his apartment with him. 'He said, ""And then after the dinner, you can just come back here because you'll be tired""... and I knew right away then - it was clear that this is what had to happen for me to do anything in this industry with him,' she said. The encounter clouded Jennifer Thompson's next two decades. 'It basically shattered my faith so that anything that used to look promising to me, I saw it through a different lens,' she said. Standing up: Judy Thompson, pictured right with her daughter, said she was driven to write the letter to Mrs Cosby after reading her statement in December suggesting her husband was the victim, not the women . Support: William Thompson speaks about the ordeal beside his family at their Spring Hill, Florida home . Judy Thompson said that it was difficult to find anyone, even a therapist, who would believe her daughter's story. She didn't go to police. 'To be so hurt and violated, and then not be believed!' she wrote in her letter. 'Resolution has not been easily forthcoming. We all remained in the shadows of your husband's sick behavior.' Jennifer Thompson was one 13 so-called 'Jane Does' in a 2005 civil suit that was brought by a woman named Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in 2004. Constand later settled out of court and Thompson and the other women did not testify in the case. More than 20 women have stepped forward in recent months to level various accusations against Cosby, ranging from unwanted advances to sexual assault and rape. Additionally, Cosby is being sued by three women for defamation and by another woman who says he molested her when she was 15. Not backing down: Cosby released a 10-second video on Monday, pictured, to promote his upcoming show in West Virginia. He also released a message saying: 'Hey, hey, hey, I'm far from finished' Cosby has not been charged with any crime, and neither Cosby's lawyer nor his spokesman returned calls seeking comment. Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, previously has denied some of the allegations and made no comment on others. On Monday, Cosby released a new video message, his first in months. He doesn't discuss the allegations and in the short video, promoted his Saturday show in Wheeling, West Virginia, the next stop in Cosby's stand-up comedy tour. 'You know I'll be hilarious,' Cosby said in the video. 'Can't wait.' He also added a note to the video, which read: 'Dear fans, I hope you enjoy my wonderful video message that's filled with laughter... Hey, hey, hey, I'm far from finished.'","Judy Thompson wrote a letter 'mother to mother' to Camille Cosby three weeks ago but has yet to hear back .

"A political group pushing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to run for the Democratic presidential nomination is trying to rally people around making her husband the . country's 'first lady.' Bill Clinton occupied the oval office from 2001 to 2009, and the idea of the famous political lothario being called America's 'first gentleman' has made the late-night comedy rounds already. But the 'Bill for First Lady' political action committee is for real, releasing videos, sponsoring social media accounts and hosting . events that feature a walking bobble-head mask . of the former president  – complete with  a red dress and high heels. BUBBA, PART DEUX: Hillary Clinton supporters are pushing online ads and personal appearances by a 'first lady' Bill Clinton as a PR stunt urging the former secretary of state to run for the White House . AVERT YOUR EYES: 'Bill' trades his Barbara Bush-style red dress and high heels for a star-spangled bikini in one video, suggesting how he might appear during campaign stops in South Carolina . The independent group plans to take the live-action comic character to the . early-voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa in support of . Hillary, though she has yet to formally announce her campaign. 'They always said Hillary wore the pants. Now I'm wearing the dress,' the character says in an Arkansas drawl in one online video. 'Put Hillary in the White House. I am homesick.' Another ad features young girls reciting a laundry list of feminist issues Hillary Clinton supports, while encouraging her to get into the race. 'As president, Hillary's experience will impress,' the say, 'but as first lady, Bill will rock the dress.' The ads were developed by Luke Montgomery, the creative force behind a highly controversial 'Potty-Mouth Princesses' video campaign. Americans have never seen a man in the role of 'first lady,' which is a ceremonial title associated with entertaining and promoting social issues. Many are confused about what to even call a husband put into the . traditionally female job. The Bill character's outfit is reminiscent of former First . Lady Barbara Bush's look: a boxy red sheath and shrug, . coordinating heels, blue handbag and belt, and a pearl bracelet. In photos taken at Miami Beach, he swaps the Capitol Hill attire . for a stars-and-stripes string bikini. Hillary's love of trousers led her to jokingly call . her supporters the 'Sisterhood of the Traveling Pantsuits' during her first presidential campaign in 2008. It's her . husband who is infamously associated with dresses – . specifically a blue Gap frock worn by former White House Intern . Monica Lewinsky. 'There's more va-voom in a red dress,' the committee's . campaign manager Luke Montgomery told Reuters about its choice of colors. SHADES OF 'CREEPY UNCLE SAM': The conservative group Generation Opportunity made waves last year with an ad campaign encouraging young Americans to opt out of Obamacare, featuring a giant Uncle Sam character with a disturbing grin . President Clinton recently kidded with television host . Rachel Ray about the confusion over a husband taking the first-lady role, suggesting he might be the 'first man,' or 'I could . be called Adam.' Whatever his title, Clinton will have a tough act to follow . in the sartorial realm if his wife is elected. Current first lady Michelle Obama has planted her flag in the American . fashion world, wearing dresses from top U.S. designers and igniting . crazes for wide belts and the J. Crew brand. The 'Bill for First Lady' campaign aims to collect 100,000 online 'signatures' urging Mrs. Clinton to run. As of 6:00 p.m. Thursday, however, its total was barely 7,000.","Comical Bil Clinton character in red dress and high heels urges Hillary to run for the White House .

"Stopping parliament proceedings for an entire day has been labelled a 'waste of time' by Senator David Leyonhjelm. 'I hope Bob Hawke doesn't die soon, otherwise we'll never get any work done,' the Liberal Democrat told reporters in Canberra on Monday. Mr Fraser, Australia's 22nd prime minister, died on Friday aged 84. Asked by Daily Mail Australia if parliament had gone too far in suspending business for an entire day, Senator Leyonhjelm said: 'Yes we are. The parliamentary agenda is very full. I see no reason why we should lose an entire sitting day.' 'Would it show any less respect if we resumed normal business after condolence speeches? I don’t believe so,' he added. Scroll down for video . 'I have almost nothing positive to say about him. He began his career as a right winger and finished it as a left-winger. He prevented his Treasurer from implementing much needed reforms,' Senator Leyonhjelm said of the late Malcolm Fraser . 'A waste of time'. Senator David Leyonhjelm is unimpressed by the decision to suspend parliamentary business for a full day in order to pay tribute to former PM Malcolm Fraser . Malcolm Fraser was Australia's 22nd prime minister, he died on Friday aged 84. A state funeral will be held for him in Melbourne on Friday . Prime Minister Tony Abbott led tributes to Mr Fraser before parliamentary business is suspended for the day. Senator Leyonhjelm said he had no fond words to say about Mr Fraser, other than he defeated Gough Whitlam in 1975. 'My mum said if you can't say anything good about someone don't say anything at all. So I'll be totally silent today,' he added. 'I have almost nothing positive to say about him. He began his career as a right winger and finished it as a left-winger. He prevented his Treasurer from implementing much needed reforms. His opposition to apartheid was sincere, but he was by no means alone in that,' Senator Leyonhjelm added. The Senator's office confirming to Daily Mail Australia, that he wasn't impressed that a full day of work would because of condolence motions and they needed to be focusing on 'important legislation'. 'This is the last week before a six week recess. Inevitably the government will seek to curtail debate and restrict the ability of the Senate to review legislation. This is not good for democracy.' 'I wouldn’t wish to limit the right of any MP to have a say. However, many won’t say anything and it won’t require a day for it,' he said. Meantime, Liberal Senator Chris Back said it was tragic that Mr Fraser and Mr Whitlam had died within five months of each other. 'They were both mountains of men,' he said. Independent senator Jacqui Lambie spoke at length with Mr Fraser in December about refugees before voting against a government bill for temporary protection visas and fast-track processing. Tony Abbott has led a full day of tributes in Australia's parliament for the late Malcolm Fraser, who died on Friday - the day-long condolences has been criticised by a Liberal Democrat Senator as 'a waste of time' 'To me, the amount of knowledge that he had, that will be greatly missed, especially when it comes to immigration,' she said. Prime Minister Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten have begun the tributes this morning in the House of Representatives. Liberal Zed Seselja said he hadn't always agreed with Mr Fraser, especially in his later years, but there was no taking away his significant contribution to Australia. Asked how Mr Fraser would be remembered in the Liberal Party, the senator told reporters: 'Obviously there will be mixed reviews. Because in his later years Malcolm took a very different view from the Liberal Party on many issues.'","Spending a full day paying tribute to Malcolm Fraser is 'a waste of time' according to Senator David Leyonhjelm .

"Creating an aircraft is no small feat and the Virgin team have captured the process in an impressive three-minute video. Described as evolution in air travel, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner  was created as a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the first ever Virgin Atlantic flight in 1984. The 'Birthday Girl' is shown being constructed: from the building of its shell, to having seats installed ans paint applied; and the video shows the vast team needed to create a plane of this size.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to unleash a supersonic bomber towards Britain which can outrun the Royal Air Force’s fastest fighter jets. The introduction of the Blackjack follows sorties by other Russian aircraft near Cornwall last month which disrupted commercial flights and sparked major security fears. On that occasion, RAF pilots flying Typhoon jets easily caught up with two propeller-driven Bear bombers and directed their crews away from UK airspace. Scroll down for video . The top speed is the same... but our range is less: British Typhoon compared to the Russian Blackjack . The incident led to Russia’s ambassador to Britain being summoned to the Foreign Office to explain the mission. But the Blackjack (Tu-160M) is three times faster than the Bear and can fly four times further than the fighters that make up Britain’s Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) squadrons, according to experts. The bomber, also known as the White Swan because of its shape and huge wingspan, has just re-entered service in the Russian air force following a design overhaul. Experts say it is now more than a match for any UK aircraft, including the Typhoon, which is used to protect British airspace. Like the Blackjack, the Typhoon can reach Mach 2 – about 1,500mph. Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured) has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the West, according to experts . But while the Russian aircraft has a range of 7,600 miles without refuelling, the Typhoon’s limit is 1,800 miles, meaning the Blackjack could maintain its maximum speed for much longer than its British counterpart without air-to-air refuelling. Dr Igor Sutyagin, Senior Russian Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, said: ‘The Tu-160M now has greater thrust and fuel efficiency and it can carry a larger payload of conventional missiles. ‘The test flights were successful and the aircraft is now very potent. There is simply no British aircraft of its calibre or purpose. It is the largest bomber in the world.’ The first two revamped Blackjacks passed a series of test flights last December and have now been passed for service. They are being prepared for possible action at air bases in Russia that are within easy striking distance of Britain. One, Monchegorsk air base near Murmansk, northern Russia, is just 1,000 miles from the British Isles. Ten more Blackjacks will be modernised before 2020. Dr Sutyagin added that the Blackjacks’ revamp was part of a plan by President Putin to boost both Russia’s arsenal of military hardware and its troop numbers. It comes at a time of heightened tension between Russia and the West, and while Britain’s Armed Forces are shrinking due to spending cuts. ‘President Putin has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the West,’ said Dr Sutyagin. ‘He has also improved his long-range nuclear missiles such as the Bulava, which is now very hard to detect on launch. It is lighter and more compact, too, so more warheads can be fitted into a submarine. 'He has also committed to the T-50 low-visibility jet. This stealth jet could lead to potentially massive changes in the distribution of military power around the world. 'He is doubling the number of his Special Forces troops, as well.’ An RAF Typhoon aircraft from Number XI Squadron shadows a Russian Bear-H aircraft (file picture) Between now and 2020, the size of the Spetsnaz (Special Forces) regiments will increase from 15,000 to 32,000. Trained to the same level as Britain’s Special Air Service (SAS), they were used in Chechnya and, most recently, in eastern Ukraine where they are understood to have organised a guerilla campaign by Russian separatists. Experts also believe Putin could send the Spetsnaz to the Baltic states of Latvia and Lithuania, both Nato members, to organise resistance among ethnic Russians. Dr Sutyagin added: ‘Military activity in Crimea and eastern Ukraine has borne all the hallmarks of the special Russian units – it would be a mistake to believe the same tactics might not be applied elsewhere.’ The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been following the Blackjack and Russian stealth-jet programmes. But while the Typhoon cannot match the Blackjack’s range, RAF sources insist it is a superior aircraft overall given its set of air-to-air weapons and its agility. An MoD spokesman said: ‘The primary role of the Royal Air Force is to defend the UK. We are aware of recent Russian military activity. 'RAF Typhoon fighters will continue to routinely intercept, identify and escort Russian aircraft that travel through international airspace within the UK’s area of interest.’","Russian President Putin is about to unleash a new supersonic bomber .

"NHS boss Karl Perryman, 52, was warned he faces jail after being found guilty of stalking female colleague Joanne O'Neill . A senior NHS manager who bombarded a female colleague with poison pen letters after she rejected his advances is facing jail. Karl Perryman was head of complaints and legal services at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in King's Lynn, Norfolk, when he sent the 'dark and spiteful' notes to junior colleague Joanne O'Neill. Posing as a Christian woman, he also wrote to her partner, mother, the hospital and human resources manager accusing her of sleeping her way to the top. Perryman recruited Miss O'Neill as his 'prodigy,' but turned on her when she began a relationship with the hospital's deputy director of ICT Michael Brown, who she has since married. The letters had a devastating effect on 39-year-old Miss O'Neill who left her family and friends as she moved more than 200 miles away to escape Perryman. He was caught when officers found part of one of the letters on his computer. Married Perryman was found guilty at King's Lynn Crown Court of one count of stalking and one count of intimidating a witness - Ms O'Neill's mother Margaret Titmarsh. Miss O'Neill was initially turned down for a job after an interview at the hospital, King's Lynn Crown Court was told. But Perryman  called her afterwards to say he was 'so impressed with her as a candidate that he would do his damnedest to get her a job'. A couple of months later she began working in his department and he promised to 'take her under his wing'. He described her as his 'prodigy' and she soon began covering his job when he was on leave. The two shared friendly 'banter' but the relationship soured when he allegedly purchased a necklace for her from jewellers Ernest Jones and she refused the gift. The first anonymous letter arrived at the hospital in December 2012 and said Mr Brown had been 'bragging' about having sex with Miss O'Neill and another female member of staff. It claimed: 'Both of these women are allowed to dress like hookers in short skirts and dresses… they are dressing like tarts. This is a hospital, not a knocking shop.' Perryman, 52, was the head of complaints and legal services at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Norfolk, pictured, when he turned on his 'prodigy' One said: 'She has had many promotions she does not deserve even though she has been described as next to useless by senior clinicians… one manager even said she is sleeping her way to the top.' A few days later Miss O'Neill received a letter which accused her of 'plotting and scheming' for her own advantage. It warned: 'You will reap what you sow… we will listen to your corridor conversations, when you're in the bathroom, so we can get firm evidence for your partner with what you've done.' Miss O'Neill, who is now married to Mr Brown, told the jury Perryman, who was her line manager, said he would 'destroy' her if she told anyone about his bullying. She said: 'He made me feel like he got me the job, I had to be loyal and I owed him. 'He said there were women who didn't like the way I looked, his wife wouldn't like me because I was just his type, petite and blonde. The court heard police traced the letters to Perryman and found drafts on his computer. After his arrest he allegedly approached Mrs Titmarsh and threatened 'You don't know what's coming to you' while making a 'thumb across the throat' gesture. Perryman was warned to expect jail when he returns to King's Lynn Crown Court, pictured, for sentence next month . After the guilty verdicts, Judge Nicholas Coleman adjourned sentencing until April 17, but warned Perryman to expect to be jailed. He told him: 'I'm quite sure that you will continue to deny the allegations but I am satisfied the jury are entirely right in their decisions.' He added that the only question relating to Perryman's sentence is how long he will be jailed for. Perryman, of King's Lynn, Cambs., stood emotionless in the dock as the verdict was read to him. He was released on bail with a tag and ordered to obey a night time curfew. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital refused to confirm Perryman's employment status. Director of Human Resources Gerry Dryden said: 'The Trust acknowledges the verdict of the court in respect of its employee Karl Perryman. 'The Trust will now carefully consider the verdict and take such steps as it considers appropriate in the circumstances. 'It would be inappropriate for the Trust to comment further on this case at this time.'","Karl Perryman convicted of stalking and witness intimidation by a jury .

"Motorists will get new ‘mini-motorways’ as part of a £15billion overhaul of the nation’s highways. Busy A-roads will be revamped – with roundabouts and traffic lights stripped out – to cut delays and transform them into ‘mile-a-minute expressways’. Details, included in a strategy by the Highways Agency presented to Parliament, also include new slip roads to make the roads flow and banning slow moving vehicles such as tractors and bicycles. New roads: Busy A-roads will be revamped – with roundabouts and traffic lights stripped out – to cut delays and transform them into ‘mile-a-minute expressways’ Up to 18 A-roads are likely to be transformed in the first tranche with seven more to follow. The strategy document says: ‘Our ambition for the next 25 years is to revolutionise our roads. ’Our busiest A-Roads will become expressways, providing improved standards of performance, with technology to manage traffic and mile-a-minute speeds. ‘Users of motorways know they can expect a broadly consistent standard from the whole of their road, and that this ensures they have a safe, free-moving journey.’ But it notes: ‘The same is not true of A-roads, where piecemeal upgrades have often resulted in inconsistency and substandard stretches of the road that are often less safe and a regular cause of congestion. ‘By 2040, we want to have transformed the most important of these routes into expressways: A-roads that can be relied upon to be as well-designed as motorways and which are able to offer the same standard of journey to users.’ 'Vital part of the long-term economic plan': Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (pictured) said the Government is 'investing £15billion in the biggest upgrade to England’s strategic roads in a generation' These will be ‘largely or entirely dual carriageway roads’ that are ‘safe, well-built and resilient to delay. The first group of nine expressways is expected to include the A303 and A30 from the junction with the M3 in Hampshire to Exeter. The A1 north of Newcastle, which motorists have long campaigned to be made into a motorway, is another, as is the A14 from Huntingdon to Cambridgeshire. These will also link with up to 400 miles of ‘smart motorways’ where hard shoulders are used at peak times to reduce jams. A dual carriageway is planned for ‘the entire A303 from the M3 to the M5 at Taunton’, as well as building a tunnel as the road passes Stonehenge. There will also be a new bypass on the A27 at Arundel together with improvements at Worthing and Lancing in West Sussex. Also featuring will be construction of the Mottram Moor link road together with overtaking and safety improvements and duelling the A61 to improve Trans-Pennine connectivity. A range of duelling and junction improvement schemes on the A47/A12 corridor supporting growth at Peterborough, Norwich, Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft is also planned. They will be built so that ‘traffic on the main road can pass over or under roundabouts without stopping’. The strategy document seen by the Daily Mail says: ‘An expressway will be able to provide a high-quality journey to its users. ‘Most expressways should be able to offer mile a minute journeys throughout the day, particularly outside of urban areas.’ The Highways Agency has presented the Road Investment Strategy to Parliament ahead of it being transformed on April 1 into the new private sector roads operator called Highways England. Ministers say the new government-owned company marks ‘a step change’ in how England’s roads are maintained and managed and will be responsible for delivering more than £15billion of investment by 2021. It will have longer-term funding to be able to plan ahead and invest in skills and equipment to speed up essential work. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘The move is part of a radical package of road reform that is expected to save the taxpayer at least £2.6billion over the next ten years.’ Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin added: ‘Infrastructure is a vital part of this government’s long term economic plan to secure a better future for this country, that is why we are investing £15billion in the biggest upgrade to England’s strategic roads in a generation.’ ‘The creation of Highways England will mean better value for money, improved customer satisfaction, more road capacity, improved safety and a better quality of service for millions of people who use the strategic road network every day.’","Revamp of A-roads to transform them into 'mile-a-minute expressways'

"Labour MP Frank Field has complained angrily to Green Party leader Natalie Bennett over claims a Green protester tried to photograph him after he had a heart attack. There were fears for veteran campaigner Field’s life when he collapsed at a rowdy meeting in his Birkenhead constituency last weekend. Field, 72, recovered after being taken to hospital. But Labour supporters claim Green activist Colin Dow tried to photograph him as he lay on the floor unconscious waiting for an ambulance. MP Frank Field has complained to Green Party leader Natalie Bennett over claims a Green protester tried to take a photograph of him after he had a heart attack . ‘To take a photo of someone who has just had a heart attack would be a despicable thing to do,’ Mr Field told The Mail on Sunday. ‘Some members of the Green Party are the kind of people who infiltrated the Labour party in Merseyside years ago. We got rid of them and some have resurfaced in the Greens. This kind of behaviour has no place in public life. ‘Everyone thinks the Greens are cuddly and fluffy but the truth is very different. It is high time Natalie Bennett denounced them.’ The incident occurred during a meeting hosted by Mr Field to discuss plans to sell-off of the site of Rock Ferry High School. Green activists, including Mr Dow, led protests. ‘Had I been closer, I would have taken a picture,’ Colin Dow said . Mr Field said: ‘I told the police I did not want the protesters to force the meeting to be stopped. I was happy to continue. Later, I felt chest pains and collapsed.’ Mr Dow, a former Labour party member, last night confirmed he took his camera out when Mr Field collapsed but was told by a Labour councillor not to take a picture. He said he complied but denied he was being ‘insensitive’ as it was a public meeting. ‘Had I been closer, I would have taken a picture,’ he said. He claimed others present did take photographs, and he hit back at Mr Field on his Facebook site, challenging the former Labour Minister’s ‘imagined version’. He said the MP behaved ‘insultingly’ towards protesters.","Labour MP Frank Field complained to Green Party leader Natalie Bennett .

"Women are big fans of the latest fitness fads to help us stay in shape, and now a new video has captured exercise trends from the an entire century in just 100 seconds. The YouTube film, starring an energetic professional dancer, showcases fitness fads and movements from the 1910s to the current day. And the clip has already attracted almost 12,000 views since its launch five days ago. Created by Benenden wellbeing services, the video is intended to shed light on the changeable nature of women's exercise. The UK fitness industry is worth £4 billion and growing, with a record 13.2 per cent of the population belonging to gyms, but the landscape of female fitness has dramatically changed from 100 years ago. A new YouTube video showcases fitness fads and movements from the 1910s to the current day, starting with the gentle stretches of the 1910s which were used to improve the hips and even ease constipation . Ten years on and women had moved on to more dynamic stretches, often while wearing silk night gowns . The Women's League of Health and Beauty aimed to bring fitness to the masses in the 1930s . Travelling through time, decade by decade, 100 Years of Fitness begins with a look at the gentle stretch exercises favoured in the 1910s and 1920s: a time when perspiration was seen as 'unfeminine.' The hula hoop and twister fads of the mid-20th century are also featured. The video ends with the biggest fitness movement of the millennium, Zumba. The 1940s saw an early form of sit-up as a 'sweat reducing' excercise . The hula hoop was an almighty craze in the mid century but also provided a form of exercise . The Trim Twist was an exercise board popular among Sixties housewives and office workers . Jazzercise was introduced to Seventies fitness fans by former Broadway star Judi Sheppard Missett . A spokesman for Benenden, says that we often unaware of how long the notion of keeping fit has been around: 'Keeping fit didn't begin with Lycra and aerobics classes. Both sexes have been keeping themselves in shape in different ways for centuries, so this showcase of the past 100 years is Benenden's own tribute to the passage of time.' Eighties-style aerobics is a high energy cardiovascular exercise that is still popular today . Tae Bo combined taekwondo and boxing and was popular ahead of the millennium . Fitness through dance returned in the form of Street Dance in 2000s . Zumba has remained a favourite over the past five years for its fun approach to fitness . 1910s: Women's main form of exercise was comprised of gentle stretches that were said to improve the hips and, believe it or not, ease constipation! 1920s: Fitness costumes included silk nightgowns. 1930s: The genteel Women's League of Health and Beauty aimed to bring fitness to the masses. Its motto: 'Movement Is Life.' Members attended group classes and wore black shorts and white satin vests. 1940s: Sweat-reducing exercises were the order of the day, including an early form of sit-up. 1950s: The hula hoop took centre stage, promoted as an exercise tool! Who knew you could have so much fun while burning calories? 1960s: The Trim Twist, a square of pressed board on top of a metal turning mechanism, was a hit with housewives and office workers alike. 1970s: Former Broadway star, Judi Sheppard Missett, introduced Jazzercise! This combination of aerobic exercise and jazz dancing was designed to slim and tone, and is still practised in 32 countries today. 1980s: Day-glo leotards and big hair dominated. High-energy aerobic routines and high kicks provided an intense cardiovascular workout. 1990s: Billy Blanks, an American taekwondo instructor, brought Tae Bo to the nation. His exercise trend combined taekwondo and boxing. 2000s: The decade in which fitness through dance returned. 'Street dance' passed through school yards and local neighbourhoods into dance studios and gyms. 2010s: Fitness is more fast-paced than ever. Zumba incorporates elements of hip-hop, soca, salsa, samba, merengue and mambo. It feels more like a trip to a nightclub with friends than an effort to get fit.","A new video reveals women's fitness developments over the past century .
Early forms of exercise were used for alternative health benefits as well as fitness, including squats to ease the symptoms of constipation .

"This is the terrifying moment a boiler explodes in a child's playroom, leaving toys and debris scattered all over the place. Anne-Marie Faiola, 37, from Bellingham, Washington, said her four-year-old son Jamisen had just left the room before the freak accident occurred last Friday afternoon. Footage caught on a baby monitor camera shows the eruption take place, with a wall suddenly imploding and smoke filling the air. Fire alarms start sounding as a thick fog fills the room. Faiola, who owns a soap-making supply company, said she was driving home when she was informed about the explosion by her nanny. The childminder told her over the phone that she heard a ticking and bang, before seeing smoke coming out of the vents. Both of Faiola's children, who were not in the room at the time, were evacuated from the house by their nanny and father. Firefighters then attended the scene to check it was safe to re-inhabit.

Alarming news: Faiola, who owns a soap-making supply company, said she was driving home when she was informed about the explosion by her nanny . Apparently the gas levels inside the home were too high. One fireman told Faiola that if anyone had tried to cook anything, the entire house would have been 'leveled.' Commenting on the event, the mother-of-two wrote on her blog: 'Thankfully, instead of blowing up like a rocket ship, the force of the blast took it sideways into our storage area, and not directly up into Lily’s crib - her room is directly above the boiler. 'We’re focusing on that and the feelings of thankfulness, and how lucky we are, rather than the dull monotony of all the next steps. 'We are safe. Our house can be fixed.' Faiola made the video of her gas explosion public to serve as a warning to others to check boilers regularly. The cause of her home blast is currently under investigation . Safe from harm: Both of Faiola's children, who were not in the room at the time, were evacuated from the house by their nanny and father (above, the Faiola family) Fallout: The boiler was ripped from its foundation and launched 15 feet across the room .

"The way we walk is unique when compared to our closest living relatives, the ape. But scientists are not sure when our skeleton evolved to create this distinction, which is one of the questions driving the study of human evolution today. Now, researchers believe the answer could lie in our big toes. Scientists have developed a new method of analysing long bones, such as the hallucal metatarsal - the shaft of the foot bone that links to the big toe - in order to study differences between the feet of humans and apes. The method shows structural differences in different colours, as shown above . An interdisciplinary team led by scientists at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, has combined visualisation techniques, engineering principles and statistical analysis into a  new way of analysing the structure of long bones. They used it to document foot differences between humans and apes, so that variations were highlighted in a rainbow of colours. This work will be the starting point for future studies, which could investigate how far back in our evolutionary history the modern human pattern of bone structure in the hallucal metatarsal – the shaft of the foot bone that’s connected to the big toe - emerged. Scientists are not sure when our skeleton evolved to create our unique walk, but they believe the answer could lie in our big toes, which we use in the propulsive phase of walking, unlike apes which use it to climb and grasp. A computer graphic showing a version of the March of Progress is pictured . Podiatrist Christopher Hunt claims that the condition of our feet can indicate health problems. They are composed of 26 major bones and joints and the way humans walk depends on the way they move in relation to each other. Beacuse of this, flat feet can indicate curvature of the spine and distorted toes can signify rheumatoid-arthritis later in life. 'A slow pulse can signify poor circulation and, for example, rolling ankles - a condition where ankles roll inwards - can show incorrect posture, which can lead to severe back pain,' he said. Returning red ulcers could indicate diabetes, which affects 1.4 million people in Britain, while discoloured feet could hint at circulatory problems. As well as offering crucial evolutionary insights into the timing and appearance of modern human gait, they believe the method will advance the study of bone biology in hominin fossils. They focused on the hallucal metatarsal in groups of modern humans, gorillas and chimpanzees, because the big toe, or hallux, plays a pivotal role during the propulsive phase of walking and running in humans. In other living apes, the big toe is more thumb-like so it can be used for grasping and climbing. Their method, which is described in the journal Plos One, allowed them to detect differences in the shape and size of the bone in the modern species, by creating images from CT scans to make a ‘colour map’ where different qualities and properties of the bone are shown in different colours. Dr Kristian Carlson explained: ‘This study is an exemplar proof-of-principle analysis for a technique that can advance the general fields of bone biology and functional morphology by introducing a powerful new means of analysing long bone shafts, particularly their structural properties. ‘In our first study, we have documented exciting structural differences between humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, some of which were predictable based on their gait differences. ‘The unexpected structural differences we observed are equally intriguing. We are eager now to begin examining how far back in evolutionary time these differences can be traced.","Researchers from the University of the Witwatersrand developed a new technique to analyse the shape of bones in feet .
They have used it to show the structural differences between the feet of humans and apes in different colours, which may explain the way we walk .
They say the method could one day reveal when our skeleton evolved to make us walk differently from our closest living relatives ."
"One is a figure of fun who convinces himself he is still loved by the nation by hosting eccentric phone-ins on local radio. The other is Alan Partridge. Nick Clegg today showed how his conversion into the comedy character has stepped up a gear with the unveiling of a bright yellow mobile radio studio almost identical to one used in the hit film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa. The Lib Dem leader is to tour the country in an election battlebus fitted out with a radio studio to allow him to continue his regular broadcasts designed to drum up support before May 7. He will hope to avoid the fate of Partridge in the 2013 movie, which saw the DJ accidentally shoot himself in the leg on Cromer pier. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg posed in the doorway of his yellow battlebus, echoing Steve Coogan's appearance as Alan Partridge at the premiere of the 2013 film Alpha Papa . The bright yellow Lib Dem battlebus will tour marginal seats across the country as Mr Clegg tries to prevent electoral wipeout on May 7 . Mr Clegg's bus bears a striking resemblance to the Radio Norwich mobile radio van used by Partridge . The Lib Dem vehicle has even been fitted with a radio studio to allow Mr Clegg to continue broadcasts. In the film Alpha Papa, Partridge is take hostage by DJ Pat Farrell and they continue their broadcast on the road . Mr Clegg is pinning his hopes of survival on wooing women in key parts of the country. The Lib Dems claim that a drop in undecided voters in selected marginal seats has coincided with a rise in support for their party. Today he appeared with his battlebus in Abingdon, part of a key marginal seat the Lib Dems are hoping to win back from the Conservatives. Party officials said that Mr Clegg's battlebus has been fitted with a satellite radio transmitter so that he can do interviews and radio phone-ins while he is on the road. Since January 2013, the Deputy PM has hosted Call Clegg on LBC, answering questions from listeners ranging from the political to the personal. Conversations about where he buys his underpants, wearing a onesie and  the price of diesel could have been lifted straight from a Partridge script. In the film Alpha Papa, Steve Coogan's character is taken hostage by sacked fellow DJ Pat Farrell and they continue their broadcast on the road using the bright yellow roadshow truck.

The Lib Dem vehicle is decorated with abstract images by two graphic design students and the slogans 'stronger economy, fairer society' and 'opportunity for everyone', in contrast with 2010's campaign bus which featured prominent photographs of Mr Clegg and Vince Cable. Addressing activists today Mr Clegg took aim at both the Tories and the Labour party, ahead of the election on May 7. He warned that leaving the European Union would be an act of economic 'self harm' and said it was 'stating the flaming obvious' that the UK needed to be at the heart of Europe. He said he was 'dismayed' by Ed Miliband's failure to spell out details of when he would balance the nation's books. Mr Clegg lent a helping hand to putting up election boards for local candidate Layla Moran . Mr Clegg said: 'Of course we have different views to the Conservatives. I'm the leader of the Liberal Democrats, David Cameron is the leader of the Conservatives. 'They have a completely different attitude towards Europe. They have this hokey cokey where one day they want to leave, the next day they don't want to leave. 'We are unambiguous as a party that says 'yes, Europe needs to be reformed, yes there needs to be a referendum when a decision needs to be made about the transfer of powers to the European Union, we guaranteed that in law'. 'We are not like the Conservative Party, half of whom are straining at the leash to leave. We think that would be a terrible thing for the British economy. 'But in the same way I strongly disagree with Ed Miliband and Ed Balls's failure to spell out when they would actually balance the books. I am dismayed the Labour Party want to borrow GBP70 billion more than we think is needed.' He added: 'Of course it would be an economic act of self harm to leave the European Union. 'Large parts of the Conservative Party and Ukip appear to want Britain to cut itself off from what is the world's largest marketplace with hundreds of millions of customers for British goods and services. 'For me it's stating the flaming obvious that we need to secure Britain's presence at the heart of the European Union in the same way it's flaming obvious that we should secure the British economic recovery by finishing the job of balancing the books but doing it in a fair and sensible way - not taking an ideological approach to cuts, which is the Conservative approach, nor taking such an irresponsible approach to borrowing, which is Labour's approach.' Lib Dem strategists believe that winning over the female vote will be crucial to their chances of success across a range of key battleground constituencies. The Tories have often been accused of having a 'woman', with support much higher among male voters. The latest YouGov poll for the Sunday Times shows 33 per cent of men plan to back the Conservatives, compared to 31 per cent of women. For Labour it shows 35 per cent men, 36 per cent women. But for Lib Dems, just 6 per cent of men plan to vote for Mr Clegg's party, rising to 9 per cent among women. Mr Clegg warned it would be an 'economic act of self harm' if Britain were to leave the European Union . The Lib Dems point to internal polling which suggests women voters coming over to them in a series of must-win seats . They point to internal polling which suggests women voters coming over to them in a series of must-win seats.

Over the same period they say that support for the Lib Dems in those seats has risen from 15.2% to 24.9 per cent - an increase of 9.7 per cent. They say younger women particularly are attracted by their policy on shared parental leave, while headline plans to prioritise mental health, raise tax thresholds and cut the deficit are popular among women generally.","Lib Dem launches campaign with visit to Oxford West and Abingdon .

"The baby girl cut from her mother's stomach by a Colorado woman was not born alive, as it is revealed the suspect faces more than 100 years in prison after being charged with attempted murder. Investigators found no trauma or injuries to the baby girl, whose mother was seven months pregnant, according to Boulder County Coroner Emma Hall. Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, was charged with attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy on Friday. Hall said there was no evidence the unborn child survived outside of victim Michelle Wilkins' womb. Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said his office would not seek a murder charge against Lane, according to KTLA. Scroll down for video . Dynel Catrece Lane (above), 34, was charged with attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy on Friday . Victim Michelle Wilkins, 26, was released from hospital on Wednesday and her family said she is taking the first tentative steps in a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation . Under Colorado law, a person can be charged with murdering a baby only if there is evidence the baby was alive outside of the mother's body. 'At this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb,' said Hall. 'Therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth. 'No evidence of trauma or injuries were found on the body. Final autopsy results will be released once all testing and further studies are complete.' Garnett said final results on the cause of death will take six to eight weeks, and he said the coroner's conclusion that it was not a live birth precluded the filing of murder charges. Lane was also charged with two counts each of first and second-degree assault. She faces eight criminal counts and up to 48 years in prison if convicted of first-degree attempted murder, and up to 32 years on each of the other charges of assault and unlawful termination of pregnancy. Lane (above) faces more than 100 years  in prison and is currently being held in jail on a $2million bond . Wilkins, 26, was released from hospital on Wednesday, according to Times-Call. Her family said they are aware of the charges that were announced by the district attorney's office in a statement on Friday. Following her release from the hospital, they said she is taking the first tentative steps in a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation. They also said Michelle believes her recovery is directly aided by the prayers and positive energy she is receiving. Wilkins had moved to Colorado and just started a job teaching pottery classes. On March 18, she answered a Craigslist ad for baby clothes in a suburban neighborhood of Longmont, about 30 miles from Denver. She was glassed in the neck and then attacked with a small knife in the basement, allegedly by Dynel Lane. The suspect then fled with the baby, who was found by Lane's husband, taking her last breath's in the bathtub. Lane reportedly told her husband that she had suffered a miscarriage and he took her to hospital with the baby. The accused attacker told hospital staff she had suffered a miscarriage but later admitted her atrocious deed. On March 18, Wilkins (above) answered a Craigslist ad for baby clothes when she went to Lane's home and was glassed in the neck and was attacked with a small knife . Family Statement . March 25, 2015 . Today marks a week since the brutal attack that nearly cost Michelle her life and ended that of her soon to be born baby Aurora. She is now out of the hospital in a safe location and accompanied by her partner Dan, is taking the first tentative steps along a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation. She is surrounded by friends and family and wishes to express her deep gratitude for all the expressions of love, kindness, and spiritual solidarity she has received from both the Longmont community and from around the world. Michelle believes her recovery is directly aided by the prayers and positive energy she is receiving. We cannot predict what lies ahead for Michelle. We have no guidebook on how to navigate this crisis, or a checklist on what to do next. We wish there were. What we can say is that we have all been deeply moved by the many people who have reached out to Michelle and her partner to share their own personal stories of tragedies they’ve endured and how they managed to first just survive and then eventually start to heal. That alone has given us the strength to get up and face each day. You’ve touched our hearts and souls and we thank you so much. For the many members of the media who have reached out to us, we thank you for your continuing interest in Michelle’s well being and the civility that has marked almost all the reporting. We hope you understand our continuing desire for privacy as we try and regroup, pull our lives together, and focus on Michelle’s well-being and recovery. There may be a time in the future where she chooses to share her story, but now is not the moment. Source: GoFundMe . Around 2.30pm, Miss Wilkins managed to make a 911 call as she lay bleeding out on the basement floor. During the desperate six-minute call, she faintly told the dispatcher: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.' The police officers who found her, Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski, described finding Wilkins weak and in a state of shock. 'I started yelling and Michelle yelled back, very faintly, and it was muffled — ""Help me! Help me!""' Sawyer told KTLA this weekend. He described finding her covered from head to toe in blood. 'So I put some gloves on and held her hand and went through where her injuries were … trying to figure out exactly what we had,' he said. Piotrowski believed that Miss Wilkins was the one who 'saved her own life.' 'She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,' he said. The situation was so bad that he had to leave the room for a moment to compose himself. Lane was arrested at Longmont United Hospital (above) after first telling hospital staff she had suffered a miscarriage but later admitted her atrocious deed . The case has revived the highly charged debate over when a fetus can legally be considered a human being. Even though the baby girl died, legal experts say the situation is complicated by the fact that Colorado is one of 12 states that do not have laws making the violent death of an unborn child a homicide. State legislators in 2013 voted down such a measure over fears it would interfere with abortion rights, and voters overwhelmingly agreed when they rejected a similar ballot measure in 2014. Advocates say the attack shows the need for a fetal homicide law. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for May 5 and Lane remains held in jail on a $2million bond.","Dynel Lane, 34, was charged with attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy on Friday among other charges .

She said: 'Wherever they are, they need to know where the other is. Even at nursery surrounded by all their little friends, they are constantly looking to see where the other one is. 'If I'm getting Ruby dressed first, Rosie will run off, find the exact same outfit and pester me until I dress her exactly the same. It's been like that ever since we brought them home. 'They used to crawl around the house chasing one another. Normally Rosie will learn something first - like talking - and within a week Ruby will have caught up - they're just little copycats really.' Mrs Formosa was only 16 weeks pregnant when a scan revealed to her and taxi-driver husband, Daniel, 39, that the twins were conjoined. Together: Ruby and Rosie, who were born with the same intestine in July 2012, are 'inseparable' The couple, who also have a seven-year-old daughter, Lily, prepared themselves for the worst as doctors gave the girls a small chance of survival as they couldn't definitively see where the connection was. Conjoined twins occur every 200,000 births, however, as few as five per cent of those births actually survive being born. Mrs Formosa, a full-time mother, said: 'Hearing the girls were conjoined was the shock of our lives. 'I'd heard of it, but I never expected it to happen to me. I was nervous the whole way through the pregnancy but tried to shut it to the back of my mind. 'When I heard their two little cries when they were born, the worry subsided, but only for a while.' Almost immediately after being delivered by caesarean section at University College Hospital, London, Rosie and Ruby were whisked off to Great Ormond Street Hospital to be operated on. They were delivered at 34 weeks and weighed 5lb 3oz each and the following day they were operated on to clear a life-threatening intestinal blockage. 'Those were the most difficult 24 hours of our lives,' Mrs Formosa added. 'Having my babies taken off my almost immediately after they're born and not knowing if either would survive was heartbreaking. 'When the doctors came out to say the surgery had been a success and that the girls were both fine, it was like the world had been lifted off our shoulders. Complications: Rosie, left, and Ruby, right, were born joined at the abdomen and shared part of the intestine . Sisters: The girls spent a few weeks in hospital before returning home to be with their big sister Lily (centre) 'Seeing their little bodies in two separate cots, instead of one, I just burst into tears. I was so happy.' Mrs Formosa and the girls spent another four and a half weeks in hospital to make sure they were healthy enough to go home. The couple say that even when they were given the all clear they still weren't full prepared to bring both girls home so everything was a 'bit last minute'. 'On the drive back we had to buy bottles from Boots. During the pregnancy I couldn't see us getting to the point where both our little girls would survive.' Toddlers: The identical twins love to dress in matching outfits (left) and playing on their scooters (right) The girls go to nursery five days a week and their recent report card says they are 'getting on just fine' The girls only had a small chance of survival as few as five per cent of conjoined twins' births actually survive being born . Occasionally Rosie and Ruby, who attend nursery five days a week, have to have routine operations, but even those minor setbacks aren't stopping their development. Mrs Formosa said: 'They've both developed as any ""normal"" child does. We were always a bit worried that them being conjoined could delay that, but it doesn't seem to have done. 'Their report card from nursery says they are getting on just fine. The only problem we have is that Rosie and Ruby keep doubling up on their big sister Lily so they can steal her toys.'

Celebrating their first year: Ruby (left) and Rosie (right) are pictured on their first birthday in July 2013 . Today: Rosie (left) and Ruby (right) are fit and healthy two-year-olds and love to double up on their big sister . Conjoined twins are two children physically connected to each other at some point in their bodies. The lowest odds of this happening are 200,000 to one for every live birth and around 70 percent of conjoined twins are female. Conjoined twins are always the same sex and the form of conjoined twinning refers directly to where they are joined. The most most frequent are horacopagus (heart, liver, intestine), omphalopagus (liver, biliary tree, intestine), pygopagus (spine, rectum, genitourinary tract), ischiopagus (pelvis, liver, intestine, genitourinary tract), and craniopagus (brain, meninges). (American Pediatric Surgical Association) Experts think that conjoined twins come from a single egg that fails to separate. Around 200 conjoined twins are born each year and around half die before their first birthday. Veena and Vani, ten, were born joined at the head, but their parents left them in their local hospital in Hyderabad, India because they could not pay their medical expenses. For eight years the girls have eaten, played and slept in one room at Niloufer Hospital and have been cared for by nursing staff. They cannot be separated. Their doctor, Dr Narendra Kumar, a paediatric surgeon, is trying to find an international surgeon who specialises in neurology to perform the operation. He said: 'It has always been possible to operate on the girls because they both have individual brains. 'The problem lies with the one main blood vessel they share so it does have its risks.' Laleh and Ladan Bijani caught the attention of the world when at the age of 29 they decided to have surgery to separate. The sister's skulls were joined above the ear but each of their brains was intact. They were never able to look into one another's face without the aid of a mirror. Their dream was to walk out of Raffles Hospital in Singapore and walk in opposite directions. Sadly they both died after their surgery. Born in Tehran in 1974, they developed different personalities and made separate groups of friends. Ladan was the stronger personality and was more talkative, while Laleh was quieter. So when Ladan said she was determined to become a lawyer, Laleh had no choice but to study law with her. Conjoined twins Shivanath and Shivram Sahu caused quite a stir when they were born in India, with some people in their village worshipping them as divine incarnations. And while one doctor has said that it would be possible to separate the 12-year-olds, who were born joined at the waist, the duo are determined to remain together. Shivram said: ‘We don't wish to get separated. We will stay like this even when we grow old. We want to live as we are.’ The pair, who were born in a tiny village near Raipur in central India, share two legs and four arms and work in tandem to get around. They have stunned doctors with their ability to wash, dress and feed themselves. A local doctor told the family they were both healthy but he could not separate them. They are believed to share the same stomach but have independent lungs, hearts and brains. With practice they have learned to do all their basic daily chores with minimal fuss, including showering, eating, getting dressed and combing each other's hair. They are able to walk down the stairs of their simple split-level home and even run on all six limbs to play cricket and other games with neighboring children.","Rosie and Ruby Formosa were born sharing the same intestines in 2012 .

"On the face of it, bubbly Oghosa Ovienrioba is a 22-year-old with a bright future ahead of her. A pretty and intelligent Law Graduate, Oghosa is also a popular vlogger to boot. But Oghosa used to hide a dark secret: she was addicted to online pornography. Scroll down for video . Law graduate and vlogger Oghosa Ovienrioba, 22, began watching porn at age 14 and was soon a fully-fledged addict, watching more than 400 hours in total . It was an addiction that first kicked in when she was just 14 years old and sneaked a look at online porn on her computer. And from the ages of 18 to 21, she would lock herself in a dark room and watch adult movies endlessly. At her worst point, Oghosa would masturbate between five and six times a day - and watched a total of over 400 hours of adult material . But now Oghosa has become a hero to other sufferers after bravely speaking out about her porn addiction on YouTube - in a series that has amassed over 800,000 hits. Oghosa, from London, says, 'When I uploaded that video in February, I had no idea how phenomenal the response would be. 'I received hundred of heartwarming comments from women who were going through the same thing for years. 'Lots of people don’t think girls can suffer a porn addiction but it’s a problem for both sexes. I hope I can help others out there - talking about your problem is the first step.' At her worst point, Oghosa (in a still from one of her YouTube videos) would watch films for hours every day . Oghosa, who began watching online pornography in 2006, says that it was dangerously easy for her to access. She said: 'I was 14 years old when I went to find porn on the internet. It was out of curiosity and it was just a simple Google search for me to get hold of an adult movie. 'When I first watched it, my reaction was shock. But gradually over time, that shock becomes excitement and I would use any porn that I could get my hands on.' Her habit started to become a worrying obsession by age 16 when she began watching adult movies as often as she could. She said: 'I was watching it so much that I started to get bored by the ""normal"" soft porn movies. 'I wasn't getting the buzz that I felt when I first saw it - in fact I was almost desensitised to that content. 'I went from watching soft pornography to dodgier stuff to get the kick I needed.' Oghosa's addiction briefly stopped when she had a six-month relationship with a boy at age 18. But when she started university and found herself single again, the downward spiral of her addiction recommenced. She said: 'I was at a university and alone in a new city. I guess it was a trigger and I just went downhill from there. 'For a period of two to three years, I was watching porn on a daily basis and sometimes masturbating over six times per day. It was all I could think about.' 'I didn't see people as people anymore - they were just sex objects to me,' admitted Oghosa . She continued: 'I didn't see people as people anymore - they were just sex objects to me. 'The simplest things could set me off such as a girl unbuttoning her blouse or a boy taking his top off. Everything made me want more. 'I would sit in my room alone for hours, with the lights off, watching porn. I felt lonely and ashamed of myself.' When Oghosa turned 21, she found Christianity and knew it was time to confront her problem. She made several lifestyle changes so she would not return to old habits again. She says: 'I spoke to a friend about my addiction and that was a huge release for me. It was a first step. 'Talking about it made me realise how much of a problem it was - you're only as sick as the secrets you keep. 'As a Christian, you have to be quite controlled about what you let into your heart, in terms of what you see and do.' When Oghosa turned 21, she found Christianity and knew it was time to confront her problem. Now she doesn't read sex scenes in books and tries not to listen to oversexualised music . She continued: 'So now, I don’t read sex scenes in books and I don’t listen to oversexualised music. 'There are some artists that just sing about sex and it’s best to avoid that, I also try to avoid inappropriate programmes on TV late at night.' As part of her recovery process, she posted a YouTube video in February 2014 in which she revealed her porn addiction to the world. The response from viewers was overwhelmingly positive. She explains: 'When I read some of the comments on that video, it brings a tear to my eye. People have told me how alone they felt with their addiction until they saw my video.' Oghosa believes that there should be age restrictions on online pornography to make it less available to children. 'It’s heartbreaking to know that children can still access pornography so easily like I did. There are age restrictions on drinking and smoking - the same should go for porn.' A spokeperson for The Marylebone Centre of Psychological Therapies said: 'The internet is having a huge impact on human sexuality as an infinite variety of material is available through picture sites, chat rooms, live shows, bulletin boards and web-cams. 'Internet sexual addiction is a form of sexual addiction and it is important to have someone to talk to about your feelings in general.'","Law graduate Oghosa Ovienrioba, 22, began watching porn at age 14 .

"Parents are allegedly using ice to pay their teenage babysitters in the Northern Territory, as the drug problem in Australia's top end continues to worsen, according to a new report. Allegedly, the prevalence of methamphetamine use, more commonly known as ice, is now so severe in Darwin and Palmerston that youths are reportedly babysitting and prostituting themselves in exchange for the drug, according to The NT News. Authorities are now referring to the abuse of ice in the Northern Territory as an 'epidemic'. A shocking report by Australian Crime Commission has revealed that children as young as 11 are starting to experiment with the hard drug. Parents are allegedly using ice as currency to pay their teenage babysitters in the Northern Territory . Some teens are so hooked to the drug ice they reportedly accept it as payment for babysitting (stock photo) Allegedly, the prevalent of methamphetamine use, more commonly known as ice, is now so severe in Darwin and Palmerston that youths are reportedly babysitting and prostituting themselves in exchange for the drug . Ice use has escalated at an alarming rate amongst 15 and 16 year olds over the last six months, according to Catholiccare – Northern Territory's only service focussed on targeting drug abuse in young people. 'Addiction to ice is placing young women in vulnerable situations and leaving them open to exploitation, further the easy accessibility of ice means that it is used as a form of currency,' Ms Lloyd said.'Catholiccare's NT Director Jane Lloyd told The NT News. However, the federal funding is scheduled to stop for Catholiccare on June 30. Ms Lloyd partially blames the widespread use of ice on the affordability of the drug. She also labels ice 'the drug of curiosity' amongst young people and the problem is a result of experimentation resulting in addiction and abuse. As a result of the surge in hard drug use, crime is also beginning to escalate in the region, according to Catholiccare. Authorities are now referring to Ice use in the Northern Territory as an 'epidemic'. It is popular in struggling areas because it is so cheap but has been found to lead to a rise in crime . 'It has been used as a tool – kids are easily manipulated and used in many ways and ice is one of many tools that is being used,' Catholic Care NT's Alcohol and Drug urban team leader Yianna Paterakis told NT News. A new Australian Crime Commission (ACC) report has revealed that ice poses the greatest risk to users and the wider community. Two weeks ago, a parliamentary committee was formed to crack down on the ice epidemic in the Northern Territory. Chief Minister Adam Giles confirmed that 'this committee will be tasked with looking at all the evidence and determining if there are ways we could be responding better to this issue.' The focus will be on determining the extent of the problem and evaluating the current programs in place to target drug use.

"You may be mystified as to why your phone’s battery can drain in a matter of hours. And while mobiles have a large number of adjustable settings which can be tweaked to prolong battery life, they are often tricky to understand. Now there’s a free app that offers users personalised advice about how to boost their phone’s battery life. A free iOS and Android app called Carat offers frustrated smartphone users personalised advice to boost their phone's battery life. A screenshot showing distribution information is shown left, and a J-Score, which indicates how a device’s battery life compares with others running Carat, is shown right . Called Carat, it uses crowdsourced measurements to work out how much of an impact certain settings and apps are having on a specific battery, before advising users what to do. After using their phone normally for around a week, people who download the app will start to receive personalised recommendations for improving battery life. This is because the app intermittently takes measurements about the device and how it is being used. These measurements are sent to Carat’s servers and ‘thrown into a statistical stew’ so that the measurements can be used as a benchmark to compare how power-hungry a certain device is. Carat uses crowd-sourced measurements (illustrated) to work out how much of an impact certain settings are having on the battery and what users can do about it. Users who download the app can use their phone normally, and after  a week, will start to receive personalised recommendations for improving their battery life . Carat analyses a specific phone's energy use, drawing upon crowd sourced information. It offers users recommendations on how to boost the battery life of their device. For example, it might point out that Twitter is using an unusually large amount of power compared to on other phones, indicating that either an individual is hooked on the social media app, or that it could contain an energy-sapping bug. An ‘action list’ is shown on the main screen of the app, with instructions such as ‘Kill App X’ or ‘Upgrade OS’ along with an estimate of how much battery life will improve if a user takes the recommendation. A J-Score is also given that indicates how a device's battery life compares with other Carat users' devices. A Hog Report section advises which apps to close, while a Bug Report section points out those that are in a bad state. Non-identifiable information from phones is collected to build up the main database used as a benchmark for energy consumption. The results of the analysis are then sent back to the app, in order to give users instructions on what to do to improve the life of their phone. For example, it might point out that Twitter is using an unusually large amount of power compared to on other phones, indicating that either an individual is hooked on the social media app, or that it could contain an energy-sapping bug. An ‘action list’ is shown on the main screen of the app, with instructions such as ‘Kill App X’ or ‘Upgrade OS’ along with an estimate of how much battery life will improve if a user takes a recommendation. ‘The information displayed by Carat changes over time as it learns - the longer you use it, the better the results get,’ according to the researchers behind the app. Users will also see a ‘J-Score,’ which indicates how a device’s battery life compares with others running Carat. It's expressed as a percentage, so a J-Score of 75 means a device has a better battery life than three out of four smartphones - and users can get a score for a comparable model too. Apps listed under the title of ‘Hog Report’ are shown to be energy-hungry and closing them could result in battery  life. Similarly, Carat lists some apps under ‘Bug Report,’ which are associated with increased energy use on an individual user’s phone. ‘In other words, it may be that your instance of the app is caught in a bad state or has a bad configuration,’ the researchers behind the app wrote. Apps and settings listed under the title of ‘Hog Report’ (shown left) are shown to be energy-hungry and closing such apps could result in battery life. The confidence level (shown right) indicates how likely it is that closing an app will make a difference to battery life . ‘Restarting the app may help if it's a transient problem, but, if not, you may need to close and avoid the app.’ As well as being a tool for consumers, Carat is a research project run by computer scientists at the Universities of Helsinki and University of California, Berkeley. ‘We want to know whether it is possible to take sparse, incomplete measurements from a large community of mobile devices and figure out which apps are abusing the battery,’ they said. ‘We want to find bugs and simultaneously help users mitigate their ill effects and help developers fix them. While it's relatively easy to find a link between energy consumption and screen brightness and connectivity, the experts are unravelling the energy impact of the combination of roaming, high operating temperature, and bad signal strength, for example. Recommendations could lead to less charging (stock image) While it is relatively straight forward to find a link between energy consumption and screen brightness and connectivity, the experts are unravelling the energy impact of the combination of roaming, high operating temperature, and bad signal strength, for example. The researches have so far found that Wi-Fi signal strength dropping one bar can cause 13 per cent battery loss, and high temperature can cause 50 per cent battery life loss, even if the heat doesn’t come from the CPU inside a smartphone or tablet. Automatic screen brightness is in most cases better than the manual setting and together, battery temperature and distance travelled,. offer a good predictor of battery lifetime. ‘We believe that, as our dependence on mobile devices increases, energy bugs will rise to prominence, and we want to begin developing tools and techniques for detecting and fixing them.’ Their research is based on a large dataset that currently consists of device usage data gathered from more than 150,000 smartphones and tablets. It covers life daily usage patterns and, together with laboratory based specific high precision measurements, serves as the basis for the research work.

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in northern Syria have carried out another mass cigarette burning, as the terror group steps up its anti-smoking campaign. Photographs taken in the northern town of Barqah, close to the border with Turkey, show members of ISIS' feared religious police force setting light to vast piles of cigarettes in a field. The images emerged as it was revealed ISIS has erected shocking anti-smoking posters throughout its self-declared caliphate featuring images of burning human lungs, in the hope it will convince militants to reject the 'slow suicide' caused by cigarettes. Scroll down for video . Up in smoke: Photographs taken in the northern town of Barqah, close to the border with Turkey, show members of ISIS' feared religious police force setting light to vast piles of cigarettes in a field. Flames: Petrol is seen being poured over the boxes of cigarettes, which are then set alight . Shocking: The cigarette burning images emerged as it was revealed ISIS has erected shocking anti-smoking posters throughout its self-declared caliphate featuring images of burning human lungs . Images of the mass cigarette burning have been widely shared by ISIS supporters on social media. The terror group has ruled that smoking cigarettes causes cancer and is therefore a form of suicide. Taking your own life is deemed a major sin by ISIS and failed attempts - or in the case of cigarettes 'slow' attempts - are considered comparable with murder. Despite this many fighters continue to regularly smoke and abandoned ISIS positions are often found littered with cigarette butts - suggesting a thriving black market exists in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under the militants' control. To counter this, ISIS appears to now be relying less on threats and punishments to convince militants to give up smoking, and more on using similar shocking images of cancer victims that now appear on packets of cigarettes in the West. In typical ISIS fashion, however, the terror group took the method to its logical extreme, showing grisly images of lungs being set alight to symbolise the damage smoking does to a human body. Getting ready: The photographs of the cigarette burning in northern Syria show members of ISIS' notorious Hisbah religious police force using huge planks of wood to prepare a bonfire .

Petrol is then seen being poured over the boxes of cigarettes, which are then set alight and burst into flames while the chilling black banner of the Islamic State flutters in the wind nearby. Once the fires have been extinguished, the landscape is seen littered with vast piles of burnt cigarette packets. Delivery: Several lorries are seen arriving at the site and countless cartons of cigarettes are unloaded - the cargo presumably having been confiscated from local black market salesmen . Remains: Once the fires have been extinguished, the landscape is seen littered with vast piles of burnt cigarette packets . Last November it was revealed that a French jihadist fled ISIS after just two weeks when he decided he would rather face jail in his home country than put up with the terror group's strict ban on smoking. Flavien Moreau, 27 was the first French citizen to be tried for joining ISIS and was sentenced to seven years jail by a court in Paris. Moreau, who has 13 previous convictions ranging from armed robbery to assault, is a Muslim convert. He moved to Syria in 2012 to join ISIS after becoming radicalised in France. But he returned to France just two weeks later, unable to cope with the strict ISIS regime, and was swiftly arrested. Moreau told the court: 'I really struggled with not smoking... It was forbidden by the katiba. I had brought Nicorette gum with me, but it wasn't enough. I left my gun with my emir and I left.' French intelligence officials remain concerned about the number of French nationals involved with ISIS. It is believed at least 930 are actively fighting in Iraq and Syria.","Hisbah police members burnt cigarettes in a filed near the town of Barqah .

"Hillary Clinton has been accused of ignoring official advice issued by her office while Secretary of State against using private email addresses by using her own server housed in her New York home. The leading Democratic presidential hopeful has faced criticism for using her @clintonemail.com email address for official government business, especially during the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the US consulate based in the Libyan city of Benghazi. According to leaked diplomatic cables, the State Department warned employees against using their own private email addresses for official business. Scroll down for video . Hillary Clinton, pictured, advised State Department staff against using their own private email accounts for official business despite hosting her own email server in her New York home leading to security fears . Clinton held the server at her Chappaqua home in New York, pictured, according to Internet registry records . In the memo, which according to Fox News, was unclassified, State Department officials were advised to 'avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts'. They were also warned against using 'auto-forward' tools to channel emails to their own accounts. Clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department following the revelations. The cable advised State Department officials that 'online adversaries' had attempted to hack into the private email accounts of its employees. The June 2011 advice contained in the cable only applied to 'sensitive but unclassified' information. This could include personal information of State Department officials or members of the public, business secrets, plus ongoing investigations or records about visa or asylum applications. The cable was signed Hillary Clinton, but it is not apparent whether she was aware of its content as many official memos would bear her name if she was in Washington at the time. Fox News contacted an unnamed computer hacker as part of its own investigation into the Clinton email issue, who used a publicly available tool called 'The Harvester' to determine how many email addresses Clinton used while at the State Department. According to the hacker: 'Given the sequential similarities to hdr22@ I suspect some others found by my search may also have been used by HRC. 'I suspect hdr18 -hdr21 may have been used by HRC as well as h@clintonemail.com and hillary@clintonemail.com....I’d also be interested to learn if there were ever hdr1@ thru hdr17@.' Clinton's staff maintained that the former Secretary of State only used the one email address, understood to be hdr22@clintonemail.com. Clinton has been forced to hand over 55,000 emails as a result of a House of Representatives investigation into the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, pictured . White House press secretary Josh Earnest was questioned on Hillary Clinton's email policy . However, the hacking expert claimed several slightly different email accounts existed, which may have been used by the Democratic hopeful. Clinton's critics fear she has been able to control what information will be made public as she will have control over the data. Under the Freedom of Information Act, the government can censor or withhold emails to protect information that would hurt national security, violate personal privacy or expose business secrets or confidential decision-making in certain areas. It wasn't clear whether the State Department would automatically apply those provisions to its review of Clinton's emails, or use its discretion to release even emails that might be covered under those exemptions. Withholding emails merely because they might be embarrassing or expose government incompetence or malfeasance is not permitted under the act's guidelines. More than 11,000 people have sought access to Clinton's emails under the Freedom of Information Act since the use of a private system has been revealed.","Hillary Clinton warned State Department staff against personal email use .

"A teenager who revealed that his father slammed his coming out as 'worse than death' in horrific online messages told Daily Mail Online on Monday that he had not spoken to him since the exchange. Tyler, 15, received an outpouring of support globally after he uploaded two photos of his Facebook conversation with his father - which took place last December - to his Tumblr account. In the messages, his father apparently wrote that the news his son is gay is an 'embarrassment', he has been left 'shamed' and 'ridiculed' and he feels like he is 'going to puke'.

Above, the teenager is seen (right, at the back) several years ago with his father, mother, and two sisters in a family photo . The teen said the support he has received following the 'physically painful' Facebook conversation has lifted his spirits and helped him think positively, adding: 'I have no time for tears.' Tyler, whose  mother and two  sisters still live with his father, said: 'I haven't heard from my father at all. I moved out to my aunt's house a few weeks after he sent the messages. 'He sent them a week after I came out during December, and I haven't spoken to him since then. The rest of my family were kind of blown away by how much attention [the photos] have drawn. 'I initially just posted them in anger and disappointment to my Tumblr blog because that is usually where I vent and rant about stuff. I never thought that it was going to [escalate] like this.' He added: 'I visit my mom and sisters whenever my dad is at work.' The teenager said he had known he was gay 'since fifth grade', but had been worried about coming out publicly - particularly because his relationship with his father had been 'rocky for a long time'.

Above, Tyler, his mom (right) and two other women . Tyler told the news to his sisters first, who were extremely supportive. Then, he came out to his mother, who was shocked, but ultimately supported him. Eventually, he told his father. But instead of responding to Tyler in a loving manner, the father apparently sent a series of offensive Facebook messages to his son, reading: ‘We took care of you since you were a baby. 'We loved you, took care of you when you’re sick. Lost many days and nights in all your fifteen years. Now this is what we get in return, shame and embarrassment. 'If only you didn't reject God and His teachings in your life you could have been strong enough to stay from evil and scums that surrounds you. Stay away.' In further messages, perhaps in response to the Tumblr post - which Tyler initially posted in December before it went viral this month - he added: 'Take out your post from social media. 'You embarrass me from all the people I knew. I'm going to puke. Whatever you do it reflects on me. People will ridicule me, insult me, and I might turn out to be a criminal.' Despite his father's reaction to his coming out, Tyler told Daily Mail Online that all of his other relatives - including the aunt with whom he is staying - and friends were 'supportive and non-judgmental'. 'Even the friends that I thought were going to shun me out accepted me,' he said. In relation to his feelings about his father's reaction, Tyler added: 'I honestly don't have time for being sad. 'I mean, I'm on Spring Break and I have to finish a math booklet and a French speech. [I have] no time for tears. I'm just hoping that that my father will come around.' Supported: Despite his father's reaction to his coming out, Tyler (pictured in online photos) said all of his other relatives - including the aunt with whom he is staying - and friends were 'supportive and non-judgmental' 'Be proud'; On Monday, Tyler re-tweeted a series of supportive messages from strangers and friends alike . The teen was applauded for his bravery by users on Twitter, with one saying: 'Always stay true to yourself' He added that the outpouring of support from people across the world has been 'just amazing', saying that it has made his blog post 'more meaningful' and could help others in his situation. He said his mother and older sister 'have mixed feelings' about the attention his post has brought, but his younger sister 'doesn't really mind' because she 'doesn't really know what's happening'. One of the messages of support the teenager has received reads: 'Mate, from the other side of the Atlantic, be proud of how you are born. Hope everything comes around with your dad.' Meanwhile, a Twitter user named Katerina told Tyler: 'Your father is ignorant and he needs some education on many matters, bc I suppose he is not so narrow minded only regarding this.' Another, named Naithom, posted: 'I'm so sorry for the way your dad's handling the situation. Please surround yourself w/ people who love & care for you as you are.' 'You are brave': Strangers reached out to him on the social network, offering words of advice and support . 'Love from NC': Mom-of-three Sarah MckKee, from North Carolina, said 'a parent should love unconditionally' Disappointed: On his blog post, alongside the images of his and his father's Facebook exchange, Tyler wrote the words: 'My dad’s reaction to me coming out. Can’t even say it to my face smh (shaking my head)' And Marshall Moore told the teenager: 'Just read about your story. Different generation but I still get it. Stay strong and please don't give up on yourself. Love wins.' Mr Moore added in a separate online post: 'Every time I see a story like this, I foam at the mouth. The world should've moved on by now. Obviously it hasn't.' Pensioner Jacqui Christensen also spoke out in support of Tyler, saying: 'I'm a 75 year old woman, mother to three children. Be proud of who you are. What your father is saying is so unfair.' She added: 'People choose to have children. Caring for them is part of the deal. Parents should respect who that child is; what he becomes.' Tyler and his younger sister were born in Vancouver, while their older sister moved to the city with their parents from the Philippines when she was three. Two of their aunts later moved to the city. Tyler's mother works in the packaging department at a health supplement factory. His father is also employed, but his job is unknown. His sisters are believed to still be in school. On his  blog post, alongside the images of his and his father's Facebook exchange, Tyler wrote: 'My dad’s reaction to me coming out. Can’t even say it to my face smh (shaking my head). This is terrible please find someone in your life who cares, they’re there I promise.This physically hurts to read.' On his Twitter account, the teenager has posted two pictures of himself and his boyfriend, one of which is captioned: 'mom tells me not to be so public with my bf.

"A religious cult that isolates followers from the 'evil' outside world has defended its practices after a family of 14 fled declaring they had been living in a 'false system'. James Ben Canaan walked out on the Gloriavale Christian Community, located in Haupiri on New Zealand's west coast, suddenly at the weekend with his wife Hope and 12 children. The commune, who refused to go into detail about the Ben Canaan family's sudden departure, hit back at the family's accusations arguing that it was 'entirely their choice to leave', the New Zealand Herald reports. Scroll down for video . Children dressed in Cooperite clothing walk at Gloriavale Christian Community located at Haupiri on New Zealand's west coast . Children at the school in Gloriavale Christian Community. The community, founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members . 'No one is here against their will. We only want people who want to be here,' Fervent Stedfast, a Gloriavale member since 1970, said. 'We're here simply and entirely because we want to be here.' It comes as the daughter of Gloriavale's leader, Neville Cooper, spoke out for the first time since leaving the remote community about her struggles to reintegrate in the 'outside world'. Miracle left the cult, which forces people to wear the same uniform and bans birth control, five years ago with her husband and 10 children, 3News reports. Miracle said there was no doubt the Ben Canaan family would struggle like she did to integrate into society. 'Making a decision to come on the outside you leave with basically the clothes on your back,' she said. 'I think the biggest struggle is at our age - I was 45 - and to start life from scratch, normally you would have built up a life from a young age. 'The struggle is just so hard. 'You don’t know any obligations to renting a home, opening bank accounts. You don’t even have a birth certificate or driver’s licence – or any identity to even be able to do those things.' The Ben Canaan family, who are among a number of large families to walk out on Gloriavale in recent years, are now staying 300km away in Timaru. Miracle, daughter of Gloriavale's leader, Neville Cooper, has spoken for the first time since leaving the remote community five years ago about her struggles to reintegrate in the 'outside world' The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control . James and Hope Ben Canaan have since forsaken their nun-like headdresses and white bibs to put on everyday clothes, while their children have removed their hooded hats and blue uniforms. 'It's a huge deal for them to stop wearing their community clothes and so they are going to transition slowly,' Liz Gregory, who has offered the family of 14 her home, told the New Zealand Herald on Wednesday. The father, who managed the commune's self-sufficient dairy farm for 20 years, is now looking for a job. Ms Gregory said the family had 'come to believe they were in a false system and left 500 of their family and friends (the only ones they've every known).' 'They are hugely courageous…they are very excited about starting life out here,' she said. 'They are feeling blessed, but are aware of the road ahead of them.' Ms Gregory told the Herald that the family, who do not want to make any public comment, was in great spirits 'which is incredible, because what they have done (walking out) is massive.' Gloriavale, which was established about 45 years ago, does not condone the use of birth control and it is common for a married couple to have 12 or more children. The community, founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members, is headed by Neville Cooper, known to the families as 'Hopeful Christian'. But it has been revealed that he was convicted of sexual abuse in 1994 and spent 11 months in jail.

The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control. One young couple were married after just six weeks of courtship. Their website states the couple 'make vows to God and each other before the Church, for no preacher can 'marry' them'. The marriage procedure is as follows: 'Then they go to a private place pleasantly prepared for love-making. As they consummate their marriage before God, He joins them together in a bond that only death can break.' 'They return as a married couple to a wedding feast with the rest of the Church.' The cult has several sources of income which includes dairy farming and deer farming.

"A man has been charged with the murder a Food Network star and her husband. Cristie Codd and her husband Joseph of Leicester, North Carolina, were reported missing on Sunday, and now police have charged Robert Jason Owens with two counts of first degree murder, one count of murder of an unborn child, breaking and entering, and larceny after breaking and entering. Cristie, who was a competitor on the eighth season of the show Food Network Star, was five months pregnant. Cristie Codd and her husband Joseph (above) were reported missing on Sunday, and on Monday it was revealed the couple had been murdered . On Tuesday, Robert Jason Owens (above) was charged with killing the couple and stealing jewelry, a computer and a Glock from their home . The couple had been using Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home (above) Fox Carolina reports that authorities believe Christie, 38, and Joseph, 45, were killed on Thursday, and that Owens returned to the couple's home on Sunday and ran off with their 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun' Police have yet to comment on how the couple were killed as their bodies have not yet been discovered. Their cars and two dogs were found at their home. Owens, who is being held without bail, appeared in court on Tuesday where he requested an attorney and his next hearing was scheduled for April. He had also been a suspect in the disappearance of 18-year-old Zebb Quinn in January 2000, a case that remains unsolved. The couple had been using Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home. They were both set to leave for work on Sunday, with Cristie catering on a movie set  and Joseph heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production. It was a very big movie set for Cristie too, as she had just announced her company, Tree Hugger Catering, would be providing food on the set of The Big Short, starring Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell.

As for playing at their wedding, he said; 'He made sure we were taken care of. They brought us over a cooler of beer. Just a great couple.'

"Lancashire Police chiefs  found ‘no evidence’ that attempts to bring Cyril Smith (pictured) to justice were blocked . A police force accused of covering up Cyril Smith’s crimes faced claims of a ‘whitewash’ last night after it cleared itself of blame. Lancashire Police chiefs declared they found ‘absolutely no evidence’ that attempts to bring the paedophile Liberal MP to justice were blocked. The internal inquiry contradicts claims by retired detectives that key evidence was ‘locked away’ and they were silenced. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, whose book about Smith’s sordid double life sparked the investigation, last night accused the force of a whitewash. He said there is a ‘mountain of evidence’ that Smith was a paedophile and serious failings had allowed him to ‘get away with his crimes for years’. ‘It is very disappointing that Lancashire Police are unable to accept this and are now trying to rubbish the claims of their own former officers,’ Mr Danczuk added. ‘This shows that we haven’t learned lessons from the past and a culture of cover-up and denial still persists.’ The outcome of the inquiry will raise questions over whether it is appropriate for police to investigate themselves in such cases. Yesterday, the independent police watchdog revealed it is overseeing 14 claims of cover-ups and corruption by Scotland Yard in historic sex abuse cases. The London force will also investigate itself. MPs want Prime Minister David Cameron to guarantee police whistleblowers will not be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act if they come forward. Scroll down for video . They said ex-officers, public officials and spies may hold vital information that could open up suspected powerful networks that protected abusers. Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday insisted spies and police will not face prosecution under the Official Secrets Act if they give evidence to the police or the Home Office’s abuse inquiry. MPs want Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) to guarantee police whistleblowers will not be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act if they come forward . She has invited Justice Goddard, who is leading the inquiry, to seek confirmation from the Attorney General that no charges would be brought. However, when pressed by the Home Affairs Committee, Mrs May declined to extend the protection to whistleblowers who speak to the media or elsewhere in public. Police suspect Smith’s activities as a paedophile could be key to unlocking claims of an Establishment child sex ring. The politician abused children at care homes and schools in Rochdale and Manchester. He was also seen at the notorious Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south-west London, where appalling crimes are said to have taken place involving young boys. Jack Tasker, a former Lancashire detective, who led one of three investigations into Smith, said it was stopped because it could have led to the ‘fall of the Government’. Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) insisted spies and police will not face prosecution under the Official Secrets Act if they give evidence to the police or the Home Office’s abuse inquiry . He claims his 1969 inquiry into abuse at Cambridge House care home was stalled by Special Branch officers who confiscated his notes and ordered him to forget the matter. ‘We were under the impression then that they’d take the investigation over … but I never heard any more about it,’ he told Sky News. He added: ‘Other people were rather worried that if Cyril Smith went before a court, he would open his mouth.’ Another ex-officer, Tony Robinson, said he had advised Lancashire Police to look at the case file he found locked in a Special Branch safe in the 1970s. ‘It doesn’t surprise me at all that they’ve dismissed the claims,’ he said. ‘It’s an easy way out.’ A Lancashire Police spokesman said it had referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission which ‘determined that a local investigation be carried out’. He added that the Constabulary’s Professional Standards Department found ‘absolutely no evidence to substantiate any of the claims’.","Lancashire Police had been accused of covering up Cyril Smith's crimes .

"A train passenger was brutally attacked by a gang of thugs after he refused to let them try on the top hat which has become his 'trademark' because he wears it every day. Jacky Pautonnier was returning home from a dinner party when he was accosted on the train platform by a man pestering him to try on his hat. When he refused, the yob went and fetched two friends, who followed him onto the train and beat him unconscious before stealing his beloved headgear. Assault: Jacky Pautonnier was left with horrific injuries after he was attacked by thugs on a train . Horrific: Mr Pautonnier, a French e-cigarette seller, refused to let one yob try on his 'trademark' top hat . Mr Pautonnier, 56, had to undergo reconstructive surgery to repair multiple fractures on his face after the horrific assault, which took place last month on a train between Catford and Charing Cross in London. The French e-cigarette salesman said: 'It's awful. I have been so sad without my top hat. We had spent the day eating cheese and I was tired so I went home alone. 'I was wearing my top hat and this guy carrying bags of spirits pestered me on the platform. 'The guy said, ""Hey mate, can I try on your top hat?"", but the way he asked me wasn't very nice. Usually it wouldn't be a problem but I said no and he wasn't very happy.' Ten minutes later, the thug returned with two friends, and they taunted him again on the platform then boarded the same train as him. Surgery: Mr Pautonnier had to undergo an operation to repair the damage to his face . Injuries: The victim's skull was fractured in three places around the eyes and nose . 'The three guys sat behind me and started to tip my hat and I said, ""Can you stop please?"" but he came and sat next to me,' Mr Pautonnier said. 'Then I got up and one of the guys pushed me against the carriage door and said, ""You are getting on my nerves, why won't you let me wear your hat?"" 'I tried to calm him down but I blacked out here, I lost consciousness.' The father of two woke up at Charing Cross in a pool of blood before taking the Tube home to Canada Water in south-east London and going to sleep. When his partner Jennie Allen arrived home she convinced him to go to hospital, where X-rays revealed that he had fractures below his left eye, on his nose and on the top of his left eye. Gruesome: The scene on the train after Mr Pautonnier was beaten up and left unconscious . Suspects: Police are trying to speak to these three men over the assault on Mr Pautonnier . Mr Pautonnier, who is president of the Association of London Normans, bought the hat for £45 in 2008 from the Sherlock Holmes Museum in Baker Street after his son Alex said it suited him. Alex, now a 24-year-old chef in London, convinced his father to wear it to work the next day and Mr Pautonnier went on to make a habit of it. 'I wore it to work and everybody commented that it suited me,' he said. 'I've worn it ever since and it has become my trademark. 'I feel sad without it. I've got another one but it's just not the same.' British Transport Police released surveillance camera footage of three men they wish to talk to following the assault but are yet to make any arrests. Investigating officer Stephen Allen said: 'I am keen to speak to the men in the CCTV images as they may hold vital information to my investigation and I urge them to come forward.'","Jacky Pautonnier, 56, was returning home from a dinner party last month .

"‘My wrist had started to get uncomfortable, so I decided to get it checked out,’ said Lucy Norman . As she looked at the piece of paper in front of her, Lucy Norman massaged her fingers and puzzled over the spidery, illegible writing. As a personal assistant, she relied on her ability to take accurate, concise notes and was proud of her neat handwriting. Yet the words she’d just written were no better than a scrawl. ‘I’d start writing as normal, but within just a few words, it would fade into little more than a scribble,’ says Lucy, 42, who lives in Barford St Michael, Oxfordshire, with her husband Angus, 64, an engineer. ‘It was as if my hand would just stop working. ‘I’d also been having trouble typing, hitting the wrong letters — previously, I’d been able to touch type accurately at high speed.’ Initially, Lucy blamed the problem on tiredness from long working hours and her commute into Central London to work at an energy company. But after six months of suffering these symptoms, she made an appointment to see her GP. ‘My wrist had started to get uncomfortable, so I decided to get it checked out,’ she says. ‘At the time I was 36, so I didn’t suspect anything sinister, but I couldn’t ignore something that affected the skills that were so intrinsic to my work. 'If I couldn’t write or type, how could I continue to be a PA?’ Her doctor diagnosed repetitive strain injury (RSI) in the wrist, caused by typing and writing over 20 years, and told her there was nothing they could do. ‘I accepted the diagnosis without question,’ says Lucy. ‘It seemed to make perfect sense given my line of work.’ RSI is an umbrella term for pain in the muscles, nerves and tendons caused by repetitive movement and over-use. It is extremely common — research shows as many as 73 per cent of people who use a computer at work experience it, with an estimated 200,000 cases of work-related musculoskeletal complaints in the hand, wrist, arm, elbow, shoulder and neck last year alone, according to official statistics. Typical RSI conditions include carpal tunnel syndrome, where a nerve in the wrist becomes compressed. Other common causes include tendonitis (inflammation of a tendon) or tenosynovitis (inflammation of a tendon sheath). Lucy began to experience tremors in her leg 18 months after being diagnosed with RSI. ‘I’d also started having difficulty with simple tasks, such as brushing my teeth, so I began to get concerned,’ she said . Since there is no test for RSI, diagnosis is usually made on the basis that the condition developed following a repetitive task and is relieved by resting from it. But experts warn that the term RSI is increasingly being used as a blanket diagnosis, and could mask other more serious conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), diabetes and even Parkinson’s disease. That’s because the early signs of each of these conditions are so similar to RSI that doctors often consider it first. For example, with diabetes, long-term poor management of blood sugar levels (often because the condition hasn’t been diagnosed) can lead to tingling, numbness and pain in the fingers — all symptoms of RSI, too. ‘The term RSI is really very vague,’ says Professor Tony Kochhar, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon. ‘Because it covers such a wide range of ambiguous symptoms, it is easy to see how doctors can attribute them to the condition when they are, in fact, indicative of something else entirely. ‘The most common are rheumatoid arthritis and MS, but it could be a different neurological condition, such as Parkinson’s, or diabetes.’ ‘The consultant seemed to be taking it far more seriously than 18 months previously,' said Lucy . He says that when RSI is suspected, and particularly where there is pain but no sign of injury, such as inflammation, swelling or problems with nerve function, this should be the starting point of investigations to pin down the root cause. ‘I don’t think that to simply identify that a patient has pain and accept it as a condition in its own right is helpful,’ says Professor Kochhar, visiting professor of sports science at the University of Greenwich. He says that once the specific cause has been worked out, each individual condition that may be put under the umbrella of RSI is ‘absolutely treatable’. ‘However, the term “RSI” is so nebulous, treatment is very varied depending on the root cause of the pain. In fact, I think the term should be banned. ‘The key is getting an accurate diagnosis, with all therapists and doctors working together to treat the problem, rather than just accepting it.’ Lucy’s was a classic case of RSI misdiagnosis. After seeing her GP, she tried her best to ignore her symptoms, typing more slowly to maintain her accuracy and using a ruler to keep her writing straight. But 18 months later, she began to experience tremors in her leg, so returned to her GP. ‘I’d also started having difficulty with simple tasks, such as brushing my teeth, so I began to get concerned,’ she says. After walking and writing tests at the GP surgery, she was immediately referred to a neurologist at the Nuffield Hospital in Warwickshire, near where she lived at the time. ‘The consultant seemed to be taking it far more seriously than 18 months previously, but they still didn’t give me any indication of what it could be,’ says Lucy. She was sent for an MRI scan on her brain, which was normal. A week later, she had a DaT scan, which determines the level of dopamine in the brain — this chemical plays a vital role in regulating movement. Lack of dopamine is characteristic of Parkinson’s disease, causing tremors, slowed movement and stiff, inflexible muscles. The DaT scan confirmed that Lucy did have Parkinson’s, and she was put on medication to slow the progression. But four years since her correct diagnosis, she has had to give up work. ‘I can’t write very well or type any more, and I tend to stammer and drop things, but I can honestly say I have a better quality of life,’ she says. ‘Before, I was working long hours and felt permanently stressed — now, I can spend time with my husband and relax and enjoy life. ‘I’m chairman of our village hall committee and run a Saturday food market, which keeps me busy. 'My symptoms are very mild and progressing very slowly, so I consider myself lucky.’ 'My symptoms are very mild and progressing very slowly, so I consider myself lucky,’ said Lucy . Lucy also insists she has no anger or animosity towards the GP who misdiagnosed RSI. ‘It’s notoriously difficult to diagnose Parkinson’s in its early stages — and even if I had been diagnosed earlier, it’s unlikely it would have made any difference to the progression of my illness. It’s an easy mistake to make.’ Indeed, it can be difficult for any GP to pick up on the wide variety of symptoms of Parkinson’s, says Professor David Burn, a neurologist and clinical director of the charity Parkinson’s UK. The problem is that many of its symptoms, such as loss of smell, constipation, a frozen shoulder and spidery writing, can be signs of other conditions. And they can appear up to a decade before motor symptoms, such as a tremor, slowness or rigidity of movement. Trishna Bharadia is another patient whose RSI turned out to be something far more serious. Eleven years ago, she went to her GP after her grip inexplicably became weaker — she needed help using a knife and fork to cut up her food. Having been diagnosed with RSI, she was referred to a physiotherapist for strengthening exercises. ‘My job involved working on a computer a lot, so I accepted what I was told,’ says Trishna, 35, a translator and media analyst from Marlow, Buckinghamshire. ‘But within three years, my symptoms had progressed quite significantly and I’d gradually lost all sensation down my left side, starting in a small area of my leg and then spreading from my toe to my shoulder blades.’ She adds: ‘That lasted for three months. But then I went back to my GP and was referred to a neurologist, who sent me for an MRI scan.’ After further testing, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of symptoms, including uncontrolled muscle movement, balance and vision problems and fatigue. ‘It wasn’t until that point that my neurologist looked back at my history and said the first episode of “RSI” was likely to have been MS,’ says Trishna, who volunteers for the MS Trust and other charities. ‘I now know that the symptoms of MS can easily be attributed to other things if you look at them in isolation, so it’s easy to ignore them or accept that it’s something else.’ Parkinson’s Awareness Week runs from April 20 to 26.

"A pampering few hours spent at the hair salon can you make you feel like a million dollars. Unfortunately, the bill at the end for a cut, colour and blow dry can feel like it is making a million dollar dent in your bank account. Now, a hair salon is offering clients the option of investing in a hair 'savings account' with weekly direct debit payments that can be used to pay for their hair appointments. Scroll down for video . Image investment: TONI&GUY hair salons have launched a new service allowing clients to contribute from $20 per week by direct debit to a personal hair fund . 'Lay-by for hair': Clients withdraw from their fund to pay for hair appointments, avoiding being hit with one large bill . TONI&GUY are launching the Future Hair Fund, encouraging their clients to treat the service as they would a gym membership. Starting from $20 per week, clients contribute regular payments to their fund, which they make a withdrawal from to pay for their salon service. Rather than saving up for months to afford their hair appointment, clients opt in to invest as much as they want over the $20 minimum per week, depending on how 'high maintenance' their hairstyle is. A platinum blonde requiring regular touch ups would contribute more per week than someone with a low-maintenance colour. Weekly investment: The brand likens the regular contributions to a gym membership . Promotion: The Future Hair Fund is currently available in 36 salons across Australia . Editor of cult beauty website Gritty Pretty Eleanor Pendleton is the face of the new promotion, and likens the service to 'lay-by for your hair'. She says: 'The TONI&GUY Future Hair Fund will make large service bills a thing of the past by providing the opportunity for flexible payment options. 'Australian women (and men) continue to seek financial efficiency within their lifestyle choices without wanting to compromise on service quality.' New or existing clients activate the service with an initial consultation to determine the type of services they require, and book in for regular appointments in advance. If the client wants additional services (for example, stopping in for a blow dry, or extra highlights) and they don't have enough in their fund to cover the service, they can simply top it up with a one-off payment.

"A judge is considering whether 50 pounds of potatoes and a produce box can be used as evidence in the trial of a man accused of killing six-year-old Etan Patz in Manhattan in 1979. The suspect, Pedro Hernandez, told authorities that he choked Etan in the basement of the convenience store where he worked after luring the boy down the stairs with a promise of a soda. He told investigators he put the boy's body in a plastic garbage bag, then put the bag inside a banana box and walked it about a block and a half away and put it down in an alcove with other trash. The body was never recovered. Part of Hernandez's job at the store was to lug boxes of produce, soda and beer up and down the basement stairs into the shop in SoHo. Bizarre request: The defense for Pedro Hernandez (pictured in court in November 2012) have asked to use 50lbs of potatoes in court to show he would not have been able to life Etan Patz's body as he claimed . 'I put it on my shoulder. I walked to the right,' he said of the box during his videotaped confession. 'I was strong at the time. I was 18. I was strong.' Victim: Etan Patz was just six when he vanished while walking to his school bus in Manhattan in 1979 . But attorneys for Hernandez, now 54, say the confession was made up and Hernandez is mentally ill. Attorney Harvey Fishbein suggests Hernandez was scrawny, weighing only about 115 pounds, and could not have carried a heavy box that far. He is asking to bring in the 50 pounds of potatoes and the produce box for jurors to demonstrate the weight of the body. On the missing-child poster, Etan's weight was listed as 50 pounds. But prosecutors say the measurement was a mistake made by frantic parents, and medical records from just a few months before Etan vanished have the boy weighing about 37 pounds. His mother, Julie, testified that he was very small for his age. Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon argued that the method for showing how heavy the box would be is unscientific and should not be shown to jurors because it would be wrong. 'It is incompetent evidence and unscientific because carrying a body is vastly different than potatoes,' she said. It would be the second piece of unconventional evidence on whether the confession is plausible. Earlier in the trial, prosecutors showed jurors a photo of a little boy crouching in a produce box, intending to show that Etan's body would have fit into such a box. The boy is Etan's size and shape but isn't identified. Defense attorney Alice Fontier argued that the photos were equally as unscientific. 'The people have been given free reign,' she said. 'We need to be allowed to introduce' the box. In court: Hernandez's family leave court in his trial earlier this month. His daughter Becky Hernandez, left, testified earlier this week about the negative effect her father's arrest has had on her . Seeking justice: Stanley Patz, Etan's father, and his daughter Shira Patz, left, arrive in court on March 9 . The judge said he would decide on Thursday. Hernandez made the surprising confession in 2012 to authorities who were interviewing him based on a tip from a relative. No physical evidence has been recovered, but at least five people have testified that over the years, Hernandez said he had killed a child in New York City. He moved from SoHo, where he had been staying with his sister and brother-in-law shortly after Etan disappeared, to New Jersey, where he has been living ever since, most recently in Maple Shade. Etan's parents helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. May 25, the day he disappeared, is National Missing Children's Day.","Suspect Pedro Hernandez previously told authorities he put the boy's body in a banana box and carried it on his shoulder before dumping it .
His defense team, who say he falsely confessed to the 1979 murder because he is mentally ill, want to show that his claims are not possible .
They are asking a judge if they can enter 50lbs of potatoes - the weight Etan was said to be when he disappeared - and a produce box as evidence .

"The father of a victim of the Germanwings disaster has made an emotional appeal for airlines to 'look after their pilots properly' to make sure another tragedy 'never happens'. Philip Bramley, whose 28-year-old son Paul was one of three Britons on board the ill-fated Airbus A320, said the 150 who lost their lives should 'not be forgotten'.

Emotional appeal: Philip Bramley, whose 28-year-old son Paul (seen in the photograph) was one of three Britons on board the ill-fated Airbus A320, said the 150 who lost their lives should 'not be forgotten' Grief: Speaking at a memorial near the crash site in the French Alps, Mr Bramley (centre) fought back his tears as he talked about his son, who was returning from a short holiday in Barcelona on the doomed flight . Paul Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with Ms Tiirik. He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days’ holiday with friends. Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family. Father-of two Martyn Matthews, from Wolverhampton, seven-month-old Julian Pracz-Bandres, from Manchester, and his mother Marina Bandres Lopez Belio, 37, were also among the dead. Philip Bramley today told Sky News that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was 'ill' and his motivation for deliberately downing the plane was 'irrelevant'. He said: 'What is relevant, is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever. I don't want it to be forgotten, ever.' 'I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly. We put our lives and our children's lives in their hands. 'I want to see this cloud over this town lifted and the natural beauty be restored and not to be remembered by the action of a single person.'

A special Mass was held today in Dignes to honour the victims and support their families. Bishop Jean-Philippe Nault led the Mass, attended by about 200 people from the surrounding region, deeply shaken by the crash. It was the deadliest crash on French soil in decades. Questions continue to be asked about Lubitz's mental and physical health days after he locked the captain out of the Airbus' cockpit and bringing down the aircraft. It was claimed today that the pilot may have sought treatment for problems with his vision in the weeks leading up to the crash. Prayer: A special Mass was held today in Dignes (pictured) to honour the victims and support their families . Lubitz is said to have sought help over his vision as recently as March 10, amid fears his eye problems may have jeopardised his ability to continue working as a pilot. It came as police revealed that evidence found at his home suggested he was suffering from a 'serious psychosomatic illness'. Officers reportedly found a variety of drugs used to treat mental illness at his flat in Dusseldorf, appearing to substantiate claims he was severely depressed. Authorities have already revealed he hid a sick note declaring him unfit to work on the day of the disaster. German newspaper Bild has reported that he previously told an ex-girlfriend: 'One day I will do something that will change the whole system, and then all will know my name and remember it.'","Philip Bramley lost his 28-year-old son Paul in the Germanwings disaster .

"Emma Sayle, founder of the Killing Kittens sex parties, who are hosting their first event in New York City . She is best known as the society beauty who attended the same school as the Duchess of Cambridge and now organises sex parties for young actors and models. And now Emma Sayle, founder of the Killing Kittens parties is taking her events to New York City, it has been reported. Miss Sayle has been hosting the parties for the ‘sexual elite’ at secret, upmarket locations, which include discreet boutique hotels in Surrey, country estates in Berkshire and West Sussex, and luxury penthouses in London and LA. Those who hope to gain access must be aged between 18 and 45 and must either be a single girl or part of a couple. Applications are made via the Killing Kittens website and must be accompanied by a photograph. Now the New York Post has reported that the first Killing Kittens party will take place in a rented loft in Manhattan near to the Flatiron building on Saturday. It is thought around 60 people have already signed up to attend the party, including bankers and models. She told the newspaper: 'Statistically, New York is in our favour for it to work. 'It might help with all the frustration of all those women who can’t find men. They can come and share the men!' An event in Los Angeles is also set to take place at the weekend. Ms Sayle went to Downe House, the all-girls public school in Berkshire where Kate Middleton was also briefly a pupil. The entrepreneur then attended the University of Birmingham, where she first started organising parties and charities events. After graduating, she did a stint in the City before gravitating towards PR. It was then that she became acquainted with the sex-party industry. She also joined the Duchess in a dragon boat team called the Sisterhood for a charity race in 2007. Ms Sayle attended the same public girls school as the Duchess of Cambridge. They are pictured together in 2007 taking part in a dragon boat race for charity . Her first Killing Kittens event took place in Covent Garden, Central London, in 2005. Since then she has expanded the business across the UK, and has staged parties in the United States, with plans to host events in Australia and New Zealand. Speaking last year and referring to her UK Killing Kittens parties, which are aimed at those aged between 18 and 45, Ms Sayle said: ‘We've have had a few MPs and famous singers. 'We haven’t had any Royals yet but there have been a few A-list actors and actresses – but I couldn't reveal who.’ Last year, she also revealed how she had expanded her parties to cater for older people over the age of 45.

Like their younger counterparts attending Ms Sayles’s Killing Kittens parties, would-be Silver Kittens must submit a recent photograph of themselves with their application forms. Only the good-looking are invited and they must be aged 45 or over. About 80 guests aged up to 60, wearing black tie or cocktail dresses, ate oysters and chocolates and sipped champagne before ‘retiring’ to candle-lit boudoirs. At the time she told the Mail on Sunday: 'Our first event went really well. The oldest person there was a guy aged 60, but he was in good shape. He had an air of confidence – sexiness comes down to confidence. ‘You can get a lot of stunning catwalk models in their 20s who are not confident. There’s nothing sexy about them. Older people just don’t care.'","Emma Sayle is founder of Killing Kittens, company organising sex parties .

"The price of olive oil is expected to rocket after the EU ordered the felling of millions of trees infected with a deadly microbe. Brussels has recommended that about 11million olive trees in southern Italy, many centuries old, be chopped down. They have been infected with Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterium spread by an aphid. The disease, first identified in the Americas has already wiped out a million trees in Salento, southern Puglia. Olive trees in southern Puglia in Italy. The EU has recommended that 11million trees be cut down after they were found to be infected with a deadly microbe . It is feared that unless drastic action is taken to fell the groves, the bacterium will spread to other olive-producing regions of Italy such as Tuscany and Umbria, and even to other Mediterranean countries. Xylella fastidiosa can also infect vines, almond trees and other crops. Puglia, a region in the heel of Italy, produces about 11million tons of olives a year, more than a third of the national crop, and they are used to make some of the country’s best oils. If the trees are destroyed, it could effect production and send the prices of olive oil soaring . The initial area to be culled is 20,000 acres – about 30 sq miles – between Lecce to Brindisi. It contains around 11million trees, according to Unaprol, the largest consortium of growers. Many of Italy’s oldest olive groves, some dating back 500 years, have been infected by the bacterium, which causes plants to shrivel, leaving them incapable of bearing fruit. The effect on production will mean shortages in the supply of olive oil and is likely to lead to higher prices for shoppers in Britain and around the world. Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for Food Safety and Security, said he was ‘profoundly concerned by the gravity of the situation’. He added: ‘We have to take decisive measures with immediate effect. Naturally it is very painful for the growers but it is necessary to remove all the affected trees, it is the most effective measure.’ A committee will meet on Thursday next week to rubber stamp the directive, which growers fear will create a desert in the area as it will not be possible to replant it with olive groves. Popular singer and olive producer Albano Carrisi said culling the trees is ‘cruel’ and ‘useless’. He said: ‘Do not disfigure our beautiful Puglia. Puglia without olives is like the Vatican without cardinals’. Gianni Cantele, president of one Puglia producers’ consortium, Coldiretti, said it was ‘a natural disaster’.","The EU has recommended that 11million Italian olive trees be cut down .

"A Catholic Church official has apologised after a priest told children and parents at a Melbourne primary school that Jill Meagher may not have met such a tragic end had she been 'more faith-filled'. Radio Station 3AW reported that the priest showed the congregation a picture of Adrian Bayley, the man convicted for the Melbourne woman's brutal rape and murder, before claiming that if Ms Meagher's faith had of been stronger she 'would have been home in bed' instead of 'walking down Sydney Road at 3am.' Scroll down for video . A priest told a congregation that Jill Meagher may not have been killed if she were 'more faith-filled' as she would have been 'home in bed' and 'not walking down Sydney Road at 3am' At least 100 people, including students, staff and parents, witnessed the comments at St Christopher's Primary School at Airport West on Friday. Greg Bennet apologised on behalf of the preist and said the 'offensive' comments did not reflect the views of the church . Monsignor Greg Bennett, vicar-general of the archdiocese of Melbourne, condemned the homily and said the 'offensive' comments did not represent the views of the church. 'We do not share the sentiment of the homily this morning and we certainly apologise for the hurt that this homily may have caused today,' he told 3AW. 'The reference to Jill Meagher in particular was offensive and inappropriate and the people of Victoria and Ireland mourn her sad and tragic death.' He said he has spoken with the priest who acknowledges that the homily was not appropriate and apologises for the 'upset' and 'offence' it may have caused. Carolyn Worth, manager of the South Eastern Centre Against Sexual Assault, told Fairfax media that the comments were an 'extreme' form of 'victim blaming'. 'This is about a violent, dangerous man who attacked somebody. It's not about what she was doing,' she said. The revelations come amid comments from Victoria police, spurred by the stabbing murder of Masa Vukotic, warning women to take reasonable precautions when walking in parks at night, and if possible avoid it all together. Ms Worth said women 'have a right' to walk the streets alone without fearing an attack from a 'dangerous predator'. Dangerous predator:Mr Bayley was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of raping and killing Ms Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012 . 'It's offensive to all women, certainly to Jill Meagher's family. In some ways it's insulting to religious people too because it isn't about being out at 3am. [Masa Vukotic] was out at 7pm at a time lots of us would be out walking. You expect to be safe from being attacked at any of those times. 'To have someone suggest that the problem is that you don't believe in God enough is ignoring completely what actually happens when there are dangerous men out attacking people.' Mr Bayley was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of raping and killing Ms Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012. Backlash: Twitter users didn't take the 'victim blaming' comments lightly . The priest faced harsh criticism for the comments he made in front of a group of primary school children . Since his conviction the extent of Mr Bayley's sordid past has come to light with revelations that he raped a Dutch backpacker and a St Kilda sex worker in the months leading up to the ruthless attack on Ms Meagher. Mr Bayley has now been found guilty of more than 20 rape offences. Repeat offender: Mr Bayley has been found guilty of more than 20 rape offences .

"Natalie Bennett, the party leader, said the proposals would create a 'peaceful political revolution' at the General Election . The Green Party is calling for the Human Rights Act to be extended to include animals so that killers and kidnappers of whales, dolphins and apes will face the same jail sentences as human murderers. Its bizarre blueprint, which also included a tax on nappies and a better standard of living for rodents, was laid out at the party's annual conference in Liverpool this weekend. Likening the killing of sea creatures and monkeys to that of humans, its leader Natalie Bennett urged the law be changed to ensure anyone found guilty of such crimes against animals face a prison sentence. Addressing the conference she said the move would create a 'peaceful political revolution' at May's General Election. Her proposal would see the 1948 Human Rights Act extended to protect 'all sentient life forms'. Taxes on nappies, bans on horse racing and the creation of a fleet of hospital ships for the third world were also set to become official policy for the during a series of debates today. The Greens also plan to form an alliance with the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru to force a minority Labour government to cut the defence budget. Funding would be taken from  nuclear deterrence to be spent on foreign aid, increasing the budget to £16 billion a year, or one per cent of GDP. On Sunday members were due to debate using the budget to build a fleet of hospital ships to provide worldwide humanitarian aid and support. The party also proposes new levies on manufacturers of disposable nappies. Plans to extend the Human Rights act, which states that 'no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'  would mean anyone killing, torturing or 'kidnapping' dolphins, whales, apes and elephants would occur for equivalent crimes committed against humans. Party leader Natalie Bennett, who will be joined by model Lily Cole on Sunday, said the proposals would create a 'peaceful political revolution' at the General Election. Other plans include Forest Schools to giving youngsters a 'hands-on' appreciation of trees, bans on goods made in factories that do not comply with British health and safety standards, and splitting the jackpot on the National Lottery to create more frequent, smaller wins. The conference is the Greens' decision making body, whereby policies approved by members become official party doctrine. An elected committee then decides which policies appear in the manifesto booklet.

"The UK is to supply a further package of non-lethal military equipment worth £850,000 as a gift to the government of Ukraine, it has been announced. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the package will include first aid kits, night vision goggles, helmets, GPS (global positioning system) units and 'ruggedised' laptops.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK is sending more non-lethal aid to Ukraine . In a written statement to the House of Commons, Mr Fallon said that the UK's gift came in response to a request from Kiev for help with basic equipment, supplies of which have been depleted by months of instability caused by Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. Mr Fallon said: 'This Government is committed to supporting Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. As a result of their prolonged engagement in this conflict, the Ukrainians face a serious shortage of basic equipment, and have requested help. 'Our proposed gift of non-lethal equipment is designed to prevent further Ukrainian fatalities and casualties and to help improve situational awareness on the ground.' And he added: ' Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and its destabilising activities in eastern Ukraine, including  direct military support to the separatists, have demonstrated its disregard for international law. 'The latest ceasefire agreement, reached in Minsk on February 12 and which came into force on  February 15, has seen a reduction in violence in the conflict zone. We very much hope it will help  end the conflict. 'However, fighting has not ceased in some areas and there continues to be  fatalities and casualties amongst the Ukrainian armed forces.'

"Tragic end: Timothy Wallace, 9, was struck and killed by a train in rural Tennessee Sunday night after he took off from a relative's home . A 9-year-old autistic boy from Tennessee was struck and killed by a train Sunday night after he wandered away from a relative's home on his own. Timothy Wallace was staying at his aunt's house in Sale Creek Sunday when he went missing at around 10pm Sunday. Hamilton County Sheriff Jim Hammond said Timothy, a third-grader at Griffith Elementary School in Dunlap, was non-verbal and had walked away from home in the past. After an hour-long search in heavy rain and dense fog, rescuers came upon the 9-year-old's body along railroad track near Coulterville Road in rural Tennessee. Investigators later determine that Timothy was struck and killed by a northbound Norfolk Southern train. The operators of the train told sheriff’s deputies they did not know the locomotive had struck a child.

"George Osborne announced fuel duty had been frozen for the fifth year in a row . Fuel duty has been frozen for a fifth year in succession, allowing the Chancellor to boast that motorists have had ‘£10 off a tank with the Tories’. Yesterday’s move means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for September 1 will not go ahead. And the freezing of duty over the five years of the Coalition means the average driver spends £10 less per fill-up than if the controversial ‘fuel-price escalator’ had been implemented in full. Between 2011 and 2016, a typical motorist will have saved £675, the Treasury calculated. The planned fuel duty rise by the RPI rate of inflation on September 2015 would have increased the current duty rate by 0.54p per litre – from the current 57.95p to 58.49p. For an average family car fill-up of 55 litres, this would have increased the cost by 30p. Mr Osborne said he had cancelled the fuel duty rise because ‘I want to help families with the cost of filling up a car’. He added: ‘It’s a cost that bears heavily on small businesses too. It’s the longest duty freeze in over 20 years. It saves a family around £10 every time they fill up their car. That’s £10 off a tank with the Tories.’ Motoring groups welcomed the policy and urged any future government ‘not to step back on the escalator’. The RAC said the above-inflation fuel duty ‘escalator’ that operated between 1993 and 1999 ‘is the primary reason that we now pay nearly 70 per cent in tax on every litre of fuel we buy at the pumps’. AA president Edmund King said: ‘The Coalition has done its “fuel duty” by shielding drivers from some of the impact of volatile fuel prices over the past four years by freezing fuel duty, and we welcome the further freeze and cancellation of the scheduled fuel duty rise for September 2015. ‘With petrol and diesel prices surging and falling by more than 35p a litre since 2010, the continued four-year fuel duty freeze allows the Coalition to dodge the fuel-protest bullet.’ Howard Cox, of the FairFuelUK campaign, welcomed the freeze but said the Chancellor should have gone further and cut duty. The move means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for September 1 will not go ahead, which for an average family car fill-up of 55 litres, would have increased the cost by 30p . He added: ‘We give Mr Osborne six out of ten for endeavour and will continue to campaign that duty should be frozen for the lifetime of the next Parliament.’ RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘With fuel duty revenue making up about 5 per cent of the Treasury’s tax income there was never going to be a huge giveaway as the Chancellor still desperately needs motorists’ money.’ He added: ‘But with the latest figures showing that almost a million of the poorest households see a quarter of what they spend go on buying and running a car the continued freeze is very welcome.’ Lynsey and Tom Fox , pictured with their two children Megan, 6, and Emily, 1, will save £50 a month on fuel . Lynsey and Tom Fox will save £600 a year thanks to the fuel duty freeze. The couple, who use their cars for commuting and taking six-year-old Megan and one-year-old Emily to school and nursery, drive a combined 1,500 miles a month. Mr Fox, an IT manager, spends two hours a day making his 35-mile commute in rush hour. Filling up his 2.7-litre Mercedes every week costs him £280 a month. Mrs Fox, a maths teacher, spends another £70 a month on fuel for her VW Golf. Yesterday George Osborne delayed an increase in fuel duty once again – meaning drivers are nearly £10 better off every time they fill up their car than they would have been had Labour’s ‘fuel-price escalator’ still been operating. This saves the family, pictured, about £50 a month. Mr Fox said: ‘The extra money we save will be a nice little boost and we can spend more on the kids.’ Company cars take a clobbering . Basil Fawlty attacks his Austin 1100 in show . Starsky and Hutch's 1975 Ford Gran Torino . The classic car to which Basil Fawlty administered ‘a damned good thrashing’ is now exempt from road tax. The character played by Monty Python actor John Cleese famously took a tree branch to a red Austin 1100 estate in frustration after it broke down on him in the 1970s comedy series Fawlty Towers. But now it has reached an age where the Government no longer requires Vehicle Excise Duty to be paid. Also newly exempt is the red 1975 Ford Gran Torino – with its trademark stripe – as used and rolled over by American TV cops Starsky & Hutch, played by actor and singer David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser in the popular 1970s crime- fighting series. Paul Clark, senior tax manager at City accountants Deloitte, said: ‘An exemption from Vehicle Excise Duty for vehicles constructed 40 or more years ago was introduced in April 2014. ‘This exemption applies automatically on a rolling basis on 1 April each year. ‘So next month all cars made before 1 January 1976 will be exempt from the duty.’ He added: ‘This includes the 1975 Ford Gran Torino used in Starsky & Hutch and the Austin 1100 estate famously thrashed by Basil Fawlty in 1975’. The majority of drivers with company cars will be hundreds of pounds worse off after the Chancellor moved to make the work perk ‘greener’. The tax levied on the majority of company cars will be increased by three percentage points in 2019-20. The rate for environmentally-friendly vehicles will also rise – but at a ‘slower rate’. City accountants said the changes are unfair on company car drivers locked into three or four-year deals who chose a cheaper vehicle ‘in good faith’ – only to have it re-classified months later as a gas-guzzler, and taxed accordingly. The Government’s avowed aim of the changing tax rates for the ‘benefit in kind’ is to push company car drivers into greener vehicles – such as fully electric or hybrid cars, which carry a smaller tax burden. This has fuelled a boom in low-tax ‘plug-in’ hybrid vehicles, which can be charged from the mains but also run on conventional fuel. The tax on these so-called ‘ultra-low-emissions vehicles – or ULEVs – is still rising too. However, the Chancellor is at pains to point out that it is rising at a ‘slower’ rate because he is increasing the gap between the tax on the cleanest ‘green’ cars and the conventionally-fuelled alternatives. George Osborne told MPs: ‘To encourage a new generation of low-emission vehicles we will increase their company car tax more slowly than previously planned.’ Ashley Hollinshead of accountants Deloitte stressed that because most company car drivers are signed up to three or four-year deals, they will be penalised for choices made well before the changes were introduced. ‘It’s effectively a retrospective tax on cars,’ he said. ‘Many employees with company cars will be locked into long term deals and will have no choice but to bear the ever-increasing cost of company car tax.’ ‘Having previously introduced an annual two-percentage-point increase in the rate of company car benefit in kind to 2018/19, today George Osborne announced a further annual hike of three percentage points from 2019/20. This announcement will see the benefit in kind rate increase by nearly 50 per cent in the period to 2019/20. ‘For example, the benefit in kind rate on [a car emitting 100 grams of carbon per kilometre] will increase from 19 per cent next tax year to 28 per cent by 2019/20.‘ . The changes mean a driver paying the 40p tax rate with a £28,000 1.6-litre Nissan Qashqai provided by their employer will be £1,008 worse off after five years, with a ‘benefit in kind’ tax bill of £3,360. Someone with a Golf GTI worth £28,000 will also see their tax increase by £1,008, to a total of £3,472. An executive with a £38,000 BMW 5 Series will pay £1,368 more, taking their annual bill to £4,712, while anyone with an £81,000 three-litre Range Rover Sport as their company car will be nearly £2,600 worse off, with an annual bill of £11,998. However, taxes on green cars mean the driver of a top-selling £28,304 Mitsubishi Outlander hybrid will also see their company car tax treble – rising by £1,245 to £1,811 a year. Tax on a £32,000 Volkswagen Golf GTE hybrid will rise by £1,408 to £2,028 by 2019-20. Britain will become a world-leader in the development of driverless cars thanks to a £100million boost from the Chancellor. The figure will be matched by private-sector funding for a total pot of £200million. The announcement was welcomed by Jaguar Land Rover, which hailed a policy that will ‘help create the smarter and more connected cars of the future’. Two driverless car pilot schemes are already under way in Greenwich and Bristol. Much of the technology – from automatic parking to radars that scan for pedestrians or cyclists and can slam on the brakes – already exist in the latest cars on the road. However, new research is aimed at making driverless cars both safe and socially acceptable.","Move means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for September is cancelled .

"Neymar insists his head was never turned by Manchester City's interest in him before signing for Barcelona from Santos in June 2013. Neymar's signature had been coveted from teams across Europe and City led the way from England but ahead of the  Champions League second leg clash at the Nou Camp between the two teams, the Brazil striker is adamant only one side interested him. ‘Barcelona was the only club I ever wanted to join,' Neymar said.

"A woman was arrested in Wisconsin who authorities in Illinois say had 85 live dogs and at least 65 dead dogs and cats at a rural rental house near Freeport, Illinois. Tina McKinnon, 45, was taken into custody in Linn, Wisconsin early on Thursday. She faces charges of felony aggravated animal cruelty and misdemeanor cruel treatment to animals. This type of felony is typically punishable with probation or up to three years in prison, Sheriff's Lt. Richard Roodhouse said. The shocking discovery was made by Cole Eshleman, the property's owner, who heard barking while working in a machine shed at 1358 Heitter Road. More than 30 dogs ran out when he opened the door. He said McKinnon had only moved in after Christmas. 150 animals were rescued from the rural Illinois property - sadly 65 were already dead . Tina McKinnon, 45, was taken into custody in Linn, Wisconsin early on Thursday. She had reportedly only moved into the house just after Christmas . The house at 1358 Heitter Road outside Freeport, Illinois will likely have to have its floors ripped out. Dogs were found in closets, crates, the stove and inside duct work . Animal control warden Kristin Laue said the dogs had been given free rein in the house. 'There were feces all over the house, urine, of course, dogs everywhere: dogs in closets, dogs in the stove, in the duct work,' Laue told The Journal Standard. Some dogs had been confined to crates. A search warrant was obtained and animal control authorities, Friends Forever Humane Society and a private citizen rounded up the dogs, a process that took almost five hours. They counted 29 dead cats and 36 dead dogs. 'I don't think that person lived in the house. I think that person supposedly lived in a car,' Stepheson County Assistant State's Attorney, Joe Lentz, told ABC 17 Eyewitness News. Stephenson County Animal Control received a call  that a pack of dogs was running down Heitter Road. 'Just a whole lot of dogs ... like 40 dogs running along the road,' Lentz said. He added that the dogs kept running back to the home, which is how animal control knew they had the correct location. Kristin Laue comforts a female pit bull-mix at the Freeport Animal Hospital on Wednesday. The dog had multiple injuries and scars . A terrier-mix waits for additional treatment. It took almost five hours to round up all of the dogs. When they were discovered as many as 40 ran out of the front door of the home . They got a search warrant to enter the home and discovered all the animals inside. 'Some animals... couldn't be removed I guess. They were kind of like stuck to the floor and stuff like that. And, some puppies were in an oven, just for protection, apparently,' said Lentz. Mackinnon had contacted animal control and an animal rescue organization in recent weeks, and she told them she was a rescuer and needed help, Laue said. The woman gave away a few animals but didn't hold up her end of other agreements and did not give an address. 'We tried to help her, but she never took us up on it,' Laue said. 'It was just a matter of time before something happened where we found out where she was.' The dogs ranged in age from young puppies to adults, likely 10 to 12 years old, Laue said. Sixty-one dogs are being held temporarily at Freeport Animal Hospital, where Laue works, and the rest have been dispersed to area shelters. Many of the smaller dogs are sociable and appear to be in good health, but have parasites and skin conditions associated with contact with feces. Laue holds two female Chihuahuas rescued from the property. Many of the smaller animals are sociable and appear to be in good health . Donations are being accepted at the animal hospital, including small towels and rags, newspapers, dog food and dish soap. Stephenson County, Illlinois Sheriff's Department officials say they are coordinating with Walworth County, Wisconsin officers for McKinnon's extradition. Eshleman said that he didn't yet have a damage estimate for his property, but he anticipated having to cut out and replace the flooring throughout the house. McKinnon told him she cleaned homes and had two dogs, Eshleman said, and Laue believes she had previously lived in Texas and Wisconsin. McKinnon has been in trouble for having too many dogs before according to authorities. She was kicked out of a Whiteside County apartment for having too many dogs and fined in Winnebago County in 2013 for having 22 dogs, four of which were not vaccinated. The Journal Standard also reported that this is not the first time McKinnon has damaged a home to this extent. In March 2013 she left a property in Winnebago County in such a state that every room had to be gutted including all the bedrooms and the finished basement.","A 45-year-old woman has been arrested in Wisconsin after almost 150 animals were discovered locked in the home she rented in rural Illinois .

"House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner is expected to announce a new investigation this week into the emails Hillary Clinton sent while she was Secretary of State. Clinton has been under fire after it was revealed she used a personal email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com - instead of a government one while leading the State Department. At a press conference last week, Clinton said all of her 'work-related' emails from the personal account were delivered to the State Department after a 'thorough' review. Scroll down for video . House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner is expected to announce a new investigation this week into the emails Hillary Clinton sent while she was Secretary of State . But top House Republicans told ABC News that Boehner plans to further investigate after Clinton admitted to destroying more than 31,000 emails that were deemed personal. A question-and-answer document distributed by Clinton states that 30,490 emails were designated as 'work-related', while 31,380 were determined to be 'private and personal'. Clinton said that subjects of the personal emails varied from planning her daughter Chelsea's wedding to her mother's funeral. She added that she had deleted the personal emails because she did not feel there was any reason to save them. Clinton acknowledged that it 'would've been better' if she had used a second email account and carried a second phone but at the time had opted for the 'convenience' of only having to carry one device for all her emails. Clinton has been under fire after it was revealed she used a personal email account instead of a government one while leading the State Department . She also noted that the 'vast majority' of her work emails were sent to government email addresses and were thus 'captured and preserved immediately' on the State Department's system. Clinton has asked the State Department to make her work-related emails public. The personal email address surfaced as multiple congressional panels investigated the 2012 attack on a US diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, during Clinton's State Department tenure. A special House Committee exclusively focused on auditing the executive branch's response to the 2012 Benghazi terror attack is subpoenaing emails from Clinton's personal account. Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, the head of the committee, said he wants Clinton to testify about her email practices before Congress by April. 'Who gets to decide what's personal and what's public?' he said on Fox News. 'I just can't trust her lawyers to make the determination that the public is getting everything they're entitled to.' As for Clinton, she said believes most people will understand that 'no one' wants their personal emails made public and will 'respect  that privacy'.","Clinton said all of her 'work-related' emails from her personal account were delivered to the State Department after a 'thorough' review .

"An Australian businessman, who was charged with horrific child abuse in the Philippines, reportedly fled a string of  fraud and sold his young bride as a prostitute. Peter Gerard Scully slipped out of Melbourne and fled to Manila in 2011 after he allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme, The Age reports. Scully was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission but avoided being charged with 117 fraud and deception offences, having departed Victoria. When the 52-year-old returned to Australia, he was accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim. Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . The allegations followed as the father-of-two was arrested last month after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon. Scully was charged on Friday and he could now face the death penalty in the Philippines after being accused of killing a child and orchestrating an international paedophile ring. The Age reports Scully was never charged with child sex crimes in Victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history. An unnamed former business associate, who lost more than $200,000 in the fraudulent scheme, told The Age he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against Scully. 'Does it surprise me?' the associate said. 'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.' A search warrant was issued for his arrest in 2012 but Scully remained in the Philippines, where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. It has sparked such an outrage in the Philippines that calls are growing daily to have him executed. It's alleged Scully, from the Melbourne suburb of Burwood, had  took part in perverted acts against children as young as one, which he filmed. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Sherwin Gatchalian, an MP with the Nationalist People's Coalition, said. Filipinos across the country took to social media to call for his execution. Scully managed to avoid being arrested until February 20 this year before a former partner told police that Scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013. It was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully. An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other. The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested .","Peter Gerald Scully was arrested in Philippines on child sex abuse charges .

"With her puppy dog eyes, Millie the cocker spaniel knows exactly how to persuade her owner to feed her a treat. She stares up, pleading for a morsel of food, and when her owner Jacqueline Maguire gives in, the dog waddles around wagging her tail in delight. But all those extra nibbles have added up - and now Millie is morbidly obese. Scroll down for video . Chubby: Millie the cocker spaniel weighs 74lbs - which is twice the average a dog of her breed should do . Heavy: At that weight, it is little surprise the prized pet is looking a little slow on her feet . Weighing in at nearly 74lb, she is twice the size of a healthy cocker spaniel. Vets say that Millie, who has now been put on a strict diet, is symptomatic of the ballooning British population of obese pets. According to a report published today by the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA), there will be more overweight pets than healthy pets within five years. Some 80 per cent of vets surveyed by the charity reported an increase in obesity cases they had seen in the last two years. Mrs Maguire, 75, from Romford, admitted that Millie put on weight because she is fed too much. She said her dog has perfected the begging routine - even doing a ‘happy dance’ when fed an extra treat. Fat: Bulldog Daisy, from Middlesbrough, is another of Britain's heavy hounds . Portly: But it is not just a problem with dogs - Grace the giant rabbit also weighs far too much . All creatures great and small: As does Spider, the rotund rat, who was pictured by PDSA staff in Swansea . ‘I do give in to her begging far too often,’ Mrs Maguire said. ‘I have four rescue cats and when I feed them she’s hovering around and grabs any food she can. I have to shut her in another room and feed them on the table. ‘Even then, if I turn my back for a moment she’ll be straight in, she’ll steal and eat all the cats’ food given the slightest chance.’ According to a poll of 1,000 pet owners carried out by PDSA, nearly half do not realise weight is a problem for their pets. The problem is particularly acute for dogs. The estimate more than six million dogs - about 75 per cent - in the UK are exercised for less than an hour a day. The problem is getting worse, with fewer dogs than ever being properly exercised, fuelling an explosion in canine obesity. Warning: The PDSA says obesity is exploding within the dog population, although many owners don't realise it is a problem. Poppy the pug (pictured) has been on a diet since she was rescued from a puppy farm . Diet: Tina, an overweight border terrier with PDSA veterinary nurse Laura Meiklejohn at Edinburgh . Chunky: Guy the cat weighed in a 10kg, or 22lb - medium sized cats should weigh about half that . Walkies: Bobby, a labrador from Dundee, could do with more exercise - like six million dogs in the UK . Separate research found that 2.7million - a third of British dogs - are not being given daily off-lead exercise, an increase of 600,000 since 2011. Vets say obesity in animals creates the same health risks as it does in humans. Overweight pets develop deadly conditions such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes, as well as debilitating conditions including arthritis. Dr Philippa Yam, of Glasgow University’s School of Veterinary Medicine, said: ‘It’s clear that pet obesity continues to be a major issue due to a lack of understanding about pets’ welfare needs.’ Running: Research has found that 2.7million - a third of British dogs - are not being given daily off-lead exercise. Duke the Labrador, pictured going for a stroll in Cardiff, weighs 61kg, but should be 28 to 30kgs . Hope: The owners of Zorro the cat from Dundee managed to get its weight under control once more . PDSA is encouraging owners to join its Pet Fit Club competition - an annual contest to help reduce animals’ weight. Nicola Martin, head of pet health at PDSA, said: ‘Our research has shown that pet obesity is a growing problem and that too many people are continuing to feed their pets inappropriate foods including takeaways, cake, cheese and chips and sadly many pets aren’t getting enough exercise. ‘Over the past decade, Pet Fit Club has transformed the lives of some of the UK’ s most obese pets, having helped nearly 100 animals shed over 60 stone so we are welcoming entries again and offering our expertise.’","PDSA warning of an 'epidemic' of obesity among the nation's canines .

Abase Hussen (circled right), whose daughter fled the UK last month to join ISIS, was pictured at an Islamic protest alongside Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale (circled left) Adebowale, who killed Lee Rigby alongside Michael Adebolajo, turns to reveal his face at the notorious rally . Vicious: In 2012, Abase Hussen (left) marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London, taking part in the burning of an American flag . He manages to grab the flag briefly before being forced to drop it because of the power of the smoke and flames. As the remainder of the flag burns on the ground, Mr Hussen chants ‘Allahu Akbar’. He pushes the palm of his hand repeatedly toward the embers, rejoicing at the destruction of the stars and stripes. Mr Hussen – the father of one of the three schoolgirls who fled Britain to join Islamic State – then turns his attention to a burning Israeli flag on the floor and begins to chant and gesture toward it. He is one of a dozen fanatics standing behind a banner which proclaims: ‘The followers of Mohammed will conquer America.’ Behind him, hundreds of fanatics repeatedly chant incendiary slogans while holding menacing black jihadi flags. Among the rabble-rousers was notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who has led a number of Islamist groups that were subsequently banned. Alongside him stood Michael Adebowale, one of the two Muslim converts who murdered and almost beheaded Fusilier Lee Rigby in the name of Allah eight months later. Sinister: Also at the rally was Adebowale who went on to murder soldier Lee Rigby the following year . Respectable: Abase Hussen, pictured far right, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee following his daughter's disappearance. The report was released this week . Abu Izzadeen, infamous for heckling former Home Secretary John Reid in 2006, also led some of the chanting. But last month Mr Hussen gave evidence to Parliament refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls’ actions, instead seeking to blame the police, teachers, Turkish officials and others. In an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen, who was with the families of the other two girls, denied even knowing what Islamic radicalisation was. Cuddly: Hussen appealing for the return of his 'jihadi daughter' a few weeks ago after she ran off . ‘As for me, I don’t know the symptoms even — what radicalisation is,’ he told MPs. Mr Hussen also repeatedly blasted the Metropolitan Police for handing a letter to his daughter requesting parental permission to speak to the girls about a friend who had earlier travelled to Syria. He said police officers should have given it directly to the families. He said: ‘I strongly disagree with the letter being given to 15-year-old girls. The word “police” by itself and “terrorism” or “counter-terrorism”, as global issues – it is a heavy burden for a 15-year-old to deal with that. We also feel that we are neglected as parents. ‘We are supposed to know these things. We are the guardians. The letter destructs our daughter, destructs our family and terrorises our children. What we want to know is: apart from this letter, what was the verbal conversation with this child? I know my daughter. She is the kind of girl who, if it is sunset, she will call me to pick her up. ‘How on earth she travelled abroad to join ISIS, is a very difficult question for us to answer – even to predicate. The letter terrified my daughter.’ The families were led by their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, once the representative of a close associate of the Woolwich killers, who repeatedly demanded an apology. Mr Akunjee, who has posted extremist views on his Facebook page, accused Scotland Yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in February and their close friend in December. In a 45-minute grilling in front of the families, Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was forced to apologise for failing to communicate more directly with the families. Giving evidence to the committee, Mr Hussen claimed he did not know that his daughter Amira might have been exposed to radical views. Chairman Keith Vaz pressed him on this point, asking him: ‘Did it come to your attention in any way that they were involved in the kinds of things that it is alleged that they were involved in following this becoming public?’ Mr Hussen replied: ‘Not at all. Nothing.’ Chilling: A CCTV image of 15-year-old Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Shamima Begum, 15, at Gatwick Airport before they caught their flight to Turkey . Fanaticism: Footage of the controversial rally showed Mr Hussen chanting among the crowds of protesters. The demonstration, held in 2012, was led by firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Lee Rigby's killer . Extremist: The protest was led by the hate preacher and notorious rabble rouser Anjem Choudary, who made a speech saying that Sharia would take over the entire world, including America and the UK . Shocking: Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage (pictured) to see if any criminal offences had been committed . What the MPs were not told was that Mr Hussen was caught on camera in one of a wave of demonstrations that took place across the world in September 2012. Thousands had taken to the streets to protest against an obscure film called Innocence of Muslims, criticised for ridiculing Islam. In London, more than 150 clashed with police outside the US embassy. They included Luton radicals Abu Rahin Aziz, who is fighting for Islamic State, and Saiful Islam, who was the subject of a Channel 4 exposé called Proud and Prejudiced. Radical: Amira Abase, 15, daughter of Abase Hussen, travelled to Syria with two other girls . Rahin Aziz has called for Theresa May to be executed, suggested that Islamic State-style executions take place in Trafalgar Square and threatened to blow up Big Ben. Last night members of the Commons committee expressed their shock and astonishment over Mr Hussen’s activities. Labour MP Ian Austin said: ‘It is extraordinary that this man blamed the police, the Government, the school, the Turkish government and everyone else for his daughter’s decision to go to Syria but failed to mention his own involvement in an appalling Islamist rally. Perhaps the committee should invite Mr Hussen back so he can explain what he was doing.’ Tory MP Michael Ellis, who also sits on the committee, said: ‘This will come as a surprise to those who heard criticism of the police and school. This raises serious questions about the potential negative influence on an impressionable young mind.’ Mr Vaz said: ‘It is clear that families and communities need to take greater responsibility for protecting young people who could be at risk of radicalisation. ‘Witnesses before the committee are responsible for their own statements. When Mr Hussen gave evidence, he said he had no idea that his daughter had been involved in radicalisation or had been radicalised.’ Amira fled with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from their homes in east London to Syria last month. The trio were following in the footsteps of Sharmeena Begum, who left their school, Bethnal Green Academy in East London, to go to Syria in December. Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage to see if any offences had been committed.","Father of one of three schoolgirl 'jihadi brides' captured on camera at rally .

"To say that today's Cricket World Cup Final is the one everyone from this side of the globe had hoped for is an understatement, but it is also will be between the tournament's two best teams. A World Cup record attendance of 95,000 people will fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in a decider that, one way or another, will be a memorable one. Thousands of fans dressed in their team's colours and waving flags thronged the streets all around the MCG. Australia seems to have the upper hand in the tournament decider, with New Zealand all-out for 183 after 45 overs. However, Australia's chase got off to a rocky start, with opener Aaron Finch out for a duck. Scroll down for video . Australian opener Aaron Finch was out for a duck .

"Shelia Jones, headteacher at St Joseph's Roman Catholic primary school, is accused of forcing children to lie on the floor while she 'calls God' A headteacher of a Catholic primary school is accused of punishing pupils by forcing them to lie on the floor in a prayer room while she pretended to ring God to say they had been naughty. Shelia Jones, who is in charge of more than 200 pupils at St Joseph's Roman Catholic primary school in Devizes, Wiltshire, allegedly humiliated the children on more than one occasion, it is claimed. Angry parents have written to the school's governors and complained to the education watchdog Ofsted after the revelations came to light. Tammy Brimble claims her 11-year-old son Cyrus was among three other boys threatened by Mrs Jones with a 'phone call to God' and is calling for her to resign. She said: 'I didn't find out about it will we got home. Cyrus was very quiet and I could tell something was bothering him. 'When he told me what had happened to him and three other boys, I was upset but I wanted to find out why she did it. 'I don't think what she did was appropriate at all. We are not Roman Catholics but it was still distressing for my child for her to call on God like that.' Mrs Brimble made several attempts to speak to the headteacher and eventually wrote a letter of complaint to the school governors and Ofsted. She said in a letter to Simon Napper, deputy chairman of the governors: 'Cyrus has been subjected to the humiliation of being punished by Sheila on more than one occasion by having to lie face down on the floor. 'We have witnesses for this too, and the evidence of the harm this has caused him.' Another parent, Alexandra Jones, who used to work as a lunchtime supervisor, has also complained to Ofsted. Furious parents at have complained to the school's (pictured) governors and Ofsted after the revelations . She said: 'All the children were whispering about something and then it came out that Sheila had made some of them lie face down in the prayer room while she pretended to ring God on her mobile phone.' Ofsted has asked Wiltshire Council's safeguarding panel to investigate the parents' complaints. In a letter to another parent who cited 'problems' at the school, Ofsted replied: 'The information provided raised concerns about the safety of children. 'Ofsted has shared your concerns with the local authority so they can progress these safeguarding concerns as they consider appropriate.' The school, which was rated as 'needing improvements' at its last Ofsted review in February 2013, is due to receive inspectors for a fresh assessment within a few days. The education watchdog said it was not willing to comment further. Colette Culligan, chairman of the governors, said: 'We are aware of an allegation against one of the teaching staff. 'In order to follow due process, all inquiries regarding this issue need to be directed to Wiltshire Council. The school, founded in 1864 (pictured), is said to be aware of the allegation and the issue has been directed to Wiltshire Council. The local authority says it will need to receive a letter from Ofsted before investigating . 'This is to ensure that any investigation currently being conducted is not unduly influenced.' A Wiltshire Council spokesman said: 'Once we have received the letter from Ofsted we will look into any concerns raised.' On the school's website, Mrs Jones claims in her welcome message that the faith school is 'built on gospel values of love, tolerance, forgiveness and compassion'. She adds: 'We aim to be a loving community which is inspired by the life and teaching of Jesus Christ.' The school was founded in 1864 when a group of sisters opened a Roman Catholic 'poor school' in an improvised Roman Catholic chapel and has been called St Joseph's since 1886. It has previously come under fire in another row where teachers called for Mrs Jones to resign after she was accused of being a 'liability' by parents. Governors said in February they had investigated but dismissed the complaints and agreed lessons needed to be learned. A number of parents came forward to say they were no longer happy with the school, which was once considered one of the best in the area.","Shelia Jones is St Joseph's Roman Catholic primary school's headteacher .

"The deaths of three people who developed a foodborne illness linked to some Blue Bell ice cream products has prompted the Texas icon's first product recall in its 108-year history. Five people, in all, developed listeriosis in Kansas after eating products from one production line at the Blue Bell creamery in Brenham, Texas, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA says listeria bacteria were found in samples of Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Country Cookies, Great Divide Bars, Sour Pop Green Apple Bars, Cotton Candy Bars, Scoops, Vanilla Stick Slices, Almond Bars and No Sugar Added Moo Bars. Scroll down for video . Five people, in all, developed listeriosis in Kansas after eating products from one production line at the Blue Bell creamery in Brenham, Texas . Blue Bell says its regular Moo Bars were untainted, as were its half gallons, quarts, pints, cups, three-gallon ice cream and take-home frozen snack novelties. There appeared to be some uncertainty as to where the patients acquired the listeria bacterial infection. According to a Friday statement from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all five of the people sickened were receiving treatment for unrelated health issues at the same Kansas hospital before developing listeriosis, 'a finding that strongly suggests their infections (with listeria bacteria) were acquired in the hospital,' the CDC said. Of those five, information was available from four on what foods they had eaten in the month before the infection. All four had consumed milkshakes made with a single-serving Blue Bell ice cream product called 'Scoops' while they were in the hospital, the CDC said. 'Scoops,' as well as the other suspect Blue Bell items, are mostly food service items and not produced for retail, said Paul Cruse, CEO of the Brenham creamery. Blue Bell says its regular Moo Bars were untainted, as were its half gallons, quarts, pints, cups, three-gallon ice cream and take-home frozen snack novelties . The CDC said the listeria isolated from specimens taken from four of the five patients at Via Christi St. Francis hospital in Wichita, Kansas, matched strains isolated from Blue Bell products obtained this year in South Carolina and Texas. The five patients became ill with listeriosis during their hospitalizations for unrelated causes between December 2013 and January 2015, said hospital spokeswoman Maria Loving. 'Via Christi was not aware of any listeria contamination in the Blue Bell Creameries ice cream products and immediately removed all Blue Bell Creameries products from all Via Christi locations once the potential contamination was discovered,' Loving said in a statement Friday to The Associated Press. Via Christi has eight hospitals in Kansas and Oklahoma. Blue Bell handles all of its own distribution and customer service, Cruse said, so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves, most of them institutional, as soon as it was alerted to the South Carolina contamination Feb. 13. Cruse did not suspect handling of those products after they left the Central Texas creamery. 'The only time it can be contaminated is at the time of production,' he said. That contamination has been traced to a machine that extrudes the ice cream into forms and onto cookies, and that machine remains off line, he said. All products now on store and institution shelves are safe and wholesome, Cruse said. However, 'Contaminated ice cream products may still be in the freezers of consumers, institutions, and retailers, given that these products can have a shelf life of up to 2 years,' the CDC statement said. Blue Bell handles all of its own distribution and customer service, Cruse said, so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves, most of them institutional . CDC recommends that consumers do not eat products that Blue Bell Creameries removed from the market, and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them. Listeriosis is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes, the CDC said. The disease primarily affects pregnant women and their newborns, older adults, and people with immune systems weakened by cancer, cancer treatments, or other serious conditions (like diabetes, kidney failure, liver disease, and HIV). Rarely, people without these risk factors are affected. A person with listeriosis usually has fever and muscle aches, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Almost everyone who is diagnosed with listeriosis has invasive infection, meaning the bacteria spread from their intestines to the blood, causing bloodstream infection, or to the central nervous system, causing meningitis. Although people can sometimes develop listeriosis up to 2 months after eating contaminated food, symptoms usually start within several days. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics, the CDC said.","Five people total develop listeriosis in Kansas after eating products from the production line at the Blue Bell creamery in Brenham, Texas .

"Ecstatic mom Sarah Palin is over the moon with her daughter Bristol's engagement to 'American hero' and Medal of Honor winner Sgt Dakota Meyer. The former Alaska governor and one-time Vice Presidential candidate wrote a gushing response to the news on Saturday, hours after Bristol, 24, announced that she and the 26-year-old Marine were to be wed. Palin wrote on Facebook that she and the rest of her clan are 'honored to welcome Dakota into our family'. Welcome to the family! Sarah Palin posted a gushing response to the engagement of her daughter Bristol, right, to Sgt Dakota Meyer, left . Gushing: Sarah Palin and Meyer met while filming Palin's Amazing America series, above. She had invited the Medal of Honor winner to appear in the first season's final episode, filmed in Alaska . Announcement: Bristol, 24, shared her wedding plans with the world by posting the above photograph of her and Meyer kissing. He proposed at a pop concert on Friday evening in the Hard Rock Casino, Las Vegas . Palin also outed her future son-in-law as a die-hard traditionalist, revealing how he flew to Alaska a week before the proposal to ask Bristol's father, Todd Palin, and grandfather, Chuck Heath Snr, for their permission. The Republican poster girl was herself a key part of their first meeting. In the post she took the chance to recount her role bringing the two together by inviting Meyer to Alaska to film an episode of her Amazing America TV show. The post came as Meyer himself spoke out about his proposal, which he made on one knee at a concert by pop group Rascal Flatts on Friday evening in the Hard Rock Casino, Las Vegas. Noting that Bristol 'makes me a better man', he said he 'can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her and Tripp', her six-year-old son. Tripp was born to Bristol in 2008, when she was just 18, following her high-profile teen pregnancy, which was announced soon after Palin's bid for Vice President. In recent weeks Tripp and Meyer have been pictured playing together. Meyer also addressed the speed of their engagement, less than a year after they first met, saying: 'Marines aren't trained to stand around and let the grass grow under their feet'. It is unclear how long the pair have been dating, but in her engagement announcement Bristol implied they only saw one another infrequently at first. Social media pictures of the pair together only started appearing a few months ago. New family: Meyer is pictured above with Bristol and her six-year-old son, Tripp. Bristol has written repeatedly of how well Meyer gets along with her son, who was fathered by former flame Levi Johnston, to whom she was engaged twice before . Rock: Bristol followed the announcement image with this picture of her engagement ring . Bristol, even more excited than her mother, announced the engagement yesterday night on her Instagram page in a flurry of exclamation marks. She posted an image of the pair kissing, alongside the words: 'Truly the luckiest girl in the world, cannot wait to marry this man!!!!' It was quickly followed by a monochrome image of her finger adorned with a ring. The mother-of-one then uploaded a picture of her engagement ring and wrote a piece on her blog. It read: 'Last night, Sgt Dakota Meyer proposed and I said yes! 'Dakota came to Alaska to film Amazing America with my mom last year. He met Tripp during that time, and I’ve seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. Excitement: Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, also gushed about the forthcoming nuptials . 'He’s visited us in Alaska, and I’ve visited his wonderful family in Kentucky. He’s wonderful with Tripp and I’m so proud to be marrying him. 'He’s so romantic! He asked me to marry him at a Rascal Flatts concert. The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated Bless the Broken Road to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed! 'It’s amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God’s hands. He really is good and His plans are so much greater than our own.' Kentucky native Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, said he is happier than he has been in years. First round: Palin also congratulated the pair on Twitter not long after the announcement . He wrote: 'Coming back from Afghanistan there were days I thought I may never be happy again, and I know there's a lot of you out there who know that feeling. 'We only have one life to live and we have to do our best to live it the right way, and Bristol makes me a better man. 'I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her and Tripp. For the first time in a long time I can honestly say the best is yet to come! Thanks to everyone for your words of kindness and support. It means a ton to us.' Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four of his missing soldiers. American hero: Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor by Barack Obama in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four missing soldiers . He was able to rescue 36 troops and kill eight Taliban attackers despite being shot in the arms. Although he did not save the four men he set out to find, he recovered their bodies and brought each of them to safety. He caused a stir in December for taunting ISIS members on social media - calling them cowards. He also wrote: 'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club.' Since her mother's failed bid to become vice president in 2008, Bristol has appeared on Dancing with the Stars and featured in her own Lifetime show about raising her son, titled Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp. She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far. Bristol broke up with ex-partner Johnston in 2009 and started an intense custody battle. However, in the midst of the battle, they also briefly reunited and were engaged again. But the match was short-livde and the two broke up again in the summer of 2010. Johnston has since married day-care worker Sunny Oglesby. The couple have two children together, Breeze Beretta and Indy Rae.

"Gordon Brown was last night accused of having a 'perverted sense of reality' after claiming Britain would be like North Korea if it walked out of Europe. Tory frontbencher Matt Hancock said the former prime minister was in danger of losing 'heads and hearts' by likening the UK outside the EU to Kim Jong Un's pariah state. It came after Mr Brown made an impassioned plea for Britain to stay in the EU in what could be his last House of Commons speech yesterday evening. Tory frontbencher Matt Hancock said the former prime minister Gordon Brown was in danger of losing 'heads and hearts' by likening the UK outside the EU to Kim Jong Un's pariah state . The former PM had earlier claimed leaving Europe would leave the UK 'out in the cold with few friends' and 'no influence' like North Korea. But replying for the Government in the debate, Mr Hancock told the Labour giant: 'Our country has been turned around and is being turned but our country will prosper whatever the institutional relationship with Europe. 'We are a brilliant country with the most enterprising and innovative people in the world, and it ill behoves anyone - least of all (Mr Brown) - to compare Britain's future to a brutal dictatorship like North Korea. 'And comparing Britain to North Korea shows a perverted sense of reality, and indeed you lose heads and hearts when you make such as comparison.' Mr Brown had made the claim in a newspaper article published before last night's debate. In the Commons Mr Brown claimed that Tory Eurosceptics and Ukip have instigated a 'culture war' urging disaffected Britons to blame foreigners for economic problems and so turning people against Europe. The former prime minister railed against those on the right who have sought to address voters' concerns about globalisation by creating a 'siege mentality' that pits Britain against the continent, portraying support for Europe as unpatriotic. In what is likely to be his Commons swansong, the Labour giant said the only way progressives can win the 'culture war' to keep Britain in the European Union is by winning hearts as well as minds. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (centre) inspecting the unit 1016 of Korean People's Army Air and Anti-Air Force at an undisclosed location in North Korea . Gordon Brown made an impassioned plea for Britain to stay in the EU in what could be his last House of Commons speech yesterday evening. It came after he claimed Britain would be like Kim Jong Un's pariah state (above) Mr Brown cautioned against a 'London establishment-led, corporate financed' statistics-heavy campaign by 'elites' against leaving the EU as 'technical arguments are not enough to trump cultural grievances'. Instead those who want to remain in the EU must passionately affirm that 'Britain is not Britain' unless it plays a leading role in shaping Europe, as it has for centuries - 'championing toleration, liberty and social responsibility' before any other country. In a passionate speech which a handful of Tories attempted to derail with heckles about the former chancellor's record in government, Mr Brown called for Britain to lead a progressive movement in Europe to give globalisation 'a human face'. He told the Commons: 'There is no doubt that millions of our fellow citizens feel more insecure than ever because of what is the bewildering pace and destructiveness of what to them often seems an out of control and uncontrollable global economy, and they are looking for someone or something to shelter, insulate, protect and cushion them from these bewildering, often alien forces that have taken their livelihoods on occasion from them. Business minister Matt Hancock attacked Mr Brown in the Commons yesterday . 'As they look for someone to hold responsible, and now they are being urged to turn what started off as economic protest, rather than a cultural prejudice, into a culture war - the main weapon of which is to blame foreigners, target immigrants and engender a siege mentality against the outsider.' Mr Brown stressed the need for an emotional argument against Europe and a message that is bigger than the business case for staying in the EU. He said: 'I have to say that in this culture war, arid statistics about exports and investment from a well-meaning, London establishment-led, corporate-financed campaign of 'the great and the good', who will be accused of being elites who don't understand Britain, will appear to many voters no match for the cultural charge from the right that Britain has ceased to be the Britain that they know and love. 'You cannot win in a culture war which asserts Britain is no longer a country you recognise just with fact sheets about the percentages of falls and rises in business investment. Technical arguments are not enough to trump cultural grievances. 'When you are fighting back in a culture war that others have started, you must take on strongly felt sets of beliefs with other strongly felt sets of beliefs. 'And if we are to win hearts as well as minds, our core message must be bigger than the business case, and bigger than even making the principled case for engagement. 'We must tell the British people not just about our patriotism and our historic role at the hinges of history but how through putting our enduring British values to work, we will lead in and shape the future of this continent. 'And that Britain which has always championed toleration, liberty and social responsibility before any country in Europe - and, as far back as the days of Adam Smith, invented the idea of civic society and mutual obligation, influencing Europe massively in the process - this Britain is ready once again to lead a progressive movement, mobilising Europe in what is the greatest challenge we face.

Replying for the Government, Mr Hancock paid tribute to Mr Brown as 'a chancellor who dominated both the Treasury and this House and a prime minister who never gave less than his all in service of his nation'. The Tory minister said: 'It falls to me to respond for the Government on this historic occasion of what may be the last speech in this House by you. 'Before responding in detail to the case you have made I think it's only right that the House acknowledge this moment. 'Since you entered this House in 1983 you have been a warrior for social justice, a master of the despatch box, a chancellor who dominated both the Treasury and this House and a prime minister who never gave less than his all in service of his nation. 'You have been a brilliant debater, besting Nigel Lawson in his prime, and humbling a long series of opponents throughout your career.' But Mr Hancock criticised Mr Brown for standing against an in-out referendum on Britain's EU membership, as promised by the Conservatives.","Tory minister Matt Hancock said Mr Brown was  losing 'heads and hearts'

"A handcuffed man stole a police SUV in Southern California and sped away, forcing officers to commandeer a tow-truck and pursue him at high speed for 10 miles, authorities have said. The suspect crashed the California Highway Patrol (CHP) cruiser in the woods in the Fallbrook area and hid 'in a bush' for an hour-and-a-half before being recaptured, Channel 10 News reported. When Aaron Teruya, 25, was found, he was still wearing handcuffs. He faces charges driving under the influence, stealing a vehicle and resisting arrest. Scroll down for video . Busted: Aaron Teruya, 25, told reporters, 'I was just being stupid and I didn't want to go to jail' You're nicked: the police SUV was found in the woods. Teruya was found in a bush, an hour-and-a-half later . CHP Officer Jim Bettencourt told U-T San Diego that police were first alerted when Teruya, of San Diego, was spotted driving his 2000 Ford Focus 'at high rate of speed and weaving in and out of traffic' on Interstate 15 south of Temecula. Teruya hit a truck towing a trailer and was apprehended by police. He was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The suspect was handcuffed and put in the front seat of a police SUV, while a tow-truck was called to remove his 2000 Ford Focus. While the officer was talking to the tow-truck's driver, Teruya pulled the handcuffs up around his legs, got behind the wheel of the patrol car and sped away, Bettencourt said. The arresting officer got into the tow truck and  chased his own patrol car for 10 miles along the freeway. Teruya steered the police SUV onto westbound state Route 76, then turned off onto a dirt road near Gird Road. He then crashed into a large rock, left the vehicle and and ran into the woods where he hid for an hour-and-a-half. According to U-T San Diego, additional deputies from Riverside and San Diego counties and canine units were scrambled to join the manhunt. Eventually, Teruya was located and taken back into custody. He was transferred to the Southwest Detention Center in Riverside County, where he faces charges including driving under the influence, stealing a vehicle and resisting arrest. 'I put the cuffs in front of me, and I got in front, put it in gear, and the next thing I knew I was driving,' Teruya told Channel 10 News as he was being led away. 'I was just being stupid and I didn't want to go to jail, that's pretty much it.' When asked how he felt while hiding in the bush, Teruya said: 'I was scared.' Brazen: on Facebook, Teruya suggested that people should 'live life knowing you truely (sic) have no regrets' Scene of the crime: the section of Interstate 15 south of Temecula, California, where the chase unfolded . The journalist who interviewed him on camera, Dan Haggerty of Channel 10, expressed his amazement that Teruya 'spilled his guts' to the media while being led to jail. 'To say I was surprised that this guy stopped and spilled his guts for our camera while being taken to jail would be an understatement,' he said. 'Then again, he did steal a CHP cruiser, crash it in these woods in Fallbrook, and hide in a bush for an hour-and-a-half before being re-arrested. 'Clearly he wasn't having a day of good decision making.'","Aaron Teruya of San Diego was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, but jumped into the front seat of a police car and sped away .

"A regional benefits cap, taxes on disability benefits and a limit on child benefit to the first two children could be introduced in a new welfare squeeze after the general election. Leaked Whitehall documents show officials have drawn up a series of options that could be used to further reduce the benefits bill. All the main parties are committed to money-saving welfare reform, but the Conservatives have pledged to make the deepest cuts, taking £12billion out of welfare in the next Parliament. A regional benefits cap, taxes on disability benefits and a limit on child benefit to the first two children could be introduced in a new welfare squeeze . A two-year freeze on some benefits and a lowering of the new benefits cap – the maximum amount in benefits a household can receive – from £26,000 to £23,000 are already on the agenda. The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests those measures would save £2billion a year by 2017-18. But documents leaked to the BBC also suggested a regional benefits cap, an idea backed by Labour, as one possibility. The £23,000 limit would vary across the country, with the highest sum paid in London, where housing costs are greatest. It is said that limiting child benefit to the first two children for future claimants would save £1billion a year. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the proposals were not Tory party policy . The documents also proposed taxing disability benefits – a move that would prove highly controversial. This would mean better-off claimants losing some of their payments, and would save £1.5billion a year. Carer’s allowance could be restricted to the most needy, saving £1billion. And the contributory element of employment and support allowance and jobseekers’ allowance would be reined in. Currently claimants who have paid enough National Insurance contributions can get the benefits with little means-testing. Some 30 per cent of claimants, over 300,000 families, would lose about £80 per week, saving taxpayers £1.3billion. Council tax support, meanwhile, could be incorporated into the new universal credit, which is gradually replacing all the main out-of-work benefits and tax credits. And replacing the industrial injuries compensation scheme with an insurance policy for employees would save £1billion. The Tories insisted that the proposals were not party policy and had been prepared by officials considering all options for the next government, of whatever make-up. ‘It’s wrong to suggest that any of this is part of our plan,’ said a spokesman for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Labour Work and Pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves, said: ‘These plans were drawn up for Conservative ministers to deliver their extreme cuts plan. The Tories now need to come clean about what cuts they plan to make.’","Leaked Whitehall documents show plans to further reduce the benefits bill .

"Arsenal winger Theo Walcott and his wife Melanie have spoken out over the distressing ordeal they had to go through following the birth of their son Finley. The couple, speaking to Hello! magazine, learned their newborn baby had a heart defect shortly after his birth just under a year ago.

Theo Walcott and his wife Melanie have spoken out about the birth of their son Finley . Melanie said: 'Finley had a routine check and they found a murmur, which, again is normal. But it should go after 24 hours. 'But it didn't and it was discovered he had a valve that wasn't working properly. Photo of Finley that Theo posted to Facebook shortly after he was born last year . 'Basically, the heart was having to work really hard to get the blood to his lungs, which meant that the right side of his heart was getting bigger. 'Theo and I were so new to it all, you suddenly feel so vulnerable because it is all taken out of your control.' She continued: 'You've got this little person who is the most precious thing in the world and who you have this overwhelming urge to protect. It was a scary and emotional time. 'It was the longest two and a half hours of our lives but the staff were fantastic. Theo and I just tried to keep strong for each other.' Finley, who will turn one on April 10, has made a full recovery since the operation at Royal Brompton hospital in London. During the interview, Melanie revealed that Finley is following in his father's footsteps by kicking footballs from his baby walker. She also said the pair have matching dimples and that they both scrunch up their toes when they are relaxed.

"A real-life Paddington bear who suffered such brutal treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and most of her fur is looking for a new home – with the support of the creator of her marmalade-loving fictional relative. The bear, called Cholita, was in a ‘deplorable condition’ when she was rescued from a circus  in Peru last week by London-based Animal Defenders International (ADI). The group is now appealing for funds to fly her to a sanctuary in the United States. Scroll down for video .

Horrific neglect: Animal Defenders International's raid near Piura in northern Peru last week was one of a number across South America . Like Paddington from ‘deepest, darkest Peru’, Cholita is a spectacled or Andean bear, an endangered species native to the region. Last night Michael Bond, the author of the bestselling children’s books, gave his endorsement to the campaign to transport her to the US. He said: ‘Bears, especially from Peru, obviously have a special place in my life. ‘It is such a horrendous story.

A heart-breaking video released by ADI shows the bear in a government zoo with barely any of her thick black body hair left, the result of stress she suffered at the circus. The group said that she had been crammed in a box just 5ft by 5ft in the circus, while her fingers were cut down to stumps and her teeth deliberately shattered so she could not defend herself. The organisation's president Jan Creamer said: ‘Her butchered paws, broken teeth and hairless body illustrate more than any words possibly can the terrible suffering poor Cholita endured in the circus. ‘She would have spent years there confined, likely chained, and forced to perform tricks for the audience.’ The group's raid near Piura in northern Peru last week was one of a number across South America. It is now planning to get Cholita on to a flight taking 33 rescued circus lions from Peru to a new life in Colorado next month, the biggest airlift of its kind ever undertaken.

"A Labour MP is to repay expenses after claiming the cost of a poppy wreath to honour the war dead on Remembrance Day. Sarah Champion admitted the claim 'should never have been made' and will return the £17 to the expenses watchdog this week. The MP, who was the star of a documentary about life in the Commons, billed the taxpayer for the tribute last November. Labour MP Sarah Champion billed the taxpayer £17 for a poppy wreath for Remembrance Day . According to official releases from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, Miss Champion submitted the claim for 'Wreath for Remembrance Sunday', describing it as 'necessary expenses to 11/11/14'. IPSA paid the £17, despite MPs being banned from claiming for wreaths. Miss Champion was elected as MP for Rotherham in 2012 after Labour's Denis Macshane quit before being jailed over his expenses. The revelation about the wreath is embarrassing for an MP who has built a reputation for railing against the Westminster Establishment. Andy Silvester, from the Taxpayers' Alliance, told The Sun: 'Trying to put the bill on somebody else to honour our servicemen and women is downright low. 'And then IPSA approving it shows just how out of touch this monster of a quango is.' The Rotherham MP admitted the claim 'should never have been made' and will return the £17 to the expenses watchdog this week . Miss Champion told the newspaper: 'The claim should never have been made so I'll reimburse IPSA on Monday.' When details of MPs' expense claims were leaked in 2009, it emerged a number of senior politicians had claimed taxpayers' money to pay for wreaths. Labour's Ed Balls put in claims for two wreaths worth £33 in August 2007, but the Commons fees office wrote back stating that the Commons department of finance and administration 'disallows costs relating to wreaths and other related expenses'. Tory Boris Johnson and former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy also claimed for the cost of a Remembrance wreath. An IPSA spokesman said: 'We publish all details of what has happened and also what MPs claim. In this case, we will be seeking a repayment from the MP.'","Rotherham MP submitted expense claim for November 11, 2014 .

"The photographs show Kerrie  Cartmill gazing down at her tiny newborn son, who is nuzzled into her chest. Though little bigger than a bag of sugar and surrounded by tubes and wires, he is sleeping peacefully. But while the picture is one of serenity, the pictures marked a frightening time for Mrs Cartmill and her husband Stuart. Their son's health was deteriorating rapidly, and they knew these precious days could be the only time they would ever have with their him. Kerrie and Stuart Cartmill are seen (left and right) cradling their newborn son Matthew to their chests. He was born with a rare condition which sees 90 per cent of babies die within the first five days of their lives . Matthew was born with Trisomy 13, a rare chromosomal disorder which cause multiple congenital abnormalities which result in severe physical and mental impairment . Matthew, from Newry, Northern Ireland, suffers from a rare condition called Trisomy 13, which sees 90 per cent of babies die within the first five days of their lives. Incredibly, Matthew beat the odds and has lived to see his first birthday, a milestone doctors feared he might never reach. Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal disorder which can lead to multiple congenital abnormalities which result in severe physical and mental impairment. It affects only one in 16,000 births, and it is so rare that Matthew is currently the only person in Northern Ireland with the condition. In the first year of his life, he spent 170 days in hospital and has had medical appointments every day. His family have committed themselves to caring for their only child and Mrs Cartmill, 29, gave up her job as a primary school teacher to care for her son. She said: 'We've all had such a tough year and Matthew has spent nearly half of his life in hospital. But we are now looking to give him more stability and a routine at home. Trisomy 13, or Patau syndrom, is a chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 13 in every cell. The condition causes multiple congenital abnormalities which result in severe physical and mental impairment. It occurs in  one in 16,000 live births and is the third most common autosomal trisomy in newborns. A couple are more at risk of having a child with the condition if they have a family history of the condition, risk also rises with maternal age. Many babies with Trisomy 13 are stillborn or die within the first few days after being born - the life expectancy of affected babies is just 2.5 days. About 50 per cent of babies survive for longer than a week and only five to ten per cent survive for longer than a year. Features of the condition include, low birth weight, heart defects, facial defects, severe learning difficulties, problems controlling breathing, deafness, hernias, polycystic kidneys and abnormal hands and feet. 'Our plans as a family have changed as we give Matthew every bit of our time and energy. We don't know what the future holds, we just take every day as it comes.' During the pregnancy, Mr and Mrs Cartmill refused genetic testing because of the risk of miscarriage - and say they knew that whatever happened, it would not have changed their minds about going ahead with the pregnancy. Immediately after Matthew was born, five weeks early by an emergency Caesarean, doctors knew something was wrong. He was sent for genetic testing when he was two days old, and three weeks later the family found out he had Trisomy 13. Mrs Cartmill said: 'We were terrified when we got the results back as doctors didn’t really explain what it meant for Matthew.' They explained that Trisomy, which is also known as Patau syndrome, is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 13 in every cell. The condition affects the heart, brain, spinal cord, eyes and muscles and causes the sufferer numerous physical abnormalities as well as severe intellectual disabilities. For the first year of his life, Matthew saw paediatricians, neurologists and dietitians almost every day. He still has daily appointments which can sometimes be with a specialist, or for physiotherapy,  speech therapy or sensory play. He is currently on a respiratory monitor to check his breathing, and is taking medication for seizures, iron deficiency and acid reflux. He also suffers from a defect to his optic nerve, which causes problems with his vision, and he has regular eye appointments. The family have just celebrated Matthew's first birthday, a milestone doctors feared he would never reach . Matthew's parents say their son, who has sensory and developmental delays, as well as problems with his vision, is growing in strength. His parents have started fundraising for sensory toys to aid his development . But despite his ongoing medical problems, he  is one of only 5 to 10 per cent of children with the condition to live past their first year. The condition is so rare doctors do not know what the prognosis will be for the future, but stress that the disease is severely disabling. But Mr and Mrs Cartmill are determined to prove everyone wrong, and say Matthew is growing in strength all the time. She said: 'He's our superstar. He is developing his own personality now and is so much fun to be around. 'Now Matthew has reached one we just want to cut down the travelling round the country and give Matthew a better quality of life.' Matthew still has daily appointments for physiotherapy, speech therapy or sensory play . The family have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support from the community and have started fundraising for sensory toys to aid his development. They are hoping the toys will add much needed normality to Matthew's life and give him something to look forward to. Mrs Cartmill said: 'Our consultant is happy that he is stable at the moment and has given us the go ahead to be more physical with him. 'We have stepped up Matthew's physio and are already seeing positive signs. 'We hope to have sensory toys so that Matthew can enjoy play like every other baby.'

"As he watched President Obama deliver his sixth State of the Union address, Dr Ben Carson reportedly called him 'a psychopath'. The 63-year-old neurosurgeon - who is believed to be preparing for a Republican presidential nomination next year - allegedly made the comments while watching the address with his chief advisor Armstrong Williams. Williams had remarked that Obama looked 'elegant' on the night. To which Carson replied: 'Like most psychopaths. That's why they're successful. That's the way they look. They all look great.' Scroll down for video . Ben Carson (left) called Obama a well-dressed 'psychopath' as he gave the State of the Union address . Carson's comments were reported by GQ in an article which added that 'casually branding the president a psychopath is exactly the sort of talk that strikes a chord—and just the thing that has made Carson a sensation in the GOP.' Later in the conversation, Carson had apparently exclaimed that Obama sold Americans 'a lie'. He reportedly said: 'He's trying to sell what he thinks is not true! He's sitting there saying, 'These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.'' And it's not the first time Carson has courted controversy with his critical comments of the president since he entered politics two years ago. After Carson's advisor said the President (pictured) looked 'elegant' delivering the address, Carson reportedly responded: 'Like most psychopaths. That's why they're successful' He has previously said that Obamacare is 'the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery'. Earlier this month, he argued that homosexuality is a choice because some people enter prison straight and leave gay. And last month, Carson told the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C. that the Democrats now see African-Americans' support as an entitlement and choose to 'keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.' Born in inner-city Detroit, Carson overcame his circumstances to become a surgeon. He became famous as the first surgeon to successfully separate conjoined twins joined at the head. In recent years, his focus has been on politics - and he is known for being an outspoken conservative Republican.","Carson is believed to be preparing for Republican presidential nomination .

One tribute reads: 'To my sister Levi, I love you lots. Love Cameron.' Another says: 'To my best cousin Levi. Love you so much. Love from Becca. RIP.' The family are still too upset to comment on the young girl's death. Neighbours living near to the site of the crash had told how they were woken by the sound of a bang and a scream. A spokesman said the firefighters were initially called to reports of a car hitting a tree with people trapped inside. Two fire engines were then called to the scene, where firefighters had to cut casualties out of the car. All casualties were taken to Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport. Police said it was too early to confirm who was driving the car and where the 15-year-old was sat. They also added that it was also too early to say whether seatbelts were being worn or where the group had been before the crash took place.

"Alicia Blanco-Clements, six, pictured with her mother Aimee, was called 'pirate girl' by a teacher . A six-year-old schoolgirl who has to wear an eye patch due to severe visual problems was left in tears after a teacher called her 'pirate girl' when he couldn't remember her name. Alicia Blanco-Clements was standing in the wrong queue to leave the packed assembly hall at Springfield Primary School in Chelmsford, Essex, when Jona Davies made the comment. Her older sister Olivia, 11, spotted her sister in the wrong place before hearing their deputy head teacher call her 'pirate girl' as he tried to attract her attention in front of the school last Wednesday. She said the ordeal was the talk of the school and that students from different classes were talking about what Mr Davies, 44, had said to her little sister. He allegedly sought out Olivia, a Year 6 pupil, in the playground to explain his actions - but he didn't apologise to Alicia directly. She said: 'My sister was queuing in the wrong place and that’s when Mr Davies called her ""pirate girl"". He forgot her name and so he was trying to get her attention.' That evening, Olivia explained to her mother Aimee, 30, a midwife at Queen's Hospital in Romford, what had happened. Mrs Blanco-Clements said: 'I was absolutely horrified. Alicia is normally smiling from ear to ear when I pick her up from school but on Wednesday she was really solemn and I could tell she was upset. 'It was only when my other daughter Olivia told me what had happened that I went marching into the school to confront him. 'I couldn't believe that someone with such authority could be so ignorant and insensitive. We spoke but he didn't seem sincere.' Alicia has suffered from an impairment in her left eye since she was two and is also extremely short sighted and is only able to see about a metre in front of her due to the condition termed 'lazy eye'. The patch, which she wears for six hours a day, helps to maintain the 20/20 vision in her right eye. Jona Davies allegedly called the six-year-old 'pirate girl' after forgetting her name and trying to get her attention as she was in the wrong queue after assembly . Specialists at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, have warned the family that if the eye has not improved by the time Alicia is eight-years-old, she will be 'stuck' with that level of vision for the rest of her life. Mrs Blanco-Clements, who also has an 18-month-old son named Teddy, added: 'Alicia is so, so, vulnerable because of her eye patch. It has made her very self conscious and timid anyway. 'So to have that comment said in front of the whole school was the worst thing imaginable. It could make life so much harder for her - she said ""mummy, it's made me feel scared and sad"". The childhood condition amblyopia, or more commonly known as a 'lazy eye', occurs when the vision in an eye doesn't develop properly. This usually means that the child can see less clearly out of one eye and relies more on the 'good' eye. David Allamby, a leading London-based laser eye surgeon, explained the condition develops when the brain connections responsible for vision are not made properly. 'You need good vision in each eye to develop clear vision,' he said. 'That develops during the first six or seven years of life. The occipital lobe at the back of the brain processes visual imagery and it learns to see by getting clear images from the retina and through the optic nerve. 'That process is learned over time and if anything interrupts that, such as a squint, the eye can't see as well as the other and the brain doesn't get the image it needs to process clear vision. 'The developing will stop at the age of six or seven so an eye patch has to be done before then to stop it being permanent.' He noted that there is a social stigma attached to eye patches and in some cases using eye drops to temporarily impair the vision in the strong eye also works effectively. Dr Susan Blakeney, clinical adviser to the College of Optometrist, added: 'We put a patch on the good eye to force the bad eye to work and improve the vision. 'Having a lazy eye is like having a low megapixel camera - it's not well defined. Eye patches increases the number of 'megapixels'. 'The earlier it's noticed the more effective the treatment can be, so if anyone notices a turn in the eye or the child not paying attention or poor hand eye co-ordination they should make a visit to the opticians. Also, parents who had childhood eye problems should consider taking their children for a test early.' 'I am worried she will now be subjected to bullying because of the comment as the children will have heard what the deputy head teacher said and think it is somehow acceptable to behave like that.' Mrs Blanco-Clements, a mother-of-three, and her HGV driver husband Liam, 29, confronted Mr Davies, who is also a triathlete, at the school later that day and were disappointed by his 'flippant' attitude. She added: 'When I found out what had happened, I went straight to the school to speak to the headmistress. 'She was not available so I actually spoke with Mr Davies - he came into the room and said ""I think I know what this is about"". 'I said ""what on earth do you think you are doing talking like that to a child with a visual impairment, who is scared already, in front of the whole assembly?"" 'He said he did not know her name and did not know whether to call her ""patch"" so instead called her pirate girl. 'I just could not believe I was hearing this from a deputy head teacher. He did apologise, but he said 'there's nothing I can do about it now' which seemed very flippant to me.' But she added that although her husband was fuming with the response, they did not want the father-of-three to lose his job. She added: 'He has a family to think about but he should undergo some kind of awareness training to make him understand his actions. 'We're so protective of Alicia because of everything she's been through. She's already got enough on her plate. 'We went back later that afternoon and had a meeting with the head teacher, but it was too late by then. The wrong message had already been sent out to the children that bullying is okay.' The couple attended the school for a second time, where they were able to speak to headmistress, Sharon Tyler. Mrs Blanco-Clements added: 'Her jaw was on the floor when I told her about what happened as she had not even been told about it. 'She said the school would be reminding Mr Davies of its policies. They sent me a short letter about what happened which, to be honest, is a load of rubbish and says to me that they have not taken the matter seriously.' Sharon Tyler, the school's head teacher, said: 'We accept that what was said was inappropriate and have apologised unreservedly to the pupil and her parents. 'While the comment was not malicious or intended to cause offence, the teacher in question has been reminded of our expectations. 'As a school, we actively promote equality and I can assure all parents this was an isolated incident which will not be repeated.'","Alicia Blanco-Clements was standing in wrong queue at end of assembly .

"A woman who was stabbed in a 'horrific' attack has been identified as Prabha Arun . A woman who was stabbed in a 'horrific' attack on her way home from work on Saturday night has been identified as Prabha Arun. The 41-year-old was discovered by three people passing by the small alleyway near Amos Street in Westmead shortly after 9.30pm, where she was on the phone when the random attack happened. In a cruel twist, the mother of one was speaking to her husband when she cried out: 'I think I’ve been stabbed' as he listened helplessly over the phone while his wife was brutally attacked  just metres from her home,' The Daily Telegraph reports. The IT consultant hopped off at Parramatta train station, walked along Argyle Street and then onto Park Parade before taking the footpath next to the golf course where she was attacked just metres from her Westmead home. 9News reports the working mother was expected to fly home to India in June to see her husband and their 10-year-old daughter after being apart for three years. But now, her husband is reportedly on his way from India after the tragic news. Scroll down for video .

Nearby resident Arvand Amirian told 9News he had found Ms Arun with blood all over her body after hearing 'crying screams' that 'didn't sound normal'. 'There was blood covering her face, her neck, her chest - her chest wasn't even moving so that's when I assumed she was gone,' Amirian said. Her  friend Sarada Angadimani, who Ms Arun is currently staying with, told 9News: 'Prabha was a really hard working, beautiful person. And, most importantly, a loving mother.' 'I hope God gives the family enough strength to endure this pain.' She was treated at the scene before being taken to Westmead Hospital, where she later died after suffering a 'life threatening injury'.

"A naked rampage in California has left residents of an apartment complex in shock after a bare man ran around their parking lot at night and smashed headfirst into vehicles. Clarisa Vidrio of Anaheim told KTLA News that she spotted 21-year-old Garrett Smith sprinting towards the trunk of her neighbor's van around 11:30pm on Saturday before he bounced off and did a backwards somersault. Distressed by the scene, she quickly got into her car and attempted to drive off, but a bloodied Smith erratically jumped on her bonnet. Vidrio sped up in a state of panic and dethroned the unclothed rider by bumping into a parked van. 'I saw the guy flying off the car... I literally thought I was going to die that day,' she recalled. Proving her observations, a surveillance camera caught the unusual incident unfold. Footage released, shows Smith getting up and wearily crouching over after he was hit. Another resident from the apartment complex then goes over to greet him before he starts running again. The witness described the scene as 'something beyond his imagination.'

"She posed in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris and had gelato in Cinque Terre in Italy, but the last place Jessica Weller thought she would have her photograph taken was inside a chemotherapy suite in London. The 29-year-old, from Ohakune in New Zealand, had plans to see the world and enjoy her once-in-a-lifetime holiday  around Europe but three months into her trip, she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Rather than head home, the school teacher was determined to continue with her adventure - and even gave the cancer the pet name 'Mr Lumpy' and treated it like a bad travel companion.

'I tried my best to prepare myself for the worst a week prior to getting the results but deep down, I knew it wasn't going to be good news,' she said. 'When the doctors sat me down and told me, it felt like someone was screaming into my ears. 'I felt helpless, completely helpless and numb as if every single ounce of control you had was gone.

'It was already at stage 3 when I discovered it and it was starting to spread into the lymphatic system,' she said. She  received 18 months of chemotherapy treatment, five surgeries, had her eggs frozen and lost all her hair in the process as well as her taste buds.

Despite her battle with cancer, she was determined to continue her travels and keep her mind off the pain by booking more trips to Europe and around the UK. 'Having cancer never dominated my life,' Ms Weller said. 'Obviously like any illness, you have to adjust and make allowances but I just dealt with it when I had to and got on with the life I wanted to live.

"Penny Mellor, 53, (pictured arriving at Chelmsford Crown Court today) is accused of sending abuse online to anti-paedophile campaigner Shy Keenan . An anti-paedophile campaigner was bombarded with online messages claiming she lied in her bestselling misery memoir by a woman who had developed an 'obsession' with her, a court heard. Penny Mellor, 53, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, allegedly attacked Shy Keenan through Twitter, emails and a blog, claiming she had fabricated an account of childhood sexual abuse. Ms Keenan, from Colchester, Essex, who describes herself as a justice campaigner, wrote a book in 2008 called Broken, where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather. The revelation led to the conviction of Stanley Claridge and others in 2002 and Ms Keenan set up her own organisation, Phoenix Post, with campaigner Sara Payne, whose daughter was murdered. She also worked as a columnist for the Sun and revealed her early life on a BBC Newsnight programme. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Mellor accused Ms Keenan of repeatedly lying in her book, claiming she was a fraudster and an attention seeker. Mellor denies stalking Ms Keenan and causing her serious alarm or distress between January 1 and 16 March 2013 by sending tweets, publishing statements about her in emails sent to work associates and carrying out a course of conduct which had a substantial effect on Ms Keenan's day to day activities. Prosecutor Tony Abell, opening the case to the jury, said the law against cyber stalking via social media under which Mellor was being tried only came into effect in January 2013. He said Mellor appeared 'to have developed something of an obsession with Shy Keenan and embarked upon a very personal campaign against her'. He said the tweets were personal and offensive and continued: 'She has accused her repeatedly of lying in the book ""Broken"". 'She has suggested Ms Keenan has groomed individuals, implied that she suffers from Munchausen's By Proxy and referred to her post traumatic stress disorder. 'Emails contain private information which Shy Keenan regards as sensitive, including copies of marriage certificates, addresses and the like.' Shy Keenan (pictured) wrote a book in 2008 called Broken, where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather. Mellor allegedly claimed that Ms Keenan 'repeatedly lied' in her book . Mr Abell said Ms Keenan felt concerned about her own and her family's personal safety because the information might help other people with grudges against her. She had installed extra security and had had to go back on anti-depressants. The jury heard  Mellor was a campaigner against false allegations of Munchausen by Proxy, where parents were the victims of false claims from their own children, for organisation Dare to Care. In 1998 to 1999, Mellor and Ms Keenan were in close communication but they fell out. Ms Keenan thought that Mellor's work might be offering support to real child abusers. The two women didn't have any contact again until late 2012. Mr Abell said the trigger was Ms Keenan writing in her Sun column in October 2012, following the Jimmy Savile scandal, that she had mentioned to Esther Rantzen many years before of rumours about his inappropriate behaviour. Shy Keenan (right) with Dr Sara Payne (left), whose daughter was murdered by a paedophile, work together at her organisation, Phoenix Post . Mellor then began tweeting that Ms Keenan 'had told lies in her book Broken', said the prosecutor. Mellor emailed recipients including the BBC, Newsnight, the Sun, the Guardian, Broken's publisher Hodder & Stoughton and Ms Keenan's literary agent. She was appealing to them to 'investigate' her claims of inaccuracies in Broken and sent 239 tweets from January to March 2013. Mellor is to have accused Ms Keenan of 'lying and cheating for years' and that she 'cons everyone and hides behind that abuse'. The court heard she described the graphic abuse Ms Keenan wrote about in her book as 'titillation' for paedophiles and not the sort of thing a mother should publish for her own children to read. Mellor wrote that Ms Keenan 'seeks attention, she needs to be adored and revered in order to get money', the jury was told. 'That's a flavour of the sort of bile which was coming out of Penny Mellor over this period,' said Mr Abell. ' It sought to attack Ms Keenan's credibility as a victim of sexual abuse, causing her distress and concern by revealing personal information. Mellor was given a verbal warning by Essex Police in December 2012 but after a brief respite, the cyber attacks began again in January. She was arrested on 15 March 2013 and told police her motive was to get Ms Keenan to stop what she was doing. The trial, which is expected to last about two weeks, continues.

"The police should not become a 'scapegoat' for the disappearance of three British schoolgirls who have fled to Syria to join ISIS, David Cameron said today. The Prime Minister insisted politicians, parents, communities and schools all had a responsibility to stop well-educated young Britons joining the brutal regime. His warning came ahead of the family of schoolfriends Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase giving evidence to MPs about what they say are failures by the police. The Prime Minister insisted politicians, parents, communities and schools all had a responsibility to stop well-educated young Britons joining the brutal regime . Police spoke to the three girls just months before they disappeared and found 'no evidence' that they had been radicalised . Officers were deployed to the school as part of counter-terrorism and anti-radicalisation measures after another teenage girl from Bethnal Green Academy in east London fled to join ISIS. In an interview with LBC radio, Mr Cameron said that no institution should be made a 'scapegoat' for the girls' disappearance. 'I think everyone has a role to play. Of course we need the police to act as swiftly as they can, we need Border Force to work as fast as they can. 'But let's be frank about this, when you have got educated British schoolgirls at an outstanding school in Greenwich finding it somehow attractive to get on a plane to travel to Syria to go and live in a country where gay people are being thrown off buildings and British citizens are being beheaded, and appalling brutality is being meted out, we have a problem, clearly, that has got to involve all of us - politicians, parents, communities, schools. 'Everyone has to work together. Let's not pretend this is simply a problem that can be dealt with by policing.' Kadiza Sultana 16, Amira Abase 15 and Shamima Begum 15 are feared to have travelled to Syria via Turkey . The families of the girls have blamed failings by the police for their disappearance last month . Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed as 'nonsense' the suggestion that jihadis like Emwazi had been radicalised by their contact with security services. Mr Cameron told LBC radio: 'The fact is we face a terrorist threat in Britain. That is the opinion of the experts who advise me and set the threat level. 'Our police and security services have a very important role to play to find out about people that could do us harm and to step in and prevent them from doing that. 'Of course we need to work with communities to do that - and we do. 'But I totally reject the idea that police or security service tactics have somehow radicalised people. That is, I think, nonsense.' Campaign group Cage sparked outrage last month with its attempts to justify Emwazi's brutal killings of ISIS hostages. In an extraordinary press conference, the group's research director Asim Qureshi said Kuwait-born Briton Emwazi was a 'beautiful young man', 'extremely gentle' and 'the most humble young person that I ever knew'. The 32-year-old blamed British security services for Emwazi's radicalisation, saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an 'outsider'. The girls' families have called for an apology from Metropolitan Police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe after it emerged that letters were given to the girls to hand on to their parents, rather than being sent directly to them. The letters were sent to inform parents their children had been friends with a pupil who went to Syria weeks earlier and asking for permission to take formal statements. They were handed to the girls on February 5 and found hidden in schoolbooks in their bedrooms after the girls left on February 17. But Mr Cameron insisted: 'If there are lessons to learn about how quick the reactions were, then I know the police will learn them. What I'm trying to say is I think it would be wrong to try and scapegoat any one organisation when you are dealing with something that is so profound. 'What is going wrong when girls at an amazing school somehow want to give up all Britain offers in terms of freedom and democracy and choice and opportunity? I'm not saying our society is perfect, but you can come from anywhere and make it to the top of Britain. We're an amazing country - why do people want to give that up and be part of an appalling brutal death cult? 'That goes to a big question about our country that we've all got to answer, not just the police.' Last month Turkey accused the British authorities of for being too slow to inform it about the three London schoolgirls who travelled to Turkey en route to Syria. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said he hoped the girls would be found, but that it would be Britain, not Turkey, to blame if they were not. But the claims have been rejected by the UK government, who insisted the police and other agencies were quick to act. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond spoke to Turkey's foreign minister on Saturday about what action can be taken to stop would-be jihadists from Western countries crossing the country's border with Syria in order to sign up with Islamic State. He said today: 'Turkey is doing huge amounts and I would like to record publicly our appreciation of the support we get from the Turkish authorities, but we are all learning as we go and I think this particular case of the three schoolgirls from east London has identified some weaknesses and things we can improve,' said the Foreign Secretary. 'But it's also identified some steps that people in the community could take to keep us safe as well. 'Parents have responsibilities, schools and community workers have responsibilities, as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators. 'It's about coming together in this case to protect children - minors, juveniles - who must be protected from themselves, going about something that will be deeply damaging to their own interests as well as our national security interests.'","Prime Minister insists politicians, parents and schools share the burden .

The vile, racist rant, tweeted by user @angeIsleftfoot, read: 'Welbeck is dead to me, the f****** c***…’ The tweet, posted after Welbeck's decisive role in Arsenal's 2-1 Quarter Final victory at Old Trafford, continued with sickening references that are  too offensive to publish here. Sportsmail understands officers in Manchester with specialist training in social media identified the user and passed on the information to Wiltshire Police, who confirmed they have now made an arrest. A spokesman for Wiltshere Police said: 'A 15-year-old male from the Salisbury area was arrested on the evening of March 12 on suspicion of racial abuse. 'He has been released on police bail until April 13. Welbeck was jeered by a minority of United fans after being replaced by Olivier Giroud late in the game . The 24-year-old shakes hands with former team-mate Wayne Rooney (left) after the game . 'He has been bailed to return to Melksham Police station then.' The vitriolic slur was one of a number of disturbing messages posted in the aftermath of Welbeck's triumphant return to United. Some stated that they hoped the 24-year-old, who is from Manchester, would die while one user threatened to kill him. Welbeck was shown the door by United boss Louis van Gaal last year, who claimed he was not good enough. Welbeck spent six seasons at United after coming through the club's youth system . £60m man Angel di Maria (2nd right) was sent off during the game for laying his hands on referee Michael Oliver (2nd left) He seized upon a poor backpass to give Arsenal a lead they would not relinquish and then celebrated in front of the 9,000 visiting supporters - an action which was welcomed by many pundits. Despite isolated boos, Welbeck was applauded from the field by the majority of United fans when he was substituted in the 74th minute. The Twitter account in question is no longer active.

"Sir Philip Green, pictured with his daughter Chloe, has sold the loss-making BHS department chain for just £1 to a little-known investment firm . Retail tycoon Sir Philip Green has sold struggling BHS for just one pound – a fraction of the £200million he paid for it almost 15 years ago. The billionaire had failed to turn the loss-making department store chain around due to fierce competition from rivals. It was bought yesterday by a little-known investment firm called Retail Acquisitions, raising fears for the jobs of 11,000 staff in 171 BHS stores across the country. When asked if their roles were safe, Sir Philip said: ‘I’m a retailer, not a clairvoyant.’ The entrepreneur bought the chain in 2000 when it was called British Home Stores. It joined Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Burton as part of his Arcadia Group. But its furniture and fashion – aimed at older customers – struggled to sell well enough to keep up with rivals. Recent attempts to breathe new life into the chain included introducing food halls in some stores, opening new cafes and selling clothes from some of Arcadia’s other brands. But this failed to kick-start growth, and BHS continued to lose customers to cheaper rivals such as IKEA, as well as more upmarket competitors including John Lewis. Sir Philip said the chain made a cash loss of £45million last year. Analysts estimate that it lost 800,000 shoppers over the past five years. The businessman said he had not been able to give BHS as much attention as he would have liked because of the other brands he owns. ‘I don’t think anything went wrong,’ he said. ‘You try being involved in six businesses. ‘I’m not blaming anybody, but when you are in and out of the business you tend to drift. You can’t be an absentee landlord. It is a challenging marketplace and BHS is in the middle of the market at a time when everyone is discounting.’ He said the business is being handed over in a sound financial position with ‘significant’ cash balances and no debt. Sir Philip put BHS up for sale in January. He refused to confirm the sale price yesterday, but this was widely reported as being £1. He also declined to say whether he had secured an agreement that existing stores and jobs would be safeguarded. ‘I don’t want some article saying they will close them,’ he said. ‘I’m a retailer, not a clairvoyant. People buy companies and people sell companies. They are buying the business to run it as a going concern.’ Fears have been expressed over the job security of more than 11,000 staff employed by BHS . Retail Acquisitions is a new business set up by five directors with little experience in the sector. Chairman Keith Smith, 76, is a former stockbroker. Two other directors are lawyers – one specialising in privacy, who has advised Mike Tyson, Ulrika Jonsson and Hugh Grant. Of the firm’s remaining two directors, one is an unknown Swede and the other appears to be a former racing driver. Mr Smith said: ‘This is a fantastic opportunity to breathe new life into this iconic British high street brand. ‘We are convinced that with strategic and focused support we will return BHS to profitability and safeguard the workforce.’ However, analysts believe the firm may be forced to cut staff. Neil Saunders, a director of research firm Conlumino, said: ‘On the positive side, it is likely the brand will be reinvigorated and see some investment. ‘On the negative side, some restructuring [job cuts] is likely and over the medium term further store closures will likely be required.’","Sir Philip Green has sold BHS for just £1 to Retail Acquisitions .

"The founder and leader of a controversial Atlanta-based megachurch has appealed online for 200,000 people to each donate '$300 or more' so that he can buy a $65 million private jet favored by high-flying billionaires. Reverend Creflo Dollar, 53, is the head of the World Changers Church International, a Christian ministry centered around the prosperity gospel, which preaches that God wants to bless the faithful with earthly riches. The televangelist, who is one of the most prominent African-American preachers in the United States, this week put a five-minute video up on his website pledging for donations for a Gulfstream G650 - which claims to be the fastest plane ever built in civilian aviation - so that 'World Changers Church International can continue to blanket the globe with the Gospel of grace'. Dollar - who is known to own two Rolls Royce's and multi-million dollar homes in Atlanta and New Jersey - last hit headlines in 2012, after being arrested for allegedly attacking his 15-year-old daughter. Open palm: Reverend Creflo Dollar of the World Changers Church International wants 200,000 people from across the world to each donate '$300 or more' so that he can buy the world's fastest private jet . Battling: This notice has been posted on the church's website, pleading for donations so that Dollar can 'continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ' Goal: Dollar wants to spend the $65 million he hopes to make in donations on a Gulfstream G650 business jet, a plane favored by billionaires that bills itself as the fastest plane built in civil aviation . Televangelist: Creflo Dollar is the founder of World Changers Church International, which has about 30,000 members and an 8,500 seater amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome' Among the billionaires who own a Gulfstream G650 are Steve Jobs' wife Lauren Powell Jobs, Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn add Nike co-founder Phil Knight. There is a long waiting list for the aircraft, with the next round of planes not due until 2017. According to the Creflo Dollar Ministry's website: 'The ministry's current airplane, was built in 1984, purchased by the ministry in 1999 and has since logged four million miles. 'Recently on an overseas trip to a global conference, one of the engines failed. Arrested: The Reverend was charged in 2012 for allegedly attacking his teenage daughter . 'By the grace of God, the expert pilot, who's flown with Creflo for almost 20 years, landed the plane safely without injury or harm to any passengers.' The Christian Post first reported that Dollar insisted that he needs the jet to continue sharing the word of Jesus. He preaches all over the world, but primarily works out of a 8,500-seat amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome', satelliting the sermons to churches all over the country. The website pledge continued: 'Believe it or not, there are still millions of people on this planet who have never heard of Jesus Christ and know nothing of His greatness.' 'Our hearts desire to see precious lives changed and snatched out of darkness and thrust into His marvelous light! 'We need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ,"" the appeal continued before asking supporters of the ministry to sow a $300 seed into the airplane fund, billed Project G650.' However, according to Financial Juneteenth, a Report of the Senate Finance Committee, Minority Staff Review of WCCI, found that Dollar's current jet had also been used for a variety of vacation flights, including stops in Las Vegas, Nevada, Miami, Florida and Hawaii, citing Federal Aviation Administration figures. Dollar has refused over the years to disclose his salary, but has an estimated net worth of $27 million. He has five children to his wife, Taffi, who he married in 1985. Couple: Dollar and his wife, Taffi (pictured together) were married in 1985 and have five children . Home: Dollar and his family primarily live in this multi-million dollar in Fayettville, Georgia, south of Atlanta . In June 2012, his 15-year-old daughter called 911, saying her father repeatedly punched and choked her at their Atlanta home. The teenager also said it wasn't the first time something like that had happened and that she felt threatened living in the house. Dollar was arrested and charged with family brutality and juvenile cruelty. The charges were later dropped, but he was required to complete a three-month anger management program. At his next sermon, two days following the arrest, Dollar spent several minutes addressing the incident, starting with: 'I will say this emphatically: I should have never been arrested.' Dollar has strenuously denied the accusations, saying it was a family argument with 'heightened emotions'. Damaged: Dollar says the church's current plane, bought in 1999, is broken and needs to be replaced, or he will be unable to continue working around the world . Dollar's wife Taffi has been known to introduce her husband at his sermons. During her address, she claims Dollar comes 'face to face with God, like Moses'. She also includes an admonition saying that 'every tongue that rises up against' (Dollar) 'will be struck down', Financial Juneteenth reported. The World Changers Church International (WCCI) has about 30,000 constituents.

"A video of a visually-impaired samosa street seller in India refusing a generous gift of money from a  stranger has gone viral. Posted on YouTube by Indian actor Varun Pruthia whose 'Bringing Humanity Back' videos have made him an internet sensation, the clip shows him approaching a man sitting on the ground selling samosas. Priced at just 10 rupees for two samosas, the man is left astonished when Delhi-based Mr Pruthia gives him 1000 rupees, saying: 'God sent this for you' before walking off without waiting for his change. 1000 rupees is around £10, and with more than 40% of Indians earning just 78 pence a day, a one thousand rupee note is the equivalent of two weeks' wages. However, rather than accepting the money, the samosa seller chases after him and insists on giving him his money back. 'Sir, I don't need 1000 rupees,' he says, 'what I make with my efforts is enough for me. 'Give this to someone more needy than me,' insists the street seller to Mr Pruthia who smiles at him in astonishment.

'A big salute to you sir for your honesty,' says the actor, still clearly in shock, '...never give up in life.' Mr Pruthia then asks the man for a hug and as they embrace  the food seller says: 'I just want money for my efforts, here is your change.' Both men smile at each other, salute and part ways. The video then goes black and a message comes on the screen: . 'There are people who have money, and people who are rich.

"A Brazilian teenager died when a game of Russian roulette went badly wrong, the men accused of killing her have claimed. Natalia Jeane Germano, 19, died instantly after being shot in the head whilst at the house of a friend. It has been claimed that Natalia dared one of her pals to pull the trigger when he was pointing a gun at her - and did not realise the chamber was loaded. Killed: Natalia Jeane Germano, 19, died instantly after being shot in the head whilst at the house of a friend in Maringá, Brazil . Dumped: Her friends claim she was killed when a game of Russian roulette went tragically wrong - but her mother Maria says she does not believe their version of events . She was missing for two days before her body was discovered hidden in bushes last Saturday in the city of Maringá in the southern state of Parana. Three men have been arrested and charged with her death, but they have told police it was a tragic accident after a game of Russian roulette went tragically wrong. But her heartbroken mother Maria José Germano told local media she did not believe that her daughter's death was an accident and claimed the house she died in was a drug den. Mrs Germano said her  unemployed daughter had attended a job interview on the morning of the day she disappeared. Two days later, her body was found wrapped in a plastic bag on wasteland in the north of the city and she had a single bullet hole in her head. She said: 'I do not believe this story that she died in this game. The house where she died was a drugs point.' Mrs Germano added: 'She was mouthy and may have made some sort of comment and was killed. 'My daughter was not a drug trafficker and did not use drugs. What she did wrong was get involved with this kind of friendship. 'In addition to killing my daughter, they threw her body in a bush like a dog. This hurt me too much, it will be with me forever.' Popular: Natalia's friends shared pictures and messages of support after she had gone missing last week . Location: The body of Natalia Jeane Germano was found in the city of Maringa in the southern state of Parana in Brazil .

"A high-profile RSPCA prosecution of the renowned Cattistock Hunt in Dorset has spectacularly collapsed amid claims that the hunt was the victim of a politically inspired campaign, funded by a mystery backer. The Cattistock's joint master Will Bryer has accused the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals – which brought the prosecution – of co-ordinating a campaign of harassment and surveillance over more than three years, in a failed attempt to prove the hunt had broken the law. He also claimed a wealthy anti-hunting businessman intent on landing a 'prize scalp' had bankrolled surveillance of him, his employees and hunt followers, saying: 'We believe the campaign is funded by a Dorset-based company. A high-profile RSPCA prosecution of the renowned Cattistock Hunt in Dorset has spectacularly collapsed amid claims that the hunt was the victim of a politically inspired campaign . Hunt saboteurs at our meets this year were all wearing T-shirts advertising the firm. We don't believe that to be a coincidence but a statement.' The animal rights organisation, which has been criticised for spending £22.5 million pursuing animal welfare prosecutions last year, formally withdrew its case on Friday – after admitting it had no realistic chance of a conviction. Mr Bryer, whose joint master of the Cattistock is one of the richest women in Britain, the Honourable Mrs Charlotte Townshend, claimed the campaign had been 'focused and sophisticated'. He went on to say: 'Despite the endless footage taken of us by so-called covert investigators, this is the only time anyone associated with the Cattistock has ever faced a charge and now it has been dropped. Cattistock's joint master Will Bryer (pictured) claimed a wealthy anti-hunting businessman intent on landing a 'prize scalp' had bankrolled surveillance of him . 'I'm afraid the time has long passed when we thought these people were seriously interested in the law. As far as we are concerned, this is just another way of attacking people who participate in hunting.' Yesterday, the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance said the RSPCA was at a crossroads, and would have to decide whether to continue to bring what it described as 'malicious' cases or 'embrace sanity and change tactics'. Mr Bryer's solicitor, Jamie Foster, claimed that the case had been flawed from the start. He explained: 'There is video footage of my client laying legal trails before and after the alleged breach of the hunting ban which was not disclosed to us by the RSPCA.' He said the laying of a trail, or a scent which the hounds can track rather than chasing a live animal, showed that the Cattistock had behaved responsibly, not recklessly as the prosecution claimed. Cattistock chairman Robert Atkinson said: 'We are very pleased that common sense has prevailed and the case has been dropped. The hunt and all its staff, in particular Will as master, make every effort to hunt within the law and be seen to do so. We are glad that our stance has been so demonstrably and categorically vindicated by the court.' The RSPCA has the power to bring its own prosecutions rather than rely on the police or the Crown Prosecution Service. However last October, a report commissioned by the charity recommended abandoning the policy and leaving the job to the CPS, which has more expertise. An animal rights organisation formally withdrew its case against the hunt (pcitured) on Friday – after admitting it had no realistic chance of a conviction . Last year, The Mail on Sunday reported that the RSPCA had spent £22.5 million on prosecutions in two years, and had been obliged to take out an overdraft facility with its bank, Coutts, for the first time in its 190-year history. Discussing the dropped prosecution yesterday, an RSPCA spokesman said: 'We have not at any stage been made aware of a trail being laid or of any alleged footage of such a trail being laid. But having considered all the evidence now available, we concluded there no longer remains a realistic prospect of securing a conviction.' Addressing the Cattistock's claim that the RSPCA had mounted a campaign of surveillance, he said: 'This is an outrageous slur and completely untrue. We did not monitor this hunt. The RSPCA does not monitor any hunts.' He went on to reject the claim that the prosecution had been effectively paid for by a wealthy backer, insisting: 'This prosecution was funded by the RSPCA.' Philip Mansbridge, the UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare – which shot the disputed footage and provided it to the RSPCA – said: 'We are very disappointed that the case has been dropped. We do understand the reasons and the difficulties in getting these cases through the courts. But we stand by our evidence completely; this case was dropped, not lost.' He went on to say: 'We have now reached the reluctant conclusion that having tried everything under the current judicial system, we now need to make changes to strengthen the Hunting Act. Time and time again, hunts flout the law and escape prosecution by using the false alibi that they were trail hunting. The pro-hunt lobby continually drag out cases and waste public and charity funds.'

"There are many ways to be labelled 'A bad girl' in the UK, including stealing from the tuck-shop, cheating in an exam and smoking behind the bike sheds. But in India, the bar for being a disappointment to society is much, much lower. A group of students from the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology in Bangalore made a tongue-in-cheek poster detailing the qualities a young women needs in India to be considered 'bad'. The poster by students at the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology in Bangalore details things that a bad girl does in India . The project came about after the pupils were given an assignment to contrast different images from popular culture. They decided to base a poster on an Indian old print from the 1980's that listed the good things an 'Ideal Boy' does, including 'greeting your parents', 'eat meals on time' and 'get up early'. In contrast, the new poster made by the students shows that a bad girl 'can't make round rotis', 'has breasts', and 'falls in love in a park.' The group also made a poster that lists things that bad girls own, including a pregnancy test, condoms and cigarettes, but some of the items are far more innocent, including an iPhone, lipstick, and a short skirt. They also created a posted that detailed the items a bad girl owns . The assignment was given by teacher Alison Byres, who told the Wall Street Journal that her her students regularly bring up the topic of a 'Bad Girl' in her classes nowadays. She said: 'It seems like there’s nothing you can do to be the perfect girl because being a girl itself appears to be the problem.' The poster was based on a 1980s poster that detailed everything an ideal boy does . Student Furqan Jawed, who originally posted the image to Facebook said he was shocked by the attention it has received so far. He told BBC Trending: 'We did not mean it to become social propaganda. 'It was done as part of an assignment.' The poster comes just a few weeks after a woman who uploaded a brutally honest 'Marriage CV' to the internet after discovering her parents had posted a profile of their daughter on a dating site. Indhuja Pillai, 23, from Bangalore, couldn't believe her eyes when she saw the account that her well-meaning parents had created in order to find her a husband. She decided to build her own description, with a no-holds-barred description of her likes, dislikes and general demeanor and posted it on a blogging site. The profile reads: 'I wear glasses and look dorky in them. Not a spendthrift or a shopaholic. 'Detest masala & drama, not a TV fan. I don't read. 'NOT a womanly woman.

"Tragedy: Ian Anderson says he watched as police shot his service dog Burberry . A man lost his best friend on Sunday after he says a police officer shot and killed his beloved service dog Burberry while responding to a call in the neighborhood. Ian Anderson of San Diego says he's absolutely heartbroken after being forced to watch police shoot his 6-year-old pit bull Burberry over the weekend. He says it's all because the dog was spooked and was barking. NBC reports that officers were called just before 5:30 a.m. on Sunday for a domestic disturbance call in Anderson's neighborhood. When police arrived they were confronted by the 50 to 60 pound dog Burberry  and one of the officers fired his gun. Anderson claims that Burberry started barking when police knocked on his door and that they even had the wrong address for the domestic dispute call. He says that no arrests were made that night. Anderson says one officer petted the pit bull but that the other officer reacted with fear at seeing the dog and hearing him bark. 'The other officer yelled and screamed at the dog for no reason to get inside. It startled the dog,' Anderson said. '[The officer] jumped back, went this way, drew his weapon,' he said. 'Boom.

"Melissa Brittle, 38, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for failing to report the abuse of her grandson . A Maryland woman who stood by while her husband horrifically whipped, shook and kicked his grandson to death has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors say Melissa Dawn Brittle, 38, of Thurmont, Maryland, encouraged husband Raymond Brittle to punish two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins - who was staying with the Brittles and their three children at the time. Robert died in a Washington, DC, hospital on September 8, 2013 following injuries that State's Attorney Charlie Smith called the most horrific he has ever seen, according to the Frederick News-Post. Mrs Brittle waited until the next day to take the unconscious boy to the hospital. She told police that Robert had fallen down the stairs. Mrs Brittle's lawyer argued that she was terrified of her emotionally abusive husband and intimidated into covering up his violence against little Robert. Defense attorney Mary Drawbaugh told Daily Mail Online that Brittle had no job, no high school diploma and no driver's license. 'We adamantly denied that she encouraged the child in any way,' Mrs Drawbaugh said. Raymond Brittle has admitted to horrifically beating two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins to death in September 2013. The Brittles were looking after the boy for his mother . 'She did come clean and cooperated with police and did facilitate a call to her husband in which he confessed to the crime.' Drawbaugh asked for a 12-year sentence, the lowest end of the sentencing spectrum for the case, arguing that Mrs Brittle helped bring about her husband's guilty plea and had been prepared to testify against him. Mrs Brittle faced up to 40 years in prison under a state law that says failing to report child abuse also constitutes child abuse. A judge on Wednesday ordered her held for 20 years, with 20 years suspended. Robert Dean Watkins was the step-grandson of Raymond Brittle. Raymond and Melissa has agreed to take care of the child for his mother . Raymond Brittle has also pleaded guilty in the child abuse case and faces 55 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week. Prosecutors say he routinely beat and battered Robert while he was caring for his grandchild. On September 5, he became enraged at the boy when he wouldn't eat dinner. He whipped the children with a belt and kicked him. Investigators say he also lifted the boy by his head and shook him. An autopsy found that most of the boy's body was covered with bruises. He also had a fracture that covered three quarter of his skull and the injuries caused his brain to shift.","Melissa Brittle was sentenced under Maryland law that says failing to report child abuse also constitutes child abuse .

"For most of her life young Queensland woman Samantha Geldenhuys thought she was an ordinary Australian girl with a loving mum and younger brother living in a beachside suburb of Townsville. Then the Australian Federal Police came knocking on the door of the family home and arrested Sam's mother. That was when the pretty young blonde learned she was the subject of one of America’s longest running child kidnapping cases, and that her mother's real name was Dorothy Barnett and that she was an international fugitive wanted by US federal authorities. And that over in South Carolina a wealthy stockbroker by the name of Benjamin Harris Todd III had never given up hope of finding her - and that Sam's birth name was Savanna Todd. 'She just took me and ran,' Sam told Channel Seven. 'She started anew just for me.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Confused: For 20 years Samantha Geldenhuys (pictured) thought she was an ordinary young woman, but then police came and arrested her mother at their Townsville home and Sam learned she was the centre of America’s longest running child kidnapping case and her Mum was an international fugitive . Never gave up hope: Savanna's father Benjamin Todd II (pictured with his baby daughter in 1994) never stopped hoping his kidnapped daughter would be found and each year updated her room and made a video for each of her birthdays . Dorothy Lee Barnett pictured with baby Savanna kidnapped her daughter after a bitter custody battle and absconded to South Africa and eventually Australia where she lived as a fugitive under an assumed name until her lie unravelled following a slip of the tongue while drinking with friends . The only father she knew: Savanna, pictured as a toddler, was renamed Samantha. She is in the arms of the man she thought was her father, her stepfather, Juan Geldenhuys, who later died before Samantha learned the incredible truth about her past . Another life: Samantha pictured with the mother she knew as Alex Geldenhuys, whose real name was revealed as Dorothy Barnett following her dramatic arrest in Queensland last year and deportation back to a US Jail . It was a lot to take in the blur that followed. Sam's mother made several appearances during extradition hearings in a Queensland court before Ms Barnett was finally deported to the US and immediately placed in prison. Channel Seven's Sunday Night programme accompanied Ms Geldenhuys to the US for a tearful reunion with her mother and to attend 53-year-old Ms Barnett's trial on Parental Kidnapping and US Passport Fraud charges, for which she is now serving prison time. The dramatic events of Sam's past began on an access visit in 1994, when Dorothy Barnett did not return baby Savanna to Benjamin Todd and the two disappeared. Samantha and her real father Benjamin Todd III pictured together just months before Savanna disappeared. Following her parents' separation her father was awarded full custody of Savanna . A still from footage of baby Savanna before her kidnapping by her mother, who was only allowed supervised acess to her daughter after a court case in which Benjamin Todd III alleged Barnett was bipolar . Samantha and her mother not long after fleeing. Todd and Barnett had been engaged in a bitter custody battle, but each side has different reasons for the failure of their doomed relationship . Savanna now named Samantha with stepfather Juan and mother Dorothy, now known as Alex, in South Africa . A young Samantha who insists she had a loving, stable upbringing and that her mother was nothing but loving, doting on herself and her younger half-brother, who's father is Samantha's late stepfather Juan . Samantha last year after learning the truth about her past . Todd and Barnett had been engaged in a bitter custody battle, but each side has different reasons for the failure of their doomed relationship. Benjamin Todd II was a softly spoken 'southern gentleman' and classical music lover, the son of a nurse and a doctor from Kentucky who entered a career working at financial management company Merrill Lynch in Charleston, South Carolina. Dorothy Lee Barnett, had been raised by a single mother and stepfather on welfare, and had travelled extensively, running a piggery in Belize, a jewellery business in Africa, before finally settling for a job as a flight attendant. Savanna Todd as a baby with her mother Dorothy before Ms Barnett fled overseas and began living life under the radar until her arrest in Townsville last year . Loving relationship: Barnett and 11-month-old Savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives, travelling to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa where Barnett married Juan Geldenhuys and had a son . When the pair met, and married after a whirlwind romance, Dorothy became pregnant with her daughter. Dorothy Barnett's friends told the Seven Network that Benjamin Todd had wanted Barnett to terminate her pregnancy with Savanna in 1993. But when the marriage failed, it was Todd who gained custody of Savanna following a court case in which he alleged Barnett was bipolar, and she was awarded only supervised access to her baby daughter. It was on one of these visits Barnett and 11-month-old Savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives, travelling to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa where Barnett married Juan Geldenhuys and they had a son. Mr Todd's lawyer, J Graham Sturgis told Channel Seven, Benjamin Todd 'never quit' looking for his daughter. 'For years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her on her birthdays,' Mr Sturgis said . Nervous: Benjamind Todd II (left on television during the years he searched for his daughter) and (right) last year after learning his 20 year wait had come to an end, but at a time when he was still unsure whether Savanna/Samantha would want to meet him . The couple emigrated to New Zealand, where they gained citizenship, and then Barnett and her children moved to Australia's Sunshine Coast, where they were known as Alexandria, Samantha and Rhys Geldenhuys. It was over evening drinks after a day's sailing in 2011 that 'Alex Geldenhuys' slipped up. Ms Barnett referred to Samantha as 'Savanna' and said she had fled an 'abusive' relationship in America. Barnett's South African friends went online and found a page on the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children's website. They saw pictures of a woman who looked like a younger 'Alex' and an age-advanced photo of a girl who resembled Samantha. They contacted Benjamin Todd III  in America. His long hunt for Savanna was over. Tearful reunion: Samantha speaks on a phone to her mother inside the South Carolina prison where Dorothy Barnett is serving time for her kidnap and passport fraud offences . Dorothy Barnett cries as she speaks with her daughter in the prison where she is serving 21 months after being deported and pleading guilty to kidnapping her own child from the US in 1994 . As Mr Todd's lawyer, J Graham Sturgis told Channel Seven, Benjamin Todd 'never quit' looking for his daughter. 'For years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her on her birthdays,' Mr Sturgis said. 'It is a parent's worst nightmare not to know what happened to a child [but] he never lost hope and pursued every possibility that might lead to her recovery.' However, friends of Ms Barnett described Todd as an 'evil, evil man' while Barnett herself described his pursuit of her as 'corrupt' and 'criminal'. Whatever is the truth, the extraordinary story of how Ms Barnett eluded the FBI for two decades, and how her life as a lie unravelled, is said to have 'deeply confused' 21-year-old Samantha. Channel Seven filmed her as she reunited with Ms Barnett in the South Carolina prison where she is serving a 21 month sentence after pleading guilty to one count of International Parental Kidnapping and two counts of False Statement in a Passport Application. Ms Barnett will be required to undergo two years’ supervised parole following her release. While Channel Seven has not yet revealed whether Samantha finally meets her real father, there has been emotions running high on both sides. 'His daughter thus far has been reluctant to meet,' J Graham Sturgis, told Daily Mail Australia. 'She only knows her mother and the misinformation that has been provided her. She likely would be considered by her mother to be disloyal if she were to meet [Todd] at this time.' Mr Sturgis said the intensely private stockbroker understood why the daughter snatched from him and who never knew him as father had  held off from speaking with him, and that he feared jeopardising his hoped-for reunion with her. But Mr Sturgis said Todd yearned for the 'long awaited opportunity' of meeting Savanna and had literally counted the days - 19 years, six months and 12 days - from the access visit on which Savanna disappeared  to when Australian police knocked on a door in faraway Townsville and his long lost daughter was found.

"A young woman who vanished as a teenager may have been found hundreds of miles from home. Ashley Summers of Cleveland, Ohio is believed to have been spotted in video footage taken from a bank ATM in Warwick, Rhode Island this January, eight years after the 14-year-old first was reported as missing. This as the FBI has revealed she may be wanted in connection with check theft and identity fraud in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Scroll down for video . Ashley Summers may have been spotted in Rhode Island (above) eight years after she disappeared from Cleveland, Ohio at the age of 14 . Summers is seen at 14-years-old (left) and in an age progression photo at 20-years-old (right) This is the car the woman believed to be Summers was spotted in at a bank in Rhode Island . NBC News reports that Summers' step-grandmother Linda stumbled across the photo when the FBI posted it online looking for information about the woman, at which point she immediately sent photos of Summers to the Warwick Police Department as they searched for leads in locating the woman. When that did not work, the FBI stepped in to launch a wider search, even posting billboards along the East Coast. Despite the young woman's possible criminal activity, this would be amazing news for the family as some believed Summers may have been a victim of Ariel Castro, the Cleveland kidnapper who held three woman against their will in his House of Horrors for years. Michelle Knight, one of the victims, said upon her release that she remembered another girl being at the house at some point around the time Summers first disappeared on July 6, 2007. Knight said the victim disappeared shortly after. Authorities immediately believed the girl could have been Summers as she lived in the same neighborhood as Castro. It was thought by some that she may have been kidnapped by Ariel Castro and kept at his House of Horrors (above), which was in her Cleveland neighborhood . Summers' mother, Jennifer, has always been firm in her belief that her daughter was taken against her will and would never have run off from home on her own. Summers was living with an uncle at the time of his disappearance, arguing with the man shortly before she vanished. She may have called her mother a year later, who claims she received a call from a woman who said; 'It's me mom. Dont worry.' And as the FBI calls on the public to help locate this woman, Summers' mother is hoping she will finally be able to see her daughter again after all these years and 'erase the pain' she has felt since that day in 2007. 'There's nothing that tells us that it is her, but there's nothing telling us that it's not her either,' said FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson. Anyone with any information is asked to call 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).","Ashley Summers may have been spotted in Rhode Island eight years after she disappeared from Cleveland, Ohio at the age of 14 .

"This is the touching moment a Kentucky police officer grabbed the hand of a woman who was struggling during a 10k race and helped her cross the finish line. Asia Ford was celebrating her 200lb weight loss by participating in the Rodes City Run in Louisville. But after hitting the fourth mile, she became dizzy and found it hard to breathe. Ford wrote on her Facebook that she had forgotten to eat that morning and was still recovering from a bout of pneumonia. But when paramedics checked on the mother-of-three she said there was no way she was going to quit. Her motivation inspired Lt Aubrey Gregory, who was working the race nearby. Scroll down for video . Asia Ford was struggling after the fourth mile of the Rodes City Run in Louisville, Kentucky but refused to stop. Lt Aubrey Gregory was inspired by her motivation and decided he had to make sure she finished . He said he had to 'meet this inspirational woman' and got out and grabbed her hand. Gregory shared stories of his late mother to keep Ford's mind off the pain as they walked the last two miles with her son to the finish line . Gregory, who works with the Louisville Metro Police Department, decided he was going to make sure Ford crossed that finish line. 'I said I'm not going to let her stop, we're going to do this together,' he told WAVE 3. 'So I got out and I grabbed her hand.I had to meet this inspirational woman.' Gregory kept Ford's mind off the pain for the final two miles and shared stories about his late mother, who had diabetes. And although Ford was long behind the rest of the pack and last in the race, Gregory called ahead to make sure there would be a finish line  waiting for them, he told Fox News. Soon the pair, who were joined by Ford's son Terrance, heard the crowd cheer. Gregory said it gave him goosebumps. 'I let her go right there before the end,' he told WHAS 11. 'To see her raise her hands, there aren't words to express the way I felt seeing her be successful.' Ford shared photos of her incredible weight loss journey where, at her heaviest, she weighed 474 pounds. Ford decided to get healthy so that she could be there for her three children . Ford told WAVE 3 Gregory was her 'angel', who came at the moment she 'really needed him'. She added that he was an 'inspiration' for not letting her give up when she felt she couldn't continue. Terrance Ford said that he was glad to see there were police officers like Gregory still around. 'With all the stuff that's going on with police, it's just nice to know there are nice people out there,' he said. But it's his mother who Terrance said inspires  and motivates him to 'push harder' to do what he wants in life. At her heaviest, Ford weighed 474 pounds. She had struggled with her weight for years but, when her then-husband lost a limb from diabetes, Ford knew she had to make a change for her children. 'That is when I woke up,' she told WHAS 11. 'I couldn't allow them to be on this earth without my help.' 'And the only way I would be able to help them is if I helped myself first.' WAVE 3 .

"A man has admitted killing the businessman cousin of Sir Ranulph Fiennes by stabbing him three times with a pair of scissors at a tapas bar. Nicholas Hunter was heard saying, 'The world is going to end tonight at midnight,' before he launched a random attack on James Fiennes. He  pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after psychiatrists agreed he was mentally ill at the time of the attack in April last year, and was sentenced to be detained indefinitely. Attack: James Fiennes, left, was killed in a bar by mentally ill stranger Nicholas Hunter, right . Mr Fiennes, 49, was an IT consultant and entrepreneur who was the second cousin of explorer Sir Ranulph and a distant relative of actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes. The Old Bailey heard that on the evening of his death he had gone for a drink at The Tapestry tapas bar in Mortlake, south-west London, near the flat where he spent half of each week. He was a regular at the bar, and was described by staff and customers as a 'quiet, polite, kind and generous man', said prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC. She told the court that Hunter, 37, was working for an engineering company in Barnes run by his friend Thomas Olsen. His family have a 'genetic vulnerability' to mental illness and his maternal grandfather, his nephew and his brother have all been affected, Ms Johnson said. Killing: The attack took place at The Tapestry tapas bar in Mortlake, south London in April 2014 . Investigation: A police officer outside the bar shortly after the tragic incident last year . In 2005 he moved with his wife to Hong Kong to work for Cathay Pacific, but in 2011 he resigned and returned to Britain after being diagnosed with depression and prescribed anti-psychotic drugs. After his baby son was born in February 2014 Hunter reported feeling paranoid, suspicious and losing touch with reality, said Ms Johnson. 'He believed people were talking about him, following him and were going to kill him,' she added. On the day of the attack, Hunter bought a a pair of scissors from Sainsbury's during his lunch break and after work he went to Mr Olsen's home and suggested going for a drink. Shortly after he arrived at the bar he announced 'out of the blue' to Mr Olsen, 'I'm going to have a sex change', then added: 'I shouldn't have told you that, I'm going to kill you, the world is going to end at midnight tonight.' Hunter then appeared to notice Mr Fiennes and called out 'Hi James', even though he had not met the victim previously. Mr Fiennes approached him and asked how they knew each other, but Hunter just said: 'James, I'm going to have to kill you.' The attacker pulled out his scissors and stabbed Mr Fiennes repeatedly in a 'frenzied and unprovoked' attack, the court heard, before guests tackled him to the ground. Mr Olsen said the 'vicious' attack made it look 'as if he was possessed', the court was told. Relatives: Mr Fiennes was a distant cousin of explorer Ranulph Fiennes, left, and actor Ralph Fiennes, right . Mr Fiennes was rushed to hospital for emergency treatment but died five hours later after his wife Caroline and their two children rushed to London from the family home in Sherborne, Dorset. Hunter, originally from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, said 'I have really f***ed up my life' after dropping the scissors in the bar. He later told investigators he did not know why he had killed Mr Fiennes, but said it had something to do with the end of the world. The killer was also unable to explain why he had greeted his victim by name, saying he had 'a complete explosion in his mind'. Hunter pleaded not guilty to murdering and threatening to kill Mr Olsen, but the Crown agreed to let the charges lie on file after he admitted manslaughter. Miss Johnson said: 'The psychiatrists are agreed that at the time the defendant was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning, namely schizo-affective disorder.' In a victim impact statement, Mrs Fiennes said: 'The day I met James I knew I would marry him. I loved him then, I love him now and I will love him forever. 'He was my best friend, my soulmate, my rock or oak tree. Everything a good husband could be, James was. 'He was kind, considerate, funny, gentle, spiritual and intelligent. Above all he was loving. Everyone and anyone who knew James described him as a gentleman in every sense of the world.' In a statement read out by his barrister Isabella Forshall QC, Hunter said: 'Words alone cannot express the sorrow I feel for the catastrophic situation I have caused to those affected. I think of them and I pray for them. 'I am so very sorry for the tragedy my actions have caused.' Miss Forshall said: 'If this man hadn't become mentally ill he would have continued to live a conscientious, thoughtful and valuable life.' Sentencing Hunter to be detained indefinitely in a secure hospital, judge Gerald Gordon said: 'After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that your responsibility for what you did at the time by reason of your mental illness was so substantially reduced and caused by your mental health that that is the right course. 'I should stress that I have taken into account both the ferocity of the attack and that the person you attacked was a total stranger. 'This was indeed a serious, unprovoked attack upon a complete stranger resulting in his loss of life. It occurred without your having any violent history whatsoever and as a result of your mental illness. 'I am satisfied that in the circumstances that if you are ever released, unless it is with the most careful control and monitoring, that there is a real risk of serious harm were there to be any future relapse.'","James Fiennes, 49, was killed in a tapas bar by stranger Nicholas Hunter .

"A 19-year-old biracial man who was unarmed when killed by a white Madison police officer was shot in his head, right arm and torso, according to preliminary autopsy reports released Friday. The reports from the Dane County Medical Examiner don't say how many times Tony Robinson was shot on March 6, or whether he was shot while facing or turned away from the officer, but they determined he died from 'firearm related trauma.' The medical examiner didn't say when a final report would be released, but said the results of toxicology tests aren't expected for several more weeks. Madison police officer Matty Kenny fatally shot teen Tony Robinson (right) in the head, right arm, and torso according to a preliminary autopsy report . Robinson was fatally shot by police officer Matt Kenny after the officer was summoned to a call that the young man was jumping in and out of traffic and had assaulted someone. Authorities said the officer heard a disturbance and forced his way into an apartment where Robinson had gone, and fired after Robinson assaulted him. There have been numerous peaceful protests since the shooting, often drawing about 1,000 people. Community leaders working to address racial disparities said they hope Robinson's death draws more eyes to inequalities in the state's capital city, where black residents make up less than 10 percent of the population but account for a disproportionate share of arrests, incarcerations and children in poverty. Police originally described Robinson as black, but family members have said he embraced a biracial identity from having a white mother and black father. Wisconsin Attorney Gen. Brad Schimel has declined to release details about the shooting, claiming such information has resulted in turmoil in similar racially charged situations over the last year . Messages left with a family spokesman and community members weren't immediately returned Friday. Attorney General Brad Schimel has declined to go into any details about the shooting, saying releasing information in bits has caused turmoil in other racially charged officer-involved shootings in the U.S. over the last year. The Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating the incident under a state law that requires an outside agency to look into any fatal police shootings. Schimel has said he hopes to have the bulk of that investigation done and submitted to the local district attorney in two weeks. Curtis Sails with the Coalition for Justice hands out ""Justice for Tony"" signs in Worthington Park before a protest in Madison . Christen Justice, left, and other protesters march west on Commercial Avenue during a protest against the police killing of Tony Robinson . Division Administrator Dave Matthews asked people to be patient, stressing that the investigation is massive. Authorities have said they're looking at what every witness was doing in the hours leading up the shooting. Kenny wasn't wearing a body camera, but agents are examining video recordings from squad cars that arrived after the shooting and from devices people were carrying, he said. Matthews called the time it will take to review all the recordings 'daunting.' A memorial for Robinson with flowers and written messages has been set up at the shooting scene. Robinson's funeral is scheduled for Saturday.","Report from the Dane County Medical Examiner don't say how many times Robinson was shot by officer Matt Kenny on March 6 .

"A coalition government made up of Labour and the Scottish National Party could break up the UK, Sir John Major warned last night. With the result of May’s general election looking very close, the former Conservative prime minister said that a Labour-SNP coalition would be a ‘lethal cocktail’ and ‘a tragedy in the making’. Polls suggest that, with no party likely to win enough seats to govern alone, a Labour-SNP coalition is a likely outcome from the election.

Sir John, who was Prime Minister between 1990 to 1997, last night urged Ed Miliband to ‘summon the courage’ to formally rule out any deal. The Labour leader, who has so far failed to do so, is due to address Scottish Labour’s spring conference this weekend. Sir John said: ‘The SNP would enter into any agreement with Labour with one overriding aim: To break up the United Kingdom. It is shameful that Labour have not already ruled out even the suggestion. ‘They would be relying on support from a party that will use every strategy it can to break free from the UK. ‘Labour now have to make a choice,’ he wrote in today’s Daily Telegraph. ‘They must summon the courage of their convictions and declare their intent. ‘The British people – north and south of the border – do not deserve to be misled. ‘If the outcome of the General Election is inconclusive, will they refuse to govern with the support of a party whose principal aim is to break up the United Kingdom?’ Sir John, who was Prime Minister between 1990 to 1997, last night urged Ed Miliband (pictured) to ‘summon the courage’ to formally rule out any deal . As prime minister, Sir John warned that devolution could lead to Scotland’s independence. He said he was now speaking out as ‘an Englishman with a profound admiration and respect for Scotland’. ‘At Westminster, SNP minds would not be focused on the well-being of the United Kingdom, but on their own party interests,’ he added. ‘In collaboration, the two parties would make common cause at the expense of their natural enemies. For Labour, that will be to pick the pockets of the Tory shires; and for the SNP, to boost Scotland at the expense of the rest of the UK.’ Ed Miliband is facing increasing demands from senior Labour figures to rule out a power-sharing deal with the SNP. Senior MPs are demanding the Labour leader uses a keynote speech at the Scottish Labour conference in Edinburgh tomorrow to make his position clear. Mr Miliband is said to be ‘waiting for the right moment’ to rule out a deal. But there is concern that he may only be prepared to rule out a formal coalition – leaving open the possibility of the SNP propping up a Labour-led government in key votes in exchange for concessions to Scotland. David Cameron has branded an electoral pact between Labour and SNP ‘the ultimate nightmare’.","John Major warns coalition between Labour and SNP could break up UK .

"Dozens of cheap and popular California wines are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic, claims a new lawsuit filed this week. Sutter Home, Korbel, Franzia and Trader Joe's Charles Shaw White Zifandel, also known as 'Two-Buck Chuck,' were just a few of the 31 wine brands the lawsuit claimed were unsafe. Twenty-eight California wineries were listed in the complaint, which is asking for a halt in production of the wines in question. Scroll down for video . A new lawsuit claims dozens of cheap and popular California Wine, including Franzia and Trader Joe's Charles Shaw White Zifandel, are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic . The lawsuit was filed by four individual Southern California wine consumers who, according to their attorney Brian Kabateck, had 1,306 wines tested at a Denver-based laboratory and then confirmed results with two additional laboratories. Kabateck said 83 wines, almost all of which sell for below $10 a bottle, contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water. The Environmental Protection Agency standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion - meaning that the tests allegedly found arsenic levels that were double the federal drinking water standard. 'This is a very serious public health concern,' Kabateck said. 'We would hope the wine industry would take these wines off the shelf immediately.' 'If not voluntarily, we would ask the court to do it.' The United States does not have a set standard for safe levels of arsenic in wine, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The lawsuit claims 83 of the 1,306 wines that were tested contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water . But wines are allowed to have arsenic levels up to 100 parts per billion in Canada - and other countries allow even higher levels. The Wine Institute, an advocacy group for California wineries, called the lawsuit 'misleading' and 'false'. According to Institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi, California wines have never come close to exceeding the arsenic levels that are accepted in other countries, she told the Associated Press. In a release statement, the Institute said arsenic was 'prevalent in the natural environment' and that 'no research' had found the amounts in wine to 'pose a health risk to consumers'. The lawsuit specifies the wines contained 'inorganic arsenic,' which is more toxic than the arsenic found naturally in the environment. Chronic long-term consumption of inorganic arsenic can cause cancer, as well as liver and kidney damage. But a number of wine producers have fought back at the lawsuit and said they plan to contest the claims. A Trader Joe's spokesman said the grocery store chain had 'no reason to believe the wines we offer are unsafe, including Charles Shaw White Zinfandel'. Korbel said the lawsuit was 'without merit,' adding that the company plans to challenge the allegations. The 83 bottles of wine cited in a lawsuit this week as having dangerously high levels of arsenic came from 28 California wineries and were bottled under 31 different brand labels. Some of the labels included several different types of wine.

"Two men suspected of involvement in the murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov have been arrested by the FSB secret service, it was announced today. The announcement came a week after the 55-year-old foe of Vladimir Putin was gunned down on a bridge close to the Kremlin, where he was walking with his 23-year-old girlfriend, Ukrainian model Anna Duritskaya. FSB head Alexander Bortnikov said in a televised statement: 'As a result of the work done, we have detained today two people suspected of committing this crime - those are Anzor Gubashev and Zaur Dadayev. Scroll down for video . Nemtsov (left) and his 23-year-old model girlfriend, Anna Duritskaya (right) were walking through Moscow when he was shot four times . 'We have reported it to the president.' He stressed the Lubyanka was continuing 'necessary operative and investigative work' on the case. Bortnikov did not immediately give details of their suspected role in the brutal killing, but TASS news agency claimed both were 'suspected of murdering Boris Nemtsov'. Nemtsov was killed as he was preparing a report alleging the Kremlin was deeply involved in the bloody war in eastern Ukraine. Fellow opposition leaders have vowed to ensure his report is published. The two men held by the FSB are understood to be from the Caucasus region in southern Russia. They were evidently detained from evidence found in the getaway car, and through surveillance of telephone calls. But the investigation is still seeking those who ordered the politician's killing. Earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin called for an end to the 'shame' of political killings which have plagued the Kremlin in recent years . The Kremlin has denied any involvement, saying that the killing was a 'provocation' designed to discredit Putin and strengthen his opponents. He was the most prominent opposition figure to be killed in Russia during Putin's 15-year rule. News of the arrest comes as president Vladimir Putin earlier this week demanded an end to 'shameful' political assassinations in the wake of the shooting. But Nemtsov's friends say the Kremlin is to blame for fomenting an atmosphere of hatred towards its opponents. In a speech with officials from the interior ministry, Putin said: 'The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext. 'Russia should be devoid at last of the kind of shame and tragedies that we have recently endured and seen. Nemtsov's mother Dina Eidman, his secretary Inna Krolyova and daughter Dina (from left to right) pay their last respects at a ceremony for Nemtsov . The body of Boris Nemtsov lies in a body bag in central Moscow in the hours after he was gunned down . Emergency services clear the politician's body from the scene where he was killed on February 28 . 'I mean the murder, the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov right in the centre of the capital.' Law enforcement officials have said one lead they were exploring was that the killing was linked to Nemtsov's personal life or business dealings. Earlier on Wednesday, the director of Russia's Federal Security Service said that an investigation had identified several suspects, without giving details. Thousands of Russians yesterday paid their final respects to Nemtsov when he was laid to rest in the capital. The politician's mother Dina, 87, and four children laid him to rest, with ex-UK prime minister Sir John Major leading Western mourners attending his funeral.","Russian security service has arrested two suspects in political shooting .

"Police officers in Alaska's biggest city were pressed into service as cowboys, rounding up a couple of miniature horses that escaped from their corral. Worried residents had begun calling in after seeing the fairy tale-like animals on the loose during the beginning of their morning commute. The two little horses, one black and one tan, were found grazing on the sparse grass in the median of a busy four-lane East Anchorage street about 5.30am Friday. The Anchorage Police Department 'were able to take these horses into custody' after they were found after 5.30 calls to the police . A photo tweeted from the Anchorage police department showed three officers with the two horses they apprehended. The tweet read, 'Some interesting runaways patrol came across this morning!' Police spokeswoman Jennifer Castro tells Anchorage television station KTUU that officers 'were able to take these horses into custody.' The horses were reunited with their owners after escaping from their corral and wandering a few blocks. Castro said, 'You can call it our runaway juveniles for the day.' No citations were issued, according to KTVA. It is not the first time Anchorage police have wrangled horses, but is thought to be the first time they have corralled miniature horses.

"Real estate heir Robert Durst (pictured during a court appearance in August) was charged on Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder . Robert Durst's mumblings about how he 'killed them all' provided the dramatic kick to a documentary about the millionaire's troubled life and connection to three slayings, but it was words he penned that helped lead to his arrest on a murder charge, a law enforcement official said. Analysis linking a letter Durst wrote to his friend Susan Berman a year before her death with one he said 'only the killer could have written' to point police to her body was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation, a police source said. Durst, 71, was charged on Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster, back in 2000. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. He waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him late on Monday with being a felon in possession of a gun because he had a revolver when he was arrested there Saturday. He was also found in possession of a small amount of marijuana. Prosecutors believed that Durst was a flight risk after the revelations of the documentary and may have been planning to head for Cuba. He was found with fake IDs in his hotel room. However one of his lawyers, Chip Lewis, told The LA Times that his client had left his Houston home for New Orleans to escape the media and that he had called daily to check in with him, asking for him by name. It was not clear how soon Durst would be returned to California. Attorney Dick DeGuerin said outside court that Durst didn't kill Berman, and is 'ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial'. Presented with the two letters in the finale of The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst that aired Sunday on HBO, the eccentric heir blinked, burped oddly, pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer. Then he stepped away from the tense interview and went to the bathroom, still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next. 'There it is. You're caught!' Durst whispered before the sound of running water is heard. 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' That moment didn't just make for a captivating ending to the documentary on the eccentric life of an heir to a New York real estate fortune, it could also provide additional evidence for prosecutors. The official said the bathroom recording was not presented to prosecutors before charges were filed because detectives were still trying to determine if the recording was tampered with in any way. But legal experts said the audio and other parts of the interview could become key evidence. Durst and documentary producer Andrew Jarecki (right) examine handwriting examples  from two letters. Analysis linking a letter Durst wrote to Susan Berman a year before her death with one he said 'only the killer could have written' to point police to her body was new evidence in the investigation, a police source said . Robert Durst, far right, was escorted into Orleans Parish Criminal District Court through a tunnel entrance, in New Orleans on Monday for a court hearing to extradite him to Los Angeles to face a murder charge . 'Any statement that the defendant makes that they want to use against him, they can use against him,' said Andrea Roth, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. 'Even if it's sketchy, and only in context appears to make him look guilty.' Kerry Lawrence, a defense attorney in Westchester County, New York, said Durst's lawyers will have to try to explain away his comments, perhaps dismissing them as a joke. 'Prosecutors would argue it was a candid moment of self-reflection, and I assume will argue that he knew he was still being recorded, and this was either said in jest or he was being facetious or sarcastic or was being provocative,' Lawrence said. 'I don't think it's quite the smoking gun.' Durst — still worth millions despite his estrangement from his family, whose New York real estate empire is worth about $4 billion — has maintained his innocence in three killings in as many states. When Durst approached the filmmakers and agreed to go on camera, against the advice of his lawyers, he had already weathered one murder case, winning an acquittal in a gory Galveston, Texas, dismemberment case by claiming he shot his neighbor in self-defense. He was still suspected in the killing of Berman, whose father was a Las Vegas mobster associated with Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, and the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, who was declared dead long after she vanished in New York in 1982. Susan Berman was found shot execution-style outside her home in LA in 2000. Her friend, Robert Durst, was charged with her murder on Monday . Kathleen's brother, Jim McCormack, told Today on Tuesday that he believed Durst's confession was genuine and an admission that the 71-year-old had killed his sister decades before. Mr McCormack said: 'The revelation was like something we‘ve been waiting for 33 years.' He added: 'I believe that Bob will somehow have an epiphany of conscience, contrary to the advice of lawyers. 'I think he’s about ready to say, ''You know, enough is enough. This is what Kathy would want and this is what I’m going to do.''' Susan Berman, 55, was shot once in the back of the head at her home near Beverly Hills shortly before New York investigators planned to question her about Kathleen Durst's disappearance. The documentary showed filmmaker Andrew Jarecki confronting Durst with a copy of an anonymous letter that alerted Beverly Hills police to look for a 'cadaver' at Berman's address. Durst offered that whoever sent it was 'taking a big risk. You're sending a letter to police that only the killer could have written.' Then, in the final episode, Jarecki revealed another envelope, which Durst acknowledged mailing to Berman, that has similar writing in block letters and also misspelled the address as 'Beverley.' 'I wrote this one but I did not write the cadaver one,' Durst said. But when shown an enlargement of both copies, Durst couldn't distinguish them. New York defense lawyer Michael Devorkin said the surprising thing was that police never unearthed the letter to Berman that filmmakers got their hands on. 'Even if Durst wasn't the prime suspect, you would think they would have been looking through all her papers to see if the person who killed her had ever written her a letter,' Devorkin said. 'Finding the letter was pure good fortune.' With the bathroom recording immediately following the confrontation over the two handwriting samples, prosecutors have strong evidence, said Devorkin, who handles white-collar criminal cases. 'How often do you have a Perry Mason moment to end your documentary?' he said. Robert Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack (pictured left),  has been missing since 1982.

Substituted into the game at the 71st minute, the London-born 21-year-old marked one of the most remarkable debuts in modern English football with a goal scored 80 seconds after taking the field. He also wrote his name into the record books - it was the third fastest goal scored by an England debutant behind John Cock in 1919 and Bill Nicholson, who netted after just 19 seconds on his England debut against Portugal in 1951 to set the record.

Kane nodded in the goal after getting on the end of a cross played in by Raheem Sterling . Here he is pictured celebrating his dream debut as he is crowded by his England team mates . The Wembley crowd erupted with joy when the 21-year-old scored with just his third touch . Kane heads the ball into the back of the net to etch his name into the England record books . It is just the latest step in a Roy of the Rovers-style meteoric rise for the youngster, who hadn't figured in Tottenham's first team plans regularly until the start of the season. Born in Chingford, London, Kane was playing for Ridgeway Rovers in east London - the same youth side David Beckham and Andros Townsend played for - when he was scouted by Gunners spies and joined the club as an eight-year-old. He spent a year in the red half of north London before returning to his amateur childhood side after Arsenal let him leave. From Ridgeway, he joined Watford's youth set up where he spent two months before being snapped up by Tottenham as an 11-year-old. From there he had loan spells of varying success at clubs that include Millwall and Leicester. Kane spent a year playing for Arsenal as a youngster. Here he is pictured bottom left with his team mates . Kane pictured in action against Southampton during his 2012 loan spell with Championship club Millwall . Former club mates, family and coaches have spoken of him as 'grounded', 'level headed' and a 'good natured' person who gives his best day-in day-out on the training pitch. Former Spurs manager David Pleat told the BBC: 'His feet are firmly on the ground. He is a very sensible boy, a modest, humble boy.' And former England striker Clive Allen said he was a 'fine young man' when he worked with him as a 16-year-old. 'You could see from the day he walked in he had a real desire to improve himself as a footballer and the one thing I'd say about him, which unfortunately you don't say about a lot of young footballers, is that he had a passion for the game.' Last month Kane was pictured in Marbella, Spain, treating his childhood sweetheart Katie Goodland to a romantic Valentine's Day meal. Kane was clearly enjoying his break in Marbella with girlfriend Katie Goodland when he posted this Instagram photo, captioned: 'Happy Valentines everyone' Harry Kane's reaction on social media revealed his delight with his performance. He wrote: 'Wow, words can't describe that feeling' and he described it as the best night of his life . And Kane's girlfriend wrote on Twitter that she was 'buzzing' and 'no-one deserves it more' The pair, who have been dating for three years, dined at La Sala, which is part-owned by former Spurs team-mate and good friend David Bentley, and stayed two nights at the 5-star Puente Romano Hotel. Following tonight’s game, Kane told ITV: 'It's the start I dreamed of, it's a little bit of a blur at the minute. 'It's the best moment by far, to represent your country at senior level is the top. 'Hopefully I can keep doing it and it's the first of many.' Captain Wayne Rooney, who had scored England's opener, added: 'It's fantastic, international football's different and to score after 80 seconds is incredible for Harry. 'We're all delighted and hopefully it's the first of many.'

"Amazon has  blasted federal regulators  for being slow to . approve commercial drone testing - and warned the United States is . falling behind other countries in the potentially lucrative area . of unmanned aviation technology. Less than a week after the Federal Aviation Administration . gave Amazon.com the green light to test a delivery drone . outdoors, the company told U.S. lawmakers that the prototype . drone had already become obsolete while the company waited more . than six months for the agency's permission. 'We don't test it anymore. We've moved on to more advanced . designs that we already are testing abroad,' said Paul Misener, . Amazon.com's vice president for global public policy. Scroll down for video . The company must supply monthly data to the regulators, and conduct flights at 400 feet (120 metres) orbelow and in 'visual meteorological conditions,' Amazon is developing aerial vehicles as part of Amazon Prime Air. The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds. About 86 percent of Amazon's deliveries are 5 pounds or less, the company said. 'We believe customers will love it, and we are committed to making Prime Air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so,' Amazon has said. 'Nowhere outside of the United States have we been required . to wait more than one or two months to begin testing,' Misener . said in written testimony submitted to the Senate Subcommittee . on Aviation Operations, Safety and Security. Misener said Amazon had applied on Friday for permission to . test a more advanced drone system and now hopes for quicker . approval. The Amazon.com case illustrates the frustrations of many . companies and industry lobbyists, who say the U.S. regulatory . process is not keeping up with rapidly developing drone . technology that could generate new revenues and cost savings for . a range of industries. Misener, who was scheduled to join a witness panel at the . subcommittee hearing, said European and other international . authorities have more 'reasonable' approaches that recognize the . potential economic benefits of commercial drone operations. 'This low level of government attention and slow pace are . inadequate, especially compared to the regulatory efforts in . other countries,' Misener said. 'The (FAA) already has adequate statutory authority. What . the FAA needs is impetus, lest the United States fall further . behind,' he added. Seattle-based Amazon.com, the largest e-commerce company in . the United States, wants to use drones to deliver packages to . its customers over distances of 10 miles (16 km)or more, which . would require drones to travel autonomously while equipped with . technology to avoid collisions with other aircraft. The FAA recently proposed rules that would lift the current . ban on most commercial drone flights, but several restrictions . attached would make package delivery and other business . applications unfeasible. Among other constraints, the proposed rules would limit . commercial drones to an altitude of 500 feet (150 metres), allow . flights only during daytime and require operators to keep the . aircraft in sight at all times. The agency does not expect to finalize the rules until late . 2016 or early 2017, according to government officials. During . this period, the current ban will stay in place; companies can . apply for exemptions to use drones for specific business . applications. The FAA has been slow to grant exemptions, however, granting . only 48 of several hundred requests. The Republican-led subcommittee called the hearing to . examine the agency's efforts to integrate unmanned aircraft . systems, or UAS, safely into U.S. airspace. Industry forecasters . say that drones would generate nearly $14 billion of U.S. economic activity in the first three years of integration and . $82 billion over a decade. Meanwhile, Australia, Canada, France and the United Kingdom . have progressed toward airspace integration and allow for . commercial use, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said . in a report to the subcommittee. Australia has granted operating certificates to 185 . businesses, while several European countries have granted . licenses to more than 1,000 operators, according to the report. While the GAO said overseas restrictions are similar to . those proposed by the FAA, it noted that France has begun to . allow beyond-line-of-sight operations on a limited basis.

The post also counseled that, despite 2015 marking two years since San Francisco's controversial nudity ban, no one has been cited during a naked ride. That appeared to have remained the case with Saturday's ride. However, the same wasn't true for a group of pro-nudity protesters last month when a demonstration in the Castro District was called to mark the second anniversary of the city law, which bans public nudity except at events whose sponsors obtain permits.

"Helena Bonham-Carter has credited Mozart with helping make her children 'unbelievably clever,'  it has been reported. The quirky actress revealed that she started educating her two children when they were still in the womb by playing them the music of the celebrated composer. 'I basically played Mozart and violin concertos again and again because it stimulated the inner ear of the unborn baby,' The newly-separated star, reportedly told Classic FM. 'And everything that they promised happened to both my children. They came out alert, unbelievably clever, and very relaxed.' Scroll down for video .

She split from the Nightmare before Christmas director in December last year. The actress, who is currently starring as the Fairy Godmother in Cinderella, described classical music as the 'soundtrack to my life,' as she spoke to Charlotte Green's Culture Club. She said she believes it can be a 'genuine healthy drug.' Finnish researchers discovered in 2013 that babies could remember music they were played in the womb for up to four months. Scientists at the University of Helsinki said exposure to music in the womb may influence a critical period of brain development . However, it did warn that those played classical music in the womb may not turn out cleverer than average. Linda Geddes, author of pregnancy book Bumpology, said at the time of the study: ‘There is still no good evidence that playing music to your bump will boost your baby’s brain development. ‘However, research suggests that unborn babies can learn to associate their mother relaxing with a particular song.' A 2014 study by the Institute of Education, based at the University of London, found that playing classical music  to children boost their concentration and self-discipline.

"A woman has been left ‘gobsmacked’ after a camera, packed with memories of her once in a lifetime trip to Antarctica, is on its way back to her after she lost it three months ago on a snowy iceberg. Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to the remote region costing around $13,000 after being invited along by friends who had a spare place on their trip. She’d loaded her iPad up with episodes of American comedian Ellen DeGeneres’s chat show to entertain her while travelling to Antarctica and had been watching a Robin Williams episode with her fellow travellers in the moments before she lost her camera. Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera. ‘We spent an open night on an iceberg, the only thing around us were penguins and seals lazing around. I took the camera out of my pocket and said “everyone let’s do a very Merry Christmas from Antarctica to Ellen because she’s entertaining us at the bottom of the earth”,’ Ms Boz explained. 'Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera!': This is the distinctive photo that helped tour operator staff identify Hulia Boz from the photos on her lost camera . Moments after recording the festive message on December 12, on day seven of her trip to Earth's southernmost continent, Ms Boz got up to go to the ‘bathroom’. ‘You’ve got to build a wall from ice to go to the toilet. I went to do my wee and the camera must have fallen out of my pocket, I didn’t realise,’ she said. The 34-year-old was unaware that she’d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings. ‘The ship started to pull away and I thought “where is the camera? Where is the camera?” and we thought “no we were going to send it to Ellen!”,’ Ms Boz laughed. The story of how Ms Boz is now being reunited with her camera, which was white and camouflaged in the snow, is nothing short of a miracle. Before departing on the ship to Antarctica, Ms Boz and the rest of her tour group had mugshots taken at the port in Ushuaia, Argentina – the southernmost city in the world - where they sailed from. All tourists heading to Antarctica have these photos taken so they can be officially identified if need be. Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to Antarctica when she lost her camera. She took the white Canon camera along on her trip so she could capture 'silly' photos and used her professional cameras for landscape photography . This picture shows Hulia's friend cosying up with a seal in Antarctica. Her friend took photos on her camera and shared them with Hulia when her camera was lost . She was lucky enough to get a spare place on the trip which cost her around $13,000 after being invited along by friends . Hulia and her fellow tourists were watching an Ellen DeGeneres episode before she lost her camera . A traveller with a different tour company, Quark Expeditions, miraculously found Ms Boz’s camera in the snow on the same iceberg near Useful Island in February and took it back to the port in Ushuaia, where they handed it in. Polar Operations Manager for Aurora travel Tomas Holik was given the camera ‘with no marking nor name on it’ and looked through the pictures stored on it, leading him to figure out that it belonged to Ms Boz as he compared the photos to the mugshots taken from recent expeditions. 'Once they saw all the young faces in the recording they found a voyage that happened to have young people on it.... they then sent my selfie to the ship's team leaders asking if they knew who I was,' Ms Boz explained. ‘By looking at its pictures I figured out that it belongs to a passenger of EAP27,’ Mr Holik wrote in an email to the Sydney-based tour company that Ms Boz travelled with. Before Hulia knew that she would ever be reunited with her lost camera her friend sent her these photos that she had taken of her . The 34-year-old was unaware that she’d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings . Amongst the many memories from her two-week trip where plenty of fun selfies taken in the stunning snowy environment . The group were camping out on an iceberg in  Useful Island in December when she lost her camera . Assistant expedition leader Robyn Mundy replied: ‘I am amazed and astonished that someone found the camera. And returned it! We looked for it on the following voyage but there was still too much snow cover to find a white camera.’ ‘It does indeed belong to one of our EAP27 passengers, Hulia Boz. Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera! If you could possibly get it back to Sydney via a staff member or passenger, I’m sure Hulia will be eternally grateful,’ Ms Mundy replied. Ms Boz’s camera, which amazingly still works, is now on its way back to Sydney. ‘When they told me the person’s flight details and the name I thought this is really real. I hadn’t put out a plea on social media because there is nothing there but ice and penguins,' she said. Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera . Hulia still intends to send the Christmas message to Ellen once her camera returns to her, even if it is a bit late . This photo shows the ship that the group travelled from Argentina to Antarctica in over four days . Hulia has called the trip and the surprise of someone finding her camera in the remote snow 'the most over whelming experience of my life' 'The effort, patience and goodwill that was put into reuniting me with my memories by strangers has amazed me. It has restored my faith in humanity. 'My camera was identified as my property by a selfie I had taken and the footage my friends and I had taken to send to Ellen DeGeneres as that was the last thing on the camera . 'I am one lucky person who is grateful and overwhelmed by this all. Miracles do happen. Even if Antarctica is twice as big as Australia. Even with no permanent residence. Even if the colour of my camera was white and would be difficult to detect on ice,' she said happily. 'This truly was and probably will be the most over whelming experience of my life. I met some amazing talented people who I shared some very special memories with, built friendships for life, did some crazy things and most of all have one amazing story to tell my grand kids one day.'","Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, travelled to Antarctica via Argentina in December .

"A former Penthouse Pet accused of smuggling the drug 'ice' into Australia has broken down in court while detailing her former addiction and a suicide attempt. At a sentence hearing at Sydney's District Court on Tuesday, Simone Farrow said her mother told her when she was a teenager it was OK to be a prostitute. The 39-year-old, who is also known as Simone Cheung and by her professional name Simone Starr, was arrested in October 2009 by Australian Federal Police on her return from the United States. Scroll down for video . Former Penthouse Pet Simone Farrow (pictured) has broken down in court after revealing her extreme addiction to the drug 'ice' It is alleged Farrow smuggled methylamphetamine inside bath products and 'large sums' had been transferred into her bank account. Farrow said she abused prescription drugs and smoked ice daily while in the US. 'I couldn't basically function unless I smoked it,' she said. The former model became emotional while describing her childhood, saying her mother used to lock her in a room and alleged she had taken her to a brothel when she was 17 and told her 'it was okay to do that work'. When she was 20, Farrow said she worked at an escort agency. While at the business she claimed a man whom she 'gave all my money to', held her by her feet over the edge of an apartment at Rushcutters Bay in Sydney's east. Given her mother's lifestyle, which allegedly involved bouncing between partners and taking drugs, Farrow said she thought she believed she was 'a mistake'. 'I don't have any brothers and sisters,' she said. Farrow, who suffers from a range of mental health issues, including bipolar and depression, said she's proud of being drug free for the two years and seven months she's spent in custody. The 39-year-old, who is also known as Simone Cheung and by her professional name Simone Starr, was arrested in October 2009 by Australian Federal Police on her return from the United States . On September 13, 2013, Farrow pleaded guilty to importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug. She denied that she was an international leader of a drug ring and claimed she had been set up. In court she said she was unknowingly set up by some employees who had obtained complete control of her bank, phone and email accounts and ran the drug ring behind her back. Ms Farrow's lawyer told the court that if buyers believed she was behind the syndicate, it was because her employees would have imitated her way of speaking in order to pass off as her. Farrow was looking noticeably less glamorous as she was led into court in handcuffs after her arrest . The Australian Federal Police arrested Ms Farrow in 2012 at the Gold Coast before extraditing her to Sydney. Prosecutors maintain that she controlled the drug ring while pursuing a career in the United States as Simone Starr. Prosecutors claim they have video footage of Ms Farrow smoking drugs and claimed in court she personally intimidated buyers who owed her thousands of dollars by threatening to send bikies to manhandle them. The court also heard from a number of Farrows buyers who claimed they dealt directly with her, paying her $7000 per ounce. Farrow was a jet-setter, splitting her time between Australia's Gold Coast and a luxury apartment in Hollywood, California . A man said to be her drug dealer and whom he claims she referred to as 'dad' told the court: 'no one would [know to] call me ""dad"" [besides her] and no one would know the things we know,' the Sunday Telegraph reported. He claimed the former swimsuit model was always asking him for more money and exploited their business relationship. Mr Muratti, another witness from Melbourne who allegedly bought ice from Ms Farrow, and also claimed to have spoken directly to her. He told the court that the drugs were shipped to him concealed as bath salts, although he conceded much of that period was a 'blur'. The hearing continues.","Former Penthouse Pet Simone Farrow has broken down in court .

She boarded a British Airways flight to Istanbul on December 6, without the knowledge of her parents, months before her schoolmates made their successful attempt. Her plane was held as it taxied for take-off and was turned around at the last minute. All four of the aspiring jihadists followed their friend Sharmeena Begum who first went to the Middle East to join IS. All of the girls knew each other well.

"A  'sexy' Czech hunter who was criticised after posting sickening selfies with her big game trophies has ignored calls to stop - and uploaded  a video showing how to cook zebra. Michaela Fialova travels all over the world to hunt and regularly posts pictures on Facebook of herself with the dead animals. She has been slammed for the photos and a campaign was even launched to close down the 27-year-old's page and ban her from entering Africa. But the brunette has caused further outrage after continuing to gloat about fresh kills including giraffe and zebra. Scroll down for video . Michaela Fialova, who was criticised after posting sickening selfies with her big game trophies on Facebook, has ignored calls for her to stop - and uploaded a video showing how to cook zebra . In the video the 27-year-old can be seen preparing zebra and impala steaks in a small kitchen . Ms Fialova, who has been hunting since she was 13 years old, has already travelled to Slovakia and Hungary this year, where she shot boar, capercaillie and muflon. She is currently in South Africa and has already posted pictures of herself with a giraffe, hyena and water buck. The brunette, who is from Litomerice, Czech Republic, spends the rest of her time working as a personal trainer, kick-boxer and guide for other hunters in Africa and Europe. She described hunting as 'memories that will last a lifetime'. The 27-year-old personal trainer, who has been hunting since she was 13 years old, regularly updates her fans on the social media site . The 'sexy hunter' uses two large frying pans to cook dozens of the zebra and impala steaks . Other 'trophies' Ms Fialova has posed next to include this beautiful, endangered lion . The pictures show the weapons Ms Fialova uses, including several different guns and even a crossbow . She wrote on her page earlier this year: 'Have you ever dreamed of hunting in Africa but always thought you couldn't afford it? 'For the price of a good Elk or Red stag, you can go to Africa and take a few animals for the same price and have memories that will last a lifetime.' Ms Fialova is sometimes snapped brandishing the trophies alongside female friends, but in one is seen kissing an ex-boyfriend while holding a monkey. She gains most of her ammunition and clothing through sponsoring. Her page has already gained more than 20,500 'likes'. This year Ms Fialova, from Litomerice, Czech Republic, has already killed and posed with a giraffe in South Africa . In some the Czech brunette stands next to her trophies. But in others, like this one, she gives the photographer a 'thumbs up' She wrote on her page: 'For the price of a good Elk or Red stag, you can go to Africa and take few animals for the same price and have memories that will last a lifetime' Her antics have resulted in an online petition on website change.org titled 'Ban Michaela Michaelka Fialova from Africa and shut down her Facebook page promoting trophy hunting as being a glamorous thing to do'. It was created by Alice Harding, from Dartmouth, England, who described hunting as 'despicable'. She said: 'It's repulsive to glorify trophy hunting and sadistic practices such as bow hunting and posing with dead bodies of animals as if hunting is an appealing and desirable thing to do. 'Killing animals for fun is just plain wrong and must be stopped.' She is sometimes snapped brandishing the trophies alongside female friends, but in one is seen kissing an ex-boyfriend while holding a monkey . A petition has been set up on change.org to stop Ms Fialova. It reads: 'It's despicable and repulsive to glorify trophy hunting and sadistic practices such as bow hunting' Ms Fialova, posing above with a boar in Slovakia, has vowed she will never stop hunting and refers to those against it as 'antis' But despite criticism Ms Fialova, who refers to those against hunting as 'antis', wrote on Facebook on February 24: 'Hey antis, do you really think this will stop me? I WILL NEVER STOP HUNTING.' And in a video posted at the beginning of March, she explained: 'The difference between this meat and your meat is your meat is usually from slaughterhouses. 'The animal has a right to live a proper life and until its end it doesn't know about being hunted' (sic). The petition was started on February 18 and has been signed by nearly 6,000 supporters.","Michaela Fialova travels the world to hunt and posts pictures on Facebook .

"Neymar may only be 23-years-old, but the Brazilian sensation is in line to make his 300th club appearance in Barcelona's league match with Eibar on Saturday. The Barca forward will return from his one-game ban for picking up five cautions this season to 'complete the trident' alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, enthuses Mundo Deportivo. Neymar has played 225 games for Santos and 74 for the Catalan side - who face a potentially season defining period in the coming week with a Champions League decider against Manchester City on Wednesday and El Clasico next Sunday. Neymar is set for a landmark 300th club appearance (left) while Real Madrid's 'crisis' rumbles on (right) The Brazilian returns from a ban to complete Barca's 'trident' with Luis Suarez (left) and Lionel Messi . The club, Josep Bartomeu and Sandro Rosell are also set to appear in court over alleged tax offences with Barca insisting they will appeal the charge. Elsewhere in Spain, all attention has been consumed by the enduring 'crisis' at the Bernabeu where Real Madrid are only a point off the pace in La Liga after having stuttered into the quarter finals of the Champions League. Marca insists 'Another Madrid Is Possible' before listing 10 ways that Los Blancos can get their season back on track, including changing the system and the return of former Tottenham playmaker Luka Modric to restore fluidity to the midfield. Juventus will cast their eye over Paulo Dybala (left) while Marco Verratti is 'Best Player In Italy' The Italian fights for the ball with Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas during PSG's Champions League triumph . However, AS believes it is red card-prone defender Sergio Ramos who can 'come to the rescue' by returning to face Levante in preparation for next week's showdown at the Nou Camp. Meanwhile, in Italy Paris Saint Germain's heroic victory over Chelsea to reach the Champions League quarter finals has seen pint sized playmaker Marco Verratti hailed as 'The Best Player in Italy' by Gazetta dello Sport. The Argentine forward Dybala has also been linked with a summer move to Manchester United . The 22-year-old has been largely overlooked by the national team, although the paper run what appears to be a request to manager Antonio Conte, saying: ‘Dear Conte, I am ready to play like Pirlo... I know that I can give a lot for the Azzurri in front of the defence. Jose Mourinho remains a great, but we got such sweet revenge!’. Conte's former club side Juventus face Palermo this weekend with current manager Massimiliano Allegri warning his side not to become preoccupied by next week's European return leg against Borussia Dortmund - where the Italians carry a 2-1 advantage to Germany. Corriere dello Sport also claim that the Old Lady will be casting her eye over Palermo forward Paulo Dybala who has also been linked with Manchester United.","Neymar set to make 300th club appearance against Eibar on Saturday .

"Anyone struggling to decide on a venue for their upcoming nuptials, take note. American couple Cheetah Platt, 30, and Rhiann Woodyard, 32, have come up with the ultimate way to celebrate their love: by getting married in as many places around the world as they can in just under 90 days. The adventurous pair first came up with the globe-trotting plan after getting engaged last year - and finding themselves unable to come up with one specific theme or idea for the big day. Cheetah Platt, (left) 30, and Rhiann Woodyard (right) 32, from Los Angeles, have decided to get married in 12 countries around the world . The couple is currently in Chiang Mai, Thailand (pictured) after getting married in Spain, Ireland, Kenya, Egypt, Morocco and India . Woodyard and Platt will continue on from Thailand to Singapore, then heading to Australia and Fiji before heading home to the US . Their round the world adventure first began on February 8, when they packed two big backpacks and headed to Bogota, Colombia. During their three month journey, the couple hope to visit 11 countries to have 38 wedding ceremonies in 83 days. Platt and Woodyard, who live in Los Angeles, admit that they did look for a traditional venue in their hometown, but nothing felt special and many they saw were simply outside of their price range. 'A lot of women spend a whole lot of time and stress and money on their one day and then it's over,' Woodyard told Buzzfeed. 'I love that I get to marry [Platt] over and over again. 'It's exciting that it's not just done in one day.' They had gotten married 21 times as of Saturday, according to NBC Southern California. One of the couple's most recent stops? Egypt, where they tied the knot in front of an audience of camels and pyramids in the background . Platt and Woodyard first embarked on their round-the-world trip on February 8, flying to Bogota, Colombia, from Los Angeles . With the help of generous donors on Honeyfund, Platt and Woodyard are scheduled to have 38 ceremonies crammed into just 83 days . During their trip, the pair have decided to wear white at all times - and they will be married in the same outfits during each ceremony . On one of the first few stops, the couple stopped in Spain for a beautiful ceremony together amid the country's dramatic architecture . When they aren't officiating their stunning ceremonies, the couple takes in local experiences, like the Giraffe Center in Nairobi, Kenya . One of their favourite ceremonies took place in Mumbai, India. 'What a wonderful wedding!' Platt wrote. 'This ceremony meant so much.' With the help of honeymoon registry website, Honeyfund, the two were able to raise funds for their once in a lifetime journey. Posting the costs of the hotels they hoped to stay in and flights they hoped to take during their travels, Woodyard and Platt sourced the amounts needed to jet from the United States to Europe, Africa, Asia and everywhere in between, before returning to Los Angeles for a ceremony with friends and family in May. And forget paying for officiants in dozens of cities around the world. Woodyard and Platt were ordained online through the church of Spiritual Humanists so that they could marry each other. 'We're so excited for this once in a lifetime opportunity and we can't wait to make these dreams come true,' the pair wrote online. And the couple, who are both talented aerial performers, will also be using the experience as an opportunity to mix business with pleasure. 'Wedding in front of the Roman aqueduct in Segovia, Spain,' Platt captioned this snap on Facebook. 'How did I get to be so lucky?!' The couple's second ceremony, also in Colombia, took place in the lush greenery for which the South American country is known . In Ireland, the pair had three ceremonies in one day! Here, they are standing in Glendalough Cathedral in the Wicklow Mountains . Passersby often snap photos of the couple, who usually take their own photographs afterwards showcasing their aerial acrobatic skills . In between weddings, the pair carved out some time to take a stroll in one of Madrid's most famous parks, all the while wearing white . The couple have accumulated stunning photographs from their many weddings, including when they got married again in a 'romantic Casablanca' ceremony on an African evening . The first wedding took place in Colombia. 'Many more to come,' Platt posted on Facebook. 'I have finally married the woman of my dreams!' Woodyard made her own bouquet - using dollar store flowers and old costume jewellery. 'She is amazing,' Platt captioned the photo. 'We will be teaching, training and performing partner acrobatics all over the world,' they continued. 'It's such an incredible way for us to share our skills, our passion and our talents with others.' So far, Platt and Woodyard have visited Spain, Ireland, Kenya, Egypt, Morocco, India, and Thailand. Although they had originally hoped to be married on all seven continents, due to the cost associated with travelling to Antarctica, they opted to scrap that plan. With careful budgeting, the couple was able to to find 'round-the-world flights landing in 11 countries for less than $3,000 USD per person.' Their seemingly crazy plan may have actually saved them money, as the average American wedding approaches $30,000 in costs, according to The Knot. 'A lot of people say you should travel with the person you're going to marry,' Woodyard added. 'We get to learn about each other everyday more and more and I love that it's brought us close.' New of their journey has since been shared thousands of times on social media and spread all over the world they are traveling. The newlyweds say that their travels together have helped them grow closer and more and more in love each day . The couple have become Internet celebrities for their amazing adventure, though Woodyard said that the best part was inspiring someone else's wedding plans . Woodyard and Platt have been documenting their journey on Facebook and Twitter, and are accepting donations for their travels via Honeyfund . Woodyard said that more than their new-found fame, the most touching moment was a 'call with a bride in New England who says our story has helped inspire them to completely rework their wedding plans and they are going to explore travel and wedding ceremonies in their own way' 'It was so amazing to hear, and so moving. I've spent too much time crying tears of joy tonight,' she wrote. The couple are currently in Thailand, and will head for a layover in Singapore before going on to Australia and Fiji. For those looking to follow the couple on their journey, they are posting photos and updates on Facebook. They plan on going on a motorcycle tour of the southwest US once they arrive home and have a legally binding ceremony. Platt and Woodyard are also planning a reception for their many weddings in May. However, like their ceremonies, the party will not be the 'typical sit-down reception' and will host games of tag and a ball pit.","The couple first began their trek on February 8, flying from Los Angeles, California to Bogota, Colombia .

"A failure in LAPD handwriting analysis 14 years ago meant that Robert Durst was free to kill again, according to a search warrant. Durst, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family, was arrested in New Orleans over the weekend and charged with murder for the shooting of Susan Berman in December 2000. Police focused on Durst's handwriting 14 years ago, after a note in an envelope tipped them off to Berman's death. But a document examiner wrongly concluded that the handwriting did not match Durst's. Scroll down for video . Accused: Robert Durst was arrested after he seemed to give himself away during a taped interview for an HBO documentary investigating his possible links to three killings . Evidence: The handwriting on this notorious note that tipped off police was eventually matched to Durst . Missed: The handwriting was initially thought to belong to somebody else after LAPD analysts made errors in their assessment . Match: Eventually, the writing was compared against samples of Durst's writing and the similarities were found to be striking . Sinister: Robert Durst is escorted into Orleans Parish Prison after his arrest. He escaped police attention for years, partially due to a failed handwriting analysis 14 years ago . Writing on the note and envelope, which was written in block lettering, misspelled 'Beverley Hills Police' and included the word 'cadaver' along with Berman's Beverly Hills address. In 2001, Los Angeles Police Department document examiner William Leaver concluded it was 'highly probable' that it was written by Nyle Brenner, Berman's manager and friend. The assessment was 'rubber stamped' by Leaver's supervisor, who told detectives in September that she had not backed the findings up with an independent technical review. Investigators had  initially failed to analyze examples of Durst's handwriting, and it wasn't until eight months later that a comparison was made. Leaver said 'similarities' were enough to request more writing samples, which police eventually obtained. In June 2003, Leaver revised his assessment to conclude that the handwriting was likely Durst's. The conflicting analyses meant that valuable time lost. By then, Durst had been charged in Texas with the murder and dismemberment of Morris Black. Investigation: Law enforcement officers stand outside the Robert Durst's Houston home . Forensic: Durst himself may have implicated the property in a recording made while talking to himself after a tense interview for the HBO series . Eventually, the envelope, letter and writing samples were sent to the California Department of Justice and an investigator concluded that Durst was 'probably the author of the cadaver letter and note'. The Los Angeles case went dormant, and wasn't revived until 2012, when law enforcement learned of a six-part HBO series about his links to three killings entitled The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst. He is suspected of killing his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter of a mobster, who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas, whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001. The filmmakers say they shared tape with police months ago of interviews with Durst, including his reactions to handwriting analysis and what appears to be a confession to Berman's killing. In October and November, the LAPD had two independent examiners analyzed the documents and both concluded that Durst was the author. Durst was arrested earlier this month, shortly before the finale of the HBO documentary. He has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder. Authorities on Tuesday searched Durst's Houston home, and the warrant released Wednesday details the timeline of the Berman case. The LAPD has declined comment until Durst is in its custody. He is currently being held in Louisiana on gun charges. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said the conflicting determinations on the handwriting 'shows you what junk science really is.' He also questioned what evidence police expected to find in Durst's Houston home. But Durst himself may have implicated the property in a recording made while talking to himself after a tense interview for the HBO series, which concluded Sunday. Just before saying he 'killed them all,' he says, 'I don't know what's in the house'. The search warrant affidavit showed that authorities were concerned Durst, who has an estimated net worth of $100 million, might be preparing to flee the country. He had withdrawn large sums of money from multiple bank accounts, including daily amounts of $9,000, for 35 days starting in October. Durst was under FBI surveillance. Agents arrested him in a New Orleans hotel under the name 'Everette Ward,' finding nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his room, the affidavit says. A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said that it was a kind of 'old man mask', and investigators were looking at whether he had been using it to travel anonymously. Durst could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Berman.","In 2001, police analysed the handwriting on a note alerting them to the death of Susan Berman .

"The FBI is investigating the death of a black man in Mississippi, who was found hanging from a tree Thursday morning. The victim has been identified as Otis James Byrd, 54, who went missing on March 2 after his friend dropped him off at a casino in Vicksburg,  30 miles north from where his body was discovered. His family reported him missing on March 8. The NAACP was the first to identify Byrd. Officials have not yet confirmed the victim's identity, but local authorities were searching for the missing man when they found the body. If the death is ruled a murder, the NAACP's concerns are that is has echoes of a lynching. Byrd was convicted of murder in 1980, but was then paroled in 2006. He shot dead a white woman named Lucille Trim as he carried out an armed robbery. Scroll down for video . What happened? Otis James Byrd, 54 (pictured left and right), was found hanging from a tree in Mississippi after he went missing March 2 . Local, state and federal investigators are combing the scene off Old Rodney Road to determine the cause of death. He was found about 200 yards from his home. 'We don't know right now. All I can say is what I told you: It's under investigation,' Coroner J.W. Mallett said. Jim Walker, spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks said the body had 'obvious signs' of decay, suggesting it had been hanging there for at least a day. Mystery: Above, a hearse is seen parked near the scene of the hanging on Thursday. Investigators are trying to determine whether Byrd's death was a homicide or suicide . Without a trace: The body was found in a wooded area near Old Rodney Road in Port Gibson, Mississippi about 200 yards from his home. The last time he was seen, a friend was dropping him off at a casino in Vicksburg . Dark past: Above, Byrd's parole board mugshot. He was released from prison in 2006 after spending 25 years in prison for a murder conviction . The owner of the land, 87-year-old Johnie Baker, said that the area where Byrd's body was found is covered in pecan and black walnut trees. He added that hunters sometimes hunt in the area and that there are also wild boars on the land. So far, authorities say it's too early to determine whether the victim's death was a homicide or a suicide. However, the NAACP is petitioning to have the U.S. Department of Justice involved in the investigation, fearing Byrd's death may have been a hate crime. The Claiborne County Sheriff's Department and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation are also involved in the investigation. Lynching was a common form of 'mob justice' in the late 19th century, particularly in the south. A report by the Equal Justice Initiative claims there were nearly 4,000 lynchings of African Americans in the Jim Crow era across 12 states of the US. Byrd spent 25 years in prison for the murder of Lucille Trim, the Clarion-Ledger reported according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. He allegedly robbed Trimm of $101 and then killed her. He was convicted of capital murder in February 1980 and then was paroled in November 2006. Trim is the mother of Martha Ranville, who was the first woman in the history of the National Guard to serve as State Adjuntant General. She became the Adjutant General in Vermony in 1997 and currently lives in Virginia with her husband, the Hon. Paul McHale. McHale is a former Pennsylvania congressman and assistant secretary of defense.","Body of African-American man found hanging from tree in Port Gibson, Mississippi, Thursday morning .

"Smiling sweetly for the camera, this is Susan Berman as she looked when she met the man who would become her lifelong friend - and alleged killer - Robert Durst. Three decades after these happy photos were taken she was murdered in cold blood - a crime for which her University of California pal Durst has now been charged. These never-before-seen student photos of Susan obtained exclusively by Daily Mail Online were taken at UCLA, where the pair met. Durst, now 71, was sensationally charged with the writer's murder last Saturday - the day before his shocking 'confession' to the killing aired in HBO documentary The Jinx. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Graduate: Susan Berman as she was when she graduated from UCLA in 1967. She returned as a graduate student and met Robert Durst who was also there as a graduate student . Charged: Durst smiling as he leaves court in New Orelans last week. He was wanted in California for the murder of Susan Berman after the HBO documentary series The Jinx produced new evidence about her death . Victim: Susan Berman, pictured in Las Vegas in 1996. She was shot dead in her Beverly Hills home on Christmas Eve 2000 and although Robert Durst was a suspect, he was never arrested until now . Friends: Susan Berman and Robert Durst together. They had become close friends when they met at UCLA where both were graduate students. A friend speculated that they bonded over the loss of their parents . Berman had been his close friend and acted as his spokesman in the wake of the disappearance of his wife in 1982. Although Durst was suspected of being involved in the disappearance, he was never charged. Susan's family are now hoping 'justice will prevail', 15 years after the 55-year-old was found gunned down, 'execution-style' at her Beverly Hills home on Christmas Eve 2000. Durst was questioned over Berman's murder but only arrested when the finale of HBO's The Jinx last week revealed new evidence, including an apparent confession when he was taped saying: 'Killed them all.' Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online, Susan's cousin Deni Marcus said: 'I really want justice to prevail for my lovely cousin who should be here now watching my son, her nephew, all grown up and she does not get to do that. 'The loss of my cousin has never stopped stinging. We have been waiting for justice and I don't want anything to impede it. 'Please, please let there be justice for all [the victims] including my cousin.' Deni is the first family member to speak to the media since Durst's dramatic capture and arrest. Speaking from her home in Los Angeles, Deni continued: 'I want the process to proceed, I want it to be swift and be without a circus. 'Liberty and justice for all and I'm hoping it will be that for my cousin.' Deni added that the family are grateful to HBO for bringing the world's attention to Susan's brutal murder. She said: 'Anything that got us to this place I'm just grateful for it. Grateful and hopeful.' Susan met Durst in 1967 at UCLA.She had graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Sociology the spring before but returned to UCLA as a visiting student for two terms. Durst enrolled to study Economics in UCLA'S graduate school that same year. One close friend of Susan since the 1970s recalled how her friend first encountered the eccentric real estate heir in a chance meeting on campus. Sorority girl: In her 1965 UCLA yearbook picture, Susan Berman posed (top left) along with other members of her sorority Phi Sigma Sigma . Close: Susan Berman (right) and her cousin Deni Marcus (left) at a party. Marcus told Daily Mail Online that she hoped justice could be done swiftly and 'without a circus' Youth: Durst in 1961 in the Scarsdale High School, New York, yearbook. The friend, who asked not to be named, said: 'I think he saw her and was interested in her. I recall a story that he saw her and for some reason they started talking, it was an extremely casual thing.' Asked why Susan liked Durst, the pal reasoned: 'Their parents were both deceased.' Paying tribute to Susan, the friend said: 'She was into people, she was very interested in how people behaved. That was what she liked to write about, she was trying to make sense of her life. She was a very loyal friend, always there for you. 'You could talk to her about anything. When we were bored she always kept Scrabble on the table, if we were bored or upset, she would say ""let's play Scrabble"".' The friend is convinced Durst killed Susan and hopes there is enough evidence to convict him, adding: 'I think the DA has got a really good case, I'm really hoping he will be able to make it this time. He's had 15 years to gather evidence. I think he can do it.' In her 1965 UCLA yearbook shot Susan appeared on a page with her sorority Phi Sigma Sigma. In the second shot she is seen in her graduation outfit in 1967. Daily Mail Online tracked down one of her sorority sisters from UCLA at the time who spoke glowingly of her former friend. The former student who still lives in Los Angeles, but asked not to be named in fear of how Durst got off last time he was charged with murder, said: 'She was a smart girl. 'She was a darling, very cute, very honest, very bubbly, full of life and trying to make friends. She said her parents had both died and she was from Las Vegas. 'She was just a darling person, very friendly. She did not know much, she was quite innocent, completely I would say. 'I knew her for about two years from the sorority. She would speak to me about different things. I felt terrible when I heard about her being murdered. 'I felt so horrible for her. Truthfully I have been watching this case for years because Durst was the suspect. 'I have been watching for 15 years and I never believed it would blow up like this.' Clue: The spelling error in a letter sent to Berman by Durst and in an anonymous letter sent to police was uncovered by The Jinx's producers. It is now part of the reason for the arrest warrant issued in California . First 'victim': Kathleen Durst with Robert before she disappeared in 1982. Crime scene: The Benedict Canyon, LA, home of Susan Berman, where she was found murdered on Christmas Eve 200. Speaking out: Deni Marcus, Susan Berman's cousin . The friend - who knew Susan in her freshman and sophomore year - never met Durst. She said: 'I never knew him, I don't think I was there when she met him.' Durst himself, speaking on The Jinx, says: 'My very first summer there [at UCLA] I met Susan. We became best friends right away.' And he explained: 'Susan and I would spend a lot of time together we could talk, we had the thing in common, both of her parents died when she was young and I had one parent die when I was young. 'Rich, Las Vegas, mobster father.' When asked for the official records of when Susan and Durst attended UCLA, spokesman Ricardo Vazquez said: 'Susan Berman was an undergraduate student between summer of 1964 and spring of 1967. 'She got a Bachelor degree in Sociology. She came back as a visiting student in fall 1967 until winter 1968. Robert Durst was a graduate student in Economics between fall of 1967 and Spring of 1969. He did not complete the course.' Berman's murder is the charge which Durst was arrested over last week in New Orleans in a dramatic swoop by local officers. They were acting on a warrant issued in California after the HBO series came up with new evidence, including how a letter Durst sent to Berman and an anonymous one telling police they could expect to find a 'cadaver' at her house contained the same mis-spelling of Beverly Hills as Beverley Hills. Durst was also captured on tape saying to himself, after filming had ended: 'There it is. You're caught. Killed them all. Of course.' His lawyer is challenging the 'confession', describing it as 'one of 100 possible things', including a Shakespearean 'soliloquy'. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. Durst was transferred to a prison wing for the mentally ill in New Orleans last week - while he awaits extradition to LA to face the first-degree murder charge - because he is considered a suicide risk. In 2003 he was acquitted of the murder of Morris Black, a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, who he admitted killing in self-defense. He also admitted dismembering the dead man's body.","Susan Berman became friends with eccentric real estate heir Robert Durst when they both studied at UCLA .

Witnessing everyone take their clothes off and leave them in a pile is really quite profound,' he said. 'You realise how complex and socially fabricated we are, connected through clothes'. Ringholt is no stranger to nude education, having guided similar tours at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and MONA in Tasmania. The tours, which will run outside of regular exhibition hours on April 1 and 2, are an hour-long adventure through Turrell's body of work, and include installations purpose-built for Canberra, as well as drawings, prints and photographs. The custom built light program will project different colours onto the viewers, which Ringholt said will be one of the most interesting elements of the nude tour. The tour guide for the retrospective, which highlights the 70-year-old American artist's 50 years of work, will be Melbourne-based artist Stuart Ringholt (far right) Mr Turrell's retrospective highlights the 70-year-old American artist's 50 years of work . The custom built light program will project different colours onto the viewers . He expects people 'from all walks of life' to join in the tours, and was adamant about offering concessions for the exhibition so that a cross section of society might be emboldened to give nudity a go. 'We all share the same humanity, and it's wonderful to see people come along and be so happy. I liken the tours to a 40th birthday party of a reunion of long lost friends,' Ringholt said. 'We often get nudists who are really excited to come to events, because for them it's exciting that society is saying ""you're ok, you can participate"",' he said. 'Art students also tend to come along, but there is always someone who has never done something like this before,' 'I had one woman who was so nervous but came up to me afterwards and thanked me for running the tour because she had had so much shame around her body and was able to over come her fears.' 'We drink light through the skin as Vitamin D... so we are literally light eaters. It's part of our diet,' said Turrell . The tours, which will run outside of regular exhibition hours on April 1 and 2, are an hour-long adventure through Turrell's body of work . Ringholt maintains that there is nothing sexual about the tours, and said that the human body is more sexualised with clothes on. 'With clothes on, the imagination is engaged, but with them off, there isn't the same hook. The body is quite de-sexualised,' Ringholt said. 'People don't believe me when I say this, but people all look the same with their clothes off. An 18-year-old looks like a 70-year-old,' he said. 'It sounds ridiculous but until you've actually seen people in a group, nude, looking at art respectfully, it's hard to understand.' The artist, who has previously run a nude night club experience called Club Purple, began performing nude in his 20's as a way to explore the issues of shame and embarrassment. He said that nude tours in particular are excellent vehicles for promoting acceptance of one's body, and also to engage in an activity normally considered quite risque. The tour include installations purpose-built for Canberra, as well as drawings, prints and photographs . Turrell is fascinated by the element of light, and uses the term 'skyclad' instead of nude . 'It's illegal to be nude in public, so to be naked in what is normally a very public space is a form a mild protest,' Ringholt said. 'I think it's an excellent way to accept your body, and generate some self love. It's not negative, no one is looking and judging,' he said. The artist whose work is the impetus for the tours, James Turrell, was reportedly very keen to have viewers of his work wander around and experience it nude. A nude tour for one of his exhibitions was previously held in Japan, and Ringholt said he expressed interest in having the tour replicated at the Australian retrospective. Turrell sees nothing wrong with nudity and explains: 'We drink light through the skin as Vitamin D... so we are literally light eaters. It's part of our diet.' Mr Ringholt has already been the guide on nude gallery tours at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and MONA in Tasmania . 'He produces skyspaces (above), and his art has a really beautiful relationship with light perception, stars, the heavens, all things celestial,' Ringholt said . Ringholt said that Turrell is fascinated by the element of light, and uses the term 'skyclad' instead of nude. 'He produces skyspaces, and his art has a really beautiful relationship with light perception, stars, the heavens, all things celestial,' he said. Paul Matthews, who participated in one of the nude tours run by Ringholt at the Museum of Contemporary Art, said that it was a unique experience to be in a public setting with other people while naked. Matthews, a nudist, said that he felt some of the installations were 'made complete' by the nude spectators, and that he didn't believe the experience would have been the same had the group been clothed. 'I don't think I could ever visit the MCA clothed after this tour,' he said.","Naked art fans will view the exhibition, 'James Turrell: A Retrospective' at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra .

"Alice Moffat received a parking ticket after leaving her car in front of her own family's driveway- despite displaying her visitor's badge . A driver was left furious after she received a parking ticket for pulling up outside her parents' home. Alice Moffat was  hit with the £25 fine after she parked her car across the driveway while visiting April and Steve Moffat at their house in Yeovil, Somerset. The 23-year-old, from Redhill, Surrey, had even placed the visitor's permit in the window just in case and left it overnight. But she was shocked when she returned to the car the next morning to find a traffic warden had slapped a ticket on the red Renault  because it was parked just centimetres outside a marked bay. Ms Moffat, whose family have lived in Yeovil for 15 years, said: 'I drove back to the family home late, and parked over my parents' drive as I almost always do when I know they are not needing to go out that night. 'Just to be on the safe side, I also put the visitors permit in my car - not that it really needs to be there as I'm over my parents' drive. 'My brother saw a parking warden looking at my car. He thought this was unusual so went out to see what was wrong. I was shocked to discover the parking warden was issuing me a ticket. 'My younger brother immediately asked why, he said 'the permit is in, it's my sisters car so we're allowed to park over our own drive' but the parking warden simply replied saying the car was 'outside of a marked bay. 'He meant my wheel was a fraction over the white line of the bay behind, but not obstructing anyone or any car.' Ms Moffat, an actuary, said she and her brother had tried to reason with the warden, and had offered the move the car immediately to no avail. 'The warden replied saying he had already printed the ticket so there was no point,' she added. The 23-year-old had parked in front of the drive in Yeovil, Somerset (pictured) but was given a fine after being told she had not parked in the correct bay . 'I nearly always park over my parents drive, I had a permit in my car to be sure it was okay, and if I was a few centimetres forward, it would not have affected anybody or any car. 'I am now left with fine to pay because my car was parked over my own family's driveway. 'I think this shows very clearly what all the national press are saying, councils in England are simply using parking fines as a 'cash cow'. 'They were going so by the book and they didn't use any common sense.' Alice added: 'I have spoken to neighbours who said they have had a similar problem with getting parking fines while parked just slightly over the white lines. 'It's just so frustrating for my family, as they have to pay for their resident and visitor parking permits. The £25 fine, issued by a Somerset County Council civil enforcement officer has since been cancelled . 'They pay their way, and don't expect their family to get fined for parking over their own property.' A penalty charge notice was issued by Somerset County Council, stating the car was 'not parked correctly within the markings of the bay or space. ' A Somerset County Council spokesman said the civil enforcement officer was correct to serve a penalty but yesterday confirmed the ticket had been cancelled. He said: 'Having reconsidered the comments by the driver we have exercised our discretion and given her the benefit of the doubt and the penalty has been cancelled.'","Alice Moffat was hit with a £25 fine after parking her car across the drive .

"A Pennsylvania mother called the man who murdered her son 'the devil' and said she was 'satisfied' he would 'spend eternity suffering in hell' as he was sentenced on Friday to life in prison. Hugo Selenski, 41, was convicted last month of two counts of first-degree murder for killing pharmacist Michael Kerkowski and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett in 2002 as part of a robbery plot. Michael's mother, Geraldine Kerkowski, read from a statement during sentencing at the Luzerne County Courthouse in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, but frequently looked Selenski in the eye. Hugo Selenski got a life sentence at the Luzerne County Courthouse in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on Friday . Selenski, 41 (seen in 2003) was convicted of murdering Michael Kerkowski and Tammy Fassett in 2002 . Geraldine Kerkowski, seen on Friday, read a statement during the sentencing and called Selenski the devil . While Kerkowski expressed her contempt and hatred for him, Selenski glanced toward the rest of the victims' family members and appeared to smirk. Kerkowski, 71, called Selenski a 'useless waste of space and air' and declared, 'You are going straight to hell.' She said: 'I know I can be satisfied knowing you will spend eternity suffering in hell, because there is going to be an eye for an eye. 'Hugo, you know you will be right where you will belong, in hell with Satan because you are the devil in every sense of the word.' Fassett's sister, Lisa Sands, told Selenski: 'I know you have no remorse for what you've done because I can tell by the look on your face right now. 'You get to see your family. 'I have to go to a gravesite to see my sister. 'Now do you really think that's fair?'' Selenski was charged with killing Kerkowski and Fassett in 2006 after beating two other homicide charges . Their bodies of Michael and Tammy Fassett were among at least five sets of human remains found in Selenski's yard in 2003. Prosecutors said Selenski and a co-conspirator brutally beat Michael to compel him to reveal the location of tens of thousands of dollars he kept in his house, then used plastic flex ties to strangle him and Fassett. Kerkowski, who considered Selenski his best friend, had pleaded guilty to running an illegal prescription drug ring and was about to be sentenced when he and Fassett were reported missing in 2002. After Michael was already dead, Selenski approached his parents and claimed their son was alive and needed money to pay a new defense team. They gave Selenski $60,000. Kerkowski said: 'He knew he killed my son, and for a year he was at our door, looking for money, trying to make us believe that Michael was still alive.' Judge Fred Pierantoni sentenced Selenski to consecutive life terms plus a maximum of 120 years, ensuring that Selenski will 'never again walk the streets of this commonwealth or this community'. Selenski murdered Michael Kerkowski (left), a pharmacist, and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett (right) in 2002 . Kerkowski, 71, called Selenski a 'useless waste of space and air' and declared, 'You are going straight to hell' After his arrest, Selenski broke out of the Luzerne County Prison (above) by making a rope from bed sheets. Selenski maintains his innocence and is planning an appeal. His accomplice, 45-year-old Paul Weakley, pleaded guilty to federal charges and is serving life in prison, according to the Times-Tribune. Several months after his arrest, Selenski broke out of the Luzerne County Prison by fashioning a rope from bed sheets. He pleaded guilty to escape charges and was sentenced separately Friday to a maximum of three years and five months in prison, time already served. Selenski was charged in the deaths of Kerkowski and Fassett in 2006 after beating homicide charges for two of the other bodies found in the yard. The fifth set of remains recovered by police was too badly burned and could not be identified.","Hugo Selenski convicted of two counts of first-degree murder last month .

"Ahizya Osceola's body was discovered in an obscure location inside the home late Thursday night (above Ahizya, three, pictured above) The body of a missing three-year-old boy was found  inside his Florida family home where he lived with his father, step mother and two siblings. Ahizya Osceola's body was discovered in an 'obscure location' inside the home late Thursday night, according to Hollywood Police Chief Frank Fernandez. Authorities had been searching for the boy since he was reported missing on Thursday at approximately 11.48am. The search ended tragically Thursday night about 12 hours later when the body was discovered, and police announced on Friday around 5.40am, that the public's help was no longer needed. Chief Fernandez would not give further details on whether the child's body had possibly been hidden in this 'obscure location' or if he died accidentally while hiding there, according to the Sun-Sentinel. However, he said on Friday morning during a press conference that a criminal investigation was ongoing. It was also announced that the young child's body was being processed by Broward Medical Examiner's Office. Authorities had been searching for the boy since he was reported missing Thursday at approximately 11.48am (above Hollywood police gather in front of the home where Ahizya was found on March 20) Once his Ahizya's is released, he will be buried at the Big Cypress Seminole Indian reservation - the child's parents, Nelson Osceola and Karen Cypress are members of the Seminole Tribe of Florida. Nelson, 24, told authorities he had last seen his son at 4am on Thursday when he went to check on his eight-month-old daughter at the home located on Johnson Street. He  said his wife, who has not been identified, was awake and the boy was still sleeping when he left home at 7.30am. He was in contact with his wife for a couple of more hours that morning before she fell back asleep with the baby, and woke up realizing he had disappeared. She told Osceola that Ahizya was missing through a text message. Karen made an emotional plea to the public on Thursday after her son was reported missing.

"Enjoy a dip in the sea and you risk picking up antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching the E.coli bug as they are more likely to swallow contaminated water, a study has suggested. Scientists at the University of Exeter have warned of the danger after analysing data collected from beaches across England and Wales in 2012. They focused on a strain of E.coli bacteria resistant to an important class of antibiotics called third-generation cephalosporins, or 3GCs. Swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching the E.coli bug as they are more likely to swallow contaminated water, a study has suggested . Study leader Dr William Gaze said: 'We know very little about how the natural environment can spread antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans, or how our exposure to these microbes can affect health. 'People are exposed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria in many ways, through person-to-person contact, via food and as a result of international travel. 'Our research establishes recreational use of coastal waters as an additional route of exposure. 'With millions of people visiting beaches in England and Wales each year, there is a risk of people ingesting 3GC resistant E. coli and it looks like water-users' exposure to all resistant bacteria could be even higher.' If you enjoy a dip in the sea and you risk picking up a strain of E.coli bacteria (pictured) resistant to an important class of antibiotics . Salt in sea water is known to kill off some bacteria, but not all. Although only 0.12 per cent of the E.coli found in coastal waters and rivers running on to beaches belonged to the strain, researchers said this was enough to present a 'potential risk'. The study, published in the journal Environment International, showed risk of exposure was closely related to the water quality at any given beach. Researchers said this demonstrated the importance of the EU's Bathing Water Directive, which aims to ensure good water quality standards, but added that people should not be put off visiting the seaside.","Swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching E.coli bug, study claims .

"The parents of a newborn baby have been left traumatised after they were handed the wrong baby due to a maternity ward mix-up and spent 45 minutes with a child who was not theirs. The parents say the trauma of the incident has affected their ability to connect with their son. Samantha and Nick Stuhlener welcomed baby Levi in January and were enjoying their precious first moments together at St Vincent's Private Hospital in the inner city Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy. However, the proud parents were horrified to discover that they spent 45 minutes with another couple's baby, after a nurse mistakenly brought another child to them from the 'settling room'. Scroll down for video . Levi was born on January 6 this year to proud parents Samantha and Nick Stuhlener at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Fitzroy . His mother, Samantha Stuhlener, has had trouble bonding with her cherished baby after a mix up at the hospital which saw her mistakenly spend 45 minutes with someone else's child . The two babies had been together in the overnight settling room at St Vincent's Private Hospital . 'I said what's happened, what's going on?' Ms Stuhlener told 7News. 'And she said, you didn't have Levi, you had somebody else's baby.' The error happened despite both infants wearing the correct identification wristbands in the settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross-check the tags and mistakenly brought Mr and Mrs Stuhlener someone else's child. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff. 'It is extremely regrettable and our staff and myself feel gutted by the incident. We unreservedly apologise and take full responsibility for the incident,' he told 7News. He emphasised that throughout the stay the babies were only touched, fed and changed by their parents. 'While both babies had correct identification name tags attached at all times and both babies remained in their correctly named cots at all times, the staff member did not disturb the parents and check their name bands,' Mr Grisold said. Both children were wearing the correct ID wrist bands in the overnight settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross check the wristbands and mistakenly brought the Stuhleners someone else's child . 'The second baby remained in the night nursery. 'When it was realised by staff that there was a baby in the incorrect room, the still sleeping baby was instantly removed from that room and returned to its parents. 'At no time was either baby picked up, held or fed by anyone other than their parents.' The hospital has told the distraught parents that Levi remained in the settling room during the 45 minutes period that they were with another infant. However, the Stuhleners are demanding the truth. 'I don't believe that,' Ms Stuhlener told 7News, unable to hold back tears. 'I don't know, was he (Levi) with another mother?' They have become suspicious as St Vincent's Hospital staff allegedly refuse to show the couple the incident report, which details where their baby was throughout the incident. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff . 'That's all we've wanted, to actually see what's written in the incident report and what actually happened,' said Mr Stuhlener. To make matters worse, the hospital's attempt to apologise resulted in another embarrassing mix-up. Mr and Mrs Stuhlener received a letter of apology and $500 worth of vouchers to try and make up for the error. However, the hospital sent them the wrong letter. They received a package addressed to the other couple involved in the mishap – the parents of the infant they mistakenly had in their care for 45 minutes. 'I acknowledge that we made an administration error in sending the wrong correspondence to the wrong family,' Mr Griswold confirmed. The Stuhleners say they've been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised'. The couple insists the incident has had repercussions on their family. Ms Stuhlener says she has had more difficulty bonding with Levi than she did with her firstborn. Their son, now almost three months old, was 'unsettled' for the first several weeks of his life and did not take to breastfeeding. St Vincent's Private Hospital have changed their procedures to try ensure the error is not repeated. Two staff members are now required to cross check both the mother and baby's name tags when moving babies to and from the settling room. The Stuhleners claim to have been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised'","The Stuhleners were handed the wrong baby in a maternity ward mix-up .

"David Cameron’s pledge to crack down on immigration is no longer taken seriously by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Prime Minister had promised to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the General Election. However, last month that vow was shattered when figures showed it had hit a record high. David Cameron’s pledge to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ is no longer taken seriously by the Office for Budget Responsibility . Home Secretary Theresa May later insisted the Tories would restate the failed target to slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they returned to Government. But yesterday the OBR heaped embarrassment on ministers by criticising the prediction. In a document published alongside the Budget, it said its previous forecasts had been ‘underpinned by the assumption’ that net migration – the measure of how many people have come into Britain minus those who have left – would be 105,000 by 2019. Theresa May said Tories would slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they stayed in power . It stated: ‘A reduction over time seems consistent with the international environment and with the Government’s declared efforts to reduce it.’ But in a blow to Mr Cameron, it added: ‘In light of recent evidence, it no longer seems central to assume it will decline so steeply.’ Instead, it said net migration would ‘tend towards 165,000 in the long term’. On taking power in 2010, Mr Cameron pledged to bring the politically-sensitive net migration figure below 100,000. But last month the figure hit 300,000 – fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the EU of 190,000. Downing Street described the figures as a ‘disappointment’ but also a reflection of a growing economy. The highest number previously recorded was 600,000 in September 2010. When Mr Cameron entered Downing Street in May 2010 net migration was running at 244,000. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘David Cameron’s “no ifs, no buts” pledge on net migration is in complete tatters; not even the Office of Budget Responsibility believes the Prime Minister’s promise any more and are now planning for it to be broken. ‘If you needed any more evidence that this government simply can’t be trusted to deliver their promises on immigration, this is it.’","PM promised to reduce net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ by the election .
But vow was shattered when figures last month showed it hit record high .
Theresa May then vowed to cut number to 100,000 if Tories stay in power .
But OBR said net migration would ‘tend towards 165,000 in the long term’"
"Jailed for a year: Gordon Burton (pictured) agreed to say he was behind the wheel when 14 other motorists were caught flouting road regulations . More than a dozen drivers paid one man to accept their points for offences - before police realised what had happened when they saw his licence had 49 points, a court has heard. Gordon Burton, 45, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, agreed to say he was behind the wheel when 14 other motorists were caught speeding, flouting a red light, driving without a seatbelt or using a mobile in the car over a six-year period. Police only became suspicious when it was realised that Burton had 49 penalty points on his licence - the majority of which were not his. Officers noticed that they had received many notices of intended prosecution - sent when a vehicle is seen or photographed committing a driving offence - naming Burton. A huge amount of documentation relating to him between 2006 and 2012 was then reviewed, and the scam was uncovered. Drivers are generally banned from the road when they accrue 12 penalty points. But now, six of the group have been jailed and most of the others given suspended sentences after admitting perverting the course of justice at Newcastle Crown Court. One of them had his sentencing adjourned. The 13 men and one woman include a council worker, retired Royal Navy refrigerator engineer, roofing business owner, scaffolder and director of a construction company. Judge Deborah Sherwin said the seriousness of their actions was evident from the case against politician Chris Huhne,  who tried to cover up swapping speeding points with his ex-wife in 2003. Behind bars: Robert Fish (left), 43, was sent to prison for eight months, while Stephen Grieveson (right), 51, was jailed for six months . Sentenced: Businessman Alan McGreevy (left), 53, was sent to prison for five months, while Alan Russell (right), 27, a director of a construction company, was jailed for ten months . She told the group: ‘People need to realise that offences of this sort may seem easy and victimless, however, they are viewed seriously by the court. I accept their remorse has been demonstrated. ‘I accept they’re isolated incidents, unlikely to be repeated. I also accept that, at the time, it was not appreciated how seriously the court would view this offending. ‘You would come to realise how seriously that court takes matters such as these by press articles into the case of Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce in 2013.’ Anthony Dunnen, prosecuting, said after the 14 drivers were caught breaking road regulations, they got in touch with Burton and he agreed to take their points for them. In court: Hotel manager David Tate (left), 53, was sent to prison for eight months, while William Thirwell (right), 68, got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months . Involved: Kenneth Smith (left), 57, the owner of a roofing business, and bus driver Alan Riddell (right), 27, both got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months . Notices of intended prosecution are sent by the relevant police force to the registered keeper of the vehicle. That person then has to state whether they were driving the vehicle at the time and, if not, who was. The recipient then has to sign, date and return the notice. Council worker: Susan Latimer, 53, was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months . The court heard that, when each of the defendants received their notices of intended prosecution, they named Burton as the driver at the time of the offence. Mr Dunnen added: ‘Police began investigating this matter as a result of a large number of occasions they received a notice of intended prosecution naming Burton and a large quantity of documentation relating to Burton between 2006 and 2012 was then reviewed. ‘Photos taken by speed cameras also showed Burton was not in fact driving some vehicles at the relevant time. There was also one incident where further details emerged from mobile phone exchanges between the defendants Burton, David Tate and Kenneth Walker.’ Mr Dunnen said that one text message, sent by Walker to Tate, in January 2012 said: ‘I need the guy’s full details who is taking the points ASAP, mate. Is he covered with insurance?’ All the mitigating barristers said their clients were all remorseful and were lightly, if at all, convicted. The court heard they all had jobs and had not realised the severity of their actions. Katherine Dunn, for Burton, said he was a chronic alcoholic. She said: ‘He has difficulties with literacy, numeracy and communication. No immediate jail term: Andrew Weeks (left), 30, a plasterer, and retired Royal Navy refrigerator engineer Joseph Hamilton (right), 72, both got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months . Infamous case: The judge said the seriousness of their actions was evident from the case against politician Chris Huhne (pictured), who tried to cover up swapping speeding points with his ex-wife in 2003 . 'He thought many of these defendants were his friends. He is clearly a vulnerable individual who is described by many as having a limited intellectual capacity.’ Scaffolder: Phillip Barnett, 51, was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months . Gordon Burton, 45, was sent to prison for 12 months, while scaffolder Phillip Barnett, 51, was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. Robert Fish, 43, was sent to prison for eight months, Stephen Grieveson, 51, was jailed for six months, and retired Royal Navy refrigerator engineer Joseph Hamilton, 72, got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. Susan Latimer, 53, a council worker, was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. And Robert Dunbar, 52, a plastering business owner, had his sentence adjourned. Businessman Alan McGreevy, 53, was sent to prison for five months, while Alan Russell, 27, a director of a construction company, was jailed for ten months. Kenneth Smith, 57, an owner of a roofing business, was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and hotel manager David Tate, 53, was sent to prison for eight months. William Thirwell, 68, got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and Kenneth Walker, 61, a manager of a property investment company, got a six-month jail term, suspended for 12 months. Andrew Weeks, 30, a plasterer, and bus driver Alan Riddell, 27, both got a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.","Gordon Burton, of Newcastle, said he was behind wheel for 14 motorists .

"Meryl Streep led a chorus of stars honoring the Indian woman whose brutal rape and subsequent death has inspired a documentary so harrowing it has been banned by the Indian government. Streep spoke at the New York City premiere of India's Daughter, a BBC program which tells the story of Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old medical student who was set upon by six rapists as she rode a bus in 2012. Singh was injured so badly after the repeated, violent rapes that she later died in hospital. Indian ministers secured a court order banning the documentary in India, for fear it could stoke public anger. Scroll down for video . Tribute: Meryl Streep, center, spoke at a candlelit vigil before India's Daughter received its U.S. premiere . Streep told a packed auditorium at Baruch College in Gramercy, Manhattan, that Singh is not only India's daughter, but 'our daughter, too'. She was joined by Coldplay singer Chris Martin, Dakota Fanning and Indian actress Frieda Pinto. The documentary was directed by British filmmaker Leslee Udwin, herself a rape victim. The hour-long film, which has aired in Britain already, sparked uproar for including comments from one of Singh's rapists. Mukesh Singh told film crews: 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. Star-studded: Frieda Pinto, left, and Streep, right, were among those at the New York City premiere of the controversial film, which the Indian government has banned . Gathering: Dakota Fanning, left, was at the premiere for the film, which was directed by British filmmaker Leslee Udwin (right) He is one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the medical student, who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in December 2012. Once inside, bus driver Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager launched the attack. The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death. Protests: Thousands of Indians took to the streets after Singh's death in protest at her brutal violation . Outrageous: Mukesh Singh, one of Jyoti Singh's six rapists, told film crews that the rape was her fault . She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines. Her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape. However, Mukesh Singh argued that Jyoti Singh's death was her fault for struggling. He said: 'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent and allow the rape... Then they'd have dropped her off after 'doing her', and only hit [her friend] the boy.' Grief-stricken: Pictured are Badrinath Singh and his wife, Asha Devi, the parents of Jyoti Singh. Badrinath said the documentary shows the 'bitter truth' about Indian culture . He claimed 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two... A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night.' A defense lawyer for the six rapists also weighed in. AP Singh said that if his daughter or sister 'engaged in pre-marital activities... in front of my entire family, I would put petrol on her and set her alight'. The victim's father, Badrinath Singh speaking to broadcaster NDTV, which was set to screen the film before the ban, said the documentary is 'the bitter truth' and deserves to be seen by every Indian.","Streep spoke at premiere of India's Daughter, held in Gramercy, Manhattan .

"A priest is under investigation after allegations he halted his sermon to publicly shame a wheelchair-bound, partially sighted dementia sufferer for rustling her prayer sheet. It is claimed that Father John Lochran, 67, suddenly stopped Mass to rebuke retired psychologist Frances Haler, 87, who also suffers from leukaemia. The congregation at the Roman Catholic church looked on as the priest – who denies the accusation – told the octogenarian: ‘Will you stop rustling!’ A Catholic priest is being investigated after claims he halted his Sunday sermon mid-flow to berate wheelchair-bound Frances Haler (pictured with her granddaughter Alanna) for rustling her prayer sheet . After the service, Mrs Haler’s daughter Toni Bewley said she confronted Father Lochran but he was said to have retorted: ‘It’s my church.’ He is then said to have suggested the elderly lady take communion in her nursing home instead of his church. The incident at St Winefride’s Roman Catholic Church in St Asaph in Denbighshire, is being investigated by the Bishop of Wrexham, the Right Reverend Monsignor Peter Brignall. Last night the pensioner’s family condemned the priest. Mrs Bewley, 60, a college lecturer from Bodelwyddan in North Wales, said: ‘Mum was really quiet throughout the service, and then I got the hymn and prayer book and all the bits of paper. Mum folded the paper in half and held it up close to her eyes. ‘He looked up and said, “Will you stop rustling paper and holding paper up – I’m doing a sermon.” Thankfully, I don’t think Mum realised. ‘I was absolutely livid. At the end of the service I told him he had publicly humiliated my mother. ‘He said he was in the middle of his sermon and he was in flow and it was disturbing him. Mrs Haler's daughter Tony Bewley (right) says she was left feeling 'absolutely livid' at the priest's behaviour towards her mother at St Winefride's Roman Catholic Church (left) in St Asaph in Denbighshire, Wales . Mrs Haler, who has chronic leukaemia and dementia, is pictured left, receiving an award and right, on her wedding day 60 years ago . ‘I have got more Christianity in me than he has in his big toe. I’ve been left very upset. ‘I just can’t see what justification he had to humiliate her in the way he did. It’s so sad, given dwindling congregation numbers, that he could be like this. ‘It’s made me question my faith. There’s no way he can justify such an un-Christian attitude.’ Mrs Bewley said her mother usually enjoyed the services because it helped with her dementia by allowing her to recall long-term memories. But trouble started before this particular service even began, when Father Lochran directed Mrs Haler to sit at the side of the church by the organ – despite her being blind in one eye and partially sighted in another. When Mrs Bewley told him she would not be able to see the Mass, he allegedly responded: ‘This is where she sits, this is my church.’ The incident happened earlier this month when Mrs Haler was attending the Saturday evening Mass in a 29-strong congregation just 200 yards from the nursing home where she lives. Scots-born Father Lochran, who has been at the church for 14 years, said: ‘For many years I was chaplain to pilgrims at Lourdes. I would never speak to someone with dementia like that – and I didn’t on this occasion.’ A Diocese spokesman said: ‘Bishop Peter has no comment to make until the issues have been thoroughly investigated.’ The incident, which is said to have occurred during a Sunday sermon at St Winefride's Roman Catholic Church (pictured) in St Asaph in Denbighshire, north Wales, is being investigated by the Bishop of Wrexham .","Father John Lochran, 67, was saying Mass when he suddenly stopped .
