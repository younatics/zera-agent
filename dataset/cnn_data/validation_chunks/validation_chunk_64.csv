"Raising the legal tobacco age to 21 across America would lower the number of premature deaths by almost 250,000, according to new research. The report, issued by the Institute of Medicine, examined the public health impact of increasing the  age across the US to 19, 21 or 25. And it concluded that if it were to be raised to 21 now, it would result in about 249,000 fewer premature deaths for people born between 2000 and 2019. Raising legal tobacco age could lower the number of premature deaths in America by almost 250,000 . It could mean 45,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer and 4.2million fewer years of life lost for the same generation, the report suggests. While the report does not make any recommendations, officials say, it provides the scientific guidance states and localities need to evaluate policies aimed at reducing and eliminating tobacco use by young people. It also intensifies renewed government efforts to reduce the death and disease caused by tobacco on the heels of the 50th anniversary of the landmark 1964 surgeon general's report that launched the anti-smoking movement. Most states have set the age at 18, which is the federal minimum. Four states - Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey and Utah - have set the age at 19 and several localities, including New York City, have raised the minimum age to 21. Most states have set the legal age for buying tobacco at 18 - the federal minimum. But in some areas you have to be older: . 19: Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey, Utah . 21: Suffolk County; New York City; Evanston, Illinois; Columbia, Missouri; a number of towns in Massachusetts; Englewood, New Jersey and Hawaii County, Hawaii . Increasing the federal age would take an act of Congress, which mandated the report in a 2009 law that gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco. Survey results released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in June showed fewer than 16 percent of the teens smoked a cigarette in the previous month — the lowest level since the government started doing the survey in 1991, when the rate was more than 27 percent. Another CDC study had already put the teen smoking rate below 16 percent, but experts tend to treat this survey's result as the official number. According to Thursday's report, 90 percent of the people who have ever smoked daily first tried a cigarette before 19 years of age and nearly all others tried their first cigarette before the age of 26. If the minimum age were to be raised to 19 today, the report says, there would be about a three percent decrease in smoking prevalence in 2100. Raising the legal age for buying tobacco to 21 could mean 45,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer and 4.2million fewer years of life lost for the same generation, the report suggests . That decrease would rise to 12 percent if it were to be raised to age 21 and 16 percent if it were raised to age 25. There's a 'growing interest' in raising the minimum age to buy tobacco and knowing what the public health implications would be before they act, said the report's committee chair, Richard J. Bonnie, a medicine and law professor and director of the Institute of Law, Psychiatry, and Public Policy at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He added: 'We have reasonable confidence that there will be substantial public health benefits by raise the age.'","Report examined public health impact of increasing age to 19, 21 and 25 .

"A 29-year-old woman who once weighed as little as 39 kilos has revealed how she transformed her figure to become a bodybuilding champion – and why she has refused to give up the gym after becoming pregnant. In her early twenties Marika Magriplis, from Sydney, used to be too small for an Australian dress size six while working in a corporate job and living off a diet of convenience food including noodles and cheap burgers. Today - after overhauling her diet and lifestyle in 2010 - she’s just two weeks from giving birth to her first child and credits exercise and nutrient-rich meals with her 'having nothing to whinge about while pregnant’. ‘I don’t know if I’ve been lucky with my diet and lifestyle but I’ve got away with very minimal side effects with this pregnancy,’ Marika told Daily Mail Australia. Her feet ‘only swelled up once’ and instead of wishing to indulge in sweat treats her only craving has been ‘tuna with vinegar’. Scroll down for video . 'In the last week he has had another spurt... 22 days to go': Marika Magriplis, who is nine months pregnant (left), has credited working out (right) with keeping nasty pregnancy side effects at bay . The 29-year-old, a qualified personal trainer and competitive bodybuilder, ditched her unhealthy lifestyle in 2010 . Since 2012, when she first began competing in bodybuilding competitions around Australia, Marika has spent six days of the week weight training and eating a protein-rich diet. After becoming pregnant she adapted her training, with the help of experts, by reducing her weight sessions each trimester and including more calorie-dense foods into her diet to feed her growing bump. ‘My training became more about core strengthening than building,’ Marika said. ‘Maintaining my strength helped to take the load off. At one stage – about halfway through my pregnancy I had really bad back pain because I made the weights too light - my body needed the strength,’ she explained. However, now with just 14 days until her due date Marika has stopped weight-lifting altogether as she prepares to become a mum. Marika explained that she has kept up weights during pregnancy to maintain strength, not to build muscle like before . Marika's amazing transformation from a tiny 39 kilos to a strong bodybuilder came after she began lifting weights and learning about nutrition . ‘Physically I’ve made peace and listen to my body now and I’ve dropped back on the training side of things. Now it’s a about prenatal yoga and a lot of stretching and preparing the body for birth.’ Marika, who is now a qualified personal trainer, weighed 39 kilos in 2007 after graduating from uni. ‘I was tiny just through lack of knowledge… health wasn’t a priority it was just about making money,’ she explained. When she was competing as a bodybuilder before she was pregnant, Marika's daily diet would include: . Morning . An omelette with two whole eggs and three egg whites with cucumber or broccoli or green beans on the side. 'Its sounds odd for breakfast but it has everything you need, essential fats and fibre  from the veg and protein from the egg whites,' Marika said. Lunch . Fish or chicken, basically a lean white protein, with some salad and some nuts. Snack . Greek yoghurt (around 150 grams) with a handful of nuts and some protein powder. Dinner . White or sweet potato with meat and veg. 'I would have carbs after weight training. It breaks all the rules but if you think about your body as a machine, you need to refuel and  carbs work as energy. 'If you have fats in the morning, keeping them separately for different needs,' Marika explained. Exercise . Marika began weight training six days a week after hiring a coach to get her into shape for competitive bodybuilding. After weights she would have a banana and a protein shake. On day seven Marika would balance weights with a slow walk along the beaches near her home. This was her 'active recovery day'. Marika said one of her favourite core exercises before she was pregnant was 'hanging leg raises'. After she became pregnant with her first child, Marika took advice from her chiropractor, midwife and physio and adapted her workout routine and diet. Morning . Multi-grain bread, oats, or muesli with fruit. Or eggs on toast. Snack . Greek yoghurt and nuts. Or a nut and muesli bar when nauseous. 'I couldn’t even think about eating chicken and greens. The thought of it just made me want to throw up, it was a big adjustment,' Marika said. Lunch . Tuna as well as fresh fruit. Dinner . Similar to before pregnancy. 'I started to think cravings were a myth and I only had indigestion once in my whole pregnancy,' Marika said. 'I also alkalised my body with alkaline greens, that’s really important to help prevent acid reflux. 'Also fish oil capsules have helped with my brain function and baby's developing brain.' Exercise . 'I didn’t really change until the 10 week mark and then I really started to slow down a bit and reduced my weights to four days a week. 'The second trimester I did about three days a week of strength training then a walk or cycle on the other three days just because I felt better being active. 'In the third trimester I have tapered right back to two or three weight sessions a week up until the 36 week mark where I thought ""OK I just cant’ do it any more"". 'I had to find an alternative, with walking and prenatal yoga and walking in the lap pool.' ‘I was in advertising and marketing and worked in the corporate world for a good few years and then decided to transition into a personal trainer because I loved my fitness and wanted to combine my passion with work so I could be happy all the time,’ Marika said. The brunette had always been active and ran cross country at national level at school and struggled to gain weight. 'Maintaining my strength helped to take the load off,' says Marika who has a naturally small frame . Marika explained this photo was taken on 'one of leanest days' of her life while she was competing in bodybuilding . Marika said she has received a lot of criticism online from people who 'aren't educated around the topic' Marika began weight training six days a week after hiring a coach to get her into shape for competitive bodybuilding . ‘I didn’t feel womanly so I sort of talked to a girlfriend and made the move into the gym to get more toned. I felt skinny fat and she said “you just have to do some weights and you won’t be so skinny any more”,’ Marika recalled. Her friend was pregnant while they trained together and Marika was guided by a coach for her move into competitive body building. Her coach, John Davies, taught her to eat high-protein foods and carbohydrates as needed. The knowledge she learned then has helped her through her pregnancy. For example, while feeling nauseous in the first 12 weeks she would snack on a nut or muesli bar to give her strength. As she awaits the arrival of her baby boy, Marika’s midwife told her ‘being fit has helped you’. Marika's partner Luke Schembri is also a competitive bodybuilder. They had these portraits taken ahead of the arrival of their first child . Marika, from Sydney, is happy and healthy ahead of giving birth and feels no pressure to get straight back into competing after giving birth . But the fitness fanatic is not putting any pressure on herself to get back into competing shape any time soon, instead she’s planning to take her time and support her partner Luke Schembri – also a competitive bodybuilder – with his competitions. ‘There is a lot of stress on your body during birth and a lot of nurturing that needs to be done… it’s going to be a milk truck as well,’ she laughed. Marika said she has received a lot of criticism online from people who ‘aren’t educated around the topic and who feel entitled to an opinion’ but emphasised everyone should seek their own professional advice before attempting training. ‘A lot of people won’t know their body as well as I know my body and there were even times when I thought I was doing the right thing and found out I wasn’t,’ she said.","Marika Magriplis's midwife told her 'being fit has helped you'

"A Kurdish peshmerga looks at the body of what they say is an Islamic State militant on the outskirts of Tel Ward, west of the city of Kirkuk after attacking jihadist positions around the oil-rich city . Kurdish forces drove Islamic State militants back from the oil-rich city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq on Monday, in an attack which was backed by heavy air strikes from a U.S.-led coalition. Speaking to a local TV channel near the frontline, Kirkuk governor Najmaldin Karim said the purpose of the offensive was to secure the city, which the Kurds have held since last summer. Peshmerga fighters began shelling Islamic State positions at dawn before advancing along a 20-mile front southwest of the city, seizing several villages and gaining around three miles in places. Monday's gains bring the Peshmerga closer to the ISIS stronghold of Hawijah, where black-clad militants have paraded the bodies of what they said were 20 Shi'ite militiamen they had executed. Speaking by telephone from the frontline near Tel Ward, Major-General Omar Saleh Hassan said: 'This morning we launched an attack on three axes. Our advances are continuing.' He said his forces faced little resistance from Islamic State militants who are also fighting to hold the city of Tikrit around 110 km southwest of Kirkuk, as Iraqi forces close in. Just north of Tikrit, home city of executed Sunni former president Saddam Hussein, Iraqi security forces and Shi'ite militia fighters began an offensive to regain control over the town of al-Alam. Military commanders said some of the attacking force were ferried across from the west bank of the Tigris river, while others were approaching from other directions. 'We have confirmed information from inside Al-Alam that a few Daesh (ISIS) fighters are still inside, mostly suiciders. 'This is why we attacked them from multiple directions in order not to give them time to catch their breath,' Al-Alam mayor Laith al-Jubouri said, referring to the fighters by their Arabic acronym. Jubouri, who has spent time with the attacking forces outside Al-Alam, said clashes were continuing in the south, west and north of the town. In the Kirkuk offensive, elite Kurdish counter-terrorism units were taking part and one official said they had managed to detonate four vehicles rigged with explosives by firing on them from a distance.

Kurdish forces drove Islamic State militants back from the oil-rich city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq on Monday in an attack which was backed by heavy air strikes from a U.S.-led coalition . The Kurds took full control of Kirkuk last August as the Iraqi army collapsed in the north and Islamic State militants overran almost a third of the country. But the city has remained vulnerable, with the frontline no more than 20 kilometres away in some places and only an irrigation canal separating the two sides. In late January, Islamic State briefly overran Kurdish defences around Kirkuk. Revenge is sweet: Kurdish Peshmerga fighters pose for a photo holding an Islamic State flag in the village of Sultan Mari west of the city of Kirkuk after they  re-took the area from the terror group . Kurdish Peshmerga forces walk past a destroyed building belonging to the Islamic State militants, on the outskirts of Tel Ward, west of the city of Kirkuk . Meanwhile, officials said the jihadist group executed 20 people who wanted to fight against them in the northern Iraqi province of Kirkuk. The killings of the men, who wanted to join anti-ISIS paramilitary forces known as Popular Mobilisation units, took place in the town of Hawijah, a police intelligence officer and two local officials said. The executions could not be independently confirmed, but a gruesome series of photos posted online and shared on social media are evidence that they took place.

Kirkuk has remained vulnerable to attack, with the frontline no more than 20 kilometres away in some places and only an irrigation canal separating the two sides . The photos show the bodies of more than a dozen different men strung by their feet from light poles, what appears to be a communications or electricity tower, and under a massive sign featuring the ISIS flag and name. Captions under the photos said the men were members of the Popular Mobilisation units and used a derogatory term that could either refer to the units' Shi'ite leadership, or indicate that the men were believed to be Shi'ites. ISIS spearheaded a sweeping offensive last June that overran large parts of the country north and west of Baghdad, including in Kirkuk province.

"A mother-of-five murdered her newborn baby girl by filling her mouth with toilet paper before hiding her body in a suitcase, a court has heard. Portugese national Claudia Martins, 33, gave birth alone in the bath at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol, having kept the pregnancy a secret for nine months. Bristol Crown Court heard after she allegedly pushed the tissue in the infant's mouth, she wrapped the baby girl in towels and a plastic bag and hid the body in a suitcase - where it was found three days later. Claudia Martins, 33, gave birth alone in the bath at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol, having allegedly kept the pregnancy a secret. She is on trial at Bristol Crown Court (pictured) accused of murdering the baby girl . Paramedics were called to the property after friends and family members found 'a lot of blood' in the bath and Martins was taken to hospital. The court heard Martins repeatedly told hospital staff she had not given birth or been pregnant. During her hospital stay, Martins' sister noticed a smell coming from the suitcase and called police after she opened it and saw blood. Police  found the body of a newborn baby inside a small black suitcase. Martins, who was described as having an extremely low IQ, was arrested and admitted that she had given birth, but said the baby was stillborn. A post-mortem examination found a wad of toilet paper inside the baby's mouth, which experts claim was 'deliberately inserted'. Martins, who denies a single charge of murder on September 12 last year, wept during the opening of her trial at Bristol Crown Court today. Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, said two police officers were called to the flat Martins shared with her sister on September 15 last year. 'They were shown to the bathroom of the flat, where they saw and opened a suitcase,' he said. 'Inside, wrapped in towels and in a black plastic bag, they found the body of a newborn baby girl. Martins was rushed to Bristol Royal Infirmary (pictured) but repeatedly told hospital staff she had not given birth or been pregnant - she was later arrested after her sister discovered the baby's body in a suitcase . 'The baby had been born three days earlier to the defendant, Claudia Martins. 'It is the prosecution's case that she killed the baby as soon as it was born and that she hid the body in the suitcase. 'It is the defence case that she never knew she was pregnant and when she gave birth it was stillborn and that she hid it in the suitcase out of a mixture of shock and panic.' The jury heard Martins is originally from Mozambique but moved to Portugal before settling in Bristol in 2011. She lived in a two-bedroom flat with her sister, Vilma Marshall, Ms Marshall's partner, and five children, which was 'difficult and pressurised', Mr Vaitilingam said. In late 2013 Martins became pregnant and the father of the baby was later identified by DNA analysis as Polish man Jacob Kucmus. 'The baby was full term when born on September 12 2014,' Mr Vaitilingam said. 'We don't know when she first realised, because she never told anyone that she was pregnant nor - as far as we are able to say - consulted with a doctor.' Friends and family suspected that Martins was pregnant but she denied this and refused to go to a doctor, it is alleged. Martins' sister, Vilma, was pregnant with a baby girl at the same time and gave birth a week before Martins did. A naming ceremony was held at the flat on September 12 but Martins went upstairs to the bathroom at 7pm complaining of a bad back. Friends at the party later went to check on Martins and found her bleeding, with 'a lot of blood' in the bath, Mr Vaitilingam said. They called an ambulance and paramedics arrived at 8.54 to find Martins in a sarong, with a 'heavily bloodstained towel' between her legs. The paramedics persuaded Martins to leave with them at 10.40pm and headed to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. 'Before she left, Claudia went to a suitcase that was in the far corner of the room and rummaged around in it,' Mr Vaitilingam told the court. 'It looked to the paramedics as though she was rearranging items within the suitcase, and she then shut it and placed items on top of it before leaving with them for the hospital.' Dr Russell Delaney carried out a post-mortem examination and found the baby was normally formed, with no evidence of disease to account for death. Due to the level of decomposition, medical experts are unable to determine whether the baby was born dead or alive. But Dr Delaney found a wad of five pieces of wet tissue paper - the same as on a toilet roll in the bathroom. Mr Vaitilingam tol the court the paper had been 'deliberately inserted' into the baby's mouth. 'The prosecution's case is that Claudia Martins put this wad of tissue paper into the child's mouth after it had been born, intending to cause its death and achieving exactly that,' Mr Vaitilingam said. 'She denies that, but has never offered any explanation as to how that object came to be placed in the baby's mouth.' The trial continues.

"Customers who couldn't 'Say Cheese' in a broken photo booth during a birthday party at an Ohio Chuck E. Cheese's brutally attacked employees at the place 'Where A Kid Can Be A Kid.' During the incident on Sunday night in the Cleveland suburb of Parma, five men began to attack because one of them felt the manager didn't respond quickly enough to a complaint about the booth. Six employees (including the manager) were injured in the attack and brought to the hospital. Scroll down for video . Customers at a Chuck E. Cheese's in Ohio attacked six employees after a photo booth wouldn't work . At least five men carried out the attack while a dozen members of the birthday party they were at cheered .

"White House hopeful Ted Cruz says he's already received more than $1 million in donations since his Tuesday announcement that he would run for president. The Republican lawmaker made the disclosure during a Tuesday evening interview with Fox News host Megyn Kelly after she read aloud several not-so-rave reviews of his candidacy. 'If you want a quick indication of the support we're seeing - the incredible grassroots support - it's been 36 hours since we launched the campaign. In the first day, over 140,000 people have come to our website TedCruz.org,' the Texas senator said. 'In the first day we've raised over $1 million,' he continued. 'In one day.' Scroll down for video . 'If you want a quick indication of the support we're seeing - the incredible grassroots support - it's been 36 hours since we launched the campaign. In the first day, over 140,000 people have come to our website TedCruz.org,' he said. The Republican lawmaker made the disclosure during a Tuesday evening interview with Fox News host Megyn Kelly after she read aloud several not-so-rave reviews of his candidacy . A Politico report from Tuesday that said the freshman senator had raised just $500,000 was using an outdated number, Cruz contended, and the amount of  money his campaign has raised now tops $1 million. Noting that he's not the favorite candidate of lobbyists in Washington, D.C. and 'crony capitalists,' Cruz said the ground swell was coming from grassroots supporters. 'Our campaign is based on courageous conservatives across this country, men and women goin' to TedCruz.org and contributing. And that's where we're getting the support,' he told Kelly. Cruz formally announced his entry into the 2016 contest for White House on Monday morning before a crowd of 10,000 at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. In making himself an official candidate for higher office Cruz also made himself a target for criticisms from the media and fellow competitors for the Republican nomination, namely Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Paul, who plans to make his own announcement in less than two weeks on April 7, insinuated in a Monday interview with Kelly that Cruz is too divisive to attract the kind of support the GOP needs to claim victory in the 2016 general election. The freshman lawmaker argued in plain terms that Tea Party Republicans would be better off selecting him as the party's nominee over Cruz and other conservatives because unlike them he's earned the respect of minorities and other urban community dwellers. Cruz said Tuesday during an early-morning appearance on the Today show that he was confident in his ability to put back together the broad national coalition of women, young people and moderate Democrats that swept Ronald Reagan into power in 1980. He hammered his point home to Kelly during his Tuesday evening appearance on his Fox News program, The Kelly File. 'I like Rand Paul, he's a friend of mine, I respect him, we fought side by side for liberty, we'll keep fighting side by side for liberty,' he said of his colleague, before shifting gears and explaining that in running for statewide office 'we reassembled the Reagan coalition' and that was how he won his 2012 Senate race.

Cruz's daughter Caroline, 6, center, high-fives members of the crowd after he father's speech. Also pictured is Catherine Cruz, 4, left . Cruz also sought during the interview to put some daylight between his background and that of President Barack Obama, elected to the Oval Office after spending just two years in the Senate. In addition to their limited experience with federal lawmaking, both men are Harvard educated lawyers. Arguing that there are 'marked differences' between he and the current president, including the fact that he served as his state's chief lawyer and successfully argued cases before the Supreme Court before running for and being elected to the federal legislature. Obama worked as a community organizer, he said, ignoring the former Illinois lawmaker's time as a state senator preceding his time as U.S. Senator. Furthermore, Cruz claimed that Obama was a backbencher in the Senate, whereas he has been a leading voice on issues of national importance. 'In my time in the Senate, there were a lot of faults I have, but nobody would accuse me of being a backbencher,' the outspoken conservative legislator said. As for the fruits of his labor, Cruz said, 'What we’ve accomplished over and over again, in many instances, is stopping bad things from happening.' He pointed to legislation introduced in the Senate in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting and said, 'I did everything I could to energize and mobilize the grassroots to stand up and protect the Second Amendment. 'And every single proposal of Barack Obama to undermine the Second Amendment was voted down on the Senate floor,' he stated. Asked 'what do you like best about yourself that makes you think you could hold this job, Cruz's answer was simple: 'I love the Constitution, and I am fighting for freedom.' 'I wake up every day, I jump out of bed, I cannot tell you how thrilled I am, because this country is in crisis, and what an incredible privilege to be in the arena,' he told her.","In the first day, over 140,000 people have come to our website TedCruz.org.

"Nestled in the Somerset countryside and protected by soundproof fencing, neighbours say it looks like a holiday park. But this £1.6million caravan site has been built by a council to provide a permanent home for just eight traveller families. The facility, Carrswood View, is on the site of a previous unauthorised and run-down camp near Bath. Bath's first permanent gipsy camp, which cost £1.6million to build, is due to open next month and contains eight permanent pitches . The site contains eight permanent pitches and five which are designated 'transit' sites for people who are just passing through the area . Each of the pitches have been built to house a utility unit, which contains washing facilities (left) and space for furniture (right) Retired engineer Michael Parr, 69, said: ‘It’s a lot of money to lavish on people who travel around. It’s like a holiday camp.’ Another local said: ‘Don’t think I’ll bother paying to go to Center Parcs or Butlins any more!’ The site has five ‘transit’ pitches for short stays and eight permanent plots with a living room, sanitary facilities, a patio and parking for two caravans and two cars. Because it is in the green belt, the units are clad in wood with grass roofs so they blend in. Soundproof fencing will cut down noise from a nearby road and railway. The build, by Elim Housing, cost £1.62million – with £870,000 of council cash and £750,000 from central government. Allan Perrin, 64, has lived nearby for 25 years. He said: ‘It is a vast improvement but the question is could it have been done cheaper?’ Carrswood View has been developed on the site of an illegal encampment in Bath which had become run-down and full of rubbish . The illegal site was full of discarded rubbish and gas canisters, and councillors hope the new development will give them more control . Each utility unit has been built in wood and have a roof which will be covered in grass to minimise the impact of the green belt development . Tim Warren, of the opposition Tory group on Bath and North East Somerset Council, said: ‘It’s absolutely beautiful, however, is this the best use of taxpayers’ money? I’m also not convinced this is the final figure. When we first had meetings around this, costs were estimated at over £2million.’ Gypsy Council chairman Joseph P Jones said it was a lot to spend – and it would have been cheaper to let the travellers build their own housing. He said: ‘The majority of new provision comes from the gipsy and traveller community itself, and because it is built by us and owned by us, it costs the council nothing and is generally better looked after.’ Residents of Carrswood View will pay £105 a week rent and £963.40 a year council tax, with 11 applicants hoping to move in next month. Council leader Paul Crossley said having a dedicated gipsy site made it easier to clear illegal camps. The council is in the process of making £30million of cuts over three years. The utility unit for each pitch contains sinks, electricity points and running water, as well as room for kitchen equipment to be installed . Finishing touches are being made to fences and driveways for each of the pitches, to give the maximum possible facilities for families . Developers have been making the final finishing touches to the site, which is expected to open officially next month .","New site for travellers, containing eight permanent and five 'transit' pitches, is due to open in Bath next month .
Carrswood View is the most expensive travellers' site to be built in Britain - the next most costly came in at £1.3m .

"A schoolboy has admitted burning a Union Flag in the heart of an English village with a friend whose former punk rocker mother fled to Syria to be with her ISIS toy-boy. The 14-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with arson after the flag was torn down from its pole and burned with a lighter weeks before Remembrance Sunday. The flag was then spat and urinated on during the incident in Borough Green, near Sevenoaks, Kent, in October 2014. 'Horrible': The 14-year-old admitted playing a part in the burning of this flag, alongside the son of jihadi bride Sally Jones, in the Kent village of Borough Green last October . The schoolboy appeared at youth court in Sevenoaks, Kent on Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to arson, supported by his mother and friend Jonathan Wilkinson . The 18-year-old - the son of jihadi bride Sally Jones - had already accepted a formal police caution for his part in the despicable act, along with another 14-year-old boy. The trio were caught on CCTV cameras climbing on each other's shoulders and tearing the Union Flag from its pole on October 27 - just weeks before Remembrance Sunday. The incident happened just months after it was revealed Wilkinson's 47-year-old mother, a former member of a punk rock band from Chatham, Kent, had travelled to Raqqa in Syria with her younger son to marry Islamic State fighter Junaid Hussain, 20, from Birmingham, who skipped bail to fight in Syria. It has since come out that Jones has been actively recruiting potential brides for other fighters, while in December she tweeted: 'May Allah destroy all those that cross us.' Punk rocker: Jones, a life-long benefits claimant, converted to Islam and fled the UK last year . Prosecuting, Paul Edwards told the hearing the flag was pulled from its pole before being burned, spat on and urinated over. The 14-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, arrived at court with his mum, and friend Wilkinson. 'I don't know why we did it to be honest,' the 14-year-old told the court. 'I didn't know they were going to burn it, I just thought they were going to take it down. 'I wanted to go but I also wanted to stay. 'I did hold them up to help but I didn't do any of the spitting or anything.' Twitter: Jones met her husband through the micro-blogging site, and remains an active user . Left behind: The 18-year-old's mother took her youngest son to Syria, but left her oldest at home . The defendant's mum told the court her son 'was in the wrong place at the wrong time'. She said: 'Jon, the other party, is here today to tell everyone that he did it and it was his idea. 'My son was there when he shouldn't have been but he didn't do it. 'He's a loving boy.' Defending, Sasha Queffurus said: 'He felt embarrassed when he didn't get involved because the others were telling him not to be uncool. 'But he knows he should have just gone home and he knows it was wrong. 'He wants to pay for the damage.' Sentencing, chairman of the bench Nigel Cox  said: 'It is a bit horrible. 'You might not like the Union Flag but it is for our protection and our benefit.' Tweets: The mother-of-two married convicted hacker Junaid Hussain before travelling to the Middle East last year, and has since used her social media presence to encourage more girls to become jihadi brides . The 14-year-old will be supervised by the Youth Offenders team over this period and his parents were ordered to pay costs of £250 to the CPS, a victim surcharge of £15 and a third of the flag's damages at £16.66. The flag was found the day after the incident by local councillor Mike Taylor. Speaking at the time he said: 'Borough Green is proud of being British, and celebrates that by flying two Union Flags in the village, at the library and the crossroads. 'As a youth worker for many years I am largely immune to the occasional stupidity and vandalism perpetrated by young people, it's usually thoughtless high spirits aggravated by lager or pot, but I witnessed an act that chilled me. 'Because there appear to be no other instances of vandalism, perhaps this was a deliberate political statement. 'But that flag was a constant reminder of the sacrifices of many.'","Boy tells court he doesn't know why he took part in October 2014 burning .

"As part of a class assignment, inmates at California's oldest prison were tasked with writing their own obituaries - and the results were as startling as they were moving. The idea was that of UC Berkely journalism professor William Drummond, who teaches a news writing class at San Quentin State Prison, just north of San Francisco. 'I did it as a way to find out how these guys had reconciled their crimes,' Drummond told The Los Angeles Times. 'Were they able to take a critical look at what got them in trouble?' Penning his ending: Convicted  murderer Phoeun You sits against a fence in the exercise yard at San Quentin State Prison in California. He is one of several inmateswho wrote his own obituary for a class project . Repenting: You wrote in his obituary that, after killing someone, he would like save someone before he dies . Cambodian refugee Phoeun You came to America when he was five-years-old. As a teenager he fell into the wrong crowd, blaming cultural differences, and soon joined an Asian gang. When he was about 20, You got into a fight outside a high school with a member of a Latino gang. Reeling from the fight, You went and got a gun, and set about trying to find his rivals from the fight. Failing that, he opened fire at a random person on the street. 'It was just a guy who looked like a gang member,' You told The Times. 'He was close enough.' He killed the 17-year-old boy, and bystanders were hit by bullets as well. You was convicted of murder and attempted murder in 1996 and could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Professor Drummond told the inmates they could make up anything they wanted for their obituary and gave them free creative reign. Most importantly they had to figure out how they would die. You wrote a story about a riot breaking out in San Quentin and how he saves the life of a teacher by stepping in front of a knife. He is stabbed to death by another inmate. You said, having killed someone himself, you would like to one day save someone. 'My incarceration, the reason I'm here, is by taking a life. When I leave this world, I would love to leave saving a life,' he said. Reflective: San Quentin inmate Julian Glenn Padgett, also a convicted murderer, made no mention of his crimes, instead writing that he is killed in an earthquake . Julian Glenn Padgett is serving 31 years to life for first-degree murder, arson, burglary and grand theft. A charismatic and expressive Ethiopian Jew, Padgett has discovered a love for acting while behind bars, and has appeared in a prison production of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. His obituary makes no reference of his crimes. He paints a story of himself of being outdoorsy and enjoying camping and mountain climbing trips with his friend. Padgett died 'as a result of a massive earthquake that struck San Quentin State Prison', his obituary said. 'Earthquakes are memorable. They're forces of nature,' Padgett told The Times. 'To take me out, it would take something like that.' Emotional: Troy 'Kogen' Williams is serving a 70-years-to-life sentence for armed robbery, carjacking and false imprisonment at San Quentin State Prison . Juan Haines, who is serving 55 years for a string of bank robberies, also did not mention his crimes. He skips over his death in the obituary, saying he was found dead in his cell on his 55th birthday from natural causes. But he goes on to reminisce about his childhood and the stages in his life that were positive - where things could have been different. Haines includes his piece 'quotes' from a classmate about how proactive a student he was in San Diego, including being class president. 'He built the treasury from just a couple of dollars, to several thousand,' the quote said. 'His biggest accomplishment was at Homecoming, our float was the biggest one, and our Junior Class Ball was held at a big fancy hotel. The seniors were somewhat jealous.' Haines later told The Times that he was thinking about the time when he was 'on track'. 'Once I got derailed, that was it,' he said.

"Christians are frightened to reveal their religious beliefs to colleagues at work, equality chiefs admit. When they do declare their Christianity, whether in the office or on the shop floor, they are often mocked or treated like bigots – and their children are even ridiculed at school. Christians also think their faith is being pushed out of its role as a cornerstone of life in Britain, according to a major study by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. And ironically, many feel they are being persecuted by the same anti-discrimination and equality laws supported by the equality watchdog. Persecuted: The study of 2,500 people found many of the Christians who took part felt they needed to hide their faith at work or at school, for fear of being called bigots or being mocked . Nearly 2,500 people of all faiths were quizzed about religion at work for the nationwide study. It follows years of conflict over Christians’ right to act in accordance with their religious beliefs. A series of high-profile court battles have left many feeling that the law is tilted against them and that gay rights trump their own. Many of the major test cases have been backed by the equality commission itself, including the successful Supreme Court case brought by a gay couple against hoteliers Peter and Hazelmary Bull, who declined to rent them a room because they were not married. The commission is currently backing a legal claim against a Belfast-based Christian-run bakery that wouldn’t bake a cake bearing a slogan that supported gay marriage. Of those who responded to the commission’s survey, 1,030 said they were Christian. The next largest group –188 – were atheist. People of other faiths made up the rest. The commission’s report said: ‘A recurring theme among some employees was the pressure they felt they were under to keep their religion hidden at work and feeling discriminated against when it came to wearing religious symbols or expressing their beliefs. This was particularly felt by Christians. ‘People reported being mocked for their beliefs, including Christians, who said their colleagues assumed they were bigoted. Some Christian-run services or businesses said they felt in turmoil about behaving in ways that they feared might breach the Equality Act 2010, which protects people from discrimination in the workplace and in access to goods and services.’ There were also protests from some humanists and atheists, the report said, including complaints there were no humanist chaplains at hospitals. Several atheists felt left out if they worked for companies that staged events in churches. Commission chief executive Mark Hammond said of the survey: ‘What came out strongly was the widespread confusion about the law, leading to some resentment and tensions between groups, and anxiety for employers who fear falling foul of what they see as complicated equality and human rights legislation.’ He said that the commission would produce new guidance to ‘help everyone address some of the issues’. Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute – a think tank that has supported opponents of the commission in court – said: ‘It is a relief that the commission is beginning to realise there is a problem.’ But he added: ‘It would help if it admitted that it may have been part of the problem. In many cases the commission has aggressively promoted cases against innocent Christians like Peter and Hazelmary Bull. ‘There was an appalling case a few years ago when a commission lawyer referred to the spread of Christian views using the word “infected”. It is going to have to do an awful lot of work to rebuild confidence among Christians and persuade them that it does not regard secularism as the solution to all problems.’","Study claims Christians feel under pressure to hide faith at work .

"Cissy Houston has broken her silence on the condition of her comatose granddaughter Bobbi Kristina to reveal the 21-year-old is not showing any signs of improvement. Despite having been transferred last week to a Georgia rehabilitation facility, Whitney Houston's 81-year-old mother told New York's WBLS radio that little has changed in Bobbi Kristina's condition. 'She's the same,' Cissy said. 'We've moved her to a place for rehabilitation. And you know, still not a great deal of hope.' Not much hope: Cissy Houston has broken her silence on the condition of her comatose granddaughter Bobbi Kristina to reveal the 21-year-old is not showing any signs of improvement . 'She's the same,' Cissy said. 'We've moved her to a place for rehabilitation. And you know, still not a great deal of hope.' Moved: Brown, the daughter of late pop singer Whitney Houston, was moved to a rehabilitation facility from a Georgia hospital almost two months after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub . 'The family had for weeks stayed mostly mum about Bobbi's condition Houston also took the time to thank fans who'd been praying for Bobbi since she was found unresponsive in a bathtub of her Georgia home January 31. 'I feel every bit of it,' she said. 'I truly do.' Houston said: 'I'm asking everybody: ""Just pray to the Lord who we know CAN do something about it.""' Brown, the daughter of late pop singer Whitney Houston, was moved to a rehabilitation facility from a Georgia hospital almost two months after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub, NBC News reported on last week. Family members, including Bobby's son Landon and Whitney's sister-in-law Pat Houston, lent their support during the transfer, with Pat seen carrying items including stuffed toys and books. Doctors at Emory attempted to slowly remove life support to see if Bobbi responded but unfortunately it was to no avail and sources have confirmed she is in the same non-responsive state she's been in for weeks. The new facility is said to be better for long-term care. Bobby reportedly remains confident that his daughter can come out of the coma even though doctors have told the family to prepare for the worst. Bobbi was taken to North Fulton Hospital in Roswell, Georgia after being resuscitated on January 31 and was later transferred to Emory Hospital where she had been until this week. Meanwhile, according to Radar Online, R&B star Bobby 'wants god to make the decision' of whether to take his daughter off life support and is 'devastated' that he is going to have to make this decision about his child.

"She has written the women's manifesto for success in the boardroom. Now Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is giving relationship advice so couples can also triumph in the bedroom. In an ongoing series for the New York Times called Women at Work, the social media executive, 45, has suggested engaging in 'choreplay' leads to more sex. Facebook's Chief Operating Officer and mother-of-two Sheryl Sandberg (left and right) believes sharing chores, or 'choreplay', leads to more sex . This doesn't include romantic evenings out or luxury holidays - but simply sharing the duties around the house. The basis of the argument is from a 2009 study by Constance T. Gager and Scott T. Yabiku, which measured The Relationship Between Household Labor Time and Sexual Frequency. Using the results, Sandberg and co-writer Adam Grany suggest: 'Men and women who work hard [together] play hard.' Sandberg suggested that if if a man wanted to do something nice - instead of buying flowers they should do the laundry. The piece continues by saying: 'A man who heard this was asked by his wife one night to do a load of laundry. He picked up the basket and asked hopefully, 'Is this Lean In (reffering to her latest book) laundry?' Choreplay is real.' Citing research from 2000, the pair add 'that when men do their share of chores, their partners are happier and less depressed, conflicts are fewer, and divorce rates are lower.' They also suggest children who spend more time being cared for by their fathers are happier, healthier and less likely to have behavioral problems. For men, being in the company of their young ones make them more patient, emphatic and less likely to drink or do drugs. In 2012 mother-of-two Sandberg was made Facebook's first female board member.

"A third attacker is still on the run after the massacre at Tunisia's Bardo museum which left 23 dead, the country's president has said. President Beji Caid Essebsi said the attack involved 'three aggressors' and the third man escaped, in an interview broadcast on French television. He was speaking live with French network iTele from inside the museum where extremists killed 21 people. Scroll down for video . A third attacker is still on the run after the deadly assault on Tunisia's Bardo museum, the country's president Beji Caid Essebsi has said . The news comes after a video was released of the pair roaming the Bardo, and appearing to 'let go' a visitor . The two attackers encounter a man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs in the museum - but let the visitor escape with his life before carrying out the deadly attack . he man in the backpack scuttles off as the two armed men prepare to carry out the chilling attack . Suspects have been arrested over the attack but it was previously believed just two gunmen launched the attack on the museum. The news comes after a video was released of the pair roaming the Bardo. The one-minute video posted on the government's Interior Ministry Facebook page shows the two men scurrying through the Tunis museum, carrying assault rifles and bags. One of the attackers is wearing a baseball cap and a heavy jacket, while the other wears a red hooded jumper and tracksuit pants. At one point, they encounter another man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs. They briefly acknowledge each other and let the unidentified man walk free before unleashing the deadly attack in the country's largest museum. The video also shows stills of the dead gunmen - named as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaou - who were killed in a firefight with security forces, including a picture indicating at least one was wearing an explosive belt. Hostages flee the museum during the Tunisian special forces raid which ended in the death of both gunmen . The government now plans to deploy the army to major cities to bolster security following the shootings - here policeman stand outside the Carthage International Airport in Tunis . Police responding to the attack shot and killed the two gunmen. They were identified as Tunisians in their 20s who had trained in Libya. Essebsi said the extremists who have recruited about 3,000 Tunisians to fight in Iraq and Syria have no credible connection to Islamic belief. He said his country was at war with them. 'When war is brought upon us, we will wage war,' he said. ISIS claimed Wednesday's attack on foreign tourists in Tunis, the deadliest involving foreigners in Tunisia since a 2002 suicide bombing on the island of Djerba. Tunisian fighters make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to ISIS in Syria, with as many as 10,000 having signed up. Shattered: The walls and windows were peppered with bullet holes while unused grenades lay scattered among debris . The government said the two gunmen had trained in jihadi camps in Libya before the attack inside the heavily secured Tunisian parliament compound. Among the 23 dead in Wednesday's attack, 17 were cruise ship tourists, including British mother-of-two Sally Adey. They also included a Tunisian policeman. Mrs Adey, 57, from Shropshire, had been on a cruise of the Mediterranean with her husband, Robert, and was on an excursion to the museum. Police in Tunisia have arrested five people described as directly tied to the two gunmen. Four others said to be supporters of the cell were also arrested in central Tunisia, not far from where a group claiming allegiance to al Qaida's North African branch has been active. ISIS issued a statement and audio on jihadi websites applauding the dead gunmen as 'knights' for their 'blessed invasion of one of the dens of infidels and vice in Muslim Tunisia'. As investigations into the massacre continue, Tunisian security officials have been asked why the world-famous museum was completely unprotected. The government now plans to deploy the army to major cities to bolster security following the shootings.","President Beji Caid Essebsi said the attack involved 'three aggressors'

"Police in Oregon have seized almost 14 pounds of heroin that was hidden inside a car's frame rails worth $650,000. Jesus Alejandro Vega-Cazarez, 19, and Jose Luis Mariscal Gonzalez, 42, were arrested last week following a three-month investigation into suspected drug trafficking. A surveillance team spotted the pair meeting up at a garage in Vancouver, Washington, for an alleged drug swap. When they were caught, officers searched their vehicles and recovered 13.8lb of the drug - enough to provide around 1,251,914 individual doses - and $90,000 in cash. Stashed: Jesus Alejandro Vega-Cazarez, 19, and Jose Luis Mariscal Gonzalez, 42, were arrested after officers from Portland, Oregon, police found 13.8lb of heroin worth $650,000 inside the frame of a car . The substance was stashed in black tubes and was attached to green string. On March 19, officers from the Portland Police Bureau Drugs and Vice Division saw two vehicles arriving at the location in Vancouver. They watched as the men carried unknown items into a garage, closed the door and then left in different directions a few minutes later. Following the alleged drug drop, police tracked down the two vehicles a short time later and searched them. A statement from Portland Police read: 'Investigators were conducting surveillance and observed the occupants of two vehicles meet up in Vancouver Washington. Investigators observed the occupants carry items into a garage and close the door. A short time later the parties exited the garage and went in different directions. 'Investigators, with the assistance of officers with the Vancouver (WA) Police Department, eventually contacted both vehicles and detained the occupants at Southeast Mill Plain Boulevard and 160th Avenue. Seized: Officers also seized $90,000 in cash from inside one of the vehicles. They were stopped following an alleged drugs swap in Vancouver, Washington . 'Approximately $90,000 was seized from one vehicle and 13.8 pounds of heroin was seized from the frame rails of the other vehicle. Four individuals were detained and two were eventually lodged in the Clark County (WA) Jail on drug-related charges. 'Investigators later served search warrants on two residences in Oregon associated to the suspects. 'The 13.8 pounds of heroin is estimated to be worth $650,000 (wholesale) and translates to approximately 1,251,914 individual doses.","Jesus Alejandro Vega-Cazarez, 19, and Jose Luis Mariscal Gonzalez, 42 were arrested following a three-month operation by Portland, Oregon, Police .

"A woman who fled with her son while fighting to prevent his circumcision will face imprisonment if she doesn't return and allow the surgery to proceed, a judge ruled Friday. In a stinging rebuke of the mother, Heather Hironimus, Circuit Judge Jeffrey Gillen said she had successfully dragged out a legal battle and was 'reprehensible' for going missing with the boy and for conduct that has put the 4-year-old in a public spotlight 'making him an object of curiosity and worse'. He found her in contempt and demanded she appear in court on Tuesday with the child or he would command police to find her. Circuit Judge Jeffrey Gillen said on Friday that Heather Hironimus could escape jail if she appears before him on Tuesday with the child . She will only avoid jail on the contempt charge, Gillen said, if she signs paperwork necessary to schedule the procedure that she initially agreed to in a legal document. 'This child has been placed in a light that provides much too much scrutiny for a little boy,' the judge said. 'I blame no one but the mother for that.' It was the latest dramatic turn in a case nearly as old as the boy himself, and one that has become a rallying cry for 'intactivists,' the circumcision opponents who say removing the foreskin is barbaric. Though Hironimus gave her blessing to circumcision in the parenting plan she reached with the boy's father, Dennis Nebus of Boca Raton, she later changed her mind, leading to a long court battle. Circuit and appellate judges have sided with the father. The father has called circumcision 'just the normal thing to do.' The mother said it's not worth the risks. After Hironimus, of Boynton Beach, refused to sign papers to allow the circumcision and after protesters spotlighted the case, potential surgeons have backed out of circumcising the boy. Both Nebus and the boy's doctors have received death threats. Meantime, the mother has stoked the protests and publicity, despite a court order not to, said May Cain, an attorney for the father, who appeared in court. 'She's willing to flee with him and plaster him all over the Internet and do anything she can,' Nebus said. 'She's stated that she's going to do everything that she can to stop it.' Nebus said he has not seen his son since Feb. 19. Thomas Hunker, the attorney for Hironimus, said he did not know where his client was. After the hearing, Hunker said 'We're concerned for the child's wellbeing and emotional condition.' Though circumcision rates have fallen in the U.S., a majority of boys still undergo the procedure, though a bubbling movement against it has developed. The CDC says medical evidence shows benefits clearly outweigh risks, and that circumcision can lower a male's risk of sexually transmitted diseases, penile cancer and urinary tract infections. Protesters in December in Florida, who are known as 'intactivists' have made the four-year-old's case their cause celebre and organized a series of protests .","Heather Hironimus could escape jail if she appears before a judge on Tuesday with the child .

"A survivor of the Columbine High School massacre lost his state football championship ring a decade ago and had it returned to him by a homeless veteran in California. Evan Todd, 31, who was the first person shot in the library during the April 20, 1999 shooting spree in Colorado, lost the ring while on a speaking tour in California in 2003 or 2004. Todd originally received the ring after his football team won the 1999 state championship just months after the shootings, which left 12 students and a teacher dead - before the two teenage gunmen killed themselves, according to the Denver Post. Bobby Smith, 60, a homeless veteran returned the ring engraved with Todd's name last week after finding it among stones in a creek in San Luis Obispo, California while searching for arrowheads. Evan Todd (left), 31, who was the first student shot in the library during the April 20, 1999 shooting spree in Colorado, lost the ring while on a speaking tour in California in 2003 or 2004. Bobby Smith (right), 60, a homeless veteran returned the ring engraved with Todd's name last week after finding it among stones in a creek in San Luis Obispo, California while he was looking for arrowheads . Smith (above with the ring) was a Vietnam War veteran and was also living in a homeless shelter in San Luis Obispo when he tracked Todd down through Columbine High School. He called Todd last month to tell him he found the ring, which he took to a couple of sports shops to have it authenticated . He said when he saw it, he instantly recognized the name of the high school and knew it was a special ring. Todd, a starter on the 1999 team that won the Class 5A state championship, was shot in the back by one of the gunmen before he was hit in the face with shrapnel during the massacre. The shooting, at the time, was named the worst in the history of the American school system. Smith, a Vietnam War veteran, was living in a homeless shelter in San Luis Obispo when he tracked down Todd after contacting his old football coach, Andy Lowry, at the high school, according to The Blaze. He called Todd last month to tell him he found the ring, which he took to a couple of sports shops to have it authenticated. Todd said he was thrilled to have the ring back, which he said he would have over a Super Bowl ring (pictured above) any day . One shop owner offered him $2,000 for the ring while another suggested they sell it on eBay and split the profits. Smith, who met Todd for the first time on Fox and Friends last Thursday in New York, said he told one shop owner: 'Yes, I'd like to take the money, but no, I can't, because it wouldn't be the right thing to do, because if it was my ring, I would certainly want it back.' Todd said he was thrilled to have the ring back, which he said he would have over a Super Bowl ring any day. 'We went through so much together as a team and community. The ups and downs, the adversity, the microscope we were under,' he said. 'Those challenges were unlike any other that we had to deal with. It was a magical season for sure. But that ring had all of those emotions tied up in it,' added Todd. Todd has since set up a GoFundMe page and said half of the proceeds will go to Smith and the rest will be given to other homeless veterans. Todd, a starter on the 1999 team who won the Class 5A crown, was shot in the back by one of the gunmen before he was hit in the face with shrapnel during the April 1999 massacre - named the worst shooting in the history of the American school system at the time (above SWAT policemen arrive at the high school in Littleton following the shootout) 'It's a simple act of doing the right thing, nothing really special. You never know what you'll do in life. You learn a lot about yourself. I'm just glad he got it back,' said Smith. On Monday evening, the fund had raked in $104,000 in donations. However, Smith said he has to figure out whether he would lose any veterans benefits before he could accept donations. 'I'm not asking for anything. I just wanted to do the right thing,' said Smith. 'I'm blessed. God works in mysterious ways.' Columbine High School Massacre, April 20, 1999: 13 victims dead, 21 injured . On the morning of Tuesday, April 20 in 1999 two students from Columbine High School, in Colorado, carried out a shooting spree in which they shot dead 13 people and injured another 21. The highly organised attack was carried out by senior students Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17. The two, armed with an arsenal of guns and explosives, stalked the school campus firing indiscriminately at teachers and students. The highly organised attack was carried out by senior students Eric Harris (left), 18, and Dylan Klebold (right), 17. The two, armed with an arsenal of guns and explosives, stalked the school campus firing indiscriminately at teachers and students . The shooting lasted just under one hour. Although police had responded, the two shooters are thought to have committed suicide simultaneously by shooting themselves. Because the two killed themselves there remained a wide range of speculation about their motivation. The killers' interests of music and video games was scrutinized, as were concerns the two had been victims of bullies and were suffering from mental health issues. It also sparked an intense public debate on the issue of gun control in the U.S. with campaigners calling for stronger gun control measures. The crime has become one of the most notorious shootings in modern U.S. history. At the time it was considered one of the country's worst in terms of total death toll - but this has been surpassed by more heinous shootings in recent years. It was also the subject of a 2002 Michael Moore documentary - in which the director explored the context of the massacre with regards to U.S. gun control laws and violence in society.

"Deputy PM Nick Clegg making Cornish pasties during a visit to St Merryn school in north Cornwall . Nick Clegg yesterday handed over £150,000 of public money to promote a language barely anyone speaks. The Lib Dem leader’s generosity to the handful of Cornish speakers is the latest in a series of extraordinary gestures to the county over recent months. Yesterday’s handout brings Coalition spending on attempts to revive Cornish to £500,000 – enough to give nearly £900 to every person who speaks it. The Deputy Prime Minister’s interest in Cornish provoked cynicism among opponents, who pointed to his party’s lowly status in the polls. It comes a week after the party announced a drop in fuel prices that mainly benefits areas full of Lib Dem voters. The 5p cut on fuel duty covers 17 rural areas, 14 of which are Lib Dem seats. Three of Cornwall’s six MPs are Lib Dems with slim majorities and Mr Clegg even chose to visit the county rather than attend the Commons on the day Chancellor George Osborne presented his Autumn Statement in December. Mr Clegg said: ‘I am determined to keep [Cornish] alive and thriving. ‘Great efforts have been made to revive and return Cornish to common use. It would be a crime to let such a distinct language disappear again.’ Cornish has not been widely used since the 18th century. At the 2011 census 557 people listed it as their first language. Last April, Lib Dems persuaded the Council of Europe to recognise Cornish people as a ‘national minority’ in England, which means the Government is now pledged to ‘combat discrimination’ against them. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘I don’t know what the Cornish is for a blatant electoral bribe, but with £150,000 of taxpayers’ money I’m sure that Nick Clegg can tell us. It would appear that Mr Clegg is trying to buy votes with public money.’ The money will go to the Cornish Language Partnership, an organisation financed by taxpayers and run by activists and local council nominees. Mr Clegg said yesterday he will stay on as a caretaker deputy prime minister if there is a hung parliament because the country will need a government in place to ‘keep the lights on’. He confirmed he was prepared to stay on while coalition talks are hammered out, which could take weeks or months.","Liberal Democrat leader’s generosity to handful of Cornish speakers is latest in series of extraordinary gestures to county over recent months .

"Artist Tracey Emin has insisted she is actually 'very neat' as she unveiled her £2.54million unmade bed - complete with discarded condoms - on its return to its 'home' at the Tate. My Bed became notorious when it was shortlisted for the Turner Prize and displayed at Tate Britain in 1999. Now, 15 years later, it is back at the gallery on a long-term loan for at least 10 years. Scroll down for video . Artist Tracey Emin has insisted she is actually 'very neat' as she unveiled her controversial £2.54million unmade bed - complete with discarded condoms - on its return to its 'home' at the Tate Britain today . My Bed became notorious when it was shortlisted for the Turner Prize and displayed at Tate Britain in 1999 . Emin admitted that unlike the chaotic-looking installation, which features empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts, stained sheets and discarded underwear, her bed at home is now a different affair. 'I make my bed every day. It's so boring, it's very neat. I'm really OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder),' she said. Wiping away tears, the artist said that seeing the work - which is now subject to rigorous security in the form of a sensor and a guard to prevent visitors from getting too close - left her emotional. 'I'm 52 nearly. Even though I was quite old when the bed came into fruition I didn't look old or behave old,' she said. 'I'm a bit tearful, it means a lot to me. I feel pathetic but there are things on that bed that have no place in my life any more. 'That bed belonged to a young woman and hopefully in 20 or 30 years' time the bed will be here but I won't probably. 'That's what art's about. It's about a legacy, about making something which goes on without you. 'It's a statement of history and now it's in safe hands ... it will never change.' The work, which expressed the artist's suicidal depression following a relationship breakdown, is displayed in its own room alongside two paintings by Francis Bacon and six nude drawings by Emin which she has given to the Tate. Emin said she felt validated seeing the installation on display alongside works by some of Britain's 'greats' after all the criticism about the bed at the time. The controversial artwork was created by Emin in her Waterloo council flat in 1998 and features empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts, stained sheets, discarded underwear, old slippers, a waist belt and even condoms . My Bed was one of the key works of the 1990s Young British Artists (YBA) movement and was bought by millionaire collector Charles Saatchi  for £150,000 in 2000 before later being sold to Christie's and auctioned . My Bed, which fetched £2.54million at auction last year, is now on a long-term loan to the Tate Britain and will be shown at both Turner Contemporary in Margate - Emin's home town - and Tate Liverpool later this year . 'I love it, why wouldn't I? I was right ... It's a good feeling ... it feels like home,' she said, later adding that her fellow students at art school had 'thought I was a bit thick'. Earlier in the day, Emin had told photographers: 'I think I look like the cat who got the cream. I feel so happy.' She later added: 'My Bed is a symbol of that time. It was a zeitgeist. It was perfect for that moment. It has captured a part of history.' Pointing to her belt on the installation, she added: 'I would be lucky if it fitted around my thigh now and it used to fit around my waist. 'There are so many things about that bed that don't relate to my life any more. 'It's a time capsule of a woman living in the 1990s in a really wild way. It's not just sad, but how that bed came about was through sadness. 'It's also about being in the worst situation in your life and being able to pull through and get out to the other side.' Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, said: 'It's a work we've always wanted to bring into the collection. 'It was quite clear from 1999 when it was first seen in the Turner prize that it was going to be regarded as one of those iconic works from the late 90s.' Emin insisted she was actually 'very neat' as she unveiled the return of My Bed at the Tate today. The 51-year-old said the artwork (part of which is pictured right) was 'a time capsule of a woman living in the 1990s' My Bed fetched £2.54m at auction, a record for the artist, when it was purchased by dealer and White Cube gallery owner Jay Jopling last year. He acquired the work on behalf of collector Count Christian Duerckheim . The 'really important work' was being given 'a historical dimension', he added as 'part of the story of British art over a long period'. My Bed is on long-term loan to the Tate and will be shown at Turner Contemporary in Margate - Emin's home town - and Tate Liverpool. The work fetched £2.54million at auction, a record for the artist, when it was purchased by dealer and White Cube gallery owner Jay Jopling last year. It later emerged that Jopling acquired the work on behalf of German industrialist and collector Count Christian Duerckheim, who announced the long-term loan to the Tate for at least 10 years. Sir Nicholas said that he hoped that the Tate would be able to hold on to My Bed for longer than 10 years. 'I'm sure we could keep it. This is a collector who has been incredibly generous. It's all to play for,' he said. My Bed was one of the key works of the 1990s Young British Artists (YBA) movement. Emin, who is now 51-years-old and a CBE, made the piece in her Waterloo council flat in 1998. Millionaire collector Charles Saatchi bought My Bed for £150,000 in 2000 and sold it at Christie's. Emin's My Bed 1998 exhibition opens to the public at Tate Britain tomorrow.","Artist Tracey Emin has insisted her bed is actually 'very neat' nowadays .

"Kelly Percival, 32, locked the 43-year-old victim into her flat at which point a male and female accomplice jumped out and demanded £100 . A honeytrap mother-of-one lured a lonely man to her flat with promises of a drunken romp before two thugs burst in and demanded cash. Kelly Percival, 32, lured a 43-year-old to her flat for a 'sexual encounter' in April last year, but once he was inside he was set upon by a man and woman who said: 'Give me £100 or I will cut you up.' Despite being punched several times in the head, he managed to escape, before calling the police who arrested Ms Percival. Prosecutor Jolyon Perks told the court Pervical had started chatting to the victim over dating site Badoo, using the name 'Jess' on her profile. Mr Perks said: 'This culminated in the complainant being invited to visit 'Jess' for what the victim believed would be effectively a date, a sexual encounter. 'He travelled to the address in a taxi, having bought vodka and cigarettes.' The court heard when the victim arrived at the upstairs flat he was led by Percival, who by then had told him her real name, into the living room. Mr Perks added: 'The complainant sat down on the settee and it was at that point a male and female burst into the room. 'The male immediately said ""give me £100 or I will cut you up"".' The court heard the victim was also threatened by the female before he tried to get out and realised he was locked in the flat. The male attacker demanded the victim's mobile phone when he saw him trying to contact the police before opening the door to let him out. Mr Perks added: 'He was punched by the male to the head a number of times, which knocked off his glasses.' The victim showed police his dating profile and messages and Pervical. Officers then used this to track her down as she had used pictures of herself as her profile images. Mr Perks said: 'The defendant fully admitted agreeing with the others for the victim to go to her flat and they they would then effectively 'tax' him, get money by force.' The man and woman who threatened the victim escaped, and have never been caught. Percival was sentenced to 15 months, suspended for two years, with a supervision order. Newcastle Crown Court heard that, despite being repeatedly punched in the head, the man managed to escape from the flat and call police, who arrested Percival . Judge Jeremy Freedman told her: 'He believed you were willing to engage in sexual relations with him on April 6 when he wnet to an address you had given him. 'When he arrived he was confronted by two other people who burst into the room and demanded £100 and threatened to cut him up. 'Your role was as a facilitator, you lured him to the property, knowing what was to happen. 'There was a plan afoot, it was not sophisticated but you had obviously agreed with the two others that is what you would do in order to rob him of a sum of money. 'I am satisfied, once he had been lured to the flat, you took no further role in the offence. 'Nevertheless, but for your involvement, the robbery could not have and would not have happened.' The judge said the ordeal must have been a 'terrifying' experience for the victim, who has been left traumatised by what happened to him. Vic Laffey, defending, said mum-of-one Percival got involved in the scam to feed her drug habit, which she is now handling. Mr Laffey said: 'Her circumstances, at least for the moment, have taken a turn for the better. She appears to be getting some help and handling the drug problems. She is far better than she was.'","Drug addict Kelly Percival, 32,  lured man, 43, to flat via Badoo dating site .

"A woman has sparked uproar on social media after enthusiastically bearing her K-cup breasts on Google Street View. Karen Davis from Port Pirie in South Australia was captured streaking by the Google camera cars for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. However the 38-year-old mother, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at 'flat-tittie chicks' claiming they are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. Ms Davis had issues with her siz-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I  always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.","A woman has caused a social media storm after bearing her boobs .

"Labour's flagship energy price freeze was in further chaos last night as Ed Miliband was forced to re-launch it as a drive to cut fuel costs. His pledge to freeze bills for 20 months was left in turmoil earlier this year by tumbling wholesale prices. Today, the Labour leader will announce that he would pass a law to force the regulator Ofgem to push prices down by up to £100 this winter. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband has been forced to clarify his energy policy after tumbling wholesale prices demolished the concept of a price freeze, and now he says he will force suppliers to drop bills by £100 this winter . But critics pointed out that when he announced the price freeze, in a blaze of publicity in 2013, he called for Ofgem to be abolished. His officials are now drafting legislation to allow Ofgem to ‘put an immediate end to the overcharging by the Big Six energy firms’ which costs families and business around £2.5billion a year. Labour was forced to ‘rebrand’ the proposed freeze as a price cap when power companies started reducing household fuel bills earlier this year in response to falling wholesale costs. The party had to issue a ‘clarification’ that they would also allow household energy bills to fall and they would not be frozen at a higher level than necessary. Mr Miliband had been criticised for intervening in the market and the industry warned it would put investment in jeopardy. The Conservatives have pointed out that if energy prices had been frozen when Mr Miliband announced the policy, it would have meant families paying bills £100 higher than necessary today. If Miliband had frozen gas prices when he announced his policy back in 2013, households would now be paying £100 more than necessary after falling wholesale prices drove down bills . Opponents of Mr Miliband say this mistake reveals the danger of meddling in a free market, and warn that any further intervention could risk investment and jobs . Last night energy minister Matt Hancock said: ‘This is now the sixth version of a chaotic Labour energy policy that would have put up families’ bills by £100 and could do the same again – their record at setting prices has been a disaster. ‘And only Ed Miliband could propose giving a new power to a regulator he plans to scrap. This incompetence is exactly why Ed Miliband isn’t up to the job. Hardworking taxpayers would pay the price with higher bills.’ Mr Miliband will say today that in one of his first bills of the next Parliament, he would give Ofgem ‘a legal duty to review prices by the autumn – and the power to order price reductions in time for the winter’. He will accuse the Conservatives of failing to stand up to ‘vested interests’. ‘We live in a country where you can’t fulfil one of the foundations of family life – keeping your home warm – without being overcharged by one of the big energy firms’, he will say. ‘It’s been 18 months since I announced the next Labour government would freeze energy bills – so they can only go down and not up – until 2017 while we reset this broken market.’ Labour says prices are tumbling ‘not because of anything the Government or the Big Six energy firms have done, but because of global changes in oil and gas supply’. Labour is set to hand the key marginal seat of Halifax to Karie Murphy, who was at the centre of the Falkirk vote-rigging row. The party suspended her in 2013 over allegations the Unite union tried to manipulate the selection process in her favour. She was later cleared.","Miliband had promised to freeze gas and electricity bills back in 2013 .

"A fisherman told last night about the one that got away – a suspected Russian submarine which became entangled in his nets after it strayed inside British waters in the North Sea. Angus Macleod, 46, was fishing for haddock and skate when he became convinced that a hostile vessel was caught up below his boat Aquarius. The submarine attempted to free itself, taking the 65ft vessel and his two-ton catch with it. Angus MacLeod (pictured) a fishing boat skipper, has lodged an incident report with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch following the unusual occurence . Mr MacLeod was told that submarines were operating in the area when the incident occurred (file picture) Mr Macleod, whose account is being examined by the Marine Accident Investigation Board, said: ‘Suddenly a force beneath our boat dragged the nets from behind us to in front of us. It was very powerful because the nets were full of fish and very heavy. ‘The submarine was then ahead of Aquarius and heading on a northerly bearing towards international waters and bringing our nets along behind it. Only a submarine could have done this – it was a clear, still night and there were no other boats around. ‘Had the submarine headed for deeper waters we might have sunk with it, but I don’t want to dwell on that. 'We were eventually cut loose when the 150ft-long dog rope, which attaches the nets to the ship, wrapped itself around Aquarius’s propeller and got ripped apart. We were then able to sail back to port.’ Mr MacLeod says he suffered around £10,000 in damage and loss of earning due to the damage to his boat . Mr McLeod said following the incident: 'I've been at sea for 30 years - and between the five of us there is 110 years experience - and in our collective times we have never experienced anything like that' Mr Macleod, a fisherman for 30 years, never saw the submarine but is convinced that such a vessel caused the incident. It follows an upsurge in covert operations by the Russian navy in the waters surrounding the British Isles and patrols on the periphery of UK airspace by Russian aircraft. He added he was told by the coastguard that there was no Nato submarine activity in the area where the incident took place. The Ministry of Defence said it did not comment on submarine operations, while Foreign Office sources suggested they would consider the outcome of an MAIB investigation before making any approach to the Russian Embassy. The incident caused damage worth £10,000 and lost fishing time. Mr Macleod added: ‘If you give me the address, then I’ll send the bill to Moscow.’","Fishing boat skipper Angus MacLeod says submarine got caught in nets .

"The heartbroken father of 'Jihad Jake', who died in a suicide mission in central Iraq last week, has taken the blame for his son's actions claiming 'the bucks stop here with me'. Struggling to keep his emotions in check John Bilardi told 60 Minutes that it was clear his son suffered from psychological problems from an early age, but that they were never properly addressed, despite the fact all the warning signs were there. 'I would just like everyone to know that the buck stops here with me. He was my son. I knew there was something not right with his behaviour,' he said. Scroll down for videos . 'He was just a shy, lonely young man,' John Bilardi says of his son Jake who joined Islamic State . The photograph of Melbourne teen Jake Bilardi which was first released to show his allegiance to Islamic State . 'He had psychological or mental issues that should have been addressed. I feel totally responsible for that. 'I should have been there for him. He obviously needed help, and as a parent I wasn't able to do that.' Jake was prone to random acts of aggression and on one particular occasion he attacked his father with a pair of scissors. 'The worse times were when he'd arm himself with a weapon and threaten you with a weapon,' Mr Bilardi said. More terrifying was that Jake was stock piling chemicals to build bombs that were to be detonated in Australia. 'It's hard to process this. But that wasn't him. He was just a shy, lonely young man,' Mr Bilardi said. 'How he got to this I cannot even start to try and explain. Only he knows... He had a death wish.' He is still coming to terms with his son's decision, to run away from their Melbourne home and join Islamic State, a move which ultimately cost him his life, at age 18. 'To see him sitting there with that gun... I just couldn't believe that was my son,' Mr Bilardi said about the now infamous photograph of his son with ISIS members. 'They put him in a car loaded with explosives. They probably just shouted 'praise Allah' or whatever, and sent him off. I can't imagine what he was feeling.' He poured his heart out in the interview about his late son. The teenager is believed to have converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10, shortly after his mother died of cancer. 'Just out of the blue he said, ""I've gone Muslim"",' his father said. John Bilardi breaks down as he recalls what drove his teenage son into the arms of terrorists in the Middle East . He recounts his son's final message, sent from the ISIS bunker to his father, as he was convinced to take his own life. It was: 'Hi Dad, I am very happy to be here'. Jake's radicalisation took place in the privacy of his own home where he went online to develop ties with ISIS. And Mr Bilardi issued a chilling warning to other parents about the lure of terrorists to defenceless young Australians. 'This is a big warning. It's going on, it's real.' His revelations coming, as an Islamic State propaganda website, geared towards celebrating the sacrifice made by the Melbourne teenage jihadi, did anything but glorify the actions of the 18-year-old suicide bomber. The post, titled as the story of Abu Abdullah Al-Austrālī – the name Bilardi adopted after he travelled to Iraq to join IS – gives the teenager some praise as a devout Muslims who prays and fasts often. But the rant describes Bilardi as having ‘a weak body’ and having 'sold his soul for a cheap price', revealing how misguided his decisions were. Bilardi, who fled to the Middle East last year from his Melbourne home, reportedly died after he blew himself up in a suicide mission targeting the Iraqi armed forces at Ramadi in central Iraq last week. Suicide bomber: ISIS leaked a photograph of 18-year-old Australian Jake Bilardi (pictured) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it . John Bilardi talks with Michael Usher on 60 Minutes on Sunday Night, revealing the possible reasons around his son's fateful decision to flee into the arms of Islamic State . The attack was a failure. Iraqi military official, General Tahssin Ibrahim, said no one was killed and just a few vehicles were damaged in Bilardi's suicide mission. The extremist site sought to praise Bilardi but delivers backhanded comments describing his weakness and ultimately the futility of his sacrifice. ‘He started fighting in Baijī against the ISF Rāfidha and was a lion on the battlefield although he was at a young age and with a weak body, he was like a mountain,’ the post, on a tumblr blog site associated with the Islamic extremist group, said. It goes on to say that Bilardi volunteered for a 'martyrdom operation' - code words for a suicide bombing - and that he was eager to carry out the mission. Earlier social media posts suggested Bilardi had wanted to take part in a suicide bombing in Baiji in Iraq, but that he pulled out of this mission because he got cold feet. Instead he fought in the city before again signing up for martrydom and being sent to Ramadi in Iraq. The post said Bilardi was 'full of happiness as he was finally going to meet his Lord and receive the great rewards promised by Him.' But it goes on to mock his sacrifice. 'This brother originated from an atheist family & ended up selling his soul to Allah for a cheap price,' the post says. Jake Bilardi (left) in a school photo from Year 10 - the year he converted to Islam according to school friends, and another image of him wearing a Chelsea Football Club shirt (right) An image of Bilardi sitting in front of an Islamic State flag was posted to Twitter, ahead of his suicide mission in Iraq, which authorities labelled 'a failure' The post said that during his time in Ramadi, Bilardi was very devout 'known for his worship of Allah' and would fast every other day. It said Bilardi accepted Islam three years ago ‘even though his parents basically went to war with him at home tried to stop him from reverting’. 'Happy-slapped': Jake Bilardi was bullied while at high school in Craigieburn Secondary College in Melbourne's north, and video emerged of the incident ahead of his suicide mission for Islamic State . The bullying tactic sees a group of people slap their victim and film it on a camera phone before uploading it on-line in order to humiliate them. Here Jake Bilardi is 'happy slapped' while at school . The former Craigieburn Secondary College student, converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10. A video later surfaced from his school days which shows Bilardi being 'happy slapped' - a bullying tactic which sees a group of people slap their victim, film it and upload it on-line to humiliate them. In December, Bilardi reached Ramadi, a city located in central Iraq, and said he 'made hijra (or departed)’ in August. He was considered a well-educated maths genius, who dreamed of one day becoming a political journalist and even founded a children’s soccer charity but by the time he’d reached his 18th birthday Jake Bilardi’s mind had been warped. If you believe his tale of events - detailed in an articulate blog called From Melbourne to Ramadi: My Journey - Bilardi joined Islamic State fighters in Iraq after years of historical research and a final realisation that 'I was growing tired of the corruption and filthiness of Australian society and yearned to live under the Islamic State with the Muslims'. However, the picture Bilardi paints of himself – a scholar and a rational thinker – is very different to the lonely outcast that his former classmates at Craigieburn Secondary College have described. ‘At school he was a ""loner"". He only really had two or three friends from memory but they weren't the type of friends that if he was in need of some help were good at helping,’ a former classmate told Daily Mail Australia. ‘He was obviously a kid that needed some help or guidance and he thought converting to Muslim was right for him,’ they opined. Another classmate, after hearing that Bilardi may be dead, described him as not 'capable of punching his way out of a wet paper bag. He was fragile'. 'The kid (was) angry at the world and wants to take it out on innocent people.'","John Bilardi reveals on 60 Minutes he should have done more to have halted his son's defection to Islamic State .

"A mourner was told to produce her late friend's death certificate after being given a £60 parking ticket during a funeral. Sylvian McMillan, 70, of Plaistow, east London, was ordered by Newham Council parking officers to ask her friend’s relatives for a copy of the document, to prove she was at his funeral. The fine was issued in October as she returned from the service at the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium in Manor Park to park in a space reserved for the funeral cortege near her home. Successful appeal: Sylvian McMillan, 70, of Plaistow, east London, was told by Newham Council parking officers to ask her late friend’s relatives for a copy of the death certificate, to prove she was at his funeral . The slots were held until 6.30pm - and the secretary was fined despite arriving just before then, prompting a four-month battle with the council’s parking team. Miss McMillan immediately appealed the fine, but weeks later she was sent a letter warning her that she had 14 days to provide a copy of the death certificate or pay the £60. She said: ‘I had to go to the family at such a sad time for them - I was really embarrassed. I thought that was really nasty - it’s left a very bad taste. ‘They shouldn’t be doing that. I had to go to my neighbour to get the death certificate as proof that I was at the funeral. If they’re doing that to me, what are they doing to other people?’ She sent a copy of the certificate to parking officers and threatened to take her appeal to the council parking adjudicator. But she received a letter last month saying her appeal had been successful. Service: The fine was issued in October as she returned from the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium (above) in Manor Park, east London, to park in a space reserved for the funeral cortege near her home . Miss McMillan added: ‘I’m pleased because I was going to fight this all the way. Don’t just pay the money if you think something is not right.’ A Newham Council spokesman said procedures were now being urgently reviewed after the case. She said: ‘Newham Council apologises for any distress that Ms McMillan and her neighbours have experienced during this sad time. 'As requested by the relatives, bays in the residents’ parking zone were suspended to accommodate the funeral cortege and the council was also provided with registration details of these vehicles.' The spokesman added: 'Ms McMillan’s car was not one of these vehicles and she was issued with a Penalty Charge Notice. 'At the time we considered it was reasonable to request a death certificate be provided as evidence. However, the council now accepts that a letter from the family confirming Ms McMillan’s attendance of the funeral would have been reasonable evidence to enable the PCN to be cancelled.’","Sylvian McMillan had to ask late friend's relatives for copy of document .

"Lawyer Yvonne Painter has been jailed for pocketing £50,000 of her clients' cash including £10,000 intended for a hospice to fund a holiday . A lawyer has been jailed for pocketing £50,000 of her clients' cash - including £10,000 intended for a hospice - to fund a luxury ski trip to France. Yvonne Painter, 47, was a partner at a law firm in Leominster, Herefordshire, when she used an account she was expected to safeguard to steal more than £49,060. She used £10,000 destined for St Michael's Hospice in Hereford to take her family on a three-week skiing holiday, Worcester Crown Court  heard. Painter has been jailed for two years after pleading guilty to a charge of dishonestly making false representation to make gain for herself or to cause loss to others. The company had an office account and a client account and there were clear rules stating that solicitors should only use the company's account. But between October 2010 and December 2012, a total of 14 cheques ranging from between £600 and £10,060 were paid out from the client account by Painter. The money belonged to individuals for whom Caldicott Gallimore Solicitors was acting as executor of wills, the court heard today. Painter, from Stoke Prior, Worcestershire, then paid the money into either her account or one belonging to her husband, the court heard. In December 2012, a cheque for £10,060, intended for St Michael's Hospice in Hereford, was put into her own bank account. It was paid in at a time when the office was officially closed for Christmas and Painter subsequently went on a skiing holiday for most of January with her family. Judge Richard Rundell said: 'We live in an age when people question authority and others in positions of authority but thankfully most people consider that solicitors are honest. 'Most people consult solicitors, being quite sure that whatever else might happen their solicitor will behave honestly and properly. 'You failed in that respect and failed quite badly. 'Over the space of over two years you took from this relatively small practice £50,000. 'That was the most severe and gross breach of trust on the part of anyone who was then entitled to call themselves, and should have been proud to call themselves, a solicitor. 'It's difficult to imagine a more serious breach of trust.' Prosecutor Michael Conry said the offences came to light when the office manager, Sue Smith, became concerned about the cheques and contacted the firm's partner, Emily Gourley. She used £10,000 destined for St Michael's Hospice in Hereford (pictured) to take her family on a three-week skiing holiday to France . The Solicitors Regulation Authority was then notified and when police became involved, Painter initially said she was trying to help the business. But at a second interview she accepted she had altered paperwork to conceal her actions. The court heard that she had said she would repay her money and accepted she had used the money for her own purposes. Mark Lister, defending, said Painter became a solicitor in 2009 and had now separated from her husband. He said she was the sole carer of her 70-year-old mother, and was also receiving benefits. Mr Lister added: 'She has suffered as a result of this and she has lost her good name, been struck off as a solicitor and will find it hard to hold her head up in the Hereford area in future.' Caldicott Gallimore Solicitors said it welcomed the two-year sentence handed to its former employee. A spokesperson for the firm said: 'Solicitors hold a unique position of trust in society. 'Yvonne Painter abused that position of trust and it is right that her crimes should be made public and that she should be punished accordingly. 'Not only did Mrs Painter abuse the trust that clients had placed in her, she abused the trust and good will of her business partner and her colleagues. 'We would like to reassure all out clients that all client funds have been restored and that no client has lost out as a result of Mrs Painter's offending. 'We have worked tirelessly in conjunction with the police and the Solicitors Regulation . Authority in investigating these offences and ensuring that our clients have not suffered any detriment as a result of Mrs Painter's crimes. 'Since April 2013 we have further strengthened our financial controls and have improved our governance in every area of our practice.' The statement added that Painter's fraud was uncovered following the firm's own routine internal financial checks and was immediately reported to its regulator.","Lawyer Yvonne Painter, 47, has been jailed for two years for fraud .

"The White House says President Obama will offer congratulations to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following his come-from-behind election victory, but not until after a coalition government is formed 'days' from now. The U-turn comes hours after Obama political strategy director David Simas added fuel to U.S.-Israeli tensions by stopping short of congratulating Netanyahu – and instead only patting Israelis on the back for voting. 'We want to congratulate the Israeli people for the democratic process – for the election that they just engaged in, with all the parties that engaged in that election,' Simas had said. Aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama plans to call Netanyahu 'in the coming days.' COLD SHOULDER: The Obama administration initially offered congratulations only to the Israeli people – for holding an election – and the president won't call Netanyahu for days. The two leaders are pictured during an October 2014 meeting in the Oval Office . White House Director of Political Strategy David Simas said Wednesday morning that the White House wouldn't 'weigh in one way or another' on Netanyahu's crushing electoral win . CRUSHED IT: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud Party scored a resounding victory in the country's election . DESIGNATED GROVELER? Secretary of State John Kerry was tapped to call Netanyahu on behalf of the White House – and made the call in the midst of nuclear negotiations with Israeli enemy Iran . The president's past practice, Earnest said, has been to wait until Israel's president formally asks Netanyahu to form a coalition government. That, judging from history, could take about a week. John Kerry phoned him, Earnest said, on behalf of the State Department – while he was in Switzerland negotiating with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. The White House's chief spokesman also said the administration is 'deeply concerned' about anti-Arab rhetoric that the Netanyahu campaign leveraged in its larger-than-expected win – and will make sure Bibi hears about it. The rhetoric 'sought to marginalize Arab-Israeli citizens,' Earnest said, according to a White House pool report filed from Cleveland, Ohio. 'The United States and this administration is deeply concerned about rhetoric that seeks to marginalize Arab-Israeli citizens,' he added. 'It undermines the values and Democratic ideals that have been important to our democracy and an important part of what binds the United States and Israel together. 'Rhetoric that seeks to marginalize one segment of their population is deeply concerning and it is divisive and I can tell you that these are views the administration intends to communicate directly to the Israelis.' BY THE NUMBERS: Netanyahu's Likud party won 30 seats in the Israeli Knesset, enough to put together a ruling coalition of at least 61 seats by working with other right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties like Yisrael Betenu and Shas . JUBILANT: Supporters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrate as election results come in at his election campaign headquarters . Obama drew fire two weeks ago for refusing to meet with Netanyahu when he visited Washington for an historic speech to a joint meeting of Congress that was arranged behind his back. And conservatives howled when his former top campaign organizer, Jeremy Bird, turned up in Tel Aviv as the leader of a group working to oust Netanyahu – aided by a $350,000 State Department grant paid out last year. Netanyahu was quick to condemn what he called funding 'from abroad' of the group, called V15, whose stated goal was to remove him from power. But when the dust settled, Bibi's Likud party had won 30 seats in Israel's Knesset, while its chief rival the Zionist Union collected just 24. That result is strong enough for Netanyahu to build a governing coalition with other right-wing and center-right parties – and remain as prime minister. The White House has barely kept its dislike for Netanyahu concealed in recent months. The Israeli leader is among the world's harshest critics of the administration's efforts to negotiate a nuclear agreement with Iran, and it's thought that Obama would have preferred to deal with Zionist Union head Isaac Herzog. 'We're not going to weigh in one way or another,' Simas told CNN after 99 per cent of the votes were counted, 'except to say that the United States and Israel have a historic and close relationship and that will continue going forward.' TROUBLE: Jeremy Bird, the one-time director of Obama's electoral organizing campaign, worked to oust Netanyahu thruogh a group that got $350,000 in State Department funds in 2014 . BIBI ON TOP: The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed the country for the past six years. Pictured are Netanyahu supporters cheering as the results come in . He wrote: 'Against all odds: a great victory for the Likud. A major victory for the people of Israel!' CONFETTI: Likud party supporters react with joy after hearing exit poll results in Tel Aviv . Recent opinion polls indicated Netanyahu was in trouble, giving Herzog a slight lead. Exit polls showed the two sides deadlocked but once the actual results came pouring in early Wednesday, Likud soared forward. Even before the final results were known, Netanyahu declared victory and pledged to form a new government quickly. 'Against all odds, we achieved a great victory for the Likud,' Netanyahu told supporters at election night headquarters. 'I am proud of the people of Israel, who in the moment of truth knew how to distinguish between what is important and what is peripheral, and to insist on what is important.' Herzog said on Wednesday he had spoken with  Netanyahu to congratulate him on his election victory. 'A few minutes ago I spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and congratulated him on his achievement and wished him luck,' Herzog told reporters. HOPEFUL: Zionist Union supporters chant for victory. In the end their party won just 24 seats . Support: Norris in his YouTube video . Netanyahu received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star Chuck Norris. In a YouTube video called Please Vote For Prime Minister Netanyahu, Norris said: 'I watched Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech before Congress, and I saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul. I also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the Israeli people. 'I have done three movies in Israel – ""Delta Force"" being my favorite – and I formed many friendships while there. You have an incredible country, and we want to keep it that way. 'That's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only Israel but also the United States. You see, we the American people need Prime Minister Netanyahu as much as you do. Weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on America, too. 'So I ask you, please, for the sake of Israel and the whole Middle East, vote for Prime Minister Netanyahu on Election Day.' He said his leftist Zionist Union party would continue to be an alternative to Netanyahu's right-wing Likud. Netanyahu focused his campaign on security issues, while his opponents instead pledged to address the country's high cost of living and accused the leader of being out of touch with everyday people. His return to power for a fourth term likely spells trouble for Mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the United States. Netanyahu, who already has a testy relationship with President Barack Obama, took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign, staking out a series of hard-line positions that will put him at odds with the international community. In a dramatic policy reversal, he said he now opposes the creation of a Palestinian state – a key policy goal of the White House and the international community. He also promised to expand construction in Jewish areas of east Jerusalem, the section of the city claimed by the Palestinians as their capital. Netanyahu infuriated the White House early this month when he delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress criticizing an emerging nuclear deal with Iran. The speech was arranged with Republican leaders and not coordinated with the White House ahead of time. In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama was confident strong U.S.-Israeli ties would endure far beyond the election regardless of the victor. Netanyahu will still need the support of Moshe Kahlon, whose upstart Kulanu party captured 10 seats and whose campaign focused almost entirely on bread-and-butter economic issues. He is expected to become the country's next finance minister.","White House said Wednesday that John Kerry phoned the Israeli PM – from the scene of his Iran negotiations – on behalf of the State Department .

"Ed Balls, right, has told friends that he does not think that Ed Miliband left, can be Prime Minister . Ed Balls has told friends that Ed Miliband is not up to the job and hasn’t ‘grown’ into the leadership since taking over in 2010, a leading Labour-supporting magazine claimed last night. In a profile of the Shadow Chancellor, the New Statesman magazine said Mr Balls does not believe Mr Miliband has the credentials to lead his party. One Labour MP told the magazine that Mr Balls confided in him during Labour’s 2010 leadership contest that only he and David Miliband were qualified to take on the leadership, saying: ‘There are two people who are up this job – one’s David Miliband and one’s me.’ The MP said Mr Balls now felt the Labour leader ‘hadn’t grown’ since his victory, adding he feels ‘dreadfully sorry’ about Mr Miliband’s failure to connect with voters. The withering verdict will add to the distrust between the two men, who favour different approaches on a string of issues, including the party’s approach to business, airport capacity and university tuition fees. Mr Balls is normally described as Mr Miliband’s ‘third choice’ for the role of Shadow Chancellor, after David Miliband turned it down and Alan Johnson quit. But the profile claims he was in fact the fourth choice, with Mr Balls’ wife Yvette Cooper also turning down the role. Yesterday he said Mr Miliband had not guaranteed him his job if Labour wins power in May. He said: ‘I’m the Shadow Chancellor and we’re working really closely together on our plans, not just for the election but for government. I’ve not had that conversation and wouldn’t seek to do so. He’s the leader; these are his choices. I wouldn’t describe myself as a needy person.’ Mr Balls also hinted he would back his wife, the shadow home secretary, for the leadership if Labour loses the election. He insisted that he wants Mr Miliband to win, but said of Miss Cooper: ‘Yvette is a very talented politician and a very special person, and whatever she wants to do in life, I’m sure she’ll do and she’ll have my 100 per cent support.’ Mr Balls also teased Mr Miliband over his disastrous conference speech last year in which he recounted conversations with a series of people he had met while walking on Hampstead Heath. He said he had been introduced to his future wife by a mutual friend on Hampstead Heath, adding: ‘We weren’t collecting stories for speeches. It was just a walk.’ The tensions between the two Eds emerged as former business secretary Lord Mandelson predicted Mr Miliband will fail to win a majority in a ‘stalemate’ general election and his flagship mansion tax will not raise the tax revenues he claims. Lord Mandelson, picutred, has said that he does not believe Ed Miliband will win enough seats for a majority . The peer also said broadcasters would be wrong to ‘empty chair’ David Cameron if he does not agree to three election TV debates – a key demand of Labour figures. His prediction that Labour is not on course for victory was seized on by Tories, who said Mr Miliband planned to ‘crawl into Downing Street on Alex Salmond’s coat-tails’. David Cameron said security would be threatened by a ‘despicable’ government involving the SNP, which wanted to ‘break up Britain’ and scrap the Trident nuclear defence system, and Labour. Lord Mandelson cast doubt on the party’s proposed mansion tax, saying of the plan to raise money for the NHS with a levy on expensive homes: ‘Not in a month of Sundays will it raise the taxation [that Labour claims], everyone knows that.’ Insisting he would not answer more questions on it, he said: ‘I don’t agree with the policy.’ Asked if Labour would do better with another leader, the peer replied: ‘Do you think your product would be better if you changed the wrapping? It depends what you think people are voting for.’ In the Commons, Mr Cameron brandished a Labour leaflet from Scotland that he said showed Labour had given up hope of winning a majority and was preparing for a deal with the SNP. It reads: ‘We need to stop the Tories being the largest party. That’s the only way to stop a Tory government.’","Senior Labour figures now doubt Ed Milliband can win the General Election .

"Katie Hopkins has sparked outrage once again after being accused of making a Holocaust joke aimed at the wife of Ed Miliband . Katie Hopkins has sparked outrage once again after being accused of making a Holocaust joke aimed at the wife of Ed Miliband – whose Jewish parents fled from the Nazis. The controversial TV pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the Labour leader could 'gas' his wife   Justine  in a message on Friday. She tweeted: 'Pollsters say Justine is the least popular of party wives. He might stick her head in the oven and turn on the gas.' The outspoken star was then bombarded with hundreds of furious messages condemning her 'vile' tweet, with one saying: 'You really are a deplorable and scummy piece of excrement.' Jay Niew tweeted: 'Katie Hopkins should be prosecuted for her vile gas oven and Jewish tweet. She is sub human both in intellect and character.' David Price said: 'Is this in poor taste for shady reasons or are you as stupid as you seem? Check his background, look in the mirror and be ashamed.' Paul Harthill said: 'I seriously hope that wasn't a joke aimed at Jewish people. You really are a deplorable and scummy piece of excrement.' Jamie Bellinger said: 'I liked you, but you've f***ed up this time. Being unafraid of speaking your mind is good. Holocaust jokes are a step too far.' The Labour leader has previously spoken about how both his parents, Ralph Miliband and Marion Kozak, fled the Nazis in the 1940s. He also revealed that a number of his relatives were killed including his grandfather who died in a labour camp. Speaking on Holocaust memorial day this year, he said: 'It’s 70 years since my grandfather died in one of the camps. Scroll down for video . 'He ended up in Germany in a labour camp, which is where he eventually died according to the records. 'There’s horror and there’s hope, because it’s also the case that many members of my family were saved because they were Jews who were hidden by decent people.' The controversial TV pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the Labour leader could 'gas' his wife Justine (pictured together) Around 17 members of his family on his father's side were sheltered in a Belgian village after villagers helped to hide them. Ms Hopkins was also blasted for saying she hoped Mr Miliband would get oral syphilis after his appearance on the Battle For Number 10 broadcast. When asked if he was tough enough to lead Britain, the Labour leader answered defiantly: 'Hell yes.' But that did not impress former the former Apprentice star and she said: 'No you cannot you irritating little man.'

"Millions more pensioners will be able to cash in their retirement deals under reforms to be announced this week. George Osborne will use this week's Budget to grant the option to five million UK retirees stuck on rip-off annuity rates. Attempting to woo the 'grey vote', he will extend to them the same freedoms that have already been offered to those approaching retirement. Scroll down for video . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls challenged George Osborne to a head-to-head TV debate ahead of the general election . Mr Balls got the chancellor to shake hands on it on the Andrew Marr programme after making the offer . Mr Osborne will scrap punitive tax charges of up to 70 per cent for pensioners who want to sell their annuity income so they are taxed only at their marginal rate . Labour and consumer groups have warned the proposals could spark a new misselling scandal as pensioners who are allowed to do what they like with their cash make the wrong decisions. But the Chancellor said it was 'patronising' to suggest that allowing OAPs to use retirement funds as bank accounts would see many blowing the money on expensive holidays or fast cars. He said yesterday: 'I just think that is a very patronising attitude to take towards people who have shown responsibility, saved through their lives, saved for a pension. By changing the law we are trusting people who have worked hard and saved hard all their lives.' Mr Osborne's policy will give those who have already taken out an annuity the right to cash it in for a lump sum from April next year. A crackdown on those who illegally dump waste, from discarded sofas to vast piles of rubble, is expected to be announced in the Budget. The Environment Agency will get an extra £4.2million to pursue the perpetrators of ‘waste crime’ and those who dodge landfill taxes, as well as cleaning up the damage caused. After being given £5million in last year’s budget the agency estimated it raised £16million of revenue. In one case, it tracked 6,000 tons of waste illegally accepted at a waste site at which those involved were seeking to evade £500,000 of landfill tax. With just weeks to go until the election, it is one of the flagship measures in a pre-election Budget that Mr Osborne yesterday said would feature 'no giveaways, no gimmicks'. Other expected announcements include: . - Another rise in the income tax threshold to around £11,000. - A review of hated business taxes to boost small firms and high streets. - Measures to create a so-called Northern Powerhouse, with high-speed links between Liverpool and Manchester. - Fast-tracking the building of 45,000 new homes at 28 'housing zones'. - A populist 2p cut in beer duty and another freeze in fuel duty. - A crackdown on tax avoidance, including a 'Google tax' on multinational firms that try to avoid paying dues in the UK. - A pre-pay travel card based on London's Oyster scheme to boost travel between major northern cities. The planned annuity reforms will give pensioners the same opportunity to access retirement funds as Mr Osborne announced last year for those who had not already taken their pensions. Annuities have become increasingly controversial amid plunging rates and poor-value products. Removing restrictions will allow pensioners to either take the cash as a lump sum or place it in a so-called 'drawdown' product to use the proceeds more gradually. Mr Osborne's policy will give those who have already taken out an annuity the right to cash it in for a lump sum from April next year . Mr Osborne will scrap punitive tax charges of up to 70 per cent for pensioners who want to sell their annuity income so they are taxed only at their marginal rate. The Chancellor, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show with shadow chancellor Ed Balls, said: 'It's all part of trusting people who have worked hard and saved hard all their lives.' He promised 'a Budget for the long-term', saying the Government has to continue 'making difficult decisions'. Lib Dem Pensions Minister Steve Webb, who proposed the measure, said: 'As a Liberal I believe that today's pensioners should have the same freedoms as tomorrow's pensioners to spend their hard earned savings as they wish.' Huw Evans, of the Association of British Insurers, warned of 'considerable complexities' over the tax implications of cashing in annuities. Andrew Tully, of pensions firm MGM Advantage, said the idea is 'full of pitfalls', and pensioners who were sold a poor-value annuity may be offered a poor-value cash lump sum. 'Two wrongs do not make a right,' he said. Mr Osborne promised 'a Budget for the long-term', saying the Government has to continue 'making difficult decisions' Richard Lloyd, of consumer group Which?, said: 'Pensioners who've been ripped off in the past must be properly protected from a second rip-off if they decide to sell it.' Joanne Segars, of the National Association of Pension Funds, also expressed concerns, saying: 'It's clear to see how this fits with this Government's agenda for pensions but what is less clear is how savers will be protected.' Steven Cameron, of life insurance firm Aegon, added: 'Anyone turning future annuity income into cash is giving up a guaranteed flow of income – for their and possibly a partner's future life. Swapping this for a lump sum, calculated based on a range of factors, is undoubtedly a complex and risky decision and specialist advice would be essential.' The Financial Conduct Authority said it would be in charge of introducing protections for consumers who sold their annuities. The watchdog is already overseeing the pension freedoms that have already been granted.","Pensioners will be able to cash in their retirement deals under reforms .

"A striking image that allegedly shows a mushroom cloud rising on Mars has been pounced on by conspiracy theorists. Alien forums say the image is 'evidence' that a civilisation may have been wiped off the Martian surface as a result of nuclear war. The satellite image shows a zoomed in section of Valles Marineris, a 2,500-mile (4,000km) long canyon on Mars, which was captured by the Indian Space Research Organisation. Scroll down for video . A striking image that allegedly shows a mushroom cloud (circled red) rising on Mars has been pounced on by conspiracy theorists. Alien forums say the image is 'evidence' that a civilisation may have been wiped off the Martian surface as a result of nuclear war . French Youtube channel UFOvni Disclosure has created a short film showing the 'cloud of smoke' which it claims could be either a nuclear explosion or extra-terrestrial methane. 'India's Mars orbiter captured something strange in the gigantic Valles Marineris Canyon of Mars,' the video says. 'The image shows a huge mushroom cloud and we may wonder whether it is an enormous rare dust wind cloud, or caused due to a nuclear or methane explosion.' The image was taken around the same time as the Siding Spring comet passed Mars last year. Pictured is a zoomed in version of what some believe is the alien mushroom cloud, showing the crater rim, stem explosion and cloud shadow. The image was taken around the same time as the Siding Spring comet passed Mars on October 19 last year . 'At the moment of the close passage of (the comet) to the planet Nasa cut off the live feed,' said UFOvni Disclosure. 'But Dr Fritz Helmut Hemmerich was able to make a video from 1,200 metres at Tenerife in the Canary Islands showing (the comet) immediately after its Mars encounter and a huge explosion.' Dr Jonti Horner, astronomer at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia, told the Express: 'Fun as it would be to imagine that this is evidence of nuclear weapons on Mars...that's sadly just not the case.' He said looking images of the 'cloud' were an optical illusion caused by the angle of the crater with the trench. The theory that an ancient civilisation on Mars was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race is popular among conspiracy theorists. Last year, plasma physicist Dr John Brandenburg said he believed ancient Martians known as Cydonians and Utopians were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today. Back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on Mars could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion. 'At the moment of the close passage of (the comet) to the planet Nasa cut off the live feed,' said UFOvni Disclosure. This screenshot compares the two images of the same area, with the cloud is only seen on the left . A scientist is to present his theory that ancient life on Mars was massacred. Dr Brandenburg is giving a talk on his research tomorrow in Illinois at the American Physical Society. He says there is evidence for two nuclear explosions on Mars (image from his paper shown) 'The Martian surface is covered with a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium, thorium and radioactive potassium - and this pattern radiates from a hot spot on Mars,' he told Fox News at the time. 'A nuclear explosion could have sent debris all around the planet.' But since then he has advanced his theory to the level that he now no longer thinks it was a naturally occurring explosion - but rather one planned by an intelligent alien race. According to Vice, the conclusion of his latest paper says that nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere resembling hydrogen bomb tests 'may present an example of civilisation wiped out by a nuclear attack from space.' His research centres around the 'high concentration' of Xenon-129 in the Martian atmosphere, and uranium and thorium on the surface, spotted by Nasa's Mars Odyssey spacecraft. Dr Brandenburg says evidence for the explosions exists near two sites that apparently had life in the past, including Cydonia, the location of the famous 'face on Mars' spotted from orbit (left). However, later images showed it was just a chance alignment of shifting dust dunes (right) Aside from this outlandish theory, Dr John Brandenburg has led a rather more normal, and prestigious, career. He has a PhD in Theoretical Plasma Physics from the University of California at Davis. Currently he works as a plasma physicist at Orbital Technologies in Madison Wisconsin. He has worked on a variety of propulsion technologies and previously was an independent consultant on Space Missile Defense and Directed Energy Weapons. Dr Brandenburg has authored a number of books with his latest, Death on Mars: The Discovery of a Planetary Nuclear Massacre, to be published in February 2015. Scientists have previously pointed about that the appearance of these elements is not surprising, as they are natural elements found everywhere. But Dr Brandenburg is adamant they are the remnants of two nuclear explosions on the surface. He will lay out his research tomorrow in his talk titled 'Evidence of Massive Thermonuclear Explosions in Mars Past, The Cydonian Hypothesis, and Fermi's Paradox'. And he is also apparently set to have a paper published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics. He says Mars once had an Earth-like climate home to animal and plant life, and any intelligent life would have been about as advanced as the ancient Egyptians on Earth. Back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on Mars (pictured) could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion - but now he thinks it was caused by an intelligent alien race . This is based on his analysis of two regions, one being Cydonia, where the infamous - and later discredited - 'face on Mars' was found. This, according to Dr Brandenburg, is an artefact from the ancient alien race. Here, one of the supposed nuclear explosions wiped out the civilisation at Cydonia Mensa and another, smaller one destroyed a civilisation at a region called Galaxias Chaos. 'Analysis of new images from Odyssey, MRO and Mars Express orbiters now show strong evidence of eroded archeological objects at these sites,' he writes in the abstract for his research to be presented tomorrow. 'Taken together, the data requires that the hypothesis of Mars as the site of an ancient planetary nuclear massacre, must now be considered.' Dr Brandenburg says his theory could explain the Fermi Paradox - namely why, if the universe is abundant with life, we haven't heard anything from anyone else yet. Dr Brandenburg says Mars once had an Earth-like climate home to animal and plant life, and any intelligent life would have been about as advanced as the ancient Egyptians on Earth .","The image shows a zoomed in section of Valles Marineris canyon .

"As the only man in the world to lift four times his own body weight, Anton Kraft is pound-for-pound the strongest man in the world. The 4'4' dwarf, who resides in Florida, has lifted as much as 36 stone. With women, he is no less ambitious. Kraft , 52, only dates women who are more than a foot taller than he is. For the past six months he has been dating 6'3' China Bell. Bell, 43, who was born male and has since transitioned, admits she was unsure when he first asked her out but was quickly bowled over by his weightlifting skills. Scroll down for video . It's love: Anton Kraft, from Denmark, has found love with China Bell, a transgender woman from Florida . Enamored: Bell, right, says she was bowled over by Kraft's record-breaking weightlifting abilities . 'The tide is turning': Kraft said one day their unlikely pairing will not be so unusual . Pushing himself to the limit: Kraft claims he has technically died five times in the past 10 years . 'I think Anton's weightlifting is so sexy because I think he's sexy - when you hold a world heavyweight title, that means a lot,' Bell said. 'I've never dated a 4'4"" guy and I was just so curious. I'm glad I gave him a chance because he's an amazing person. 'I'm different and he's different, and where we're from, different is good.' In 10 years of power lifting, Kraft claims to have the highest bench press record of all time for his weight class. But it seems he may have pushed his body too far. He says he has 'technically died' five times before being resuscitated - ranging from drowning to falling out of a window. Happy: As he strives to break another record, having already lifted 36 stone, Kraft says Bell is his inspiration . Adored: He is something of a celebrity on the bodybuilding scene, pictured here at a convention . Preparing: Here he is pictured with two workout partners at a gym in Homestead, Florida, where he trains . Doctors also fear he may have a heart attack if he keeps up his all-action lifestyle. Kraft is undeterred. 'Some people say that what I do is weakness, or micro-man syndrome - that I want to do something that I am not built for, to prove something,' he said. 'But I believe there's only one winner - second is first loser. Second doesn't count. 'Overall, I am one of the five strongest guys in the world, regardless of height and weight. 'And I am the only guy in the world who has ever benched four-times his body weight.' Kraft says he loves Bell for her overt femininity and believes Florida is accepting of relationships like theirs . Both of them say they have never felt better than when they were in this relationship . His driving force, he says, is his girlfriend. 'We used to walk against the current, but the current has changed,' he says. 'Florida is one the states that have same-sex marriage - and both of us are basically the same sex. 'I enjoy dating a transgender woman because she was born a male and is doing the utmost to become as feminine as possible. 'I find that most women born as women do not spend as much time on their appearance.

"The grandmother of Heather Mack’s newly-born daughter has been having ‘intense discussions’ with the teenager about the future of the baby girl who is destined to spend the first two years of her life behind bars in Bali . Ms Kia Walker has flown from her home near Chicago to stay in the hospital where 19-year-old Miss Mack has given birth to the daughter, whom she has named Stella Schaefer, after her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer. Ms Walker, Mr Schaefer’s mother, is understood to be concerned that the baby girl will remain with Miss Mack in Kerobokan Prison when a court verdict is delivered in the next few weeks. Scroll down for video . New mother: Accused murderer Heather Mack, 19, pictured in her hospital room at Sanglah Hospital in Denpasar, Indonesia on Wednesday after giving birth to a baby girl. The father is co-accused, Tommy Schaefer . Baby's future: Schaefer's mother Kia Walker was pictured at the hospital on Wednesday, smoking and talking to Mack, and is allegedly pressuring the teen to let her take care of the newborn . Miss Mack and Schaefer have been accused of the premeditated murder of Miss Mack’s socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack and if they are found guilty they will face many years behind bars - or even the death penalty by firing squad. What happened? Heather Mack and her murdered mother, Sheila von Weise Mack, pictured in an undated vacation photo. Mack is allowed to keep her newborn baby in prison for the first two years . In a desperate attempt to come to an arrangement for her granddaughter’s immediate future, it is understood Ms Walker has been talking in detail to Miss Mack about her intended plans to keep the baby with her in Kerobokan prison for the full two years that babies are allowed to remain there with their mothers. ‘The discussions have been pretty intense,’ said a hospital source. ‘There has been a lot of pressure on Heather to think again about keeping a baby in a prison cell for the first years of her life.’ It has not been revealed whether Ms Walker has offered to look after her grandchild - or whether the same offer has been made from Miss Mack’s relatives. 'There is no doubt she is concerned about the welfare of the baby,' said the source. While Miss Mack recovers from the caesarian delivery in Bali’s Sanglah Hospital on Wednesday, Mr Schaefer’s mother has been seen through a hospital window talking to her at length. Ms Walker has also been observed standing on a hospital balcony, smoking cigarettes. While she has not spoken publicly about her son’s murder case - nor about the birth of his baby - she revealed on social media in October that a plea for donations to help pay for her son’s legal fees had reached $10,600. She said she had been advised not to comment publicly on the murder case in which her son has been accused of battering Mrs Wiese-Mack to death and stuffing her body in a suitcase, with the help of his girlfriend Heather. Accused couple: Heather Mack and Tommy Schaefer, from Chicago, Illinois, (pictured in court on March 12) are being tried for the murder of Mack's mother last August . ‘I spent the weekend practicing self-care,’ she wrote at the time, adding: ‘I’ve accomplished a great deal by staying home and being surrounded by my friends and chosen family.’ But now she is in Bali - and at the bedside of Heather Mack while her son paces up and down his cell in Kerobokan prison, reportedly frustrated because he has been unable to set eyes on his baby daughter. The accused couple are scheduled to appear in court again next week but legal sources suggested the case might be adjourned to allow Miss Mack more time to recover from the birth.","Heather Mack, 19, gave birth to baby girl in Bali on Wednesday .

"Fasten your seat belts and prepare for lift off. It's all part of teenage pilot Holly Adams' daily routine, who wakes up every morning to travel to Macquarie Anglican Grammar School via her customised pink and white Jabiru 2200 aircraft. As she flew 3,500 ft above the ground, the 16-year-old looked down and giggled at her fellow classmates who were on her regular 40-minute bus ride from Narromine to Dubbo in NSW. Flying on her first solo flight to school on Tuesday, Holly, who is one of Australia's youngest flyers, performed a smooth landing at Dubbo Airport just 10 minutes later. 'It's a good feeling not having to catch the bus,' Holly told Daily Mail Australia. Meet 16-year-old Holly Adams, who has just begun travelling to school via her Jabiru 2200 aircraft . The plucky pilot said one of the most challenging parts of learning to fly was learning how to land . 'Some of my friend's didn't believe me when I told them I was flying in for school but they were really excited. 'My family know I’m confident with flying and were thrilled to hear I landed safely – and all my teachers and my boyfriend have all been super supportive.' It all started at the tender age of 15 when she started taking up flying lessons with professional instructors after watching a pilot show with her dad one night in September 2013. 'We saw all these pilots flying around farms and crops and dad asked: ""Do you want to go for a lesson?"" and I said: ""Yeah, I'd love to,’ she said. 'And I've loved it ever since.’ But within four months of training, she turned her backyard hobby into a short commute to school. 'It's quite common to see young kids fly out  in rural areas,' Holly said. While she has perfected her navigation skills overtime, the plucky pilot said one of the most challenging parts of learning to fly was learning how to land. 'It was one of the most difficult things to learn but once I had done the land on my own, I knew I could do it from here on,' Holly said. 'I had to learn all the instruments, like how to switch it on and warming the engine up before flying.' The 16-year-old was given her own aircraft for Christmas before she decked it out with her own designs . Within four months of training, the 16-year-old turned her backyard hobby into a short commute to school . After seeking permission from her school principal Craig Mansour this week, the brace student will be flying to school every day from Monday. Her plane, which was given to her as a gift from her parents for Christmas last year, is decked out with her own personalised designs along with her name 'Holly' printed on the tail. Despite her fast-track to school, Holly's boyfriend Alex Panetta or a family member nearby will be waiting outside the airport each day to drive her the extra kilometres for class. 'I'm currently on my L's but I do see myself flying for as long as I can,' Holly said. Holly flies 3,500 ft above the ground, far above her fellow classmates riding the bus to school . Holly started taking up flying lessons with professional instructors at the tender age of 15 . As Holly is not old enough for a driver's license just yet, she said the age to qualify for a RA-Aus license is just 16-years-old. 'I've been flying solo for a few months now - taking my close friends and family up in the air,' Holly said. With the privilege of flying anywhere in Australia, Holly has already started a bucket list of places to go, including a trip to Western Australia with her family or to Nyngan in NSW, where she was born, to visit relatives. 'It's nice knowing if I ever wanted to go to the beach, I can just fly to the beach,' Holly said. 'I'm just excited to fly anywhere I want in Australia.' After seeking permission from her principal, the plucky pilot will be flying to school every day from Monday . As Holly is not old enough for a driver's license, the young pilot said the age to qualify for a license is 16 . She plans to get her helicopter license when she turns 17 and then her commercial license at 18 as well as a career as a commercial airline pilot when she finishes school. 'I would like to go into the helicopters, commercial airlines or private jets,' she said. 'I actually have work experience lined up with Qantas this month so I'm looking forward to that.' And for all those youngsters interested in flying, Holly said: 'Definitely go for it!"" 'You need to be committed and train every day - don't drag it on because it's something you can't put off for weeks or even months as you start to forget things,' she said. 'It feels amazing to start learning at such a young age and you could turn it into a career when you're older - so start saving.'","Forget owning your first car!

"Blame modern life, but it turns out that sitting down all day puts you at more risk of having a heart attack or stroke. However, before you put your trainers on to make up for a day at your desk, experts warn going to the gym won’t help either. A study has found that for every hour each day an adult spends sitting down during their life, the likelihood of developing heart disease goes up by 14 per cent. A study has found that for every hour each day an adult spends sitting down during their life, the likelihood of developing heart disease goes up by 14 per cent (file picture) And they said a session at the gym won’t repair the damage because any increase in fitness from an hour’s exercise is undone by several hours of sitting. The study, presented at the American College of Cardiology in San Diego, California, adds to evidence of the damage caused by our sedentary lifestyles. Government research warned last year that inactivity was as deadly as smoking and responsible for a sixth of deaths in Britain. Scientists from the Medical College of Wisconsin in the US looked at levels of activity of 2,031 adults whose average age was 50. They compared the number of hours spent sitting down each day with levels of deposits in blood vessels that signal for heart disease. Sitting down all day puts you at more risk of having a heart attack or stroke, a study has found (file picture) The adults spent two to 12 hours a day sitting at the office and then in front of the TV. Researchers found that for every hour spent sitting, the levels of artery deposits increased by 14 per cent. Adults who went for regular runs, gym sessions or aerobics classes were no less at risk. Lead researcher Dr Jacquelyn Kulinski, an assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine, urged adults with office jobs to stand up or go for a walk every hour, adding: ‘Reducing the amount of time you sit by even an hour or two a day could have a significant and positive impact on your future cardiovascular health.’ Despite the research suggesting the benefits of exercise could be quickly undone, she said it was important to aim for at least 30 minutes a day. ‘It’s clear that exercise is important to reduce your cardiovascular risk and improve your fitness level.’ ‘The lesson here is that it’s really important to try to move as much as possible in your daily life, for example, take a walk during lunch, pace while talking on the phone, take the stairs instead of the elevator and use a pedometer to track your daily steps. ‘And if you do have a very sedentary job, don’t go home at night and sit in front of the TV for hours on end.’ The news comes as it was revealed that antidepressants could protect against heart attacks and strokes. A US study of 5,000 patients found they were 50 per cent less likely to die or develop heart disease. Scientists believe their improved mood has a major effect on their health. June Davison, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘We know that sitting down for long periods can have a negative effect on our heart health. ‘If you have a sedentary job it’s important to keep active during the day. You can try and get active by walking to see a colleague rather than sending an email, or taking the stairs rather than the lift.’","Fitness boost from an hour's exercise undone by several hours of sitting .

"A cheating husband nearly had his penis bitten off by his wife’s younger friend when he allegedly tried to persuade her to have sex with him. Florin Ionita, 53, had been at a picnic at a park in Chisinau, Moldova, with his spouse and a group of friends - before she took some of them home, leaving him alone with the 24-year-old woman. But when wife Maria Ionita, 49, returned to collect him 30 minutes later, she claimed to have found him clutching his genitals and moaning in pain, telling her: ‘Call an ambulance, it is going to fall off.’ Treatment: Maria Ionita, 49, with her husband Florin, 53, at hospital after he had his penis bitten by her friend . Aid: A nurse at the hospital where Mr Ionita was treated after the incident after a picnic at a park in Chisinau . Mrs Ionita said: ‘I was at a picnic with my husband and some friends and I left to take some of them home in our car, leaving him behind with one friend. ‘When I came back I saw him with his trousers around his ankles clutching his private parts and saying “Call an ambulance, it is going to fall off”.’ After demanding to know what had happened, Mrs Ionita was allegedly told that her husband had tried to force himself on her friend, but she had bitten his penis after he pulled down his trousers. Mrs Ionita added: ‘I have forgiven him as he was only trying to do what all men try to do - but when I called the ambulance I didn't do it too fast, and I told them not to hurry.’ Agonising: The friend reported Mr Ionita to police in Moldova, accusing him of attempting to assault her . She also claimed to have given the ambulance drivers unclear directions to the area of the park in which her husband was waiting in agony. The friend reported Mr Ionita to police, accusing him of attempting to assault her. After being released from hospital he will be questioned - and faces up to five years in jail if charged and convicted over what happened.

"The US military’s Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (Darpa) says they may have a method to stop all infectious diseases - including Ebola. By encoding RNA and DNA in a specific way, Darpa say a person could simply go into a shop and get an injection to protect them against a disease. This could be used to prevent mass outbreaks in affected areas. US military's Darpa has developed a method to stop infectious diseases. It involves encoding RNA and DNA with instructions for antibodies. A person could then be injected with the antibodies at a pharmacy (stock image shown). This enables a person's cells to fight an infectious disease . ‘We’re going to take the genetic code and put it into a format where you go to your drug store or doctor and get a shot in the arm,’ said Darpa programme manager Dan Wattendorf at an event in San Francisco, reported Fusion. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. It is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids. RNA is formed from strings of nucleic acids, the same building blocks that create DNA. Genetic information in a cell flows from DNA through RNA to proteins. DNA is considered the 'blueprint' of the cell and RNA is what helps translate it. Some life, like viruses, only use RNA and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on Earth used this molecule. Proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids. These carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick. Lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles. They form the membrane 'walls' of every living cell and give them structure. They are also essential for sending signals out of the cell. ‘There’s a low-cost of goods, no cold chain, and we would produce the correct antibody in [any] individual directly.’ The method works by creating powerful antibodies from survivors of an infectious disease. ‘Instructions’ on how to make these antibodies are then encoded into RNA and DNA, which are injected into people who might come into contact with the disease. Their cells then start creating the antibodies, protecting them from catching the potentially dangerous disease. Darpa is currently funding the project through Emory University in Atlanta. Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective, would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu or malaria. Antibodies are typically grown in large vats of mammal cells or in some cases, tobacco plants, such as US pharmaceutical company Mapp Biopharmaceutical's experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp. Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective, would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu, malaria and Ebola. Shown is a transmission electron micrograph (Tem) image of the Ebola virus . Infectious diseases, such as Ebola and West Nile virus, will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming. This is according to zoologist, Professor Daniel Brooks, who warned last month that humans can expect to face new illnesses as climate change brings crops, livestock, and humans into contact with pathogens. Professor Brooks says it will be 'the death of a thousand cuts' with society unable to keep up with the speed of disease as it spreads around the world. 'It's not that there's going to be one ""Andromeda Strain"" that will wipe everybody out on the planet,' Professor Brooks said, referring to the 1971 science fiction film about a deadly pathogen. 'There are going to be a lot of localised outbreaks that put a lot of pressure on our medical and veterinary health systems.' Darpa has awarded Emory up to £7.3 million ($10.8 million) over three years to direct the project. Emory is using blood samples from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to test the method. Initially, the technology was being developed in hopes of protecting soldiers from seasonal flu or germs that cause diarrhea on the battlefield, but the Ebola outbreak presented an opportunity to accelerate the research. To succeed, researchers will need to identify an effective delivery system to carry the genetic instructions into the body and learn how to quickly identify the most protective antibodies. The goal is to get the process down to 90 days for most diseases. The group is in the process of characterising several Ebola antibody candidates to find which are the most potent. At that point, the researchers and Darpa will seek out drug company partners. Testing in people could begin within two years, with the goal of having a better weapon for the next outbreak - whatever it may be.","US military's Darpa has developed a method to stop infectious diseases .

"When they bought the house, it was boarded up and in need of a total renovation. But Chris Benn and Rebecca Dennis knew they were getting their potential dream home at a bargain – for it cost them just £1. Now, after six months of hard work, they have a property worth £60,000. However the couple are not in a hurry to cash in – which is just as well because to get the two-bed mid-terrace for such a low price they had to agree not to sell it or rent it out for five years. Through the keyhole: This is the refurbished interior of the house that Rebecca Dennis, 21, and Chris Benn, 22, bought for just £1 . Rebecca Dennis, 21, and Chris Benn, 22, pictured left, are quids in after the property in Stoke-on-Trent, pictured right, is now believed to be worth £60,000 . Car factory worker Mr Benn, 22, and his 21-year-old fiancee bought the house in Stoke-on-Trent under a regeneration scheme. The city council has been offering homes for less than the cost of two first-class stamps as it seeks to turn around swathes of its run-down or unwanted housing stock. Buyers receive a £30,000 interest-free council loan to help cover the cost of essential repairs and refurbishment. The new homeowners agree to repay it over ten years – by which time the property will be worth far more than £30,000. Photography student Miss Dennis, who is eight years younger than the average first-time buyer, said: ‘It’s a dream come true to have a house of our own. ‘We would never have been able to afford a house without the scheme. We had been engaged for four years but the prospect of us actually getting married would have been years away if we were saving for a house as well as a wedding. ‘It would have been years before we could have afforded a house alone. ‘My grandad heard about the scheme on TV and suggested we apply. We didn’t fit the criteria during the first round of the scheme. When it reopened a year and a half later, we decided to do whatever it took to get a place. 'My mum and dad wanted us to get married before we got a house together but now they’ve seen it even they agree that it was too good an opportunity to pass up.’ The couple has transformed the property, which was just a shell when they bought it, and turned it into a home that they can be proud of . To qualify for the scheme, Miss Dennis had to get a regular part-time job as Mr Benn is self-employed. Since they moved in last September, they have transformed the property. They had to insulate the whole house and put up a supporting wall on the ground floor. The house had previously been a three-bed, but the pipes for the bathroom ran through the third bedroom, and the council deemed this unsafe. So the couple took a wall out upstairs and boxed off the pipes, making the bathroom bigger and giving the master bedroom a walk-in wardrobe. They put in a new kitchen and redecorated throughout. Mr Benn and Miss Dennis now believe the house is worth around £60,000 as a similar but slightly smaller property in the same road – which was not part of the regeneration project – sold for £55,000. The £3million scheme, funded by the council and central government, was announced in 2012 following the success of similar projects in Liverpool and Rotterdam. It aims to create new communities in areas blighted by empty or boarded-up houses and a high turnover of tenants. So far more than 120 homes have been sold under the scheme and the Cobridge district of the city – the first area to be improved – has been nicknamed ‘Poundland’. The council had to complete some structural work on the mid-terraced property before the couple could begin updating the inside . The small but modern kitchen the couple has installed in their new home after buying the property for just £1 in Stoke-on-Trent . The couple told how they had to fight to get onto the popular council run scheme, which saw Miss Dennis take a third job . Working hard: The couple has said all the hours of work it took to get the two-bedroom property and then to transform it has been worth it . To support the transformation, police have increased the number of patrols, while the Labour-run council has installed CCTV to deter crime and improved other services. Miss Dennis said: ‘Although the area used to be really good it gradually got a bad reputation. But we haven’t had any problems. The streets are really quiet. Our neighbour is great – he’s an older gentleman from Italy who has lived here since the 1950s. ‘We’re looking forward to it becoming a family area again where we can bring up children and people know their neighbours. To get it all sorted is lovely –though we are still working on the garden!’ Miss Dennis and Mr Benn, who have been engaged for four years, have now completed the work on their dream home . Miss Dennis said her parents had hoped she would marry Mr Benn before they moved in together, but they understand this offer was just too good to miss . A proud Miss Dennis said 'We would never have been able to afford a house without the scheme,' as she showed off her new home . The couple took out a £30,000 loan with the council for 10 years to carry out the work on the rundown property .

"Shoppers are in revolt at Swedish clothing giant H&M's decision to ban people from entering the store with their shopping trolleys. Customers have vented their outrage on the brand's global Facebook page after being refused entry to H&M's new store in Indooroopilly, in Brisbane's western suburbs, with their trolleys. The store opened in the local shopping centre on March 5. Customers have taken H&M's global Facebook page in anger after being refused entry to H&M's new store in Indooroopilly, in Brisbane's western suburbs, with their trolleys . One woman said it was 'rude' she was not allowed to bring her trolley in but others with prams were welcomed. 'When I questioned why, the guy told me someone could get hurt by the trolley, because it made out of steel,' she wrote. 'When I pointed out that prams are also made of metal and are just as bulky as a trolley and someone could also get hurt by them. 'He just replied it the company policy for both our stores. 'Do you also stop people in wheelchairs entering your store cause they are made of steel? Shame Shame on your Stores [sic].' One woman said it was rude for shoppers who had trolleys to be turned away while those with prams were allowed . A man said he had a similar experience saying he took his business elsewhere because of the snub . A representative of H&M replied to her Facebook message and apologised for the 'negative experience', but echoed the response the woman got in the store. 'Currently our policy does indeed restrict trolleys within the store, however we are always looking to improve our experience for customers and are currently reviewing this,' the representative said. They added: 'Please email us at info.au@hm.com if you would like to discuss this matter further.' Dissatisfied with the response, the woman said she would not be shopping with the retailer again. 'I will never again try and enter your store,' she wrote. 'I think your store needs too show some respect to the consumer.' While another woman said she 'won't bother returning again' because she was refused entry for having a trolley . A H&M spokeswoman said a higher incidence of accidents happened when trolleys were inside the store . A spokeswoman for the retailer told Daily Mail Australia they had experienced a higher incidence of trolley-related injuries when they were allowed in store. 'However we do appreciate the feedback we have received from our customers so we are continuing to evaluate this policy,' she said. The spokeswoman further clarified: 'This policy is in no way related to our customers with prams or in wheelchairs who are of course welcome in all of our stores.' But there were others who expressed displeasure about H&M's no trolley policy. One man said he had planned to spend $500 in the store until he was told he could not enter. 'I had my special needs 4 year old in the trolley to keep her contained... the trolley was to have room for the big purchase i was going to make. all that money went elsewhere [sic],' he said. While another woman also felt compelled to share her experience online and said she would not attempt to shop at H&M again. 'I was so excited to check out your Indooroopilly store today but was refused entry because I had my 2 children in a trolley. I won't bother returning again,' she said.","Clothing giant H&M has come under fire for its shopping trolley policy .

"Dr Astro Teller, director of Google's secret X lab, has described Google Glass as the 'poster child' for privacy issues - but insisted we'll 'be seeing a lot more' of the technology very soon. Speaking at South By Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas, on Tuesday, the 44-year-old defended the headset by saying it just used cameras that were already in existence. He also slammed the way people use Google[x] to highlight privacy concerns. Scroll down for video . Dr Astro Teller (pictured) , director of Google's secret X lab, has described Google Glass as the 'poster child' for privacy issues - but insisted we'll 'be seeing a lot more' of the technology very soon. The claims were made at South By Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas, on Tuesday . Speaking to DailyMail.com after the talk, Dr Teller also  gave a rare glimpse into the workings of Google[x], and made a rallying call for diversity in every industry. 'Google Glass did not move the needle,' he explained. 'It was literally a rounding error on the number of cameras in your life.' The 'smart glasses', which act as a computer screen in front of your eyes, sparked furious debate when they were rolled out to the general public - which Dr Teller concedes was a mistake. In a bid to get feedback on the first prototype, 'we did things which encouraged people to think of this as a finished product'. Project Wing's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m (4.9ft) and have four electrically-driven propellers. The total weight, including the package to be delivered, is approximately 10kg (22lb). The aircraft itself accounts for the bulk of that at 8.5kg (18.7lb). The hybrid 'tail sitter' design has wings for fast forward flight, and rotors for hovering for delivery and vertical take-off and landing. Dual mode operation gives the self-flying vehicle some of the benefits of both planes and helicopters. It can take off or land without a runway, and can hold its position hovering in one spot to gently drop packages. Packages are stored in the drone's 'belly' then dropped on a string before being gently lowered to the ground. At the end of the tether, there's a little bundle of electronics the team call the 'egg,' which detects that the package has hit the ground, detaches from the delivery, and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle. And though it has disappeared from the market for further testing, he assured DailyMail.com 'you'll be seeing a lot more of Google Glass very soon.' Another source of controversy is the self-driving car, with fears that technical glitches - even by accident - could pose as a significant safety hazard. Laughing, Dr Teller dismissed that theory. 'People text when they're meant to actually be driving. So imagine what they do when they think the car's got it under control. 'The assumption that humans can be a reliable back-up for the system is a total fallacy.' For now, the focus is on Project Wing, autonomous drones which could deliver products across a city within minutes. Dr Teller revealed the firm will make a major announcement on Project Wing's progress later this year. Google founder Sergey Brin (L) and designer Diane von Furstenberg wearing Google Glass. And though it has disappeared from the market for further testing, he assured DailyMail.com 'you'll be seeing a lot more of Google Glass very soon.' Among the current crop of experiments, dubbed 'moonshots', is the self-driving car, a giant kite-style wind turbine that hangs from a string, autonomous drones, and Project Loon, which aims to bring internet signal to the four billion unconnected people in the world using balloons. Dr Teller, the so-called Captain Of Moonshots, told South By Southwest Interactive Festival that the company has had to fly in helicopters to every end of the Earth - from the Arctic Circle to the South Pacific - to retrieve balloons which exploded during initial experiments for Project Loon. 'We designed our early balloons to fail,' he said. A moonshot is something akin to JFK's mission to get a man on the moon by 1961, Dr Teller explained. 'But what was not ideal was going to pick them up.' And in their desperation to speed up the manufacturing process of the 60-foot balloons, they even tested the engineers' socks to see which made them more agile and therefore more efficient. 'We got the techies to wear thin cotton socks and do a line dance,' he laughed. 'Then we got them to put on the fluffy socks and line dance again… Now they all wear fluffy socks.' A moonshot is something akin to JFK's mission to get a man on the moon by 1961, Dr Teller explained. It has to tackle a problem that improves the state of the world, have a key technical obstacle that needs to be solved, and be environmentally friendly and efficient. And no idea is off limits - if it fits the criteria. 'You'd be surprised the number of people that come up to me and say 'let's get rid of corruption!',' he said. 'I say, 'yeah sure but that's not a moonshot'.' The key component, Dr Teller declared, is diversity in the company. 'People throw around the word 'diversity' like it's a tip at a restaurant. 'But really, having people who have different mental perspectives is what's important. 'If you want to explore things you haven't explored, having people who look just like you and think just like you is not the best way.' Google has built and tested self flying drones designed to deliver packages. Called Project Wing, it is being developed at Google X, the company's secret research lab, which is also developing its self-driving car .","Dr Astro Teller described Google Glass as 'poster child' for privacy issues .

'I had just been smoking a long time before the glaucoma, and for the fun of it,' she told High Times magazine. 'What I did notice is that there were fewer headaches. Didn't take me long to see there might be a correlation,' she said. She added that almost all of her 'use nowadays is medical', according to the New York Post. And while she uses it to treat her glaucoma, she told the magazine that she is also an advocate for pediatric medical marijuana for sick children. People use medical marijuana to relieve symptoms and side effects of a number of illnesses, including epilepsy and cancer. 'When we talk about marijuana and I hear people say, 'Well, what about the children?' Yeah, what about the children,' Goldberg said. She went on to say that families who have tried giving their children cannabis are 'being treated like criminals'. She added: 'Because, as a last resort and after much research, they've decided that cannabis may help their kid. 'They know they may face jail time, but these are their kids and they will do everything they can to bring peace to the convulsions or calm after the chemotherapy.'

"Surgeon Dr Gabrielle McMullin says sexism is so rife among surgeons in Australia that young woman who want a career in medicine would do best to 'comply' Female surgeons are only tolerated in Australian hospitals if they are ‘single, childless and pretend to be men’ a female doctor has claimed, as dozens of women in the male-dominated profession open up about their experiences of sexism. Following controversial comments by a female senior surgeon who told aspiring female doctors to go along with sexual abuse at work for the sake of their careers, more women have claimed sexual harassment is a ‘major issue’ in the medical profession. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, one female doctor said she was told by a male colleague women were ‘f***ing useless’. A consultant surgeon instructed her to ‘get some knee pads and learn to suck c**k’ and another senior colleague ensured that she was shunned when she stood up for herself after he inappropriately touched her. ‘They think they own you, a lot of these guys,’ she said. Other female surgeons, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, told how a ‘boys club’ mentality within the profession led to women being ostracised when they complained about sexual harassment. In an ABC radio interview on Friday, Dr Gabrielle McMullin, a top vascular surgeon in Sydney, said sexism is so rife among male surgeons in Australian hospitals that young women would do best to grin and bear it. Her comments follow a warning she issued to young women at Sydney's Parliament House on Friday, during the launch of a book she co-authored on gender equality. 'What I tell my trainees is that, if you are approached for sex, probably the safest thing to do in terms of your career is to comply with the request,' she said. At the  launch of  'Pathways to Gender Equality in Australia' on Friday, Dr McMullin advised female trainees to avoid putting themselves in vulnerable situations. But giving in to unwanted sexual advances is easier than pursuing perpetrators, she warned, because the sexism is so entrenched. Dr McMullin has stood by her comments warning aspiring female medics to comply if approached for sex in the workplace . Dr McMullin told ABC's AM program the story of Dr Caroline Tan, a young doctor who won a sexual harassment case in 2008 against a surgeon who forced himself on her while she was training at a Melbourne Hospital. Dr Tan didn't tell anyone what had happened until the surgeon started giving her reports that were so bad they threatened the career she had worked so hard for. But McMullin warns complaining to the supervising body is the 'worst thing' trainees could do. 'Despite that victory, she has never been appointed to a public position in a hospital in Australasia,' she said of the case. 'Her career was ruined by this one guy asking for sex on this night.' 'And realistically, she would have been much better to have given him a blow-job on that night.' Dr McMullin's comments have been roundly criticised by others in the medical profession, women's rights and sexual abuse support groups as 'appalling.' Female surgeons, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, have told how a 'boys club' mentality within the profession led to women being ostracised when they complained about sexual harassment . Many social media users are angry at Dr McMullin's comments and have taken to Facebook to express their disgust . The president of the Australian Medical Association of Victoria,  Dr Tony Bartone, 'strongly disagrees' with Dr McMullin's advice. 'This old view of acceptance needs to be eradicated,' he told Fairfax media. 'Sexual assault is a crime and will not be tolerated by our society. The medical profession is not exempt from this maxim.' Despite the attacks, Dr McMullin stood by her comments on Saturday, saying her advice was practical and true, and it was offered because she is 'so frustrated with what is going on.' The public response on social media has been mixed, with many in the community expressing dismay at the remarks. 'We live in a world where we want our girls to have an education so they can have a career and they can look after themselves independently. I sure am saddened by these comments,' wrote one facebook user. But responses from the community have been mixed . Many Facebook  users have also come out in support of Dr McMullin for exposing the sexism . But many others have applauded Dr McMullin for drawing attention to the pervasive nature of sexual harassment at work. 'I think the problem is that she's probably right. This behaviour is not limited to surgeons, it pervades so many professional fields,' writes one Facebook user. 'Don't shoot the messenger, fix the situation!' said another. 'If anyone would know how things work in that system, it would be someone in her position.' Dr McCullin has told Fairfax she's received many phone calls since Friday from women to say 'thank you.' 'It's been hidden and suppressed for so long and it's only when it comes out in the open that you can do something about it. So, I guess this is my attempt to air it,' she said. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2011, surgeons were predominately male, with the vast majority (94 per cent) of orthopaedic surgeons, and around nine in ten vascular (89 per cent) and cardiothoracic (88 per cent) surgeons being men. Only 25 per cent of surgery trainees in Australia are women. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2011, surgery is still a male dominated profession .","A dozen female doctors have opened up about their sexist experiences .

"The Gilliam family were just trying to celebrate a birthday with a nice dinner out. But their night ended in tears when they had to rush their 2-year-old daughter Gabriela to the hospital drunk. The Asheville, North Carolina couple went to Texas Roadhouse this week to celebrate Derek Gilliam's 25th birthday, with their toddler daughter in tow. The family ordered dinner and non-alcoholic drinks - including a cranberry juice for baby Gabriela. Scroll down for video . Dinner gone wrong: 2-year-old Gabriela Gilliam was accidentally served sangria instead of cranberry juice when she went to eat at a Texas Roadhouse in Asheville, North Carolina with her parents this week. Little Gabriela pictured during another trip this month to the restaurant . Worried sick: Tiffany and Derek Gilliam say their little girl found the drink tasted funny, and then started acting strange and getting sick . Apologetic: The incident happened at this Texas Roadhouse restaurant in Asheville. The restaurant has since issued a public apology to the family, saying it was a honest mistake. However, Gabriela seemed to think the drink tasted funny, leading her parents to try it and also notice something was off. What they figured out was that the waitress had mistakenly brought a glass of sangria to the table instead of cranberry juice, like their ordered. Sangria is a cocktail of wine mixed with fresh fruit. It appears the alcohol was too much for little Gabriela's small body, and she responded quickly. 'She was staggering and she was kissing everything,' mother Tiffany Gilliam told WLOS. The experience likely ruined the restaurant for the Gilliams, who appear to have Favorited the joint. Less than two weeks before, they took Gabriela to the restaurant to celebrate her birthday as well, and she was pictured having a laugh while sitting on a horse saddle in photos posted to Facebook.

However, she is now doing better. The incident caused concern for the Gilliams for days, as they stayed up to make sure their daughter slept soundly. 'I was scared that she might not wake up,' Mrs Gilliam said. 'That she'd choke on her throw up and not wake up. It was the most horrible feeling ever.' 'It was very scary. I mean me my mom, his mom, we were all in tears. I don't want that to ever happen to anybody else's child,' Mrs Gilliam added.

"Americans are getting older, but not this old: Social Security records show that 6.5 million people in the U.S. have reached the ripe old age of 112. In reality, only few could possibly be alive. As of last fall, there were only 42 people known to be that old in the entire world. But Social Security does not have death records for millions of these people, with the oldest born in 1869, according to a report by the agency's inspector general. Only 13 of the people are still getting Social Security benefits, the report said. But for others, their Social Security numbers are still active, so a number could be used to report wages, open bank accounts, obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds. 'That is a real problem,' said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. Ripe old age: Social security has not updated the deaths of 6.5 million people, new data has shown, meaning all those social security numbers remain active. Seen here is Gertrude Weaver on her 116th birthday last year. She is the oldest known person in the United States . 'When you have a fake Social Security number, that's what allows you to fraudulently do all kinds things, claim things like the earned income tax credit or other tax benefits.' Johnson is chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which plans a hearing Monday on problems with death records maintained by the Social Security Administration. The agency said it is working to improve the accuracy of its death records. But it would be costly and time-consuming to update 6.5 million files that were generated decades ago, when the agency used paper records, said Sean Brune, a senior adviser to the agency's deputy commissioner for budget, finance, quality and management. 'The records in this review are extremely old, decades-old, and unreliable,' Brune said. The internal watchdog's report does not document any fraudulent or improper payments to people using these Social Security numbers. But it raises red flags that it could be happening. For example, nearly 67,000 of the Social Security numbers were used to report more than $3 billion in wages, tips and self-employment income from 2006 to 2011, according to the report. One Social Security number was used 613 different times. An additional 194 numbers were used at least 50 times each. People in the country illegally often use fake or stolen Social Security numbers to get jobs and report wages, as do other people who do not want to be found by the government. Thieves use stolen Social Security numbers to claim fraudulent tax refunds. The IRS estimated it paid out $5.8 billion in fraudulent tax refunds in 2013 because of identity theft. The head of the Justice Department's tax division described how it's done at a recent congressional hearing. Problem: Social Security does not have death records for millions of people with birth dates stretching back as far as 1869. Seen here is President Franklin Roosevelt signing the Social Security bill on August 13, 1935 . 'The plan is frighteningly simple — steal Social Security numbers, file tax returns showing a false refund claim, and then have the refunds electronically deposited or sent to an address where the offender can access the refund checks,' said acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline Ciraolo. In some cases, she said, false tax returns are filed using Social Security numbers of deceased taxpayers or others who are not required to file. The Social Security Administration generates a list of dead people to help public agencies and private companies know when Social Security numbers are no longer valid for use. The list is called the Death Master File, which includes the name, Social Security number, date of birth and date of death for people who have died. The list is widely used by employers, financial firms, credit reporting agencies and security firms. Federal agencies and state and local governments rely on it to police benefit payments. But none of the 6.5 million people cited by the inspector general's report was on the list. The audit analyzed records as of 2013, looking for people with birth dates before 1901. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935, and the first old-age monthly benefit check was paid in 1940. Many of the people cited in the inspector general's report never received benefits, though they were assigned Social Security numbers so spouses and children could receive them, presumably after they died. The agency says it has corrected death information in more than 200,000 records. But fixing the entire list would be costly and time-consuming because Social Security needs proof that a person is dead to add them to the death list, said Brune, the agency official. Brune noted that the inspector general's report did not verify that any of the 6.5 million people are actually dead. Instead, the report assumed they are dead because of their advanced age. 'We can't post information to our records based on presumption,' Brune said. 'We post information to our records based on evidence, and in this case it would be evidence of a death certificate.' 'Some of those records may not even exist,' Brune added. Nearly all the Social Security numbers are from paper records generated before the agency started using electronic records in 1972, Brune said. Many of the records contain errors, with multiple birthdates and bits of information about different family members. 'We did transcribe paper records into the electronic system and over time that information's been purified,' Brune said. 'But our focus right now is to make sure our data is as accurate and complete as it can be for our current program purpose,' said Brune. 'Right now, we're focused on making sure we're paying beneficiaries properly, and that's how we're investing our resources at this time.'","Social security has not updated the death records of 6.5 million people .

"A self-proclaimed ‘cyber goth’ claimed today that she was forced to leave a pub with her parents because of her eccentric appearance. Laura Kelly, 22, who has a face full of piercings, paints on her eyebrows and brightly-coloured hair, tried to visit her local Wetherspoon in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, with her mother and father. But the student alleged she was asked to leave because her face did not fit in - something the company denies, insisting she was turned away for causing a ‘complete mess’ on a previous visit.

University of Manchester student: She alleged she was asked to leave the pub because her face did not fit in . The University of Manchester student, who insists it was because of her ‘extreme’ look, claimed drinkers at The Ash Tree unfairly mocked her as a ‘transgender’ and ‘freak show’ as she left. Miss Kelly, who is in her third year of studying history of art, said: ‘Two members of staff, a middle-aged blonde woman and a ginger guy with an earring said that they would not serve me.’ Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, she added: ‘The blonde came over and she was irate. She said “don’t bother coming in the bar because we won’t serve you”. ‘One of the customers then said “get out of here - you’re a freak show” and started yelling abusive comments. He also called me ""transgender"", which made me laugh. ‘They all joined in and pretty much evicted me.

A Wetherspoon spokesman insisted Miss Kelly was turned away because during her last visit made a mess out of the pub - something she denies. He said: ‘The lady in question was not served because she had previously been into the pub with a group who had made a complete mess. ‘Wetherspoon appeals to a broad spectrum of customers and their appearance is not a factor in whether they are served or not.’ But Miss Kelly hit back, saying: ‘It’s ridiculous. The last time I was there was probably six months ago and I just had a quiet glass of wine at the bar with a friend.’ Cyber goths form a modern subculture of goths that combine traditional elements such as dramatic make-up and body piercings, with raver fashions including bright colours and synthetic hair.

"A mother charged with murdering three of her children in a botched murder-suicide attempt had tried to kill herself twice before, it has been revealed. A report by the Florida Department of Children and Families says an investigator came to the home of Jessica McCarty in Palm Beach, where she admitted taking sleeping pills and muscle relaxers before texting a friend that she was going commit suicide. Investigators labeled her three children Laci McCarty, aged seven, six-year-old Philip McCarty and Christopher Swist, aged five months, as being in intermediate danger, reports Wesh.com . The children's grandmother told investigators that McCarty, 33, had twice before attempted to kill herself. According to the report, DCF gave the family a brochure, had them sign a safety plan and closed the case. Scroll down for video . Sole survivor: Police said Monday five-month-old Christopher Swist (right), died  three days after his mother Jessica McCarty killed his two older siblings in a botched murder-suicide. McCarty (pictured on the left in a suicide-protection vest with bandages on her slashed wrists) survived the attack and was arrested . What happened to the happy family? McCarty, pictured with her partner Chris Swist, daughter Laci McCarty (right) and sons Philip McCarty (center) and Christopher Swist (in her arms), called the police on herself . McCarty was arrested after she called 911 on Friday and told police she'd killed her children. Laci and Philip were found unresponsive in the same room at the home and were pronounced dead that night. The mother strangled the infant and drowned and strangled the daughter, Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said, according to Florida Today. Police say none of the three children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were found. Christopher Swist had been on life support at Florida Hospital for Children since Friday but lost his fight for life on Monday. McCarty has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. The attempted murder charge could be upgraded. 'Our hearts go out to the friends and family who have lost children in such a horrific manner. The fathers of these helpless, innocent children struggling is simply gut wrenching,' said acting Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens. Police say none of the three murdered children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were discovered . According to Renkens, there had recently been a break in the relationship between McCarty and the youngest child's father, also called Christopher Swist. Investigators said McCarty sent photos to Swist of blood throughout the house. Swist arrived first at the scene and found his son unresponsive on his bed, police said. Police said they found a journal in the driveway of the home that was addressed 'To my family,' which indicated that McCarty was sorry for what she 'had to do.' Letter left behind: Investigators say McCarty left a note behind at the scene saying she was 'sorry for what she had to do'. The motive for the attempted murder-suicide is still not clear . There was also another page addressed to Christopher's father, asking him to keep her son's name alive, police said. On Sunday, McCarty waived her right to appear at her first hearing, sending her attorney instead. In a mugshot provided by the local jail, the troubled mother appears in a suicide-prevention vest with bandages covering her recently-slashed wrists - her mouth agape. The motive for the tragic attempted murder-suicide has still not been revealed. However, McCarty did have a troubled history and in 2009 was investigated by the DCF for possible child neglect. The agency recommended McCarty to mental health counseling after that investigation, according to public records. She has also been arrested on charges of forgery, shoplifting, and prescription drug abuse. Police were first called to the family's residence just before 6pm, when McCarty called 911 to say her three children were dead and that she had cut her wrists. Christopher Swist, the father of the infant, also called police when he came home to find the children unconscious in a bedroom. Phillip McCarty (left) was the father of the two older children Jessica is believed to have killed on Friday night . Seven-year-old Laci (right) and six-year-old Philip (left) were pronounced dead shortly after they were found . Disturbing find: McCarty's partner Christopher Swist came home on Friday to find his son (pictured together above) and McCarty's two other children unconscious. The older McCarty children were pronounced dead on Friday. The infant was found with a cord wrapped around his neck and spent the weekend on life support . McCarty allegedly sent pictures of blood inside the home to Swist, leading him to come home and investigate. When he came home, he found his son with a cord wrapped around his neck and lying on a bed. Philip unresponsive in a corner and Laci unresponsive and wounded on a bed. An autopsy on the two McCarty children was scheduled for Sunday. Palm Bay police apprehended McCarty outside her home shortly after she called 911. Officers said they had to shoot her with beanbag rounds because she was 'uncooperative' and was armed with a butcher's knife. Jessica McCarty had her two older children with Phillip (left) before having a third with Chris Swist . Jailed: McCarty, pictured left with partner Chris Swist and her two eldest children Laci and Philip and right again with Chris Swist. She was treated for her injuries and then booked in jail where she is being held without bond . McCarty was in the front yard when apprehended, but she 'wasn't showing her hand' after several requests to do so. She then showed she was holding a knife and refused to put it down, police said. After refusing several requests to put down the knife, police said officers shot McCarty with five to six less-lethal 'beanbag' rounds, which are meant to subdue a person. McCarty was treated for her injuries and taken into custody, according to WFTV. The tragic incident has shaken the community and a prayer vigil for the three murdered children was scheduled for 8pm on Monday night. Following news of little Christopher's death, friends of his father started an outpouring of support on Facebook.

"With Christmas approaching, one might have expected the future Edward VIII to be full of good cheer. But after arriving at Sandringham in 1919 to join his family for the holidays, he told his lover he was ‘so, so sick of his bloody job’, describing the pain he felt that his royal commitments were keeping them apart. In a recently unearthed letter to his mistress Freda Dudley Ward, the 25-year-old Edward makes it clear – using somewhat colourful language – that he would rather spend time with her than on official duties. Scroll down for video . Freda Dudley Ward, left, a married socialite and mother-of-two, who had an affair with King Edward VIII before he married Wallis Simpson, when he was known as David, Prince of Wales . Lovestruck Edward had an affair with mother-of-two Mrs Dudley Ward from 1918 to 1923, years before giving up the throne in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Edward, who was known as David, Prince of Wales at the time, also moaned about a 'f****** world trip' he was about to embark upon in his royal capacity. Their liaison began in 1918 after a chance meeting at a party in an air raid in London and lasted five years. Then 23, the socialite was a married to Liberal MP William Dudley Ward, who apparently turned a blind eye to the affair. By 1919, the prince wrote he was 'fearfully madly' in love, and appears to have introduced her to members of the Royal Family, including his brother Bertie, the future King George VI. The letter he wrote to her is now tipped to sell for £3,000 when it is sold at auction later this month. In it, he wrote of how he loathed saying goodbye to Mrs Dudley Ward on the morning he wrote the letter. A letter written by Edward VIII to his first mistress Freda Dudley Ward, which is set to be sold at auction later this month . He stated: 'I do so resent this separation and I do miss you so this evening my precious one. I feel so lost sweetie. I’ve been thinking of you so much sweetheart since we parted and am so happy I took you to the station. 'Darling, darling I can’t even start to try to thank you and bless you for all your divine marvellous sweetness. 'I can never tell you how madly and desperately I love you darling and you know it and how yuou mean absolutely all and everything to me in life; nothing else seems to matter now, not even my bloody job of which I am so so sick!!' Their affair was well-known to aristocrats and politicians. In 1927, Winston Churchill travelled on a train with the couple, and noted: 'It was quite pathetic to see the prince with Freda. His love is so obvious and undisguisable.' Freda Dudley Ward and Prince Edward with Viscountess Furness and Prince George of Hanover in 1932 . The prince sent her thousands of letters and the pair stayed in contact until he met Mrs Simpson. He would bombard Mrs Dudley Ward her with extravagant gifts, including a gold watch, and wrote letters to his 'precious Fredie Wedie', signing off as 'adoring little David'. Mark Huddlestone, from Birmingham’s Fellows auctioneers, said: 'The love letter reveals a rare glimpse of the innermost private lives of the British monarchy, and furthermore of an ordinary man completely besotted with his lover. 'The letter portrays the scene of a man, forced to leave his lover over work commitments. 'Writing only hours after their parting, he passionately describes his hatred for leaving her on the train platform that morning, and his longing for her reply. 'The Prince describes his Royal duties as tedious chores, tearing him away from his love and one person in the world he feels at home with. 'Edward wrote to his mistress frequently throughout their relationship, each letter filled with as much passion and infatuation as the last.' The Prince of Wales (left) pictured with Freda Dudley-Ward, and her husband liberal MP William Dudley-Ward, and right, with Wallis Simpson on their wedding day in 1937 . In the letter, the former monarch also wrote of a hair-raising car journey he took with his brother Bertie, who became King George VI on the way to Sandringham in Christmas 1919. The two princes drove at over 60mph on ‘greasy’ country roads to reach the rural estate, bursting a tyre along the way. Edward headed the letter ‘York Cottage, Sandringham’ and, clearly wanting to be elsewhere, wrote underneath the address ‘f*** it!!!’ Writing about the perilous car journey he said: 'Bertie and I arrived safely at 6.00. 'We took 4 hrs to come via Newmarket as the roads were greasy and we tore an outer cover which meant changing the wheel; but the car ran fine and we overran 60mph twice tho how I wanted you to be sitting beside me instead of Bertie.'

"A Romanian man was caught shoplifting twice after being in the UK for just three days. Andrei Alexandru Burnei was caught stealing just hours after he arrived in the country on March 9 and was arrested in Coventry. The 21-year-old was held overnight and released - but two days later he was caught trying to steal £1,127 worth of vodka from Asda in Blackburn, hiding dozens of bottles beneath cheaper items in his trolley. Andrei Alexandru Brunei was caught stealing £1,000 worth of vodka from Asda in Coventry - just three days after he arrived in the UK from Romania in a bid to look for work which had proved unsuccessful . Blackburn Magistrates' Court heard that Burnei, of Coventry, had come to the UK in hope of finding work but this had not materialised. On March 12 he was stopped as he left Asda in Blackburn because a security guard had become suspicious of him when he failed to make any eye contact. Burnei ran off but was eventually cornered and detained. His trolley was searched and found to be loaded with premium vodka, concealed beneath cheaper items from the store. Karen Saffman prosecuting, said: 'The value of his trolley load was extremely high.' At the hearing Burnei pleaded guilty to stealing the alcohol from Asda and was ordered to do 60 hours' unpaid work and pay a £60 victim surcharge. The incident comes after Ionut Tudorache, 25, was jailed for nine months earlier this month. The Romanian pickpocket was caught working as part of an organised gang, stealing mobile phones from people at a Kasabian gig at Bournemouth's International Centre. Tudorache, who had been in the UK just a few days, was caught stashing 22 stolen mobile phones down a pair of tights he was wearing beneath his trousers. He claimed two Romanian men he had met had started stuffing the phones down his tights and he had no idea they were stolen. At a hearing at Blackburn Magistrates' Court Brunei was sentenced to 60 hours unpaid work for the theft . He was jailed for nine months. Like Tudorache, Brunei is unlikely to be deported due to strict laws on removing EU citizens. Peter Bone, 62, Conservative MP for Wellingborough said: 'This is outrageous. 'Only a few weeks ago I introduced a bill to Parliament that would have dealt with this very situation. I have been calling for foreign criminals to be sent back to their respective countries immediately - with no opportunity for them to return and commit further offences. 'It's my view that if someone comes into Britain and breaks the law, they have abused our hospitality and should be sent home and not be allowed to come in again.' Without a court recommendation or tougher prison sentence, he can now only be removed at the behest of the Home Secretary. Scotland Yard recently claimed it had identified a trend in which eastern Europeans were being trafficked into the UK and forced to carry out upmarket shoplifting before returning home on budget airline flights. The gangs accept a 20 per cent arrest rate as the cost of a 'weekend trafficking' operation that can secure items worth up to £100,000 that are taken out of the country for resale.","Andrei Alexandru Burnei was arrested for shoplifting after arriving in UK .

"A man has been reunited with his wallet after it was found in a wall cavity more than 100 miles from his home - 35 years after it was stolen. John Steel, 45, lost the brown leather purse aged 10 when a thief climbed into his caravan while he was on holiday in Devon. But the square wallet - containing a photo of himself and a £1 note - turned up again during renovation work at a house in Shaldon, Devon, now owned by Shelley Davies. The wallet and photograph of 10-year-old John Steel found in a wall cavity 35 years after it went missing . Builders found it in a wall space in this alleyway during renovations at a house in Shaldon, Devon . Builders found the wallet in a wall cavity and she set about finding the boy in the photograph. The picture of the schoolboy had 'John Steel' written underneath and the address 'The Lye, Seend' in Wiltshire on the back. She posted the photo on the Melksham Town Council's Facebook page and within hours Mr Steel's friends recognised him and tracked him down. Mr Steel - who has now been reunited with his wallet - said: 'I was about 10 at the time on holiday in either Dorset or Devon staying with a friend and his family in a caravan. 'My friend's dad woke up at night just in time to see someone climbing out of the window. Luckily mine was the only wallet taken.' Shelley Davies (pictured) said the return of the wallet illustrated the 'power of Facebook' Mr Steel, from Neston, Wiltshire, added: 'As for why I had a picture of myself in the wallet I've no idea. Not sure what to spend the £1 note on though!' The wallet was found by Mrs Davies when builders pulled up wall boards to install a kitchen extension at her property earlier this month. Her property backs onto the former caravan site and was once part of a pub. The deli owner posted a photo of the wallet and its contents on the Melksham Town Facebook page and it was 'shared' 50 times before Mr Steel was tracked down. Her post said: 'We would love to return it - and maybe she'd some light on how it managed to get wedged up behind the fascia boards of our ground floor extension which runs along an alleyway in a small South Devon Village. 'Guessing it was put there in 70's looking at the photograph. 'Maybe the wallet was stolen and hidden there (it contains a small amount of money) or was it hidden there as a prank? Who knows?' Speaking after it was handed back to Mr Steel, Mrs Davies added: 'It goes to show the power of Facebook. I think John is quite amazed and really, really, pleased. 'The sentimental value is huge, but the £1 note isn't going to get him very far these days.' He added: 'It's nice to know that there are still good people around.'","A man has been reunited with his wallet stolen from him as a 10-year-old .

"For those desperately in need of a weekend by the sea, look no further than Scotland's southeast coast, only an hour drive from bustling Edinburgh. While the charming town of North Berwick offers plenty of quaint B&Bs to choose from, the refurbished Sheriff Hall Granary, in East Lothian, provides the perfect base for larger groups or families to explore the area. But, be warned: you will be required to disconnect fully, as WiFi is not always readily available, and 3G access is spotty to say the least. Sheriff Hall Granary, located near North Berwick in East Lothian, Scotland, is a refurbished grain storehouse . As it turns out, the three-day break from our mobiles was a blessing - though no easy feat for seven twenty-somethings from London - as it forced us to get outside and actually speak to each other while spending time in the home's circular sitting room. Finding the house - without cell phone service, I might add - was the first hurdle to cross on our way to a relaxing weekend by the shore. Arriving in Edinburgh on the last Thursday evening flight out of Luton, by the time we had secured our car rental, we were well into the midnight hour. Our first several attempts to find the house, without the help of GPS or street lights, was simply put, a comedy of errors. Thankfully, the owners are used to dealing with such overwhelming confusion and after several hours - and several phone calls - we pulled up to the sprawling granary, which had been turned into a holiday home several years ago by the owner's father-in-law. Sheriff Hall is located just a 10 minute drive from the quaint seaside town of North Berwick . Charlie (pictured) posing at the North Berwick marina, where plenty of sailboats are available to rent . Despite the late night, we woke up early to set out in search of the closest town, North Berwick, with its quaint shops, artisanal bakeries, and most important for our weary-traveller purposes, a Tesco. Our hunt for food was quickly abandoned, however, when we saw the stunning West Bay beach, which in the low tide, seemingly went on forever. The small marina was every bit as picturesque, offering views of the Firth of Forth and plenty of brightly-coloured sailboats and canoes tied up and waiting to be taken out. For those travelling with small children, it's also worth noting that the harbour is home to the Scottish Seabird Centre, where tours can be organised to learn more about the area's local marine life, most notably gannets and puffins. In the low tide, the stunning West Bay beach seemingly goes on forever, overlooking the Firth of Forth . The small town is full of quirky souvenir shops, artisanal bakeries and charming local eateries . On the sprawling Sheriff Hall property, there are many friendly horses (and chickens) roaming free . Back at the granary, the holiday home is situated on a working farm, which means, animal lovers may even be able to take part in the horses' morning feedings, so long as you ask nicely. Chickens roam the property freely, alongside the horses and, at times, the owner's two friendly Labradors. Near the main entrance of the granary is a cow barn, which, especially for the young urban males in our group, provided many hours of entertainment. What can I say? They work in the City. The North Berwick Law towers 187 m (614 ft) above the town, but offers a relatively easy climb along its paths . At the summit of the Law is the famous 'whale's jawbone,' although its now a fibreglass replica . The Law offers beautiful panoramic views of the township, coastline and the Firth of Forth in the distance . Follow the gravel driveway from the house's front door and you'll stumble across the entrance to John Muir Way, a 215 km (134 mile) walking path that stretches across the country, from Helensburgh in the west through to Dunbar on the east coast. From Sheriff Hall, you can walk towards the town of North Berwick and the Tantallon Castle, which turns out to be about a two-hour trek, or, alternatively toward East Linton and on to the end of the trail at Dunbar. Although we initially set out for Dunbar, we unexpectedly wound up walking back toward North Berwick and its staggering 187 m (614 ft) hill, known as the Law. The summit features the remnants of an Iron Age fort and the town's infamous whale jawbone, which has stood there atop the peak since 1709. Currently, a fibreglass replica of the original can be seen upon scaling the hill, after being anonymously donated in 2008. Inside the home, which has been remodelled to the highest quality, there is a working fireplace and piano . The sleeping quarters are located in two separate wings - perfect for families vacationing together . And inside the house, the rustic furnishings are just as beautiful as the stately grounds. The main living and dining area is circular, with several floor-to-ceiling windows illuminating the entire space. A working fireplace and grand piano offer two additional luxurious touches. There are two bedroom wings located on either side of the house and accessible via separate staircases. A second sitting area can be used upstairs, next to the master bedroom and master bathroom . The main staircase leads to a second living space, complete with master bedroom, bathroom and children's play area - perfect if two families are travelling together. On the other side, the upstairs boasts a double bedroom, one room with two twin beds and an additional bathroom. Downstairs, off the kitchen, you'll find the house's fourth bedroom, complete with bunk beds, and during the warmer months, younger visitors will undoubtedly be equally as thrilled to find an enclosed pool off to the side of the back garden.

"Nicola Sturgeon (pictured) said SNP is open to an arrangement with Labour and suggested Labour's backbenchers would support some SNP policies . Ed Miliband will be 'held hostage' in Downing Street by the SNP, it was claimed today as Nicola Sturgeon said there was no way Labour could win without her. A dramatic collapse in support for Labour in Scotland is expected to rob Mr Miliband of an overall majority, forcing him to rely on the SNP to form a government. Ms Sturgeon teased the Labour leader today, claiming he is still 'clinging to the pretence' that he has a chance of winning a majority on May 7, insisting she will wield 'clout' in Westminster. Ms Sturgeon said her party was open to an arrangement with Labour after the election. The Scottish First Minister hinted that many of Labour's MPs would support certain SNP policies such as bringing an end to austerity and scrapping Trident. After weeks of pressure, Mr Miliband has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP but he could be forced to do a deal to stop them voting down his government. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'He is still clinging to the pretence he has got some chance of winning an overall majority. 'We have got vast experience as a minority Government ... the principles are the same. You have to build alliances, you have to win votes on a case-by-case basis. 'It would be far better than what usually happens to Scotland at Westminster, which is we are ignored or sidelined. 'The bottom line here is, if Scotland wants to have that influence, that power, that clout in Westminster, the only way get it is to vote SNP. 'If there is real SNP strength in the House of Commons we can force progressive change.' She also repeated the threat from former First Minister Alex Salmond to lock the Tories out of government, even if David Cameron wins the most seats. Brushing aside claims it was arrogant, Ms Sturgeon replied: 'If the Tories can't command a majority, then they don't deserve to be in government.' Labour leader Ed Miliband used the launch of his election campaign at the Olympic Park in east London today to claim: 'There is one way to get the Tories out and that's to elect a Labour government' Senior Conservative William Hague condemned the remarks as proof that Mr Miliband would be propeped up by a party which wanted to break up the Union. He said: 'Now you have it straight from Nicola Sturgeon – it is the SNP's sworn intention to hold Ed Miliband hostage in Downing Street and dictate terms on how Britain is governed. 'And we know too what's in the ransom note: £148 billion more wasteful borrowing, higher taxes on ordinary families, weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay. Labour campaign chief Douglas Alexander (pictured) said Ms sturgeon has an 'anyone but Labour' strategy and is committed to independence . 'We cannot let this happen to our country. The only way to keep Ed Miliband and the SNP out of Downing Street is to vote Conservative on 7 May.' Mr Miliband sought to play down the prospect of an SNP deal, tell activists at his election campaign launch: 'There is one way to get the Tories out and that's to elect a Labour government.' Labour campaign chief Douglas Alexander told BBC News channel: 'The agenda of the Scottish National Party is very obvious - they want to drive down the vote of Labour in Scotland and they want to drive up the Tory vote. 'Why? Because (Ms Sturgeon) remains committed to independence. She judges the most propitious circumstances to be of a Tory government here in Westminster after the election in May, and after that to try to secure support in the 2016 election in Scotland for a second referendum.' Later Ms Sturgeon told BBC News: 'In that post-election scenario, if the SNP wins the trust of people in Scotland and is there in numbers, then we've said very clearly there are no circumstances in which we would support a Conservative government. 'We would be open to a working arrangement with Labour - not a formal coalition, I've always said that's highly unlikely. 'That could be an arrangement that's akin to confidence and supply. 'If we were to have an arrangement on that basis, we've been very clear we would want an alternative to austerity - modest spending increases that still see debt and deficit reduce as a share of income, but nevertheless allow us to invest in things like innovation and infrastructure and protecting the vulnerable.' She said that a fresh independence referendum would not be the price for a post-election deal: 'Voting SNP in the general election doesn't lead to another independence referendum. 'If there is to be another independence referendum - and I hope that one day there will be - that will only happen if people elect a Scottish Government in a Scottish Parliament election that has that in the manifesto and has the ability in the Scottish Parliament to pass that legislation.'","Sturgeon said Miliband is 'clinging to the pretence' of winning a majority .

Speaking to FEMAIL about her love story, she said: 'I can’t really remember Dave until about the age of 9 or 10. Then he was a ""man"" of 16 and that's my last memory. 'He was always very funny and we bonded over humour. We laughed at exactly the same things, and remember: he’s almost a Scouser and I’m almost a Geordie. Whenever they get together there’s always a few sparks.' The couple, pictured on holiday in 2010, later reunited at his brother's 40th and soon married . Joanne, pictured, left, in her twenties, went blind at 34 due to type 1 diabetes diagnosed at the age of 14 and has now penned a book from the point of view of her guide dog, Uska, right . Love didn't initially blossom for the pair - and Joanne even attended Dave's first wedding as a guest. Meanwhile, Joanne, from Little Sutton, Cheshire, was enjoying a career as a high-flying businesswoman, whose work in marketing took her to Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia. After returning to London, she set up a marketing agency and was enjoying life as a city dweller until she tragically lost her sight. Joanne went blind at 34 due to type 1 diabetes diagnosed at the age of 14. As well as losing her sight,  Joanne’s kidney function is half of a healthy person. She was also forced to have a pancreas transplant six years ago to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks. Before she lost her sight, Joanne was enjoying a career as a high-flying businesswoman, whose work in marketing took her to Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia . Love didn't initially blossom for the pair - and Joanne even attended Dave's first wedding as a guest but they bonded over their humour . After her diagnosis, Joanne attended Dave's brother's 40th birthday celebrations and she and Dave got on so well, it was clear that something was blossoming between the pair. They married in 2008 and Joanne credits Dave for helping her come to terms with losing her sight and helping her stay positive. 'He’s helped me by challenging me to do stuff I’ve never done before,' she said. 'I ride pillion on his motorbike and go away in a motorhome. Also, he doesn’t suffer fools gladly, and won’t let me play on my disability to get out of anything. 'Best of all, he still makes me laugh like no one else can.' The couple married in 2008 and Joanne credits Dave for helping her come to terms with losing her sight . Joanne has shared her experience in her new book, Confessions of a Guide Dog,  written from the view point of her black Labrador of eight years . As well as Dave helping her come to terms with losing her sight, her guide dog Uska has become an indispensable part of her life - and even walked her down the aisle when she married Dave. Speaking about her dog, she said: 'Yes there were many serious issues facing me when I went blind, but gradually, like the easing of grief after the death of someone you love, I realised I could cope without my eyes. 'I was lucky because I never lost my sense of humour. Then I got Uska. As well as the freedom and self-respect of independence, his character brought me laughter every day. Is it any wonder I love this dog like my own flesh and blood?'. Her guide dog Uska has become an indispensable part of her life - and even walked her down the aisle when she married Dave . And now, Joanne has shared her experience in her new book, Confessions of a Guide Dog, which is written from the view point of her black Labrador of eight years, Uska. Speaking about her new book written in honour of her dog, Joanne said: 'It's about life with my fabulous, laid-back guide dog. However, back in the beginning there were a few mishaps and occasional guiding disasters as we learnt how to work together. 'These have gained legendary status and aim to shed a little light on the funnier side of a blind person’s life.' The story of their first year together is available to download from Apple or Amazon Books, with 25 per cent of her royalties going to Guide Dogs for the Blind. Joanne hopes to raise enough money to sponsor another Guide Dog and be able to name him USKA II, after her boy.","Joanne Roberts, 47, met Dave on holiday when she was a child .

"Nasa says the Opportunity rover has passed the marathon mark for driving on Mars. The space agency said the car sized rover's odometer checked in at 26.2 miles — the distance of a marathon. The official time? Eleven years and two months. Scroll down for video . A marathon on Mars: This map shows the rover's entire traverse from landing to that point. Opportunity and its twin Spirit landed on Mars in January 2004 for what was supposed to be a three-month mission. Both uncovered geologic signs of ancient water. Spirit's mission ended in 2011 not long after it got stuck in Martian sand. Scientists and engineers will celebrate Opportunity's achievement by holding their own marathon relay at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the mission. Last year, Opportunity broke the record for off-Earth distance traveled that was previously held by the Soviet Union's Lunokhod 2 moon rover. Opportunity and its twin Spirit landed on Mars in January 2004 for what was supposed to be a three-month mission. Both uncovered geologic signs of ancient water. Spirit's mission ended in 2011 not long after it got stuck in Martian sand. 'This is the first time any human enterprise has exceeded the distance of a marathon on the surface of another world,' said John Callas, Opportunity project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. 'A first time happens only once.' The long-lived rover surpassed the marathon mark during a drive of 153 feet (46.5 meters). The vehicle surpassed marathon distance of 26.219 miles (42.195 kilometers) with a drive completed on March 24, 2015, during the 3,968th Martian day, or sol, of Opportunity's work on Mars . Some of the  highlights along the route as NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity drove as far as a marathon race during the first 11 years and two months after its January 2004 landing in Eagle Crater. This Jan. 6, 2015 panorama provided by NASA of a 'Marathon Valley' was taken by the NASA rover Opportunity. 'This mission isn't about setting distance records, of course; it's about making scientific discoveries on Mars and inspiring future explorers to achieve even more,' said Steve Squyres, Opportunity principal investigator at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. 'Still, running a marathon on Mars feels pretty cool.' Opportunity's original three-month prime mission in 2004 yielded evidence of environments with liquid water soaking the ground and flowing on planet's surface. As the rover continued to operate far beyond expectations for its lifespan, scientists chose the rim of Endeavour Crater as a long-term destination. Since 2011, examinations of Endeavour's rim have provided information about ancient wet conditions less acidic, and more favourable for microbial life, than the environment that left clues found earlier in the mission. Earlier this year an increasing frequency of computer resets has prompted the rover team to make plans to reformat the rover's flash memory. The resets, including a dozen this month, interfere with the rover's planned science activities, even though recovery from each incident is completed within a day or two. 'Worn-out cells in the flash memory are the leading suspect in causing these resets,' said John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, project manager for NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project. 'The flash reformatting is a low-risk process, as critical sequences and flight software are stored elsewhere in other non-volatile memory on the rover.' Flash memory retains data even when power is off. It is the type used for storing photos and songs on smart phones or digital cameras, among many other uses.

"PG tips has become the latest big-name brand to quietly shrink its product but not the cost – in a step likely to infuriate Britain's tea lovers. The pyramid teabags are sold on the basis they contain exactly the right amount of tea for a perfect cuppa. But each one now has had its leaves reduced by 0.2g, meaning a box of 80 regular teabags has come down in weight from 250g to 232g. That is the equivalent of six teabags – yet the price of the boxes has stayed the same. The change was made so quietly that it seems even supermarkets were caught by surprise. Rip-off: Each PG tips teabag has had its leaves reduced by 0.2g, meaning a box of 80 regular teabags has come down in weight from 250g to 232g . This week, Tesco stores had shelf labels with a price of £1.99 for a box of 80 PG tips at 250g. But the boxes on the shelf were the new version, weighing 232g. The change was spotted by a former buying director for Tesco, Safeway and Nisa, Melvyn Searle, who said: 'I have never seen anything like this in my many years in the grocery trade. 'They have reduced the weight of tea in the teabag but not the number of teabags in the box. 'People are getting less tea and that must reduce its strength. It is very strange. I really feel that customers are being short-changed. 'This is one of the biggest tea brands in the country and people will rightly want to know where their tea has gone.' The lighter teabags have resulted in the weight of other PG tips' boxes coming down, too. A box of 40 is now 116g instead of 125g, the 160 pack is 464g, not 500g, and the 240 carton is 696g, down from 750g. Every day, 165million cups of tea are drunk in the UK. Ninety-six per cent of these are brewed from teabags. This means even a tiny reduction in weight can equate to millions of pounds of savings for manufacturers. But last night PG tips' parent company Unilever said that the weight change was due to a different mix of leaves – and that the tea still tasted exactly the same. A spokesman explained: 'We've introduced a new blend and new bags whilst ensuring the same great taste of PG tips. Sneaky: The change was made so quietly that it seems even supermarkets were caught by surprise . Spot the difference: This week, Tesco had shelf labels pricing a 250g box of 80 teabags at ��1.999 - even though the boxes on the shelves were the new 232g versions . 'Our new blend includes a proportion of leaves that have been pressed to release a natural tea juice. 'This, combined with new paper, complements the blend, ensuring that the brewing time is unaffected and flavour of the blend is as great as it's always been.' The firm said it had tested its new bags with hundreds of customers who were happy with the flavour. But Which? consumer group claimed the change was another example of 'Grocery Shrink Ray'. This is the increasingly popular trend for big-brand manufacturers to shrink their products without offering corresponding cuts in the prices. The net result is a stealth price rise, because customers get less for their money. Other culprits in the last five years have included Cadbury Dairy Milk, which reduced its 140g bar to 120g, Walkers Crisps (34.5g to 32.5g), Mars Bars (58g to 51g), Nestlé Munchies (150g to 126g) and Cadbury Creme Egg multi-packs (six eggs down to five). In all cases, the prices remained the same. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Shrinking products can be a sneaky way of putting up costs for consumers because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't. 'We want simpler pricing so that people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest.'","Each teabag has had its leaves reduced to 0.2g but prices remain the same .

"Alleged fraudster: Mark Malik, 33, managed to steal nearly $1 million from investors claims the SEC . A former traffic cop is accused of impersonating a hedge fund tycoon worth $100m and tricking Wall Street financiers into giving him $850,000. Mark Malik, 33, has been charged with fraud after he was allegedly caught out when investors started asking for their money back, according to the Wall Street Journal. He is also accused of spending the money on trips to the Statue of Liberty, online dating and sending investors threatening emails in which he pretended to be a werewolf after his scam was discovered. Malik stole $850,000 from 16 foreign and domestic investors starting in 2011, says a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint released on Friday and is being held on $1m bail. He has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. When investors reported Malik to the SEC for fraud he reportedly wrote an email from a non-existent employee saying that he died of a heart attack. ‘Mr. Malik has been (sic) passed away with the heart attack after accident. We will dissolve the fund shortly,’ the e-mail said. When faking his death didn't work, Malik allegedly sent a clip from a werewolf movie to the investor who he thought had reported him along with the words, 'that's what I think I am.' Malik allegedly told investors that he ran his own hedge fund that boasted assets of $100million, yet by the time he was caught the account for his Seven Sages fund was overdrawn by $310. This December, an industry publication reported on his successful launch of a second $100 million fund, called Wolf Hedge Global Strategy. He claimed that there was a $1billion deal to set his company public and that he was opening offices across the globe. However, the SEC says that Malik, whose full name is Moazzam Ifzal Malik, was once employed as a waiter, a traffic cop, and a security guard and doesn't have a college degree. Scroll down for video . Fake company: The SEC claims that Mark Malik, pictured on the website for his company Wolf Hedge, created false corporations and racked up false accolades in order to steal money for his lavish lifestyle . No higher education: Other than a few classes at Harvard's extension program, Mark Malik has no college degree despite his claims he went to Harvard and worked for numerous financial companies . When investors asked for their money back, Malik allegedly wrote them bizarre emails in reply. 'I AM CRYING, I AM A HUMAN BEING…NOT A MONEY MAKING MACHINE, I HAVE FEELINGS AND DREAMS,' he emailed one investor in February of last year. 'YEAH PUT ME IN JAIL GOOD JOB!' the email continued. He sometimes responded more affectionately with emails saying, 'you know that I love you.' 'I am going deer hunting,' was another bizarre response to an investor’s request from their money back. False resume: The SEC claims that Mark Malik lied about working at various financial institutions he advertises as past work experience on his Linked In account . Big claims: Mark Malik claims that he is the youngest CEO of a company of his kind in the world but he doesn't even have a college degree . Other emails were defensive and angry and supposedly said things like, 'Go f**ck yourself,’ and ‘stop your nonsense.’ It may seem hard to believe, but companies like Bloomberg believed Malik was telling the truth and even reported his supposed earnings and gave him recognition. In March 2011 a Bloomberg report identified Malik as a rising fund manager, based on data provided by Malik, the SEC said. Bloomberg reported that Malik's Seven Sages fund had a 92.73% return on investment for 2012, the SEC said. A Company called Barclay Hedge awarded Malik a 'gold star,' for his fund that reported high earnings. Self proclaimed renaissance man: Mark Malik took to his Twitter account to announce his plans to write three books on his alleged area of expertise . USA Today reports that instead of investing his money he spent it on travel, jewelry, a Muslim dating site, and tuition for classes at Harvard's extension program. Malik spent $30,116 on vacation travel, $36,124, for drinking and dining out, $25.53 at the Statue of Liberty Gift Shop, and a $49.99 subscription to a Muslim dating site. Malik's Wolf Hedge bank account had a balance of negative $310 as of November of last year 2014, the SEC said. According to Malik's Linked In profile he was employed at companies such as JPMorgan Chase  and Merrill Lynch. Love's people: Not only does Mark Malik claim to love people, he supposedly told investors whose money he stole that he 'loved them' in emails . The Wall Street Journal reports that his only experience was a two-year job in Jersey City as a trainee at a brokerage firm called E1 Asset Management Inc., which fired him in 2009. Six months after being fired, Malik started his own fund Wall Street Creative Partners LP which had the same address as his home in Queens at the time. It took Malik a year to attract his first investor and he eventually changed his firm's name to Seven Sages Capital LP. As the years went on, the SEC says Malik kept building on his lies. Back in October Malik took to his Twitter to announce that he was writing three books. He said one would be on start-ups, one would be on hedging strategies, and the third would be on human nature. If he's convicted he'll have up to 20 years of free time to work on his opus.","Mark Malik, 33, stole $850,000 from 16 foreign and domestic investors starting in 2011, says an SEC complaint released on Friday .

"A former friend of controversial Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has called on her to 'come clean' on whether her remarkable cancer survival story was based on a misdiagnosis. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Scroll down for video . Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . Doting mother: Ms Gibson, pictured left with her son Olivier, and right with another friend, founded the popular app and cookbook Whole Pantry . The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) is also a popular app, which costs $3.79 to download. The app is slated to appear on the new Apple Watch . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims in various media stories this week, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. The Whole Pantry, a popular app, gained media attention because of Ms Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival . The company she founded, The Whole Pantry, said donations to charities that allegedly failed to arrive had been 'accounted for and not processed' and that promised donations 'would be honoured'. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia she was 'baffled' by this week's allegations and was most upset about the hope Ms Gibson's followers had invested in her program if she was being dishonest. She said Ms Gibson had the 'gift of the gab' and 'needs to answer to these people (her followers), because they are good hearted people who deserve answers'. 'I don't care about exposing Belle. I haven't spoken to her for months, years. 'I just want her to confirm or deny (her diagnoses) so people who put their faith in her, invested in her - they need to know. 'They need to know, if they've rejected conventional medicine on what she's saying. 'It's their lives, it's not a game.' Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want' After three years of sometimes personal exchanges online, Ms Gibson and Ms Smith stopped talking after the development of the Whole Pantry app. 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want. 'I don't want to see her beg people for mercy. I don't want her to beg for forgiveness - I just want the truth. 'Come clean, be transparent, let the world know where you're at. If you were misdiagnosed, own up to it. 'Belle DID create an exceptional application, that is loved by many, but I think she should sell it for what it is, complimentary medicines and a diet - not life saving treatment. 'All people want is the truth from her.' Close friends told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday that Ms Gibson may have left for the United States. Police visited her home on Tuesday night to check on her welfare, but she was not there. Multiple calls to Ms Gibson's mobile rang out. Amid claims that the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry app has fled to country, more details about Belle Gibson's past are coming to light. The young social media personality - who came under fire after claims her 'terminal cancer' and incredible survival story from the life-threatening illness were false - once described herself as a psychopath. Ms Gibson has previously gone under the name of Annabelle Natalie Gibson, and tweeted in 2009: @bellmneb: 'Is a distinguished physcopath (sic),' the Herald Sun reported. The next month she sent another tweet, from the account which appears to have been removed. 'Obama won the nobel peace prize. This is more f***ed then (sic) the government giving me cancer. #obamawinsnobelprize,' it read.

"The juror who single-handedly saved the life of Arizona boyfriend killer Jodi Arias by voting not to give her the death penalty is speaking out in her own defense. The 33-year-old known anonymously as Juror 17 says she's received death threats and widespread ridicule ever since she remained unmoved by 'brutal' jury room debates and an attempt to have her booted from the jury. In a multi-part interview with KPNX in which 17 will no doubt explain her obstinance, the mother of three maintained she entered the trial simply to serve her civic duty and denied allegations she was some 'stealth juror' intent on saving the infamous murderer's life. Speaking out: The juror who single-handedly saved the life of Jodi Arias this month is speaking out in her own defense after receiving continued threats and ridicule . Juror 17 also addressed her past encounters with Arias prosecutor Juan Martinez, facts that would not be revealed until after the March 5 deadlock announcement. 'It wasn't easy, I didn't ask for it, I didn't want it,' she said. 'All I did was answer the questions truthfully. I didn't want to be involved. I didn't want this pressure.' Mostly, those questions revolved around what Juror 17 knew about the case going in, which, she insists, was very little. She will live: The latest Arias trial became the second to end in a jury deadlock. This one means the killer may not be handed the death penalty . 'I live in Arizona so I had heard about the case and I had seen just when they would come up on the news,' she told KPNX. 'I would hear people talk about it and it wasn't something I really wanted to get sucked in to.' When she arrived to the courthouse, Juror 17 recalls that there were many cases she could have been called to. In now way, she says, could she have manipulated it so she would. However, her detractors point to her previous connection to Juan Martinez as proof Juror 17 wanted to be in the Arias trial and wanted Martinez to lose. Fifteen years ago, Juror 17's then husband was tried and convicted for robbery by Martinez and then sent to jail. Juror 17 says she only recognized Martinez from television. Besides, she loathed her ex-husband and had been open about his abuse when question during jury selection. 'My struggles and my frustrations were always directed towards him,' she told KPNX. 'It's preposterous to me to hold a grudge or to blame somebody for doing their job.' Nonetheless, the conspiracy theorizing and social media vexation raged on. 'Not recognizing Juan Martinez is like saying you don't recognize Mickey at Disney,' tweeted @Kristyannasmom. '@katiecoolady wrote: 'bad enough my tax dollar$ went to a victim trashing defense, now to see a $tealth #juror17 entered the trial, enough is enough #jodiarias' '#juror17...your lies and deception caused so much pain and heartache that can never be taken back!!!' wrote @tarakelley320. Grudge? Juror 17 says she was simply fulfilling he civic duty by showing up for jury service in October. However, her critics accuse the 33-year-old of having it out for prosecutor Juan Martinez (center) for his having put her then-husband away for robbery 15 years ago . Meanwhile, it was revealed March 10 that jurors had questioned the holdout's objectivity because she had previously watched a Lifetime movie about the Arias case, and prosecutors were upset at the juror's social media activity as she went on Facebook and liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network. The juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted Arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend Travis Alexander nearly seven years ago. 'My opinion isn't being heard,' the judge quoted the holdout as saying. The holdout's identity was leaked through a Twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about Alexander, while a pro-Arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence Arias to death for the 2008 killing. Outrage: Social media critics have lashed out at Juror 17 with claims she was a 'stealth juror' out to save Arias, that she had it in for the prosecutor and with threats to her and her family . Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial . 'Juror safety and the protection of jurors' personal and confidential information are topics the Court takes very seriously,' the Maricopa County Superior Court said in a statement. Dwane Cates, a criminal defense attorney in Phoenix who isn't involved in the Arias case, said the leaks won't change the outcome of the case, noting that mistrial decisions can't be appealed. Arias was convicted of murder in Alexander's death at a 2013 trial that became a global sensation with its revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. A new jury was picked to decide her punishment after the first jury deadlocked on that question. Lifetime movie: Juror 17 admitted to seeing the Lifetime film about the case (above) in 'bits and pieces' while being screened for her service. Her fellow jurors would later use this to try to get her removed from the jury . A mistrial was declared after five days of deliberations, removing the death penalty as a possible punishment for Arias. The judge is scheduled to decide on April 13 whether Arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years. Most of the jurors said last week that they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty. Judge Sherry Stephens had individually questioned some of the jurors, including the holdout, who said she wasn't socializing at lunch with other jurors in an effort to be impartial. Stephens said the holdout had disclosed, before being picked as a juror, that she had seen the Lifetime movie about the Arias case, but never watched it all the way through. The judge said the holdout juror didn't commit misconduct because she clearly disclosed that she had seen the movie. The judge also refused a request by prosecutors to remove the holdout from the jury because she had liked on her Facebook page another film that Arias found influential. And the case's chief investigator said the holdout, who had claimed she had recently been keeping away from Facebook, had liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network. Tragedy: Arias' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with Alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later .","Anonymous Juror 17, the 33-year-old Arizona woman and lone death penalty no vote says she's received death threats since the deadlock this month .

"Apple is planning to overhaul its set top box to bring apps to the TV for the first time. The firm is planning to to unveil its new device at its annual World Wide Developers Conference in San Francisco, just weeks after dropping to price of its current box from $99 to $69. It is also believed to be working on a 25 channel live streaming TV service, which could be revealed at the same time. Scroll down for video . Apple has made repeated attempts to crack the TV business. In his biography of Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson quoted the late Apple co-founder as saying : 'I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use. It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud' At its Watch event earlier this month Tim Cook announced Apple's partnership with HBO for the launch of HBO Now. The on-demand service will offer all of HBO's shows for $14.99 a month. HBO's boss Richard Plepler said: 'All you need is a broadband connection and an Apple device.' There will be a brand new HBO Now channel on Apple TV, iPhones and iPads. The service is launching in April, in time for Game of Thrones and for people who sign up in April, they will get the first month free. Apple also dropped the price of its TV box from $99 to $69 and Mr Cook hinted at plans for an updated Apple TV set. 'Apple TV will reinvent the way you watch television - and this is just the beginning,' said the chief executive. The firm has been hinting at its plans for a TV for several years. Apple has described TV as an 'area of intense interest, and  Apple SVP of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue said last year at the Code Conference, 'the TV experience sucks.' At Apple's Spring Forward event earlier this month, Tim Cook reveal the price cut, and a deal with HBO, saying: 'Apple TV will reinvent the way you watch television - and this is just the beginning,' said the chief executive. According to John Paczkowski at BuzzFeed News , Apple intends to show the updated device off at its annual World Wide Developers Conference in June along with a long-awaited App Store and a software development kit to help developers populate it. 'Sources say Apple's new Apple TV is a significant overhaul of the device, one intended to undergird Apple's vision of what the TV viewing experience should be, and to raise the table stakes in a set-top box market cluttered with barely differentiated devices from Amazon, Roku, and others,' he wrote. 'If I'm understanding the company's strategy correctly, the new Apple TV isn't just a play for a stake of the streaming TV market, but for the mythical digital living room. 'Think TV, music, apps and a little bit of home automation as well.' The system is expected to use the company's latest A8 system-on-chip and support Siri voice control of Apple TV. It is also expected to include support for Homekit-enabled home automation devices - which include everything from lights to garage door openers. Apple is It is also believed to be working on a 25 channel live streaming TV service, which could be revealed at the same time. Channels are expected to include CBS, ESPN and FX, but it will strip out some of the smaller channels that come packaged on cable services. It is also expected to only be available in the US, although this hasn't been confirmed. The news follows Apple's partnership with HBO, announced at its Watch event earlier this month. Called HBO Now, the on-demand service is launching exclusively on Apple devices next month and this is said to be a 'taster' for what's to come later this year. Apple also recently cut the price of its Apple TV from $99 to $69. Last month reports claimed Apple was working on a Netflix rival. Sources at the time said the service would put together bundles of programming, rather than entire TV lineups. And Apple is said to have shown programmers demos of the proposed service, but talks seem to be in the early stages. Apple has made repeated attempts to crack the TV business. In his biography of Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson quoted the late Apple co-founder as saying : 'I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use. It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud.' 'It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it.'' In 2009, Apple proposed a $30-a-month subscription service, and since then the company has periodically tried different strategies. Apple's most recent plan has been to work with pay-TV providers like Time Warner Cable to provide a hardware/software offering to those company's customers. Apple also dropped the price of its TV box from $99 to $69 and Mr Cook hinted at plans for an updated Apple TV set. 'Apple TV will reinvent the way you watch television - and this is just the beginning,' said Mr Cook . Apple boss Tim Cook has also said several times  the company wants to figure out how to crack TV. At the Code conference last May, Apple media boss Eddy Cue told Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher that 'the TV experience sucks.' 'All we have today is glorified VCRs,' Cue said, saying the only big improvement is that now you don't have to reset the clock when the power goes out. 'The experience has been stuck.' Apple also recently bought an Israeli firm that creates technology which could mean the end of the TV remote - and even the computer keyboard and was recently granted a patent for 'Minority Report'-style 3D gesture controls. The system uses a 3D camera to track movement, and use it to control an on screen interface - which could be a computer or the much anticipated Apple TV.","New Apple TV will have faster processor and access to app store .

"William Tallon was more than just the Queen Mother’s favourite servant. He rose from impoverished beginnings to become her confidant and close friend. As the first part of a remarkable new biography revealed last week, Tallon was also a predatory homosexual who breached Royal security by bringing young men back to Clarence House at night. And he made powerful enemies. Here, in the final extract of Backstairs Billy, we reveal that courtiers took their revenge by banishing him from the Queen Mother’s side, shamefully disregarding her wish that he should be allowed to live at Clarence House for the rest of his life. And whatever became of his meticulous diary, the ‘black book’ of life with the Royals? So close: Billy with the Queen Mother on her 88th birthday in 1988 (right). He cuts a lonely figure in 2003 (left), a year after her death . Within days of Billy Tallon’s death in November 2007, a small group of men were seen entering his flat in Kennington, South London. All Billy’s possessions were boxed up and put in storage. There is no proof that things went missing, but the speed with which events occurred shocked his friends, one of whom said: ‘It was all very odd. Would you expect your former employer to visit your house and go through your things? We don’t know for sure, but that’s what we think happened – the Royal household had sent a team to go through Billy’s possessions before they were sold...’ Billy Tallon would tell anyone who listened that the Queen Mother had promised him that his little gatehouse cottage at Clarence House would be his home for life. ‘I thought she had left instructions to that effect but I could hardly ask her to put it in writing to me,’ he said. ‘I suppose I was rather naive in thinking that a letter would survive if it meant everyone had to put up with me for a few more years. In some ways they were quite ruthless, you know.’ Rumours: Billy said he knew Princess Diana was having affairs while still married to Prince Charles . Some months after the Queen Mother’s death in March 2002, Billy received a short letter telling him that Gate Lodge had to be vacated. The deadline gave him little time, but he obediently packed his things and left. There was no leaving party, no letter of thanks, no formal goodbye. An official made sure he was out on time. Billy didn’t find his new life easy. His 51 years of service had given him no time to learn how to live in the evenings and at weekends. For years he had organised lunches and dinners for the Queen Mother, but he had never had to make his own meals. Now his life of privilege was over: he shambled along to the shops like any other elderly single man. He began to eat irregularly and sometimes not at all. He was also shocked at the cost of a good bottle of wine. Billy had developed a taste for the finer things in life and he was suddenly cut off from them all. But there were compensations. Billy was an amusing man with a remarkable history and he was invited to an endless series of parties, which gave him a faint glow of the life he had once enjoyed with the Queen Mother. ‘I go to these things because I find it so difficult to be on my own,’ he confessed. ‘I enjoy the parties, but would happily give them up if I could go back to my old life.’ Billy spent night after night in his local pub, The Dog House, where he would get drunk and invite all and sundry back to the flat – anything was better than being alone. A friend recalled: ‘Billy sometimes went into terrible glooms that were alleviated only by alcohol. It was a habit he had got into at Clarence House. Alcohol restored some of his charm, his confidence and his wit. But the fact he was no longer drinking the finest wines in the finest company – as he saw it – took a lot of getting used to and he never really managed it.’ Despite being regaled as the grand old man of Royal service, his friends say that Billy became a humbler figure in exile. Power had corrupted him and he knew it. He had been beastly, he once said, to some of those who worked for him and I think he felt rather bad about it. ‘I was naive, I suppose,’ he said. ‘The household disliked me because I was too close to the Queen Mother. I remember one of the advisers saying, “Who on earth do you think you are?” I replied, “I’m a shopkeeper’s son from Coventry but I’m afraid my company is preferable to yours.” I enjoyed my little victory, but I can’t imagine he ever forgave me.’ In his most bitter moments, he recalled how, in the Queen Mother’s last months, when she was too confused to know what was going on around her, he became so frustrated by repeated refusals to let him see her that he became hysterical. He was told that if he did not calm down, the police would be called. Close friends: The loyal servant dancing with the Queen Mother at Balmoral as Prince Charles watches . Royal advice: The Queen Mother (pictured with Queen Elizabeth, left, and Princess Margaret, right) had told Billy to 'never trust anyone' ‘I was upset and they didn’t care,’ he said. ‘As far as the household was concerned, I was simply an ex-employee as if I’d worked in the Palace for six months washing bottles. It hurt, but the truth is some members of the Royal household enjoyed my unhappiness. It was time for their revenge. They knew the Queen Mother could no longer protect me so the knives were out. I suppose I was silly not to have known it would happen.’ Perhaps Billy, more than anyone, should have heeded the advice given to him by the Queen Mother, who told him at the beginning of their relationship: ‘Whatever you do, William, never trust anyone. Ever.’ Billy often told me he wanted to save his best stories for publication. The Royals, he explained, are very careful about what they say and do. But Billy knew their secrets. He knew, for example, or at least said he knew, that Princess Diana was having affairs while still married to Prince Charles and long before it was generally known that the marriage was in trouble. He also knew a great deal about the younger generation of Royals. Ironically, given his own lifestyle, he was scathing about the younger ones drinking and tumbling out of clubs at 2am. A close friend of Billy’s said: ‘He was definitely writing something, which is perhaps why so many odd things happened after he died. ‘I’m sure that in the same way that someone probably destroyed the Queen Mother’s instructions that Billy should be allowed to stay on at Gate Lodge, they also destroyed whatever it was he had written about his life at Clarence House.’ When, some months after his funeral, Billy’s possessions came up for auction at a provincial sale room in Colchester, Essex, they represented just a small part of his possessions. I know that because I visited the flat regularly. Another oddity is that not a scrap of written material survived the visit by the unidentified team of young men seen visiting his apartment, including the memoir he was thought to be writing – and especially his ‘black book’, as his diary was known. Billy Tallon would tell anyone who listened that the Queen Mother had promised him  his little gatehouse cottage at Clarence House (pictured) would be his home for life . His solicitor, who was also his executor, clearly felt a few letters and mementos were unlikely to fetch a fortune. In the event, however, it took more than ten hours to dispose of more than 700 lots that raised a total close to £500,000. The highlight was a short, handwritten letter from the Queen Mother to Billy asking him to prepare for an outdoor lunch on a trip to Scotland. It finishes: ‘I think that I will take two small bottles of Dubonnet and gin with me this morning, in case it is needed.’ The letter went to an anonymous bidder for a £16,000. But the assumption that these memoirs might have been especially revealing, vindictive or damaging to the Royal Family are probably wrong. Billy felt uniquely privileged to have worked for so long in a job that he loved.

"Government cuts after the next election will be even deeper than previously announced – but will come to an end earlier than planned, Treasury figures revealed today. George Osborne said he needed to slash a further £30billion from government spending by 2017/18, with £12billion of savings coming from the welfare budget. The Government's spending watchdog said the planned cuts would be deeper than 'anything seen over the past five years'. But once the books have been balanced the Government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade in 2019/20. George Osborne's planned cuts will be deeper than 'anything seen over the past five years'. But once the books have been balanced the Government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade . Government spending as a percentage of GDP will no longer fall to the lowest level since the 1930s, after Mr Osborne dropped plans to run a £23billion surplus in 2019/20 . The Office for Budget Responsibility said the plans amounted to a 'rollercoaster' of public spending. Mr Osborne's proposal to end austerity a year earlier than expected appeared to be designed to blunt Labour's claim that state spending will shrink to a level not seen since the 1930s. But delivering his Budget today, the Chancellor said new plans would mean state spending as a share of national income the same size as Britain had in 2000 - when Labour was in office - but before, Mr Osborne said, 'spending got out of control'. The Chancellor used his speech to trumpet official forecasts showing better economic growth. Borrowing will also be £5billion less than expected over the next three years, he said. Mr Osborne said official predictions also saw the national debt starting to fall earlier than had previously been thought. National debt as a proportion of GDP will start to fall next year, not 2016/17 as previously thought. Under George Osborne's plans, Government spending will fall as a proportion of GDP to a level last seen in 2000 under Tony Blair . The Government is still spending £90 billion more than it raises in taxes – and this will only be wiped out by 2018/19. For 2015/16, the deficit will be cut to £75.3billion in 2015/16 and then £39.4billion the following year. In 2017/18 it will fall to £12.8billion before moving into a surplus of £5.2billion the year after. But in 2019/20, the planned surplus will only rise to £7billion instead of the previously planned £23.1billion. Meanwhile, debt as a proportion of GDP is expected to fall in the next fiscal year to 80.2 per cent. He said: 'This is a Budget that takes Britain one more big step on the road from austerity to prosperity. 'Because the national debt share is falling a year earlier than forecast at the Autumn Statement, the squeeze on public spending ends a year earlier too. 'In the final year of this decade, 2019-20, public spending will grow in line with the growth of the economy. We can do that while still running a healthy surplus to bear down on our debt.'","Government will slash £30bn from government spending by 2017/18 .

In this picture Cara's face is on the left whilst Olivia's face is on the right, and it is clear to see the girl from Uruguay bears a striking resemblance to the model . In fact, she seems to have the 22-year-old's facial movements down pat. Olivia regularly posts photographs of herself crossing her eyes, just like Cara. And, in a picture in which her face has been Photoshopped with Cara's, their similarities are even more obvious. The fan captioned the split of their faces: 'I wish cara could follow me or like my pic. If you think that i look a little like her pls tag her its really important for me because she is my idol. Thanks.' Olivia's followers can see the resemblance too and they regularly post comments on her pictures remarking on her likeness to Cara.

Along with her strong brows, pale blue eyes and similar nose and face shape, Olivia has an uncanny ability to copy Cara's signature silly photo faces. Cara loves to make her eyes pop, stick her tongue out or mug for the camera on social media. Now her South American lookalike has mastered the exact expression and has filled her Instagram feed with a mixture of Cara pics and her own impression of the model's face. Just like Cara Olivia has strong cheek bones and striking blue eyes . But Cara is not the only one with a looky-likey fan. Taylor Swift posted a picture of a fan named Morgan Jensen to her Tumblr earlier this week commenting on how she looked just like her. Taylor captioned the picture: 'Lol I thought that was me.' Morgan is a model and graphic designer from Flagstaff, Arizona,who regularly gets mistaken for the singer. Taylor Swift (right) brought untold joy to her newly discovered doppelganger  when she re-blogged this snap of her to her own Tumblr page (left) Something which she sometimes capitalises on, as she has been previously spotted pretending to be her outside her concerts. In fact, she once commanded a two-hour long queue of fans all of whom thought she was the Shake It Off singer. Morgan said of Taylor finding her picture: 'When I saw [Taylor] had re-blogged [shared] it I screamed and threw my phone and for the next six hours after that I was an ugly mess. 'Taylor is everything and the fact that she saw my face and thought it looked like hers - I died!'","Olivia Herdt from Uruguay looks startlingly like Cara Delevingne .

"Starbucks says it will start delivering to customers in select parts of Seattle and New York City later this year. The details will be discussed at the coffee chain's annual meeting Wednesday. In Seattle, the company said it will team up with a company called Postmates to deliver to homes and offices within specific areas. Coming soon: Starbucks says it will start delivering to customers in select parts of Seattle and New York City later this year . Postmates said on its website Wednesday 'With such incredible traction on their leading mobile payment app, Starbucks delivery by Postmates is an extension of what customers are looking for today, and provides a type of convenience that was never before available.' The company's CEO, Bastian Lehmann, told Re/code 'Speed is the number one thing. We’re actually working with Starbucks on trying to figure out what the best delivery containers are. 'Is there a packaging that we can develop together? Is there a cup that’s a better to-go cup?' In New York City, delivery will be from existing or newly setup Starbucks shops in certain buildings, starting with the Empire State Building. On Wednesday, Starbucks said in a news release that the service is called  the 'Green Apron' delivery choice. Starbucks Chief Digital Officer Adam Brotman told the Associated Press there will be no minimum purchase required, but that deliveries will require 'a small flat fee.' He declined to say what the exact fee will be. Delivery workers will accept tips, too. Brotman said the average time for deliveries will be 30 minutes, starting from when the order is placed. Speaking about the two programs, he told Re/code 'The truth is we’re not sure exactly how it will play out. Is one the national approach and one for dense urban environments only? We are truly in learning mode right now but we’re excited about them both.' For New York City, people will be able use a website to place orders. In Seattle, people would place orders via the company's mobile app. The hours of operation for delivery are still being determined. In the meantime, Starbucks Corp. also says it's on track for a national rollout of mobile order-and-pay, which lets customers place orders through its apps ahead of time so that drinks and food are ready when they arrive at the store. The program was launched in Portland, Oregon, late last year. Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw says the company expects to see a lift in sales as a result of mobile order-and-pay by late this year. Mobile order-and-pay will launch in Canada this year as well, and be tested in the United Kingdom, according to the company.

"Its affordable style is worn by everyone from Samantha Cameron to Rihanna - and in 2012 it became the most visited fashion website in the world for 18 to 34-year-olds. But as the Duchess of Cambridge - who is one of the most emulated women in the world - stepped out in a dress by ASOS this week, it proved how far the e-tailer has come from its humble beginnings in 2000. The Duchess dressed her bump in a spotty £35 wrap dress from the virtual high street on a visit to the Brookhill Children's Centre in London's Woolwich on Wednesday. In the past year, ASOS’s share value has doubled  with millions of fashion fans rushing online to snap up its daily new drops. So where did it all begin for the booming brand? Scroll down for video . The royal seal of approval: The Duchess of Cambridge dressed her bump in a spotty £35 wrap dress from ASOS on a visit to the Brookhill Children's Centre in London's Woolwich on Wednesday, so how did the e-tailer take off so quickly? The site was founded in 2000 by Nick Robertson and Quentin Griffiths under the name As Seen On Screen. With the founder of Austin Reed for a grandfather, it seems that Nick was always destined for a career in fashion. Nick, who attended private school, Canford, got two Ds and an F in his A-levels - which he confessed were 'diabolical' - and spent a brief period as a ‘ski bum’ in Meribel, France, before joining advertising firm Young & Rubicam and Carat. How things started: It was founded in 2000 by Nick Robertson, and Quentin Griffiths under the name As Seen On Screen and they poached buyer Lorri Penn, centre, from Sir Philip Green's Arcadia to help them get in touch with what customers wanted . Entrepeneur: Nick, who attended private school, Canford, got two Ds and an F in his A-levels and spent a brief period as a 'ski bum' in Meribel, France, before launching the site . In 1996, he and friend Quentin Griffiths set up Entertainment Marketing, which made money by getting brands featured on soaps. Four years later, they launched ASOS with £2.4million, mostly borrowed from friends and family. The duo's original idea was to help customers track down the clothes and furniture seen on TV. Nick explained: 'We read a stat back in 1999 that when the programme Friends aired, NBC got 4,000 calls about some standard lamp in one of their apartments asking where it could be purchased. So that was the real idea behind the business.' They poached buyer Lorri Penn from Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia to help them get in touch with what customers wanted and focused solely on celebrity fashion by selling near-matches of what stars were wearing. By 2003, ASOS was already in profit and had launched its own label. Early days: Nick Robertson, CEO of internet-based fashion retailer ASOS, is flanked by models Gia, left, and Alice at the company's north London office prior to the announcement of preliminary results back in the early 2000's . Star seller: Nick Robertson was awarded an OBE for Services to the Fashion Industry during an Investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace and sales for the financial year ending 31 August 2013 were £753.8m . It went on to expand into beauty and big brands started getting on board after it became the first UK fashion retailer to launch a moving images ‘catwalk’. In 2007, ASOS Magazine launched with 400,000 copies sent out to customers a month and cover stars including the likes of Taylor Swift. Then, the e-tailer branched out into menswear and the following year, retail sales jumped 90 per cent while profits leapt 117 per cent. Sales started pouring in after the site offered next day delivery, and it widened its target audience by introducing Designer Brands at ASOS with a new range of high-end labels on board. Just like us: Samantha Cameron wore a £42 ASOS on the final day of the Conservative Party Conference with her husband, Prime Minister David Cameron, in 2013 . From digital to print: In 2007, ASOS Magazine launched, with 400,000 copies sent out to customers a month with cover stars including the likes of Taylor Swift . Most visited fashion site in the world: Today, the site still sells its own label and 850 other brands and is visited by nearly 100m people a month . By 2011, ASOS  went multi-channel, multi-lingual and  joined forces with social networks as international sales soared by 142 per cent, with dedicated sites for countries all over the world. In 2012, offices were opened in New York and Sydney and later in Berlin and Shanghai. Today, the site still sells its own label alongside 850 other brands, and gives boutiques the chance to sell new and pre-worn fashion through its Marketplace channel. Writing about the e-tailer's success on its site, ASOS say: 'When we said we wanted to be ""truly global"", we meant it. In the year when we took over as the number one most visited fashion website in the world, per day, by 18-34 year olds, we opened our first international offices - and we have plans for more.' Sales for the financial year ending 31 August 2013 were £753.8m and ASOS PLC had an estimated net worth of £159m. Its  website attracted 98m visits during December 2014. It seems that the rise of ASOS really is unstoppable.

"An Italian policeman has gone on trial in Padua on allegations he lured young women to his home, including a teenage Australian girl, through a couch-surfing website and then drugged and sexually abused them. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year prison term for Dino Maglio. An Australian girl, 16, says she was abused by Maglio, 25, while she stayed at his house. Boris Dubini, who represents the teenager, says Maglio's claim that the sex was consensual was nonsense given the tranquiliser he gave her turned her into a 'rag doll' and she couldn't resist. Maglio is being held in a military prison and was not present for Tuesday's hearing. The policeman is accused of using the name of Leonardo on Couchsurfing.com to entice the girl, who was travelling with her mother and sister, prosecutors say. It has been claimed that Italian police officer Dino Maglio (pictured) used the name of Leonardo on Couchsurfing.com to entice a girl, who was travelling with her mother and sister . The 35-year-old has admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was under-age and could be sentenced to seven years prison if convicted . Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liqueur belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason' He had admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was under-age. But since the allegations were made, more than a dozen women have come forward claiming they were assaulted by the same man, after using the host-a-traveller website to arrange accommodation. The case has raised safety concerns surrounding the social networking site, which puts travellers in touch with hosts who are willing to put them up and show them around their home-towns for free. It has been linked to several alleged sexual assaults over the years, including the rape of a Hong Kong tourist in Leeds, according to the Guardian. The website's chief executive, Jennifer Billock, told the newspaper users' safety was a top priority and it was constantly 'evolving our tools and processes to find and halt abusers of our system'. It is believed that Maglio had told one alleged victim he closed his profile because he had so many positive reviews he had to open a new one. The Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPO), which carried out a year-long investigation, said that 14 testimonies collected revealed a man who seemed like a fun and fast-living host. Some claim he would constantly compliment them and insist they drink while they were out together and on the first or second night say they were served drinks of tea or wine. They did not report feeling unsafe as they were not travelling alone but in separate incidents from March 2013 until March 2014, the women recalled feeling suddenly 'woozy and intensely tired'. Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liqueur belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason'. He told investigators the sex was consensual and that he had joined Couchsurfing to improve his English, as he believed it would help further his career. Dino Maglio used Couchsurfing.com to entice a 16-year-old girl to his home before drugging her and raping her, it has been alleged. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year jail term . More than a dozen women have since come forward after finding his profile on the social network and staying at his flat in the picturesque city of Padua in northern Italy . In a victim statement, one Canadian woman alleged she had tried to rouse three other female visitors staying at Maglio's after she discovered them passed out before falling unconscious herself. She added that she had hazy memories of being kissed and fondled by Maglio but was unable to protest. Others feared they had been slipped the drugged and were unsure if anything had happened while they were passed out. Three young woman from Czech Republic also said they had been unable to recall what happened after staying at the defendant's home and drinking his wine. They claim they had brief flashes of being kissed and touched by Maglio and vomited when they woke up. Another traveller from Hong Kong claimed she was unconscious after drinking his alcohol and posted a negative review on his Couchsurfing profile. The next day he allegedly sent her a threatening message over Facebook demanding she remove it and said that if she refused he would use his authority as a police officer to create 'trouble' for her on her next visit to Europe. 'It took me some days to realise I was sexually abused,' the alleged victim told IRPI. 'So I wrote to him on Facebook. I asked him what happened and he admitted we had sex. I felt like a whore. I felt nobody would ever want me again after this.' The alleged attacks came to light after the women connected on the website to share their experiences. When his home was searched officers found a gun and a large amount of pornography and child abuse images, according to the Guardian. Court papers showed he was also hosting two other Couchsurfing tourists at the time - with one showing the same 'sickness' as other alleged victims. Maglio is being held in a military prison for his own protection and police chiefs say he has been suspended from duty. The next hearing in the fast-track trial is April 14.

"Parry is considered one of the country's most influential musicians and a key architect of the 19th Century English Musical Renaissance . The first known works by one of Britain's finest composers, Sir Hubert Parry, who wrote the music for Jerusalem, are being sold at auction. The 70 documents, expected to fetch up to £50,000, represent Parry's earliest surviving work and include pieces written when he was an Eton schoolboy and at Oxford. Many of the pieces have never been played in public, but a premiere before the Prince of Wales, a champion of Parry's music, is to take place in May. Parry is considered one of the country's most influential musicians and a key architect of the 19th Century English Musical Renaissance. As well as Jersualem, he wrote many famous settings for English hymns, including Repton, a well-known tune for Dear Lord And Father Of Mankind. Parry's setting of the anthem I Was Glad has been played at the Coronations of every Monarch since Edward VII and was performed at the Westminster Abbey wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, as well as the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in 1981. In a BBC4 documentary about Parry's music, Charles said: 'It gives you tingles up the spine and tears in your eyes.' Parry's version of The Magnificat And Nunc Dimittis In D, and an anthem entitled O Sing Unto The Lord, are considered the best of the cache and will be sung for the first time by the choir at Gloucester Cathedral. Leading institutions and potential buyers, including Prince Charles, have been sent details of the auction at Chorley's, Gloucester, on May 19. It is an appropriate venue because Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (1848-1918) grew up just two miles from Gloucester, where he learned to play the organ. Leading institutions and potential buyers, including Prince Charles, have been sent details of the auction at Chorley's, Gloucester, on May 19 . Adrian Partington, the cathedral's director of music, who examined all the manuscripts and chose the two pieces for the premiere, said: 'The pieces are beautifully well-written for his age and show a talented young composer, but they are not exceptional. I think he was writing stuff for his chums to perform at Eton and Oxford and he did it in a hurry. 'They were probably only performed informally around the piano and I suspect he just forgot about them, which is why they have been gathering dust for all these years. 'But the seeds of a great composition like Jerusalem can be found in this student work. These are beautifully shaped tunes, logical harmony and very exact but imaginative setting of the words.' Some are incomplete or jottings, but there are some important compositions which until recently were kept in storage by one of Parry's distant relatives. In later life, Parry went on to teach and later run the Royal College of Music in London, which has an archive of his work. Dr Peter Horton, a librarian at the college, said: 'The new documents are interesting because they are his early works and one can see from them how Parry's work developed.'","Works of Sir Hubert Parry, one of UK's finest composers, to be auctioned .

"A mental health patient was held in a police cell for almost two days because there were no beds available at nearby hospitals, it has emerged. The patient is one of almost 200 people in Wiltshire held by the county's police force in the last two years because there was no suitable healthcare provision. Meanwhile across the UK last year, 7,000 people with mental health problems ended up being held in police cells. Of those, 236 children and young people were detained alongside criminals. Mental health experts have branded the practice 'shameful', adding it highlights the fact there are not enough suitable crisis beds across the country. A mental health patient in Wiltshire was held in a police cell for almost two days because there were no suitable mental health hospital beds available (file picture posed by model) A Freedom of Information request, submitted by the Swindon Advertiser, reveals the longest holding period in the last two years was 37.5 hours, while a 16-year-old was detained for eight consecutive hours. Ninety-four people were detained in Swindon and Wiltshire in 2013 and in 2014, the figure was 95. Condemning the practice, which is seen across the country, Mark Winstanley, chief executive of mental health charity, Rethink Mental Illness, told MailOnline the situation must change. 'It's scandalous and shameful that thousands of people with mental health problems, including children, are being locked up in police cells because they can't get the care they need,' he said. 'That has to change, because it's costing lives. 'The real problem is that there simply aren't enough suitable crisis services across the country, and where they do exist, they are badly underfunded and overstretched. 'We need much greater investment in crisis care, so that anyone experiencing mental health problems can get quality emergency support close to home, whenever they need it. 'We also want to see more funding for early intervention services, to help people avoid reaching crisis point in the first place. 'Without this urgent reform and investment, the mental health system will continue to fail people when they are at their most vulnerable.' Dr Peter Carter, chief executive  of the Royal College of Nursing told MailOnline the practice is just one of the 'detrimental consequences' of severe cuts to mental health services. He said: 'Mental health trusts have had their budgets cut by eight per cent over the last five years, losing 1,500 beds and 3,300 nurses in the process. 'Given these ongoing reductions in funding resources it is no wonder that trusts are struggling to cope. Across the UK last year, 7,000 people with mental health problems ended up being held in police cells, according to mental health charity Rethink Mental Illness . 'Mental health services are under immense pressure, not just in Swindon and Wiltshire, but across the UK. 'The Government promised the equal treatment of mental and physical health but this situation has illustrated just how far this equality currently is from fruition. 'Nurses and other mental health professionals are working tirelessly to provide their patients with high standards of care, but without a rapid increase in funding, resources and understanding, some of the most vulnerable members of society will continue to be failed by the health service.' The responsibility for caring for mental health patients in the county falls to the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership. But when there is a shortage of beds, the police force has step in. Wiltshire Police told the Advertiser its policy is not to put patients in cells, but staff are often left with no other choice. A spokesman said the force signed the national Crisis Care Concordat last year, a national agreement between services and agencies involved in the care and support of people in crisis. He said: 'It specifically states that police officers should not have to consider using police custody as an alternative location if there is a lack of local mental health provision. However, in practice this does still occur but is rare and seen by police as a last resort.' The AWP said the opening of a new unit at Southmead Hospital, in Bristol, would help prevent similar situations in future. A spokesman told the Advertiser: 'The unit has been used by 1,000 people and we have received some great feedback. 'The Place of Safety unit is very well run and is nursing led with medical input. The nursing team focus on giving the service user the least traumatic experience possible and also address their physical health.' Mental illness accounts for 23 per cent of the total impact of ill health in the UK, but gets only 13 per cent of the NHS budget. In addition mental health trusts in England have seen their budgets fall by more than eight per cent in real terms over the course of this Parliament.","Almost 200 mental health patients detained in police cells in Wiltshire .

"For more than 16 years the International Space Station and its team of astronauts have given us unprecedented access to breathtaking and awe-inspiring sights of our planet. And now the current crew, on Expedition 42, has created a collection bringing together some of the most stunning images of Earth's landscapes. From the glittering lights over the English Channel to the sand dunes in Oman and the concrete nature of New York, the world's varied landmarks have been recorded from on board the orbiting craft. Scroll down for video . The Rub' al Khali, also known as the 'Empty Quarter', is the second largest sand desert in the world. It has distinctive dune formations and covers 250,000 square miles (650,000 square kilometres) including regions of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen . The current Expedition 42 crew on ISS has created a collection of images taken from the station of landscapes on Earth. One of the most striking photos shows the glittering lights of the south coast of England and the north coast of France, taken above the English Channel in January (pictured). It shows concentrations of light in major towns and in the distance a green light that looks like the Northern Lights glows . All of these images form part of the Nasa: Landscapes by Samantha Cristoforetti collection. Ms Cristoforetti is one of six astronauts on board the station as part of Expedition 42. Her colleagues include commander Barry Wilmore, flight engineer Terry Virts and Russian cosmonauts Elena Serova, Alexander Samoukutyaev and Anton Shkaplerov. The expedition began on 9 November last year, when Expedition 41 undocked and they are due to return in May. One of the most striking images in the collection shows the glittering lights of the south coast of England and the north coast of France, taken above the English Channel in January. It shows concentrations of light in major cities and towns and in the distance, on the curvature of the Earth, a green light that looks like the Northern Lights glows. A second image was taken above the big island of Hawaii in the North Pacific Ocean. It was captured on 28 February and the peaks of volcanoes Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea can be seen in the centre of the 4,028 square mile (10,432 square kilometre) land mass. Mauna Loa is the world's largest, and one of its most active, volcanoes . The expedition also captured the contrasting and dense landscape of New York City. The grey, concrete-coloured image is in stark contrast to the vibrant blues of the ocean. In particular, the midtown areas of Manhattan are so populated and compacted that the buildings look almost black. Larger, more open spaces of airports including John F Kennedy can just be distinguished . The entire International Space Station was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit last month so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station. The remarkable manoeuvre saw a European spacecraft ‘slow’ the speed of the station. This changed the height of its orbit  by about 1.6 miles (2.5km), before the station was spun back again to its original position. A second image was taken above the big island of Hawaii in the North Pacific Ocean. It was captured on 28 February and the peaks of volcanoes Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea can be seen towards the centre of the 4,028 square mile (10,432 square kilometre) land mass. Mauna Loa is the world's largest, and one of its most active, volcanoes. It doesn't erupt as frequently Kilauea, but when it does eruptions produce rivers of lava that have threatened the nearby town of Hilo. It rises almost 5.5 miles (9km)  and almost 90 per cent of its surface is covered by lavas less than 4,000 years old. From the relatively remote island of Hawaii, the expedition has also captured the contrasting and dense landscape of New York City. The grey, concrete-coloured image is in stark contrast to the vibrant blues of the ocean. Further west, Ms Cristoferetti captured this image above Yosemite National Park in California. The snow-topped mountains in the region, including Mount Dana, Mount Lyell and Mount Warren are shown. The small lake in the bottom of the picture is called Mono Lake with Paoha Island in the centre. The park covers a staggering 1,190 square miles (3,081 square kilometres) During its orbit over Africa, the crew captured the coastline of Mozambique (pictured). The coastline is rocky and jagged, especially near Baia De Sofala, and its total coastline stretches for 4,313 miles (6,942 km) David MacLean from the GIS FacultyCentre of Geographic Sciences (COGS), told MailOnline this image of Earth shows the Bahamas, in particular Long, Acklins and Crooked Islands, Cuba to the left and Florida to the right of centre .

The park covers a staggering 1,190 square miles (3,081 square kilometres). During its orbit over Africa and heading across the Middle East and into Asia the crew captured the coastline of Mozambique, Kazakhstan and Tamgaly, and Pakistan. The coastline of Mozambique is rocky and jagged, especially near Baia De Sofala and its total coastline stretches for 4,313 miles (6,942 km). Elsewhere in Africa, Lake Kariba between Zambia and Zimbabwe is shown, photographed from almost 250 miles (400km) in orbit around the Earth. It is the world's largest manmade lake and reservoir and was filled in the early 1960s after the Kariba Dam was completed. Tamgaly is a petroglyph site in the Semirechye, Kazakhstan, around 74 miles (120km) to northwest of Almaty. The majority of the 5,000 petroglyphs are in the main canyon and are mostly from the Bronze Age. The name Tamgaly in Kazakh means 'painted or marked place' and the region became a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2004. Over Pakistan, Ms Cristoferrti photographed the Indus River Delta - an area of the South Asian country where Indus River flows into the Arabian Sea. On either side of the delta are Keti Bunder South Wildlife Sanctuary and Marho Kotri Wildlife Sanctuary and the dry arid region receives between 10 and 19 inches (25 and 50cm) of rainfall a year. The delta is home to mangrove forests as well as  the Indus Dolphin. The crew also captured distinctive dune formations of the Rub' al Khali, also known as the 'Empty Quarter. It is the second largest sand desert in the world and covers 250,000 square miles (650,000 square kilometres) including regions of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

The International Space Station marked its 10th anniversary of continuous human occupation on 2 November 2010 and since Expedition 1 in 2000 the space station has been visited by more than 215 people. As of November 2014, there have been 100 Russian launches, 37 space shuttle launches, one test flight and three operational flights by SpaceX’s Dragon as well as a test flight and two operational flights by Orbital Science’s Cygnus. A total of 184 spacewalks have been conducted in support of space station assembly totaling over 1,152 hours, or approximately 48 days. The space station, including its large solar arrays, spans the area of a U.S. football field, including the end zones, and weighs 924,739 pounds. The complex now has more livable room than a conventional six-bedroom house, and has two bathrooms, a gymnasium and a 360-degree bay window.","The International Space Station will celebrate its 15th anniversary of continuous human occupation in November .

"President Barack Obama is in 'denial about the threats we face' and is 'making grave miscalculations' that threaten the safety of the global community, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry charged on Thursday morning while speaking at a breakfast in New Hampshire. Obama said in his State of the Union address that ISIS' advance had been stopped, Perry said. 'That is simply not true.' 'He says ISIS is not a religious movement. Again, he's simply wrong.' 'To deny the fundamental religious nature of the threat and downplay the seriousness of it is naive, it's dangerous, and it's misguided,' the self-described 'wannabe' presidential candidate said at a Saint Anselm College Politics and Eggs event. 'To deny the fundamental religious nature of the threat and downplay the seriousness of it is naive, it's dangerous, and it's misguided,' Rick Perry, a self-described 'wannabe' presidential candidate said at a Saint Anselm College's Politics and Eggs event this morning. Perry is pictured here at a summit in Iowa last Saturday . Perry was the guest speaker this morning at the breakfast for major presidential hopefuls that the historic college lauds as a 'must-stop' event on the campaign trail. Photo courtesy of NH1: http://www.nh1.com/ . If the leaders of Jordan and Egypt recognize 'that we are at war with radical Islam, isn't it time that our president admitted the same?' Perry asked. 'The fact is we didn't start this war. We didn't choose it, but we need to have the will to finish it.' Perry was the guest speaker at the Bedford, New Hampshire, breakfast for major presidential hopefuls that the historic college lauds as a 'must-stop' event on the campaign trail. Other maybe-presidential candidates who have headlined the event in the 'First in the Nation' state so far this year are former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose appearance came earlier this week on Monday. Famed in presidential politics as the second state to hold a presidential contest every four years and the first one to hold a primary - Iowa, the first state to vote, holds a caucus - New Hampshire is a popular destination for would-be contestants for the Oval Office. The speech was an opportunity for Perry to flex his muscles and explain why he'd make a better commander in chief than close to a dozen other Republicans flirting with national campaigns. But at the end of the event, possibly unaware that his mic was still hot, the Texas Republican revealed that he was being coached on foreign policy by his friend - and likely presidential candidate - Graham. Asked to sign what appeared from a distance to be a program of this political season's Politics and Eggs speakers, Perry announced that he would sign his name next to Graham. 'Lindsey's my buddy. I am a big Lindsey Graham fan,' Perry disclosed. 'I think he's one of the most knowledgeable people that we have on foreign policy, and we, we need to listen to him. He is a very, very bright United States senator, who is ....you know he's carved out his niche, and it is foreign policy.' Continuing, Perry said, 'I talked to him night before last, just...picking his brain a little bit about what's going on in Ukraine, in particular...[Russian President Vladimir] Putin is, is a dangerous guy. 'And this strategy of kind of strategic patience with him, I don't think is wise,' Perry added, still talking about Putin. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday. Perry, possibly unaware that he was still being recorded,  admitted today that the Senate Armed Services committee member - who is plotting his own presidential bid -  is advising him on foreign policy . Obama said in a December interview with National Public Radio that he'd learned throughout his nearly six years in office the value of 'having some strategic patience' when it comes to Russia. 'You’ll recall that three or four months ago, everybody in Washington was convinced that President Putin was a genius and he had out maneuvered all of us,' Obama stated. 'I said at the time we don’t want war with Russia but we can apply steady pressure...being the backbone of an international coalition to oppose Russia’s violation of another country’s sovereignty, and that over time this would be a strategic mistake by Russia. 'And today, you know, I’d sense that at least outside of Russia, maybe some people are thinking what Putin did wasn’t so smart,' the U.S. president proclaimed. Perry, still miked up, said he doesn't ascribe to the Obama administration's theory that the slump in oil prices and economic downturn in Russia will crack Putin. 'You gotta remember the '90s and how bad it got in Russia,' Perry told an admirer. 'It's not anywhere near as bad as that now.' Perry asserted that Putin has 'like $386 billion of reserves' of oil and gas money that he put aside. 'It's actually a lot better now, and so, trying to wait him out is not a good strategy,' he said. Spelling out how he'd handle Russia's aggression, Perry said, 'I think you have to fund the lethal weapons to the Ukrainian military.' 'You take the SWIFT banking ability from him,' he said, referring to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, and international banking system, and 'go after the 1,000 people or so that actually run Russia and have all the money' - the oligarchs. Then, Perry said he'd 'flood Europe with liquifed national gas.' 'And that would really bring him to his knees.' Keynote speaker of a Monday Politics and Eggs program, Graham signs wooden eggs for guests at the political speech series in Bedford, New Hampshire . A spokesman for Perry did not immediately return the Daily Mail's request for clarification on whether the former Texas governor and 2008 presidential candidate knew he was still being broadcast when he made the remarks about Graham and Putin. Graham, a  defense hawk and member of the Senate Armed Services committee who is building his presidential bid around his foreign policy credentials, has also been critical of Obama's 'strategic patience' claims. 'I doubt ISIL, the Iranian mullahs, or Vladimir Putin will be intimidated by President Obama's strategy of ""strategic patience,"" ' Graham said last month in response to Obama's announcement that the mantra would drive his national security strategy moving forward. 'From their point of view, the more ""patience"" President Obama practices the stronger they become,' he said in a statement. 'The Obama Doctrine, or ""strategic patience,"" has led to a world in chaos.' 'Applying more ""patience"" to President Obama's failed foreign policy just prolongs failure.'","President Obama is in 'denial about the threats we face' former Texas Gov.

"A mother has spoken of her fury that the 26-year-old Briton who beat her daughter to death during a lovers' row on a Greek island had his sentence slashed. Luke Walker was found guilty of GBH leading to the death of his then-girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman, 20, while the couple were working in Crete in May 2010. He was handed an eight-year suspended sentence in May 2013 which has now been reduced to a three-year suspended jail term after a retrial at Heraklion Mixed Criminal Court in Crete. Miss Hyndman's mother Heather, 50, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, has branded the sentence as 'ridiculous' and said 'it's just not right'. Luke Walker was found guilty of GBH leading to the death of his then-girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman (pictured together in Crete) 'It was horrendous having to relive it all again and having to listen to how my daughter died,' she said. 'A lot of the time I had to go outside the courtroom because I just couldn't listen to any more. 'Then for him to get a three-year suspended sentence is just ridiculous. People get bigger sentences for selling drugs. 'How can he be allowed home when he has killed someone? It's just not right.' Miss Hyndman was admitted to hospital in Heraklion, Crete, with abdominal pains in May 2010 and died the following day as a result of acute peritonitis. Walker - an electrician who was living in the resort town of Malia where he and Chelsea worked in bars - claimed she fell during a night out on May 6. Miss Hyndman (pictured both) was admitted to hospital in Heraklion, Crete, with abdominal pains in May 2010 and died the following day as a result of acute peritonitis . Witnesses told the court they heard shouting and furniture being moved in the couple's room a few days before she died . She fell over on a cobbled street, landing with her left hand under her body near her stomach area, according to Louise Purdy, who had been with her on the night out. The court heard that as the night wore on she told friends she was okay but had hurt her stomach a little. Lyndsay Williamson, who had been friends with Miss Hyndman since 2007, said that by May 11 she noticed a difference in Miss Hyndman. They had both spent time at the beach and had got badly burned by the sun and later that day, when the pair met up to go for a few drinks, Miss Hyndman 'seemed so out of it and disorientated'. Miss Williamson saw her again on May 12 and said Miss Hyndman was being sick and had stomach cramps and thought she had sunstroke. Miss Hyndman met Walker while working in the resort in 2008 and they returned to the island in the summer of 2009 . The couple had only been in Malia for three weeks before Miss Hyndman died in hospital . She briefly saw her again as she was going into hospital and asked if she wanted her to go too. Miss Hyndman replied: 'I just want to be with Luke', the court heard. In the early hours of  May 12, the couple  arrived back at their apartment and Miss Hyndman became irritated with Walker because he began cooking and she was feeling nauseous, the court heard. They had a 'little bicker', Walker said, and she went out. He assumed she had gone to a friend's nearby apartment. Asked by the judge if he had pushed her, if she had banged against any furniture, or if he had hurt her, he replied 'No'. 'You're saying categorically, adamantly, no?' Walker was asked. 'No, I didn't,' he said. Witnesses told the court they heard shouting and furniture being moved in the couple's room on that night. Walker denied the murder of his 20-year-old girlfriend and during a retrial in May 2013 the charge was reduced to grievous bodily harm leading to Chelsea’s death. Ms Hyndman said: 'It was four days before anybody took her to the doctor or got any sort of medical help. 'She was just sitting in her room getting constantly worse. I still dont understand why nobody phoned us because just one phone call could have saved Chelsea's life. Miss Hyndman's mother said it was four days before anybody took her to the doctor or got any sort of medical help . Paying tribute to her daughter, Ms Hyndman said: 'Chelsea was happy, bubbly and very outgoing' 'The end of the court case offers a little bit of closure because there is nothing he can to do appeal it. 'But I still don't know the full facts about what happened and I don't think I ever will. 'Nothing will ever bring Chelsea back either and not a day goes by where I don't think about her.' Miss Hyndman met Walker while working in the resort in 2008 and they returned to the island in the summer of 2009. The couple had only been in Malia for three weeks before Miss Hyndman's death. Ms Hyndman's partner, Neil Lorriman, 37, said: 'This has been going on for almost five years now and during that time we have had to travel to and from Crete and compete with the language barrier which has not been easy. 'It has been a fight all the way through to understand everything which just made the whole situation worse. 'This retrial ending is like the closing of a chapter but I dont think it will never end for good.' Paying tribute to her daughter, Ms Hyndman said: 'Chelsea was happy, bubbly and very outgoing. We used to go shopping together a lot and she was more like a friend than a daughter. 'The last thing I said to Luke before they went to Crete was take good care of Chelsea. That's something that will stay with me forever because this is the last thing I thought would happen.' Ms Hyndman was told her daughter was ill by a policeman in May 2010. She booked a flight to Crete with Walker's father but it was cancelled due to the ash cloud caused by a volcano in Iceland. 'When I was waiting for the disruption to clear I got a phone call to say that Chelsea had died. I can't put into words how difficult that was,' she said. 'I just keep thinking that I've got Mia, who's 11 now, and that helps. Chelsea will never be forgotten and I can see her in Mia. 'They are very similar and that's really nice because it's like I've still got a bit of Chelsea with me. 'We would like to thank family and friends for all the help and support they have given us over the past five years.'","Luke Walker found guilty of GBH leading to the death of Chelsea Hyndman .

"It could be the most hi-tech road trip ever attempted. Delphi Automotive is set to attempt what it bills as the 'longest automated drive ever attempted in North America' The 3,500-mile coast-to-coast excursion will take place in a specially rigged Audi SQ5 that will mostly drive itself. Scroll down for video . The Delphi drive will kick off March 22 near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, with plans to wind up in New York City just before the annual auto show opens there on April 3. The Delphi drive will kick off March 22 near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, with plans to wind up in New York City just before the annual auto show opens there on April 3. During the coast-to-coast journey in the Audi, at least two Delphi engineers will be aboard, including one behind the wheel. Delphi, one of the largest suppliers of automotive electronics and safety systems, is using the long journey in the Audi crossover to acquire real-world data from a sophisticated array of cameras, radar and lidar - a laser mapping technology - as well as wireless connected-vehicle technology. The firm also wants to test and demonstrate its active safety systems, which are being developed with such suppliers as Mobileye NV, an Israeli maker of computer vision and collision avoidance systems, and software provider Ottomatika, a spinout from Carnegie Mellon University's self-driving car program. Delphi's demonstration underscores growing interest and investments by automakers and suppliers in self-driving cars, some of which could be production-ready by 2020. The Delphi drive will kick off March 22 near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, with plans to wind up in New York City just before the annual auto show opens there on April 3. Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, sees the automated driver assistance systems in the Audi as building blocks on the road to fully self-driving cars in the next decade. During the coast-to-coast journey in the Audi, at least two Delphi engineers will be aboard, including one behind the wheel. Delphi, a former General Motors Co unit domiciled in the UK, will test such functions as traffic jam assist, automated highway pilot with lane change and automated parking and valet. All of those systems are expected to be introduced in production cars over the next two to three years. Although automakers and suppliers will have such capability within the next five years, Owens said, 'our view is that the driver is going to be in the seat for a long time' in case of emergency situations that self-driving systems may not be equipped or programmed to handle.

Delphi is providing some of the components and technology, including vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, for GM's Super Cruise automated driving system, which will debut in 2016 on the new Cadillac CT6 sedan. During the cross-country trek, the vehicle will be challenged under a variety of driving conditions from changing weather and terrain to potential road hazards -- things that could never truly be tested in a lab. 'Delphi had great success testing its car in California and on the streets of Las Vegas,' said Owens. 'Now it's time to put our vehicle to the ultimate test by broadening the range of driving conditions. 'This drive will help us collect invaluable data in our quest to deliver the best automotive grade technologies on the market.'","Drive will start March 22 near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge .

"An anguished daughter has begged her father to reveal where he hid her murdered mother's body, three decades after he carried out the horrific crime. After 30 years of silence, 71-year-old Russell Causley has finally opened up about the murder of Veronica Packman, who disappeared from her family home in Bournemouth in June 1985. For 11 years, Causley had concocted a false story about his wife's whereabouts. But, after being investigated by police for a separate insurance scam, Causley was convicted of her murder in 1996, despite Ms Packman's body never being found. A daughter is urging her father Russell Causley, 71 (left) to reveal where he has hidden the body of her murdered mother Veronica Packman (right) Now Samantha Gillingham, 46, is begging for her depraved father to reveal the whereabouts of her mother's body, as the 30th anniversary of her disappearance approaches. The former aircraft engineer had suggested meeting with the family so he could finally reveal what had happened - but he cancelled the confrontation, just days before it was due to go ahead. Mrs Gillingham said: 'It is my father who approached us to speak, we responded to listen to what he has to say, only for him to cancel four days before. 'I am asking for help; I need to ask once again if there is anything that someone knows, who has not previously come forward for whatever reason - please rethink on your silence.' Ms Packman, 40, and Causley - both wealthy, middle-class aircraft engineers - had been having several marital problems when she went missing. Mrs Gillingham, then 16, later discovered a scrawled note from her mother saying she had left and wanted no further contact with the family. It came 12 months after Causley had moved his mistress Patricia - a colleague - into the family;s Ipswich Road home, under the pretence that she needed somewhere to stay. Following Ms Packman's disappearance, Causley changed his name by deed poll from Packman to Causley, the surname of his lover. Samantha Gillingham (left), who was 16 when her mother (right) disappeared, said she needs to know where her mother's body is so she can gain closure on the horrific incident . The family lived a respectable, middle-class life in Bournemouth, Dorset, until Causley (centre) moved his mistress Patricia into the family home, 12 months before Ms Packman (left) disappeared . He then created a cover story about Ms Packman's disappearance, to convince friends and family she was still alive. Mrs Gillingham believed her mother had abandoned the family. But 11 years later, Causley was jailed for two years after he tried to fake his own death in a boating accident in a million-pound insurance scam. Ms Causley was also handed a 12-month suspended sentence for conspiring to defraud. But, more importantly, the investigation led detectives to reopen the case into Ms Packman's disappearance. Causley was then charged with her murder before being convicted in 1996 at Winchester Crown Court. It was one of the first UK cases where  a murder conviction was secured without a body being found. Causley's conviction was quashed on appeal in 2003 but he was found guilty again at a retrial the following year. He then concoted an elaborate story about where Ms Packman had gone, to convince friends and family she was still alive. Pictured: Ms Packman (left), Causley (centre) and Mrs Gillingham as a child (right) While in prison, Causley confessed to three inmates that he had killed his wife. He is also said to have told one that he gassed her before dissolving her body in acid. He then made further admissions in August last year, at which time Mrs Gillingham and her family were given hope that he would tell them everything, in exchange for being moved to a lower-category prison. But six months later, that promise has still come to nothing. Mrs Gillingham added: 'For the first time I am asking if there is anyone with legal or forensic ability who would be able to offer their professional services or who would be able to finance such services. 'I feel acutely embarrassed to ask for something where I am unable to pay. I need to find my mother. My mother did not deserve this.' Mrs Gillingham (pictured with her father during a family holiday in the 80s) wants those with legal or forensic skills to be able to help in the search . Meanwhile, Mrs Gillingham's 26-year-old son Neil called his grandfather 'scum' and said he continues to 'rip the family apart with his malicious poison'. He said: 'He hasn't engaged, he continues to take the same arrogant, obnoxious stance and although he admits his guilt I feel this is a ploy to gain early release without giving closure. 'He continues to rip our family apart with his malicious poison. My grandfather is a dangerous man, this has now been confirmed. 'I want answers fast, I need support and I want to ask for support from those who can make a change.' He added: 'I want to appeal for anyone with forensic experience to assist me in finding the missing pieces in that jigsaw - those with technical knowledge, lawyers, politicians, anyone who may have known something - to come forward. Mrs Gillingham's son Neil, 26, (right) said his grandfather was 'scum' and has 'ripped the family apart' 'I am determined to make a change, this is unacceptable that a convicted murderer can continue to torment and systematically destroy my family with such disregard from behind prison doors. 'He is scum and we should be supported to ensure that we put a stop on this from continuing. He should die behind bars.' Detective Inspector Mark Samuel from Dorset Police said: 'I can't begin to imagine the frustration felt by the family. Since the parole hearing we've re-interviewed Causley in prison and revisited the address at Ipswich Road and we're grateful for the co-operation of the current owners and neighbours. 'I would like to emphasise how determined we are to find closure and get to the truth in this matter. 'Only one person holds the key to this, Russell Causley holds all of the information and we too appeal to him to invite us to come and speak to him. 'There are powers in place that allow us to meet with him, but it needs his willingness to physically talk.' Causley is at HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire and is due to face the parole board again this summer.","Veronica Packman, 40, went missing from her Bournemouth home in 1985 .

"Murdered in prison: Carlos Manuel Perez Jr., 28, was handcuffed when he died from multiple gunshot wounds to the head, neck, chest and arms . A Nevada prison inmate was handcuffed when was shot and killed by a guard last November, according to a lawyer who said Wednesday that her client was wounded in the same shooting but survived. Carlos Manuel Perez Jr. was slain with his hands cuffed behind his back, attorney Alexis Plunkett said. Inmate Andrew Jay Arevalo was also handcuffed and 'miraculously survived three shotgun blasts to the face,' Plunkett said. 'This is what I clearly consider to be an excessive use of force,' she said in an email to The Associated Press. Plunkett said she represents Arevalo, not Perez, and plans to sue the guard, prison officials and the state. 'This is a terribly tragic and completely unnecessary shooting,' Plunkett said. Clark County Coroner Michael Murphy said Wednesday that he ruled Perez's death a homicide from multiple gunshot wounds to the head, neck, chest and arms. Murphy noted his ruling meant Perez, 28, died at the hands of another person. It didn't establish fault. Nevada prisons chief Greg Cox said in a statement issued after the coroner's ruling became public that Arevalo and Perez were fighting when a guard at High Desert State Prison opened fire. Policy and procedure were followed in contacting the coroner, Las Vegas police and the prisons inspector general, Cox said. The Department of Corrections director didn't mention handcuffs and didn't identify the guard. But he said the shooter was one of three correctional officers who remain on administrative leave pending completion of a Nevada Department of Investigations report and a review by the state attorney general's office. Patty Cafferata, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, said the case will be evaluated and appropriate action will be taken. Laxalt's office also could be called on to defend the state in wrongful-death and excessive-force lawsuits. A spokeswoman for Gov. Brian Sandoval referred questions about the case to Cox. Perez and Arevalo were being housed separately in a disciplinary wing, known as 'the hole', where inmates are handcuffed behind their backs when they are outside their cells, and no more than one inmate is usually allowed out of a cell at the same time, Plunkett said. 'Procedure was followed because Perez and my client were both handcuffed,' the attorney said. 'But procedure was not followed because they were out of their individual cells at the same time. Scene: Perez and Arevalo were in the 'hole', or administrative segregation, at High Desert State Prison in Indian Springs, Nevada, in November, when they started fighting. Both were handcuffed, but prison guards opened fire on each. Perez died and Arevalo survived . Plunkett added: 'Obviously, in light of the shooting, the procedural violation is the least of the issues.' Plunkett said she has talked with an attorney for Perez's family. But she declined to identify the attorney. 'This was not a riot,' Plunkett told The Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'There was no threat to a CO. There was not threat to any other inmates.' Perez's younger brother, Victor Perez, 30, said the family were not properly told what happened to his sibling. Three days after he died, they visited his body in the mortuary and were shocked to see it riddled with bullets. 'We had to undress him ourselves to take pictures of his wounds,' Mr Perez told The Review-Journal. 'Everything was hidden from us.' Deputy Clark County Public Defender Claudia Romney represented Perez when he pleaded guilty in December 2012 in Las Vegas to battery causing substantial bodily harm, but she doesn't represent him now. Records show that Perez was sentenced in February 2013 to 18 months to four years in prison. Police said he hit a man in the head with a two-by-four piece of lumber while man was walking with his daughter and son on a downtown Las Vegas street. Perez was previously convicted of felony domestic battery for choking his girlfriend nine months after their baby girl was born. He was sentenced in May 2010 to one to three years in state prison. Arevalo, 24, pleaded guilty in June 2013 in Las Vegas to burglary and was sentenced in August 2013 to two to six years in prison. Prisons officials issued a 78-word statement the day after Perez died saying he had been in prison since March 2013, that an autopsy and investigation would be conducted, and that no further details about his death were available at that time. The statement didn't say Perez had been shot or that Arevalo had been wounded. At the state Legislature in Carson City, elected officials were surprised Wednesday to learn that a prison guard shot and killed an inmate a full 19 weeks earlier. Assemblyman Ira Hansen, R-Sparks, chairman of the Assembly Judiciary Committee, said it was the first he heard of the case. Assemblyman James Ohrenschall, D-Las Vegas, a committee member, said he wanted to know what happened. 'There needs to be more of an investigation,' said Assemblywoman Marilyn Kirkpatrick, the Democratic Assembly floor leader.","Carlos Manuel Perez Jr. was  serving an 18-to-48-month sentence for battery .

Scroll down for video . Green and pleasant land: The small town of Hawes in North Yorkshire enjoyed fine weather yesterday as temperatures soared . All white: And the same scene last week after heavy snowfall blanketed the surrounding farmland after a blast of wintry weather . Have the barbecue on standby as forecasters predict we may enjoy a better-than-usual spring. The UK experienced the hottest day of the year on Saturday, with Santon Downham in Suffolk reaching 63F (17C), hotter than Barcelona and Rome. Meanwhile the highest temperature yesterday was the 15.4C (59.7F) observed in Charsfield, Suffolk, while London saw a decent 13C (55.4F). Yesterday, however, a storm system moved in from the Atlantic, bringing with it a series of weather warnings. The wettest place in the country yesterday was Achnagart in the Scottish Highlands, which had 1.17in (29.6mm) of rain - mostly in the early morning. This week we can expect frosty mornings, severe gales and prolonged rain. Met Office forecaster Chris Page said: ‘It will bring strong winds, especially in the North. 'There is the potential for some heavy rain and the chance of some snow too in Scotland. The whole country will experience wet and windy conditions.’ High winds: A yellow ‘be aware’ severe weather warning has been put in place from 9am today until 9am tomorrow over all of Scotland . On the way: Storm clouds over Tynemouth, although western and central parts of Scotland are also expected to see the heaviest downpours . Dark skies: Isaac Hughes, four, passes one the Kelpies 100ft high horse-head sculptures at the Forth and Clyde Canal in Falkirk yesterday . There will be a brief respite on Tuesday when the sun returns, but then the miserable weather will continue until Thursday. From next weekend, however, a spell of high-pressure will take hold across the country. In a three-month contingency forecast for March to May, the Met Office said that above-average temperatures and dry weather are likely. But it did add that the forecasts are only broad predictions. The previous record for this year was set two months ago in Exeter, Devon, when temperatures reached 16.5C (63.5F) on January 9. But the sun was not enjoyed by all - with western parts of Scotland experiencing wet weather - and the warm conditions are not expected to last. Happy: Claude, a three-week old Valais Blacknose lamb, with four-year-old Evie Duncan and her brother Bertie, two, at Whitehall Farm in Dumfries, south-west Scotland. The rare lamb had its leg broken at birth, but is now being nursed back to health and has the limb in a cast . On the beach: These sun-seekers made the most of the warm weather on Sunday on Southwold beach in Suffolk . Umbrellas and coats: People take shelter when they visit the Kelpies  horse-head sculptures at the Forth and Clyde Canal in Falkirk on Sunday . A yellow ‘be aware’ severe weather warning for wind has been put in place from 9am today until 9am tomorrow over the whole of Scotland. The alert - which also covers the far north of Northern Ireland – advised that gusts could hit 80mph in exposed parts of western and northern Scotland. Western and central parts of Scotland are also expected to see heavy downpours, with up to 7.87in (200mm) of rain forecast over 36 hours. The worst-hit area on Saturday was Cluanie Inn in the Scottish Highlands, which suffered 4.37in (111mm) from midday Friday to midday Saturday. Elsewhere in the Highlands, the rain affected football - with a waterlogged pitch postponing Inverness Caledonian Thistle's match with Raith Rovers. The Scottish Cup quarter-final tie at the Caledonian Stadium was put off on Saturday due to ‘incessant rain throughout the night’, the club said. On the south coast: Clouds over Eastbourne Pier in East Sussex on Sunday, as the warm weather is set to give way to high winds and rain . Stunning scene: A huge flock of starlings fly in front of the West Pier during sunset in Brighton, East Sussex, on Saturday evening . Saturday in Brighton: The country basked in hotter weather than Barcelona, Rome and Athens, with temperatures hitting a high of 17.5C . Meanwhile there was an Environment Agency flood alert in place yesterday for the North Sea coast at Bridlington in East Yorkshire. But in the South on Saturday with spring finally appearing to have sprung, thousands headed outdoors to enjoy the warmth. Sun-seekers flocked to Hampton Court Palace in south-west London and the sandy beach at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. In central London, swarms of bees feasted on nectar and pollen in St James's Park, where temperatures rose as high as 16.7C (62.1F). Speaking of the week ahead, forecaster Craig Snell said: ‘Temperatures will return to around average, with highs of 10C (50F) to 11C (52F).' He added that this was 'still not cold', but stated: 'Next week will see quite changeable weather but nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year.’","UK had hotter weather than Barcelona, Rome and Athens at the weekend - with the mercury hitting 17.5C .

"On his bike? Jeremy Clarkson went on a cycle ride today as he prepares to find out of he is sacked by the BBC over a 'fracas' with a Top Gear producer over a steak . Petrolhead Jeremy Clarkson appeared to be preparing for life after Top Gear today by shunning his car and choosing to go for a bike ride instead. The star, 54, decided to cycle on the streets around his west London home this morning on the eve of an BBC internal report that will help decide whether he is sacked. He smiled and waved to photographers but his future at the BBC looks increasingly bleak after a series of Top Gear Live tour dates worth £1million to the corporation were axed. The four roadshows scheduled for Norway next weekend were scrapped. Tickets for the postponed shows cost between £42 and £100, meaning the decision could cost the BBC more than £1million in lost revenue if Clarkson is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled. Speculation that the BBC was desperate to find a way of keeping Clarkson – and the lucrative Top Gear brand – had been supported by the fact that the Norway tour was not cancelled despite the frontman’s recent suspension. But last night a spokesman for the live shows, due to be attended by almost 20,000 people, announced the March 27 and 28 dates were being ‘postponed’. ‘Top Gear Live regrets to inform ticket holders for next week’s shows in Stavanger that we will be postponing all four performances,’ he said, adding that new dates would be announced at a later time. The corporation's commercial arm rakes in an estimated £50million a year from selling the rights to Top Gear overseas, with the show watched in 214 countries around the world. The motoring programme is also set to make around £7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the UK this year. The conservative estimate is based on 15,000 tickets sold for each show at the cheapest price of £35 each, however with more expensive tickets and VIP packages available, this figure could be far higher. Car manufacturers are also thought to pay to have their cars featured on the stadium tours. Organisers confirmed that this weekend’s shows had been scrapped, but insisted they were not privy to the outcome of the inquiry into Clarkson. Big decision: Sacking Clarkson could mean the end of Top Gear, which makes the BBC millions every year . A source said: ‘This is an independent decision we have to make. It is no indication of what is to come. One of Top Gear Live’s main presenters remains on suspension by the BBC and the expected timeline on the conclusion of that investigation does not give us enough confidence that we can deliver the show expected by fans [and] ticket holders.’ It emerged today that a report into Clarkson's behaviour was commissioned by BBC head of TV Danny Cohen after a series of other scandals last year. Top Gear caused an international incident after driving through Argentina with a number plate allegedly linked to the Falklands War  and used the word 'slope' describe an Asian man. A report into the cases apparently concluded that Top Gear should have a new producer role to act as a go-between the show's team and the BBC's management to help deal with any future crisis. The BBC today refused to comment on the report or its conclusions. Clarkson was suspended by the BBC two weeks ago, following allegations of a ‘fracas’ with producer Oisin Tymon over hot food. His fate now hangs on an internal report by Ken MacQuarrie, head of BBC Scotland, which is expected to be handed over today. A source said: ‘The BBC wants to keep Clarkson if it can find a respectable way to do it.’ A senior executive added: ‘The BBC will do everything it can to keep him if it was just a bit of a dust-up, but if he is found to have punched him, then I think it’s gone too far.’ Insiders suggested Clarkson and Mr Tymon had given ‘quite different’ versions of events. Sources close to Mr Tymon say he was punched and left with a split lip, while Clarkson has admitted some ‘handbags and pushing’ but is understood to have denied anything worse. Clarkson, pictured with co ho-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at a Top Gear Live show in Prague, will not be performing at the four events in Norway as they have been cancelled . The four roadshows scheduled for Norway next weekend were scrapped, on the eve of an internal report into Clarkson’s fate . Clarkson was suspended by the BBC two weeks ago, following allegations of a ‘fracas’ with producer Oisin Tymon (left) over hot food . The BBC is set to lose as much as £67million a year if Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson is sacked over claims he punched a producer. The corporation's commercial arm rakes in an estimated £50million a year from selling the rights to Top Gear overseas, with the show watched in 214 countries around the world. On top of that, BBC Worldwide makes millions more from Top Gear Magazine and live shows in the UK and abroad, as well as sales of DVDs. The BBC could lose tens of millions of pounds in annual profit if they do give Clarkson his marching orders, with the sale of the show overseas making £50million. Top Gear Magazine has a global circulation of 1.7m, bringing in another estimated £7.4million - not including profit from advertising, as well as the costs of producing and shipping the magazine. The motoring programme is also set to make around £7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the UK this year. There is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear – worth £50million a year to BBC coffers – off the air while the investigation was under way. ‘The programme could and should have carried on during Clarkson’s suspension,’ said an insider. ‘Jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings. ‘He has a great deal of public support... But he does need to rest and sort himself out.’ The stakes were raised further yesterday as the 54-year-old reportedly promised to sue the BBC if he was sacked from Top Gear. It comes amid suggestions that the corporation is filming a pilot for a new motoring show called The Getaway Car, which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges. A source told the Sunday Mirror: ‘If Clarkson is fired it won’t be the end of it. Lawyers will be involved.’ Writing in the Sunday Times, Clarkson also laughed off a foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses filmed at a charity auction last week, claiming he only used the language ‘in jest’ to raise money for good causes. A petition to have Clarkson re-instated on Top Gear has gathered around one million signatures and was delivered to the BBC in London on Friday. A decision about his future is expected this week, after the corporation’s director-general has considered the findings of MacQuarrie’s investigation.","Four Top Gear Live shows in Norway next weekend have been scrapped .

"When a man tragically died shoveling snow from his roof, the first responders who arrived just too late to save his life decided to finish the job in his memory. Miroslaw Dabrowski was removing the build up of snow above his New England home when the 57-year-old suffered a heart-attack, the New York Daily News reported. A relative he invited over to assist him called 911 when he arrived, but the Manchester Fire Rescue EMS and the city's police department did not reach him fast enough. Kindness: Miroslaw Dabrowski died shoveling snow from his roof so the emergency responders (picture) who arrived too late to save his life finished the job in his memory . Good deed: The first responders (pictured) finished the job for Mr Dabrowski - who had a heart attack on his roof - so the family would not be worried about their home's structural integrity . Fire Chief David Billings told Daily News: 'Quite often a situation like this leaves first responders frustrated and feeling somewhat helpless. They felt going back and finishing the job would at least have a positive outcome for the family. 'They just wanted to do something for the family so when they got home they wouldn't have to worry about the integrity of the house.' The emergency services used a ladder to reach the collapsed man on the roof but failed to revive him, Billings added. The father of three was brought back down and taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. A few hours after being contacted, a dozen members of the rescue service and police department returned to his home and finish Mr Dabrowski's shoveling duties in his memory. And Dabrowski's wife Teresa told the Hartford Courant the family was touched by their efforts, saying: 'He would be very appreciative that someone was looking out for his family. We are all grateful to them.' Even though it deviates from their usual job description, Billings said the responders like doing something to comfort a bereaved family during such terrible moments. He said: 'I certainly support them doing that. I was proud of their actions.'

"Fired: Visual arts teacher Traci Gauthier was let go by St Vrain Valley school district last week after posting a picture of freshman Phoenix Bowen on Instagram . A Colorado visual arts high school teacher has been fired after posting a picture of a student on her Instagram account. Traci Gauthier was substituting for a different class in Skyline High School in Longmont, Colorado, when she posted a photo of freshman Phoenix Bowen as he walked out of the room. The caption of the photo read: 'STEM kids are trying too hard. I don't know him, but I hate him. #pothead #STEM #wannabecool #dorkywhiteboy'. Phoenix became aware of the picture after his friend showed it to him after class. 'You can't hate me, you don't know me,' he commented on the post. Gauthier was quick to respond, saying, 'I know I don't know you-but I can hate anyone I'd like. #Nobig #Dontbesad #MeanArtTeacher.' Phoenix thought the most offensive part was the hashtag accusing him of being a pothead because 'It's false,' he told FOX31. He said Gauthier was probably making a reference to his backpack, which has a logo of the energy drink CannaEnergy on it. The company's logo includes a hemp leaf, though there's no THC in the drink. 'People automatically see the hemp leaf and assume it is a pot leaf and pot is ""stoner"", and that's not what it's about,' Phoenix told FOX. Words hurt: The caption of Gauthier's photo read, 'STEM kids are trying too hard. I don't know him, but I hate him. #pothead #STEM #wannabecool #dorkywhiteboy' Phoenix's father Erich Bowen said that he's worried about his son, who is usually outgoing. 'I can see a difference in Phoenix's attitude and the way he's handling himself,' he told FOX31. 'This is bullying. This is a lot of lines crossed.' St. Vrain Valley School District told FOX31 that it did not have a social media policy for teachers and said on Thursday that Gauthier was no longer employed. The district's school board president Bob Smith said the photo could be seen as a threat to student welfare, according to Denver Post. Crossed the line: Phoenix's father, Erich Bowen (left) says Gouthier's Instagram post should be considered bullying that targeted Phoenix (right) Not a stoner: Phoenix said he was offended by Gauthier's '#pothead' hashtag, because he says 'it's false'. His backpack has an energy drink logo on it that includes a hemp leaf . 'We would take bullying from anyone absolutely seriously, and particularly from a teacher,' he said. 'Student wellbeing is our number one priority. Without a strong sense of wellbeing, students can't learn.' In April of 2014, Gauthier appeared to share that stance on bullying when sent a letter to board members addressing the district's policy. 'Something as simple as having announcements and fliers around the building can dramatically improve the climate of anti-bullying in a building and make kids feel safer,' wrote Gauthier, who was one of the school's gay-straight alliance advisers. 'That is the beauty and power of advertising. Presidents, senators, school board members, etc. win campaigns because of visibility. Students and staff can only feel safe if the group is VISIBLE.'","Traci Gauthier posted a photo of freshman Phoenix Bowen in classroom .

"An outspoken, liberal multimillionaire congressman from Florida believes his 24-year marriage should be annulled because his estranged wife 'committed bigamy'. Rep. Alan Grayson, 56, whose pretrial hearing was likened to an episode of the Netflix drama 'House of Cards', is set to make claims in court on Monday that his wife, Lolita, was still married  when they wedded in Virginia in 1990. The outspoken liberal gained national attention during the debates over health care reform when he said the Republicans' opposing plan was 'don't get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly.' Alan, a Democrat and highly successful trial lawyer, said his wife's marriage to Robert Carson was not dissolved until 1994 in Broward County, Florida. However, she claims she divorced Carson in Guam in 1981, and she also disputes that she was divorced in Broward County. If the marriage is annulled, Alan would avoid having the court divide personal property or decide whether he owes Lolita  alimony - his worth is listed by her at $31 million, according to court papers. An outspoken liberal congressman from Florida believes his 24-year marriage should be annulled because his estranged wife 'committed bigamy' (above 56-year-old Rep. Alan Grayson pictured during a House Democrats' new conference in January) Besides bigamy, the divorce has featured mutual allegations of battery, accusations by Lolita of financial abandonment by the congressman and a trial delay caused by her leaking breast implants. Last year, it was reported that Lolita was approved for public assistance by the state of Florida to help feed her four minor children that she has with Alan, according to WFTV. It was shortly after he was named the 17th richest man in Congress. Lolita has claimed she is not the 'Lolita B. Carson' cited in a dissolution of marriage final judgment that Alan said is proof that she was still married to Carson when they wed. Neither side has found Carson. During a recent pretrial hearing, when attorneys were arguing over who had access to the couple's financial documents, Circuit Judge Bob LeBlanc likened the scenario to the well-known Netflix political drama. He said: 'This is starting to sound like 'House of Cards"".' If the marriage is annulled, Alan would avoid having the court divide personal property or decide whether he owes Lolita alimony - his worth is listed by her at $31 million, according to court papers (above 2005 picture of Alan Grayson with his daughter, center,  Lolita, right, and John Edwards, left) Attorneys at the hearing suggested that politics, in part, may be preventing any effort to reach a quiet, confidential settlement that the judge hinted is the best option for the Graysons, who are the parents of five children. 'When lies are told about you and you're in the media, your detractors are going to use it and use it forever more. You have to neutralize that and the only way to do that is to get the truth out,' said Mark NeJame, one of Alan's attorneys. Alan, whose divorce case is likened to an episode of the TV show 'House of Cards', is set to make claims in court on Monday that his wife, Lolita, was still married when she and the multimillionaire congressman married in Virginia in 1990 (Alan, right, and his estranged wife Lolita, left, pictured in an undated photo) When the judge said that both sides had 'calmed down' from the initial acrimony of last year's divorce filing, NeJame shot back, 'except the Republican Party.' Lolita' attorney, Mark Longell, said the congressman was going to 'drag her through the mud' so that he does not look bad. Longwell, who only got the case within the past month, is her third attorney. He requested a trial delay so he could have more time to prepare, and the judge will consider another delay Monday. The trial will move ahead if the judge decides against it.","Rep.

"Undergoing oxygen treatment in a pressure chamber, this is a survivor of the deadly explosion at a Ukrainian coal mine that killed 33 people. Andrei Serebrennikov, who was exposed to dangerous levels of methane, is being treated at the Regional Hospital of Occupational Diseases in Donetsk after the incident on Wednesday. The last missing miner was found dead tonight, following the blast that happened before dawn more than 3,200ft underground at the Zasyadko mine in the city. Scroll down for video . Oxygen treatment: Andrei Serebrennikov (left) was exposed to dangerous levels of methane in the explosion . Medical help: He is being treated at the Regional Hospital of Occupational Diseases in Donetsk after the blast . Assistance: Mr Serebrennikov is undergoing an enriched oxygen treatment in a pressure chamber in Ukraine . Severe injuries: Doctors operate on another miner who survived the explosion but suffered extensive burns . It is the largest city held by the separatist rebels who have been fighting Ukrainian forces since April. Rebel officials said the accident was caused by methane gas. Zasyadko mine has a history of deadly accidents, including one in November 2007 that killed 101 workers, and two more the following month that killed a total of 57. Although the latest gas explosion was not directly caused by the fighting, miners say war may have contributed to the death toll. Other parts of the mine had been damaged in the past by artillery strikes, which cut off access routes and may have made escape more difficult for those trapped below ground. Band of brothers: Ukrainian coal miners carry the body of a colleague killed in the explosion on Wednesday . Elevator: The miners board a lift going underground to help search for colleagues and clear up debris . Response: A Ukrainian mining rescuer holds a stretcher after taking part in the search for bodies of miners . Another survivor, Ivan Lazarenko, lay in hospital yesterday - still unconscious and in bandages. If he recovers, it would be the second time this year he had escaped death at the mine. He was trapped once in a lift when the mine was hit by incoming fire, his wife Tatyana Kosenko said. She added: ‘I was getting ready for work and they called me to tell me he was in the burn centre, but was alive and well. Somehow this is considered to be “well”. Of course, thank God, he's alive.’ Were it not for the war between Russia-backed separatists and the Ukrainian authorities, Eduard Kiporov, one of those missing and presumed dead in the blast, would not have been working at all at Zasyadko. Miners: The blast happened before dawn more than 3,000 feet underground at the Zasyadko mine . Shock: A Ukrainian coal miner looks out from the cabin of a truck loaded with seven of his colleagues' bodies . Underground work: An Ukrainian mining rescuer boards a bus after taking part in the search for bodies . He took the job only because the mine where he normally worked, Oktyabrskaya, was bombed several months ago. ‘They constantly shot at this mine. They went into that mine every day and had no idea whether they would come back out or not, either from artillery fire or some accident,’ said his sister Julia. The area near the Zasyadko is littered with the debris of missiles, a short distance from the graveyard where victims of previous disasters are buried and where fresh graves had been dug for those killed in Wednesday's blast. Last July, a bus carrying miners to work in Krasnopartizan in Luhansk Province was struck by fire from Grad rockets killing four people and injuring 16 miners. A Ukrainian soldier has been killed and another wounded fighting pro-Russian separatists in the east, military officials said yesterday. It came as Kiev accused rebels of increasing violations of a ceasefire deal, which President Petro Poroshenko has described as the last chance for peace with the pro-Russian rebels. Meanwhile haunting photographs showed 23 Ukrainian soldier's bodies being transferred back from pro-Russian rebels to Ukraine. Another loss: A coffin sits discarded and leaning up against a fence behind a morgue in Donetsk, Ukraine . Moving: Volunteers reclaim 23 Ukrainian soldier's bodies from pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk yesterday . Accusations of continued violence on both sides show the fragility of the peace accord agreed in Minsk last month, which calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the frontline. Some 6,000 people have been killed in fighting since separatists took up arms last year in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, in response to the overthrow of the Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in Kiev. Interior Ministry adviser Zoryan Shkiryak said the rebels were not failing to  pull back, and also building up forces in southern Donetsk, near the Ukrainian-held port city of Mariupol. He said: ‘They are not withdrawing arms, they are not observing the ceasefire, they continue to relocate units and increase their number of tanks and rocket launchers.’ The military said rebels had attacked Ukrainian troop positions or civilian targets 40 times in 24 hours, including 17 artillery attacks. The rebels accuse Ukrainian forces almost daily of firing. Grim task: Workers and Red Cross members load bodies of Ukrainian soldiers near the Donetsk city morgue .

The conflict has plunged ties between Russia and the West to Cold War-era lows as Kiev, along with the United States and the European Union, say they have evidence that Moscow is arming the rebels and boosting their ranks with regular army soldiers. Russia has repeatedly denied the accusations and accused the United States of pushing Kiev's pro-Western government into conflict with its own people. Ukraine's army, which has gained experience in fighting with separatists, will also be trained by foreign advisers. ‘We will provide military trainers to the Ukrainian Armed Forces,’ Britain’s Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told journalists after his meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart in Kiev.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"First-time parents Kate and David Ogg were heartbroken when they were told one of their twins - born two minutes apart at just 26 weeks - had stopped breathing and had just moments to live. Thinking it was the only time they would have with the tiny boy they had already decided to name Jamie, Kate asked to be able to hold the lifeless child, and told David to climb into the hospital bed for a tender embrace. What happened next was nothing short of a miracle. Scroll down for video . When Kate and David Ogg were told their newborn son Jamie had passed away on March 25, 2010, they took him in their arms and cradled him to keep him warm . Jamie and Emily are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story . In this mother's loving arms, the little boy started moving, and his breathing grew stronger. Hospital staff rushed back to his aid and together brought the baby back to life. Five years on, Jamie Ogg is a healthy, happy kid whose biggest problem regarding his troubled entry in the world is having a little brother who tells anyone who'll listen that he used to be dead but now he's alive. After years of trying to fall pregnant, the Queensland couple were delighted to find out they were having twins - the 'pigeon pair' of a boy and girl. But just six months into the pregnancy they found themselves in the delivery room and facing premature births. Jamie was born first on March 25, 2010 and his sister Emily followed two minutes later. 'They were both born in their sac but Jamie didn't make a noise when they tore it open. Emily let out a big wail,' Ms Ogg told Daily Mail Australia. 'We looked over and everyone was crowding around Jamie - there was about 20 people in the room. The vibe wasn't very good. When they were told the devastating news, Kate ordered her husband to take off his shirt and get into the bed to provide extra warmth - and miraculously he gasped for air and opened his eyes . Doctors worked on Jamie for 20 minutes before they stopped and informed his heartbroken parents . The doctor sat on the end of Ms Ogg's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out . After birth, skin-to-skin contact is recognised as a simple step mothers can take to welcome their baby into the world. For Kate and David Ogg the point is all the more pertinent. The birth process is a stressful and exhausting time for the baby. Unicef advises mothers to hold their child in skin-to-skin contact to help their baby 'adapt to their new environment'. It means their 'heartbeat and breathing will be better controlled' and there is a wealth of evidence that suggests babies held in skin-to-skin contact are less stressed by the birth process. Unicef's advice states: 'We know that babies who have spent an hour in skin contact are significantly less stressed after the birth experience - this means their breathing and heart rate are more stable, they cry less, and when they start to feed, they digest their food better. 'A mother's chest area is significantly warmer than other parts of her body - ready to welcome her new baby and prevent them from cooling down - which is a significant risk. 'Your baby has been lovely and warm in your uterus - at around 37 degrees, whereas the labour room will be significantly cooler, and he is wet – it’s like getting out of the swimming baths, you need to get dry and warm quickly.' Meanwhile Caroline Davey, chief executive of the premature baby charity, Bliss, echoed the importance of skin-to-skin contact. She said it is 'an essential part of family-centred care and should be part of the care that all babies receive'. Ms Davey added: 'Evidence shows that it can help to regulate the baby’s heartbeat, lower their stress levels and can play an important role in improving the positive outcomes for premature babies.’ 'He stopped breathing and his heartbeat was nearly gone. After 20 minutes they stopped working on him.' The doctor sat on the end of Ms Ogg's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out. He then informed them that there was nothing more they could do to save Jamie. 'I saw him gasp but the doctor said it was no use. I took Jamie off the doctor, asked everyone to leave. He was cold and I just wanted him to be warm,' she said. 'We had tried for years to have kids and I felt so guilty. I just wanted to cuddle him. I unwrapped him and ordered my husband to take his shirt off and climb into the bed. 'I know it sounds stupid, but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so I wasn't going to give up easily. 'I know it sounds stupid, but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so I wasn't going to give up easily,' Mrs Ogg said . 'We were trying to entice him to stay. We explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him,' Mrs Ogg said . 'He suddenly gasped... then he opened his eyes. He was breathing and grabbing Dave's finger,' Mrs Ogg said . 'We were trying to entice him to stay. We explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him. 'He suddenly gasped... then he opened his eyes. He was breathing and grabbing Dave's finger. 'If we had let the doctor walk out of the room with him, Jamie would have been dead.' Jamie and Emily are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story. 'Emily burst into tears, she was really upset and she kept hugging Jamie,' Ms Ogg said. 'They love to talk about when they were babies. 'They have a little brother Charlie who loves telling anyone who listens. He'll say: ""When I was born I was fat and the twins were skinny. Jamie was also dead but now he is alive"".' Emily and Jamie also have a little brother Charlie, 4, and regularly talk about their miracle birth story . Remarkably, Jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth . When the twins were first told of their miracle birth, Emily burst into tears and wouldn't stop hugging Jamie . The Ogg family have set up an online community called Jamie's Gift to regularly raise funds for the Miracle Babies Foundation - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns . Remarkably, Jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth. 'He is absolutely fine... the biggest concern they had was cerebral palsy because of the lack of oxygen but there's been nothing,' Ms Ogg said. 'It's absolutely astounding. This whole experience makes you cherish them more.' The Ogg family have set up an online community called Jamie's Gift to regularly raise funds for the Miracle Babies Foundation - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns. Dave is currently training for an Ironman triathlon in Port Macquarie in May to raise funds. 'He will put his body through a gruelling 3.8km swim, 180km bike and a marathon,' Ms Ogg said.

"A top American dog handler has caused outrage by picking up her championship winning Scottish Terrier by its tail at a British show. Rebecca Cross, who won Best in Show at Crufts last weekend, was filmed picking up her Scottish terrier Knopa by its neck and tail - an act she says was 'just habit'. Now Cross, a mother-of-one and military veteran from Glen Burnie, Maryland, is at the center of a campaign calling for her to be stripped of the prestigious accolade. More than 100,000 people have signed a petition following the competition, which has already seen more than its fair share of scandal. Scroll down for video . Animal lovers have accused the Crufts organisers of 'turning a blind eye' after footage emerged showing U.S competitor Rebecca Cross picking up her Scottish terrier Knopa by its neck and tail . Nearly 100,000 people have now signed an online petition, calling for Ms Cross to be stripped of her prestigious title . The Kennel Club explained that it had warned Ms Cross not to pick up the dog in that manner but that it was 'customary' to do so in the U.S . 'Strip Rebecca Cross of her Best In Show award at Crufts 2015 for her unduly harsh handling of the Scottish Terrier, Knopa,' the petition reads. 'Under KC Rule A42 I believe that Ms Cross is guilty of ""behaving discreditably and prejudicially to the interests of the canine world"" and should be held accountable.' The British Kennel Club, the organizers of the show, which was held in Birmingham, said it had warned Cross not to pick up the dog in that manner but that it was 'customary' to do so in the U.S. Knopa beat over 21,000 dogs to be named Best in Show at the competition. After the footage emerged of Cross handling her dog, Crufts issued an almost immediate apology. Cross also issued an apology, saying she 'didn't do it on purpose, it was just habit'. She added: 'It's just one of those things. It happened and I tried to really think about it and not do it, but it's habit.' The petition claims Ms Cross (right), whose prize-giving was interrupted by an anti-Crufts campaigner (left), is guilty of ‘behaving discreditably and prejudicially to the interests of the canine world’ Ms Cross (pictured in the arena) apologized, saying she 'didn't do it on purpose, it was just habit' Veteran: Her Facebook page shows Cross, who has a baby daughter, previously served in the military . Cross, who lived in Japan for four years and now resides in Maryland where she breeds different types of pedigree dogs, has bred and owned Scottish Terriers for two decades. She has previously won multiple Best in Shows, according to an online bio, and also works full-time for a consulting group in Maryland, according to her website. Despite her apology, the anger towards her continued to grow, with the petition gaining nearly 100,000 in less than 12 hours. It claims  Ms Cross is guilty of ‘behaving discreditably and prejudicially to the interests of the canine world’. But, in a second statement, the Kennel Club said it would not be 'fair' to strip the dog of its Best in Show title, solely due to the  behavior of its owner. A Kennel Club spokesman added that, although there was 'clear guidance' that dogs should not be handled in this way, it would be reviewing its procedures in light of the incident. Jagger, who is co-owned by Belgian Aleksandra Lauwers and Leicester-based breeder Dee Milligan-Bott, died in his owner's arms on Friday, after returning home to Belgium . Scandal: The owner of this chamption Myter, Eye to Eye, also believes the dog was deliberately poisoned after she was found vomiting and shaking in pain shortly before it was due to be judged on Friday . The Scottish Terrier was initially bred as a working dog by farmers to eradicate vermin and hunt small animals underground. It has a very long and strong tail which owners traditionally used to pull it out of holes. It is not said to hurt to pick them up in this way. They were introduced into America in the early 1890s and it was not until the years between World War I and World War II that they became popular. They have been owned by a variety of celebrities, including the 32nd President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose Scottie ""Fala"" is included with FDR in a statue in Washington, DC, as well as the 43rd President George W. Bush. They said: 'We completely understand the concerns about how Knopa, the Best in Show dog, was handled on the judging table. 'A decision will be made by committee about what action may be taken within the current rules and guidance. In this specific case an investigation is underway and a decision will be made by committee about the actions that have been taken by the exhibitor at Crufts and the next steps. 'The judge’s primary focus is on the dogs themselves and we do not believe it would be fair to strip the dog of its Best in Show title because the dog was awarded this prize based on its own merits in the show ring.' It added: 'Prior to this incident the guidance related to handling has been followed by those showing their dogs but in light of this situation we will be reviewing our rules and guidance and how they may need to be amended going forward. This is the latest incident are the latest controversies to hit the world famous competition. Earlier this week, it emerged that six dogs who took part in the competition had been reportedly poisoned, including Irish setter Jagger, who died at his Belgium home on Monday. The RSPCA confirmed it was investigating allegations that an overseas competitor had mistreated his dog outside the showground, pictured .","Rebecca Cross, a mother-of-one and military veteran from Maryland, caused outrage at British dog show last weekend .

"David Cameron today joked he had doubled the security around Larry the Downing Street cat after the 'murder' of a dog at Crufts. The Prime Minister attacked the 'unbelievable awful' killing of the award-winning Irish setter Jagger, who was killed by poisoned meat allegedly fed to him at the dog show. He said he could not understand how anyone could poison a family dog and quipped that he would ramp up security around Number 10's resident cat. Prime Minister David Cameron today joked he had doubled the security around Larry the Downing Street . Mr Cameron, speaking to Heart radio, insisted he was not overly concerned about the safety of Larry. He said: 'He doesn't get up and get out much. I think he's probably pretty safe sitting on the chair of the hallway watching the world go by.' But he added: 'I'll double the security around him and make sure he's okay.' Mr Cameron's remarks come after the grief-stricken owners of Jagger said his death had left their nine-year-old son devastated, as they shared a series of heart-breaking photographs of the dog. The PM said: 'I can understand as a dog and cat lover myself, my heart goes out to a family who sees that happen. 'I remember listening to the owner on the radio talking about the toxicology report and how they had found lumps of meat which had poison in, you think who would go to such a length, who would do that? It's an unbelievably awful thing to do.' The Prime Minister attacked the 'unbelievable awful' killing of the award-winning Irish setter Jagger . Irish setter Jagger died 24 hours after returning from Crufts, the world's most prestigious dog show. A second dog  is reported to have died after appearing at Crufts, amid fears that at least six of the animals were deliberately poisoned at the world famous show. The shih tzu is believed to have died over the weekend, just hours after the 'murder' of Irish setter Jagger. The three-year-old died on Friday after eating meat which his owners say was laced with poison. Today, Jagger's bereft co-owners are preparing to cremate the prize-winning dog at his rural home in Belgium, before scattering his ashes across a field where he used to love walking. It comes as the show's organisers, the Kennel Club, warned that anyone found putting the dogs' lives at risk could be prosecuted - a crime which can lead to 51 weeks in jail or a £20,000 fine. Jagger's Belgian owner Aleksandra Lauwers said she will join her husband and 'devastated' son, Jeremy, today in scattering the ashes of her second 'beautiful child.' Jagger (pictured) is one of six dogs who are believed to have been poisoned at the world-famous show . Jagger's owners are convinced the dog was the victim of meat poisoning. Pictured: Jeremy, now nine, runs Jagger round a competition field . Mrs Lauwers shook with emotion yesterday as she told the Mail 'To the person who has done this I would say: I hope you can sleep well knowing you have killed my beautiful child. 'He was our love, our family member and the very best friend to our son. We are still in a state of shock. 'My son is devastated. He does not know how somebody could be so cruel and do this to an innocent and helpless animal. Why would anyone want to cause Jagger such a slow and painful death?' She realised something was very wrong when Jagger's jaw dropped and he started to tremble after they returned from Crufts to their large detached family home in the quiet village of Lauw in east Belgium on Friday evening. Just 24 hours after Jagger and death a vet found cubes of meat laced with a slow-acting toxin in his stomach and the family contacted local police. Toxology tests will be completed by the end of the week which should determine the cause of death, amid suggestions they could be rat poison or slug repellents. Before then Jagger will be cremated.","PM said he could not understand how anyone could poison a family pet .

"Photos of Robert Durst taken as he was driven from a New Orleans courthouse on Tuesday showed the man looking remarkably different than he did over 10 years ago when he stood trial for the murder of Morris Black in Gavelston, Texas. The 71-year-old, who was charged with drug and gun possession by local authorities after being picked up on a first-degree murder warrant issued by the Los Angeles Police Department for the murder of his friend Susan Berman, who was shot dead in her home on Christmas Eve 2000, looked younger than he did back in 2003. Cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Kenneth Mark, who has offices in New York City, Aspen and the Hamptons, pointed out what work Durst possibly had done to achieve this new look. Scroll down for video . Photos of Robert Durst emerging from a New Orleans courthouse on Tuesday (right) showed the man looking younger than he did 10 years ago (left) A top cosmetic dermatologist has weighed in on the operations he believes Durst possibly had done - and he also appears to have had new dental work . They include eyelid surgery, Botox, a facelift and fillers . 'It appears that he's had upper and lower eyelid surgery (bleparoplasty), a facelift (rhytidectomy), Botox, especially on the outer edges of the eyes (crows feet), and also the filler Voluma in the mid face area particularly the malar aspect of the medial cheeks,' Dr. Mark told DailyMail.com. 'What this emphasizes is how multiple cosmetic procedures are synergistic and for the optimal cosmetic result, it's not just simply a matter of doing either Botox or filler or a procedure, but picking the best combination.' It also seems clear that Durst's teeth have changed, though it is not certain if he got veneers or dentures. If he did have the work done, it is not certain if it was for vanity purposes, necessity or to slowly alter his appearance. A search warrant that was recently released following his New Orleans arrest reveals that Durst had a latex mask in his hotel room and a fake ID. In addition, he had slowly been withdrawing thousands of thousands of dollars that officials now believe he planned on taking with him or mailing to himself once he fled the country. He reportedly had $100 bills stacked in numerous envelopes ultimately totaling $42,000 in his hotel room. This in addition to a quarter pound of marijuana. His upper eyelid appears to snap open much higher this week than it ever did twelve years ago . In 2003 a fold of skin nearly obscure his eyes, which were heavier lidded here in 2003 . It also seems clear that Durst's teeth have changed, though it is not certain if he got veneers or dentures . The arrest happened within hours of the finale of the documentary starring and about Durst, The Jinx, had its finale on HBO. In that finale Durst seems to admit in the final scene that he is responsible for murdering Berman, Black and his first wife Kathleen Durst. Durst will next appear in court on Monday, and is currently at the Orleans Parish Prison. Police searching Robert Durst’s Houston home on Tuesday found three crime-related books, according to a list of items recovered in the execution of a search warrant. Cops founds two copies of A Deadly Secret, a book about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's wife Kathie Durst and one copy of Without A Trace about Durst being acquitted in the 2001 death and dismemberment of his Galveston neighbor, Morris Black. Police also found seven credit cards, seven blank checks and five boxes containing court documents and news articles in his possession. He also had a trash bag filled with court transcripts.","Photos of Robert Durst emerging from a New Orleans courthouse on Tuesday showed the man looking younger than he did 10 years ago .

"A shocking report from investigators at the Social Security Administration has found that 6.5 million dead people are still listed on the benefit agency's rolls, listed at age 112 or older. Illegal immigrants and thieves are taking advantage, according to the SSA's Office of Inspector General. The IG set out to find out if death dates were being entered into computers for people who had 'exceeded maximum reasonable life expectancies.' If found millions who the government officially considered at least as old as the oldest living human currently alive. US Social Security numbers belonging to 6.5 million dead people were still listed as active – not deceased – when the Social Security Administration's inspector general investigated . YOUNG'UNS: Some of the still-active SSNs belonged to people who were born before teh US Civil War . Former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano launched the 'E-Verify' system in 2011, which screens out illegal immigrants during hiring, but some have been using still-valid SSNs belonging to dead Americans . Bureaucrats never added their Social Security Numbers to the government's 'Death Master File,' so it's possible benefits have been paid erroneously for decades. The Gerontology Research Group reported in October 2013 that there weer only 35 people on earth who were confirmed to be age 112 or older. The inspector general did not say how many benefit checks were sent to the 6.5 million Americans whose Social Security accounts should have been closed out years ago. But the IG's report, just one page in length confirms only that payments have been 'terminated' for 410,074 of the affected accounts. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton told Daily Mail Online in a telephone interview that he was outraged by the possibility 'that there are dead people getting government checks.' 'Now we've got 6.5 million walking dead,' he said, 'and frankly – are these Zombie Americans voting? are they working? Are illegal immigrants using their SSNs to get jobs?' Indeed, 'thousands of the SSNs could have been used to commit identity fraud,' the inspector general's report concludes. 'We obtained information indicating a man opened bank accounts using several different Social Security numbers,' according to the IG, which said two of them belonged to people born in 1869 and 1893.' And between 2008 and 2011, employers trying to screen out illegal immigrants during hiring submitted 4,024 'E-Verify' requests to the federal government representing 3,873 people who used SSNs that belonged to people born before June 16, 1901. WIsconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson told CNS News that it's 'incredible that the Social Security Administration in 2015 does not have the technical sophistication to ensure that people they know to be deceased are actually noted as dead.' Johnson chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee. The committee's ranking Democrat, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, noted that 'a few thousand' of the deceased people who still had active Social Security numbers were born before the Civil War. 'Preventing agency errors by keeping track of who has died is a relatively simple problem,' he said. 'WALKING DEAD': Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said the federal government si committing the same kind of fraud that would get banks shut down, by failing to ensure its money is spent wisely . IDENTITY FRAUD: Bureaucrats at the government benefits agency, located in Baltimore, Maryland, failed to enter Social Security numbers into the 'Master Death File' Fitton blamed the Obama administration, not just individual criminals, for the lapses. 'When you're an agency and you don't do what you need to do to make sure people aren't getting money they're not entitled to, that's fraud,' he said. 'If you were a bank and you didn't have the checks in place to make sure your money wasn't misused, you'd be shut down,' he said. 'Just ask HSBC what could happen. ... when government agencies do it, they're just told to clean up their act.' 'Social Security is on the verge of bankruptcy,' Fitton warned. 'Unless it's fixed the whole thing collapses. The last they could do is make sure that 6.5 million people who aren't entitled to benefits aren't getting checks.' 'And it's not the dead people who are cashing those checks,' he said.

"A supermarket in Canada is urging its customers to remember that beauty is only skin deep, as it begins selling smaller, misshapen produce to help cut waste.

The wonky food is being sold for a campaign called No Name Naturally Imperfect and will begin with apples and potatoes. Loblaws, Canada's largest food retailer, is selling ‘ugly’ groceries that are up to 30 per cent cheaper than more aesthetically pleasing products . The wonky food is being sold for a campaign called No Name Naturally Imperfect and will begin with apples and potatoes . The supermarket said that produce in the Naturally Imperfect program was previously used in juices, sauces or soups, or may not have been harvested due to their small size . Loblaw senior vice president Ian Gordon pointed out that customers often put too much stock in the look of food. He said in a statement: ‘We often focus too much on the look of produce rather than the taste. Once you peel or cut an apple you can't tell it once had a blemish or was misshapen. ‘No Name Naturally Imperfect is a great example of Loblaw and our vendors coming together to find an innovative way to bring nutritious food options to consumers at a great price.’ The supermarket said that produce in the Naturally Imperfect program was previously used in juices, sauces or soups, or may not have been harvested due to their small size. It said: ‘With this program, Loblaw Companies is working to ensure farmers have a market for smaller, misshapen fruit ensuring it does not go to waste.’ Loblaw senior vice president Ian Gordon said customers often put too much stock in the look of food . It’s estimated that around $31billion worth of food is wasted in Canada every year. Loblaws recently said it plans to spend $1.2billion on infrastructure in 2015, which includes building 50 new stores. Earlier this year, Loblaw’s former chief operating officer, Dalton Philips, was ousted from UK supermarket giant Morrisons. The chain’s board said that it wanted a ‘fresh pair of eyes’ to oversee its revival push. Morrisons, the UK's fourth largest grocer, has grappled with a long period of declining sales and profitability but Mr Philips said recent trading offered signs that the turnaround plan announced last year was starting to pay off.","Loblaws is selling misshapen groceries that are up to 30 per cent cheaper .

"A plus-size blogger who once suffered from an eating disorder has revealed why she feels she is prettiest at her heaviest weight and – and why she proudly calls herself fat – as she strips down to her underwear while on camera for a new body image campaign. Marie Southard Ospina, from Brooklyn, New York, sheds her clothing as a part of StyleLikeU's video series, The What's Underneath Project, in which a select group of individuals were asked to remove their clothes in order to help prove that style is really about knowing who you are and being comfortable in your own skin. 'I try to use the word fat a lot in my writing,' the 23-year-old says in her video. 'I use it to describe myself quite a lot, and I think people's initial reaction is, ""You're not fat. You're beautiful."" That in itself is problematic because that just implies that you can't be fat and beautiful.' Scroll down for video . Great cause: Marie Southard Ospina shed her clothes as part of StyleLikeU's new body image video series titled The What's Underneath Project . She adds: 'It's a characteristic. It's not this horrendous thing.' When the clip opens, Marie is fully dressed and sitting on a stool in front of a brick wall. She first removes her hat and throws it on the ground before she begins to describe her past struggles with body image. 'For a long time my style was just about kind of concealing by body and for maybe until my early twenties it was just about hiding any kind of excess fat,' she says. Marie explains that she now likes to 'counter a lot of the rules' that plus-size women are told to follow, particularly when it comes to fashion, which means she favors tight-fitting dresses and skirts, as well as bold prints and other things 'that aren't necessarily designed to make you more invisible'. She adds that people have been 'taught that fat is an inherently bad thing', so when they see a larger woman in clothes that show off her body, they are opposed to it. Throughout the video, Marie removes her layers of clothing one piece at a time. She recalls being relatively thin as a child, but says she started gaining weight when she was about nine-years-old. She remembers being bullied in elementary school and describes how her family members would make comments about how she needed to start doing sports. Marie notes that, because she takes after her father, who is 6'2 and heavy set, her Colombian mother and her relatives didn't understand how her bone structure was different. While their idea of beauty is large breasts and thick thighs – they don’t understand women who are classed as ‘fat’. Lots of layers: The 23-year-old blogger was fully dressed at the start of the clip . Newfound confidence: Marie removes her clothes as she explains that she once had an eating disorder and struggled with body acceptance . 'If I was going to be curvy, I was going to be fat and as soon I started dropping weight I just became a rail and my curves were gone,' she says. 'They didn't like that either.' Marie says that she believed food was the problem, so she just eradicated it from her life. People didn't realize she had developed an eating disorder at first, and they would often make comments about how her body finally matched the prettiness of her face. 'I think that's the cycle with eating disorders in general,' she says. 'I think you start to get used to the praise, and so you just want to do it more and more. You want to lose more weight. You want to hear that you are doing something good.' Two years into her eating disorder, her mom realized something was wrong. Marie was quickly told to start working with a nutritionist and was also sent to see a therapist. She says she gained a lot of weight back in her later years of high school and when she started college she was a size 14 - but she still wasn't eating healthy. It wasn't until she set off to spend a year studying abroad in Madrid and Prague that she started to accept her body. 'People just didn't seem to look at my size,' she says of the people she met in Spain. 'People when they talk to you they actually talk to you and they're not secretly thinking this girl's a** is so big or she needs to lose some weight.' Marie adds: 'It was more like people actually made the effort to get to know me.' Nothing to hide: Marie even removes her make-up in the video after she notes that she feels her prettiest when she is 'fresh-faced' Final pieces: After removing her socks and pantyhose, Marie is left sitting in a lace bra and underwear . It was there that she met her partner, who she is still with to this day. Marie describes him is a 'thin, pretty guy' who has never been directly attacked for his body, yet he has 'a lot of problems with how beauty is perceived' and is 'really into body positivity'. She notes that she feels her prettiest when she and her partner wake up in the morning and she is fresh-faced. Marie, who once used to hide in her cover-up, says she wore her first real bikini last year. 'Beauty literally comes in every shape and size and we should be able to use the word [fat] without it being tied to these treacherous connotations,' she explains. She admits that she has gained weight in the past 18 months, but it is not something that bothers her anymore.

"Pregnant women have been warned that a type of antibiotic could harm their unborn baby. Researchers from Great Ormond Street Hospital and University College London have linked erythromycin pills with epilepsy and cerebral palsy. The study tracked the health of babies born to 200,000 British women. Overall, the babies born to women who took antibiotics were no more likely to develop epilepsy or cerebral palsy. Woman have been warned the common antibiotic erythromycin could harm their unborn baby (file photo) But women treated with erythromycin and other pills from the macrolide family of antibiotics were almost twice as likely to have a baby with one of these conditions as those given penicillin. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, found that a third of expectant mothers were given antibiotics during pregnancy, most commonly penicillin. Just 7 per cent of the women prescribed antibiotics were given macrolides, which are used to treat urinary and chest infections and are particularly likely to be given during recurrent illness or if a woman is allergic to penicillin. However out of every 150 women given a macrolide rather than penicillin, there was one more baby born with cerebral palsy or epilepsy. Researcher Professor Ruth Gilbert advised pregnant women to keep taking any antibiotics that they are prescribed – as an infection is likely to harm their baby. Erythromycin are   from the macrolide family of antibiotics. Macrolides are used to treat urinary and chest infections and are particularly likely to be given during recurrent illness or if a woman is allergic to penicillin. And she stressed that any increased risk to the unborn child posed by the pills would be extremely small. However, with four previous studies raising concerns about the pills, she said it was time for the pills to be thoroughly reviewed by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Professor Andrew Whitelaw, of Bristol University, warned that a bad infection could end up killing both the mother and her child. But he added: ‘Nevertheless, drug treatment in pregnancy requires a very high level of safety and it will not surprise me if the regulatory authorities advise doctors to avoid or severely restrict macrolides in pregnancy’. Others said that the study does not prove that macrolides are harmful, as it could be that the bugs they are used treat are more likely to damage the brain than other infections. Erythromycin is used to treat urinary and chest infections and are particularly likely to be given during recurrent illness or if a woman is allergic to penicillin . Dr Christoph Lees, of Imperial College London, said: ‘One thing is for sure: pregnant women should definitely take antibiotics when prescribed them as the risk of untreated infection to the pregnancy can be catastrophic. ‘To put things in context, the extra risk to their baby of being prescribed macrolides, if indeed there is a risk, is very tiny.’ The medicines’ watchdog, the MHRA, said it has already sought independent advice on the study and it does not consider that the research provides proper proof that macrolides are dangerous. A spokesman said: ‘Importantly, this study found no overall evidence of harm when antibiotics are prescribed in pregnancy. ‘Any pregnant woman who has been prescribed antibiotics should continue to take them as instructed and speak to their healthcare professional if they have any questions.’","Erythromycin is an antibiotic  given for urinary and chest infections .

"A brave Indian girl attacked by a drunk man in broad daylight was left speechless when none of the 50 people who were watching did anything to help. Student Pradnya Mandhare said she had not choice but to fight the man off and drag him to a police station herself. The 20-year-old was stunned by the attack because it happened at a train station at around 2.30pm in front of dozens of onlookers and she was convinced that some of the people walking past would step in to help, but nobody did. The third-year media studies student at Sathaye College in the city of Mumbai in western India`s Maharashtra State was on her way home after attending her lectures when the incident took place on the platform at Kandivli station in the north of the city. She said: 'I was really shocked when he came up and just started groping me, and I try to get away from him but he grabbed me then. Scroll down for video . Pradnya Mandhare, 20, fought off a drunk sex attacker then dragged him to a police station single-handedly . The fact no one came to her aid shocked Ms Mandhare, a media studies student, as much as the attack itself . 'The only thing to do because nobody else was doing anything was to hit him and so I belted him with my bag. Drug addict and alcoholic Chavan Chowdee, 25, is  in custody awaiting charges over the attack on Ms Mandhare, which took place on a busy station platform in Mumbai in broad daylight . 'He tried to hit me back and he really stunk of alcohol, but I was determined not to let him get away with it. I know that women don't like to complain to the police but I was determined to make sure he was punished.' The platform where she was attacked had been packed at that time of day but not one person had offered to help her, so she had grabbed him by the hair and dragged him to the police station herself. She said: 'He was telling me to let go and that he would come with me voluntarily, but I didn't trust him and continued to pull him along. I finally managed to hand him over to the police without getting any help from anyone.' Police confirmed they had arrested 25-year-old drug addict and alcoholic Chavan Chowdee, who was currently in custody awaiting charges. The young woman has now been held as an example for others to also take the law into their own hands and not allow men to simply do what they want. She said: 'I don't see myself as a heroine but I also think we should make a stand and let men know they can't just do what they want and treated like objects to be groped whenever they feel like it.' The third-year student (right) was on her way home after attending her lectures when the incident took place . The platform where Ms Mandhare was attacked was packed with travellers but no one offered to help her . Ms Mandhare also told NDTV: 'Most women are scared of approaching the police as filing a complaint is a lengthy process. 'It involves giving a lot of statements and, sometimes, dealing with uncooperative officers. But, I was firm on taking that man to the police. 'Every woman should fight back in such cases and they should not keep quiet. I am grateful that the police also helped me and arrested the accused. 'I also asked the police officers to teach the accused a lesson so that he would not dare to molest a woman ever again. 'This Women's Day a youth had passed a lewd comment at me. I tried taking him to the police station but he managed to escape. 'Parents of girls also think that going to a police station would tarnish their daughter's reputation. 'But, women should raise their voice and teach such people a lesson. Women are not objects for anyone to touch at will.'","Pradnya Mandhare, 20, left stunned by attack in Mumbai, Maharashtra state .

"Motorists in Brighton and Hove have reacted angrily after the council started removing cash parking meters and encouraged them to pay by phone . Motorists have reacted angrily after a city council started removing parking meters to encourage them to pay by mobile phone. The move away from simple pay and display to an online system has already led to one driver being charged more than £5,000 after they entered the wrong digits on their phone. Residents in Brighton and Hove have complained that it is making parking unnecessarily complicated. But the Green Party-controlled council insists paying by phone can be easier because drivers no longer have to scrabble around to find the right change. Many councils across the country have started to allow drivers to pay for parking on their mobile phones. In Brighton and Hove, half of all coin-fed meters will have disappeared by June as part of a cost-cutting move. Instead drivers will have to register online at home or from their mobile phones in the street when they want to park. Payments are made by calling an automated service, sending a text or using a smartphone app. It costs 10p to pay by phone or motorists can skip the charge by going to a local shop to pay. No tickets need to be displayed and parking wardens instead check whether people have paid by checking car numberplates on mobile devices. Steve Percy, of local campaign group People’s Parking Protest, said that the council is unfairly punishing motorists. ‘I’m infuriated,’ he said. ‘Not everyone has a mobile phone and you cannot always get signal ... It is especially unfair on older people.’ The council has said that it could remove all parking meters by 2017. Earlier this year it emerged that a motorist was hit with a £5,340 ticket after inadvertently entering the wrong amount while trying to pay for parking that should have cost them £15.30. Payments are made by calling an automated service, sending a text or using a smartphone app. It costs 10p to pay by phone or motorists can skip the charge by going to a local shop to pay . Elsewhere, some London boroughs have reduced the number of pay and display machines to lower costs. In Camden the council introduced a new policy where the nearest parking meter can be up to a five-minute walk away. In November toll booths were removed on the Dartford Crossing between Essex and Kent. Motorists now pay the charge online, by text message or by phone, and it is enforced using numberplate recognition cameras.","Brighton and Hove residents complained about removing parking meters .

"Travellers could soon fly non-stop from Europe to Australia - or even further - under plans to change how planes use fuel. A collaborative team of scientists from nine institutions across Europe has designed a so-called Cruiser-Feeder concept that would allow planes to refuel in mid-air. The system would involve a refuelling plane, carrying enough kerosene to top up to five passenger planes, located at various points along flight routes. Scroll down for video . A collaborative team of scientists from nine European universities has designed its Cruiser-Feeder concept that would allow planes to refuel in mid-air (illustrated). The system would involve a refuelling plane carrying enough kerosene to top up to five passenger planes located at various points along flight routes . As the passenger plane approaches, the refuelling jet would take off, fly beneath the plane before connecting specially-designed and made fuel tanks and pumps. It would then offload the required amount of kerosene before disconnecting and returning to the ground. An alternative scenario would see the jet circling in the air until it is needed. Air-to-air refuelling would only be carried out near main airways and away from inhabited areas. It is a technique already used by the military, for example, to refuel state aircraft. The civil concept was developed as part of a wider project called Research for a Cruiser Enabled Air Transport Environment (Recreate). It would involve a refuelling plane carrying enough kerosene to top up to five passenger planes located at various points along flight routes.

The civil concept was developed as part of a wider project called Research for a Cruiser Enabled Air Transport Environment (Recreate). The researchers, led by the National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR) in Amsterdam and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), said kerosene reserves make up about a third of the weight on long-distance passenger flights at take-off. Reducing them and refuelling mid-air could mean 'huge savings' and figures suggest fuel burn, and therefore the amount needed at take-off, could be reduced by up to 23 per cent for every 6,000 nautical miles flown by a plane carrying 250 passengers. However, it is not known how much extra energy, fuel and carbon emissions will be released as a result of having more planes in the sky. Nor is it clear how much the reduction in fuel burn and costs created by causing passenger planes to make fewer stops would offset those used by the individual, heavy refuelling jets. MailOnline has contacted the researchers to learn more. The scientists have spent the last three years studying the feasibility of civil air-to-air refuelling operations similar to those used for military aircraft. As the passenger plane approaches, the refuelling jet could take off, fly beneath the plane before connecting specially-designed and made fuel tanks and pumps at targeted locations on the plane (illustrated). It would then offload the required amount of kerosene before disconnecting and returning to the ground . The civil concept was developed as part of a wider project called Research for a Cruiser Enabled Air Transport Environment (Recreate). Air-to-air refuelling (illustrated) would only be carried out near main airways and away from inhabited areas. It is a technique already used by the military . They propose that passenger flights could take off with less fuel and retank once they reach an altitude of 33,000ft (10,000 metres). This would also reduce noise pollution near airports since planes make more noise the heavier they are at take-off, said Leonardo Mafriani from ZHAW. The system would also allow for non-stop flights between destinations as far apart as Zurich and Sydney. The researchers have already tested the concept using simulators to determine that the project is technically possible. The researchers said kerosene reserves make up about a third of the weight on long distance passenger flights at take-off. Reducing them and refuelling mid-air could mean 'huge savings' and figures suggest fuel burn could be reduced by up to 23% for every 6,000 nautical miles flight with a payload of 250 passengers .

However, it is not known how much extra energy, fuel and carbon emissions will be released as a result of having more planes in the sky . The Recreate project also includes a second, more radical proposal which involves building an air-metro system, with giant aircraft circling the globe, and smaller 'feeder aircraft' unloading passengers, luggage and waste midair, transporting them to destinations along the way. The researchers acknowledge though that for the second part of the project 'neither airworthiness nor acceptance of the idea by the general public is within sight.' The concept has been developed by experts from NLR, Amsterdam, DLR Braunschweig in Germany, FOI in Sweden, TU Munich, TU Delft, Queen’s University Belfast, ZHAW in Zurich, Nangia Research Associates and NRG in The Netherlands.","Project is called Research for a Cruiser Enabled Air Transport Environment .

"Pub Landlord Al Murray's campaign to defeat Nigel Farage struggled to get off the ground today, after being told he was too heavy to parachute into the Kent seat where they are both standing for election. The comedian hoped to use the the stunt to reject claims he had been parachuted in to fight the South Thanet seat for his new party FUKP - Free United Kingdom Party. But as the media gathered at Headcorn Aerodrome near Ashford this morning he was told that because he was heavier than the 14st 7lb (92kg) limit to was too big to jump. Scroll down for video . Pub Landlord Al Murray was told he was too heavy to parachute into the South Thanet seat where he is standing for election . He joked that he had been 'held back by health and safety gone mad' as he posed for this photo on Twitter . Murray, 46, is standing in South Thanet, which the Conservative Party won from Labour at the general election in 2010. It is already the focus of huge attention due to Mr Farage's decision to stand there, despite Ukip taking just 5.5 per cent of the votes in the seat five years ago. Recent polls suggest he could be on course to win the seat. Murray's decision to stand against him has been seen as an attempt to undermine Farage's pint-swilling image. FUKP's policies include bricking up the Channel Tunnel, locking up the unemployed and selling beer for 1p per pint. Today the dejected star tried to put a positive spin on his inability to parachute into the seat, telling reporters it proved he was officially a 'political heavyweight'. Murray is standing against Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who has welcomed the addition of the comedian to the campaign, declaring: 'The more the merrier' Age: 46 . Born: Stewkley, Buckinghamshire . Family: Father: Colonel Ingram Murray; Great-great grandfather William Thackeray . Education: Bedford School (boarding), Oxford . Private life: Twice married, father of two . Quote: 'Where would we be without rules, eh? That's right, France. And where would we be with too many rules? Germany' Age: 50 . Born: Downe, Kent . Family: Father: Stockbroker Guy Justus Oscar Farage . Education: Dulwich College (private) Private life: Twice married, father of four . Quote: 'We would not want to be like the Swiss, would we? That would be awful! We'd be rich!' Murrary added: 'Unfortunately today's stunt - and that was exactly what it was, a stunt to garner publicity it might generate - has had to be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. 'It seems that I am too heavy to jump. It's a double whammy. Not only am I another tragic victim of this country's obesity epidemic, but also I have been held back by health and safety gone mad.' CURRENCY . The pound will be revalued at £1.10, so it will now be worth 10p more. NHS . If you come to A&E and it's neither an accident nor an emergency, then you will be sent to a random hospital department to be practised on. FOREIGN POLICY . Germany has been too quiet for too long. Just saying. IMMIGRATION . The reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world. The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse. EUROPE . Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least. LAW AND ORDER . Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed. The 6ft 3in comic said he was unaware how much he weighed. He was asked whether Friday the 13th - today's date - was the best day to perform such a stunt. Murray, dressed in his trademark burgundy blazer, said: 'I'm a true British man - I neither cry nor weigh myself on scales. Those are my values.' Oxford-educated Murray has created an action plan in the guise of his patriotic character, in which he promises: 'I pledge that the UK will leave Europe by 2025 and the edge of the Solar System by 2050. Common Market sense. 'In the meantime Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least.' He included a pledge that the UK will leave Europe by 2025 'and the edge of the Solar System by 2050'. On the hot topic of immigration, he plans to stop people reaching the shores of 'the greatest country in the world' by bricking up the Channel Tunnel - with British bricks and using Polish labour. In a further bid to win over wavering voters, he has promised to introduce '1p a pint', although 'crisps will remain at the current price'. A website has been set up for his campaign, carrying the slogan: 'Other parties offer the moon on a stick. We'll do better than that: a British moon on a British stick.' In nearby Wendover, Bucks, Ukip leader Nigel Farage expressed his doubts about the legitimacy of his rival candidate's campaign. He said: 'He's not even standing as himself, he's standing as his alter ego. 'It is a bit of a laugh and and I have no doubt that in terms of promotion for his tour around the UK he will make a lot of money off the back of it. 'I don't really think the joke is going to last that long.' South Thanet, which includes the coastal towns of Ramsgate, Sandwich and Broadstairs, has previously enjoyed a reputation as an electoral bellwether - held at every election since 1983 by the party that has formed the government of the day .","Comic is standing in South Thanet for 'Free United Kingdom Party' - FUKP .

"Britain yesterday came under an extraordinary attack for failing to pay compensation to France for the migrant chaos in Calais. The port’s mayor Natacha Bouchart launched into a rant at the Government for refusing to fully engage in the European project. Senior Tories said her remarks, made public by the supposedly impartial Council of Europe, amounted to meddling in the general election campaign. Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Natacha Bouchart said migrants were desperate to reach the UK because of Britain's 'cushy benefits system' On the run: Calais has struggled to deal with thousands of illegal immigrants who have gathered in the town . Thousands of illegal migrants have massed in Calais waiting for an opportunity to sneak into lorries, private cars or caravans and enter Britain. But Mrs Bouchart, a long-standing critic of the UK, refused to take any blame. She said: ‘We are suffering the consequences of the British Government’s actions, which takes from Europe the things that suit it, but doesn’t want to get fully involved in the European project. ‘A country cannot remain both in and out of Europe, creating problems but providing no compensation and no support to local authorities, such as mine and others, which are left alone to assume huge responsibilities.’ The interview was circulated by the Council of Europe under the heading: ‘Calais mayor slams the UK over migrants.’ It had been given to the council’s ‘Journal’ programme, in which an interviewer asked Mrs Bouchart a series of questions inviting criticism of the Government. Criticism: The mayor of Calais has attacked Britain for 'not getting fully involved in the European project' Violence: Mass brawls between rival gangs left more than 70 people injured during July and August . A transcript and video of the rant were released yesterday as David Cameron was visiting the Queen to fire the starting gun on the election campaign. The council, made up of 47 member states, has repeatedly clashed with the Tory-led Coalition. It is the body that oversees the European Court of Human Rights, which has ordered ministers to give the vote to prisoners. The Conservatives have threatened to withdraw from the council’s jurisdiction if it does not stop interfering in UK affairs. Mrs Bouchart has previously made a string of attacks on the UK. In October, she said Britain was an ‘El Dorado’ for thousands of migrants flocking to Calais because of generous state handouts. Tory candidate Michael Ellis, who was a member of the home affairs committee, said: ‘The council is brazenly trying to interfere in our election and using the mayor of Calais, who has a history of anti-British political posturing, to do so. ‘The illegal migrant problem in Calais is entirely of France’s own making. They signed up to open borders, we did not. They have been making it worse by building new facilities for illegal migrants.’ Peter Bone, standing for the Tories in Wellingborough, said: ‘The mayor of Calais does not seem to realise that the problems are French, and they should be dealing with it. She needs to get a grip.’ In the interview, Mrs Bouchart repeated her attack on the UK for being a supposed soft touch for illegal immigrants. She said: ‘They want to go to England because they can expect better conditions on arrival there than anywhere else in Europe or even internationally. Chaos: The Calais mayor said, with as many as 3,000 migrants in the port, she could not handle the situation . Camp: Calais is to open the Jules Ferry camp to immigrants, a former children's holiday camp, which will become an immigrant centre - the first stage of which begins as a feeding centre . ‘There are no ID cards. They can easily find work outside the formal economy, which is not really controlled. They can get social welfare support that doesn’t exist in other countries.’ But Tory candidate Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘The problems at Calais did not materialise because the UK is a honeypot but because the EU has the Schengen agreement which means it is quite incapable of controlling its own borders. ‘Until the time of Queen Mary I, Calais was the last bit of France to be English. It would perhaps be better run if it were given back.’","Natacha Bouchart, Calais Mayor, says migrants desperate to reach the UK .

"A family was devastated after they went to visit the grave of their late mother and grandmother only to find a large pile of rubble had been dumped on top of it. Loretta Perminas had taken her two children and three grandchildren to visit her mother Jadvyga's grave in Carlton Cemetery in Nottingham on Mother's Day but found flowers and an ornament on the grave had been pushed aside to make way for a large pile of soil. Ms Perminas 54, said: 'It's just heartbreaking. We didn't even have anywhere to put the flowers.' Scroll down for video . Loretta Perminas took her family to visit the grave of her mother, only to find that it had been covered by a large pile of rubble and the flowers and ornaments she had placed on the plot had been pushed aside . The council has since apologised to the family and said they sometimes have to put soil on nearby graves when they dig a new plot. 'To cover up someone's grave with a pile of rubble is so disrespectful - I couldn't believe it,' added Ms Perminas. 'We wanted to say our prayers on Mother's Day but we couldn't. My grandchildren had written a prayer. 'How do you explain that their great-grandma's grave isn't there because it's just a pile of rubble? I couldn't get to sleep the next night because I was just so devastated.' The grandmother-of-five had taken her family to visit the grave of her mother, who died last year at the age of 89. Since her death the family  have been saving up for a headstone but had placed a memorial plaque, vases and a Holy Mary ornament, which had been blessed by the Pope in Rome, on the grave. Ms Perminas said it was 'heartbreaking' to find her mother's grave covered in the large mound of soil . Jadvyga Perminas (pictured left, aged 28) died about a year ago and was buried in Carlton cemetery (pictured right about six weeks before her death last year) Last Wednesday Ms Perminas visited the site and left flowers and angel ornament. But when she returned just days later she found soil and large rocks had been dumped on her mother's grave, as another plot had been dug about six inches away. The family also believe the new plot encroaches on their land, because they bought three at the time so other family members could eventually be buried alongside Jadvyga. Ms Perminas, a jewellery dealer, added: 'We can't afford a marble memorial but it's irrelevant because it's still my mum's grave. 'I go to see it regularly and it was okay on Wednesday. Gedling Borough Council said the rubble had been placed on top of the grave while they dug a new plot . Ms Perminas' family almost didn't realise the pile of rubble was at the site of their relative's grave . Ms Perminas said flowers and ornaments, including of Holy Mary (blue) had been pushed aside . 'Everything I had left there was chucked to the side like it didn't matter. 'She loved the Holy Mary ornament and it cost hundreds of pounds. The plot belongs to us and they have no right to do that.' Ms Perminas's son Adrian said they almost walked past the grave at first, not realising it was under a heap of discarded rubble. He said: 'It can't have been an accident because they've had to actually move all the stuff, and it's not like there was nowhere else to put the muck. 'Either way, there shouldn't be a grave being dug so close. It's blood-curdling to think they could have disturbed my grandmother's grave.' Gedling Borough Council, which runs the cemetery, has apologised to the family. Ms Perminas said her family had been saving up for a headstone and were devastated by the grave . The plot was covered in flowers before the rubble had been dumped upon it in time for Mother's Day . Peter Barnes, portfolio holder for the environment, said: 'We are really sorry for any distress experienced by the Perminas family. 'Carlton Cemetery is a working cemetery, which means that graves are being dug out and prepared for new burials all the time. 'In this case, a grave was being prepared adjacent to the grave of the Perminas family and, as a result, earth was placed on the adjacent grave, pending the new burial. 'Given the close proximity between graves, this practice is often unavoidable but we always remove any earth that is left on adjacent graves as quickly as possible.' He said that any family items removed as part of a new grave being dug are returned to where they came from.","Loretta Perminas took her family to visit her mother's grave in Nottingham .

"Six suspected IRA terrorists thought to be behind a string of bomb attacks in Britain are facing new police probes after the Government withdraw controversial letters insisting they were no longer wanted. The fugitive paramilitary suspects had all received so-called 'comfort letters' under a peace deal negotiated by Tony Blair. telling them they could return to the UK without fear of being charged. But the letters only came to light last year after the collapse of the terror trail of IRA suspect John Downey, who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the 1982 Hyde Park bombing in London. Tony Blair negotiated a deal with Sinn Fein in which on-the-run terror suspects not wanted by police received 'comfort letters' The case against Mr Downey was thrown out after he produced a letter from the Government telling him he was no longer wanted and was free to travel to the UK. In the fall-out from the trail's collapse, Government ministers launched an inquiry into the letters – and insisted they were not 'get out of jail free cards' for terrorists. Following the Government's intervention detectives now believe these 'comfort letters' do not protect suspects from prosecution, documents leaked to the Telegraph reveal. The Police Service of Northern Ireland wrote to MPs on the Northern Ireland affairs select committee last week, revealing the major new phase in its inquiries into the 'on the run' cases. In the letter, Will Kerr, the Assistant Chief Constable, said the PSNI did not believe there was any barrier to prosecuting 'on the run' suspects who had been sent 'comfort letters' – because Coalition Government ministers have recently said the letters had no legal force. 'Whilst prosecutorial challenges may still lie ahead, the obstacles to investigating, arresting and charging suspects appear to have been removed,' Mr Kerr said. The PSNI will 'prioritise' re-examining the cases of 36 'on the runs' whose status was changed from 'wanted' to 'not wanted' during the scheme run by Mr Blair's government under which Mr Downey was mistakenly given a letter of assurance. It is understood that 'comfort letters' were given to suspects in the Harrods car bomb in 1983, which killed six and injured 90, and the Remembrance Day bombing in Enniskillen in 1987. Tony Blair said the peace process with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams (right) and Martin McGuinness would have collapsed without the letters . Other atrocities under investigation could include the Regent's Park bombing, in which seven military bandsmen were killed, on the same day as the Hyde Park bombing in 1982, and the 1984 Brighton bomb, which targeted the Grand Hotel where Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet members were staying, killing five people and injuring 34. It comes as MPs prepare to publish a year-long inquiry into the 'comfort letters' scheme. As part of the peace deal bringing an end to the conflict in Northern Ireland, IRA terrorists serving prison terms were let out of prison early. But this left the problem of fugitive terror suspects who had never faced trial. In a controversial agreement was reached between Mr Blair and Sinn Fein, police checks would be carried out and those who were no longer wanted would be sent a letter informing them of that fact. IRA terror suspect John Downey was wrongly sent an immunity letter . Mr Blair has insisted that only those individuals who were genuinely not wanted by police, and were therefore not going to face trial, were supposed to have received OTRs. He also insisted the scheme was 'not secret', even though leading Northern Ireland politicians, including Lord Trimble, who was First Minister of Northern Ireland from 1998 to 2002, and senior police chiefs in the province were unaware of it. For the past 12 months, MPs on the Northern Ireland affairs select committee have been investigating the on the run scheme. In a report to be published on Tuesday, the committee is expected to raise questions over whether the policy of sending 'comfort letters' to IRA suspects during Mr Blair's final months in office was lawful. Mr Blair has insisted the Northern Ireland peace process would have collapsed without the controversial scheme giving immunity from prosecution to republican terror suspects – the so-called 'on the runs'. The scheme, set up by the Labour government in 1999, assured more than 200 paramilitary fighters that they were no longer being hunted by the police. Some 95 recipients of the so-called 'comfort letters' were linked to almost 300 murders. Under hostile questioning from the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee, Mr Blair refused to apologise for setting up a process which victims said effectively handed the recipients 'get out of jail free' cards. He told MPs: 'If I had been saying we are not dealing with this in any way at all… I think it is likely that the peace process would have collapsed,' he said. 'I wanted to put the death, destruction, terrorism and misery to an end. I couldn't bring back those people who had died during the Troubles but I was trying to make sure there would not be further victims.'","Fugitive paramilitary suspects had received so-called 'comfort letters'

"A jilted groom who raffled off his honeymoon 'plus one' to a total stranger is back in the UK and sharing his snaps of the paradise getaway. John Whitbread, 32, from Donisthorpe, Leicestershire, only met his pretty blonde travelling companion at the airport before the seven-hour flight, after raffling the spare ticket to his dream honeymoon after his fiancée left him. Now John has shared his pictures of his 'whirlwind adventure' in the Dominican Republic with Kelly Wood, 36, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, in which the duo cavort in a pool and pose on the beach. Scroll down for video . John spent two weeks in the Dominican Republic with Kelly after she won a raffle to accompany him on his honeymoon after being jilted at the alter . And although the pair spent their days lazing by the pool and sipping cocktails, they insist they just became very good friends. John said: 'We had such an amazing time on holiday. 'We had a great laugh and did some amazing things together - Kelly was a great person to go on holiday with. 'It's been a whirlwind adventure, which is exactly what we both wanted, and all the money raised went to charity which was great.' He added: 'It was never really about romance, as I'd just come out of a relationship. But it was lovely to make a great friend, and for that I'm really grateful. 'You hear of people going on holiday with their best mates and falling out, so it's amazing that I managed to become friends with a total stranger. It's sad to think it's all over.' Despite meeting for the first time at the airport, John spent two weeks in paradise in the Dominican Republic with Kelly, 36, the lucky winner . Kelly (pictured left with a parrot and right with John) spotted John's story after watching him being interviewed on TV and won the trip after buying five £10 tickets on Ebay . Appearing on Good Morning Britain today John admitted that the exotic holiday was also tinged with sadness. 'It was my honeymoon at the end of the day, I never did the sob story so it was actually a bit of a tough time for me as well,' he said. 'Kelly was good, she let me have my moments here and there so it was never about that.' Kelly told presenters Susanna Reid and John Stapleton: 'I didn't obviously want to talk about it too much, I thought if John wants to bring it up, then he'll bring it up but I wasn't going to press for information or anything like that. 'I wanted to have a good time, I wanted John to have a good time… but I could see at times he was thinking about where he should have been.' John added gratefully, 'She took my mind off things as well.' Kelly spotted John's story after watching him being interviewed on TV. John had initially planned to sell the spare ticket on Ebay, but after the highest bids were revealed to be fakes, he opted to raffle the ticket off instead, raising £1,410 for testicular cancer charity Balls To Cancer.

'I was stuck in a bit of a rut at the time - I hadn't gone on holiday for ages, and I'd been single for a while - so I couldn't see why not. 'I wanted an adventure and this seemed perfect. 'The day of the raffle I was really nervous but so excited, I really wanted to win. When I finally found out I was going I couldn't believe it, it was really overwhelming. 'When I told my friends and family they were all really excited for me.' The pair then met for the very first time on the morning before their seven-hour flight. The pair (pictured leaving for their trip) spent their days lazing by the pool and spitting cocktails, but insist that they remain just good friends .

But despite followers of their story hoping for romance, John and Kelly insist that they are just good friends. Kelly said: 'It would have been nice to meet someone, but it was never really about romance for me. John had just split up with his partner, so it wasn't really the aim of the holiday. 'You could tell at times that it must have been hard for him - there were a lot of couples at the resort, and after all we were on the honeymoon he should have been sharing with his wife. 'But if he ever had a quiet moment he was back to his bubbly self in no time.' Jilted John and Kelly Wood meet for the first time before their trip to the Dominican Republic . The pair got off to a good start at the airport but insist they are just good friends . Now the pair look back on their holiday with fond memories, and hope to remain great friends. Kelly said: 'It's been a crazy ride but I've loved every minute. 'Now when people what the most outrageous thing I've ever done is, I won't have to sit with a blank expression on my face.

"A member of the Penn State University fraternity has defended the disturbing Facebook posts of unconscious female students that led to the fraternity's suspension for a year. In an interview, the anonymous member of Kappa Delta Rho described the group as 'satirical' and accused the media of trying to ruin his fellow frat brothers' lives and reputations. This came the same day that screenshots emerged of some of the Facebook comments under posts made to a private group run by members of KDR, that included nude images of women, some of whom had passed out drunk. The screenshots show members of the group had commented referring to the women as 'sloots', saying 'I banged her lol', and then: 'Lol delete those or we will be on cnn in a week'. Scroll down for video . The photos of unconscious female students, described by police as 'disturbing', were accompanied by lewd comments in screenshots entered as evidence by police . Another screenshot of comments on one of the pictures shows a member said: '373,217 views. All from us.' 'Make that 373,218,' came the response. There were 144 members of the invite-only Facebook page. The anonymous group member provided a statement to Philadelphia magazine  and gave an extensive interview. He attempted to justify the existence of the group as 'satire', that 'everyone' does it, and laid a lot of blame on the media, while calling for a return to 'higher standards of morality' and referring to the incident as 'minor'. In his statement he accused the media of attempting to 'ruin people's lives and unjustly ruin reputations' and was challenged in the interview that  posting pictures of nude, unconscious women or intimate messages could ruin their lives or their reputations. At no point was the KDR brother apologetic. Nor did he seem to understand why police and the university administration were investigating the matter. 'How would it do so when it's kept within the entirely, well, it's supposed to be an entirely private group of 144 people?' he responded. Asked if that puts a lot of trust in 144 people when any one of them could repost a picture publicly, he said: 'But nobody except the one kid who snitched out this group did that … It just doesn't work that way.' He added: 'It wasn’t a legitimate concern. ... It is a brotherhood and nobody expects anyone to go and post stuff publicly or so forth and so on. It's a real disappointment that this kid went and did this.' Asked if the fraternity should accept some of the blame he responded: 'I think people should be responsible for themselves, and, I mean, I obviously had nothing to do with any of these postings, but … just think, is it smart to post this on social media? Is this ethical in regards to the people who it involves?' 'But this is not a criminal thing. It's not anyone else's business, pretty much. It's an inter-fraternity thing and that's that,' he added. He made clear that he had not posted any of the offensive material, nor commented on it, and that in retrospective, given the events, he regretted being part of the group. 'It was a satirical group. It wasn't malicious whatsoever. It wasn't intended to hurt anyone. It wasn't intended to demean anyone. It was an entirely satirical group and it was funny to some extent.' He likened the group to totalfratmove.com and 'raunchy' Snapchats that 'people send all the time'. The group was known as '2.0' and was started approximately eight months ago after its predecessor 'Covert Business Transactions' was shut down when a female student saw a topless photo of herself on a computer that had been left logged into the group. She was upset and threatened the Fraternity who closed the group. Members of Penn State's Kappa Delta Rho fraternity (pictured) posted photos to a Facebook page that showed unconscious nude female students . Asked why the group was relaunched, the group member said that its primary use was for communication within the fraternity about community service and social events. Police learned of the page when a former member of KDR, but still a member of the Facebook group, came to them and began acting as an informant. In addition to the photos of unsuspecting victims, the group was also used for drug sales and hazing. The informant told police that the drugs included marijuana and edibles, concentrates, ADD medication and some cocaine. The informant provided multiple print outs to police and said when asked about one of the pictures: 'This is the type of stuff that happens at KDR.' At a press conference on Tuesday Assistant Police Chief John Gardner said: 'The images are disturbing, I’ll tell you that. I don’t want to get into any more specifics.' Police are working with the Office of Student Conduct and Penn State's Inter-Fraternity Council, in their investigation. They are trying to get the fraternity to cooperate and help identify any members that posted photos as well as any of the victims. Possible charges include invasion of privacy and harassment, though police are not ruling out other  options.

"Are you better off than you were five years ago? This will be one of the central questions of the general election. British politicians on both sides hope to recreate the powerful attack that Ronald Reagan famously launched against Jimmy Carter in the 1980 US Presidential election, when he asked if voters if they felt their incomes had improved over four years. George Osborne yesterday boasted that this year families will be £900 better off than in 2010, while Labour claims workers are £1,600 worse off. But who is telling the truth about the impact on family incomes of one of the slowest recoveries in our history? Scroll down for video . Labour's figures are based on the falling value of average wages in real terms. The Tories' focus on real household disposable income takes into account the effect of tax and benefit changes, and suggests incomes overtaking 2010 levels by the end of 2015 . Chancellor George Osborne argues that families will be better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 . One of the big surprises of the Budget yesterday was George Osborne's announcement that incomes this year would be higher in real terms than in 2010. After years of austerity and slow growth, many Tories had given up hope being able to go into the election with voters feeling the benefits of the recovery. The Chancellor told MPs: 'To the question of whether people are better off at the end of this Parliament than they were five years ago we can give the resounding answer 'yes'. 'You can measure it by GDP per capita, and the answer is yes – up by 5 per cent. 'Or you can use the most up-to-date and comprehensive measure of living standards which is Real Household Disposable Income per capita. 'In other words, how much money families have to spend after inflation and tax. 'It is the living standards measure used by the Office for National Statistics and by the OECD. 'On that measure I can confirm, on the latest OBR data today, living standards will be higher in 2015 than in 2010. 'And it confirms they are set to grow strongly every year for the rest of the decade. 'The British people for years paid the heavy price of the great recession. 'Now, the facts show households on average will be around £900 better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 – and immeasurably more secure for living in a country whose economy is not in crisis anymore, but is instead growing and creating jobs.' Labour's Ed Balls claims wages are worth £1,600 less in real terms than they were in 2010 . Labour has long argued that wages outstripped by inflation have left workers feeling poorer. They argue that average weekly earnings have fallen in real terms from £453 in 2010 to £418 in April 2014. The attack is based on the claim that austerity choked off the recovery in 2010, leaving employers unable to give pay rises. Each year that prices rose faster than wages, workers saw that they cash did not go as far each month as it used to. In the Commons today, Ed Balls declared: 'For all the Chancellor's hubris, yesterday's Budget has changed nothing for working people in our country. 'The Chancellor spent an hour telling people they have never had it so good but working people are still GBP1,600 a year worse off on average after five years of the Tories.' 'Even on his own measure, people are worse off than they were in 2010. 'This is the first Parliament since the early 1920s when the average person in work will be worse-off at the end of a parliament than they were at the beginning. 'The fact is in answer to the famous Reagan question - 'Are you better off than you were five years ago?' The answer is a resounding no.' They both are. Sort of. Much of the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the Tories and Labour are using different figures and different time scales. George Osborne used Real Household Disposable Income, which is the amount of money a family has AFTER tax and benefit changes take effect. Figures published by the Office for Budget Responsibility show that RHDI is lower than in 2010 in every year until the end of 2015, before rising annually towards 2019. Technically it means that incomes will not be above 2010 levels until the end of this year, not before the election. Ed Balls uses gross weekly earnings, which is the amount workers are paid BEFORE tax and benefit changes take effect. Labour's figures also only cover the period up to April 2014, compared to Mr Osborne's date at the end of 2015. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: 'Average household incomes have just about regained their pre-recession levels. They are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010, and possibly higher than their 2009 peak. 'But that still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history. Having household incomes crawl back up above pre-recession levels six or seven years after the recession hit is no cause for celebration. 'As ever there is much truth in both numbers. Real earnings have fallen, as Mr Miliband says. Real incomes should be above their 2010 level as Mr Osborne says. 'We are for sure much worse off on average than we could reasonably have expected to be back in 2007 or indeed back in 2010.' Whether or not voters feel they are better off - and crucially will get better off in the future - will be key to deciding who is in Number 11 after the election . When voters go to the polls in 49 days, both sides will keep repeating their claims. Neither of which will reflect the true state of family finances on May 7. Labour is still looking back a year, while the Tories are looking ahead seven months, based on a forecast. In truth, most people do not really know if they are actually better off than they were five years ago, when inflation, tax and benefits are taken into account. Being told you're better off will alienate those who are struggling, but after years of austerity voters also want a bit of optimism. Even if they do not yet feel like the good times are back, they will want to believe George Osborne when he says: 'The sun is starting to shine.' And for the first time in five years he has some figures to prove it.","George Osborne claimed in Budget that families will be better off in 2015 .
Figures are based on Real Household Disposable Income after tax .
Ed Balls says workers were £1,600 worse off in April 2014 than in 2010 .

"It is a luxury jet equipped with its own presidential area and is billed by its owners as The Head of State. And for a total of four days, it is the preferred mode of transport for Prince Charles on his tour of the United States. Prince Charles chartered the specially converted Airbus A320-232 from Masterjet based in Paris. Unlike a normal passenger jet, which can carry in the region of 180 passengers, this aircraft only has space for 26. Although, for the VIPs on board they have luxury clubman style recliner seats, while there is even a large double bed and shower room in the presidential area. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles chartered the luxury 'Head of State' Airbus A320-232 jet, pictured, to fly to the United States for a four-day trip to Paris . The jet started out life as an ordinary passenger jet, but was completely refurbished with luxury equipment, including its own bedroom (above) Guests on board the aircraft can stroll along the spacious corridor, left, or take a shower, right, but it now only accommodates for 26 people . The jet even comes equipped with a Nespresso coffee machine as well as WIFI and satellite phones. MailOnline estimates that the aircraft would cost in the region of £250,000 to charter for four days on a trans-Atlantic trip. A spokesman for Clarence House declined to reveal the cost of the trip when contacted. In December William and Kate travelled to New York on a scheduled British Airways flight ahead of a royal tour with their seven-strong entourage. The couple were also seen boarding a British Airways plane as they prepared to travel back to London, following their annual holiday on the island of Mustique last month. The Head of State aircraft, meanwhile, was chartered from Masterjet in Paris and is normally based in Le Bourget Airport. It flew on Tuesday to RAF Brize Norton before travelling to Andrews Airforce Base in Maryland. The 2003 jet started its life working for US low-cost carrier JetBlue before it was purchased by Masterjet and completely refurbished. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are visiting Washington and Kentucky during the trip. He last visited the U.S. in April 2011 . The aircraft, which is based in Paris, has its own special private zone described as 'the presidential area' o rbilled by its owners as The Head of State . Even the aircraft's toilet, pictured, is outfitted to the highest possible standards with leather and gold and for VIPs there's a larger shower room . Despite having the same airframe as a normal passenger jet, this highly modified model carries just 26 people. Normal jets carry 180 people . According to Masterjet, the aircraft has 'a brand new interior with unique 26 passengers VIP configuration'. There is also a bedroom, private office, bathroom and shower in the 'presidential area'. Passengers on board the luxury jet can avail themselves of WIFI access within the cabin and a 10-channel TV system with some 200 movies on demand. There are also two 42 inch wall mounted screens, and five smaller 21 inch screens. There are eight, 10 inch screens in the armrests of the first class cabin. According to Masterjet's website, a flight from London to Maryland next Tuesday and returning next Friday on an Airbus 320 corporate jet with 26 passengers would cost £205,187. The amount when VAT at 20 per cent is added rises to £246,224. The luxury jet has its own conference room and is even equipped with a Nespresso coffee machine as well as WIFI and satellite phones . A spokesperson for Clarence House said the cost of chartering the jet will be released later this year but MailOnline estimates it to be in the region of £250,000 . In April 2011, when the Prince last visited the U.S, he opted to use a private jet owned by Texan financier Joe Allbritton to meet with President Barack Obama and give an address to an agriculture conference. In March 2007, he used the Royal Flight to travel to Scotland instead of using a more environmentally friendly alternative. He flew on the HS125 from RAF Lyneham, near his Highgrove Estate to the Queen Mother's former country house near Balmoral. At the time, environmentalists estimated that the carbon footprint for the 500-mile trip was more than 15,000kg per passenger - compared to a mere 60kg for travelling by train. In 2008 he spent almost £700,000 on a tour of the Far East, while in March 2009 he spent a further £698,890 on a trip to South America. Although in December 2013, Prince Charles spent £246,160 on a private jet for the state funeral of Nelson Mandela in South Africa. A trip to India and Sri Lanka cost a further £350,000 while a five-day tour of the Middle East cost a further £228,426.

"This winter has been the season that literally divided America into two. This stunning weather map shows how those in the west of the country enjoyed one of the warmest February's on record, while those in the east endured heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures. The extreme contrast in temperatures has been put down to global warming and the melting sea ice in the Arctic by some experts, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. The satellite image produced by NASA records the land surface temperature. The places that experience below average conditions are coloured blue, normal appear white and those in red were warmer than average . The map has been produced using data from NASA's Terra satellite and shows how temperatures this February compared with those over the last ten years.. The satellite recorded the land surface temperature and the map  shows a clear divide  right down the middle of the country. The areas that experienced cooler than average conditions are coloured in blue, normal appear white, and those in red were warmer than average. The mercury soared some 10 degrees approve than average in the western half and those in the east saw temperatures 10 degrees below average. Statewide data showed that no state experienced record cold temperatures in February, but many cities broke their own records, according to Live Science. In New York a new low of minus 13 degrees was set, beating its old record by 1.6 degrees. Last month huge ice sheets formed on the surface of New York's Hudson River forcing the US Coastguard to deploy ice breakers in order to keep shipping and ferry traffic moving. Ferry operators in the city described it as the worst winter they had experienced in more than 28 years. A huge ice volcano also appeared in a New York Park. Records were also broken in the likes of Worcester and Massachusetts. In contrast record highs were set in the likes of Washington, Nevada, and California during February, according to the website. California is in the midst of a three year drought that has been caused by a combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall. This has produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years, according to a study. Experts predict it will take about 11 trillion gallons of water (42 cubic kilometers) -- around 1.5 times the maximum volume of the largest U.S. reservoir - for California to recover.

The dry bed of the Stevens Creek Reservoir in California: A combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during California'sthree-year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years . Researchers were reportedly exploring a number of possible causes behind the contrasting weather patterns seen across the US last. NASA's Earth Observatory said: 'Most meteorologists attribute the sharply contrasting temperatures to the combination of a persistent ridge of high pressure—nicknamed the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge”—over the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and an equally persistent trough that has funneled chilly air from the Arctic into central North America. 'But why that resilient ridge has appeared over the northeastern Pacific during the last few winters is a more complicated and controversial question among experts. 'A new line of research suggests that the loss of Arctic sea ice associated with global warming may be causing the jet stream to slow down and become wavier, thus setting up the unusual pattern over North America. 'Other researchers think there could be a link between Siberian snowfall and mid-latitude weather extremes. 'Still others think changes in the Arctic have little to do with mid-latitude weather extremes; instead they see periods with an anomalously sharp gradient in sea surface temperature in the far western Pacific as the key factor. All participants looking at the question agree: more research is needed.'","Weather map produced using data from NASA's Terra Satellite that measures land surface temperature .

"She weighs in at an impressive 100,000 tons and is longer than The Shard is tall. And today the mammoth USS Theodore Roosevelt was anchored just off the coast of Hampshire because she was simply 'too big' to sail into the Royal Navy's historic Portsmouth dockyard. Thousands of stunned spectators jammed roads and lined the banks of the River Solent to welcome the 1,092ft-long floating city as it arrived for a five-day visit to the UK on the first stop of a global deployment. Scroll down for video . Thousands of spectators lined the banks of the River Solent in Hampshire today to welcome the 1,092ft-long USS Theodore Roosevelt as it arrived for a five-day visit to the UK. The U.S. aircraft carrier, which measures 1,092ft in length, docked off Stokes Bay in Gosport, Hampshire . The 100,000-tonne U.S. aircraft carrier was forced to anchor off Stokes Bay in Gosport because it was 'too big' to sail into the Royal Navy's historic Portsmouth dockyard. More than 5,000 sailors are set to swamp Portsmouth during the five-day visit, giving a boost to the economy . The carrier measures 1,092ft in length, which is the equivalent to 30 London buses, and displaces up to 100,000 tons of water at full load . The mighty ship, which is making its first port of call during a round-the-world deployment, is much larger than the Royal Navy's next generation of carriers, The Prince of Wales and Queen Elizabeth, which weigh in at 65,000 tonnes when they finally become operational . Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'The USS Theodore Roosevelt's visit shows yet again that UK/U.S. relations are as close as ever' The Royal Navy’s First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, said today: ‘It is excellent to see US Navy carrier steel in Portsmouth' While a debate rages in the UK over the Government's failure to commit to the Nato target of spending two per cent of GPD on defence, the Roosevelt is a potent symbol of American military might. With 90 aircraft on board, the ship can operate for up to 25 years at over unlimited distances, projecting US air power around the globe. She can go three months without resupply and her two giant nuclear reactor generate enough power for a small city. One social media user wrote: 'Most ships get measures in metres, this one comes in acres!' Another joked in reference to recent increased tensions between the West and Russia: 'Wonder if any Russian bombers will fly up the Channel this week?' Brian and Jacqui Rodgers, who travelled from Dorset to see the 30-year-old carrier arrive at Stokes Bay, said they were 'very impressed' by the ship. Mr Rodgers told The News local paper: 'It's a slumbering giant. I guess it's one of the biggest carriers in the world. 'It's a bit like watching a floating town arrive off the coast.' Mrs Rodgers added: 'It's massive. When you see a sailing boat by go by the side of it you realise how huge it is.' American sailors have disembarked from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier for shore leave while it is moored in Stokes Bay, Gosport . The American crew of more than 5,600 includes 3,200 sailors and 2,480 airmen, a number which is expected to have a huge impact on the area . The city's bars, clubs, restaurants and visitor attractions are bracing themselves for a massive footfall when the sailors hit dry land . The arrival of the thousands of sailors is set to boost local economy by an estimated £1.5million during the ship's five-day visit .

The mighty ship, which is making its first port of call during a round-the-world deployment, is much larger than the Royal Navy's next generation of carriers, The Prince of Wales and Queen Elizabeth, which weigh in at 65,000 tonnes when they finally become operational. Among Roosevelt's crew are six Royal Navy aircraft handlers who are honing their skills before serving aboard the new Royal Navy carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, which enters service in 2017. The carrier's escort ship, the guided missile destroyer Winston S Churchill, was able to dock at Portsmouth. She traditionally carries a UK navigator to honour the ship's British connection with the post currently held by 27-year-old Lieutenant Lynsey Sewell. Welcoming the U.S. ship, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said last night: 'The USS Theodore Roosevelt's visit shows yet again that UK/US relations are as close as ever. Ten days ago, I was the first of his counterparts to meet incoming Defence Secretary Ash Carter. 'Having the Roosevelt in Portsmouth today is yet another example of the world's broadest, deepest and most enduring defence relationship at work. I'm thrilled to be going aboard today to welcome the crew personally.' The USS Theodore Roosevelt was accompanied into Hampshire by its escort ship, the destroyer Winston S Churchill, which traditionally has a UK navigator on board to honour the ship's British connection and the post is currently being held by 27-year-old Lieutenant Lynsey Sewell . The giant aircraft carrier was named after Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, and is nicknamed the 'Big Stick' Following its visit to the UK, USS Roosevelt will make its way to the Middle East where it is expected to take part in airstrikes against ISIS . More than 5,000 American sailors are due to disembark from the aircraft carrier while it is moored in  Gosport, over the next five days, giving local businesses an estimated £1.5million boost. Donna Jones, leader of Portsmouth council, said: 'This is great news for Portsmouth' Spectators were keen to take photographs and 'selfies' of the ship as it made its way in to Hampshire today before docking in Gosport . Among Roosevelt's crew are six Royal Navy aircraft handlers who are honing their skills before serving aboard the new HMS Queen Elizabeth . The Royal Navy's First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, added: 'It is excellent to see US Navy carrier steel in Portsmouth. And in barely two years we will see UK carrier steel here too. 'We warmly welcome the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group - a reflection of the close partnership between our nations and navies, and the value of credible seapower in support of our shared national interests.' Senior officers aboard the American ship will visit Royal Navy officials to discuss recent global operations and get an update on the UK's carrier programme. Donna Jones, leader of Portsmouth council, said: 'This is great news for Portsmouth because it means money spent in local businesses, restaurants, cafes and shops, as well as strengthening the ties between the British and American Navy.'","USS Theodore Roosevelt anchored off coast of Hampshire because it was 'too big' to dock at Portsmouth dockyard .

"The murky waters of London's  River Thames have receded to reveal hundreds of grim discoveries over the years. And residents of Gravesend, next to the mouth of the famous waterway, feared they had stumbled upon another gruesome find this morning when this apparent skeleton turned up on the muddy banks. With two bone-like sticks appearing to be bent at the knees lying below seeming ribs and a skull, morning walkers thought they had come across the watery grave of a long-lost soul. This gruesome-looking object was found apparently washed up on the banks of the  Thames this morning . But as they approached the object, which was lying beneath the town's pier, witnesses realised the supposed skeleton was just an optical illusion. Photographer Rob Powell, who was at the pier taking pictures of a ship for  website OnTheThames.net, said: 'I had to double take at first as it's not the kind of thing you usually see by the riverside. 'Obviously, it looked like a skeleton, which was a bit grim, and it was only when I got closer that I realised it was metal and old rope.' The objects became the talk of the town after Mr Powell posted a photo on Twitter. Gravesend town centre manager Graham Long tweeted: 'We've not seen anything like that before - how bizarre and intruiging.' And the town's RNLI spokesman Alan Carr said the find looked 'very sinister'. The object, spotted beneath a pier, turned out to be rope and metal poles which look like a skeleton . As well as a reported 50 corpses a year, the Thames has given up a series of mysterious objects over the river's long history. In 1857, the 4th century BC 'Battersea Shield' was discovered during dredging for the Chelsea Bridge, and is now seen as one the UK's most significant pieces of Celtic ancient art. Prehistoric animal remains have also been discovered on the riverbed and banks, including the tooth of a 28-metre-long Megalodon shark thought to be 1.5 million years old, and a section from the skull of a 30,000-year-old woolly rhino. In 2013, river-users thought they has spotted an alligator living in the river - but it turned out to be a lost prop from the film set of James Bond film Live and Let Die, which had been washed away from its owner's garden. Flotsam often washes up at Gravesend, a town situated at the mouth of the famous river, in Kent .","Residents of Gravesend find gruesome-looking discovery on riverbank .

"The scenario is familiar to millions of people who idly surf the internet and toy with potential purchases on Amazon. But what many of the retail giant’s customers, including celebrities and politicians, do not realise is that their private tastes and interests can be easily accessed with the click of a mouse. Items on their ‘Wish Lists’ – those products they might want to buy in the future or hope to receive as gifts – can be seen simply by inserting a name or email address into a search box. The only way users can keep choices private is by clicking on a barely noticeable ‘manage your lists’ button. When The Mail on Sunday tested the system, we uncovered lists matched to several celebrities, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Pippa Middleton and Downton Abbey star Michelle Dockery. A search for Miss Middleton revealed that she added two A-Level Geography text books to her Wish List in June 2006 – a strange choice since she was studying for a degree in English Literature at Edinburgh at the time. Her mother Carole also has a list, and it reveals her green-fingered habits as it includes the book The Great Vegetable Plot, described as a guide to ‘creating the perfect vegetable garden with the minimum of fuss and effort’. Celebrity wishlist: The private tastes and choices of anyone can be accessed simply by inserting a name into a search box. A Mail on Sunday test revealed comedian Michael McIntryre appears to have listed diet books, Nigella Lawson, cupcake books and Benedict Cumberbatch had his eye on organic lavender hand and body soaps . Oscar-nominee Cumberbatch sticks to type – appearing to have listed a Kindle version of The Complete Works Of Shakespeare – ahead of his much-anticipated debut as Hamlet at the Barbican later this year. However, perhaps with the recent Oscars ceremony in mind, there are also bottles of organic lavender soap. Privacy: These instructions can ensure keep your wishes away from prying eyes . Surprisingly for a Domestic Goddess, Nigella Lawson appears to wish for two books on cupcakes, while TV presenter Carol Vorderman’s list hints at how she maintains her fabulous figure. She lists a trampoline – and ‘body sculpture’ underwear. Miss Dockery had a chrome bell and kitsch wicker basket for her bicycle on her Amazon Wish List. The list was deleted after we pointed out the privacy breach to her representatives. While Liberal Democrat and Conservative members of the Cabinet all hid their choices behind privacy settings, some Labour frontbenchers appeared to be more relaxed about their browsing. The list of Stella Creasy, the 38-year-old cat-loving Walthamstow feminist who was recently appointed to Ed Miliband’s Shadow Cabinet, includes the book Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women And The Rise Of Raunch Culture. Jon Cruddas, Mr Miliband’s policy chief, appears to be keen on This Is England, a 2006 film drama about skinheads. If you insert the name Ed Balls, just one item comes up – The Rainbow, by D.H. Lawrence, who went to the same school in Nottingham as the Shadow Chancellor. However, it seems that the Amazon system is easy to manipulate. There is a Wish List purporting to contain the perfect gifts for Chuka Umunna, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary – a £39 pot of Neal’s Yard face cream, a book on Rock And Pop Fashion by Malcolm McLaren, and a pair of swanky Brook Taverner moleskin trousers (34in waist). A bemused spokesman said last night: ‘It is a different Chuka Umunna. He has never selected those items.’ Pippa and Carole Middleton did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Carol Vorderman said that the former Countdown star had not placed the items on the Wish List, but said that up to a dozen members of her family used the account. The trampoline and body-shaping undergarment were deleted after the TV presenter was approached by The Mail on Sunday. A source at the Information Commissioner’s Office said it would be willing to look into the privacy issue. Amazon said: ‘You can set up your list so that it’s visible only to yourself, to people with a direct link, or to anyone.’ The spokesman then described a link buried in its website which explains how to make lists private. Amazon has been accused of breaching customers’ privacy by making it unclear how shoppers can make their Wish Lists private. The world’s largest online retailer automatically sets customers’ Wish Lists as being available to public view – which critics say leaves them open to snooping or abuse. Internet privacy expert Alan Stevens said it should be the other way around. ‘Amazon has an obligation to look after people’s interests and these settings should be private unless someone wants to make them public,’ he said. ‘It is simply unacceptable that millions of people are unaware that their shopping habits and interests are on show to the world. It is up to Amazon to be much clearer and honest.’ It follows criticism of internet giants over a number of privacy breaches – including the theft last year of the details of 223 million eBay users in the most widespread computer hack in history. Easy: Products people might want to buy in the future or hope to receive as gifts can be seen simply by inserting a name or email address into a search box. The only way users can keep choices private is by clicking on a barely noticeable ‘manage your lists’ button . Amazon has also faced controversy over its use of ‘cookies’, which store information on what shoppers have been looking at so it can market other products to them. Critics say it is invasive, but the company says the cookies help consumers because they filter out items they are not interested in. And Amazon has come under fire over claims that millions of UK customers may have been ‘duped’ into signing up to its £79-a-year Prime service by not cancelling a 30-day free subscription offer. Customers sign up for the promotion so they can get free delivery on items they are purchasing at the online checkout. But what many people do not realise is that the onus is on them to cancel the subscription at the end of the free period.

"A woman with a neck tattoo was made to cover up her ink before being allowed to enter a casino. Bianka Roggensack went to Jupiter's Casino, on the Gold Coast in Queensland,on Saturday night for her sister's 21st birthday but the celebrations were dampened before the party even began. The Palm Beach tattooist said it was the first time she had encountered discrimination against her body art, even though she has at least 20 tattoos. She's had her neck creation for the past five years. Bianka Roggensack had to conceal her neck tattoo with makeup before being allowed to enter Jupiters casino . Gypsy's (left), Bianka's sister, 21st birthday celebrations were dampened before they started . Bianka said tattoos don't reflect the person inside . 'I was asked to step to one side and then told I couldn't be let in because my neck tattoo  was exposed,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I read the entry conditions out the front and there was no mention of tattoos so I asked the security guard and he said the policy was only made about two months ago and the sign hadn't been changed in that time.' Her sister was naturally disappointed that Bianka wasn't allowed in so she asked if there was any way she could be allowed to enter. 'They said that only if I managed to cover it by wrapping a scarf around my neck or putting makeup on it,' she said. 'So we went to my other sister's car and we smothered it all with makeup.' Bianka said she wasn't given an explanation for the rule banning face tattoos. 'I said to them ""what about the tattoos exposed on my fingers, hands and arms?"" but that didn't seem to matter,' she said. 'They also said for future reference that the coverage has to be maintained throughout the night. 'What if I'm dancing and it sweats off?' When Daily Mail Australia asked Jupiters Casino why the policy was implemented they declined to respond but provided the following statement. 'Jupiters Hotel & Casino confirmed the property has a tattoo policy, which is part of its broader dress code policy.' The tattoo has great sentimental value for Bianka because it was done when her mother was diagnosed with an incurable form of cancer . Bianka managed to have a good night with her sisters, Gypsy (left) and Ebony (right) despite being discriminated against for her neck tattoo . The tattoo has great sentimental value for Bianka, as she decided to get the design on her neck at the time her mother was diagnosed with an incurable type of cancer five years ago. Reflecting broadly on her experiences, she said: 'I don't think tattoos reflect the quality of a person at all. 'Why should it then reflect on my standing within society that I chose to remember my mother with a portrait?' The 26-year-old said she was very embarrassed by the incident at the casino and is struggling to make sense of the incident. 'We live in a country that supports and encourages people to be themselves, be individuals and to be an accepting society compared to a lot of places in the world.' She said that although she has never been judged for her tattoos she was aware that discrimination was not an uncommon experience for tattooed people. 'It's a hot topic in the studio - why should people be refused coffees, lunches and manicures because they have tattoos?' she said. 'If people are tattooed or not doesn't make any difference to me.' Bianka now has so many tattoos that she has lost count but predicts it would be at least 20 pieces of body art .","Bianka Roggensack was not allowed in casino because of her neck tattoo .

So when Mary was first served horsemeat, it reduced her to tears. She explained: ‘At 17 I went away to Pau in the South of France for a few months to study domestic science, including cleaning windows with newspaper and water, while living with a Catholic family with ten children. ‘I’d left my pony at home and on the journey I kept seeing horses’ heads in villages, then the first night the family served me horsemeat and I cried and I cried. Tears poured down throughout the meal but they took little notice. I just hated it. ‘I wasn’t allowed in their kitchen during the day and didn’t go in there at night because there were rats.’ The TV chef had only been introduced to domestic science the year before. In an interview with the Observer Food Monthly magazine, she recalled: ‘My parents went to the head teacher at Bath Grammar when I was 16 and said, “What could Mary do?” and she replied, “I don’t know, very little. Perhaps she could be a child’s nurse.” When Mary was better, she went on to win rosettes with Kerry Lass at pony shows. Above the horse visits her in hospital . In an interview the 79-year-old said she first took up baking at school when domestic science was offered as a subject . ‘And my father said, “I’d pity the child.” But I was in the first bunch of pupils who could choose between Latin and maths and domestic science... and there was a brand new domestic science department. ‘I’d never baked with Mother but when I brought home a treacle pudding, Father said it was as good as Mother made.’ Miss Berry, 79, also said that she struggled with her weight in her younger years. ‘I got chubby as a teen, and then, when my children were young, I was half at home and half at work and there were all their crusts available at home and all my cooking and testing at work, and it all went on my bottom, as it may. ‘But I’ve had my bottom under control for the last few years!’ And the wine-loving presenter revealed that she hasn’t touched a drop of alcohol following her knee-replacement surgery in January. ‘Each night since, my husband has said, “A glass of wine, Mary?” and I’ve said no.

"President Barack Obama today said the investigation into police in Ferguson, Missouri, has exposed a 'broken and racially biased system' as he prepared to mark a half-century since 'Bloody Sunday'. Addressing a South Carolina town hall, the 53-year-old leader also said the inquiry - launched in the wake of Michael Brown's 2014 death - has revealed an 'oppressive and abusive' police situation. 'It turns out they weren't just making it up. This was happening,' Obama said, making reference to the  Justice Department's damning report on blacks-targeted racial bias in the St Louis suburb. He told a room of both young and old attendees that Ferguson must now decide how to move forward, adding that America's top goal should be to prevent similar circumstances elsewhere.

'Are they going to enter into some sort of agreement with the Justice Department to fix what is clearly a broken and racially biased system?' he asked of officials who are working in the city. Obama's comments at South Carolina's Benedict College come the day before he leads this weekend's 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', when police beat scores of people marching from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, the state capital, to protest against their lack of voting rights. The violent images broadcast on TV helped lead to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. During today's gathering, Obama made his most expansive comments yet about the Justice Department report, which found systemic racial bias  created a 'toxic environment' in Ferguson. The President, who arrived at Columbia Metropolitan Airport on Air Force One earlier today, said it was striking investigators had merely had to look at emails sent by police  to find evidence of bias. The report cleared Darren Wilson, the white former Ferguson police officer who shot to death 18-year-old Brown, who was black and unarmed, while he was on duty in the city in August 2014. Damning report: 'It turns out they weren't just making it up.

Obama said he fully supported the decision not to charge Wilson - something that led to nationwide protests - telling attendees: 'You can't just charge him anyway because what happened was tragic.' He added: 'That was the decision that was made, and I have complete confidence and stand fully behind the decision that was made by the Justice Department on that issue.' However, in a separate report, federal investigators found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices within the Ferguson Police Department. Shockingly, Obama himself was the subject of some of the racist emails from Ferguson police and municipal courts employees that were uncovered in the investigation. A 2008 email said Obama would not be president for long because 'what black man holds a steady job for four years,' while another depicted the politician as a chimpanzee.

Although Obama said he did not think what happened in Ferguson was typical of the rest of the country, he added that it was not an isolated incident, either. He called for communities to work together to address tensions between police and locals without succumbing to cynical attitudes that say 'this is never going to change, because everybody's racist.' 'That's not a good solution,' Obama said. 'That's not what the folks in Selma did.' During his speech at the college, the President also hinted at what he will speak about on Edmund Pettus Bridge tomorrow, which is the 50th anniversary of the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march. He said the commemoration is as much about stirring young people to change as it is about honoring past legends - and about 'the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things'. 'Selma is not just about commemorating the past, it's about honoring the legends who helped change this country through your actions today, in the here and now,' Obama said. 'Selma is about the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things because they believe they can change the country, they can shape our nation's destiny. 'Selma's about each of us asking ourselves what we can do to make America better. And historically, it's been young people like you who help lead that march.' He added: 'It was young people who stubbornly insisted on justice', noting that one of the most famous leaders of the Selma march - now Georgia Rep. John Lewis - was just 23  at the time.

The visit was Obama's first to South Carolina as President. South Dakota and Utah are now the only states he has not traveled to while in office. In a radio interview broadcast earlier today, Obama said improving civil rights and liberties with police is an area that 'requires collective action and mobilization'. He also spoke again of the Justice Department report, which hit the headlines this week after finding police officers routinely discriminated against blacks in Ferguson by using excessive force.

'I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,' Obama said  on The Joe Madison Radio Show on Sirius XM radio's Urban View channel. He explained: 'I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they're protecting and serving all people and not just some.' Ferguson's city leaders are scheduled to meet with department officials in around two weeks. During the meeting, they are expected to put forward an improvement plan.

"It claimed the lives of four family members and has left his brother bedbound. Now, the cruel disease that has gripped several generations of Chris Graham's family has struck again. Mr Graham himself was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at just 34. The ex-serviceman, now 39, discovered in 2010 that he carries the same faulty gene that claimed the lives of his father, aunt, cousin and granddad, all in their 40s. This rare, inherited, or 'familial' form of Alzheimer's disease has also left his 43-year-old brother, Tony, bedbound in a care home and being fed through a tube. Scroll down for video . Chris Graham was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at just 34. Several members of his family have been killed by the cruel, genetic form of the condition . Like his brother, Mr Graham carries a faulty version of PSEN-1 gene, which affects around 400 families worldwide. The father-of-three, from Carterton in Oxfordshire, is experiencing mild memory problems, but knows it is a case of when, not if, his dementia progresses. Although he is young, the disease process will affect him in the same way as the estimated 500,000 people with Alzheimer's in the UK. Mr Graham, who was medically discharged from the Army in January after 23 years' service, said: 'My friends didn't believe me when I told them I had Alzheimer's disease. 'At the age of 39, it just doesn't make sense to people: I'm fighting fit – how can I have something like that? We still think of Alzheimer's as a bit of forgetfulness as we get older. The truth is far worse.' He continued: 'My family has been hit hard by Alzheimer's. Dad died aged 42. He was in hospital so long I don't really remember him, I was only six or seven at the time. 'His sister, my aunt Thelma, died at 41 as she inherited the faulty gene too. I also lost a cousin, Thelma's daughter, at 41, and a granddad, Dad's father, at 46 to the disease.' This rare, inherited, or 'familial' form of Alzheimer's disease has also left his 43-year-old brother, Tony (pictured with his son), bedbound in a care home and being fed through a tube . The disease also claimed the life of Mr Graham's father. He said: 'My family has been hit hard by Alzheimer's. Dad died aged 42. He was in hospital so long I don't really remember him, I was only six or seven at the time' As one of four children, each of Mr Graham and his siblings had a 50/50 chance of inheriting the gene from their father. While his two sisters avoided the genetic curse, tragically, both he and his brother Tony have been struck by it. Speaking about his brother, who was diagnosed in 2006, said: 'He's in an old folk's home, he can't move and has to be fed through a tube. He can't speak but can raise a smile sometimes.' Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for killing brain cells and shrinking the brain 400 per cent faster than the normal rate of ageing. Mr Graham is now taking part in research studies at University College London's Institute of Neurology to help scientists understand the earliest signs of Alzheimer's to boost the search for new treatments. He said: 'Although I know what will happen to me in the coming years, I now have direction in life. 'I wanted to do something to fight back against the disease – to do as much as I can while I can. It's simple for me, you have to hit the enemy directly, so I've taken on a challenge to help support research and I'm taking part in studies.' Now, to raise awareness of dementia and vital funds for Alzheimer's Research UK, Mr Graham is heading off on a 16,000 mile cycle ride around Canada and America in April. His year-long challenge has earned the support of Prime Minister David Cameron, who praised Mr Graham's 'extraordinary grit and determination' to raise money for the charity. Mr Graham said of his brother (pictured right with his own children): 'He's in an old folk's home, he can't move and has to be fed through a tube. He can't speak but can raise a smile sometimes'. Tony is pictured with his partner Jane . Now, to raise awareness of dementia and vital funds for Alzheimer's Research UK, Mr Graham is heading off on a 16,000 mile cycle ride around Canada and America in April . Mr Graham, who is also supporting ABF The Soldiers' Charity through his cycle ride, said: 'It's going to take me a year to do it, but I hope giving one of my good years to this challenge will help give many more good years to people with dementia. 'A cure may come too late for me, but it will help my kids. We've got man to the moon, so we'll get to the answers if we put enough into it. I hope what I'm doing will help inspire people to support Alzheimer's Research UK.' He is sharing his story in the same week a YouGov survey commissioned by Alzheimer's Research UK. Early onset Alzheimer's tends to cluster within families, sometimes with several generations affected, in which case it is called familial disease. In some of these cases, it is caused by mutations in one of three genes. People with any of these extremely rare mutations tend to develop Alzheimer's disease in their 30s or 40s. These genes, and the prevalence of their defective versions  is as follows: . These mutations are extremely rare and account for fewer than one in 1,000 cases of Alzheimer's disease. It is likely that all of those who inherit faulty versions of any of these three genes will develop Alzheimer's disease at a comparatively early age. On average, half of the children of a person with one of these rare genetic mutations will inherit the disease. People who do not inherit the mutation cannot pass it on. Someone who has two or more close relatives (a parent, brother or sister) who developed Alzheimer's disease before the age of 60, is advised to ask their GP about genetic testing and counselling for these rare mutations, who can also refer patients to a geneticist, if appropriate. Source: Alzheimer's Society . This revealed that, when asked what they think dementia is and who it affects, just 23 per cent of British adults specifically mentioned brain disease or degeneration, despite a previous survey from the charity showing more than one in three people know a close friend or family member with the condition. Hilary Evans, Director at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'Chris embodies everything that goes against the dementia stereotype – he's young and fit and his zest for life in the face of adversity is truly inspiring. 'Although Chris' form of Alzheimer's is rare, the tragic consequences it has had on his relatives will resonate with thousands of families across the UK who have experienced Alzheimer's. 'Chris' situation shows how profound the impact of Alzheimer's can be – this is not forgetfulness in old age, the disease is a destructive process that takes the ultimate toll. 'Our new survey data shows we have a long way to go in dementia education. We need to recognise the physical process of Alzheimer's – in doing so we'll see that there's something real we can attack and overcome with research. 'Until we do, our own misunderstanding or prejudice risks becoming the biggest barrier to research. Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'Alzheimer's is one of the key health challenges of this generation. 'Chris has my absolute backing as he undertakes this mammoth challenge in aid of Alzheimer's Research UK and ABF The Soldiers' Charity. 'Travelling unsupported on an expedition which will see him cycle 16,000 miles around the coastline of North America, Chris is a great example of someone who, when faced with a difficult diagnosis, has shown extraordinary grit and determination to overcome his circumstances and ensure that future generations can benefit from potentially life-saving research. 'These are important causes, and I urge everyone to get involved and support Chris as he sets off on this daunting, once-in-a-lifetime journey.'

"Australian actress Rachel Griffiths says she was ‘quite elated’ when she heard a heritage-listed Catholic church in Melbourne, where horrific child abuse once took place, had been destroyed by fire. The Six Feet Under star revealed that like many of the church’s former parishioners she found it hard to even ‘drive past’ St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne’s south-east. Firefighters desperately tried to battle a fierce blaze that took hold of the 124-year-old building at around 6.30am on Monday morning but it has been left gutted. Ms Griffiths told 774 ABC Melbourne the church was plagued by ‘tragedy and complicated feelings’ and described it as being known locally as ‘the haunted house on the hill’. ‘We've all attended many funerals of boys that we now know were abused by [Father Ronald] Pickering ... and other perpetrators in the parish - at the actual church that it occurred in,’ she said. 'It's been hard for priests to really cleanse this parish, it's been very difficult to rebuild a community and we pretty much all scattered after the revelations came out and found other parishes.' Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church because of the sick crimes that historically took place inside it. Scroll down for video . Australian actress Rachel Griffiths is happy that her former Melbourne church has burned down because of its past links to a paedophile priest . Her mother stopped taking her to the church after her father left them because Pickering wouldn't have a 'divorced woman in the church'. 'I think that's probably one thing that saved our family that so many of my friends' brothers got involved with,' she said. Ronald Pickering abused boys between 1960 and 1980 while working as a priest in Melbourne . 'We stopped going because he stopped my mother at the door.' At least five people killed themselves after being sexually abused by paedophile priest Ronald Pickering between 1960 and 1980, according to research carried out in 2012. The former priest was named by the Catholic Church in 2013 as being guilty of sexually abusing children. However, after emigrating to Britain in the 1990s he was never brought to justice before he died. One victim, Raymond D’Brass, told a 2013 Victorian government inquiry that Pickering groomed him with cigarettes, money and alcohol. He was abused between the age of 9 and 13 while acting as a choir and altar boy at the church. In his statement at the parliamentary inquiry on March 4, 2013, Mr D’Brass said: ‘Over this four-year period I am aware that two other boys were also sexually abused by Father Ronald Pickering. ‘I was regularly fondled and petted by Pickering, as were other boys. This occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery. I began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with Pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol, which left me vulnerable to such abuse.’ 80 firefighters attended the scene to battle the blaze at St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east . Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church . Photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky . He recalled: ‘I now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses, as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication. In 1983, I stopped going to the presbytery after Pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming Sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father. ‘He told me that I was not welcome back and that I would burn in hell. Between 1983 and 1987, the two other boys who I know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money, alcohol and cigarettes from Pickering, but I chose not to because I was terrified of him. I have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by Pickering. ‘One night after one of the boys paid a visit to Pickering, he attempted suicide. He was unsuccessful on this attempt, but he would go on to successfully commit suicide a short time later.’ Many of the church’s former parishioners found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton after revelations of child abuse came out . The church is described as a 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church' on its heritage-listed page . The cause of the fire has not yet been established. ‘MFB will determine the cause of the fire and then if it's suspicious it will be passed on to police,’ a Victoria Police spokesperson said. More than 80 firefighters and 20 trucks were at the scene where the ancient bluestone church was fully alight on Monday morning. A caller to radio show 3AW, named Andrew, said: ‘You can hear that in the background, the roof is actually collapsing now.’ 20 fire trucks were at the scene of the fire at the ancient bluestone church . Residents watching the fire were cleared from the area because of asbestos. And a 10 metre exclusion zone was put in place around the building over fears of structural collapse. MFB spokesperson David Jarwood told the ABC the smoke could be seen from 50 kilometres away. 'It's about 50 by 40 metres apparently the blaze is, the structure, so I'm not surprised people can see a plume from Mornington,' he said. Smoke from the St James Church fire could be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge. An advice notice put out by the MFB said: ‘Emergency services are attending to building fire in North Rd Brighton. The area of North Rd and St James Brighton is currently closed and people are advised to avoid the area.’ Smoke from the St James Church fire can be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge . The church was built in 1891 and the Parish of Saint James was established a year later. In 1990 a bell tower and bells were installed at a cost of $500,000. The Victorian Heritage Database website said the church 'stands on a site which has great importance in the early history of Catholicism in Victoria as the place where the mission to Brighton was established circa 1854'. It is described as 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church, rectory and church close, mostly dating from the last century but with additions made in 1908 and in the 1920s'. It has an 'unusually elaborate 1934 decoration of the chancel with Roman mosaic flooring, opus sectile tiling and marble altars and rails. The pipe organ by Alfred Fuller of Kew, placed centrally in the rear gallery, is a rare example of his work'.","Rachel Griffiths and her family used to be members of the church .

"Former Australian radio host Mel Greig has revealed her personal torment over the prank which resulted in the suicide of a nurse in London in an interview with BBC2. Returning to radio for the first time since she and fellow 2Day FM co-host Michael Christian posed as the Queen and Prince Charles as part of a prank in 2012 to gain information about the Duchess of Cambridge following the birth of Prince George. Jacintha Saldana was the nurse who took the call, taking her life two days later and blaming her decision on the actions of the Australian radio hosts. Scroll down for video . Former Australian radio host Mel Greig has revealed her personal torment over the prank which resulted in the suicide of a nurse in London . Ms Greig, who was unable to return to her role on the air, said that she felt 'the world hated [her]' for what had happened, and spoke candidly about the grief she felt over her actions. 'I was in disgust with myself, I had failed as a human being, to be involved in someone's death is horrific and it affected me greatly,' she told BBC2 Radio listeners. The former radio host listened to a section of the original broadcast that aired in December 2012, in which she and Mr Christian asked after the well-being of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, while she was recovering at King Edward Hospital in London. Ms Saldanha, a night shift nurse sister, was in charge of the hospital and transferred the hoax call to the Duchess of Cambridge's bedside nurse. While Ms Greig said that she now understands that 'there is more to mental health...it's not normally an event like that that can trigger someone to commit suicide,' she experienced overwhelming guilt at the time. Ms Greig said she had experienced deep depression for a year, and claimed that the event had changed her life permanently. In February, Ms Greig joined other female Australian media personalities as part of a campaign to raise awareness about the abuse many women receive online, and was subjected to particularly brutal comments, in a video posted on . Jacintha Saldana committed suicide two days after taking the prank call and blamed the radio hosts . Former 2Day FM co-hosts Greig (left) and Michael Christian (right) posed as the Queen and Prince Charles as part of a prank in 2012 . Ms Greig said that the incident had changed her forever and that she felt like the 'world hated [her]' 'I've made a noose Mel, and it belongs around your neck. I can't wait to take your last breath,' one tweet read. 'You've killed a mother so it's only fair we kill yours. You'll never sleep again. I'm coming for you and your mum,' another said. A third tweet read: 'An eye for an eye. Kill yourself or I'll kill you and everyone you care about.' Last year, Ms Greig said that she believed the incident would stay with her forever, but that she has done all she can do now that she has personally apologised to her family. 'I don’t know how you completely forgive yourself – someone wrote my name in their suicide note,' she told Sunrise. 'They thought of me before they took their own life and that will stay with me forever but I can move forward from that point I think because I've tried to say sorry.' 'It was really tough but I made that promise to them over a year ago that if they wanted answers I would go to the inquest so I was always going to go,' she said. 'To be able to to look them in the eye and say sorry was incredibly hard but it’s something I felt I needed to do – everyone was very emotionally involved in that room.' Ms Greig now hopes she can try to move on with her life. 'I do have a little bit more closure and I’ve been finding it so hard to move forward and I think a lot of that had a lot to do with not being able to say sorry – just bearing that guilt and that blame,' she said. Ms Greig was part of another batch of female Australian celebrities have stepped in front of the camera to tackle the sort of vile abuse dished out online . Ms Greig leaves court in London last year, after an inquest into the death of Jacintha Saldanha . 'To know that I have done everything I can – I tried to help – I said sorry – I feel that I've redeemed myself as much as I can and I hope they got the answers to find the closure as well.' When asked how others involved in the prank had been able to put the tragedy behind them, Ms Greig simply replied that people handle situations differently. 'Some people were able to just move on from that – I wasn’t – it deeply affected me for a long time and when you are the face of blame publicly you believe it,' she said. 'As well, knowing Jacintha herself has written my name in that suicide note and blamed me directly – you hold yourself responsible.' Ms Greig spoke of how the incident had taken its toll on her over the past two and a half years. 'It took every bit of strength and every bit of support to get through that but you have a choice you can keep fighting or you can let it just take you over and I wanted to fight - life is so precious,' she said. 'I wanted to try to get better and a part of that was going to the inquest and saying sorry and helping the family out so combined I feel I’ve got everything so I can truly move forward.'","Former 2Day FM host Mel Greig returned to radio after a three-year hiatus .

"Yahoo is shutting down its research and development centre in Beijing - the firm's only physical presence in the country. The company confirmed the plans on Wednesday and the move is expected to affect between 200 and 300 employees. Yahoo said in a statement that it is 'consolidating certain functions into fewer offices' and is 'constantly making changes to realign resources.' Yahoo is pulling the plug on its research and development centre in Haidan, Beijing - the firm's only physical presence in the country. The California-based company confirmed the plans on Wednesday and the move is expected to affect between 200 and 300 employees . Employees were informed of the closures yesterday. According to reports in Bloomberg, this is said to be around two per cent of its global workforce and follows editorial job cuts in Canada earlier this month. It has also recently closed offices in Amman and Jordan. Yahoo was once the leading search engine but has lost ground to Google and more recently Microsoft's Bing. Mozilla announced in December it was ending its partnership with Google as the default option for Firefox web searches. At the start of the year it began switching people using the browser in the US  to Yahoo. The decision to switch to Yahoo came as a decade-long agreement with Google neared its end, and Mozilla 'evaluated its options', according to the firm. The partnership with Yahoo is set to last five years. A total of more than 100 billion online searches are done each year by people around the world using Firefox browsers and this is expected to increase Yahoo's market share. As of last month Yahoo accounted for 12.8 per cent of search volume in the US. Google took 64.5 per cent and Bing had 19.8 per cent. This is complicated slightly by the fact Yahoo is powered by Bing. The firm is also said to have struggled as people moved from laptops and desktops to smartphones and tablets - although Yahoo Mail is still one of the leading providers in many regions. Yahoo's profit for the quarter ending in December fell 52 per cent from a year earlier while revenue dipped 1 per cent. However, Mozilla announced in December it was ending its partnership with Google as the default option for Firefox web searches. People using the browser in the US are being switched to Yahoo. A total of more than 100 billion online searches are carried out each year  using Firefox browsers and this is expected to increase Yahoo's market share considerably.

"The footage of a man desperately hanging onto the outside of a car door while the driver swerves in and out of traffic could be straight out of an upcoming action movie. In fact, Chinese police are now hunting down the man who drove maniacally through the city of Zhenjiang - dragging along a former friend whom he owed money. With Sun Peng desperately clinging on for his life, Ren Chiang reached speeds of 50mph and drove into oncoming traffic before his terrified passenger finally let go. Dangerous: Ren Chiang drove recklessly through traffic and even sped into oncoming vehicles to try and knock off the man who he owed around £1,000 . Life-threatening: He had panicked when Sun Peng spotted him at a car wash even though he had told his former friend he was broke and homeless . 35-year-old Ren had borrowed around £1,000 from his former-friend Sun and panicked when he spotted the man he was indebted to at a car wash in eastern China, the People's Daily reported. Ren had vanished after taking the money and when his friend asked for it back he pleaded poverty and claimed he was homeless. After the life-threatening incident, Sun said: 'When I saw him driving around in a car and obviously having enough money to pay for a car wash, I realised I had been conned and went up to demand he pay me back the money he had borrowed.' But Sun had did not expect such an explosive reaction from his former friend who had put his foot down and tried to speed off. Sun added: 'I tried to grab hold of the car and found myself being dragged off down the road. 'He really put his foot down and according to the police who looked at the CCTV images we were doing 80 kph [50mph] as he tried to shake me off. 'I was begging him to stop and telling him just to let me go but he carried on, I could feel the road wearing through my shoes and I had to move my weight onto my heels as it was thicker otherwise I would have torn off the soles of my feet.'

I’m swaddled like this because, according to a new bestselling book, The Japanese Skincare Revolution, steaming your face by covering it in clingfilm is the secret to beautifully smooth and rejuvenated skin. A new bestselling book, The Japanese Skincare Revolution, says that steaming your face and covering it in clingfilm is the key to rejuvenated skin . Japanese women are renowned for their beautiful skin but, until now, no book in English has revealed the secrets of their beauty routines. Now, we can discover the joys of massage to tone the muscles of the face and natural remedies for wrinkles, sagging, oiliness, pimples and blackheads — including a step-by-step guide to the clingfilm mask. The idea is that the heat created by your breath and body warmth will encourage pores to open, so that the moisture from any water, creams or serums applied to the face will soak into the deeper layers of the skin, boosting collagen. ‘Moisture content is the most important factor in a rejuvenated complexion,’ says the book’s author Chizu Saeki, a celebrity beauty guru in Japan. ‘If skin is hydrated, it will look younger, firmer and fresher.’ She promises that her mask, which consists of water, followed by hydrating lotion, then serum — will give me an instant youth boost. If I follow it to the letter, I can wave goodbye to Botox, as water is the secret weapon in the war on ageing. Surprisingly enough, the idea does have medical backing. Frances Childs (pictured) gave the bizarre technique a try and wrapped her own face in clingfilm to see what the results were like . ‘We use clingfilm in severe cases of psoriasis to encourage cream to work at a deeper dermal level,’ says Dr Sunil Chopra, director of The London Dermatology Centre in Wimpole Street, London. Dr Chopra says healing cream is applied to the skin, then wrapped in clingfilm before being left overnight in a process called Occlusion Therapy. The heat from the body encourages pores to open and the cream to absorb, rather than just sitting on the skin’s surface. In the past year, my complexion has begun to look grey and tired. At 46, the lines around my eyes and mouth are becoming pronounced. So if wrapping my face in clingfilm helps me retain some semblance of youth, I’m willing to give it a try. Frances (pictured) bought cosmetic facial mask sheets and first soaked them in water before applying NARS hydrating fluid to the mask . Having bought a cosmetic facial mask sheet — a thin piece of cotton in the shape of a face with the eyes, nostrils and lips cut out — (£2 for 40, amazon.co.uk), I set to work. First, I soak the weird-looking facial mask in water and wring it out. Then, I liberally apply NARS hydrating fluid (£27.05, narscosmetics.co.uk) to the mask, creating a thin layer of product over its surface. ‘Hydrating fluid is a moisturising agent,’ says Dr Michael Prager, a cosmetic medicine specialist from London. ‘It contains humectant, a substance that attracts and retains water. It gathers water on and below the skin’s surface and retains it, plumping out fine lines and smoothing the complexion.’ The book also recommends that you do a quick lymphatic drainage massage to clear toxins and reduce puffiness . With the mask drenched, I pat it on to my face, where it sticks like a damp cloth. Though it’s strange, it feels pleasantly cool and less slimy and greasy than I had imagined. Now to wrap my face in clingfilm. This feels horrid and, despite having created breathing holes around my nose and mouth, I feel claustrophobic. Yet within minutes, the clingfilm is doing its job. Beneath the mask, my skin feels smooth and slippery and I’m clouding up from the humidity. I can feel the heat created by my breath. It’s not as hot as a sauna, but it’s several degrees warmer inside the mask than out. After 20 minutes, I whip off the mask as instructed. Already, my skin looks smoother and plumper. Now it’s time to rub in moisturising cream. I opt for Estee Lauder Hydrationist (£36, John Lewis), though Saeki says any cream will do because it’s how it’s applied that matters. After taking off the mask, Frances (pictured) tries to follow follow Saeki’s instructions on the art of water massage by spritzing water along the ‘muscles of facial expression’ She recommends a quick lymphatic drainage massage. Massaging lymph glands behind the earlobes, around the collarbone and under the armpits helps stimulate lymphatic flow, thus clearing toxins, she says. This, in turn, will help reduce puffiness in the face and lead to a clearer complexion. After slathering on the cream, it’s time to steam my face again — only this time, I use a wet towel heated in the microwave for 30 seconds. Beneath my warm towel, it’s dark and restful. I can almost feel the moisturiser seeping into my pores and, I hope, filling out the lines across my face. But the calm doesn’t last long. Once the towel comes off, I’m busy trying to follow Saeki’s instructions on the art of water massage. Using a spray bottle, I attempt to follow her diagram, spritzing along the ‘muscles of facial expression’ — along the forehead in a zig-zag from right to left, clockwise around the eyes and mouth, three short upward strokes along the cheeks and, finally, clockwise around my whole face. By the time I’ve finished, I’m soaking wet, with water dribbling down my face and plopping forlornly off the end of my chin. Frances (pictured) was pleasantly surprised by the results of the clingfilm facial and says she thought her complexion looked instantly softer . Onto the final leg of this marathon, and it’s time to massage serum into my face. I use Skin-Ceuticals serum (£40, amazon.co.uk), a strong, hydrating product with hyaluronic acid — an agent that encourages skin to attract and retain water. Then I massage it into my damp skin, concentrating on smoothing out the lines around my mouth and on my forehead, and pressing it into my face with upward strokes. And, finally, I’m done. The facial took half-an-hour, but it felt much longer — perhaps because I was struggling to read the instructions through the clingfilm. Nevertheless, I’m pleasantly surprised. My complexion looks instantly softer, its greyish tinge replaced by a rosy hue, and the lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished. ‘You won’t get lasting rejuvenating effects from this facial because it won’t increase collagen, which is the key to younger skin. But your face will look plumped out and smoother for 24 hours,’ says Dr Prager. However, Saeki insists her facial has a cumulative effect, so if you repeat it three times a week for three months, you can knock off a decade. The day after, I meet a friend for lunch. She demands to know if I’ve had a collagen filler. ‘You’ve done something and don’t tell me it’s just a good night’s sleep,’ she says. With a result like that, I’m willing to mummify myself every evening for the rest of the year.","We'd all like younger, fresher looking skin but it's not always easy .

"More than any other telescope in orbit, Hubble has expanded the frontiers of human knowledge. For 25 years, astronomers have used it to peer deep into distant galaxies with unrivalled clarity, revealing the breathtaking beauty of our universe. In the April issue of National Geographic, some of the most stunning images beamed back for the telescope have been revealed. The Horsehead Nebula is a cold, dark cloud of gas and dust, silhouetted against the bright nebula IC 434. The bright area at the top left edge is a young star still embedded in its nursery of gas and dust. The nebula is relatively close at 1,500 light years from Earth . Hubble has helped scientists understand how planets and galaxies form, detected black holes and changed our theories surrounding dark energy, a mysterious force that causes the universe to expand faster and faster as time goes on. The hundreds of thousands of images beamed back from Hubble have helped scientists unravel cosmic mysteries as well as estimate the age of the universe to about 14 billion years old. Among them is the Horsehead Nebula - a cold, dark cloud of gas and dust, silhouetted against the bright nebula IC 434 1,500 light years from Earth. Another remarkable image shows a display of starlight, glowing gas, and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust that forms the spiral galaxy NGC 130. This is one of Hubble's largest images ever made of a complete galaxy. Some of the most striking scenes are created during the death throes of intermediate-mass stars, when great clouds of superheated gas are expelled into space. In 2002, a dull star in an obscure constellation suddenly became 600,000 times more luminous than our sun, temporarily making it the brightest star in the Milky Way. The mysterious star, called V838 Monocerotis, has since faded back to obscurity. But observations by the Hubble Space Telescope of a phenomenon called a 'light echo' around the star have uncovered remarkable new features . This huge, young stellar grouping, called R136, is only a few million years old and resides in the 30 Doradus Nebula, a turbulent star-birth region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way . The telescope captured a display of starlight, glowing gas, and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust in this 4-foot-by-8-foot image of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 130. This is one of Hubble's largest images ever made of a complete galaxy . 'Launched into orbit aboard the space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990, amid flurries of hope and hype, the Hubble Space Telescope promptly faltered,' explained Timothy Ferris writing in April's issue of National Geographic . An iconic image from Hubble captures the dying breaths from planetary nebula NGC 6302. Known perhaps more appropriately as the Bug or Butterfly Nebula, this complex nebula lies roughly 3800 light-years away from us within the Milky Way. But at first, astronomers didn't expect Hubble to amount to much. 'Launched into orbit aboard the space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990, amid flurries of hope and hype, the Hubble Space Telescope promptly faltered,' explained Timothy Ferris writing in April's issue of National Geographic. 'Rather than remaining locked on its celestial targets, it trembled and shook, quaking like a photophobic vampire whenever sunlight struck its solar panels. 'Opening its protective front door to let starlight in perturbed the telescope so badly that it fell into an electronic coma. 'Worst of all, Hubble turned out to be myopic. Its primary light-gathering mirror, eight feet in diameter and said to be the smoothest large object ever fashioned by humans, had been figured perfectly wrong.' The telescope's design had been a compromise. While astronomers had wanted a bigger telescope in a higher orbit, they could only get 350 miles (550km) high so that astronauts in space could reach it for repairs. Next month, the telescope - which is the length of a large school bus and weighs as much as two adult elephants - will celebrate its 25th anniversary. To celebrate Hubble astronomers recently revisited one of its most stunning photos to date, known as 'the pillars of creation.' Taken in 1995, the team revealed never-before-seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young, massive stars in a small region of the Eagle Nebula, or M16. The new Hubble photo is sharper than the original, and also has a  wider field of view. It also reveals the base of the cold, gassy columns for the first time. And in January the sharpest and largest image ever taken of the Andromeda Galaxy - the nearest spiral galaxy to our Milky Way. The Hubble image shows more than 100 million stars and thousands of star clusters embedded in a section of the galaxy’s pancake-shaped disc stretching across over 40,000 light-years. The sweeping view, which reveals one third of our galactic neighbour, also suggests that the galaxy may have been battered by a collision with another galaxy two billion years ago. The panoramic image has 1.5 billion pixels — meaning you would need more than 600 HD television screens to display the whole image. It traces the galaxy from its central galactic bulge on the left, where stars are densely packed together, across lanes of stars and dust to the sparser outskirts of its outer disc on the right. 'That human beings find them to be as beautiful and evocative as photos of earthly sunsets and mountain peaks affirms anew that nature is all of a piece, and that we're part of it,' said Ferris. Some of the most striking scenes are created during the death throes of intermediate-mass stars, when great clouds of superheated gas are expelled into space.

"Lined up on stage, they have a combined wealth of almost £1billion. But these megarich leading ladies of pop banded together on Monday to demand even more money from fans. Madonna, Beyoncé, Rihanna and Alicia Keys teamed up to convince the world to fork out for a service that lets the public listen to their songs on the internet. At one point 18 of the biggest names in music took to the stage in New York to launch the enterprise, called Tidal – which guarantees them much bigger payments than rival services. Scroll down for video . Material girls: Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Madonna and Beyonce launch the online music service in New York before the backlash began . But it seems their attempts to make waves in the music industry turned into a flood... of complaints. Despite being backed by showbusiness superstars, Tidal was the most talked about topic in the world on Twitter yesterday, with thousands branding it ‘greedy’, ‘out of touch’, ‘cynical’ and ‘money grabbing’. Many critics said they felt cheated – thinking the stars had gathered to launch a new charity campaign rather than a project to swell their bank accounts even further. The music streaming service is the brainchild of rapper Jay Z, 45, who along with his wife Beyoncé, 33, is worth almost $1billion (£676million). At one point 18 of the biggest names in music took to the stage to launch the enterprise. Pictured: Usher, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Madonna, Deadmau5, Kanye West, Jay Z,  and J.Cole at the event . Streaming enables fans to listen to songs or watch music videos online, without having to buy or download them permanently on to their computers. Such services have vast libraries of songs, with one of the most popular firms – Spotify – boasting more than 30million tracks to listen to. But Spotify and other competitors provide their services for free – offering musicians a nominal amount for including their tracks on their libraries. Many of the world’s leading musicians are now starting to turn against such deals, saying they are not earning enough from them. US pop star Taylor Swift famously pulled all her music off Spotify last year. The 25-year-old wrote at the time: ‘Music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album’s price point is. I hope they don’t underestimate themselves or undervalue their art’. Tidal now offers fans a rival service, providing a huge library of music for users to listen to, but charging a minimum of £9.99 a month. On Monday, almost 20 multi-millionaire artists gathered on stage in the Big Apple to lend their support. The line-up included rap star Kanye West, 37, Nicki Minaj, 32, and Usher, 36 – along with pop royalty Madonna 56, and Rihanna, 27. British stars Calvin Harris, 31, and Chris Martin, 38, appeared via video link. Taylor Swift, left, pulled all her music off Spotify last year. Ed Sheeran, right, tweeted his 'eternal love' to anyone who owns a copy of his first album, however they got hold of it . The stars also used Twitter to raise the profile of the project using the hashtag TIDALforALL – but faced an immediate backlash online. One person tweeted: ‘I legit thought #TIDALforALL was some sort of save the world campaign, not a streaming service to make millionaire artists richer.’ Another added: ‘Something very wrong with presenting capitalistic ventures like #TIDALforALL as social justice movements.’ A third wrote: ‘I’m still mad about #TIDALforALL! Those “artists” are filthy, money grabbing, selfish, disgusting human beings! It makes me mad...’ Tidal is a markedly different approach to that taken by some other artists. In 2012, British newcomer Ed Sheeran tweeted: ‘Eternal love for anyone that owns a copy of ‘+’ [the name of his first album], however you got hold of it, legal or illegal, thank you for enjoying it’. In 2007, the band Radiohead released their album In Rainbows online and allowed fans to pay whatever they wanted for it. Speaking in New York, singer Alicia Keys said she hoped the Tidal service will ‘forever change the course of music history’, adding: ‘Our intent is to preserve music’s importance in our lives’.

"An Indian news network ran a blank screen for an hour in protest over a government decision to ban a documentary about the savage gang-rape of a Delhi student. NDTV broadcast the static image - showing just a flickering candle and the words 'India's Daughter' - between 9pm and 10pm on Sunday. It was due to have shown the documentary, about a physiotherapy student who died after being savagely attacked and raped on a bus, to coincide with International Women's Day. But just days before its broadcast India obtained a court order banning the film on the grounds it risked fuelling public anger. NDTV ran a blank screen - featuring only a candle and the title of the documentary - for an hour  in protest over a government decision to ban a documentary about the savage gang-rape of a Delhi student . The documentary included a chilling interview with Mukesh Singh, one of five men convicted over the 2012 attack in New Delhi, who said: 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy.' Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the comments in which Singh blamed the 23-year-old victim were 'highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women'. The channel has made no public comment, but its editorial director Sonia Singh tweeted ahead of the screening: 'We won't shout but we will be heard.' The ban triggered a storm of protests in India and many people welcomed NDTV's move. Rifat Jawaid tweeted: 'Well done NDTV for deciding to go off air for one hour... Very innovative and powerful.'

Tushar Gandhi, the great grandson of India's independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, added: 'Wish I could post a blank tweet in solidarity with NDTV's protest.' India's Daughter, by award-winning British filmmaker Leslee Udwin, was due to be shown in seven countries including India and Britain on Sunday. The BBC brought forward its showing of the film to Wednesday after India announced its ban, citing intense public interest. The father of the victim has said everyone should watch the documentary, which showed 'the bitter truth' about attitudes to women in India. The father of the victim, who died of injuries sustained during the shocking attack, has said everyone should watch the documentary. Candle-lit vigils were held throughout India to commemorate her death . Officials at the jail where Singh is being held said they had asked the BBC not to show the documentary, claiming Udwin had violated the terms of the agreement allowing her to interview the prisoner. But Udwin said on Monday she had complied fully with the agreement. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a vocal champion of women's rights in India, has so far made no comment on the row. On Sunday he urged an end to all forms of discrimination against women, tweeting that 'our heads hang in shame when we hear of instances of crime against women'.","NDTV ran a static image of a candle between 9pm and 10pm on Sunday .

"Islamic State have released their most boring and uninspiring propaganda photos on social media today, revealing gardening as one of the little known past time shared by their supporters. The dull photos appear to be an attempt by the brutal extremist group to show an interest in the environment and other calmer activities.

"A principal has claimed radicalisation is not a problem at his Islamic school because he tells pupils that the Islamic State death cult is manufactured by Western countries. Al-Taqwa College Principal Omar Hallak reportedly shows his almost 2,000 students ‘evidence’ that Islamic State terrorists are ‘not linked to Islam’. ‘We don’t believe Muslims are creating IS,’ Mr Hallak told The Age. He believes that the murder and brutality carried out by Islamic State terrorists is actually a plot by Western countries to control oil in the Middle East. The school, which is based in Melbourne’s outer-west, Victoria, is focussed on educating Australian Muslims that ‘follow Australian Law’, he said. ‘In the mosque, we talk to them many times. We show them evidence it's not linked to Islam,’ Mr Hallak explained. Al-Taqwa College Principal Omar Hallak reportedly tells his pupils that Islamic State is a plot manufactured by Western countries . He said his Islamic school in Melbourne doesn't have problem with radicalisation . The principle’s belief that IS is simply a plot caused by Israel and America stems from his theory that the terrorists use ‘shiny new equipment’. Al-Taqwa College is an independent primary and secondary school. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Hallak for comment. A spokesman for the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia Keysar Trad told Fairfax Radio on Monday the principle was just trying to discourage young people from joining the terror group. 'I can understand anyone taking offence to being in any way implicated in the type of crimes that IS has been reported to have done,' Mr Trad said. 'But in the bigger picture scheme of things, the real issues are that we have to find as many ways as possible to convince young people to keep away from this group and have negative feelings towards this group.' Instead of criticising the principal for blaming the West, Mr Trad said the principal should be told 'we appreciate what you're doing, but we don't need the ""us and them"" approach'. Abdullah Elmir, a 17-year-old Australian who went missing from his home in Sydney’s west at the end of June 2014, is fighting with Islamic State terrorists . Mr Trad said IS had done an 'unprecedented level of damage' to the image of Islam. He said there was a minority view that it was 'a plot from forces outside of Islam', either the West or Syria's Asad regime. Mr Hallak's remarks come after more than 100 Australians are thought to have flown to Syria and Iraq to fight with the Islamic State terrorists so far. Radicalised teens include Abdullah Elmir, a 17-year-old Australian who went missing from his home in Sydney’s west at the end of June 2014, and Melbourne school boy Jake Bilardi. The 18-year-old died in a suicide mission in central Iraq last week after travelling to Iraq with a ‘death wish’ last year after dropping out of school. Schoolboy Jake Bilardi was killed in a suicide bomb in Iraq last week after becoming radicalised online in Melbourne . On Sunday night his devastated father John Bilardi told 60 Minutes that it was clear his son suffered from psychological problems from an early age, but that they were never properly addressed, despite the fact all the warning signs were there. 'I would just like everyone to know that the buck stops here with me. He was my son. I knew there was something not right with his behaviour,' he said. The teenager is believed to have converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10, shortly after his mother died of cancer. 'Just out of the blue he said, ""I've gone Muslim"",' his father said. 'To see him sitting there with that gun... I just couldn't believe that was my son,' Mr Bilardi said about the photograph of his son holding a rifle, flanked by other IS members, in front of the terrorist group’s black and white flag. Suhan Rahman, from Melbourne, is said to have died last week while fighting for Islamic State . His wife posted a bloodied photo of her dead husband on Twitter. A rifle was placed on his body . The woman who claimed to be Rahman's wife said: 'I'm the most content I have ever been in my life.' A researcher at the London based terrorist research centre ICSR posted this photo of Rahman on Twitter . 'They put him in a car loaded with explosives. They probably just shouted 'praise Allah' or whatever, and sent him off. I can't imagine what he was feeling.' Other young men who have travelled from Melbourne to join Islamic State include Suhan Rahman and jihadi Mahmoud Abdullatif – both of whom are also now dead. A woman claiming to be Rahman’s wife posted a photo of his bloodied dead body on Twitter, announcing that he has been killed while fighting in Syria. Rahman, who had been fighting under the name Abu Jihad al Australi, previously threatened a terrorist attack on Australia claiming he would 'bring the war home' to the west in January. ‘Spill blood young Aussies,’ he wrote on Twitter. His last known location was Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold in Syria. The woman, named Zumarul Jannah, who claimed to be his wife said: ‘Alhamdulillahi rabbil alimeen, I'm the most content I have ever been in my life ♡.’ 23-year-old Rahman (left) was pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar (right) earlier this year . Australian-born jihadist Mahmoud Abdullatif, who was reported dead in January, was friends with Rahman . A Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5, which they said originated in France . Zehra Duman, pictured, left behind a distraught family when she fled for the Middle East late in 2014. She later posted that she had married jihadist fighter Mahmoud Abdullatif . His death came after his friend Abdullatif, nicknamed the playboy jihadi, was killed in January. Abdullatif’s wife Zehra Duma, also from Melbourne, similarly announced her husband’s death on social media. She recently shared a series of propaganda pictures that she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen. In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?' Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.' Her father, Duvat Duman, told the Herald Sun: 'She’s been brainwashed, she wasn’t like this three or four months ago.' Other Australian jihadis, who are wanted by the Australian Federal Police, are Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar. Both men famously published photographs of themselves on Twitter showing them holding up decapitated heads.

"If you're single and struggling to find a girlfriend, you might want to consider a change of profession. Because a study has found that women are more attracted to men who display heroic traits such as war heroes, successful sportsmen and firemen. However, the study found the opposite wasn't true, and men did not find heroism to be a sexually attractive trait in women. Phwoar: A Study by the University of Southampton says women prefer war heroes. They are also attracted to other heroic professions like being a fireman. However, men prefer women to not be in a heroic profession. 'Only males seem to benefit from displaying heroism,' said Dr Leunissen from the university . The study was carried out by the University of Southampton and published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour. In the research 92 women studying in the UK were presented with hypothetical profiles of the opposite sex, representing varying levels of heroism in different contexts such as warfare, sport and business. They were then asked a series of questions designed to determine how attracted they were to the different profiles. Women were more likely to find a soldier attractive, and were more inclined to date him, if he had been awarded a medal for bravery in combat. Ladies should behave like men if they want to work in male-dominated industries, according to a controversial study. Research by Professor Ann Marie Ryan, a psychologist at Michigan State University, suggests recruiters prefer more masculine traits to those commonly associated with women. She asked women to apply for leadership roles in male-dominated industries such as engineering in front of a panel of volunteers asked to evaluate the candidates' suitability. Some of the women were asked to emphasise 'masculine-like' traits such as assertiveness, independence and raw ambition. Others were asked to display more 'feminine traits' - warmth, supportiveness and a nurturing nature. The panel, irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it, decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process. But whether or not a non-decorated soldier had seen combat in a warzone or remained in the UK did not have a statistically significant effect on his attractiveness. Displays of heroism in other fields, such as in sports or in business, also had no effect on how likely women were to find them attractive. In a subsequent experiment by the researchers, 159 women and 181 men studying in Holland took part in a similar exercise to determine their level of sexual attraction to the opposite sex. This time, the soldier profiles displayed various levels of bravery, either in combat or by helping in a natural disaster zone. Again, heroism in combat increased women's levels of sexual attraction towards male soldiers, but heroism in a disaster zone had no impact. Female heroes, both in combat and in disaster zones, were deemed less attractive by men than their non-hero counterparts. 'This provides evidence for the hypothesis that gender differences in intergroup conflict can have an evolutionary origin, as only males seem to benefit from displaying heroism,' said Dr Joost Leunissen, a psychologist at the University of Southampton. 'In light of the physical dangers and reproductive risks involved, participating in intergroup aggression might not generally be a viable reproductive strategy for women. 'Heroism also seems to be a context-specific signal, as it only had an effect on attractiveness in a setting of intergroup conflict. 'Indeed, soldiers who displayed heroism were only considered to be more attractive when this was displayed in a warfare context and not in another situation which is frequently associated with the army - helping during and after natural disasters.' Hot stuff: Being a fireman (stock image shown) was one profession rated as being attractive by women in the study. However, Displays of heroism in other fields, such as in sports or in business, also had no effect on how likely women were to find them attractive . The experiments follow on from a historical analysis undertaken by the research team, which looked at numbers of children fathered by US Medal of Honor recipients in the Second World War compared to the numbers of children fathered by regular veterans. The analysis shows Medal of Honor recipients had an average of 3.18 children, while regular veterans averaged 2.72 children, suggesting decorated war heroes sired more offspring than other veterans. 'Raids, battles, and ambushes in ancestral environments, and wars in modern environments, may provide an arena for men to signal their physical and psychological strengths,' said Dr Leunissen. 'Of course, women may not always witness these heroic acts in person, but such information is likely to be widely communicated within a tribal community, particularly when the actions of male warriors are outstandingly brave.' The study team was made up of researchers from the University of Southampton, UK; University of Giessen, Germany; Technical University of Munich, Germany; and VU University Amsterdam, the Netherlands.","Study by University of Southampton says women prefer war heroes .

"A Chinese man who has been left with a memory that lasts just five minutes has found the only way he can cope is to continually write down every detail of his life in a precious notebook. Chen Hongzhi, 25, from Hsinchu county, Beipu, suffered a serious head injury in a car accident when he was a teenager which has left him with virtually no memory, The People's Daily reports. He writes down everything - from the people he meets in the street to the weather - as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day. Memory book: Chen Hongzhi uses the notebook to write down people he meets and what he does each day after being left with a five-minute memory following a car crash . Chen suffered the severe brain injury in a car accident when he was 17 and spent months in intensive care in hospital. While his body recovered, his memory loss is still so severe that he often forgets things that happened between five and 10 minutes ago. The debilitating condition also means that Chen cannot remember how to write properly, so he makes notes in a phonetic 'scrawl' that mostly only he understands. 'This is my record, I write in it everyday, even if it is pouring down with rain or if I don't go out to do the weeding I still l must write, ""Heavy rain"",' he said. 'Whenever I get home from any time away  I quickly grab my notebook and write down important things from the day - who I've met, what I've done, how much money I got from recycling bottles, all that sort of stuff.' Life record: Chen writes down everything from the people he meets in the street to the weather as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day. He has even developed his own language . Dependants: Chen Hongzhi with his mother Wang Miao-chiong, who starts the day by handing Chen his notebook and reminding him he is no-longer 17. They are reliant on each other following the recent death of his father . Every day when Chen wakes up, his mother, Wang Miao-chiong, must remind him that he is no longer 17 and eight years have passed. She hands him the notebook so he can read what has happened in his life since the accident and check important details like who his friends are and what needs to be done that day. Chen's story has spread online in China after it was compared to that of the fictional character played by Nicole Kidman in the film Before I Go to Sleep. His condition means Chen is unable to hold down a job so he raises a small amount of money by walking several kilometres collecting plastic bottles. Chen also collects wood that he and his mother use to make a fire to cook their food. His mother, 60, said the practical system has kept Chen going for years, but she worries about what will happen to him after she has gone, particularly given the recent death of his father. Guide to life: Chen Hongzhi, 25, has had to write everything down after he suffered brain injuries that left him with a five-minute memory, when he was 17 . They get by on donations from neighbours and friends in the tiny village in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu County, who have given Chen the nickname 'short memory man' because he forgets having met them within 24 hours. She said the family had initially hoped he would go back to school but soon realised there would be little point. 'It had been planned that would go back to school but there was no point as he could never remember the lessons, and has been living at home with me ever since.' Before the accident: Chen poses with a pony before a car accident left him with very little memory . Hard worker: Despite having very little memory, Chen collects firewood for his family to use in the stove . The pair are totally dependent on each other, with Chen having his mother there to reassure him about who he is and he, in turn, provides the physical strength to earn the money and carry out the household chores. A severe hit to the head can injure the brain and cause both short and long-term memory loss. Memory is easily damaged by brain injury because there are several structures in the brain are involved in processing information, storing it and retrieving it. Damage to those parts of the brain can result in memory loss. Head injuries can trigger memory loss of the period immediately after the accident. A person can appear to be relatively well, but everyday memory for events or conversations can be interrupted. They can also forget the time from before the brain injury – called retrograde and anteretrograde amnesia – and the gap in memory will range from a few minutes to a few months. But the most common – and the most troublesome - type of memory loss is short term memory loss. This can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Examples of this are forgetting what has just been said, having difficulty in learning a new skill, repeating the same question over and over, forgetting people's names, getting details mixed up, forgetting a change in routine and forgetting where things have been placed. There is no guaranteed cure for this type of memory problem, and rehabilitation will try to help a person cope using tried and tested strategies. However, memory is not like a muscle that can be developed just by stretching it. Source: Headway: The Brain Injury Association . After the death of his father, he was forced to step up his bottle collecting activities, where he was spotted by a traveller who was fascinated by his story, and posted on social media where it quickly spread. Beipu village chief, Liu Chin-ting, said the family receives monthly support from Hsinchu County's social welfare department, which is helping the family to get by. Welfare workers also make it a point to visit Chen and his mother during festive holidays, he said. But Liu said he believes the boy could still have a future if there was a medical facility that was prepared to take in and give him proper physiotherapy and training. He said: 'He needs to get some preparation because his mother won't be there forever, and maybe they can get to the point where he can even hold down a regular job'. The family have been flooded with offers of people wanting to send money but Chief Liu, who is helping to negotiate, said what they really need now is is practical everyday donations like tissue paper, rice, salt and soy sauce. He said: 'Once the basics are sorted out, perhaps it might be possible to look at taking the time to find something more for the mid-term and long-term, but at the moment they just need to survive.' Chen meanwhile is clearly happy, as his diary notes that kind donations of money have been flooding in and he's very happy that people want to help. He knows he is destined to forget everything, but also knows that nothing he can do about that except keep his sense of humour. He said: 'I am reading here about all the people that want to give me money, but I would say don't give me too much, because it looks as if I'll probably forget where I put it all.' In the film Before I Go to Sleep, 40-year-old Christine Lucas, played by Nicole Kidman lives a life where she wakes up every day forgetting what has gone on the day before. In a remarkable similarity, she has to remind herself by writing notes each day about what has happened to her since the car accident. Alike: Chen's story has led to comparisons between himself and Holywood blockbuster Before I Go to Sleep (2014), starring Nicole Kidman as Christine Lucas and Colin Firth as Ben Lucas .","Car crash left Chen Hongzhi with severe brain injuries and little memory .

"The Chancellor used this week's Budget to announce the first above-inflation increase in the threshold for the higher rate of tax . George Osborne is expected to pledge to accelerate increases in the 40p income tax threshold if the Conservatives win the general election. The Chancellor used this week's Budget to announce the first above-inflation increase in the threshold for the higher rate of tax, which has sucked in ever-more middle-class families, in seven years. But yesterday economists said that even after the latest rise, the decision to limit increases had left millions out of pocket. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said higher-rate taxpayers will be £535 worse off in 2017-18 than they would have been had the threshold risen in line with inflation since 2010. Those earning up to £100,000 have benefited from repeated increases in the 20p threshold, but not as much as the 26million basic-rate taxpayers. Mr Osborne persuaded reluctant Liberal Democrat colleagues to agree that the higher-rate tax threshold should rise gradually from £41,865 this year to £43,300 in April 2017 as he sought to woo voters ahead of May's election. He is now expected to use the Conservative election campaign to say he would go faster if the party wins outright. The Chancellor says he wants to deliver a threshold of £50,000 for higher-rate tax and £12,500 for the basic rate. The IFS said yesterday that higher-rate taxpayers were feeling the pain from the Coalition's earlier decisions to cut the threshold for paying 40p and then increasing it by less than inflation. The think-tank said the threshold would need to rise to £48,650 by 2017 to ensure that higher-rate taxpayers had not lost out since 2010. Robert Joyce, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: 'Higher-rate taxpayers will be £535 worse off because the point at which you start paying 40p income tax has been reduced in real terms significantly over this Parliament.' But he said basic-rate taxpayers will be £597 a year better off by 2017-18 because of increases in the personal allowance – the point at which income tax of 20 per cent kicks in. Mr Osborne says he wants to deliver a threshold of £50,000 for higher-rate tax and £12,500 for the basic rate . The Coalition has already raised the personal allowance from about £6,500 to £10,000 and it is due to hit £11,000 in 2017. Mr Osborne said the planned increases in the 40p threshold in the coming years – which could be reversed by an incoming Labour government – were a modest 'downpayment' on Tory plans to raise the threshold to £50,000 by 2020. David Cameron vowed last year to end the scandal of so-called 'fiscal drag', which has seen millions of people dragged into higher rates of income tax by below-inflation increases to thresholds. The number of people paying 40p tax has risen from around three million to five million since 2010 and is due to keep rising. The IFS, the leading independent expert on tax and spending issues in Britain, has estimated that one in four taxpayers could be hit over the coming decade. But it has warned that such a large increase in the threshold 'might be politically difficult for a government to go ahead with' given the likely backlash among voters. The Tories have so far refused to say exactly where the money will come from to fund an increase in the 40p threshold to £50,000 by 2020. The policy has been opposed by Labour and the Lib Dems. Critics called on all political parties to raise the threshold at which the 40p tax rate kicks in. One leading tax adviser said the 40p rate of income tax 'was not intended to be a tax on people who you would hardly say are earning a fortune'.","Chancellor detailed in Budget first above-inflation tax rise in 40p threshold .

"National dressage competitor Tahley Reeve-Smith shares a quiet moment at her stables in Hertfordshire . For anyone with a passion for horses, it’s as close to paradise as you’re likely to find. Not only does Keeper’s Cottage offer a charming family home, it also boasts stables, a tack room, paddock, Olympic-size manege (training area) and five-and-a-half acres of land to ride on. It’s no surprise then to learn that its current owner is a successful rider and trainer who has horses galloping through her veins – national dressage competitor Tahley Reeve-Smith has represented England and is currently being trained by 2012 Olympic Gold medal winner Carl Hester. And the love of all things equine doesn’t end with her – Tahley’s family are horse-mad too. ‘Even on my mum and dad’s wedding day they went off and bought a horse!’ she says. Tahley’s determination to compete is so strong that she has even taken to the saddle with a broken leg. ‘I was at an event and a horse trod on my leg,’ she says. Her leg was later immobilised with a plaster cast, but that wasn’t going to stop her. ‘Two weeks later I got a letter asking me to represent England. So I got in the bath and got my cast all wet and soft and pulled it off. I put a bandage on and managed to get into my boots. My leg swelled up horribly but I won a bronze.’ Tahley and husband John bought Keeper’s Cottage, near the village of Great Munden in Hertfordshire, eight years ago when they were looking for the perfect place to bring on their best horse, the appropriately named Special. Since then they have resurfaced the manege, making it perfect in all weathers, increased the number of stables to seven, and installed mirrors and floodlights so a rider can always see how they look as they practise. Tahley, who is also a dressage judge, uses the manege to train novice horses and riders. Keeper’s Cottage itself is an attractive and spacious home – the red-brick house has three bedrooms, a study, family room, drawing room, dining room and office. And there is planning permission for two more bedrooms and a sitting area. ‘It’s a really characterful house,’ says Tahley. ‘You always find new things, like a switch you didn’t know existed.’ Tahley has to cross only one quiet road and then she can go hacking for two hours and not see another. The only interruptions might be steering around a herd of deer. Yet this is Hertfordshire, and Keeper’s Cottage is close to the A10 and not far from the A1 and M25. On to a winner: Keeper's Cottage, near Great Munden, has seven stables and is on the market for £1.1million . As well as boasting seven stables, the family cottage has a tack room, paddock, Olympic-size manege (training area) and five-and-a-half acres of land to ride on . Keeper’s Cottage itself is an attractive and spacious home – the red-brick house has three bedrooms, a study, family room, drawing room (pictured), dining room and office . Special has taken Tahley to the verge of representing the country again and she will soon be competing in the British Dressage Championships at Hartpury in Gloucestershire, near Carl Hester’s yard. She says Keeper’s Cottage and its facilities have really benefited Special, adding: ‘The horse completely chillaxes because of the whole environment.’ But however special Special is, no horse could top Tahley’s first, a New Forest pony called, again appropriately, Topper. ‘He would throw me, take me into rivers and roll with me on his back, buck me off and reverse back over me so I would find hoof-prints on my clothes.’ Price: £1.1million . Location: Near Great Munden, Hertfordshire . Bedrooms: 3 . Unique features: Stables for seven horses, tack room, paddock, Olympic-size floodlit and mirrored all-weather manege . Tahley rode throughout her childhood and says she used every spare minute she had at school to get homework done so she could spend time with horses. And when she and her sister Shelly didn’t have a horse to ride, they would sit on 35-gallon drums and pretend they were horses. The sisters’ love of anything equine seems only natural since they wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for horses. ‘My dad says he fell in love with Mum when he used to watch her climbing over the gate to feed her horses at my grandmother’s stables,’ Tahley says. Tahley’s father Justin was renting a house near the riding school in Hertford. A physicist by training, he used to run a company in the metals industry but loved being around horses so much that, in his mid-30s, he retrained to become a farrier, and later became qualified as a fence-builder for showjumping. Tahley’s mother Susan had less of a conversion – spending all her life around horses has led her to become an expert on horse bloodlines, their potential and breeding, and she has found future champions for Tahley. Tahley and John are leaving Keeper’s Cottage to be closer to Shelly and Susan, who has 35 acres of land. They will run a horses’ yard while Tahley continues to compete in dressage and train other riders. ‘I’ve loved living here,’ she says. ‘It’s been the best thing ever for my career.’ mullucks.co.uk, 01279 755400 .","England dressage rider is selling family cottage and stables for £1.1million .

"With just six weeks to go until the birth of her second child, you’d expect all eyes to be on the royal bump. But it was the Duchess of Cambridge’s gleaming hair that was the star when she went to Westminster Abbey this week. The secret behind her glossy chestnut locks is said to be an organic vegetable-based salon treatment to boost colour and shine. But can you get the look at home? From rinsing with fizzy water to a home-made strawberry and mayonnaise mask, we tried the DIY tricks to boost dry locks. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge (pictured) is said to use an organic vegetable-based salon treatment to boost colour and shine. Can we recreate the glossy effect at home using DIY remedies? ADD FIZZ TO YOUR RINSE WITH SPARKLING WATER . Perrier Sparkling Water . WHY? Apparently used by Hollywood actress Demi Moore, this is highly recommended by Paolo Lai, at Neville Hair & Beauty in London’s Mayfair. ‘Fizzy water is excellent at creating shine as the low pH level — or high acidity — combats frizz by smoothing the hair’s cuticle. Perrier is one of the most acidic, so I suggest trying that,’ he says. TEST: I wash my hair as usual before braving the Perrier rinse, which is actually refreshing. I drench my hair thoroughly, but only use a third of the bottle. Though I have few expectations, the finish is almost that of a professional blow dry. EXPERT: ‘This sounds like an urban myth, but the cold, acidic water will flatten the cuticle of the hair, smoothing down the surface and allowing light to bounce off,’ says consultant trichologist Iain Sallis. GLOSS RATING: 6/10 . GOLDEN OIL TO SLICK DOWN FRAZZLED LOCKS . Nuxe Gold multi-purpose dry oil for body and hair . Nuxe Gold multi-purpose dry oil for body and hair, £14, escentual.com . WHY? Containing borage, sweet almond, hazelnut, St John’s wort, camellia and macadamia plus vitamin E, this dry oil leaves skin feeling soft, supple and hydrated, but, according to the blurb on the bottle, works just as well on hair. TEST: It looks as though a child has mixed olive oil with glitter and shaken it up. I use sparingly on washed and dried hair, nervous I’ll look greasy rather than groomed. The slightly cloying sweet-smelling oil smooths on well and the golden particles catch the light and make my hair look expensively shiny. EXPERT: ‘A dry oil forms very small molecules, which are better absorbed by the hair than a wetter product,’ says Iain. GLOSS RATING: 7/10 . MASK MADE IN YOUR KITCHEN . Hellmann's Mayonaise and fresh strawberries . Strawberry and mayonnaise mask . WHY? Home-made hair treatments using strawberries are the talk of many beauty websites. The soft fruit is acidic and good at regulating oil production in the scalp, say converts. The best and simplest recipes involve mashing a few fruit with a moisturising ingredient like mayonnaise. TEST: The smell of mayonnaise and strawberries makes me feel faintly nauseous. I’ll be honest, keeping mayo-coated lumps of strawberry on your head for ten minutes isn’t pleasant. Thankfully, it’s not too hard to wash off. There are chunks of strawberry in the shower, but the mayonnaise doesn’t leave my locks greasy. My hair is a bit softer, but it’s a lot of effort for little gain. EXPERT: ‘The acidity of the strawberries will seal the cuticle, but you’d be better off just using a professional product,’ says Iain. GLOSS RATING: 5/10 . WAKE UP HAIR WITH A CAFFEINE SHOT . Recoffee hair care range . Recoffee range, from £17.25 for the shampoo, o-right.co.uk . WHY? It’s claimed the coffee oil in this haircare range — each bottle of shampoo contains oil extracted from 16 cups of recycled coffee grounds — treats dry ends. The caffeine is said to stimulate hair growth. There’s also organic silicone for a glossy finish. The bottle, made of recycled coffee waste, can be planted as there’s a coffee bean in the base. TEST: I’m all for a latte, but using a shampoo and conditioner smelling of coffee beans is a first. Afterwards, I apply the transparent oil. It’s a leave-in treatment, applied before drying. I use the oil sparingly but after a rapid blow dry, my hair looks almost polished. It holds this sleek look all day, without greasiness (though my hair is flatter than usual) and friends say how groomed I look. EXPERT: ‘This range could be great for dull, frizzy hair as coffee is mildly acidic, which means it will smooth the hair cuticle,’ says Iain Sallis. ‘But the effects will be temporary.’ GLOSS RATING: 9/10 . BRILLIANT BOAR BRISTLE BLOW DRY . Rock & Ruddle boar-bristle brush . Rock & Ruddle boar-bristle brush, £20, rockandruddle.co.uk . WHY? ‘Boar bristles are strong and resilient, with microscopic scales running along them,’ says Rock & Ruddle co-founder Alexandra Rock. ‘These drag the hair’s natural sebum [oil] down the shaft so that it looks shiny and healthy.’ WHY? I blow dry my hair with my usual ceramic brush until almost dry, then use the boar bristle brush to smooth it down. I never thought I’d feel strongly about a hairbrush, but this is excellent. It cuts through tangles with ease and leaves my hair shiny. A blow dry in a brush. EXPERT: ‘Boar bristles are similar in structure to our own hair, and the cuticles will interlock with our own cuticles and push them down into place,’ says Iain. GLOSS RATING: 9/10 . HOME-MADE GLITTER GODDESS . Papermania embossing powder in tinsel gold . Papermania embossing powder in tinsel gold, £4, hobbycraft.co.uk and hairspray . WHY? The rumour is that Lovelace star Amanda Seyfried’s shiny hair is down to her hairdresser using a ultra-fine glitter powder mixed with hairspray. TEST: A stylist friend suggests mixing gold glitter (the sort used for Christmas cards) with hairspray. I sprinkle some on my hair, follow with a blast of Elnett spray then add another sprinkle of glitter. The resulting effect catches the light pretty well (quite a lot falls off onto the kitchen floor too). A good party look and it washes out pretty well. EXPERT: ‘More fancy dress than enhancing hair health,’ says Iain. GLOSS RATING: 5/10 . ICE YOUR DO . Home-made glycerine spray, Wilton Glycerine, £2.59, lakeland.co.uk . WHY? I am told about making your own glycerine and water spray by a friend who swears blind that it will make my hair Photo-shop shiny. TEST: Glycerine, added to hair products to add moisture, is also used in royal icing, and I have some in the cupboard. I shake up four parts water to one part glycerine then spray it on my hair. Here’s the surprising thing — it gives a groomed finish. A bit more and the final look is over-greasy for everyday glamour, but I can see it would work well for photos. EXPERT: ‘Be very wary — hair can go from shiny to greasy in the blink of an eye if this is over-used,’ says Iain.

"A former candidate for Delaware's Senate accused of molesting a young neighbor more than 25 years ago has pleaded no contest to unlawful sexual contact. Eric Bodenweiser entered the plea Wednesday in Sussex County Superior Court. It comes nine months after a judge declared a mistrial in the case when jurors could not agree on a verdict. No contest: Eric Bodenweiser, a former candidate for Delaware's Senate, was accused of molesting a young neighbor more than 25 years ago. He pleaded no contest to unlawful sexual contact on Wednesday . A retrial had been scheduled for April in Kent County. Bodenweiser was charged with multiple counts of unlawful sexual intercourse and unlawful sexual contact and could have been sentenced to life in prison if convicted. The charges to which he pleaded no contest are punishable by up to one year each in prison. The News Journal reported that Bodenweiser entered the pleas for 'two counts of third-degree unlawful sexual contact.' According to the newspaper, prosecuting attorney John Donahue said Wednesday in court the allegations involved a boy under the age of 16.

"A mansion which was hailed as Scotland's most expensive new home and advertised for £8million has been sold for less than £1million. Prospective buyers were told The Whitehouse at Gleneagles in Perthshire was a bargain despite the massive asking price when it was put on the market three years ago. The luxury home in an exclusive gated communities within the grounds of the Gleneagles Hotel and Golf Resort was described as a 'Great Gatsby-style' mansion with a blend of Georgian and Art Deco styles. The five-bedroom Whitehouse (pictured) was billed as 'Scotland's most expensive new home' and advertised at £8million (artist's impression) When building of the luxury home stalled after a buyer could not be found, the house sold for a knockdown price of just £861,888 . The 13,000sq ft mansion was planned to come complete with its own swimming pool, orangery, soundproofed cinema, three-car garage and more than half an acre of garden. It was marketed to rich foreign golf fans but failed to attract a buyer and development work on it stalled before it was repossessed by a bank in 2013. Property records show it has now been sold to a local businessman for a knockdown price of £861,888. Part of the package includes free membership of the Gleneagles resort for two years, including golf and use of the luxury facilities. The five-bedroom luxury home was set to feature a s wimming pool, orangery and soundproofed cinema - but has yet to be completed . Property records show the Whitehouse has now been sold to a local businessman for a knockdown price of just £861,888 . The mansion is in the grounds of the world famous Gleneagles Hotel and Resort which boasts three championship golf courses . The house was expected to be ready for occupation ahead of the 2014 staging of the Ryder Cup match between Europe and the USA at Gleneagles. But as it was never completed last year estate agents Savills slashed the price to offers over £750,000 - one of the biggest price reductions in Scottish property history. When it was first advertised John Coleman, a partner with selling agents Smiths Gore, said despite the property's daunting price tag there should be no problem in attracting potential buyers across the globe. He said at the time: 'Not only is it architecturally stunning with state-of-the-art finishes and is a golf lover's dream, but at £500 per square foot it is a relative bargain, compared to other luxury properties worldwide which go for ten times that. 'In Hong Kong, the average price of luxury property is almost £7,000 per sq ft and in Mayfair in London sales are achieving £5,500 per sq ft. 'We are looking at people who want to buy something special at a golf hotel resort. 'Everything will be top spec. This is about buying the very best of what Scotland has to offer on the very best golf resort. We think, in world terms, this is good value for money.' The Whitehouse was the most expensive of the 14 homes planned to be built on Queen's Crescent - an exclusive gated community within the Gleneagles resort. Each of the plots was sold off for around £1m by the hotel owners. The house was meant to be ready for occupation ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup match between Europe and the USA at Gleneagles . The world-famous hotel in Scotland has three championship courses, the King's Course, the Queen's Course and the Centenary Course as well as the nine hole 'Wee Course'. When it was opened in 1924, Gleneagles was described as 'a Riviera in the Highlands' and 'the eighth wonder of the world'. It most recently hosted the 2014 Ryder Cup which saw Team Europe beat Team USA 16½ to 11½ to complete a hat-trick of successive wins in the tournament. The hotel was built by the former Caledonian Railway Company, with its own railway station just minutes away, and is now owned by Diageo plc. In 1919 The King's and Queen's courses opened on the same day, but  The King's but was only nine holes until it was completed as a full 18 in 1925. When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the hotel closed and became a military hospital and then a miners' rehabilitation centre. It reopened as a hotel in May 1947. In 1993 the PGA Centenary Course, created by Jack Nicklaus, opened to complement the renowned King's and Queen's courses and form one of the world's finest golfing venues. The house was supposed to be ready for occupation ahead of the 2014 staging of the Ryder Cup match between Europe and the USA .","The Whitehouse at Gleneagles was billed as 'Scotland's most expensive new home' and advertised at £8million .

"More than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation . Royal Mail has stepped up the amount of junk mail it stuffs through our doors since it was sold off by the Government, new figures show. More than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation – sparking fears that it risks becoming a ‘leaflet distributor’. In the 12 months after privatisation, postmen pushed almost 50,000 more leaflets and advertising letters through our doors every single day, compared to the previous year. It means almost 3.2bn items of ‘unaddressed’ junk mail were delivered in just one year – almost double the 1.7bn delivered annually five years ago. These figures do not even include the vast quantities of ‘addressed’ junk mail also delivered, which have the names of occupants on the envelope. The rise in unsolicited mail has proved lucrative for Royal Mail, which is struggling from increased competition in the parcels market and a fall in the number of ordinary letters being posted. Revenue from ‘marketing mail’ – addressed and unaddressed – has soared to £1.1bn a year, earning them £3million a day. Critics last night called for Royal Mail to reduce the amount of ‘nuisance’ junk mail it delivers or risk becoming a ‘leaflet distributor’. Royal Mail admitted junk Mail had become an ‘important component’ of its business, and insisted many households found advertising flyers ‘useful’. But much of unwanted junk mail is never opened and ends up being thrown straight into the bin – causing an environmental headache. While some households recycle takeaway menus and pamphlets, many tonnes of junk mail end up in landfill – costing councils tens of millions of pounds to dispose of. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: ‘Junk mail is a blight on the nation’s doormats. ‘Not only is it a nuisance to pick up and throw away, it adds thousands of tonnes to the waste councils have to pick up creating additional costs for tax payers. ‘Royal Mail and its direct marketing clients have to do far more to reduce the torrent of junk mail.’ Robert Rijkhoff, of the Stop Junk Mail campaign, said marketing mail was ‘the worst form of advertising’ because it was foisted upon households without their consent. He said: ‘Royal Mail needs to make money but, if they deliver more and more junk mail as a source of income, in the long term I am not sure it is a sustainable business. ‘Royal Mail is delivering less and less letters. They are risking that, in time, they will become a leaflet distributor.’ Critics claim that some junk mail contain scams sent by fraudsters from overseas. Critics said the company was running the risk of being labelled a 'leaflet distributor' with fewer letters being posted every year . In 2011, the National Fraud Authority claimed the Royal Mail logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy, making the scammers appear more trustworthy. At the time, Mike Haley, director of the National Fraud Authority, Royal Mail and other delivery firms needed to ‘understand the terrible consequences of delivery of this mail to some people’. Royal Mail said the rise in marketing mail was due to the improved British economy, as companies found they had more money to advertise their goods and services. A spokesman said: ‘Marketing mail is mail like any other – it is our job to deliver the mail. Companies use direct mail because it has proven results. ‘Many households find the information useful. Three in five people have acted in response to a piece of advertising mail in the last 12 months as a direct result of receiving door-to-door marketing material.’ As people increasingly stop posting letters in favour of email and text messages, Royal Mail said marketing mail was an important source of income. It said profit from this junk mail was important to ensure the survival of the universal service – its obligation to deliver to every address in Britain, six days a week, for the same price. They added that revenue from marketing mail helped to ‘keep UK stamp prices among the best value in Europe’. Despite this claim, first and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on March 30, sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging revenue. The news sparked accusations from MPs that Royal Mail had taken the ‘easy option’ to raise stamp prices instead of fighting for new custom by improving its services. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the influential Business Select Committee, said Royal Mail must invest in new technology and focus on efficiency, rather than simply increasing prices to boost profits.","Almost 3.2billion items of 'unaddressed' junk mail were delivered last year .

"It was a memorable night for Interstellar and Kingsman: The Secret Service as the 20th Jameson Empire Awards celebrated another 12 months of cinema in London on Sunday evening. Helmed by British director Christopher Nolan and starring Jessica Chastain, Interstellar walked away with two of the night’s biggest prizes – Best Film and Best Director for Nolan. Both were in attendance at Park Lane’s Grosvenor House, but their overwhelming success on the night was matched by that of the British spy-caper. Scroll down for video and full list of winners .

The latter went to rising star Egerton, whose filming commitments as Eddie ‘The Eagle’ Edwards in a biopic about the former skier saw him miss the event. But while the actor was unable to collect his award in person, co-star Mark Strong was on hand to bestow the Best Thriller award – won by The Imitation Game – to Alex Lawther.

"A jury is recommending life without parole for an Alabama woman convicted of capital murder in her granddaughter's running death. Jurors rejected prosecutors' pleas for a death sentence for Joyce Hardin Garrard in the February 2012 death of 9-year-old Savannah Hardin. The decision came on a split vote: seven for life, five for death. It came Thursday on Garrard's 50th birthday. Under Alabama law, a vote of at least 10 of 12 jurors was required for the panel to recommend death. A simple majority could recommend life. Life: Joyce Hardin Garrard was found guilty of capital murder last week by a jury that today voted 7 to 5 to imprison the 50-year-old for life rather than put her to death for running to death her granddaughter Savannah Hardin in February 2012 . Horrific: Savannah collapsed and had a seizure after carrying wood as Garrard refused to let her stop running. She died three days later in hospital . The verdict is only a suggestion under Alabama law. Circuit Judge Billy Ogletree will make the final sentencing decision at a hearing May 11. The same jury convicted Garrard of capital murder last week. The jury began deliberating late in the morning after prosecution and defense attorneys presented closing arguments in the sentencing phase of Garrard's trial. Assistant District Attorney Marcus Reid asked jurors to recommend the death penalty, adding that he's never prosecuted a case like this one. 'This case is the only case I know of where the perpetrator forced the victim to participate in her own death,' he said. 'Joyce Garrard forced Savannah Hardin to help kill herself.' Prosecutors contend Garrard made the girl run as punishment for telling a lie about candy, and refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise. In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson. Reid told jurors that Garrard had cried in the courtroom at the mention of her birthday, but didn't cry when jurors were shown the soiled blue pants Savannah was wearing the night of her collapse. 'Savannah is dead. Joyce Garrard is pitiless. She doesn't believe she did anything wrong,' he said. Over some candy: Garrard forced Savannah to run around the house and carry wood as punishment for a lie about eating candy in February 2012 . While grandmother Joyce Hardin Garrard was in the yard verbally prodding 9-year-old Savannah Hardin to run and pick up sticks, witnesses and attorneys said, stepmother Jessica Mae Hardin watched idly from a distance, seemingly immersed in her laptop computer. And with Savannah struggling to keep going and near the point of collapse, Hardin went inside so she wouldn't have to keep watching the girl's torment, a prosecutor suggested. Later, it was Hardin who called 911 and told authorities the girl had collapsed and was having a seizure, but only at Garrard's direction. Savannah died within days in a hospital after being taken off life support. Garrard (left) and Jessica Mae Hardin (right), Savannah's stepmother, were arrested in February 2012.  Harden has also been charged with her murder, for allegedly sitting by as Garrard ran the girl to death, which carries a life sentence . Prosecutors portrayed Garrard as a domineering grandmother who controlled Savannah's punishment despite the advice of a counselor, but they say Hardin shares blame, too. Authorities contend Hardin, who was married to Garrard's son Robert, should go to prison for failing to help her stepdaughter during the child's ordeal on Feb. 17, 2012. Her refusal to come to the girl's aid is tantamount to murder, the state has argued. Hardin, 30, has pleaded not guilty. She is free on $150,000 bond awaiting trial while prosecutors concentrate first on Garrard, charged with the more serious offense of capital murder. No trial date is set for Hardin, who was pregnant when Savannah died and gave birth while in police custody following her arrest. Defense attorney Dani Bone stood beside the jury box holding a small, dark rock and reminded jurors that in old times, the jury would participate in the execution by throwing rocks at the condemned. He said they have a right to say, 'I ain't throwing that stone.' 'If you can't throw that stone, be the first one, then don't,' he added. Garrard's family and friends had pleaded Wednesday for jurors to spare her life after, calling her a loving grandmother who endured an abusive childhood that included being beaten by her own grandmother. Garrard, of Boaz, testified last week she had no intention of harming the girl and denied she had forced her to run. Garrard said during cross examination that Savannah wanted Garrard to help her get faster for races at school, and they both ran 'a bunch' before Savannah collapsed. Savannah Hardin mother , Heather Walker (right), told the court that she believes her ex-mother-in-law deserves the death penalty . Heather had not seen daughter Savannah in the year before her death, as she moved out of state to live with her father and stepmother. Jessica says she repeatedly sent things, which would be returned to sender to her . Bone argued that Savannah wouldn't want her own grandmother put to death. 'Joyce loved Savannah, that's been proven. Savannah loved Joyce, that's been proven,' he said. He said circumstances made it especially hard to condemn her to death. 'There is no comparison for this one because it is the first one of its kind ever. You people will be setting the bar.' Because Thursday was Garrard's birthday, deputies allowed her to hug relatives across the short wall that separates the front of the courtroom from the spectators before court opened in the morning. Joyce embraced her husband Johnny Garrard for several minutes, rubbing his back and the back of his head as she and her relatives wept. Afterward, she sat down at the defense table and stared at her son and Savannah's father, Robert, who was in the courtroom for the first time. He sat directly behind the prosecution table and did not appear to return the eye contact.","Joyce Hardin Garrard forced her granddaughter Savannah Hardin to run to the point she died in 2012 .

"One of the teenagers who was captured on video as she violently beat up a fellow classmate at a Brooklyn McDonald's claims she and her friends had been planning the attack for months. Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested ten times, told authorities that she and her friends were planning to go after the 15-year-old victim because she had 'done something to a very close friend.' Ferguson was seen laughing and smiling as police led her to a car in handcuffs on Thursday. This as two more girls who were involved in the fight have been apprehended, including one 15-year-old who was taken off a plane in Atlanta as she attempted to flee the country for Jamaica. Three of the girls involved still remain at large. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested six times since last July, was held for the McDonald's attack . She was seen smiling and laughing as she was led away in handcuffs on Thursday . She is facing up to 25 years in prison for attacking a 15-year-old girl . Graphic cell phone footage emerged of the brutal attack on Tuesday . The two girls apprehended today include a 15-year-old girl was accompanied by her mother as she turned herself in, and the aforementioned 15-year-old who was trying to get out of the country. The New York Daily News reports that authorities had been alerted to her travel plans. As for Ferguson, her most recent arrest came last month when she stabbed her brother in the arm, and last year she was arrested after she punched her grandmother in the face and a month later when she injured an officer while resisting arrest. Despite this, her lawyer, Sarah O’Leary, is pleading for leniency now that she is being held on $500,000 bail, saying; 'She was making some efforts to better things in her life.' Ferguson, who belongs to the Young Savages gang, could be looking at 25 years in prison. The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her and has been getting support from thousands on social media. The 15-year-old wrote on Wednesday; 'Everyone Like I'm Famous Now.' On Thursday, Ferguson detailed the reason for the fight with police, saying it had been in the works since January, and that it all began when she got a call from a male friend letting her know that the victim was at McDonald's. She then left her friend's house and waited for her other friends outside the fast food chain, and once they arrived the group 'put the beats on her.' After the beating was done, Ferguson said she was 'still mad,' and that is why she began kicking the victim's head as she lay motionless on the ground. She then took her purse, make-up bag and phone and claims she threw them in the trash as she walked out. The victim, who also has links to a gang according to the New York Daily News, continues to not cooperate with police. 'That type of behavior is not acceptable in our society,' said NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said. 'Certainly is not going to be acceptable here in New York.' The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her and mock the media response to the fight . The 16-year-old in the fight (left) who was stripped to her bra has been arrested, while the girl being picked on is so weak at the end that she collapses on a bench . The graphic cell phone footage emerged earlier this week of the brutal attack  that took place after class on Monday afternoon. The three minute clip showed an unfair fight that began with the victim  being set upon by six other students. As the girl is mercilessly pummelled by the gang her blonde hair extensions are ripped from her head as she is repeatedly punched and kicked. The vicious fight is cheered on by dozens of other youths who jockey for a good view of the senseless violence. The video, posted on Facebook, captures the afternoon brawl at a McDonald’s  near Erasmus Hall High School on Flatbush Avenue. Despite being outnumbered, the small girl gives as good as she gets and at one point she pulls a black hoodie off one of her attackers to reveal a bra. Towards the end of the video - which has been shared more than 19,000 times and viewed more than 740,000 - the smaller girl is left cowering under a table. Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off. Bystanders can be heard saying, 'She’s dead,' and, 'You murdered her.' A few students then intervene, pick the small girl up and sit her on a nearby bench. Immediately she collapses and so the students help her to lie down. Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off . 'The message has to be sent very clearly, that this kind of violence will not be tolerated whether in a mall or in restaurants and those involved should turn themselves in to authorities immediately so as to face the consequences of their violent actions,' said Brooklyn community activist Tony Herbert. Anyone with information about the fight is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1-800-577-TIPS.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Arrest: Jennifer Perry, a first-year high school teacher, allegedly had sexual contact with a student . A 27-year-old married teacher has been arrested for allegedly engaging in a sex act with a 17-year-old student after she told the school there were 'false' rumors going around that they'd had a relationship. The school contacted authorities and Jennifer Marie Perry, from Odenville, Alabama, surrendered to the Jefferson County Jail on Monday and has been charged with sexual contact with a student under 19. Perry, who was in her first year of teaching at Pinson Valley High School, is accused of meeting the student at a parking lot a few miles from the campus on February 8 and engaging in a consensual sex act inside a car. She did not teach the boy but attends church with him and his family, said Sergeant Jack Self of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. She is believed to have known him before working for the school, he added. On February 23, she wrote a letter to school administrators and told them there was a false rumor going around school that she had sexual contact with a student. The school launched an investigation and found reason to believe the rumor was in fact true, Sergeant Self said. When they met with her on February 24, they said they would be passing their findings on to the school board and local authorities, and she handed in her resignation. The sheriff's office launched an investigation that day and spoke to the alleged victim as well as other students. Perry was not willing to speak with them, Sergeant Self said. Double-life: Perry met her husband, Blake (pictured) in their freshman year of high school and married in 2011. She did not teach her alleged victim but knew him and his family through church, authorities said . Authorities obtained a warrant against Perry and she turned herself in on Monday but was later released after posting $30,000 bond. She is now awaiting trial. Authorities believe the incident was a one-time occurrence, Sergeant Self said. The family of the alleged victim, who know Perry and her family, expressed their relief that she had been arrested, Sergeant Self said. Perry married her husband, Blake, in May 2011, according to Facebook. They met when they were freshman in high school and have been together ever since, she wrote on a bio on the school's website. They now live together with their three dogs. She is a graduate of Jacksonville State University and was in her first year of teaching at the school, according to the bio. She is listed as a ninth-grade English teacher. Probe: She wrote a letter to officials at Pinson Valley High School saying there was a false rumor going around about the incident. The school launched an investigation and they allegedly found evidence that it did occur . 'I am incredibly excited to be spending my first year as a Pinson Valley Indian spreading my love of literature with students,' she wrote. Speaking to AL.com, Chief Deputy Randy Christian expressed his shock that Perry had successfully navigated the competitive process of achieving a teaching job just to throw it away. 'It's also kind of amazing they believe it's possible a teen will keep their little secret,' he said. 'The school administration is to be commended for taking immediate action. That was helpful to us in bringing this to a close.'","Jennifer Marie Perry 'met the student at a parking lot a few miles from the school's Alabama campus and engaged in a sex act with him in a car'

"Ashley Parkes (above) sent a fake bomb to the manager of a Boots store on the anniversary of the 7/7 London terror attacks last year. He was given a suspended sentence for 18 months at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday . A Boots worker who sent a fake bomb to a store on the anniversary of the 7/7 London terror attacks has been spared jail. Ashley Parkes attached a chilling note to the rectangular package, which read: 'Handle with care - bombs explode.' Police were alerted and a store in Leeds, where the parcel was delivered last year, was evacuated until experts examined the package. They quickly discovered it was a hoax and only contained hair dye and blue tissue paper, Nottingham Crown Court was told. The 26-year-old, who worked in a Boots warehouse at the time, admitted dispatching a parcel with the intention of inducing a belief that it was likely to explode or ignite and cause personal injury or damage to property. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. Judge Michael Stokes QC , sentencing, said: 'Sending you immediately to prison would perhaps misrepresent the seriousness of what you did. 'In the present day society anybody who produces a package and even pretends it is a bomb is creating a great deal of trouble and potential risk to innocent people. 'It had been a pathetic attempt by Parkes but it still resulted in a store being evacuated and a great deal of public expense and inconvenience to a large number of people.' Julia King, prosecuting, told the court Parkes sent the hoax bomb after seeing a film on YouTube of gravestones being desecrated. She said: 'It affected him and that was why he acted in the way he did.' Ms King added that the manager had been left shocked and nervous after the incident. The Boots store in Leeds had to be evacuated and experts were called in to examine the package. Above, a stock image of a Boots store in the UK . The court heard Parkes, of Bestwood, Nottingham, has mild learning difficulties and is on medication for depression. Steven Gosnell, defending, acknowledged it was a peculiar case and said Parkes was never intending to cause injury. He said: 'Parkes, who lost his job, did what he did on the spur of the moment and has apologised.'","Ashley Parkes sent the rectangular package to a Boots store in Leeds .

The books and series also led Mr Morris, a former RAF officer, to file a lawsuit in 2013 challenging Dr Magnanti's version of events. He claimed her stories were based on her sex life with him. But in what is likely a legal first, Dr Magnanti's legal team had launched a counter-claim at Edinburgh's Court of Sessions, VICE reported. They are set to argue that claiming she had never worked as a prostitute is defamatory. Mr Morris, who is known only as ‘The Boy’ in the books, pursued damages for defamation and breach of privacy against Dr Magnanti after the release of her books, who has a PhD in Forensic Science. Dr Brooke Magnanti's (pictured left, with Billie Piper) has filed a counter-claim to ex-lover Owen Morris's suit claiming her books were based on 'fantasy' Soon after their relationship ended in 2008, he claimed her books - The Intimate Adventures Of A London Call Girl, in 2005, and The Further Adventures Of A London Call Girl, in 2006 - were 'fantasy'. Writing on blog Sexonomics at the time, she said: 'I have no choice but to defend this. But am happy to do so even though it will almost certainly mean losing everything I have even when I win.' She took to her blog to vehemently deny his allegations, insists her blog and the resulting books are true. A statement from Dr Magnanti's legal team to Vice said: 'I can confirm a counter-claim has been lodged. 'I have been advised by my QC to offer no further comment pending the resolution of this litigation.'","Dr Brooke Magnanti's past life working as an escort made her a fortune .

"New rail routes and improved lines using 140mph trains to slash key journey times by up to 40 minutes are unveiled today as part of the Chancellor’s multi-billion pound plan to ‘revolutionise travel in the North’. Journey times between Leeds and Newcastle could be cut to 50 minutes - compared to a best time now nearly an hour and half ( 87 minutes currently) for cost of between £8.5bn and £14.0bn, says a new report to be published in Liverpool by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin. The 140mph trains could reduce the Liverpool to Manchester journey times to around 20 minutes – but cost as much as £13billion. The new routes, shown here, will slash journey times by up to 40 minutes- with travel time between Leeds and Newcastle cut to 50 minutes - compared to a best time now nearly an hour and half for cost of between £8.5bn and £14.0bn . Another plan to reduce journey times between Sheffield and Manchester from the current 48 minutes to 27 minutes could cost as much as £19billion. But sceptical rail unions dismissed the Government’ ideas to boost transport in the North as: ‘yet more pie-in-the-sky nonsense’. The new Government plans are part of the Chancellor’s ‘ Northern Powerhouse initiative to link ‘the great cities of the north’. It builds on the Government’s HS3 idea – high speed lines from East to West across the North to link with the controversial £50billion high speed HS2 line going from London in the South to Birmingham and then onto to Leeds and Manchester in the North. New rail routes and improved lines using 140mph trains to slash key journey times by up to 40 minutes are unveiled today . The so-called ‘TransNorth’ rail network would link Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle and Hull – with sections capable of speeds up to 140mph - Journey times between Liverpool and Manchester could be as low as 20 minutes; Manchester to Sheffield and Leeds could both be 30 minutes; Leeds to Hull could be just 45, and Sheffield to Hull 50 minutes. Journey times from Manchester to Newcastle could be cut by a quarter (25%). The report by the Government and the regional quango Transport for the North includes studies by Network Rail setting out for the first time the different options for creating such a network along with indicative costings running to billions of pounds . Plans set out in the report include: slashing journey times between major northern cities with investment in high speed rail; developing new east-west road connections including a road tunnel under the peak district; and introducing Oyster-style smart travel cards and simpler fares across the North. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (left) has backed the investment but Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, (right) claimed it was just more 'pie-in-the-sky nonsense' The Chancellor George Osborne (above) claimed the report had the potential to revolutionise transport in the North . A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Options range from radically upgrading existing routes to building completely new lines.’ Transport Secretary McLoughlin Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Transport Secretary McLoughlin and Northern city leaders are backing the first ‘Northern Transport Strategy’ report following work by Network Rail work on rail improvement options. The department for Transport said: ‘The report sets out a long term strategy to connect up the north, create a single economy and allow northern towns and cities to pool their strengths. ‘ The Chancellor and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin are in the North West today  to launch the report. The proposed new routes: . The proposed upgrades: . Mr McLoughlin is today at the Port of Liverpool’s container terminal L2 before joining the Chancellor on a visit to Stockport . They will also announce the go-ahead of the A6 to Manchester Airport Relief Road. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘No government has given such attention to the infrastructure of our great northern cities and how to deliver a world-class, integrated transport network for the north. The proposals announced today will reduce journey times while increasing capacity and connectivity, enabling growth.’ Chancellor Mr Osborne said: ‘This report has the potential to revolutionise transport in the North. ‘From backing high speed rail to introducing simpler fares right across the North, our ambitious plans for transport means we will deliver a truly national recovery where every part of the country will share in Britain’s prosperity.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘All of this will ensure the North can race ahead in a stronger economy and doesn't become one big bottleneck.’ But Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: ""This is yet more pie-in-the-sky nonsense from the Government on the so called Northern Powerhouse when in reality transport services across the region in the real world are lumped with clapped-out, overcrowded trains with any replacement programme light years off.’","New rail routes are announced in plan to ‘revolutionise travel in the North’

"Rumours were swirling Moscow last night about the health of Vladimir Putin who has not been seen in public for more than a week. The Russian President had been due to make a visit to Kazakhstan this week but an official there said it had been cancelled because he was ill. Mr Putin also failed to appear at an annual meeting of high-ranking officers from the Federal Security Service today, an event he has attended in past years. Scroll down for video . Last public appearance: Vladimir Putin with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Russia last week . It was claimed the crisis over Ukraine and murder of an opposition politician may have caused a collapse in Mr Putin's health. But another theory, advanced by the lawyer of murdered Boris Nemtsov, was that the strongman may be lying low because he is 'afraid' of an assassination bid. Rumours: The Ukraine crisis may have contributed to a collapse in Putin's health, it has been claimed . Putin loves to be seen as an ever-present action man, but the Russian president has been absent from public view for a week. The 62 year old's unusual absence has dented his tough-guy image. His aides scrambled to explain he was healthy and his macho handshake remained so strong 'it breaks your hand'. Putin was last seen in public when he met with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on 5 March. Official pictures have emerged of meetings since then, but rumours say these in fact took place earlier before his sudden and unexplained disappearance. Nemtsov's lawyer claimed Putin may be scared over the high profile murder yards from the Kremlin, suggesting the Russian leader maybe in hiding fearing an assassination bid. 'Perhaps Putin, even completely sincerely, was bewildered and even afraid,' said Vadim Prokhorov. 'Because if you can do that next to the Kremlin, then is it not possible to do it along the route of the presidential motorcade?' Spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the health speculation over Putin as 'spring fever'. The leader was 'holding meetings all the time' to solve the 'crisis'. 'There is no need to worry. Everything is fine,' said Peskov, not explaining why Putin did not make an appearance to disarm the rumour-mongers. The spate of speculation over his condition recalled regular health scares over his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, and a clutch of geriatric Soviet leaders.","Putin's visit to Kazakhstan was cancelled because he was ill, official said .

"Hillary Clinton has been hammered time and time again for the scandal which erupted after it emerged that she used her personal email account for government business. But she made light of the scandal at a gathering of reports on Monday night, looking forward to 'new beginnings'... including a new address. Clinton, who is expected to declare her bid for president in the coming weeks, even promised 'no more secrecy' after weeks of being pressed to turn over State Department emails she had hitherto kept to herself. Joker: Hillary Clinton showed her lighter side, joking with reporters about her recent email scandal, and promising 'no more secrecy'. She is pictured about at a speech earlier on Monday . The former Secretary of State and First Lady, who was speaking at the awards ceremony for a political journalism prize, admitted it was odd for her to willingly put herself in the way of the press - but tried to spin the occasion as a fresh start. She said: 'I am well aware that some of you may be a little surprised to see me here tonight. You know my relationship with the press has been at times, shall we say, complicated.' '... But I am all about new beginnings. A new grandchild, another new hairstyle, a new email account – why not a new relationship with the press? 'So here goes. No more secrecy. No more zone of privacy - after all, what good does that do me.' Prank: Clinton joked that everyone at the prize-giving in Washington, D.C., had a non-disclosure agreement under their seat . However, she couldn't help but indulge her secretive side, even in jest, by pretending the guests would all be stopped from talking about the event with a legal gagging order. She said: 'But first of all, before I go any further, if you look under your chairs, you’ll find a simple non-disclosure agreement. My attorneys drew it up. Old habits... last.' She was speaking at a ceremony held for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, which is awarded by Syracuse University. The event in D.C. honors Robin Toner, a political reporter who died in 2008, but interviewed Clinton several times in the preceding decades. Dan Balz, a Washington Post reporter, won the $5,000 prize this year. The event could be one of Clinton's last public appearances before announcing her much-anticipated candidacy for president in 2016. At one point in the her remarks at the event she seemed to make a joke about her longstanding position that she is still considering whether to run or not. It came on the day that Ted Cruz became the first to throw his hat into the ring and announce himself as the first official candidate in the presidential election. Other Republicans, including Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Rand Paul are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks.","Former Secretary of State made light of accusations over her emails .

"Ros Altmann, the Government's Business Champion for Older Workers, is releaseing a major report next week . Tens of thousands of women over 50 are being left on the jobless scrapheap years before retirement because they are forced to care for elderly, sick or disabled people in their family. In total, up to 600,000 late middle-aged women are unemployed and looking for work, costing the economy up to £20billion a year. The startling new figure is released today as Dr Ros Altmann, the Government's Business Champion for Older Workers, ahead of a major report next week setting out the steps needed to end the crisis of older people shunted out of work years before retirement. It will highlight caring responsibilities as one of the major barriers preventing women in their 50s and 60s from staying in work. Almost one in four women aged between 50-64 care for elderly, sick or disabled people – with some 153,000 women approaching retirement claiming Carers Allowance – compared to just 87,000 men. The caring responsibilities are hitting women's job prospects – with the employment rate among 50-64 year old women just 63.7 per cent compared to 74.5 per cent for men. Speaking ahead of the launch of her report on Wednesday Dr Altmann told MailOnline: 'We need to harness the potential of older female workers, and provide support for those who would like to work, but feel unable to do so. 'Caring responsibilities can often take women out of the workforce – but if businesses could accommodate more flexible working, often just for a short period, many more women could keep in touch with work and the employer would retain their invaluable experience.' A YouGov poll recently commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions shows that older women would prefer part-time work as they approach retirement. Some 43 per cent of women who are not retired said the best way to retire would be to cut down to part-time or flexible hours before stopping work altogether. Pensions Minister Steve Webb said it was 'essential' for the economy to get more women into work . Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: 'This analysis shows how supporting older workers to stay in jobs is an essential economic priority for the UK. 'The Coalition Government has taken bold action and is turning the tide, but there is more to do – particularly to help older women combine work with caring responsibilities. 'Business in Britain needs to realise the potential of all older workers and take action on this. In the past we were too quick to write people off in this country once they reached a certain age, but the world has changed.'","Exclusive: 600,000 older women unemployed and looking for work .

"Nick Clegg's election campaign went from the sublime to the ridiculous today, as he travelled from a meeting with the Queen to a hedgehog sanctuary in Solihull. The Lib Dem leader was introduced to Humpty, a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles. Mr Clegg was told the animals have a lifespan of just five years, which he might be able to relate to as his party face the prospect of being booted out of government for the first time since 2010. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg and Lib Dem candidate Lorely Burt were introduced to Humpty, a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles . Mr Clegg donned his wellies for a yomp around Parkridge Centre, part of the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust in Solihull. The election campaign officially got underway when David Cameron to tell the Queen that Parliament has been dissolved. Mr Clegg then made his own trip to the Palace for a separate private audience - as Lord President of the Privy Council he has an obligation to do so. He then headed to the Midlands for what was billed as a campaign visit on the NHS, in a seat the Lib Dems are fighting to hold. But he donned his wellies for a yomp around Parkridge Centre, part of the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust in Solihull. Humpty the hedgehog got his name after falling off a wall and suffering head injuries. Mr Clegg, who last week revealed his dream to make wildlife documentaries, spoke to children about a new scheme to protect hedgehogs. They were introduced to Humpty, a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles. Mr Clegg insisted that his 'plucky party' can defy the polls and declared the era of single-party politics is over . Later he insisted that his 'plucky party' can defy the polls and declared the era of single-party politics is over. The Lib Dem leader said that in the '50 or 60' seats where his party had an MP or an effective presence on the ground they were doing far better than opinion polls suggested. On a visit to Solihull, a knife-edge marginal with a Lib Dem majority of just 175, he said people would hear his party's side of the story during the campaign. On a visit to the Brueton Park nature reserve in the constituency, the first stop of the campaign tour, Mr Clegg insisted his 'plucky party' could defy the polls. He said: 'What you have got to ask is how are we doing in those 50, 60 seats where we have MPs, we have campaigners, we have councillors. 'There, the picture is completely different to the national snapshot polls because there people hear the LIberal Democrat side of the story - which is one we are very proud of - which is about a plucky party stepping up to the plate back in May 2010 when the country desperately needed it.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg left Downing Street shortly after Mr Cameron before his own meeting with the Queen . The mud-soaked visit to the Midlands was a long way from his final visit to Buckingham Palace. Speaking before visiting the Queen this morning, Mr Clegg told reporters: 'It is my view that the era of single-party government is now over in British politics.' He said the Tory/Lib Dem coalition formed in 2010 was a 'historic government' which was formed at a time of 'national economic emergency' and had got the economy growing again. 'About the very last thing the country now needs is a lurch to the left or the right and yet that is exactly what the Conservative and Labour parties are now threatening,' said the Liberal Democrat leader.","Lib Dem leader starts the day meeting the Queen at Buckingham Palace .

"The BBC has backed Top Gear over Jeremy Clarkson’s use of the word ‘pikey’. The word - used as a derogatory term for gipsies or travellers - was part of a ‘running gag’ between Clarkson and fellow presenter James May about their colleague Richard Hammond’s perceived cheap style. A complaint was lodged by the Traveller Movement charity after it appeared on a placard in a Top Gear episode from February last year. Top Gear hosts: The word 'pikey' was part of a ‘running gag’ between Jeremy Clarkson (right) and fellow presenter James May (left) about the perceived cheap style of their colleague Richard Hammond (centre) The BBC Trust acknowledged that the word ‘pikey’ derived from ‘turnpike’ and so related to Travellers in a ruling due to be published today. But the Trust’s Editorial Standards Committee said there had been ‘no intended racist reference’ by the Top Gear team. The ruling stated: ‘The committee believed the word “pikey” had evolved into common parlance among a number of people to mean “chavvy” or “cheap” and … viewers would not necessarily associate it with the Gipsy and Traveller communities.’ But a Traveller Movement spokesman told the newspaper: ‘We are horrified by the BBC’s green-lighting of the use of the word “pikey” by the Top Gear presenters. Embattled presenter: The future of Clarkson (pictured leaving his house in London yesterday) at the BBC is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in North Yorkshire . Ruling: The BBC committee said it ‘accepted that the word “pikey” did have the potential to be deeply offensive to the Gipsy and Traveller communities’ (file picture) ‘The claim that it has evolved a new meaning and that most people do not realise it has any reference at all with Gipsies and Travellers is absolute rubbish.’ The word 'pikey' is believed to have been used as early as the 16th century. But it was not seen in print until 1837, when The Times used it to describe strangers who visited the Isle of Sheppey. The actual origins of the word are unclear. It could be connected to the word 'turnpike'. These were toll roads, which had rotating barriers made of sharp poles called pikes - and vagrants were known to gather in these areas in the 18th century. An alternative version of the word is 'piker', which is said to have come from the verb 'to pike' - which once meant to run away. Now, the word is used as an insulting term towards gipsies - who have claimed in recent years that it is the equivalent of calling a black person a 'n*****'. It is also used in the modern day as a term to insult someone of supposedly low class. The BBC committee said it ‘accepted that the word “pikey” did have the potential to be deeply offensive to the Gipsy and Traveller communities’, but it cleared the programme of wrongdoing. Clarkson’s future at the BBC is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in North Yorkshire. He now faces an interrogation over his row with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon by BBC chiefs, who are said to be ‘desperate’ to get rid of him. Ken MacQuarrie, head of BBC Scotland, is leading an inquiry into the fracas and is expected to deliver a verdict within days. Last night Clarkson was at the centre of another controversy after he said in the March edition of Top Gear magazine that foreign taxi drivers in London have ‘vehicles smelling of sick’. He also turned on drivers in the North, saying northern roads are overrun with immigrants ‘who have never experienced tarmac before’. The inflammatory comments follow a string of racism rows. Last year, Clarkson apologised after he was filmed allegedly using the N-word in the poem ‘Eeny, meeny, miney, moe’. Shortly afterwards, he used the racist term ‘slope’ in a show about Burma. The racing driver who was The Stig on Top Gear for eight years has said that the BBC show could thrive without the embattled Jeremy Clarkson. Ben Collins fell out with the broadcaster when it launched legal action - which it failed to win - over his decision to reveal his identity and publish his autobiography. He told Radio Times magazine that the presenter was not supportive of him in his own clash with the corporation. And he said that the BBC2 show could continue to succeed without him. Claim: Ben Collins (left), the racing driver who was The Stig (right) on Top Gear for eight years, has said that the BBC show could thrive without the embattled Jeremy Clarkson . The stuntman stated: ‘Top Gear has achieved huge status and Jeremy has certainly been part of that because he’s got such a big personality... he’s an unstoppable force. ‘But fans of the programme love it for lots of different reasons. Jeremy is certainly one of them, but not the only one,’ Collins, who was The Stig until 2011, said. ‘The Bond franchise.... changes and moves forward. Top Gear will always continue.... It will carry on and continue to be successful because millions of people watch it.’ Mr Collins said that it had become harder for the show ‘to reinvent itself’, as it was ‘possibly starting to strain under the weight of its own success’. Meanwhile, Perry McCarthy, who was The Stig from 2002 to 2003, said that Top Gear without Clarkson would take ‘the fire out of it’ and ‘won’t work’. ‘I think you’re going to have a diluted product. I don’t think it will have the value that it did, here and overseas’, he said. ‘And God help any soul who takes his place, because that’s like signing up for your own firing squad. The only person who could take it on would be somebody who has nothing to lose.’","Word became part of 'running gag' between Clarkson and James May .

"Mother-of-two: Jodie Emery (pictured outside Preston Crown Court) allegedly had her front door broken down at home in Lancashire . A jilted lover sent his ex-girlfriend a threatening text message before breaking down her front door three minutes later and stabbing her friend in a jealous rage, a court has heard. Jason Taylor, 21, was allegedly convinced Jodie Emery, 26, was dating another man, telling her: ‘Last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there.’ Then he suddenly broke down the mother-of-two’s front door at her home in Preston, Lancashire - and, armed with a knife, began grappling with Adam Wilson, 25, who had been invited round for drinks, the court was told. Miss Emery - whose two young daughters were asleep upstairs - allegedly tried to stand between the pair in a bid to split them up, but Mr Wilson was left with a fatal thigh wound. The victim - who was barely known to meat factory worker Taylor - was taken to hospital but bled to death before doctors could save him. Preston Crown Court heard yesterday that the incident occurred on September 22 last year at 11pm - just two weeks after Taylor had split with Miss Emery after an eight-month relationship. The couple had earlier been on a summer caravan holiday in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, but on their return Taylor was said to have become upset when he discovered Miss Emery had terminated a pregnancy. Two days before the killing Taylor was at a local pub where he allegedly became so convinced Miss Emery was seeing someone else that he smashed a window and tried to punch a man who had once dated her. He was also constantly texting and phoning Miss Emery and would go to her house and sit outside watching what was going on inside - and sometimes even look through the windows, the court was told. Louise Blackwell QC, prosecuting, said on the day of the killing Taylor texted Miss Emery to say: ‘I miss you. Maybe in time you’ll want to try again’. Trial: Armed with a knife Jason Taylor (left), 21, began grappling with Adam Wilson (right), 25, the court heard . She asked him not to contact her, but later that evening he sent her another text saying: ‘Can I come for cuddles?’ Miss Emery responded: ‘you being weird then’ but he said: ‘I’m not, my head is just f*****’ and he allegedly rang his mother asking for a knife he bought during a previous holiday with Miss Emery. The court heard he was spotted cycling towards her home during which he sent her another text asking her who she was with. She was said to have texted back: ‘On my own - I keep telling you’. But Taylor then allegedly said: ‘Last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there, last chance’. Emery replied ‘WTF’, and tried to call him three times with no response. Miss Blackwell added: ‘The defendant then arrived at the front door and used considerable force to kick his way through the bottom panel. Once inside the incident starts immediately in the hall between the defendant and Adam Wilson and spilled into the lounge. ‘Miss Emery was trying her best, obviously unsuccessfully to break apart and stop the defendant being able to get at Adam Wilson but it did not stop. Ex-girlfriend: Two days before the killing Taylor was at a local pub where he allegedly became convinced Miss Emery (pictured above in Facebook photographs) was seeing someone else . ‘All three of them ended up on the sofa in the living room. Adam Wilson was on the bottom, Jodie had got herself between him and the defendant lay on top but she described the repeated blows being struck to Adam Wilson. ‘She did not initially realise there was a knife involved but after a period of time during which blows were being rained down, the defendant then stood up. 'At that stage she saw he was armed with that knife, a knife she had seen before which he has bought when they were on holiday in Scarborough.’ Taylor allegedly fled the scene and dumped the knife as Miss Emery rang for ambulance. Mr Wilson was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from the 6cm (2.3in) long and 7.5cm (3in)-deep fatal wound which was to the inner right thigh. There were also cut wounds to the back, buttocks and legs and abrasions that were consistent with a struggle, the court heard. When Taylor was arrested he allegedly said: ‘No, you are not serious are you? You are joking, he is dead? He attacked me - I have done nothing wrong’. 'Fed up': Miss Emery (right) said Taylor (left) would turn up at her home and she believed he would carry on turning up if she did not reply to his messages . The black-handled blood stained knife was later recovered and Taylor said he kept it for ‘his own protection’ because he had been threatened in the past. He was said to have told police he had gone to speak to Miss Emery because of the breakdown of the relationship and had ‘no idea’ that Mr Wilson was there. He claimed he was hit with a bottle and used the knife to defend himself. In a video interview Miss Emery said Mr Wilson was ‘just a friend’ whom she had known for a couple of months. She said Taylor would turn up at her home and she believed he would carry on turning up if she did not reply to his messages. She claimed she was so fed up with her ex-boyfriend she invited Mr Wilson around to her home for a drinks and watch TV. She added: ‘Jason had been constantly texting all the time. I made sure I was answering and replying to the phone calls. I didn’t tell him that I was with anyone because I knew he would not like that. Floral tributes: Miss Emery - whose two young daughters were asleep upstairs in  Preston (above) – allegedly tried to stand between the pair in a bid to split them up, but Mr Wilson was left with a fatal thigh wound . ‘I said “I wasn’t with anyone, I wasn’t drinking - I was going to bed”. He was saying “are you with someone” - things along those lines. I was on the phone saying you are being weird with me I know you are drunk he said “tell me who you are with”. She looked out of her front window and ‘got a feeling’ he might be watching and heard the door being kicked in, the court was told. She said: ‘The bottom had caved in and he climbed through the hole. I’m not sure who threw the first punch but I have tried splitting them up. ‘I was shouting “my kids are upstairs. please stop”. At that point, Adam said “he stabbed me - ring 999”. I remember Jason swing the knife lower than the stab wound and that’s when I have seen the knife. ‘He was still stood with the knife in his hand. I said “the police are coming”, he said “you have grassed” and ran into the back garden.’ Taylor denies murder. The trial continues.

"We’ve all got photographs that bring back happy memories and for those that are cringeworthy or upsetting, there’s always the detag or delete button, or the bin. However, one US artist is asking members of the public to send him images they just can’t live with before they delete them or instead of binning them – with no explanation attached. It makes for an intriguing and harrowing display. Chicago-based Jason Lazarus, 39, began the project – an online archive called T.H.T.K, or Too Hard To Keep - in 2010 and now has over 150 photographs that include a huge range of scenes. With some, the reason for the owner wanting to purge it is easy to fathom. For instance, the collection contains photographs of a blood-soaked leg, a female with a black eye and a corpse. Others are more mysterious. One member of the public sent in a picture taken from a veranda of a man walking across a road and another submitted an image of a wooden pole on a beach. Mr Lazarus told MailOnline that the idea for the project began when he thought about why he kept photographs that held bad memories. He said: ‘I had the idea for the archive when reflecting on the charge or anxiety holding on to certain photographs brought me. I started asking friends and friends of friends if they had photographs too hard to keep, and the response was powerful - the project started to grow itself. ‘It often didn't need much explanation, people got it.’ The artist believes the absence of descriptions won’t matter to the archive’s visitors. He said: 'I respect viewers' abilities to openly engage the images in the context of their own lives and their life experiences.' Some of the images are very moving and Mr Lazarus, who has two of his own in the collection, has to suppress his emotions on occasions. He said: ‘Because it is my job to work on projects like these I compartmentalize for the sake of the larger growth of the project. Overall, the project continues to teach me and hopefully its audience, which significantly lessens any load.’ For him it’s the photographs of violence and empty landscapes that stand out. He said: ‘I can easily project myself into those narratives.’ Some photographs are just too harrowing for the senders to ever see again. As a result some images are displayed face down. So far, nothing has been sent in that's too disturbing to display, but Mr Lazarus, an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Chicago's School of the Art Institute, emphasizes that 'part of the project is to occasionally view harrowing images'. He explained that hopefully the repository will be updated indefinitely. He said: ‘I even have a fellow artist who will take over the project in case anything awful happens to me. I think it's important the trust imparted to me is reciprocated to the participants.’ Contributors to T.H.T.K come from all over the world, from a huge variety of cultures. Mr Lazarus said: ‘I’m hoping to reach anyone who feels the project gives them a sense of grace or greater meaning by participating.’ It certainly seems to be working, with the artist adding that reaction to the project has been 'strong'. The photographs have been put on public display in several cities around the world, including the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Future Gallery in Berlin, the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco and Gallery TPW in Toronto. Some respondents had photographs that were so upsetting for them that they didn't want them displayed ever again - so these appear face-down in the archive .

The search for Noah Thomas, from Dublin, has widened since he was first went missing when his mother decided to get another hour of sleep on Sunday morning. The four-foot, 60lb redheaded child's mother saw the boy at 9am but went back to bed and couldn't find him and saw that the living room door was open when she woke back up around 10am or 10.30am. Noah Thomas, 5, has been missing for two days after last being seen watching cartoons Sunday morning in Dublin, Virginia . Search crews have looked around the boy's house, where his mother saw him at 9am but could not find him after she woke up at 10 . A ground search continued overnight on Sunday and expanded to include more than 100 members of Virginia law enforcement near the boy's home in Pulaski County, according to WDBJ. The FBI and Virginia State Police have become involved in the search. Police and more than 100 volunteers who signed up to look for Noah in the small town have covered about 3.3 square miles. Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis said that authorities have no evidence of foul play in his disappearance. Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road near Noah's house, which is 'never typical'. No suspicious vehicles were seen in the area. The boy, who helped drop his mother and infant sibling drop his father off at work at 7am, is believed to be wearing a camouflage jacket, black and yellow paints and Spider-Man boots. He may also be wearing a San Diego Chargers jersey with the number 21 on it. Crews have used helicopters in the search in the area, which is mostly residential with farmland and a woods by the boy's house. Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis said that authorities and search have found no evidence of foul play in  disappearance . Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road near Noah's house, which is 'never typical'. The boy is believed to be wearing Spider-Man boots and a camouflage jacket when he disappeared . Police say that they are '80 per cent sure' that Noah did not fall into a nearby pond, according to WSLS. However, authorities are debating draining the body of water. His mother, who called police at 11am after searching for her child, said that the boy was a cautious child and had no history of running away. Noah's parents were scheduled to make a statement on Monday afternoon, but their statement was delayed. Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to contact the Pulaski Sheriff's Office at 540-980-7800 or the Virginia State Police 1-800-822-4453 . More than 100 people in the rural Virginia town signed up to search for the boy on Monday. They plan to continue searching for the boy round-the-clock. Billy Chrimes, deputy search and rescue coordinator with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, said that the best opportunity to find a missing child is often at night when they stop moving. Lack of food and water and potential problems with wildlife are also concerns, he told the Roanoke Times. Temperatures on Monday night were in the mid-40s. Amber Alerts are generally issued when there is a suspected kidnapper that authorities hope to catch. The area near the boys house includes a small woods and a pond that authorities are debating whether or not to drain .","Noah Thomas, 5, from Dublin, Virginia, was last seen Sunday around 9am .

"Stephen Hawking has made a heartfelt plea to stop fellow motor neurone sufferers dying without a voice. The world’s most famous scientist said losing the capacity to communicate is one of the most frightening challenges faced by people with motor neurone disease. Yet campaigners fear many funding gaps throughout Britain mean many sufferers fail to get the help they deserve. Some have been waiting months, when they rely on loved ones to interpret their needs, but others die first. Physicist Hawking, whose inspiring story is the subject of the Oscar-winning biopic The Theory of Everything starring Eddie Redmayne, lost the ability to speak in 1985. Stephen Hawking said not being able to communicate is 'one of the most frightening and isolating aspects of living with motor neurone disease'. He has made a plea to ensure other sufferers do not die without a voice . He now talks through a speech synthesiser with a distinctive electronic voice recognised globally. He said ‘I am a Patron of the Motor Neurone Disease Association. ‘Their campaign ""Don’t Let Me Die Without A Voice"" highlights how not being able to communicate is one of the most frightening and isolating aspects of living with motor neurone disease (MND). ‘Everyone with MND should be able to access speech and language therapy and the range of communication equipment technology which is out there. No one should die without a voice.’ Figures show at least two out of five MND patients wait more than six weeks to get the communication equipment they need, which can range from simple alphabet charts and speech therapy to high-tech support such as text-to-speech devices, eye gaze systems and voice-banking. Between 80-95 per cent of people living with MND experience some loss of speech before they die. The weakening of muscles in lip and tongue, vocal chords and chest contribute to deterioration in the ability to speak and swallow. Up to 5,000 people are living with MND at any time but 30 per cent die within a year of diagnosis, and over 50 per cent within two years. The scientist, whose inspiring story is the subject of the Oscar-winning biopic The Theory of Everything for which Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar, lost the ability to speak in 1985 . The rapidly progressive nature of the disease can result in patients dying even while waiting for the initial assessment of their needs. Currently the NHS funds communication aids for fewer than half the people with MND who need them, according to an investigation by MPs from the All Party Parliamentary Group on MND. As part of the 2012 NHS reforms, the Coalition Government identified that NHS England had a duty to provide communications support and equipment for people living with MND. However, the change to specialised commissioning in 2013 which should result in high- quality services across the country has resulted in catastrophic failure for people with MND, said Karen Pearce from the MND Association. She said: ‘People with motor neurone disease are having grave problems accessing the funding that is meant to be available for communication support in England. ‘Despite pockets of excellence, people with MND and health professionals tell us that speech and language therapy support services are also poor in too many areas, for example, in Surrey, Sussex, Birmingham, Worcestershire and West Yorkshire.’ ‘We know that in some cases people have waited months to access communications support and died without a voice’ added Chris James, of the MND Association. Building manager Liam Dwyer, 51, who was diagnosed with MND in 2005, has been waiting since last July for a speech and language therapy assessment. The father of a 21-year-old son, he lives in Surrey with wife Anna, who enables him to tell the world of his plight. He said: ‘It is hard enough being trapped in a failing body but not being able to communicate is one of the most frightening and isolating aspects of this disease. ‘Everyone with MND should be able to access speech and language therapy and the range of communication equipment technology which is out there. No one should die without a voice.’ A delegation of experts is to meet Liberal Democrat health minister Norman Lamb tomorrow asking him to take action over delays for people with MND in accessing communications support and equipment.","Physicist Hawking, who sufferers the disease, lost ability to speak in 1985 .

"Damning emails sent from a socialite to a trusted friend have revealed that she was 'terrified' of her teenage daughter in the months before she was murdered. Sheila von Weise Mack wrote to longtime confidante Elliott Jacobson on numerous occasions between 2013-14 about the violent episodes of her daughter, Heather Mack, 19, who is currently on trial for her mother's murder in Bali, Indonesia. In one email, shared with The Chicago Tribune, the 62-year-old wrote: 'Heather was violent again... Smashed several items in my home, threw things at me and left... Heather is in grave danger - and so am I.' Scroll down for video . Heather Mack and her mother, Sheila von Weise Mack, pictured in an undated vacation photo. The mother emailed a close confidante to share her worries about her daughter's violent temper in the months before she was murdered . Accused murderer Heather Mack, 19, pictured in her hospital room at Sanglah Hospital in Denpasar, Indonesia on Wednesday after giving birth to a baby girl. The father is co-accused, Tommy Schaefer . Heather Mack faces life in prison - or even death by firing squad - if convicted of the premeditated murder of her mother last August. Her boyfriend, 21-year-old Tommy Schaefer, also has been charged with murder. Mrs von Wiese Mack's badly-beaten body was found in a blood-spattered suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the luxury St. Regis Hotel in Bali on August 12. She had been on vacation with her daughter and Schaefer at the time. They have told police that Mrs von Wiese Mack objected after finding out about her daughter’s pregnancy and during a fierce argument, Schaefer struck Heather’s mother with the metal handle of a fruit bowl while her daughter hid in the bathroom. However in her emails to Mr Jacobson, it appeared that Mrs von Wiese Mack was aware that her daughter was pregnant before they left on the Bali vacation. The teen had also stolen heard mother's credit cards at this time and unknown to her run up a $4,000 bill throwing a party at a Chicago hotel, Mrs von Wiese-Mack wrote in an email. 'She is really a master at manipulation and lying,' the mother wrote to a friend. 'She will stop at nothing to get at my money.' On Tuesday, Heather Mack gave birth to a baby girl via Caesarean at Sanglah Hospital in Denpasar. In exclusive pictures, obtained by Daily Mail Online, Mack was seen at the window of her hospital room a day after giving birth to her 6lb 1oz daughter, Stella Schaefer, the last name being that of the baby's father and her co-accused. The accused murderers have claimed in court that the unborn baby had been at the center of problems. However, emails provided by Mr Jacobson to The Chicago Tribune, revealed that Heather Mack had a long history of violent outbursts, stealing and manipulative behavior. In March 2014, Mrs von Wiese Mack wrote in a string of emails to her longtime friend about her teenage daughter's explosive rages. 'Her anger escalates at an alarming rate and she seems to have no control over it - very scary. At least she didn't hit me - her rage went to the window instead,' she wrote, according to The Tribune. In another email she wrote: 'Heather ran away again tonight. She will not answer her phone. She will not answer emails and she told me that she would kill me and then kill herself ... I feel so desperate.' In one chilling message to her friend, Mrs von Wiese Mack wrote: 'I am really scared of what she may do next.' Mr Jacobson, 72, who worked in politics, passed on the emails to the Tribune so that his friend's voice may be heard, he reportedly said. Earlier this week Mack had given birth in a Caesarean operation to her 6lb 1oz daughter, Stella Schaefer, the surname being after the father and her co-accused 21-year-old Tommy Schaefer . Heather Mack and Tommy Schaefer, from Chicago, Illinois, (pictured in court on March 12) are being tried separately by the Denpasar District Court. They could both face a firing squad if found guilty of her mother's brutal murder last August . Although Miss Mack was not considered a flight risk,  she remains under guard at all time, no matter what the circumstances, at the Sanglah Hospital with her baby beside her in a cot. Joining her in the hospital room were the child's grandmother, Tommy Schaefer's mother, and other relatives and friends who had flown from their homes in Chicago. And it is from his mother and relatives that Schaefer will have to rely for a first-hand description of his baby, for he has been refused the right to travel under guard from Kerobokan Prison to the hospital. Prison sources said he was 'pacing up and down with frustration' in his cell as he anxiously waits for the moment when he will first set eyes on his daughter. ‘He’s going crazy in there, wanting to see his daughter, but he’s been told he's a prisoner on a serious charge and there will be no hospital visits,’ a prison source said. Unless the prison grants him a special privilege to see the baby, he is unlikely to see her until - and if - Miss Mack takes the child with her to their next scheduled court appearance on March 24. There is every likelihood of the couple’s next court appearance - their cases are being held separately - being adjourned while she regains the strength to face the judges in the Denpasar District Court. Miss Mack earlier had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital wanted up front. But her U.S. attorney, Anthony Scifo, has told the Chicago Tribune that he was able to send money to Indonesia earlier in the week after working out a deal with Miss Mack’s uncle, who controls $1.56 million in a trust fund set up for her by her murdered mother. Miss Mack does not have access to the money before her 30th birthday. Miss Mack planned to keep the baby with her in the cell for the maximum allowed period of two years - unless there are dramatic developments in the case against her and she is able to leave the notorious prison. Sheila Von Wiese-Mack's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel . It was not known when she will be returned to the prison with her baby, but hospital staff suggested it could be within the next 48 hours. Mack had earlier told friends who have been supporting her during jail visits that she was expecting her baby in April. This means the child was born prematurely. Last week,  Schaefer told the trial that he had been attacked by Wiese-Mack and called a racially offensive slur. He said that his relationship with Heather was not endorsed by her mother and he went to Bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant. After meeting with Mack at the hotel, they discussed how to inform Mrs von Wiese-Mack that Mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where Mack and her mother were staying. Speaking through an interpreter, Schaefer said Mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl, which he hid under his shirt as a 'precaution'. Asked by a judge why it was hidden, Schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself. According to Schaefer, he arrived in the room and found Miss Mack weeping. He did not know why, but also saw her mother was screaming. 'She (von Wiese-Mack) was angry at me when she knew that Heather was pregnant,' Schaefer said, while trying to hold back tears. Heavily pregnant Mack (pictured right a week before the birth) and boyfriend Tommy Schaefer (second from left), 21, sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of her mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack . Miss Mack, who was sitting beside her lawyer, sobbed at the testimony. He said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man. He said the situation got heated when Mrs von Wiese-Mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby. Schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which Mr von Wiese-Mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds. 'I was angry, I took the fruit bowl and hit her,' Schaefer said, in tears. He added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim. After acknowledging she wasn't breathing, he tried to give her artificial respiration, while Mack, who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes, came back and tried to revive her mother. He said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the United States. In her first questioning in court last Wednesday, Mack, who is eight months' pregnant, said Schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von Wiese-Mack made the threat in an argument. 'The blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting,' Miss Mack said. 'I asked Tommy to stop and then I ran into the bathroom.' The 62-year-old's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets. In January, Mack had said she vowed to bring the baby up in the cramped Bali prison she shares with six others. She has told fellow prisoners in the Wijaya Kusuma cell block of her intentions - but that has not gone down well with several of the other women. 'Make arrangements to get your baby out of here,' one prisoner was reported to have angrily told her. 'We're fed up with being woken by crying babies.' In an adjoining cell a prisoner in her late 30s was raising a baby which cries through the night, waking other inmates. 'This is what your baby is going to be doing - waking us up - and we don't want that,' Heather was told by one woman - according to visitors leaving the prison after delivering food to relatives in the women's section of the notorious prison. The protests, however, have failed to dampen the resolve of Mack.","Sheila von Weise Mack wrote to a longtime confidante about the violent episodes of her daughter, Heather Mack, 19 .

"'Ladies' man' Naushad Faruk but has been jailed for three-and-a-half years for voyeurism and perverting the course of justice . A PR cameraman who lured glamour models into making secret 'sex tapes' by pretending he worked for a lads' mag has been jailed for three-and-half years. Naushad Faruk, also known as Jonny Na$h, sent a revenge porn-style clip to one of the women after convincing her to strip for a fake spread in men's magazine Loaded. The 33-year-old, who featured in BBC Three reality show Boom Town as a self-styled 'ladies' man,' taped women performing sex acts on him with a secret camera hidden in his watch. On his Twitter page, poser Faruk has posted pictures of himself attending the film premieres of Sylvester Stallone action flick 'The Expendables 3' and 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit', starring Chris Pine. After his first court appearance, Faruk tweeted two of the victims' real names and working names and linked them to a national newspaper article, thus breaching their legal right to anonymity. He also called the workplace of a prostitute he secretly filmed and pretended to be a national newspaper reporter, making numerous threats including exposing the case in the media and creating a 'media storm.' During his trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, Faruk, of Goldfinch Crescent, Bracknell, Berkshire, was removed from court seven times for being disruptive and heckling the main victim and other witnesses. Faruk, who described himself as 'the master of seduction' on his BBC Three show, was convicted of three counts of voyeurism and two charges of perverting the course of justice. As well as being jailed, he was slapped with a 12-year restraining order preventing him from going near the victims. During his trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, Faruk was removed from the courtroom seven times for being disruptive and heckling the main victim and other witnesses . Detective Constable Rob Jones said: 'This case shows that if someone threatens to release 'revenge porn' into the public domain they will be dealt with robustly, not only by the police but also by the courts, as is demonstrated by this sentence. 'The women involved have been extremely traumatised and felt extreme fear throughout, especially the sex worker who was ""petrified"" when Faruk called her place of work. 'Because of this she wanted to withdraw from the trial but I was able to reassure her that we would look after her, as we do with all vulnerable victims and witnesses.' After secretly filming the Camden-based glamour model engaging in sexual activity with him, Faruk sent her a message on social media in March 2014 with the video edited to music showing her professional name on the screen. The message ended with 'TBC' and a threat saying: 'What happens next is up to you.' The woman reported the message to police and, after an investigation, arrested Faruk. When detectives scoured Faruk's digital media they found other 'sex tapes' and were able to identify two other women, a model and a sex worker. Both videos were secretly filmed using a camera watch, one at a photo shoot and another when Faruk visited the prostitute's workplace. He was charged with three counts of voyeurism in July 2014 but following his preliminary hearing on September 2, Faruk identified the two main victims over Twitter. It was after this that he called the sex worker's workplace and, as well as threatening staff, said he would visit the premises with a warrant and take a statement from the victim and her photo for the newspaper. Faruk, pictured outside an earlier hearing at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court threatened one of the victims with exposure in the national press . Faruk was re-arrested on September 5 for breaching his bail conditions and was later charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice. Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Packer said: 'The filming of women engaging in sexual acts is extremely disturbing when you consider that they had no idea they were being secretly filmed without their knowledge or consent. 'Extreme care and consideration has been shown to all the victims in this case and each one has been provided the most professional and dedicated service by DC Jones. 'They have been supported all the way through the matter right up to providing evidence in court.' In a description about his appearance in Boom Town, Faruk called himself a 'larger-than-life personality, with a 'particular interest in the ladies'. The profile said: 'I spent my formative years growing up in the Big Apple, where I learned my range of seduction skills on the streets of New York before returning home to the UK. 'I have spent many years working in my father's restaurants, but have recently realised that the catering industry is not for me. I need a more glamorous, lady-orientated lifestyle. 'In Boom Town, you can see me doing everything in my power to get closer to the ladies, from speed dating to becoming a male escort, trying my pick up techniques in the gym to hosting my own 'Love God' seminar for single men who want to learn how to attract the ladies from the master of seduction himself (me).' For the three counts of voyeurism Faruk was jailed for a total of 30 months, with an 18 month and a 12 month sentence to be served consecutively and a four month term to be served concurrently. For the two counts of perverting the course of justice he was sentenced to terms of 12 months and six months to be served concurrently. This has left Faruk with a total sentence of 42 months, or three-and-a-half years. In addition to the restraining order, he was issued with requirements under the Sexual Offenders Act and ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge.","Naushad Faruk, 33, also known as Jonny Na$h, is self-styled 'ladies' man'

Irving Diaz, who was pictured in June embracing a woman and grabbing her rear, has received another complaint against him after a female in 'short shorts' was spotted behind the wheel of his authorized vehicle . It is not clear whether it is the same woman involved in each incident. Guzman-Phillips was described as being 'scantily-clad' and wearing short shorts at the time, the Florida Times Union reported. The manager at the restaurant said she didn't work there. According to an internal affairs report, he explained his choices were just a 'bad mistake' The investigation also revealed that Diaz had checked the woman's name in a database to check if she had any outstanding warrants to her name. Just two days before Guzman-Phillips is said to have driven the car again. The husband of Diaz's ex-wife, Jonathan Potter, was dropping Diaz's children off for a scheduled visit when he saw the 24-year-old get out of his vehicle and run into the house, again wearing 'short shorts'. Diaz admitted to investigators that he allowed Guzman-Phillips to drive his patrol car twice in October. According to the report is explanation was that he had made a 'bad decision'. The internal affairs department handed him two counts of improper action and one count each of unbecoming conduct,. The counts added to repeated infractions of unbecoming conduct, in relation to the photograph taken earlier last year, and improper use of computer software. 'The investigation and discipline speak for itself,” Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Melissa Bujeda told the paper. 'There will be no other statement in reference to this incident.'

"A young female doctor has bravely penned a blog post exposing the daily sexism she faces within the medical industry and admits she's scared she will now lose her job for going public. Melbourne doctor Ashleigh Witt  revealed in the online post the varying degrees of sexual harassment she and other women have experienced following a Sydney surgeon's controversial comments last week. Vascular surgeon Dr Gabrielle McMullin suggested young women in the field should 'just accept unwanted sexual advances' because sexism was so rife among doctors. She was referring to a woman named Caroline who won a case against a doctor accused of sexually assaulting her, but was then unable to get work at any public hospital. Melbourne doctor Ashley Witt has bravely penned a blog post exposing the daily sexism she faces within the medical indudstry . Dr Witt admits she is concerned her career could be jeopardised by  her decision to speak out about sexism . 'Her career was ruined by this one guy asking for sex on this night. And, realistically, she would have been much better to have given him a blow job on that night,' Dr McMullin told ABC radio on Friday. Dr Witt said in her blog post the Sydney surgeon wasn't the problem. 'She is simply the messenger. The problem here is a system where reporting sexual harassment is vehemently discouraged,' she wrote. The Melbourne-based trainee doctor, who describes herself as a moderately pretty blonde, said medicine's secret catchphrase was: 'Keep your mouth shut and you'll be fine.' 'We all have stories about sexual harassment at work - some of them subtle, some of them shocking. And yet person after person (mostly men, although I can't imagine why), have stood up and said sexual harassment is not a problem in medicine. Vascular surgeon Dr Gabrielle McMullin has suggested young women in the field should 'just accept unwanted sexual advances' because sexism was so rife among doctors . The Melbourne-based trainee doctor, who describes herself as a moderately pretty blonde, said medicine's secret catchphrase was: 'Keep your mouth shut and you'll be fine' 'Perhaps we aren't understanding what sexual harassment is. Perhaps we're associating it with only the extreme example of rape, when it encompasses so much more than unwanted physical touching,' Dr Witt said. She then went on to list the varying degrees of sexism she has faced. 'Sexual harassment is every time you call me 'blondie' or 'barbie', every time you make a joke about my choice to wear a skirt not pants, every time you comment on my appearance rather than my skillset, every time you call me a 'lady doctor' instead of a 'doctor'. 'Sexual harassment is two weeks ago when I lead a code blue which saved a woman on the labour ward and my male colleague arrived after the fact and said 'they shouldn't send you up here, you're too clucky'. 'It's the consultant who commented that I'd 'obviously gotten to where I was at a young age because I was pretty'. 'It's the surgical registrar who told me if I wanted to be taken seriously I needed to dye my hair dark.' Ms Wit wrote in her blog that a surgical registrar told her if she  wanted to be taken seriously  she should dye her hair dark .","Ashleigh Witt wrote a blog exposing daily sexism in medical industry .

"It may look like a stunning rainbow of colour, but the psychedelic hue of this hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, is a result of years of unintended vandalism by visitors. Once a brilliant shade of blue, the Morning Glory pool's appearance has altered dramatically since the 1950s, thanks to an accumulation of coins, rubbish and natural debris. The pool has been dubbed the Fading Glory, due to the transformation from its original colour to the yellowy-green hue it has today. Scroll down for video . Morning Glory in the Yellowstone National Park was once a brilliant shade of blue, but now owes its yellow tinge to debris and coins thrown in over the years . The Morning Glory hot spring in 1940. The photograph reveals a stark contrast to the fiery colours now exhibited at the tourist attraction . The popular tourist attraction sees three million visitors flock to gaze at its psychedelic waters in Wyoming, USA. The site first gained popularity in the 1940s when a million tourists would visit the site . Pool on fire! The fierce colours are influenced by how light interacts with the water’s depth, with yellow and orange colours in the shallows and green in the deep waters . The rainbow hot spring has been clogged up with debris, which block the heat vents, and affecting the water circulation in the pool . It is estimated that the destruction of the hot spring has been building up for decades. Research by Montana State University and Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany helped to create a model that could depict the hot spring's colours from over a century ago, when it was less frequented by visitors. Now nearly three million tourists flock to Yellowstone National Park, compared to the one million in the 1940s, which has led to the build-up of debris in the pool. As the underwater vents started to get clogged up, water circulation was affected, decreasing the temperature of the waters and causing a migration of the orange-coloured bacteria towards the centre. Adam Hoffman from Science Friday said: 'Pigments produced by swaths of those microbes—called microbial mats—are responsible, at least in part, for the brilliant yellows, greens, and oranges that now tinge Morning Glory and other thermal pools in Yellowstone.' Photographs from 1966 show the Upper Geyser Basin  pool's original blue colour, before the build up of coins and rubbish . The pool received its name in 1883 from Mrs McGowan, who was the wife of Assistant Park Superintendent, Charles McGowan. As a nod to its then crystal blue colour, she named it after the blue flower, Morning Glory. Although it was originally known by its Latin name, Convolutus, by 1889 it was commonly known by its current name. Over three million people enjoy the Yellowstone National Park annually, spans an area of 3,468.4 square miles, comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and mountain ranges . Unless some subterranean shift happens where more hot water can again flow to the surface, Morning Glory will never be fully blue again . Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone National Park , fueled by Yellowstone Caldera, the largest supervolcano on the continent . The pool has warning signs around it, in an attempt to reduce further vandalism to its waters, (left). It has been dubbed Fading Glory, now bearing little resemblance to the bright blue flowers which gave it its name, (right)","Morning Glory in Yellowstone National Park has drastically changed from crystal blue to a yellowy-green hue .

"A one-year-old baby died after being crushed by bricks outside his family home when his father reversed his pick-up truck into a wall. Amaan Yaseen suffered serious head injuries after heavy bricks crumbled down on top of him as he played outside the semi-detached home in Stetchford, Birmingham, yesterday afternoon. Witnesses said they saw the 19-month old lying in a pool of blood on the pavement after the crash and his distraught father stood over him 'crying his eyes out'. Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Amaan was pronounced dead at the scene. Today, the family paid tribute to their 'lovely little boy' and said it was 'obviously a very difficult time'. Speaking on their behalf, family friend Mohammed Hafeez said: 'His father was driving the vehicle. This was an accidental and tragic death.' Floral tributes have been left at the scene of the incident in Birmingham where one-year-old Amaan Yaseen died after a pick-up truck - driven by his father - reversed into a wall which then collapsed on him . Amaan suffered a serious head injury and died outside a semi-detached home in Stetchford, Birmingham. The pick-up truck (pictured) reversed into the family's wall which caused it to collapse on top of the youngster . Addressing the media, family friend Mohammad Hafeez (pictured) read a statement out on behalf of the family outside the home today. He said: 'His parents are devastated and shocked. Amaan was a lovely little boy' Floral tributes and teddy bears have been placed outside the family's home in the quiet residential suburb, which has been left stunned by the tragedy. Speaking from outside the property today, Mr Hafeez read out a statement on behalf of the family which paid tribute to Amaan. He said: 'At about 5pm last night, the Yaseen family suffered a tragic loss. 'A member of the family was parking a heavy goods vehicle when it collided with a wall and bricks fell onto Amaan Yaseen, who was only 19-months-old. 'Despite efforts to resuscitate him by paramedics, Amaan died at the scene. 'His parents are devastated and shocked. Amaan was a lovely little boy who brought a lot of joy and happiness to his entire family, especially his parents. 'He will be deeply missed. 'Amaan's family would like to thank West Midlands Ambulance service and West Midlands Police. 'It is very traumatic for Amaan's parents to have to go through. 'His father was driving the vehicle at the time. He is obviously and understandably very distraught and upset about it. 'This is obviously a very difficult time for the family. This was an accidental and tragic death.' Roy Ives, 70, from Kitts Green, Birmingham, was walking home at about 4.50pm when he saw the incident. The carer described it as a 'scene of devastation'. He said: 'It was horrendous. There was two big plots of bricks, one was 12ft high and a smaller one. 'I must have missed it by seconds. 'The driver had started to back up and hit the bricks because you could see the lorry was blocking the slip-road to the driveway. It was facing down the hill, so it must have reversed. Amaan suffered serious head injuries after heavy bricks crumbled down on top of him as he played outside his family's semi-detached home in Stetchford, Birmingham (pictured), at about 5pm yesterday afternoon . Witnesses said they saw the youngster lying in a pool of blood on the pavement after the crash and his distraught father 'crying his eyes out'. Pictured: Neighbours leave floral tributes at the scene of the crash . One young girl and her mother leave a bunch of flowers at the scene, where the crumbled wall remains today . 'I was only there for about 12 seconds. A helicopter landed on the park and ambulances came. 'But I could see he was gone. 'There was a pool of blood but not immediately beside his head so he must have been moved. 'He had his hands on his chest but I knew he had gone. 'I didn't see it happen but the scene afterwards was awful. It was a scene of devastation. The poor baby was lying on the pavement. 'There were a lot of people around but I don't know who was the dad or mum. 'The driver looked to be Asian and in his 30s. I don't know if it was his father or not. 'It made me feel sick. I haven't eaten since. It has disturbed me that much. It is sad and very tragic.' Amaan's parents have not yet been named but residents said the father was a taxi-driver who also owned a truck pick-up firm. The couple are said to have lived at the £120,000 semi-detached property for about 10 years and have four children together. Their next door neighbour Mary Mason, 67, added: 'The pick-up truck is there quite often so I think it belongs to the dad. 'I saw it reversing out my window and then it lurched forward and I heard a massive crash. I looked out and their garden wall had collapsed. 'Next thing I know I can just hear screaming and shouting, I don't know what was going on. There was chaos. I could just hear yelling and panicked screams. 'There were blue flashing lights everywhere but I had no idea what had happened, I thought the wall had just collapsed but the shouting and the noise made me think it could have been something worse.' Another neighbour Glenys Cooper, 68, said: 'I went out after hearing a lot of commotion. There were sirens blaring. 'I spoke to one woman who was in a right state, she was really upset and she said it was her cousin who had been involved. 'But she couldn't get to anywhere near the scene really, the police soon had it all taped off. It's such a tragedy. 'I'm a grandmother and when you think it could have been one of your grandkids, you just can't imagine what the parents must be feeling.' Family friend Mohammad Hafeez (pictured) said: 'His father was driving the vehicle at the time. He is obviously and understandably very distraught and upset about it. This is obviously a very difficult time' A woman leaves some flowers outside the family home in the Stetchford area of Birmingham after the tragedy . Several neighbours said they thought the owner of the truck was the boy's father, a taxi driver, who was seen 'crying his eyes out' after the crash. Dozens of flowers were left at the scene outside the property today . A white forensic tent was erected outside the £120,000 semi-detached property where the crash took place . Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, added: 'The dad was driving his van, it's there all the time and he obviously didn't see his son who must have been on the footpath. 'They have a pick-up truck and a taxi, he has a few jobs - he is a hardworking and decent man. 'He is always reversing it on and off the drive and tragically he has hit the wall which collapsed on his lad who was the other side. 'They have lived there about 10 years and have about four children. They are good people. They will be heartbroken. 'I looked out my window and could see the man crying his eyes out - he was a mess, he was really in a bad way.' Grandmother-to-two Tracy Wilson, 50, added: 'I am really shocked. 'I won't drive past that part of the street for some time now. It has shocked me that much. I will drive the other way down the street just to avoid it. 'It is just horrid. I am a grandmother myself. It must be awful for the family. It is very very sad. I just feel sick. 'The family must be absolutely devastated. 'It is a close-knit community. There is a great feeling of sadness on this street.' Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'A truck hit a wall, which fell and squashed a baby. 'I am so shocked that the baby has died. It crushed the poor kid. It is just absolutely heart wrenching.' Paramedics and an emergency doctor made desperate efforts to save Amaan and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance attended the scene (pictured). However, despite the attempts, the boy was pronounced dead . Officers were called to a residential road in the Stechford area of Birmingham (pictured) yesterday afternoon . Barbara Porter, 76, added: 'I heard the helicopter land in Old Yardley Park over the road and there was police and ambulances everywhere. 'It's a really busy road and we've had loads of accidents down here. To know it is a little child is just heart-breaking. 'There's a lot of pedestrians as we are by a school and the cars are always bombing down the road. It's such a shame. 'It doesn't get more tragic than this. It's upsetting to think about what his family must be going through right now.' West Midlands Police confirmed that Amaan's father was the driver of the truck and  said he is being supported by specially trained police officers. Inspector Paul Bennett said: 'This is a very tragic set of circumstances – words cannot describe what his family are going through and our thoughts are with them at this time. 'Specialist officers will be supporting the boy's family and – as with all serious and fatal collisions - an investigation has been launched to establish the cause.' A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service added: 'A rapid response vehicle was on scene within four minutes of the call and was backed up by an ambulance, a paramedic officer, a BASICS Emergency Doctor and the Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance. 'The boy suffered a serious head injury. 'Ambulance staff carried out advanced life support but sadly nothing could be done to save him and he was confirmed dead at the scene by the doctor.' Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the crash to come forward. Anyone with information about what happened should call police on 101 and ask for the Collision Investigation Unit quoting log 1637 16/3/2015.","Amaan Yaseen, aged one, died after being crushed under stack of bricks .

"The United States has evacuated its remaining 100 Special Operations forces members from Yemen. This due to the country's deteriorating security situation, as was witnessed on Friday when four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 and injured hundreds more when they walked into the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in the capital city of Sanaa and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country. A fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques. ISIS has since taken responsibility for the attack, but it is still not confirmed if they were in fact behind the bombings. What's more, hundreds of members of al Qaeda managed to escape from Yemeni prisons on Thursday and Friday. In addition, the Houthis issued a call to arms on Saturday to fight those loyal to the embattled President Hadi. Scroll down for videos . Yemenis and members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene of a suicide attack on Saturday in Yemen . Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi delivers a speech calling for unity on Saturday . CNN reports that Navy SEALs and members of the Army's Delta Force are among those who were at the Al Anad airbase in Yemen and are now being sent out of the country. The United States had already closed its embassy in Sanaa last month. This after years spent working with Yemen in a quest to topple the terrorist organization al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. AQAP, which is based in the country, claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shooting earlier this year in Paris. Members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene inside the mosque of one of Friday's suicide bombings . Further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. The Houthis are a Shia group that has only recently gained power in the country after taking over the government in a coup-d'etat that some believe was funded by Iran. In January of this year, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace, and by February they had taken control of the government. It was at this point most Americans were withdrawn from the country and the embassy was shuttered. The Houthis also launched a strike against President Hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of Aden, the country's temporary capital. That same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of President Hadi and Houthi rebels battled in the same city. Then on Saturday, the Houthis issued a call to arms to attack supporters of President Hadi. This after President Hadi called the Houthis overtaking of the government 'a coup against constitutional legitimacy' in one of his first speeches in weeks. He also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the Saudi city of Riyadh, and no doubt upset the Houthis when he also announced his plan to place a national flag in the city of Sa'dah, the Houthi base. Above all else he said he wanted unity for the country. Hundreds of Yemenis chant slogans and hold placards as they protest the suicide bombings . Meanwhile, should ISIS indeed be behind Friday's attack, that would make the situation even more dire as though they and al Qaeda are both extremist Sunni groups, the two have spoken out against one another in the past with al Qaeda finding many ISIS acts and attacks far too extreme. Making ISIS's role in the bombings more likely is the January decree of al Qaeda senior leader Harith an-Nadhari who spoke against the shedding of 'unlawful blood,' such as attacks in mosques. The United States has said however they still cannot confirm who is behind the attacks.","The United States has evacuated its remaining 100 Special Operations forces members from Yemen .

"Premera Blue Cross, a health insurer based in the Pacific Northwest, said Tuesday that it was the victim of a cyberattack that could affect 11 million people. The company said hackers gained access to its systems on May 5 and that it did not discover the breach until Jan. 29. The breach could have exposed members' names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, mailing and email addresses, phone numbers, member ID numbers and bank account information, the Mountlake Terrace, Washington, company said. Hacked: Premera Blue Cross said Tuesday its computer network had been hacked, potentially exposing data from 11 million people, in the second recent such attack on a major US health insurer . The information dates as far back as 2002 and affects users of Premera Blue Cross, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, and Vivacity and Connection Insurance Solutions. Claims information, including clinical information as well as the personal information of people who did business with Premera, could also have been exposed. Premera said it has not found evidence that data was removed from its systems or that customer information has been used inappropriately. Premera said it was working with the FBI and the private security firm Mandiant 'to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the incident and to remove the infection created by the attack.' 'The security of Premera's members' personal information remains a top priority. We at Premera take this issue seriously and sincerely regret the concern it may cause,' said Premera chief executive Jeff Roe. Breach: The company admitted the breach could have exposed members' names, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses and more . 'As much as possible, we want to make this event our burden, not that of the affected individuals, by making services available today to help protect people's information.' It will provide two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to consumers affected by the breach. Premera currently has about 1.8 million members. It provides health, life, vision, dental, disability and other types of insurance. In February, Anthem, the second-largest health insurer in the U.S., disclosed a breach that affected about 80 million customers. Cybersecurity experts say that attack was a sign that hackers are shifting their focus away from retailers and looking at targets in health care and other fields because their systems may be more easily breached. Companies ranging from retailers Target and Home Depot to Sony Pictures Entertainment have disclosed expensive and embarrassing data breaches recently. Last year, US retailer Home Depot said 53 million email addresses were stolen, months after fellow retailer Target said the personal data of 70 million customers was accessed. Analysts are now suggesting hackers could be moving away from retailers to companies like insurers, where sensitive data goes beyond the financial .","Premera Blue Cross, an insurer based in the Pacific Northwest, revealed the breach Tuesday .

"HACK ATTACK: State Department computers were compromised by intruders thought to be working from inside Russia . The U.S. State Department, already beset with allegations that it hasn't kept a tight enough leash on its officials' email accounts, shut down some of its unclassified email servers on Friday in order to clear out what sources say was a rash of malware inserted by foreign hackers. Cybersecurity officials at State believe Russian hackers are to blame but described the breach of their networks only as 'activity of concern.' The State Department did its best to handle the problem quietly, making no announcement during the regular daily reporters' briefing on Friday and issuing a subdued statement 21 minutes before the end of the work day. ABC News reported that the cyber intrusion is one of the most serious in the agency's history. But State framed it as a 'planned outage' and a routine 'upgrade' to its digital security systems, blocking its employees from sending outside emails and shuttering their Web browsers for an unspecified stretch of time that could last for days. 'As a part of the Department of State's ongoing effort to ensure the integrity of our unclassified networks against cyber attacks,' spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement, 'the Department is implementing improvements to the security of its main unclassified network during a short, planned outage of some internet-linked systems.' 'The Department continues to closely monitor and respond to activity of concern on our unclassified network. Such activity is something we take very seriously.' NOTHING TO SEE HERE -- MOVE ALONG ... State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki downplayed the damage, saying that a 'planned outage' was in the works . MALWARE: Hackers inserted malicious code into nonclassified computers at the State Department, leaving tech experts no choice but to shut everything down and clean it up . 'There has been no compromise of any of the Department's classified systems, nor of our core financial, consular, and human resource systems,' Psaki claimed. 'The recent increase in news reports regarding cyber incidents reflects that the Department is among a growing list of public institutions and private industries facing an increasing number of sophisticated cyber threats.' This isn't the first such outage to hit America's diplomatic nerve center: The same kind of event happened once in November when the State Department carried out what it called an 'upgrade' following an October cyber attack. Two State Department employees told Daily Mail Online that they couldn't reach websites from their office computers during the dinner hour on Friday, and confirmed that no emails were going in or out other than interdepartmental messages. Hackers have run roughshod over computer servers in the executive branch of the U.S. government in recent years, targeting the White House on a regular basis. In October, following an outage covering much of the Executive Office of the President, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters it should 'not be particularly surprising' that 'there are many people around the world who would love to gain greater insight into the activities of the United States government by collecting information from the White House network.' Many did find it surprising, however, to hear Earnest acknowledge that the computer infrastructure of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is 'subject to daily cyberattacks, or at least efforts to infiltrate it.' The FBI, the NSA and the Secret Service were all involved in an investigation, with insiders telling news organizations that – as with Friday's State Department trouble – Russian hackers were the most likely suspects. In August 2014 a cybersecurity firm discovered that Russian hackers had stolen 1.2 billion user names and passwords in a series of Internet heists affecting 420,000 websites. And a months-long sustained cyber attack on JP Morgan Chase last summer also originated in Russia, security officials believe, and may have also targeted as many as nine other banks. COULD IT BE? Russia's government is still angry at the Obama administration for imposing tough eceonimc sanctions on the nation's oligarchs following President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea . At least 83 million bank accounts were affected, mostly belonging to consumers but includnig about 7 million commercial customers as well. Hackers got access to customers' names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. Saparately, the FBI offered a $3 million reward last month for information leading to the capture of a Russian hacker believed to be behind the electronic theft of $100 million from American bank accounts. Evgeniy Bogachev is accused of deploying a 'botnet' – a hijacked super-network of personal computers controlled remotely without the owners' knowledge – by spreading malicious software through spam emails. The FBI described Bogachev's technique last year as 'an extremely sophisticated type of malware designed specifically to steal banking and other credentials from the computers it infects.'","Not the first time America's diplomatic nerve center has been compromised .

"A 73-year-old man who threatened from behind bars to forcibly take back the western Montana ranch he lost in a 1979 divorce has been sentenced to 75 years in prison for intimidating and stalking its owners. The sentence ends the long-running case against John Fesler Lance II, who was so defiant in his claim to the property that he spent nearly 30 years in prison for threats over its court-ordered sale and then confronted the owners as soon as he was free. John Fester Lance II threatened from behind bars to forcibly take back the western Montana ranch he lost in a 1979 divorce -- and has been sentenced to 75 years in prison for intimidating and stalking its owners . Lance told the judge Wednesday that if he were released, he would again try to take back the ranch. 'You effectively described why I could never put you on probation,' District Judge Jeffrey Langton said, 'and why I don't think you should ever be released from prison again.' Lance was convicted of felony intimidation, stalking, violating a protective order and trespassing . The defendant looked thin in his orange jumpsuit in court, saying he had been on a 10-day hunger strike and would fast without food or liquid until he dies. He went back to the state prison Wednesday. Lance spent 27 years behind bars after convictions beginning in the mid-1980s for intimidating judges, attorneys and others involved in the court-mandated sale of the ranch. In recent years, he sent letters to current owners Lee and Lucinda Hayne and their attorney that threatened to use all force necessary to take his ranch back, including kidnapping, the couple said. He was released from prison last March and showed up the next day at Lucinda Hayne's workplace. He spent April through July in jail for violating a court order of protection. Lance was arrested again after going to the ranch on Sept. 15 and arguing that the Haynes were trespassing and he had the right to use force to evict them. They held him at gunpoint until deputies arrived. Lance, who was acting as his own attorney, refused to participate in his February trial and was convicted of felony intimidation, stalking, violating a protective order and trespassing. Ravalli County Attorney Bill Fulbright sought a 75- to 100-year prison sentence, arguing that Lance 'refuses to follow the basic rules of society.' 'Given that, it's our belief that the only recourse we're left with is to put prison bars between this defendant and the community,' Fulbright said. The Haynes said it will be some time before they come off 'high alert'  and can feel safe on their property near Florence.

"A man has opened up about what happened when he discovered his identity had been stolen online and used to contact dozens of women. At first, Jon Will Chambers, a freelance creative designer from Norwich, didn't think much of it when a stranger e-mailed him to say she had been speaking to a man online who was using his pictures under a different name. But it soon became clear that the problem went way deeper than just the one instance. Scroll down for video . Jon Will Chambers, 22, has opened up about how an online impostor used his personal photos to talk to at least 20 girls and women over a period of five  years . In fact, Jon discovered that at least 20 women and teenage girls had been tricked into communicating with the man, who used the fake name 'David Jones,' (not name actually used on the sites) with a number of them led to believe they were in a romantic relationship with him. 'David' was using recent pictures from Jon's Facebook page as well as old ones from his deleted MySpace account in order to assume his identity and over a period of four to five years, he had sent thousands of emails using Jon's pictures. He contacted women through dating sites, social media platforms and teenage forums, using several different email addresses and charming them with poetry and his supposed love of music. Even after Jon confronted them, some of the women didn't understand that he and 'David' were not the same person. Speaking to MailOnline, Jon said: 'Some of the girls had been speaking to him for five years and thought they were in a relationship with ""me"". 'That's when things started to get creepy and strange but above all worrying as it was clear he was spending a lot of time talking to young girls using my identity.' He tried contacting the police, but to no avail - they told him there is no law preventing people from taking his online pictures, since he had them on a public setting . Eventually, one of the women hacked into 'David's' account and discovered his true identity - a 65-year-old married man from the UK living in Spain. After Jon tracked him down online, 'David' apologised, describing himself as 'just a sad lonely man' and claiming that he was mentally unwell. Still, Jon felt that justice needed to be served - not just for him, but for the dozens of girls and women 'David' had duped. So he tried contacting the police, but to no avail. He was sent to Action Fraud, which deals with internet crime, but they told him there was not much they could do about it. Their advice was to edit his privacy settings or take down his accounts altogether, but Jon didn't want to give  his impostor that satisfaction. He said: 'They told me to just make my profiles private - that's not a response, that's just sticking your head in the sand and pretending it won't happen to the next person. 'I'm not going to miss out on meeting new people, getting new business or being myself by not embracing social media or the 21st century.' Despite the incident, Jon has decided not to let it affect his online life. He said: 'I don't think you can live your life in fear of people doing bad things' Instead, he believes it's time law was updated in order to protect internet users from this kind of criminal behaviour. 'There was a clear and obvious pattern of grooming where he would take them from a public forum, to a private email, to speaking on Skype or on the phone,' he said. 'That's the most creepy thing and worrying behaviour about this - and the police still weren't interested despite all the evidence. 'I was worried that if this was just the tip of the iceberg - who was this man? What would he do if I told the police? 'Also, what would the family of these girls think of ""me"" despite the fact it wasn't me doing all this - it was someone using my face.' Jon has spent the last few months attempting to get all 15 of 'David's' fake social media profiles taken down, an arduous process that has yet to be completed. When Jon's imposter was finally tracked down, he was revealed to be a pensioner in Spain (Picture posed by model) One social media site told him that his impostor didn’t break their 'community usage policy', while another never replied to his emails. Despite the fact that some of the fake accounts are still up to this day, Jon has decided not to let it affect his online life.

"A congressman from The Last Frontier is drawing criticism for suggesting  gray wolves could help solve the homeless problem while addressing his colleagues at the Capitol. Alaska Rep. Don Young made the remark during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing yesterday. Young, 81, was responding to a letter 79 members of Congress sent to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell asking her to reconsider her agency's 2011 decision to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list. Scroll down for video . Alaska Congressman Don Young, 81, made his gray wolf remark yesterday while speaking at the Capitol . The gray wolf (above) was removed from the endangered species list in 2011. Some want it put back on the list . Alaska had 1,913 homeless resident in 2012 according to a Homelessness Research Institute report . Young, a Republican, supported the decision to delist gray wolves and does not want them to reacquire protected status. During Young's remarks to Jewell, he called the gray wolf a 'predator' that is 'killing the cloven-hoof animals', according to Alaska Public Radio. He said: 'We've got 79 Congressmen sending you a letter. 'Haven’t got a damn wolf in their whole district. 'I’d like to introduce them in your district. 'I introduce them in your district, you wouldn’t have a homeless problem anymore.' Hunting wolves is allowed in Alaska. Young said a healthy wolf population would 'wreak havoc and place anything in their reach in great jeopardy' After Young's remark generated backlash and requests for clarification, he released a statement. Young said his comment was an 'analogy' that was 'intended to be hyperbolic in nature' to help highlight that wolves pose a serious problem to communities in his state. He wrote: 'Anyone who’s dealt with a healthy, roaming wolf population, as we have in Alaska, understands that these predators have a detrimental impact on wildlife populations. 'If you misunderstood my comments, just imagine the impact a healthy wolf population would have on your own town, community, or congressional district. 'It would wreak havoc and place anything in their reach in great jeopardy.' There are an estimated 7,000 to 11,200 gray wolves in Alaska, according to Defenders of Wildlife. Alaska had 1,913 homeless residents in 2012 according to a Homelessness Research Institute report.","Alaska Rep. Don Young said wolves could fix homeless problem .

"A tax inspector began illegally snooping on her neighbour's finances during a seven-year argument over the location of a drainpipe. Denise Freeman abused her position at HM Revenue and Customs to pry into the tax affairs of her neighbours Garrie Conway and Flo Couper, a court heard. The row began after Denise and her husband Alasdair built an extension on to their house in Invergowrie, Perth and Kinross, and a building inspector ruled that a drainpipe on the neighbouring property came too close to the glass. The row began after Denise Freeman and husband Alasdair (right) built an extension on their house in Invergowrie, Perth and Kinross, but an inspector ruled the neighbour's drainpipe passed too close to it . Freeman used her job at HMRC to conduct an illegal investigation into Garrie Conway (pictured) after hearing he had a second job as a taxi driver and convincing herself that he was not declaring the income . The Freemans asked Mr Conway and Ms Couper to remove the pipe, and eventually sent them a lawyer's letter falsely claiming they had permission to move it themselves. When Mr Conway and Ms Couper went away on holiday for a weekend they returned to find that the Freemans had paid a building firm to relocate the pipe. Soon afterwards Mr Conway said he became concerned that Freeman seemed to know a lot about his tax affairs, and informed the authorities. Perth Sheriff Court heard that she began looking into his finances after hearing that he drove a taxi in addition to claiming benefits, and was trying to prove he hadn't declared the extra income. She said she wanted to investigate personally because the arrival of the Coalition Government had changed the culture at the tax office and they were not handing out money as freely as before. She added: 'I accessed the computer files. I was looking to see whether Mr Conway had declared a second job. 'You would have to declare any change in circumstances to the tax credits office, to HMRC. My question was whether he had a second job he was not declaring. Mr Conway said he went away on holiday for the weekend, but when he returned to his house (pictured), he found the Freemans had paid workmen to move the pipe without his permission . 'I was specifically looking at the income page. I reported he had a second job. 'If I think someone is committing tax fraud and I report them I don’t think I’m committing a crime. He made so many false complaints that people said why don’t you do something. 'I even had people saying they would sort him out for me. I know what I did was wrong.' Freeman kept the details of what she was doing a secret from her bosses at HMRC, and when police initially questioned her she denied the offences. But she later changed her plea, saying: 'I attempted to get out of it in a blind panic. 'I couldn’t say to them the real reason I did, so I probably just made up a whole load of nonsense. 'I didn’t access it for tittle tattle or gossip. I accessed it because someone told me he was committing fraud. I didn’t do it for a wee nosey. I discussed it with no-one.' Sheriff Michael Fletcher found her guilty of repeatedly making unauthorised access to the couple’s tax records without lawful reason at HMRC  between 26 September and 28 October 2011. The Freemans' two-storey extension is seen from the road running beside their house. Mr Conway branded the couple 'neighbours from hell' following their seven-year argument . An aerial view of the property reveals the large extension reaches all the way to the end of Mr Conway's garden. He said he has a folder of letters from the Freemans complaining about weeds and hedge trimming . Freeman was fined £600, while the court was also told that she has left her job at HMRC after an internal investigation. Outside court, dayshift manager Mr Conway, 48, said: 'For years and years I had said to Flo that I was suspicious that she had been looking at our tax records. 'We got a folder full of letters from the Freemans, about weeds, cutting a hedge. I always suspected she checked our records to see if we could afford to defend a civil case. 'After they took the pipe down she drove past and made a rude gesture. We had had hell from her and I decided that was the day I was going to call HMRC. 'Basically, they were neighbours from hell. We never went on holiday for five years because of them. We have moved away now. 'The thing is, we never even put the downpipe up - it was there when we bought the property.' Speaking to MailOnline, Freeman said she is appealing her conviction, says she stands by her research into Mr Conway and refutes his allegations that she made rude gestures at him.","Row started after Denise and Alasdair Freeman built house extension .

"A frail pensioner who was snatched from a care home by his concerned family and flown to Turkey to be cared for by his daughter died just five months after she was jailed by the Court of Protection. John Maddocks, 80, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, suffered from dementia and was first placed in a care home in 2009 while recovering from a bout of tuberculosis. However his daughter Wanda, 52, who was living in Turkey at the time, had promised her father she would never allow him to be put into care and became frustrated with the situation. In the following years, until his death in January 2013, she fought with the authorities to free him from the care home and even ended up imprisoned for six weeks under the secret Court of Protection. Details surrounding the case have now come to light during a three-day inquest to determine the circumstances leading up to Mr Maddocks' death. An inquest into the death of John Maddocks, 80, (right), from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, has heard how his daughter Wanda, 52 (left), was jailed for taking him out of a care home and to her Turkish home in 2009 . Wanda told the hearing how she was desperate to free her father from the first care home because she claims it was an 'awful place for him to be' and that he thought about taking his own life while there. The property developer arranged for the former painter and decorator to be moved to a nearby privately-run residential home after just two months, but said her father was so miserable that he would try to escape by fleeing on a bus or changing his clothes to disguise himself. She desperately wanted to take her father to her home in Turkey, where she believed he would enjoy better quality of life and recuperate. However, she found out from the authorities that she had no influence over her father's care without getting power of attorney over his affairs. She tried to obtain power of attorney but was told she would need up to £15,000 in legal fees. Her father was later moved to another Staffordshire care home in November 2010, but Mr Maddocks apparently hated it just as much as the other homes. Wanda said: 'He was depressed there. He wouldn't eat.' The final straw came on Christmas Day 2010 when Wanda visited her father but was told she was only allowed one hour with him, supervised by staff. She said she called her three brothers, Ivan, 55, Wayne, 54, and Eden, 49, who lived near their father and visited him regularly, and between them they hatched a plan to free him. The following day, on Boxing Day 2010, the three men went to the care home, got their father out of the fire door, took him for a meal and then called Wanda. She then took him to her home in Turkey, where he remained for 13 weeks. Mr Maddocks (above), who apparently hated being in care homes, died in hospital on January 8, 2013 . Wanda said: 'Two of my brothers got him out through the fire doors and they passed him to me and I took him to Turkey. It was the great escape.' However, the Court of Protection – which was set up to safeguard vulnerable individuals – got wind of the situation and, when Wanda flew back to the UK with her father in February 2011, the pair were prevented from returning to Turkey. Wanda said: 'We flew back to sort his pension, only to find his money had been frozen. Then the whole Court of Protection thing started. 'We were basically told that if we did not adhere to whatever decisions the Court made, we could be jailed and our assets seized.' Mr Maddocks was made the subject of a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards order and taken into care again – at Abbots House care home in Abbey Hulton, Stoke-on-Trent - while Wanda was forced to attend more than 20 court hearings and be subjected to several psychiatric evaluations. She was eventually jailed for six weeks in mid-2012 at Foston Hall women's prison near Derby, which once housed Maxine Carr, girlfriend of Soham killer, Ian Huntley. She became the first person to be jailed by the so-called 'secret court', the Court of Protection, which settles the affairs of those deemed too ill to make their own decisions. Her crime was contempt of court, for repeatedly breaking orders not to interfere with her father's life at his care home. However, she believes her only crime was an act of compassion towards the father she loved and trying to keep a solemn promise to him to keep him out of care homes. Following her release from prison, her father was moved to yet another care home in December 2012 before being taken into hospital for illness. He died weeks later on January 8, 2013. Wanda told the inquest today: 'My dad always said to me ""Don't you ever put me in a care home"" and I never forgot those words. 'There was a fair amount of disagreement between myself, social services and the city council. 'I thought it was better for him to be in the sunshine in Turkey rather than in a care home. 'They said he was too aggressive to be in the community and he had put his fist up.' Wanda (pictured) told an inquest into her father's death in Stoke-on-Trent this week that 'there was a fair amount of disagreement between myself, social services and the city council'. She was jailed for six weeks . Wanda spent six weeks in Foston Hall women's prison near Derby (pictured) after the Court of Protection ruled she had committed contempt of court. She said her only crime was compassion towards her father . The jury was also told how Wanda was happy for her father to be in a nursing home – which provides additional care – but wasn't satisfied with him being in a care home. However, staff at the care home told the inquest that Mr Maddocks was being cared for in the right place at the time. Care worker Amanda Cain said: 'We were able to meet Mr Maddocks's needs. At times he was aggressive but that could be very short-lived.' The inquest continues.

"There is always a risk when buying clothes online - sometimes the fabric feels cheap, or the colour just doesn't seem to match how it appeared on screen. Or the fit could be far less flattering in real life than online - as one woman has just discovered. The Chinese shopper bought a risqué black dress - which featured a full length sheer panel - from eCommerce site Taobao. Online shopping fail! A woman in China has been left disgruntled after the daring dress she bought online fell short of her expectations . The gown, a copy of one worn by Thor actress Jaime Alexander at the film's premiere in 2013, features features top-to-bottom see-through panels on the front and back of the dress, which mean concealing the wearer's modesty is something of a challenge. While the customer was hoping to emulate the daring look shown online, the real deal turned out to be less glamorous than she hoped. From sexy to X-rated: The cut-out dress, purchased from eCommerce site Taobao, revealed a lot more than the customer expected . Fully exposed: The full-length sheer panels show off plenty of skin front and back . The unsatisfied shopper posted comparison pictures on the seller's page, showing how the dress revealed far more than she intended. Stretched across a less petite figure, the sheer panel shows off a lot more skin and covers less of her intimate regions, turning what was a daring look into a rather more X-rated one. The shopper's pink slippers do little to help the sartorial situation as they stuck out obviously from underneath her dress, giving her a humorous look. Couture copy: The dress is a copy of one worn by Thor actress Jaimie Alexander at the film's 2013 premiere . Jaimie Alexander made headlines when she walked the red carpet in the designer version of the dress 18 months ago. The actress raised eyebrows as she risked wardrobe malfunctions in every direction, with her daring dress skirting dangerously close to her nipples, bikini line and bottom. However, her washboard stomach and statuesque figure did go some way in helping to pull off the shocking look. This isn't the first time though that disgruntled online shoppers have been let down. Earlier this year many women took to the internet to lament the fact that the dresses they had ordered looked nothing like the pictures they had been shown. Most of those duped were brides looking for an alternative to buying their wedding dress from an expensive bridal store. Many websites offer cheap copies of designer gowns, made in the Far East - but instead of using lace from Chantilly, what arrives is polyester from China. Here are some of the worst...

"Price on its head: The helmeted hornbill has become a target for poachers due to the popularity of its ivory . It is one of the world’s strangest birds, with a huge domed bill, a 6ft wingspan and a call that sounds like maniacal laughter as it echoes across the Borneo rainforest. But the helmeted hornbill is being driven towards extinction – by a surge in the black-market demand for its ivory in China. The bird – dubbed ‘the farmer of the rainforest’ for its vital seed-spreading role – has become the latest victim of organised wildlife crime, according to a report to be published this week by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). Its ivory is now worth three times more than that of elephants, and illegal poaching is spiralling out of control. Hornbill expert Yoki Hadiprakarsa warned: ‘If no one pays attention, this bird is going to become extinct.’ The illegal trade is being fuelled by the desires of China’s wealthy middle classes for carved ivory items. With ‘white’ elephant ivory and rhino horn becoming more scarce, the EIA found traffickers were dealing instead in ‘red’ ivory from a hornbill casque. This now sells for as much as £4,000 a kilo – three times the price of elephant ivory. There are no reliable estimates of the impact of poaching on populations across the hornbills’ historic range of Borneo, Sumatra and the Malaysian peninsula, but in one region alone, the Kalimantan, an estimated 6,000 birds are killed every year. Mr Hadiprakarsa, director of the Indonesian Hornbill Conservation Society, said: 'A few years ago helmeted hornbills were common in the West Kalimantan, but on my last visit I didn't see any and local villagers said they hadn't either. 'Hunters are now pushing into the remotest areas of the forest.’ The illegal trade in ivory from the birds is being fuelled by the desires of China’s wealthy middle classes for carved ivory items . Chinese visitors look at souvenirs made from ivory at a market in Angola. The ivory, which comes from helmeted hornbills, is three times the price of that of an elephant . Poachers, who shoot then decapitate the birds, often return from expeditions with as many as 20 hornbill heads. These are then sold for up to £300 each to middle men or direct to smugglers exporting to Hong Kong and China. EIA campaigner Debbie Banks said: ‘What is sickening is this trade has nothing to do with tradition or medicine – it’s purely about demand for luxury vanity products.’","The helmeted hornbill of the Borneo rainforest is being driven to extinction .

The original black and blue lace dress which created the internet sensation divided the world about what colour it actually was. Some saw it as white and gold, while others saw it as blue and black. Roman Originals produced a white and gold version of the dress, which was auctioned off on eBay for Comic Relief . The picture of #TheDress - as it became known - was first posted on Tumblr by Caitlin McNeill, a 21-year-old aspiring singer from Scotland, after noticing her friends saw different colours in the photograph. Even celebrities weighed in on the fashion debate, with Kim Kardashian asking her 29.4million Twitter followers to help settle a disagreement between herself and husband Kanye West. Actress Mindy Kaling also joined the discussion, writing on Twitter: 'IT'S A BLUE AND BLACK DRESS! ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME'. Her friend and fellow actor BJ Novak replied: 'white and gold.'

Model Chrissy Teigen told her 655,000 Twitter followers: 'F*** the dress it's heinous. While Oscar-winner Jared Leto branded it 'fugly'. McNeill said she never expected the picture to spark a star-studded debate, explaining that she just thought her followers on Tumblr would have a 'good reaction'.

"A group of writers are challenging the notion that becoming a parent is the key to a fulfilling and happy existence in a bold new anthology of essays, which explores each contributor’s conscious decision to forgo having children. Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids was edited by Los Angeles-based author Meghan Daum, 45, who curated the essays of 16 writers, including Lionel Shriver, Sigrid Nunez, Kate Christensen, Elliott Holt, Geoff Dyer and Tim Kreider, for her new book, which is slated for release on Tuesday. But the anthology doesn't take jabs at those who've decided to have children, rather it takes a look at how others have come to the decision that parenthood is not for them in a culture that worships parenthood. Being honest: Meghan Daum edited 16 writers' essays about their decision to forgo having children in her new book Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids . Just the two of us: Ms Daum, who doesn't have children, posed for this selfie with her husband . 'These essays have so many people talking about the ways that they do have relationships with kids, nieces or nephews or kids that they mentor,' Ms Daum told Flavorwire. She added: 'You’ve heard the cliché ""it takes a village"", but there are so many ways of being a responsible villager.' The writers who contributed to the book candidly explained about how they came to the decision to live a child-free existence without judgement - which is a refreshing take on a unnecessarily controversial choice that is often met with confusion and criticism. For her book, Ms Daum sought out the perspective of both men and women, although a majority of the essays in the collection are from female writers. 'I think we could be wary of the assumption that parenthood is the only way to be an adult,' Ms Daum told the outlet, noting that  'it's less taboo to say, ""I'm a shallow person"" than to say that this isn't for me.' Major debut: Ms Daum's new collection of essays will be published on Tuesday . While most conversations about parenting revolve around how women 'can have it all,' this book suggests that maybe they don't want to - or even need to. Ms Daum first thought about sharing the stories of childless adults from a variety of professions and walks of life, but she chose to curate her book with essays from writers because of their ability to 'interpret the world' in a responsible way. Most of the writers featured in the anthology are over the age of 30, Ms Daum said she 'did not have an age cutoff', but noted that it would be difficult to have someone in her twenties make a public declaration that she would never have children. Ms Daum wrote about her own choice not to have children in an essay titled Difference Maker, which appeared The Unspeakable: And Other Subjects of Discussion, her collection of persona essays that was published last year. 'After more than a decade of being told that I’d wake up one morning at age 30 or 33 -or, God forbid, 40 - to the ear-splitting peals of my biological clock, I would still look at a woman pushing a stroller and feel no envy at all, only relief that I wasn’t her,' she recalled in Difference Maker. Throughout the essay, Ms Daum recounted getting pregnant, miscarrying the baby and subsequently deciding that she didn't want to be a mother. In her new book, Ms Daum doesn't touch upon her own life with children beyond the introduction. 'I did feel that I had said all I needed to say,' she told Flavorwire about her previous work.","Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids was edited by Los Angeles-based author Meghan Daum ."
"Tycoon James Caan paid £5,000 to a firm that helps people get honours - and was later awarded a CBE. The businessman, who has appeared on the BBC’s Dragons’ Den, received the award from Prince William at Buckingham Palace last month. The gong was granted in recognition of the 54-year-old’s services to entrepreneurship and his charitable contributions. Mr Caan, who is worth £100million and was awarded a CBE by Prince William last month, paid £5,000 to Awards Intelligence, a firm that helps people get honours . But Mr Caan, who is worth £100million, has also been caught in controversy – once offering to buy a baby for £750 from a poor family in his native Pakistan. A source close to Mr Caan confirmed that he paid £5,000 to Awards Intelligence, a firm specialising in securing honours. The source said Mr Caan had already been nominated for an honour and had simply paid for ‘advice on how the system works and its procedure as he was unfamiliar with the awards process’. Mark Llewellyn-Slade, managing director of Awards Intelligence, refused to discuss any named clients of his firm, saying only that around half of them went on to secure honours. Awards Intelligence describes itself as the ‘UK’s leading Queen’s Honour Nomination Drafting Expert’. It offers to help ambitious candidates ‘receive the recognition they deserve’ by ‘crafting’ their nominations. According to managing director Mark Llewellyn-Slade around 100 clients use its services every year. They pay from £2,900 plus VAT for a lower-rung honour up to £10,900 for those seeking a knighthood. Mr Llewellyn-Slade, who is a PR expert, claims that a nomination put in by a member of the public has only a 10 per cent chance of success – compared with 50 per cent for his clients. Blame for the creation of an honours ‘industry’ can be laid at the door of John Major because when prime minister he brought in the open, ‘lollipop lady’ nominations process. His firm charges £5,900 for a nomination for a CBE to be ‘professionally drafted’. Critics of the service say it is biased against lollipop ladies and unsung heroes who cannot afford such help. The Cabinet Office, which oversees the issuing of around 2,400 honours a year, expressly says it ‘does not endorse the use of fee-charging drafting services’. Although the services are not banned, those who use them are asked to tick a box on the nomination form. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office says nominees are not told that they have been nominated for awards to avoid possible disappointment. Those offered an honour are told a month before the public announcement, giving them the chance to accept or decline. Last night a former friend of Mr Caan said: ‘Most millionaires are happy to keep a low profile and enjoy their money, but James Caan has been desperate for public recognition for years, which explains why he used to be on Dragons’ Den. ‘I knew he’d used Awards Intelligence before to successfully draft nominations for a business award, then I heard he was paying them in relation to a Queen’s honour. Now he’s got a CBE. ‘It’s a shame that ordinary people seeking honours don’t have access to the sort of advice he can afford.’ Mr Caan was previously mired in controversy after offering to buy a baby from Pakistan for £750. A source close to him brushed that incident off as an 'emotional response' to the flooding there . But the source close to Mr Caan insisted: ‘As Mr Caan had an existing relationship with Awards Intelligence he felt it entirely appropriate to seek advice on the procedural process of the UK’s honour system after he was nominated. ‘Any suggestion that Mr Caan instructed Awards Intelligence or any other third party to nominate him or to in any way exert any pressure or bring influence to bear on the honours committee to obtain an unfair advantage is completely untrue.’ The source added that Mr Caan’s rejected offer to buy a baby had been ‘an emotional response’ to the misery caused by floods in Pakistan. When asked by the Daily Mail about his honour, Mr Caan refused to comment. The tycoon was also the subject of controversy two years ago when he was made a ‘social mobility tsar’ by the Government. He criticised nepotism and said parents should let their children stand on their own two feet – but it later emerged that his daughters Hanah and Jemma had worked at his firms. One was also put on the board of trustees of his foundation.","James Caan paid Awards Intelligence to professionally draft a nomination .

"A Missouri man has broken a state record after catching a whopping 140lb paddlefish. Andy Belobraydic III snared the behemoth, measuring 56 ¾ inches long and 43 ¾ inches wide, at Table Rock Lake in The Ozarks on Saturday. The previous best was 139lb hooked in at the same location in 2002. It was the first time the 33-year-old had been out hunting the game fish after his friends urged him to go. Andy Belobraydic III snared the behemoth at Table Rock Lake in The Ozarks on Saturday. The previous best was 139lb caught at the same location in 2002 . Two days after reeling in the monster, he told the Sedalia News Journal: 'I’m still sore this morning. 'I told my buddies to take a picture of it in the water,' he added 'because I knew if I couldn’t get it in the boat, no one was ever going to believe this. When he managed to bring the fish in, one of his friends kept repeating the famous line from Jaws: 'You're going to need a bigger boat.' Belobraydic revealed he had already had a successful outing, snagging two paddlefish earlier in the day. However the third toppled the record. It took him 30 minutes of work to get the creature onto the boat. It was then taken to the Missouri Department of Conservation’s (MDC) Shepherd of the Hills Fish Hatchery near Branson, Missouri, . After weighing and measuring the fish, the record was ratified on Monday.","Andy Belobraydic III, 33, snared the behemoth at Table Rock Lake in The Ozarks on Saturday .

"Conservatives say they are happier, but liberals show more cheer in smiles, word choice and even emoticon use, claims a new scientific study. Other researchers found fault with the study, which looked at how Democrats and Republicans differ in positive language in speeches entered into the Congressional Record, photos in the congressional directory, tweets by followers of the two different political parties, LinkedIn photos associated with advocacy groups, and answers to psychological satisfaction-with-life surveys. The scientists found Democrats in Congress and liberals in general used a statistically significant amount of more positive language and smiled more with their eyes in photographs, while conservatives self-reported more satisfaction with life, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Science. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif. speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.  Conservatives say they are happier, but liberals show more cheer in smiles, word choice and even emoticon use, claims a new scientific study. The researchers examined 18 years and 432 million words of speeches in the Congressional Record, concentrating on 2013. Democrats used 13.6 positive words for every negative and Republicans used 11.5 positive words per negative. 'We're not saying liberals are happier, they behave happier,' said study co-author Peter Ditto, a professor of psychology at the University of California Irvine. 'But conservatives report being happier.' Other studies have reported that conservatives tend to score higher on tests that rate how satisfied with life they are, but University of California Irvine graduate student Sean Wojcik, the study's lead author, decided to look deeper. He looked at other indicators of happiness: words and facial expressions. The researchers examined 18 years and 432 million words of speeches in the Congressional Record, concentrating on 2013. Democrats used 13.6 positive words for every negative and Republicans used 11.5 positive words per negative. That higher rate for liberals was apparent regardless of who controlled Congress or the White House, Ditto said. For a laughing Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., this rings true: 'A lot of what seems to fuel Republican energy is anger-based. They're angry about Iran. They're angry about Obama. ... And you hear that on the floor constantly.' That's not the feeling at the office of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., where a sign above the congressman's door reads 'Fighting for Freedom and Having Fun.' His spokesman Ken Grubbs said, 'A day at the office here ... is never without lots of laughs.' Political scientist Jack Pitney said the Wojcik study was so off kilter that it seemed to be a parody, adding 'I don't think too many people will take this seriously.' A professor at Claremont McKenna College, he had many questions about the way the study was conducted and said conservatives in general want less government so this would be reflected in the language they use when talking about government. One study team member, who initially wasn't told what the project was about, examined congressional portraits to rate their facial emotions, an accepted technique in psychology. Democrats and Republicans had similar smiles around the mouth, but the more telling features for happiness are the muscles around the eyes and there Democrats looked cheerier, Wojcik said. He also found more positive language — and emoticon use — in tweets from people who followed only Democratic Twitter accounts versus only Republican account followers. Rep.  Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., disagrees with his colleague on the other side Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who spoke against H.R. 4278, the Ukraine Support Act, during the House Foreign Affairs Committee markup of the bill on Capitol Hill in Washington.   For a laughing Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, the study rings true. Several outside psychology experts told The Associated Press that while it was interesting, they didn't find the study convincing. They faulted some techniques, did not see a significant difference between the two ideologies' scores and they criticized the researchers for mixing long-term happiness in self-reporting with momentary good moods in pictures and language. 'The observed differences are quite small,' said Robert Emmons of the University of California at Davis. 'Happiness is the norm for both' Democrats and Republicans.

"Dozens of aging U.S. veterans, many in their early 90s and some in wheelchairs, gathered on the tiny, barren island of Iwo Jima on Saturday to mark the 70th anniversary of one of the bloodiest and most iconic battles of World War II. More than 30 veterans flown in from the U.S. island territory of Guam toured the black sand beaches where they invaded the deeply dug-in forces of the island's Japanese defenders in early 1945. They were bused to the top of Mount Suribachi, an active volcano, where an Associated Press photo of the raising of the American flag while the battle was still raging became a potent symbol of hope and valor to a war-weary public back home that was growing increasingly disillusioned with the seemingly unending battle in the Pacific. Scroll down for video .

The Pacific island became the site of one of the bloodiest, most famous battles of World War II against Japan . Attack: The Fifth Division Marine invaders make their way up the beach of Iwo Jima in 1945 . For some of the veterans, the return to the island where many of their comrades died, and which is still inhabited only by a contingent of Japanese military troops, brought out difficult emotions. 'I hated them,' said former Sgt. John Roy Coltrane, 93, of Siler City, North Carolina. 'For 40 years, I wouldn't even buy anything made in Japan. But now I drive a Honda.' Speeches at the Reunion of Honor ceremony held near the invasion beach were made by senior Japanese politicians and descendants of the few Japanese who survived the battle. Family members of the soldiers who died in the Battle of Iwo Jima offer water on the cenotaph on Iwo Jima . Family members of the soldiers who died in the Battle of Iwo Jima walk around a battery on Iwo Jima . Also speaking were U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the commandant of the Marine Corps, who noted that the battle for Iwo Jima remains the 'very ethos' of the Marine Corps today. 'We should never forget that the peace and prosperity of Japan and the United States at present has been built on the sacrifice of precious lives,' Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said in his remarks. This was the first time that Japanese Cabinet officials attended the anniversary ceremony, now in its 16th year. And while the presence of veterans able to make the grueling trip has been steadily dwindling, the number of participants — about 500 — was double that of last year because of the significance of the 70th year since Japan's surrender ended World War II. After the joint memorial, the U.S. and Japanese dignitaries and guests went their separate ways to visit the parts of the island that were of the most significance to their own troops. The Japanese have erected several memorials to their dead, and in a traditional way of placating their souls poured water and placed flowers on the memorial sites.

Veterans and relatives of the dead returned to the Japanese island of Iwo Jima Saturday, 70 years after one of the bloodiest battles of World War II, to commemorate the 29,000 lives claimed in the fighting . Brutal:The Battle of Iwojima lasted about a month after U.S. forces landed in February 1945. About 22,000 Japanese soldiers and 7,000 U.S. servicemen died in the battle. This photo was taken February 20 . The Marines invaded Iwo Jima in February 1945, and it was only declared secured after more than a month of fighting. About 70,000 U.S. troops fought more than 20,000 Japanese — only 216 Japanese were captured as POWs and the rest are believed to have been either killed in action or to have taken their own lives. The island was declared secure on March 16, 1945, but skirmishes continued. In about 36 days of battle, nearly 7,000 U.S. Marines were killed and 20,000 wounded.

It is to this day considered sacred ground to many Japanese. As a haunting reminder of the ferocity of the fighting, search teams continue to dig up more and more Japanese remains each year — it's estimated that 12,000 have yet to be found. The United States returned the island to Japan in 1968. Wreckage of military equipment can still be seen dotting some of the beach areas, along with pill boxes and extensive mazes of caves. Though the idea of developing the island for tourism has been mulled for decades, and possibly using its natural hot springs as an attraction, the island is virtually untouched other than the small airfield used by the Japanese. Though a tiny volcanic crag, the island — now called Ioto or Iwoto on Japanese maps — was deemed strategically important because it was being used by the Japanese to launch air attacks on American bombers. Iwo Jima, now known officially as Ioto, is seen from an airplane in Japan, Saturday, March 21, 2015.  The U.S. and Japan held the ceremony Saturday to mark the 70th anniversary of one of World War II's bloodiest battles . After its capture, it was used by the U.S. as an emergency landing site for B-29s, which eventually made 2,900 emergency landings there that are estimated to have saved the lives of 24,000 airmen who would have otherwise had to crash at sea. Twenty-seven Medals of Honor were awarded for action in the battle, more than any other in U.S. military history. The only surviving Medal of Honor recipient from Iwo Jima, Hershel 'Woody' Williams, 91, attended the ceremony. Afterward, he said his feelings toward the Japanese had not changed in the decades since the battle. 'They were just doing their jobs, just like we were,' he said. 'We tried to kill them before they could kill us. But that's war.'","More than 30 veterans flew to the island of Iwo Jima, Japan, on Saturday .

"WhatsApp first hinted it would let users make free calls to each other early last year. Now Android users can make voice calls and the feature will come to iOS soon. The latest version of the popular messaging app also has a cleaner layout with three tabs for contacts, chats and calls. The latest version of WhatsApp has a cleaner layout with three tabs for contacts, chats and calls. Users simply have to click on the ‘Calls’ tab and choose a contact to phone a friend at no cost. The screenshot on the left shows a call in progress, while the one on the right shows an incoming call from a contact . Users simply have to click on the ‘Calls’ tab and choose a contact to phone a friend at no cost. However this only works between WhatsApp users and it relies on an internet connection. The update hasn’t yet been confirmed by the Mountain View, California-based company, but users of the app have taken to Twitter to confirm its appearance on their Android handsets. Bertie C in London, said: ‘Whatsapp have calls now this is just too much #wificalling #WhatsAppCalls,’ while Dhanesh Nair tweeted: ‘Finally whatsapp call activated..#WhatsAppCalls’ The update hasn’t yet been confirmed by WhatsApp, but users of the app have taken to Twitter to confirm its appearance on their Android handsets - although it is yet to appear on iOS . Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) lets people make free, or low cost, telephone calls over the web. Popular VoIP services include Viber and Skype. VoIP can be used anywhere in the world and can call landline and mobile numbers. However, some people say they cannot see the update, which is available from the Google Play Store or WhatsApp’s site, indicating that it may not have rolled out everywhere yet. And some users aren’t that impressed. Fahida Khan tweeted: ‘#WhatsAppCalls why??? Everyone has unlimited mins these days,’ while another user said: ‘Tried #WhatsAppCalls it’s good only if u have good internet speed.' The 'Calls' feature requires an internet connection and works in a similar way to how Skype connects web-based calls - a service known as 'voice over internet protocol' or VoIP. Other messaging apps, including Viber, already offer free voice and video calls to users, and it's believed WhatsApp's update is designed to rival such services. The feature is expected to be available for iPhone users ‘in a couple of weeks,’ The Verge reported. WhatsApp rolled out the feature to selected users in January and a screenshot revealed how the service would look on a Nexus 5 handset, in February. The image showed the new ‘Calls’ tab and is incredibly similar to the newly updated version. Other messaging apps, including Viber, already offer free voice and video calls to users, and it's believed WhatsApp's update is designed to rival such services. Like Viber's app, WhatsApp shows users when they have missed a call (a screenshot is shown above) In December, Dutch site AndroidWorld uncovered clues about the feature while studying the app's test code. It then extracted layout files from the raw code to create mock-up screenshots (pictured). The new tool was only available to select users, but if someone with the feature called someone without it, it forced the update . Dutch site AndroidWorld first uncovered clues about WhatsApp's voice calling feature in December, while studying the app's test code. Expert Sander Tuit then extracted layout files, images and text from the raw code to create a series of mock-up screenshots. Skype was one of the first firms to make VoIP a mainstream technology, and last year it launched a translator. The beta version of its live translation tool lets people speak to others in another language - even if they don’t know what they’re saying. The tool then translates speech instantly, providing both text and spoken translations. The public version launched with English and Spanish translations, but the Microsoft-owned firm is looking to add more than 40 languages to the service. Google also recently added a live translation tool to is Google Translate app and this could be the next step for messaging apps such as Viber and Whatsapp. Last year, WhatsApp updated its service to make it harder to avoid messages. The Facebook-owned app displays two blue ticks in the bottom right-hand corner of an individual message to show it has been read. WhatsApp has overtaken traditional mobile phone texts for the first time as users send 30 billion messages every day. The app allows people to send instant messages and photographs via the internet rather without incurring charges from their network provider. Its growing popularity saw people send 30 billion WhatsApp messages a day last year, compared to 20 billion SMS text messages, according to research by The Economist. WhatsApp has overtaken traditional mobile phone texts for the first time as users send 30 billion messages every day. The app's logo is pictured . Messaging apps have exploded in popularity over the last few years thanks to the growth of smartphones and 3G and 4G allowing fast internet connection. But the move is predicted to hit telecoms firms hard. Research company Ovum found that the decline in the use of traditional text messages in favour of messaging apps was estimated to cost mobile network providers $54 billion by 2016. Last year, WhatsApp, which was only founded in 2009, was bought by Facebook for $19 billion - the most ever paid for a venture-capital-backed company. It was the social networking giant's biggest acquisition to date. In a statement announcing the deal, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg described WhatsApp's services as 'incredibly valuable'. WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly users and claims it is currently registering one million new users a day. It makes money by charging users a subscription fee of $1 per year, although it offers a free model as well.","App has a new, cleaner layout, including an extra tab for 'Calls'

"Cyclist Adam Jones was left to die by a callous driver who mowed him down and fled the scene . Police are hunting a driver who fled the scene after mowing down and leaving a 15-year-old cyclist to die in the road. Adam Jones was crossing a junction in West Bromwich, West Midlands, shortly after 7.30pm on Thursday when he was run over by the Volkswagen Bora. The teenager was thrown through the windscreen of the vehicle causing serious injuries. But instead of stopping to seek medical assistance, the callous driver abandoned his vehicle and fled the scene. Paramedics arrived to the junction of Beacon View Road and Walsall Road, but the young cyclist had suffered 'extensive injuries' and was confirmed dead at the scene. Friends and family paid tribute to Adam, from Wednesbury, West Midlands, who was known as 'Gadget' with dozens of flowers and balloons at the scene. Zoe Harmon wrote on Twitter: 'R.I.P Adam Jones, you'll be sadly missed, Friar Park won't be the same without you!' Police have now released shocking images of the badly damaged Volkswagen Bora in a bid to try and trace the driver. In the pictures, taken at the scene, the front end and bonnet of the blue car is crumpled and the front windscreen has also been completely ripped out. Inspector Paul Bennett, from West Midlands Police, said the car was travelling from Stone Cross towards Walsall when it hit the teenager. Police have released pictures of the damaged Volkswagen Bora in a bid to trace the driver. Pictured: the crumpled bonnet . He said: 'This was a shocking collision which has cost a young man his life and we are determined to find the person responsible for his death.

"Kidulthood actor Adam Deacon missed a court date after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act . Bafta-award winning Kidulthood actor Adam Deacon has missed a court date after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The actor and director was due to appear in court today after he was charged with affray and possession of a long-bladed sword near his home in east London, but was too unwell to attend a hearing. Police were called on the evening of January 6 to reports of a man armed with a 'machete'-style knife who was said to be threatening members of the public in Bethnal Green. Deacon, who shot to fame in the gritty film Kidulthood, did not appear at Thames Magistrates Court this morning because he was too unwell after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act, the court heard. The court clerk said: 'This case was adjourned, I believe, on the 6th March and if you look at the charge sheet, the charges concern allegations from January 6 of affray and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. 'On the last occasion the defendant wasn't in court and an adjournment period was agreed because the defendant was in hospital for treatment for underlying mental health issues.' Emek Yagmur, defending Deacon, passed a letter from the hospital the actor is receiving treatment at to the court . She said: 'He is now back in their care and he has not been released because he is not well enough to attend. He has been sectioned under section two [of the mental health act]. 'We are asking for a six-week adjournment. He is clearly not very well.' The hearing, which lasted a matter of minutes, was adjourned to April 30. The actor and director was due to appear in court today after he was charged with affray and possession of a long bladed sword near his home in east London . The panel said it wanted to see medical reports when the troubled actor, 32, next appears. Deacon, who won a Bafta rising star award for directing urban comedy Anuvahood, is also due to stand trial at Hammersmith Magistrates Court on May 11, accused of harassing fellow actor Noel Clarke on social media. Deacon was arrested back in January after failing to appear in court to face the harassment charge.

"A young woman who plunged a nine-inch kitchen knife into a fellow partygoer in a row over alcohol, has been jailed for 10 years. Samantha Houlgrave, 20, stabbed Samuel Madden because he wanted to take unopened drinks he had brought  to her house party home with him. He suffered damaged to his kidneys and liver and was told if the wound was half an inch either way he would be dead. Mr Madden had to undergo extensive surgery to make sure he was not suffering internal damage. Samantha Houlgrave was jailed for 10 years for stabbing Samuel Madden in a row over alcohol. When the 20-year-old, pictured above, is released from prison she will serve an extended three year licence period . Detective Constable Rob Sledge said Mr Madden had been left with both physical and mental scars as a result of the attack, which happened at Houlgrave's home in Blackburn, Lancashire. He said: 'They had both been drinking at Houlgrave's house.. It was a house party gone wrong. 'Mr Madden decided to leave and he wanted to take the drinks he had paid for with him. Houlgrave objected. 'She said she picked the knife up off the grass outside the house and she forgot she had it in her hand. She said she went to push Mr Madden away and that is when she stabbed him.' Mr Madden needed surgery to repair the 'nicks' in his organs. DC Sledge added: 'He will have life-long scarring and has had to have a lot of extensive surgical intervention. 'Mr Madden has been really lucky because the surgeon said if the knife had gone in half an inch either side of where it did, he would be dead.' A jury convicted Houlgrave of inflicting grievous bodily harm following a five-day trial at Preston Crown Court. Houlgrave was hauled back before the court moments after being jailed after lighting a cigarette in the cells . She was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, plus a further three on an extended licence. However the defendant was again hauled before another judge after she lit a cigarette in a cell, causing the fire alarms to sound and the building to be evacuated. Judge Anthony Russell QC said: 'It needs to be understood that it could well be a contempt of court either to bring items to court which should not be brought and certainly, to use them in a way which results in disrupting proceedings.' James Heyworth, representing Houlgrave, said she apologised for the inconvenience.","Samantha Houlgrave was convicted of grievous bodily harm by a jury .

"What does it sound like to land on the surface of Saturn’s moon Titan or fly past the Martian moon Phobos? Thanks to the European Space Agency you can listen to these sounds - and more - recreated by processing data from various spacecraft. The amazing collection of clips include some that have been artificially amplified to be audible to humans, and others that are simply as they originally sounded. The recent launch of a Soyuz rocket that took two European satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip. It took off from French Guiana at 9.46pm GMT on Friday 27 March (pictured), carrying two satellites that will expand Europe’s Galileo system . The various noises from space are shared on Esa's esaops Soundcloud page. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe as it descended onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended. According to Esa they ‘give a realistic reproduction of what a traveller on board Huygens would have heard during one minute of the descent through Titan's atmosphere.’ With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-292°F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe (illustrated) as it descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended . Elsewhere, the famous sounds of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as heard by the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae probe, are also replayed. Rosetta’s Plasma Consortium (RPC) recorded oscillations in the comet’s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz. The ‘music’ was far below the frequency heard by humans - which typically ranges from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz - but increasing the frequencies makes the noise audible.

"The founding father of modern Singapore who was both feared and admired for turning the city-state into one of the world's richest nations, has died. He was 91. Lee Kuan Yew was admitted to Singapore General Hospital on February 5 for severe pneumonia and was later put on life support. The Prime Minister's Office said in a statement posted on its website that Lee 'passed away peacefully' at the hospital at 3.18am Monday local time. Scroll down for video . Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew (pictured in 2004) has died in hospital. He was 91 . Well-wishers lay flowers and cards outside Singapore General Hospital after he became critically ill . He was admitted to Singapore General Hospital last month for severe pneumonia and later put on life support . The country's first and longest-serving prime minister, Lee guided Singapore through a traumatic split with Malaysia in 1965 and helped transform what was then a sleepy port city into a global trade and finance center. Although he could have remained in office for much longer, he stepped aside and handed over leadership of the ruling party, and the country, to a younger generation in 1990. 'In the end, my greatest satisfaction in life comes from the fact that I have spent years gathering support, mustering the will to make this place meritocratic, corruption-free and equal for all races - and that it will endure beyond me, as it has,' Lee said in his 2013 book, 'One Man's View of the World.' David Cameron said Mr Lee had transformed Singapore into one of the great success stories of the modern world. Mr Lee was hailed as having provided a number of British prime ministers with advice over the years and was once singled out by the late Margaret Thatcher as the prime minister she most admired. Mr Cameron said: 'That Singapore is today a prosperous, secure and successful country is a monument to his decades of remarkable public service. He was always a friend to Britain, if sometimes a critical one, and many British Prime Ministers benefited from his wise advice, including me. 'Lady Thatcher once said that there was no Prime Minister she admired more than Mr Lee for ""the strength of his convictions, the clarity of his views, the directness of his speech and his vision of the way ahead"". 'His place in history is assured, as a leader and as one of the modern world's foremost statesmen.' Former prime minster Sir John Major said Mr Lee was 'one of the political giants of recent history'. 'He was the architect of modern Singapore, and led the way in changing it from a small island country in Malaysia to the thriving, competitive state that it is today, punching well above its weight and admired across the world. Margaret Thatcher chats with Lee Kuan Yew on the steps of 10 Downing Street . 'Few men left a better legacy to their nation than Lee Kuan Yew, and we may not see his like again. He really was a remarkable leader, and will be much missed by those of us who were privileged to know him and work with him.' President Barack Obama also offered his condolences, calling Mr Lee 'a true giant of history.' Obama said in a White House statement that he appreciated Lee's wisdom, including during discussions they held on the president's trip to Singapore in 2009 when the president was formulating his Asia-Pacific policy. 'He was a true giant of history who will be remembered for generations to come as the father of modern Singapore and as one the great strategists of Asian affairs.' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was 'deeply saddened' by Lee's death and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the country would continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with Singapore as the region saluted one of its giants. Lee's legacy includes an efficient government with little corruption, low tax rates to attract foreign investment, excellent schools and clean and safe streets, all of which have helped Singapore rank consistently near the top of surveys of the most livable cities for expatriates. He faced criticism, though, for using tough tactics to consolidate power. He jailed some political rivals without trial for decades and brought defamation lawsuits against journalists and opposition politicians, which had a chilling effect on dissent. 'I had to do some nasty things, locking fellows up without trial,' Lee said in an interview with The New York Times published in September 2010. 'I'm not saying everything I did was right. But everything I did was for an honorable purpose.' One of his sons, Lee Hsien Loong, is Singapore's current prime minister. He also is survived by another son, Lee Hsien Yang, and a daughter, neurologist Lee Wei Ling. His wife of more than 60 years, Kwa Geok Choo, died in October 2010. Born September 23, 1923, Lee grew up speaking English in a Singapore that was part of the British colonial empire, and was known as Harry during much of his early life. His university education was interrupted by the three-year Japanese occupation of the island in the Second World War. The Queen and Mr Lee share a light moment together during a state banquet at the Indonesian presidential palace in 1989 . Mr Lee shakes hands with former Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street in 2003 . 'The Japanese demanded total obedience, and got it from nearly all,' he wrote in his memoirs. 'My appreciation of governments, my understanding of power as the vehicle for revolutionary change, would not have been gained without this experience.' After completing his studies at Singapore's Raffles College, Lee went to England to study law at Cambridge University. There, he married Kwa, a fellow student, in 1947. He returned to Singapore in 1950 and started the law firm Lee & Lee with his wife in 1955. In 1954, Lee helped found the People's Action Party and he became Singapore's first prime minister in 1959 when Britain granted it self-governance in all matters except defense and foreign affairs. Singapore declared independence from Britain in 1963, and Lee, believing his island couldn't survive alone, brought it into the federation of neighboring states that became Malaysia. But the Malay leadership asked Singapore to leave after two years because of ideological differences. Lee wept on national television while announcing the breakup, which he later would call one of his biggest political regrets. He then turned to governing his tiny island state, imposing strict policies that some saw as micromanaging the daily lives of Singaporeans. Lee outlawed the sale of chewing gum, promoted English and Mandarin while banning other Chinese dialects from public schools, radio and TV. He also enforced ethnic integration by controlling the makeup of public apartment buildings, where 80 percent of the population lives. Lee also cracked down on organized crime and imposed harsh penalties for minor infractions, a policy that has helped Singapore maintain one of the world's lowest violent crime rates. Drug couriers face mandatory hanging, vandals are sometimes caned - such as American teenager Michael Fay in 1994 despite a plea for leniency from President Bill Clinton - and litterbugs must pay a hefty fine.

"A top Department of Homeland Security official improperly used his influence to help Tony Rodham – Hillary Clinton's youngest brother – with visas for his company's foreign investors, according to a new inspector general report. Investigators said Alejandro Mayorkas helped efforts to secure the visas in ways that created the appearance of favoritism and special access. He also helped Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe's green-car venture in 'unprecedented' fashion, according to the inspector general, and a casino company whose success was a pet project of then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Mayorkas was at the time in charge of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Mrs. Clinton's latest 'brother eruption' could complicate her quest for the White House. Hillary Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham (left) benefited from the improper influence of a top Homeland Security official who intervened to help his clients get special visas for their overseas investors, according to a new inspector general report . Alejandro Mayorkas, now the no. 2 official at Homeland Security, headed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services when Rodham approached him for 'unprecedented' help . 'Brother eruption': Hillary's older brother Hugh (right) made unwelcome news at the end of President Bill Clinton's tenure by successfully lobbying him to commute the federal drug-dealing prison sentence of a Democratic Party donor's son. TROUBLE: Hillary Rodham Clinton is poised for a presidential run and her brothers' histories could come back to haunt her . When she was first lady, a series of embarrassing episodes including both Tony and Hugh Rodham led White House staffers to refer to them with an eye-roll as 'the brothers Rodham.' Hillary's older brother Hugh made unwelcome news at the end of President Bill Clinton's tenure by successfully lobbying him to commute the federal drug-dealing prison sentence of a Democratic Party donor's son. Hugh had been paid $400,000 by the donor to lobby for that outcome. He later returned the money as a scandal grew. At the time, Mayorkas – already a Rodham friend – intervened and spoke to the White House about the request, something he conceded during his 2009 Senate confirmation hearing was a mistake. Hillary, then a freshman U.S. senator from New York, distanced herself from her brother in a press conference. 'I did not know my brother was involved in any way in any of this,' she said at the time. 'I did not have any involvement in the pardons that were granted or not granted, and I'm just very disappointed about my brother's involvement.' Separately, Tony Rodham had his own brush with presidential pardon embarrassment, successfully pressing President Clinton to pardon a Tennessee couple convicted of bank fraud. Clinton overruled objections from the Justice Department in granting that request. Tony Rodham claimed he received no money in exchange for his access to the Oval Office, but the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee later found that he was paid as a consultant. More recently, a book due out in May describes a scheme involving an alleged sweetheart deal Tony Rodham benefited from in Haiti. He was a board member of a North Carolina mining company that enjoyed prime access to Haitian gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by Bill Clinton. That work was conducted through the Clinton Foundation, a philanthropy that now bears Hillary's name. Virginia's Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe (right), shown with  Prince Charles and Carol Cadou, Senior Vice President for Historic Preservation at Mount Vernon, got special favors for his green-technology firm . The latest Rodham embarrassment, revealed Tuesday, involves influential Democrats who sought help from Tony with securing visas as part of a complicated foreign investor program. The U.S. government's investor-visa program, known as EB-5, allows foreigners to obtain visas to live permanently in the U.S. with their spouses and children if they invest $500,000 to $1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for American citizens. Jeh Johnson, U.S. secretary of Homeland Security, said Mayorkas is 'exceptionally conscientious, honest and patriotic' – despite his link to the latest scandal . Approved investors can become legal permanent residents after two years and later can become U.S. citizens. Tony Rodham ran Gulf Coast Funds Management, a firm that specialized in recruiting foreign investors and securing their EB-5 visas. GreenTech Automotive, run by now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe – who was Bill Clinton's top fundraiser in the 1990s – contracted with Gulf Coast. Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth wrote that he didn't know why Mayorkas intervened in the cases, and didn't accuse him of violating any laws. But he criticized the long-time Democratic legal eagle for using his influence improperly. Roth also praised as 'courageous' the agency employees who confidentially had complained about Mayorkas' actions and promised they would be protected as whistleblowers. Mayorkas said in a statement that he disagreed with Roth's findings but added that 'I will certainly learn from it and from this process.' He added: 'There was erroneous decision-making and insufficient security vetting of cases. I could not and did not turn my back on my responsibility to address those grave problems. I made improving the program a priority and I did so in a hands-on manner.' The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, said the findings were 'extremely concerning' and that he will conduct a congressional hearing about them Thursday. Roth was expected to testify. Hillary Clinton's brothers Hugh Rodham (left) and Tony Rodham (right) have been intermittent sources of embarrassment since her days ad first lady during the 1990s . SLS Las Vegas, a casino that opened late last year, benefited from undue influence in securing foreign investors with the promise of visas that could lead to US citizenship . The White House praised Mayorkas on Wednesday when asked about the brewing scandal, saying he still works at DHS 'because he is a decorated public servant and an effective leader of that organization.' Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the president and his advisers 'certainly value the kind of contribution that he has made to the effective management of that department, and he has played an important role in implementing needed reforms in that department.' In fact, Earnest told Fox News' Ed Henry, Mayorkas is 'leading the effort' to implement reforms in the department in question and 'strengthen' the EB-5 program. After Henry expressed shock at White House's full-throated support in the Homeland Security official who 'basically gave special visas and access to politically-connected Democrats,' Earnest said, 'To be clear, Ed, the Inspector General, who, as you point out, did take a close and independent look at this, did not suggest that these individuals weren’t deserving of a visa.' 'What he suggested is merely that the process didn’t work very well,' Obama's spokesman said. 'These are exactly the problems that Deputy Secretary Mayorkas was trying to address, and there are additional reforms that are needed, and there will be additional reforms that are implemented.' Refusing to let Earnest off the hook, Henry asked if Mayorkas was trying to make reforms when he let Hillary Clinton's brother 'jump to the front of the line.' 'That's not the accusation, Ed,' the White House spokesman fired back. 'Go back to the inspector general report - that is not what it said,' a visibly agitated Earnest told him. The inspector general's new conclusions also cast doubt on whether the Homeland Security Department withheld embarrassing internal files the AP had sought under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act as part of its own investigation nearly two years ago – and instead released records that indicated no wrongdoing. The AP in July 2013 requested all emails to or from Mayorkas over the preceding seven months that contained specific words or names, including Rodham. The government eventually sent AP more than 200 pages, mostly censored, including emails in which Mayorkas told investors and agency staff that he would not become involved in internal deliberations. 'I cannot weigh in,' Mayorkas wrote to Assistant Secretary Douglas Smith on Feb. 1, 2013, in a message turned over to the AP and cited in the new inspector general's report. 'The (investor's) attorney sent an email to me and I responded that I could not weigh in.' But the inspector general's report also cited other messages from Mayorkas that were never turned over to the Associated Press. In one case, Mayorkas forwarded a January 2013 email from Rodham about delays with a high importance designation. The email would have been covered under AP's information request since Mayorkas sent it during the relevant time period and contained Rodham's name. 'Staff understood these applications were getting high-level attention,' the inspector general's report said. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, another Democrat, was also connected to the investor proposal but later divested. His spokesman, Brian Coy, said the report demonstrated that McAuliffe asked the government to decide on the investment proposal in a timely fashion. The other two cases involved a Hollywood investment program and an investment effort in Nevada that had ties to former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, respectively. The Reid-related project was SLS, a casino project that he didn't invest in but advocated strongly for as Nevada's senior senator. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said there were lessons to be learned in the inspector general's investigation but described Mayorkas in a statement as 'exceptionally conscientious, honest and patriotic.' 'He is often impatient with our sluggish government bureaucracy, can at times be very hands-on in resolving issues and problems that are brought to his personal attention, and is always mindful that we are public servants,' Johnson said. 'Ali works hard to do the right thing, and never acts, in my observation, for reasons of personal advancement or aggrandizement.'","Tony Rodham used influence from Alejandro Mayorkas, then the head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services .

"A mystery 'food source' sickened nearly 100 restaurant patrons in Philadelphia last month, but city and state health officials say state law bars them from disclosing what the food was or how it was contaminated. Dozens of lawyers and law students from Temple University became sick after a February 27 feast at Joy Tsin Lau in the city's Chinatown. Some said they were bedridden and others had to seek medical attention after coming down with food poisoning, but the owner insisted her restaurant was not the culprit. Stomach-turning: Dozens of lawyers and law students from Temple University became sick with vomiting and explosive diarrhea after a February 27 feast at Joy Tsin Lau in the city's Chinatown . 'It was not a problem with my restaurant,' Chi Mabel Chan told Philadelphia Inquirer. 'Maybe they got cold or drank too much.' A 'food source' was identified as the cause of the outbreak, but city Health Department spokesman Jeff Moran declined to explain what the food was or how it was contaminated, citing state law that bars them from disclosing findings of investigations. Wes Culp, a spokesman for the state Department of Health, said the law prohibits disclosure of 'diseases or any records maintained as a result of any actions taken in consequence of those reports.' 'We do not disclose information related to an investigation unless there is a public health purpose to sharing the information,' Culp said in an email. In a report two weeks prior to the outbreak, a city Health Department employee cited the restaurant for multiple violations, including a lack of soap and paper towels in the employee restroom, which was noted as a repeat violation. The February 10 report stated in part: 'Potentially hazardous ready to eat food, prepared in the food facility and held for more than 48 hours, located in the walk in cooler, was not date marked.' The health department inspector also found that multiple food items located inside a refrigerator beneath the counter were not covered 'to prevent possible contamination.' In 2010, the Health Department issued a cease-and-desist order against Joy Tsin Lau alleging 'failure to ensure that public-health standards for a safe and sanitary operation' are being maintained. About 250 people attended the ill-fated banquet celebrating the Lunar New Year at the landmark Chinese restaurant at 1026 Race Street. The owner insisted her restaurant was not the culprit, suggesting that the afflicted diners drank too much or came down with a cold . At the event, which doubled as a fundraiser for the Temple university Asian Pacific American Law Student Association, guests were served an eight-course dinner featuring Peking duck, walnut shrimp, spare ribs, deep-fried fish and a host of other dishes. One of the patrons at the restaurant that night was David Haase, a Philadelphia attorney, who told Daily Mail Online in an email Friday that the mystery illness felled him 30 hours after the feast and kept him bedridden for four days. He recalled that while none of the dishes he had that night tasted ‘spoiled’ per se, he noticed that nearly all of the food was barely lukewarm. ‘I was disappointed with the overall quality of the food, but I did not give it too much thought because I was there to support the terrific law school organization hosting the event,’ Mr Haase wrote to Daily Mail. ‘All of my colleagues at our firm's table were similarly disappointed with the quality of the food but we just made the best of it.’ Mr Haase noted that their table did send back the first pot of tea because there was food crusted on the spout. The dinner was Friday night. On Saturday, Haase piled his family into his SUv and drove five hours to State College, where his 16-year-old daughter was set to compete in a track championship the following day. But at around 4am Sunday, disaster struck. The lawyer, whose firm sponsors a table at the banquet every year, revealed that he suffered from a wicked combination of projectile vomiting, explosive diarrhea and intense stomach cramps that made him moan in bed. ‘I have never been more sick,’ he recalled. ‘Vile fluids were coming out of every orifice.’ Star-crossed diners: Attorney David Haase (left) and medical researcher Jack Jiang (right) were among the patrons who found themselves bedridden with food poisoning after the banquet . Mr Haase also addressed head-on the restaurant owner’s suggestion that perhaps the ailment was brought on by her guests overindulging in alcohol, or coming down with a cold. ‘I was perfectly healthy when I attended the dinner, I was appropriately dressed in a suit and overcoat (I never ‘got cold’), and I did not go drinking at a karaoke bar afterwards,’ he stated. Fellow diner Jack Jiang, a medical researcher at University of Pennsylvania, attended the celebration with his girlfriend. Jiang recounted to Philadelphia Inquirer how he had spent three days in bed writhing in pain and 'exploding out of all orifices' following the infamous dinner. David Haase said that while normally he is not inclined to sue anyone, and he does not have the time to pursue legal action, he said he just might make an exception in this case and ‘set aside some precious time to educate’ the owner of the restaurant.","Dozens of lawyers and law students from Temple University became sick after a February 27 feast at Joy Tsin Lau .

"Taco Bell has launched a new advert for their breakfast menu where they appear to compare competitors McDonalds to a communist dictatorship.

It is not clear what impact this is having on McDonald's Corp, which has been struggling to hold on to customers amid intensifying competition. But others have also been pushing into the breakfast category more aggressively, including Starbucks, which revamped its sandwiches last year.","The new TV advert aims to build on Taco Bell's new breakfast menu items .

Sleepwalking defense: Mitchell's attorney argued that his client (left) was not conscious of the night of September 22, 2010, when he strangled to death his 4-year-old son, Blake (right) Desperate cry: Reacting to the verdict, the grieving mother exclaimed in court: 'I failed. I couldn't save him' Devastated: Christine Perolini was so stunned by the ruling that she hyperventilated and had to be wheeled out on a stretcher . Mitchell, 50, sobbed after the shocking verdict, but made no comment as he walked out of court a free man. His ex-wife, Christine Perolini, was so stunned by the ruling that she hyperventilated and had to be wheeled out on a stretcher surrounded by her family. Reacting to the verdict, the grieving mother exclaimed in court: 'I failed. I couldn't save him [Blake].' Mitchell testified that he was in financial distress and had not been sleeping well around the time of 4-year-old Blake Mitchell's death in September 2010. Prosecutors said those financial difficulties drove Mitchell to strangle the toddler and try to kill the others. Mitchell's 13-year-old and 10-year-old children testified in court that they fought him off. But a defense expert said Mitchell's stress and lack of sleep likely resulted in 'non-REM parasomnia,' a sleep disorder whose sufferers can perform random acts unconsciously. Because of this disorder, he was incapable of exercising criminal intent, the expert said. A psychologist who testified for the prosecution after repeatedly interviewing Mitchell said he had no mental condition that would have left him unconscious during the attacks, and that he must have consciously planned them. Mitchell's trial lasted a month but it took the jury less than four hours to return a not guilty verdict. Following Mitchell's acquittal, some members of the jury panel spoke out saying that they did not believe the sleepwalking defense, but their hands were tied. Prosecutors said extreme financial difficulties drove Mitchell to strangle the toddler and try to kill his two older children . Emotional: Mitchell, 50, sobbed after the shocking verdict . He left the courtroom a free man . Daddy's boy: A defense expert said Mitchell's stress and lack of sleep likely resulted in a sleep disorder whose sufferers can perform random acts unconsciously- including killing his son . Speaking to the station WRAL, one juror said she was ‘embarrassed’ to be a part of this case and compared the experience to being 'dragged into someone else's nightmare.' The woman said that she and her fellow jurors had no choice but to acquit Blake Mitchell's killer of first-degree murder. ‘We would have definitely convicted him of manslaughter,’ the juror said. ‘We felt like our hands were tied.’ Referring of Mitchell, whom the prosecution painted as a serial liar and a man desperate to get out of a financial bind, another juror said: ‘I didn't believe one word out of that man's mouth.' The general opinion on the jury panel was that the prosecution had to prove malice and intent to get a conviction on a first-degree murder charge, but they failed to do it. During the month-long trial, defense attorney Jay Ferguson asked Judge James Roberts to allow the jury to consider an involuntary manslaughter conviction, but his request was denied. Alexis Mitchel (top right), now 18 years old, said in court that her father tried to push her head between her bed and a wall while wearing a Halloween mask. She fought back and survived, as did her other brother, Devin (far left) Free man: Joe Mitchell is pictured here Wednesday evening leaving left the jail accompanied by his lawyer and carrying several garbage bags filled with his possessions . Mitchell has never denied strangling his son Blake on the night of September 22, 2010, at the family's foreclosed home in Hillsborough, North Carolina, but his attorney argued that he did it uncontrollably and without malice while sleepwalking. Prosecutors described how Joe Mitchell tried to push his daughter's head between her bed and a wall while wearing a Halloween mask. The girl fought back and survived, along with her brother Devin, reported ABC11. Blake, however, was not as lucky. Alexis Mitchell, now 18 years old, said in court she passed out and was later awakened by her baby brother's screams. ‘I remember seeing my father on my other little brother [Devin], and I tried to get him off of him,’ Alexis testified. ‘He was trying to hurt him. I ran to my mother’s room and told her what was happening, and she told me to go get my brothers.’ When Alexis returned to her siblings’ room, she picked up Blake in her arms, not knowing he was dying. The teen said she thought the toddler was asleep. At around 6pm Wednesday, Joe Mitchell left the jail a free man accompanied by his lawyer and carrying several garbage bags filled with his possessions. Defense attorney Jay Ferguson told the station the acquittal is bittersweet for the 50-year-old man, who has no money and no home after spending four years behind bars. He added that it is his client’s wish to reunite with his ex-wife and surviving children.","North Carolina jury decided unanimously that Joseph Mitchell, 50, is not guilty of murder and attempted murder .

"A 75-year-old Virginia woman choked a raccoon to death after the rabid animal bit her on the leg. Cas Overton, of Henrico County near Richmond, was walking through the Lewis Ginter Botanical Gardens and looking at birds when she was confronted with the aggressive mammal. She tried to shake it off unsuccessfully, and strangled the animal around the neck for five minutes after realizing how violent it was. Scroll down for video . Cas Overton, 75, of Henrico County, Virginia, was birdwatching when she was attacked by a rapid raccoon . 'You know self-preservation kicks in, and I guess a primitive part of my brain just went into operation and that was it,' she told the Richmond Times Dispatch. 'If I ran, it would be faster than I would and would just tear me to pieces,' Ms Overton, who was a Tai Chi instructor for 40 years, said. The septuagenarian was taken to the hospital after the Saturday incident on one of the gardens' backroads, and has received multiple preventative vaccines for rabies since. Tests later confirmed that the animal carried the disease, according to ABC8. The elderly woman spent five minutes choking the raccoon to death before being she was taken from Lewis Ginter Botanical Gardens to the hospital and given preventative rabies vaccines . Raccoons are the leading carrier of rabies in the eastern United States, with roughly 35 per cent of all animal rabies cases occurring in the species (file photo) Ms Overton said it 'took a while' to figure out that she had killed her attacker, and that she is an animal lover who has been walking in the gardens for 30 years. The Humane Society says that raccoons suffer most from rabies in the eastern US, making up more than a third of all animals rabies cases. Both raccoons and skunks, another common rabies carrier, are nocturnal. Activity during the day is an abnormal behavior that could indicate the presence of the disease. Pets such as dogs are particularly vulnerable to rabies, which is a nervous system disease only transmitted by saliva. Animal owners are urged to vaccinate their pets to stop the spread of the disease in the event of a wild animal attack.

"A family friend, identified only as Natalia, has revealed that the home Nina Obukhov shared her family had at least one hundred guns in it belonging to husband Alexey Obukhov . A friend of the 34-year-old mother who shot and killed her two young daughters at their upscale New Hampshire home before turning the gun on herself was described by a friend as a quiet woman who never said anything bad about her family. The family friend, identified only as Natalia, told MyFoxBoston that she it was a big shock that Nina Obukhov had killed her two daughters, 8-year-old Katherine and 6-year-old Elizabeth. ‘No one ever saw her sad or mad. We learned from her, she was so optimistic and kind,’ she said. Natalia also said she didn’t like to bring her son for playdates at the Obukhov's home because she wasn't not comfortable with number of guns that Nina's gun store owner husband Alexey had lying around the home . ‘It was too dangerous to have kids and so many guns in the same place,’ she said. She estimated that there were at least one hundred guns at the property. Police have ruled the deaths as a murder-suicide and assistant attorney general Jay McCormack said police received a 911 call on Saturday regarding a deceased woman at the home in Bedford. When officers arrived, they found two more bodies. Scroll down for video . Murder-suicide: Nina Obukhov, 36, was found dead at this upscale Bedford, New Hampshire, home after killing her two young daughters, ages 6 and 8, and then herself . A makeshift memorial appears on display in front of the Obukhov residence on McAfee Farm Road . Autopsies confirmed that all three died of gunshot wounds to the head. The girls' deaths were ruled homicides. The manner of the mother's death remained undetermined, but authorities said it appeared the mother shot the girls and then committed suicide. Flowers and stuffed animals were left next to a pile of yellow police tape outside the home on Monday morning. At the school Katherine, known as 'Katy,' attended, officials were trying to provide the children with as much normalcy as possible while also making grief counselors available. Deidre Helmke's son was in the same class as Katy for both first and second grade as part of a class that stayed together for their first two years of elementary school. Helmke, who served as 'room mother' for first grade at riddle Brook Elementary School, described it as a tight-knit group. On Monday, she was flipping through school yearbooks looking at pictures of Katy, whom she remembered as a 'little peanut.' 'She was a sweet little blonde-haired girl, quiet,' Helmke said. Helmke said Nina Obukhov was quiet. While she didn't know her well, she saw Obukhov at school and occasionally bumped into her while running errands. It is believed that Alexey Obukhov and his wife Nina lived in the home with their two daughters, aged 6 and 8 . 'She didn't stand out as being any different from any other mom,' she said. 'She would chat a bit about the kids and then move on.' While school officials notified parents about the deaths on Sunday, they did not identify the victims, leaving Helmke and other parents unsure what to tell their children. Not wanting him to find out at school, she told her son that she 'heard a report that Katy passed away.' He teared up and wanted to know how. 'I told him I honestly don't know, and I gave him a hug,' she said. On Sunday, police were searching for Nina Obukhov's gun store owner husband, Alexey, but Monday's news release by the attorney general's office made no mention of the missing man. Police were searching for Russian gun store owner Alexey Obukhov after three people were found dead at an upscale New Hampshire home Saturday . Although police have said they are not looking for suspects, a 'be-on-the-lookout alert' was issued by National Emergency Alerts - New England at about 11.40pm on Saturday on Facebook. The statement announced that they were looking for Obukhov and his maroon BMW coupe with New Hampshire plates. Obukhov is the owner of a guns and ammo shop in Merrimack, which made headlines in 2013 after hanging pictures of President Barack Obama with Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong and calling Obama 'firearm salesman of the year'. He is also the owner of a company called New Vector Corporation, according to online records. He also is the president of Collectible Arms and Ammo II Corp. Obukhov had previously been arrested in August 2013 for a domestic violence assault but the charges were dismissed after his wife declined to testify, according to the Bedford Patch. National Emergency Alerts - new England, however, issued a 'be-on-the-lookout alert Saturday evening looking for a man named Alexey Obukhov . State and Bedford Police, along with a SWAT Team arrived on scene on Saturday. Police continued to investigate at the house throughout the day on Sunday . Then last year he filed a civil lawsuit against Bedford Police Chief John Bryfonski, seeking that all of his firearms and ammunition be returned to him . The lawsuit was denied, but Obukhov sued and in November, the state's highest court ordered that Obukhov's application for a pistol revolver license be granted even though Bryfonski believed that he was unsuitable to possess a concealed weapon, according to court records. New Hampshire State Police and SWAT vehicles were on the scene in Beford, blocking off the street and access to the home. The Attorney's General Office is also part of the investigation. Very few details about the case have been released, and causes of death and names of victims are being withheld pending the notification of family .

"Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has said he will not leave the BBC show without a fight - and is already considering a new show based around farming. Clarkson is said to be in discussions with Andy Williams, his long standing collaborator and Top Gear's executive producer, to star in a new farming show - just days after he launched into an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala. Speculation is mounting over what will happen to one of the BBC's biggest stars when his fate is finally decided at a meeting this week. Jeremy Clarkson (pictured on Countryfile) is said to be in discussions with Andy Williams, Top Gear's executive producer, over starring in a new farming show . He told the Sunday Mirror today that he has been 'put on silence' which is why he has been refusing to comment on the allegations he punched Oisin Tymon, a 36-year-old Top Gear producer, in a row over the lack of catering. Clarkson told the paper: 'I've been put on silence. There are very good reasons from my point of view why I simply can't say a word.' His future at the BBC is to be decided next week when the corporation's internal probe into his 'fracas' with Mr Tymon is put before Director-General Tony Hall. But sources close to the presenter told the paper that if he is sacked he will probably sue for wrongful dismissal. They said he is still 'fuming' about the top BBC boss who allegedly compared his situation to paedophile Jimmy Savile's - and  has vowed to find out who it was. Clarkson was embroiled in a row with BBC after he allegedly punched his producer Oisin Tymon . An insider said Clarkson thinks BBC bosses have launched a smear campaign against him and he 'won't let that go'. The paper also revealed that the BBC are already filming the pilot of an alternative motoring show called 'The Getaway'. The Sunday Times has reported that Clarkson is already considering a change in direction - and may become the face of a new documentary series on farming. The paper reports Clarkson originally took the idea to then BBC director General George Entwistle in 2012 but it did not get the go-ahead. But following the now infamous fracas and the uncertainty surrounding his current job, Clarkson it said to be preparing a new proposal for the show. A source told the paper: 'In the last week Jeremy has had a chance to firm it up. It's about trying to run a farm when you don't know anything about farming and getting things wrong... in a Top Gear-esque way.' In 2012, Clarkson told the Radio Times: 'I love the idea of being a farmer, that's why I like watching Adam's Farm [on Countryfile]. But farming land is complex. It's a business, but it's important to me that the land looks beautiful too.'","Jeremy Clarkson is said to be keen to appear in a new farming show .

In what Cumbria Police admit is 'very unusual behaviour', the man, who wears a tweed jacket, first smacked a woman round the head after she sneezed in Carlisle town centre on Monday.

Sgt Gill Cherry of Cumbria Police said the pensioner was left feeling 'confused and upset'. Police were informed about the first attack by witnesses – but have yet to trace the victim. Cumbrian Police described their strange suspect as being in his mid-to-late 50s and wearing a plush, tweed jacket. The force have now asked for anyone with any information about, or who witnessed, the two related incidents to contact them. Sgt Gill Cherry from said: 'We are treating these two reported incidents as linked, and are appealing to the local community to help trace the man responsible.

'If anyone smacked me for sneezing I would smack them back. 'If anyone saw someone do something like that I would be surprised if they did not do something as you wouldn't stand for it if you witnessed it.' Trainee shop assistant Gemma Prosser, 19, added: 'We heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird.

Deen, looking slimmer after losing 40lb in the wake of her Type 2 diabetes diagnosis, was introduced by presenter Michael Symon as 'our good friend'. 'It's like coming to see family,' said the celebrity cook who also found time to plug her new game Paula Deen's Recipe Quest. 'It's easy ya'll!' Deen's boisterous good humur got rather crass at one point when she scolded Clinton Kelly for eating hot wings with a knife and fork. 'It's easy ya'll!'

In the same week that students were expelled from Oklahoma University for using the N-word, at least one person thought it ironic that Deen was back on television. In 2012 Deen was sued by a former employee who claimed the then-beloved Southern chef and her brother had made racist remarks at their Savannah, Georgia restaurant. In a court deposition, she admitted to using the 'N word' and later released a video, in tears, apologizing for the incident.

"In Cuba's socialist wonderland even the stray dogs are issued with identification cards and provided with state sponsored accommodation and health care. More than a dozen state institutions have 'adopted' a stray dog, which is then issued with an official state identity card bearing its photograph name and where it lives. Five of the dogs live at Old Havana's Museum of Metalwork and regularly patrol the streets after hours. When not patrolling, each of the dogs can be found sleeping underneath the institution's grand stairway. Vladimir the former street dog now lives at the Old Havana Museum of Metalwork in Havana, Cuba . Each of the street dogs is given an official identity badge with its photograph and contact details . Security Guards Dary Valdes, left, and Margarita Garcia, right, enjoy looking after their unusual colleagues . The dogs, Vladimir, Canela, Aparicio, Leon and Carinoso spend the days avoiding the hot Caribbean sun among the museum's artworks. All of the dogs afforded the special status are immune from the attentions of Havana's dog catcher. Yarisbel Perez, who works in one of the historic buildings in Plaza Vieja, in the centre of the old city, said: 'I don't like dogs but I've really developed a soft spot in my heart for them.' Ms Perez and her colleagues are responsible for two dogs, Nina and P9, who is named after a bus line in the city. Ms Perez feed her dogs half-eaten pork chips and left-over chicken and rice from a nearby restaurant. Ordinarily, all animals are banned from workplaces in Cuba with the exemption of guard dogs. Nora Garcia, President of the Cuban Association for the Protection of Plants and Animals said the dogs were afforded their special status after a guard was awoken one night by a barking dog who noticed some people were looking to steal an air conditioning unit. Guard Yarisbel Perez said she did not initially like the dogs but has since developed a soft spot for them . The dogs are afforded special protection from Havana's dog catcher because of their security role . Leon, Canela, Vladimir and Aparicio pictured are four of the five dogs at the metalwoork museum . Ms Garcia said: 'There was a public ceremony in which the dog received an award for saving the air conditioners.' Some security guards adopt the dogs to alleviate the boredom of protecting buildings in a city with little crime. Victoria Pacheco, who works in the metalwork museum said: 'They don't eat bones. They eat cold cuts, mincemeat, hotdogs and liver.' The animal protection society maintains a list of 21 dogs living in state institutions, including a Communist Party gas station, offices of the Cuban Journalists' Union and a mechanical workshop of the Ministry of Public Health. Dalia Garcia, caretaker of a public toilet has taken responsibility for two of the dogs. 'They stay here and nothing happens to them. Everyone takes care of them, no one hits them. They don't bark and they don't bite anyone.' Each of the dogs is provided with free healthcare and accommodation by the state institutions invovled . Dogs without the special name tag face being detained by the dog catcher and possibly destroyed . Other dogs haven't been so lucky, including a group snatched by the dogcatcher from Havana's University of Arts while their student protectors were home on vacation, Garcia said. 'They're official for us but the state doesn't always look so kindly on them,' she said. 'When they come and say there can't be any dogs here, they have to go.' Similarly sad fates await street dogs who aren't chosen for special treatment by state workers, including some of the dogs who wander, matted and skinny, through groups of quasi-official dogs on the streets of Old Havana. 'Sometimes we feel bad and we give them something to eat,' Perez said. 'But if we start taking care of all of them, it would get to be a zoo around here.'","Dozens of state institutions in Cuba have decided to adopt a stray dog .

The tradesman was flown by helicopter on Sunday and taken aboard, while a temporary pipeline was used to refuel the ship, which had to remain offshore due to a build-up of ice in the harbour. The ship will negotiate about 100 nautical miles of ice before reaching open water to embark on the voyage of about two weeks back to Hobart.

"The owner of a property near GCHQ where Banksy daubed his ‘Spybooth’ artwork has claimed that the mural had made his life a misery after being given listed status. David Possee could have expected a windfall after the work was sprayed onto the side of his end-of-terrace property close to Britain's surveillance centre in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. But after the stencil was granted Grade II-listed status, Mr Possee, 45, has been unable to remove and sell it - and cannot carry out building work to make the house habitable. Scroll down for video . Eavesdropping: Spybooth features three 1950s-style agents, wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats, using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box on the side of the £300,000 property . Public interest: Dozens of people came to see the artwork after it was sprayed onto the side of an end-of-terrace property close to Britain's surveillance centre in April 2014 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . As a result he cannot rent out the home, which is empty. He claimed he has been harassed by ‘malicious busybodies’ and now just wants to sell the property - so he can ‘get on with my life’. Mr Possee said: ‘If Cheltenham want it, they can have it. Just buy the building off me, I just want to get on with my life. Cut me free, you can have the Cheltenham Banksy.’ Spybooth features three 1950s-style agents, wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats, using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box on the side of the £300,000 property.

The wall was boarded up but a bidding war ensued as locals tried to raise an estimated £1million to secure it for the town. A businessman claimed to have raised enough, but his bid fell through. Protection: Scaffolding was put up over the artwork after it was vandalised. After the stencil was granted Grade II-listed status, Mr Possee, 45, has been unable to remove and sell it . Covering: It was feared the chunk of wall could be removed and sold, but last month Cheltenham Borough Council voted to incorporate the mural into the building’s existing Grade II-listed status . It was feared the chunk of wall could be removed and sold, but last month Cheltenham Borough Council voted to incorporate the mural into the building’s existing Grade II-listed status. This means Mr Possee - whose home is thought to have tripled in value since the mural was painted - now cannot carry out urgent repairs to strengthen and re-render the walls. He said: ‘If this had been any other artist, it [the listed status] would have been laughed out of the chambers. I have no idea where I go from here.' Mr Possee said he could fight the decision, but that would mean him spending his own money to launch a case at the High Court. He said the council ‘agreed in principle’ to protect the mural when he first approached them for help.

He added: 'I think it deserves to stay in Cheltenham, but obviously it is difficult to re-render a house that has that artwork on it. ‘It’s sat empty now, and it can’t stay that way forever. At the end of the day, we can sit and let gravity take an effect and the decision will be made for us.’ Mr Possee has even been targeted by men posing as ‘millionaire architects’ trying to buy the building, who turned out to be frauds. Controversy has surrounded the piece since its arrival, leaving the landlord inundated with ‘malicious messages’ from locals desperate to keep it in the town. He added: ‘Some busybody from Cheltenham even came up with this idea that I didn’t own that part of the house. 'There’s not a ""pretty strong certainty"" that I own it - it is certain that I do. I take a bit of umbrage with people getting involved with my business when it’s nothing to do with them. ‘I’ve had substantial offers from people who collect this kind of artwork - and if it was about money for me I’d have sold it by now.’ After listed status was granted last month, the council's case officer Martin Chandler said: 'It will be afforded a greater level of protection than it has currently. 'But it doesn't mean we won't be faced with future applications to consider other changes to it. It [planning consent] doesn't automatically mean it's going to be retained in situ.' Seeing the Banksy for the first time when he returned from holiday in April 2014, Mr Possee said he thought it was ‘quite nice’ and liked the new addition before the problems began.","Artwork was sprayed onto David Possee's house in Cheltenham last year .

"Ferguson's municipal court judge resigned Monday following a scathing report from the U.S. Department of Justice that was prompted by the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. Ronald J. Brockmeyer stepped down to help the city 'begin its healing process' and to promote public confidence in the court, he said through a spokesman. State appeals Judge Roy L. Richter was appointed by the Missouri Supreme Court to take his place and make 'needed reforms' in all of Ferguson's pending and future municipal court cases. Scroll down for video . Ferguson municipal court Judge Ronald J. Brockmeyer (left) resigned Monday following a scathing report from the U.S. Department of Justice. State appeals Judge Roy L. Richter (right) was appointed to take his place . Richter will be authorized to overhaul court policies in order to 'restore the integrity of the system' and ensure the respect of defendants' rights, according to the high court. He will start on March 16. Chief Justice Mary Russell said she believes Richter will bring a 'fresh, disinterested perspective' to the court. 'He is able and willing to implement needed reforms,' she said. 'Extraordinary action is warranted in Ferguson, but the Court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis.' Last Thursday two Ferguson Police Department commanders resigned after racist emails were released during the DOJ's investigation into the police department. Sgt. William Mudd and Capt. Rick Henke resigned Thursday and City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty was fired Wednesday. A Justice Department investigation found patterns of racial bias in the Ferguson police department and at the municipal jail and court. Brockmeyer stepped down to help the city 'begin its healing process', he said . It is unclear whether the three were recipients or senders of the 'racially biased' emails included in the 102-page civil rights report. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Henke was associated with a 2008 email suggesting that President Barack Obama would not complete a full presidential term because a black man can't hold 'a steady job for four years'. Mudd is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a New Orleans woman was paid by 'CrimeStoppers' to terminate her pregnancy. The Justice Department highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless, appearingly tribal, women dancing, with the caption 'Michelle Obama's High School Reunion.' The report states that the emails illustrate racial, ethnic, or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the DOJ's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week. In fact, the report states, there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails. Instead, the emails were forwarded along to others. Sgt. William Mudd (left) and Capt. Rick Henke (center) resigned from their positions Thursday and City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty (right) was fired over racially charged emails discovered in the report . *The list above is highlighted emails found in the DOJ's 102-page report on the Ferguson Police Department. The investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts. The report also adds that evidence found shows not only racial bias, 'but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case.' U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the DOJ's report 'searing,' saying the investigation found the Ferguson community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be 'disproportionately harmful to African-American residents.' 'This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized,' Holder said. 'A community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents. 'A community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue.' Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said Friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the DOJ, Reuters reports. The DOJ's civil rights investigation into the St. Louis suburb of 21,000 came after a white Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson (right) fatally shot an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown (left) on Aug. 9 . The grand jury's decision not to indict the Ferguson police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast Ferguson's mostly white police force in a negative light . Knowles did not comment on whether Police Chief Tom Jackson would step down, Reuters reports, amid calls for the chief to do so by some community and civil rights leaders. The report highlighted the department's practices, saying the city's focus on revenue greatly impacts the police department's approach to law enforcement and the role of Ferguson's municipal court. It states: 'The Ferguson Municipal Court handles most charges brought by the FPD, and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice, or protecting the rights of the accused, but of maximizing revenue.' The department also exhibited evidence of racial stereotyping, the report states. *The list above is highlighted evidence found in the DOJ's 102-page investigation into the Ferguson Police Department based on the department's findings and research . The report found that some practices of the Ferguson Police Department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the Fourth Amendment . The report highlighted the fact that African-Americans make 'extraordinary' efforts to pay off overly expensive tickets for often minor,  unfairly charged violations. Court records and emails show that while African-Americans struggled to pay the expensive tickets, city officials including the Municipal Judge, the court clerk, and department supervisors helped their friends, colleagues, and even themselves in eliminating tickets, fees, fines, and citations. The report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help. The clerk responded: 'Your ticket of $200 has magically disappeared! The report found that some practices of the Ferguson Police Department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause.","Ronald J.

Describing what happened on the day she died, she said: 'I was waiting for him to come back to our home and I knew when it got to five o'clock that something was not right.

North Yorkshire Police have received several responses after issuing an appeal for witnesses. But more are needed to piece together the circumstances around the accident. Mis Gregory said: 'I tried in December to find the driver but nothing came of it and it just strengthened my resolve to try and find them.

'Every time I was ever down or feeling upset, he'd always do his best to cheer me up by taking me to see the pigs near to us. 'He was such an animal lover and a lover of everything in general. 'He had such a massive impact on anyone who came into contact with him and everybody has told me that since he died.' Traffic constable Dave Seavers, of the North Yorkshire force's major collision investigation unit, is still looking for anyone who saw a car or bike driving along Pole Road at around 2pm on December 5.
